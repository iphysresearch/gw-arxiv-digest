**Abstract**: Scalar fields around black hole binaries in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Soumen Roy, Rodrigo Vicente, Josu C. Aurrekoetxea, Katy Clough, Pedro G. Ferreira Comment are welcome. A visualization of our simulations and waveforms can be found at this https URL General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Light scalar particles arise naturally in many extensions of the Standard Model and are well-motivated dark matter candidates. Gravitational interactions near black holes can trigger the growth of dense scalar configurations that, if sustained during inspiral, alter binary dynamics and imprint signatures on gravitational-wave signals. Detecting such effects would provide a novel probe of fundamental physics and dark matter. Here we develop a semi-analytic waveform model for binaries in scalar environments, validated against numerical relativity simulations, and apply it in a Bayesian analysis of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog. Our results set physically meaningful upper bounds on scalar environments around compact binaries. When superradiance priors are included, we find tentative evidence for such an environment in GW190728 with $\ln B_{\mathrm{vac}}^{\mathrm{env}} \approx 3.5$, which would correspond to the existence of a light scalar field with mass $\sim 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV}$.

**Abstract**: Comprehensive analysis of dissipative effects in the induced gravitational waves Yan-Heng Yu, Zhe Chang, Sai Wang 42 pages, 14 figures, 1 table, work for an invited talk (Oct. 25, 2025) at the 16th Asia Pacific Physics Conference (APPC16) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Dissipation is an intrinsic property of the cosmic fluid, leading to the damping of curvature perturbations at small scales. In this paper, we comprehensively study dissipative effects in gravitational waves induced by curvature perturbations, known as induced gravitational waves (IGWs). We find dissipative effects become especially significant at wavenumber $k \sim k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$, where $k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$ corresponds to the horizon scale at the decoupling of weakly-interacting particles. They can leave characteristic features on the IGW spectrum, including a notable suppression with a ``double-valley'' structure at $k \sim k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$ and a modified infrared behavior without logarithmic running at $k \lesssim k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$. Within the Standard Model of particle physics, dissipative effects caused by neutrinos at the nanohertz frequencies can be important in the analysis of pulsar timing array data. Furthermore, dissipation-induced features associated with possible new weakly-interacting particles can be detectable by a wide range of gravitational-wave experiments, serving as a promising probe of new physics at extremely high energy scales. As an extension, we also discuss dissipative effects in the presence of primordial non-Gaussianity and their impacts on the anisotropies of IGWs and the poltergeist mechanism. These dissipative effects not only provide a more realistic description of IGWs but also exhibit rich phenomenology and profound physical implications, opening a new window into understanding the early Universe and fundamental physics.

Rev. D High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The space mission LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), scheduled for launch in 2035, aims to detect gravitational wave (GW) signals in the milli-Hz band. In the context of ESA Voyage 2050 Call for new mission concepts, other frequency ranges are explored by the Gravitational-Wave Space 2050 Working Group to conceive new proposals for a post-LISA space-based detector. In this work, we give a preliminary estimate of the observational potential of three mission designs proposed in the literature, namely $\mu$Ares, AMIGO and the Decihertz Observatory. The analysis framework includes astrophysical GW sources such as massive black hole binaries, extreme mass-ratio inspirals and compact binaries such as stellar black holes and white dwarfs. For each detector, we first present a consistent computation of the unresolved gravitational wave background (GWB) produced by the sum of all anticipated astrophysical populations, using an iterative subtraction algorithm. We then investigate which types of systems are the most appealing, by measuring the number of GW signals detected and exploring the source properties.

## 4. Beware of the running $n_s$ when producing heavy primordial black holes

**Abstract**: Beware of the running $n_s$ when producing heavy primordial black holes Sasha Allegrini, Antonio J. Iovino, Hardi Veerm√§e Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We examine single-field inflationary models for the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). By analyzing the latest observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT)~\cite{ACT:2025fju, ACT:2025tim}, we demonstrate that the observed preference for positive running ($\alpha_s$) of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ imposes significant restrictions on the parameter space of ultra slow roll scenarios (USR). This tension becomes progressively pronounced for more massive PBHs, posing substantial challenges for USR models to yield a detectable PBH abundance, especially in the mass range probed by ongoing and future gravitational-wave experiments such as LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). However, this discrepancy is minimal for asteroid-mass PBHs, which are still capable of feasibly constituting the entirety of dark matter (DM). To numerically probe the six-dimensional parameter space of polynomial models, we adapted a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to efficiently scan over the space of viable models. Our results further indicate that, in non-minimally coupled polynomial inflation, a viable cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum is best obtained at an inflection point for which second-order slow-roll approximation is necessary for precise CMB predictions.

## 5. Reexamining Evidence of a Pair-Instability Mass Gap in the Binary Black Hole Population

**Abstract**: Reexamining Evidence of a Pair-Instability Mass Gap in the Binary Black Hole Population Anarya Ray, Vicky Kalogera High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The fourth gravitational wave transient catalog~(GWTC-4) has enabled empirical probes of the theorized pair-instability gap in the higher end of the binary black hole~(BBH) mass-spectrum. In this letter, using flexibly parametrized models, we show that at present there is no evidence of a sharp drop-off in the spectrum of black hole masses near $~40-50M_{\odot}$. We simultaneously characterize the transition in the distribution of BBH mass-ratios, effective aligned and effective precessing spins using our flexible models. From the transitions in our inferred spin and mass-ratio distributions, we find that the high-mass broad-spin sub-population has a significant fraction~($52^{+18}_{-23}\%$) of systems with mass ratios in the range $0.6-1$. This suggests that alternatives to the hypothesis of 2G+1G hierarchical systems dominating BBH formation above $\sim 40-50 M_{\odot}$ are more consistent with the GWTC-4 detection sample. By comparing with the predictions of star cluster simulations, we further show that contributions from (2G+2G) systems are not abundant enough to alleviate this discrepancy. We also demonstrate the effects of strong model assumptions on this inference, which can lead to biased astrophysical interpretation from restricted priors. We note that our results do not exclude that a high-mass gap may be identified as our sample size increases. We constrain the lower bound on the location of a possible PISN cutoff still allowed within measurement uncertainties to be $(57^{+17}_{-10}M_{\odot})$ and discuss its implications on the S factor of $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16}O$ at 300 kev.

**Abstract**: Gravitational-wave memory effects in the Damour-Esposito-Far√®se extension of Brans-Dicke theory Shammi Tahura, David A. Nichols, Kent Yagi 19 pages; Supplementary material available at this https URL v2: section I and III modified, detection prospect discussed in section III D, matches published version Phys.Rev.D 112 (2025) 8, 084037 General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Gravitational-wave memory effects are lasting changes in the strain and its time integrals. They can be computed in asymptotically flat spacetimes using the conservation and evolution equations in the Bondi-Sachs framework. Modified theories of gravity have additional degrees of freedom with their own asymptotic evolution equations; these additional fields can produce differences in the memory effects in these theories from those in general relativity. In this work, we study a scalar-tensor theory of gravity known as the Damour-Esposito-Far√®se extension of Brans-Dicke theory. We use the Bondi-Sachs framework to compute the field equations in Bondi-Sachs form, the asymptotically flat solutions, and the leading gravitational-wave memory effects. Although Damour-Esposito-Far√®se theory has additional nonlinearities not present in Brans-Dicke theory, these nonlinearities are subleading effects; thus, the two theories share many similarities in the leading (and some subleading) solutions to hypersurface equations, asymptotic symmetries, and types of memory effects. The conservation equations for the mass and angular momentum aspects differ between the two theories, primarily because of the differences in the evolution equation for the scalar field. This leads to differences in the time dependence of the gravitational-wave memory signals that are produced during the quasicircular inspiral of compact binaries. These differences, however, are of second-order in a small coupling parameter of these theories, which suggests that it would be challenging to use memory effects to distinguish between these two theories. Nevertheless, our results can be used to analyze and interpret memory effects from numerical-relativity simulations of binaries in this theory.

## 7. Overlapping signals in next-generation gravitational wave observatories: A recipe for selecting the best parameter estimation technique

**Abstract**: Overlapping signals in next-generation gravitational wave observatories: A recipe for selecting the best parameter estimation technique Tomasz Baka, Harsh Narola, Justin Janquart, Anuradha Samajdar, Tim Dietrich, Chris Van Den Broeck Phys. Rev. D 112, 082001 (2025) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Third-generation gravitational wave detectors such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will have significantly better sensitivities than current detectors, as well as a wider frequency bandwidth. This will increase the number and duration of the observed signals, leading to many signals overlapping in time. If not adequately accounted for, this can lead to biases in parameter estimation. In this work, we combine the joint parameter estimation method with relative binning to handle full parameter inference on overlapping signals from binary black holes, including precession effects and higher-order mode content. As this method is computationally more expensive than traditional single-signal parameter estimation, we test a prior-informed Fisher matrix and a time-frequency overlap method for estimating expected bias to help us decide when joint parameter estimation is necessary over the simpler methods. We improve upon previous Fisher matrix implementations by including the prior information and performing an optimization routine to better locate the maximum likelihood point point, but we still find the method unreliable. The time-frequency method is accurate in 86% of close binary black hole mergers. We end by developing our own method of estimating bias due overlaps, where we reweight the single signal parameter estimation posterior to quantify how much the overlapping signals affect it. We show it has 99% accuracy for zero noise injections (98% in Gaussian noise), at the cost of one additional standard sampling run when joint parameter estimation proves to be necessary.

## 8. Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals in relativistic accretion discs

**Abstract**: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals in relativistic accretion discs Francisco Duque, Laura Sberna, Andrew Spiers, Rodrigo Vicente General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We compute relativistic Lindblad torques for circular, equatorial extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) embedded in relativistic thin accretion discs, including spinning black hole configurations. We find that relativistic effects can amplify the magnitude of these torques by orders of magnitude in the strong-field regime, and that the torque can even reverse direction as the EMRI approaches the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). However, we show that the location of this reversal is highly spin-dependent, shifting progressively closer to the ISCO, where gravitational-wave emission completely dominates the inspiral, as the spin of the central black hole increases. Spin also modifies the radial dependence of the Lindblad torques. We investigate whether Lindblad torques can be approximated by parametrised power laws of the form T_LR = A(r_s / 10M)^n_r (or combinations thereof), and find significant spin- and disc-dependent variations in the slope parameter n_r. For instance, for spin a/M = 0.9, we find n_r = 3.6 in the strong-field regime, compared to the Newtonian value of n_r = 4.5. Given current forecasts of parameter recovery for ``golden'', loud EMRIs in accretion discs (\Delta n_r ~ 0.5), we predict LISA could distinguish between different disc configurations through their relativistic Lindblad torque signatures, providing the first direct probe of the midplane structure of the inner region of accretion discs, which is inaccessible to electromagnetic observations.

**Abstract**: Observable spins in gravitational waves from compact binary mergers Souradeep Pal General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We investigate the measurability of effective inspiral spin in the detectable compact binary mergers using gravitational-wave observations. Measurements from the latest gravitational-wave transient catalog do not rule out the existence of binary systems with non-zero effective spins. However, we observe an apparent correlation between the inferred effective inspiral spin and the loudness of the gravitational-wave events- loud events typically have close-to-zero effective spins whereas fainter events tend to be inferred with relatively arbitrary effective spins. Through simulations, we demonstrate that non-negligible effective spins can be systematically inferred from non-spinning systems at small signal strengths. These two observations support the possibility that the effective spin magnitudes in the observable compact binaries are generally small. Future detections can have potential impact on the understanding of their population and other astrophysical inferences.

## 10. Proof-of-Principle Experiment on a Displacement-Noise-Free Neutron Interferometer for Gravitational Wave Detection

Ground-based DFIs suffer from physical arm-length limitations, resulting in poor sensitivity at frequencies below 1 kHz. To address this, previous research introduced a neutron-based DFI, which replaces laser light with neutrons and achieves exceptional sensitivity down to a few hertz. In this study, we conducted a proof-of-principle experiment using a pulsed neutron source at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J- PARC). Despite practical constraints that led to deviations from the ideal experimental design, we optimized the setup and developed a novel analysis method that successfully cancels displacement noise while preserving simulated GW signals. This work presents the first successful demonstration of a neutron DFI and a neutron interferometer for GW detection.

## 11. New constraints on cosmological gravitational waves from CMB and BAO in light of dynamical dark energy

**Abstract**: New constraints on cosmological gravitational waves from CMB and BAO in light of dynamical dark energy Sai Wang, Zhi-Chao Zhao 12 pages, one column, 4 figures, 3 tables, to appear in the Chinese Physics C Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this work, we derive upper limits on the physical energy-density fraction today of cosmological gravitational waves, denoted by $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2}$, via analyzing \emph{Planck} \& ACT \& SPT CMB and DESI BAO data combination. In the standard cosmological model, we establish 95\% CL upper limits of $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} < 1.0 \times 10^{-6}$ for adiabatic initial conditions and $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} < 2.7 \times 10^{-7}$ for homogeneous initial conditions, assuming a uniform prior for $\Omega_{\rm gw}h^{2}$. In light of dynamical dark energy, we get $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} < 7.2 \times 10^{-7}$ (adiabatic) and $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} < 2.4 \times 10^{-7}$ (homogeneous). In contrast, if a log-uniform prior was assumed for $\Omega_{\rm gw}h^{2}$, these constraints can become tighter by a factor of $\sim4$, suggesting the results to be prior-sensitive. Furthermore, we project the sensitivity achievable with LiteBIRD \& CMB Stage-IV measurements of CMB and CSST observations of BAO, forecasting 68\% CL uncertainties of $\sigma = 2.5 \times 10^{-7}$ (adiabatic) and $\sigma = 1.0 \times 10^{-7}$ (homogeneous) for ${\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2}}$. The constraints we obtained in this work provide critical benchmarks for exploring the cosmological origins of gravitational waves within the frequency band $f \gtrsim 10^{-15}$\,Hz and potentially enable joint analysis with direct gravitational-wave detection sensitive to this regime.

Tompkins 27 pages, 18 figures, Submitted to ApJ on Oct 20th, 2025 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present an improved zodiacal light model, optimized for optical wavelengths, using archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging from the SKYSURF program. The Kelsall et. al. 1998 model used infrared imaging from the Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) on board the Cosmic Background Explorer to create a 3D structure of the interplanetary dust cloud. However, this model cannot accurately represent zodiacal light emission outside of DIRBE's nominal wavelength bandpasses, the bluest of which is 1.25 micron. We present a revision to this model (called ZodiSURF) that incorporates analytical forms of both the scattering phase function and albedo as a function of wavelength, which are empirically determined across optical wavelengths (0.3-1.6 micron) from over 5,000 HST sky surface brightness (sky-SB) measurements. This refined model results in significantly improved predictions of zodiacal light emission at these wavelengths and for Sun angles greater than 80 deg. Fits to HST data show an uncertainty in the model of ~4.5%. Remarkably, the HST sky-SB measurements show an excess of residual diffuse light (HST Sky - ZodiSURF - Diffuse Galactic Light) of 0.013 +/- 0.006 MJy/sr. The blue color of our diffuse light signal makes it unlikely to be of extragalactic origin. Instead, we suggest that a very dim spherical dust cloud may need to be included in the zodiacal light model, which we present here as a toy model.

## 13. Probing cosmology with bright sirens from the CosmoDC2_BCO LSST synthetic catalog

**Abstract**: Probing cosmology with bright sirens from the CosmoDC2_BCO LSST synthetic catalog Ranier Menote, Valerio Marra 17 pages, 3 figures and 5 tables Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Bright sirens, i.e. gravitational-wave detections of compact binary mergers with electromagnetic counterparts, provide a self-calibrated distance-redshift relation and are therefore powerful probes of cosmic expansion. Using the CosmoDC2_BCO catalog, we forecast cosmological constraints from current (LVK) and next-generation (ET, CE) detector networks, in combination with a Roman-like Type Ia supernova sample. We find that third-generation networks reach sub-percent precision on the Hubble constant within a few years, achieving 0.2% after a decade with CE+ET+LVK, while LVK remains limited to the 6% level. The LVK fifth observing run may shed light on the H_0 tension only if the inferred value falls outside the range spanned by the Planck and SH0ES determinations, which currently achieve far higher precisions. Supernovae do not directly tighten H_0 but stabilize its inference through parameter correlations and enable an absolute calibration of the supernova magnitude M_B. In dynamical dark-energy models, the joint analysis of Roman supernovae and bright sirens yields a Figure of Merit of 25 for ET+LVK and 76 for CE+ET+LVK, to be compared with the state-of-the-art DESI DR2 BAO plus DESY5 supernovae value of 56. Sky-localization thresholds of DeltaOmega < 50 deg^2, or even DeltaOmega < 10 deg^2, entail only mild penalties, suggesting efficient follow-up strategies. These results establish third-generation GW+EM observations, especially when combined with Roman supernovae, as a cornerstone for precision cosmology in the next decade.

## 14. $B$-sure I: Minkowski functionals as robustness test for tensor-to-scalar ratio detection from CMB observations

**Abstract**: $B$-sure I: Minkowski functionals as robustness test for tensor-to-scalar ratio detection from CMB observations Claudio Ranucci, Alessandro Carones, L√©o Vacher, Nicoletta Krachmalnicoff, Carlo Baccigalupi 28 pages, 14 figures, 3 tables. Prepared for submission to JCAP. Comments are welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The detection of primordial $B$-mode polarisation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is a major observational goal in modern Cosmology, offering a potential window into inflationary physics through the measurement of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. However, the presence of Galactic foregrounds poses significant challenges, possibly biasing the $r$ estimate. In this study we explore the viability of using Minkowski functionals (MFs) as a robustness test to validate a potential $r$ detection by identifying non-Gaussian features associated with foregrounds contamination. To do so, we simulate sky maps as observed by a LiteBIRD-like CMB experiment, with realistic instrumental and foregrounds modelling. The CMB $B$-mode signal is recovered through blind component separation algorithms, and the obtained (biased) value of $r$ is used to generate Gaussian realisation of CMB signal. Their MFs are then compared with those computed on maps contaminated by foreground residual left by component separation, looking for a detection of non-Gaussianity. Our results demonstrate that, with the experimental configuration considered here, MFs can not be reliably adopted as a robustness test of an eventual $r$ detection, as we find that in the majority of the cases MFs are not able to raise significant warnings about the non-Gaussianity induced by the presence of foreground residuals. In the most realistic and refined scenario we adopted, the test is able to flag non-Gaussianity in $\sim 26\%$ of the simulations, meaning that there is no warning on the biased tensor-to-scalar ratio in $\sim 74\%$ of cases. These results suggest that more advanced statistics than MFs must be considered to look for non-Gaussian signatures of foregrounds, in order to be able to perform reliable null tests in future CMB missions.

**Abstract**: Gravitational-wave and electromagnetic detections in the context of the CosmoDC2 LSST synthetic catalog Ranier Menote, Valerio Marra, Riccardo Sturani, Felipe Andrade-Oliveira, Cl√©cio R. Bom, The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We release CosmoDC2_BCO, a synthetic catalog of gravitational-wave events and electromagnetic counterparts associated with galaxies from CosmoDC2. The catalog provides intrinsic and extrinsic source parameters, signal-to-noise ratios, parameter uncertainties, sky localization areas, and kilonova apparent magnitudes in LSST filters. Our results show that third-generation detector networks substantially increase detection rates and improve parameter estimation. Second-generation detectors, when combined with third-generation ones, significantly enhance sky localization and distance precision, particularly for BNS mergers. Assuming a simplified Target of Opportunity strategy, we estimate that an LSST-like survey, partnered with the CE+ET+LVK network at 70% duty cycle, could detect about 5000 kilonovae with GW counterparts over a 10-year period on a 16000 deg^2 footprint, predominantly from low-mass BNS mergers that produce long-lived supermassive neutron star remnants. While this is a substantial number, it represents only a small fraction of the total neutron star mergers expected to be observed by third-generation networks. These projections rely on several simplifying assumptions-including the adopted merger rate, the kilonova luminosity distribution, and the configuration and scheduling of future surveys-which introduce notable uncertainties. Therefore, the estimated detection numbers should be interpreted with appropriate caution.

Napolitano, Lucas Porth, Mario Radovich, Peter Schneider, Tilman Tr√∂ster, Anna Wittje, Ziang Yan, Yun-Hao Zhang 38 pages, 24 figures, 7 tables, accepted for publication in A&A Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present cosmic shear constraints from the completed Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), where the cosmological parameter $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3} = 0.815^{+0.016}_{-0.021}$, is found to be in agreement ($0.73\sigma$) with results from the Planck Legacy cosmic microwave background experiment. The final KiDS footprint spans $1347$ square degrees of deep nine-band imaging across the optical and near-infrared, along with an extra $23$ square degrees of KiDS-like calibration observations of deep spectroscopic surveys. Improvements in our redshift distribution estimation methodology, combined with our enhanced calibration data and multi-band image simulations, allow us to extend our lensed sample out to a photometric redshift of $z_{\rm B}\leq2.0$. Compared to previous KiDS analyses, the increased survey area and redshift depth results in a $\sim32\%$ improvement in constraining power in terms of $\Sigma_8\equiv\sigma_8\left(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3\right)^\alpha = 0.821^{+0.014}_{-0.016}$, where $\alpha = 0.58$ has been optimised to match the revised degeneracy direction of $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$. We adopt a new physically motivated intrinsic alignment model that depends jointly on the galaxy sample's halo mass and spectral type distributions, and that is informed by previous direct alignment measurements. We also marginalise over our uncertainty on the impact of baryon feedback on the non-linear matter power spectrum. Comparing to previous KiDS analyses, we conclude that the increase seen in $S_8$ primarily results from our improved redshift distribution estimation and calibration, as well as new survey area and improved image reduction. Our companion paper St√∂lzner et al. (submitted) presents a full suite of internal and external consistency tests, finding the KiDS-Legacy data set to be the most internally robust sample produced by KiDS to date.

Submitted to ApJL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) AT2025ulz is an optical/near-infrared transient discovered during follow-up of the candidate gravitational wave (GW) event S250818k. Its young age ($\lesssim$1 d), rapid decline and strong color evolution over the first 48 hr classify it as a potential kilonova candidate. In this work, we present the results of our observing campaign, carried out with the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Although the early time evolution of AT2025ulz resembles some aspects of a kilonova, its rapid onset ($\sim$3 hr after the GW trigger) and luminosity (a factor of $\sim5$ brighter than AT2017gfo in $g$-band) are difficult to reproduce. Only a small subset of our kilonova models matches its multi-color light curve, and the inferred ejecta mass is uncomfortably large given the low chirp mass ($\lesssim\!0.87\!$ M$_{\odot}$) of the GW candidate. HST observations place the transient within a nearby ($z=0.08489$) spiral galaxy with on-going star-formation and measure a color ($F336W-F160W\!\approx\!1.4$ mag) that is too blue to match with a kilonova. Our data support the classification of AT2025ulz as a supernova, initially undergoing a shock-cooling phase and later entering its photospheric phase, and spectroscopically identified via its broad absorption features.

## 18. Generalized Perturbed Kepler Problem: Gravitational Wave Imprints from Eccentric Compact Binaries

**Abstract**: Generalized Perturbed Kepler Problem: Gravitational Wave Imprints from Eccentric Compact Binaries Rajes Ghosh, R. Prasad, Kabir Chakravarti, Prayush Kumar 17 pages, 7 figures. Updated GW phase and cumulative dephasing expressions. Added Fisher analysis General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Observations of astrophysical binaries may reveal departures from pure Keplerian orbits due to environmental influences, modifications to the underlying gravitational dynamics, or signatures of new physics. In this work, we develop a unified framework to systematically study such perturbations in the ambit of the perturbed Kepler problem and explore their impact on eccentric orbital dynamics and gravitational wave emission. Unlike traditional parametrized frameworks such as post-Newtonian and post-Einsteinian expansions, our approach offers a more source-specific modeling strategy, making it more natural to trace the physical origins of eccentric binary model parameters. Starting from a general perturbed potential, we derive the modified orbit and compute the associated gravitational fluxes and phase evolution, assessing their observational relevance for both current and future detectors. This framework thus offers a general and physically transparent toolkit for probing such subtle deviations from standard dynamics in gravitational wave data.

Wahl 20 pages, 11 figures, Submitted to APJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Wideband timing of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) datasets, where a single time-of-arrival (TOA) and a single dispersion measure (DM) are measured using the entire bandwidth of each observation, was first done for the 12.5-year dataset, and proved to be invaluable for characterizing the time-varying dispersion measure, reducing the data volume, and for improving the overall timing precision. The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) Telescope has been observing most NANOGrav millisecond pulsars (MSPs) at nearly daily cadence (compared to roughly monthly cadence for other NANOGrav observations) since 2019 with the objective of integration into future pulsar timing array (PTA) datasets. In this paper, we show the results of integration of high-cadence, low-observing-frequency CHIME data with data from the NANOGrav experiment for an isolated MSP PSR J0645$+$5158 and three binary MSPs PSR J1012$+$5307, PSR J2145$-$0750, and PSR J2302$+$4442. Using a wideband timing pipeline which we also describe, we present updated timing results for all four sources, including improvements in measurements of relativistic post-Keplerian parameters for the three binary pulsars in this analysis. For PSR J2302$+$4442, we report an updated strong detection of Shapiro delay from which we measured a companion mass of $0.35^{+0.05}_{-0.04}\ M_{\odot}$, a pulsar mass of $1.8^{+0.3}_{-0.3}\ M_{\odot}$, and an orbital inclination of ${80^{\circ}}^{+1}_{-2}$. We also report updated constraints on the reflex motion for PSR J2145$-$0750 using a combination of Very Long Baseline Array astrometry and our updated measurement of the time derivative of the projected semi-major axis of the pulsar orbit as a prior.
