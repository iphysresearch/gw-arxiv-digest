## 1. The Missing Multipole Problem: Investigating biases from model starting frequency in gravitational-wave analyses

**Abstract**: The Missing Multipole Problem: Investigating biases from model starting frequency in gravitational-wave analyses Ryan Ursell, Charlie Hoy, Ian Harry, Laura K. Nuttall 15 pages, 10 figures, 5 appendices General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Our ability to infer the true source properties of colliding black holes from gravitational wave observations requires not only accurate waveform models but also their correct use. A key property when evaluating time-domain models is when to start the waveform: choosing a time that is too late can omit low-frequency power from higher order multipoles. By focusing on binary systems with total mass $\ge 200 \, M_{\odot}$, we show that current detectors are sensitive to this missing power and biased source properties can be obtained. We show that for systems with total mass $\lesssim 300 \, M_{\odot}$, mass ratio $\gtrsim 0.33$, and signal-to-noise ratio $\rho \gtrsim 20$, templates starting at $20 \, \mathrm{Hz}$ recover biased source properties. As the total mass increases, and the component masses become more asymmetric, templates starting from $13 \, \mathrm{Hz}$ recover biased properties. If the gravitational-wave signal is observed at signal-to-noise ratio $\rho < 20$, time-domain models can start from $20\, \mathrm{Hz}$ as statistical uncertainties dominate.

## 2. Impact of Neutrino Flavor Conversions on Neutron Star Merger Dynamics, Ejecta, Nucleosynthesis, and Multi-Messenger Signals

**Abstract**: Impact of Neutrino Flavor Conversions on Neutron Star Merger Dynamics, Ejecta, Nucleosynthesis, and Multi-Messenger Signals Yi Qiu, David Radice, Sherwood Richers, Federico Maria Guercilena, Albino Perego, Maitraya Bhattacharyya 19 pages, 13 figures, will be submitted to Phys.Rev.D High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We present numerical relativity simulations of binary neutron star mergers incorporating neutrino flavor transformations triggered by fast flavor instability, quantum many-body effects, or potential beyond standard model physics. In both long-lived and short-lived remnant scenarios, neutrino flavor conversions modify species-dependent neutrino luminosities and mean energies, and drive the matter towards more neutron rich conditions. They produce up to $300\%$ more neutron rich ejecta and significantly boost the r-process yields, especially in low-density, near-equatorial outflows. We identify regions unstable to fast flavor instabilities and find that these instabilities persist despite flavor conversions. We further test the sensitivity to the equilibration timescale of the flavor conversions, finding that slower flavor conversions can interact with thermodynamic equilibration, and increase the neutron richness of the ejecta. Flavor conversions may also contribute to stronger gravitational wave and neutrino emissions, pointing to a correlation between neutrino transport and merger dynamics. These results highlight the potential impact of flavor conversions while motivating future work to improve on theoretical understanding of flavor instabilities in global simulations.

## 3. Atomic Quantum Sensors for High-Frequency Gravitational Wave Searches

**Abstract**: Atomic Quantum Sensors for High-Frequency Gravitational Wave Searches Yi-fu Cai, Luca Visinelli, Sheng-Feng Yan High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex) High-frequency gravitational waves represent an unexplored frontier of gravitational physics. While pulsar timing arrays reach nHz frequencies and ground-based interferometers probe the audio band, the regime above the MHz scale remains essentially untested. We propose a hybrid detection framework in which gravitons convert to photons via the Gertsenshtein effect in strong magnetic fields; the resulting electromagnetic signal is resonantly enhanced in a cavity and read out by atomic quantum sensors. Our approach combines multiple channels, including long-coherence Raman interferometry in alkali atoms, microwave Rydberg transitions, photoionization-based detection, and inner-shell electronic resonances. We derive the graviton-photon conversion probability, compute the induced photon flux, and estimate the shot-noise-limited spectral strain noise density. Depending on configuration, the projected shot-noise-limited sensitivity ranges from $\sqrt{S_{h, {\rm min}}} \sim 10^{-22}{\rm\,Hz^{-1/2}}$ in conservative microwave implementations to $\sqrt{S_{h, {\rm min}}} \sim 10^{-37}{\rm\,Hz^{-1/2}}$ in aggressive optical Raman schemes, potentially surpassing the cosmological bound from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis for stochastic backgrounds, while coherent bursts remain unconstrained and detectable. Such reach allows to test scenarios involving primordial black holes, topological defects, violent phase transitions, and (p)reheating, motivating advances in high-$Q$ cavities, strong-field magnets, and quantum-limited atomic sensors, with broad impact across quantum metrology and fundamental physics.

## 4. Taming the plunge: A circularization trap of supermassive black hole binaries

**Abstract**: Taming the plunge: A circularization trap of supermassive black hole binaries Pau Amaro Seoane, Alessandra Mastrobuono Battisti, Chingis Omarov, Denis Yurin, Maxim Makukov, Dana Kuvatova, Gulnara Omarova, Anton Gluchshenko Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate the orbital eccentricity evolution of supermassive black hole binaries within galactic environments. We analyze the dynamics in triaxial merger remnants and subsequent interactions with geometrically thick nuclear discs. We confirm that gravitational torques in triaxial potentials efficiently extract angular momentum, resulting in binary formation with high initial eccentricities. We then analyze the binary-disc interaction using a 3D analytical framework incorporating the Airy formalism and potential softening. We present a self-consistent derivation demonstrating that the 3D suppression of high-order torques leads to distinct scalings with disc thickness ($h$): migration rates $\tau_a^{-1} \propto h^{-3}$ and eccentricity damping rates $\tau_e^{-1} \propto h^{-5}$. This establishes a timescale hierarchy, $\tau_e/\tau_a \propto h^2$. For typical parameters ($h\approx 0.2$), eccentricity damping is significantly faster than orbital decay ($\tau_e \approx 0.04 \, \tau_a$). We further develop a wavelet-based formalism to quantify the impact of disc inhomogeneities arising from accretion feedback and turbulence. We derive the stochastic torque variance in the wavelet domain and employ a Fokker-Planck analysis to determine the equilibrium eccentricity distribution. While stochastic fluctuations counteract deterministic damping, the strong damping imposed by the thick disc geometry ensures the equilibrium eccentricity remains small unless the fluctuations are highly non-linear. Hence, even if born highly eccentric, SMBHBs are rapidly circularized. This circularization trap forces binaries to approach the gravitational wave-dominated regime on nearly circular orbits, prolonging the total merger timescale. This introduces a substantial cosmological delay governed by stellar relaxation, which impacts detection rates and the modeling of SMBH assembly in cosmological frameworks.

## 5. Strong gravitational-wave lensing posterior odds

**Abstract**: Strong gravitational-wave lensing posterior odds Otto A. Hannuksela, K. Haris, Justin Janquart, Harsh Narola, Hemantakumar Phurailatpam, Jolien D. E. Creighton, Chris Van Den Broeck High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Like light, gravitational waves are gravitationally lensed by intervening massive astrophysical objects, such as galaxies, clusters, black holes, and stars, resulting in a variety of potentially observable gravitational-wave lensing signatures. Searches for gravitational-wave lensing by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration have begun. One common method focuses on strong gravitational-wave lensing, which produces multiple "images": repeated copies of the same gravitational wave that differ only in amplitude, arrival time, and overall "Morse phase." The literature identifies two separate approaches to identifying such repeated gravitational-wave events based on frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Several works have discussed selection effects and identified challenges similar to the well-known "birthday problem", namely, the rapidly increasing likelihood of false alarms in an ever-growing catalogue of event pairs. Here, we discuss these problems, unify the different approaches in Bayesian language, and derive the posterior odds for strong lensing. In particular, the Bayes factor and prior odds are sensitive to the number of gravitational-wave events in the data, but the posterior odds are insensitive to it once strong lensing time delays are accounted for. We confirm Lo et al.'s (2020) finding that selection effects enter the Bayes factor as an overall normalisation constant. However, this factor cancels out in the posterior odds and does not affect frequentist approaches to strong lensing detection.

**Abstract**: From Localization to Discovery: Bayesian Ranking of Electromagnetic Counterparts to Gravitational-Wave Events Kendall Ackley Invited article for special CQG issue on Gravitational Wave Physics and Astrophysics Ten Years After GW150914 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The robust association of electromagnetic candidates discovered during follow-up of gravitational-wave alerts is challenging, not only due to the large sky areas and broad distance uncertainties, but also due to the tens to hundreds of unrelated optical transients that are observed per event. We present a Bayesian ranking method to identify electromagnetic counterparts to GW events using only location information. The framework combines three-dimensional gravitational wave skymaps with host-galaxy information, a morphology-aware host association, empirical offset priors, and peculiar velocity corrections. We apply the method to GW170817 where it ranks AT2017gfo as the top candidate and correctly selects NGC\,4993 as the host. The approach is directly applicable to transient candidates with only location information and enables more efficient follow-up with prioritized candidates and leads to more reliable counterpart identification in current and future observing runs.

## 7. Quasinormal Modes and Gray-Body Factors for Gravitational Perturbations in Asymptotically Safe Gravity

**Abstract**: Quasinormal Modes and Gray-Body Factors for Gravitational Perturbations in Asymptotically Safe Gravity B. C. Lütfüoğlu General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) A quantum-corrected black hole model arising from gravitational collapse in the framework of Asymptotically Safe Gravity was recently proposed in [A. Bonanno, D. Malafarina, A. Panassiti, Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 031401 (2024)]. Quantum correction becomes considerable for Planck-scale black holes and strongly deviates from the Schwarzschild solution near the event horizon, quickly merging with the Schwarzschild metric in the far region. While quasinormal modes and gray-body factors have been analyzed for test fields in this background, no such analysis has yet been performed for gravitational perturbations. In this work, we study axial gravitational perturbations of these black holes by modeling the effective quantum corrections through an anisotropic fluid energy-momentum tensor. We compute both quasinormal modes and gray-body factors, and show that quantum corrections enhance the quality factor of the oscillations, thereby making the quantum-corrected black hole a more efficient gravitational wave emitter. At asymptotically late times, the power-law decay is indistinguishable from Price's tails, which behave as \( \sim t^{-(2\ell + 3)} \), where \( \ell \) is the multipole number. We also demonstrate that quantum corrections lead to a suppression of the gray-body factors and examine the validity of the correspondence between gray-body factors and quasinormal modes.

## 8. Gravitationally induced decoherence of a scalar field: investigating the one-particle sector and its interplay with renormalisation

**Abstract**: Gravitationally induced decoherence of a scalar field: investigating the one-particle sector and its interplay with renormalisation Max Joseph Fahn, Kristina Giesel 75 pages including 35 pages of appendices. v2: The text has been updated with minor changes to bring it into line with the published version; updated some references, changed the discussion in A.IV.1 Class.Quant.Grav. 42 (2025) 17, 175019 High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate the one-particle sector for the field-theoretical model of gravitationally induced decoherence for a scalar field in [1] with a special focus on the renormalisation of the one-particle master equation. In contrast to existing models in the literature, where the renormalisation is usually performed after the Markov and rotating wave approximation and often only for certain limits such as the non- or ultra-relativistic limit, here we apply the renormalisation directly after the one-particle projection. With this strategy, we show that UV-divergent contributions in the one-particle master equation can be identified with the vacuum contributions in the self-energy of the scalar field in the effective quantum field theory and depending on the chosen one-particle projection method, its vacuum bubbles, while the additional thermal contributions in the self-energy are all UV-finite. To obtain the renormalised one-particle master equation, we use an on-shell renormalisation procedure of the underlying effective QFT. We then apply the Markov and rotating wave approximation, specifying a condition under which the Markov approximation can be applied in the case of the ultra-relativistic limit. We compare our results with those available in the literature. This includes an analysis of two different kinds of one-particle projections, a comparison of the application and effects of renormalisation of quantum mechanical and field theoretical models, the non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic limits of the renormalised one-particle master equations, and a comparison with a quantum mechanical toy model for gravitationally induced decoherence in the context of neutrino oscillations.

## 9. Gravitational waves from low-scale cosmic strings without scaling

Rev. D Phys. Rev. D 112, 083517 (2025) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Cosmic strings are predicted in many extensions of the Standard Model and constitute a plausible source of gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. In a previous article arXiv:2405.10937v2, we pointed out that the GW spectrum from a population of string loops in the scaling regime can exhibit a sharp cutoff frequency associated with the fundamental oscillation mode of string loops. In this paper, we study the effect of particle decay due to kink-kink collisions and cusps on the GW spectrum in the nonscaling scenario introduced in Ref. arXiv:1911.12066. We find analytical conditions for the existence of a cutoff frequency in the fundamental spectrum and provide expressions for this frequency. In large regions of parameter space, our results in the nonscaling model turn out to be identical to those in the scaling model. Finally, we demonstrate how the spectrum changes when transitioning from the regime with a cutoff frequency to the regime without a cutoff frequency. Our analytical estimates are validated at qualitatively different benchmark points by comparing them with numerical spectra.

## 10. Quantum Search for Gravitational Wave of Massive Black Hole Binaries

**Abstract**: Quantum Search for Gravitational Wave of Massive Black Hole Binaries Fangzhou Guo, Jibo He Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph) Matched filtering is a common method for detecting gravitational waves. However, the computational costs of searching large template banks limit the efficiency of classical algorithms when searching for massive black hole binary (MBHB) systems. This work explores the application of a quantum matched filtering algorithm based on Grover's algorithm to MBHB signals. Under certain simplifying assumptions, quantum approach can reduce the computational complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(\sqrt{N})$ theoretically, where $N$ is the size of the template bank. Simulated results illustrate the potential reduction in computational costs, while also showing that the performance can degrade in some cases due to instability of the algorithm. These findings reveal both the potential and the limitations of quantum search for MBHB signals, pointing to the importance of developing more robust and stable search strategies alongside realistic modeling in future work.

## 11. Exploring Ultra-Slow-Roll Inflation in Composite Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson Models: Implications for Primordial Black Holes and Gravitational Waves

**Abstract**: Exploring Ultra-Slow-Roll Inflation in Composite Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson Models: Implications for Primordial Black Holes and Gravitational Waves Marco Merchand Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We study inflation driven by a scalar potential arising from composite-sector dynamics, inspired by generalized composite Higgs models. The introduction of a non-minimal coupling, possessing the same functional form as the potential, induces a flattening at large field values that enables successful inflation. We analyze the conditions for ultra-slow-roll inflation, which leads to enhanced curvature perturbations, by combining analytical criteria near the inflection point with comprehensive numerical scans of the parameter space. The region consistent with Cosmic Microwave Background constraints and yielding approximately $N_e \approx 55\text{-}60$ e-folds also predicts primordial black holes with masses in the range $10^3\text{-}10^5\,\mathrm{g}$. Although such ultra-light primordial black holes are typically expected to have evaporated, recent proposals invoking evaporation suppression via memory-burden effects could allow their survival as viable dark matter candidates. Under this assumption, the induced gravitational wave signal peaks in a frequency gap between standard interferometers and resonant-cavity experiments, motivating exploration of this observational frontier.

## 12. Assessing the Distance for Probing the Nuclear Equation of State with Supernova Gravitational Waves

Comments and suggestions are welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae provide a unique probe of the equation of state (EOS) of high density matter. In this work, we focus on the bounce signal from numerical simulations of rotating supernovae and explore its potential for EOS inference. We employ a support vector machine, previously shown to perform best among tested methods, to classify GW signals simulated for 18 EOS models. For optimally oriented sources, we estimate that the Advanced LIGO A+ detector can probe the EOS for Galactic events, while third-generation observatories such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer can reach substantially farther. For randomly oriented sources, only these next-generation detectors are expected to have sufficient sensitivity. These results represent the potential observational range for probing the nuclear EOS, although, due to the simplifying assumptions adopted, they should be regarded as approximate upper limits.

## 13. J-GEM near-infrared follow-up observations of the gravitational wave event S240422ed

Accepted for publication in PASJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We report our near-infrared (NIR) follow-up observations of the gravitational wave (GW) event S240422ed using the Subaru Telescope/MOIRCS. S240422ed was initially classified as a black hole-neutron star merger with $>$ 99% probability of electromagnetic wave emission. We started follow-up observations 7.8 hours after the event. Over two nights, we observed 206 nearby galaxies in $Y$ and $K_{\rm s}$ bands down to about 21.4 and 21.1 AB mag (3$\sigma$), respectively. The total completeness of our survey based on galaxy $B$-band luminosity is 22%. As a result of our observations, five candidate counterparts were identified. We show that properties of these five objects are not consistent with kilonova such as AT2017gfo. Four objects are consistent with known classes of transients such as supernovae or dwarf nova outbursts. On the other hand, the nature of the remaining one object, which shows a red color and rapid decline, remains unclear. Although later analyses of GW signal reclassified S240422ed as likely terrestrial noise, our NIR observations provide valuable lessons for future NIR surveys for GW sources. We demonstrate that deep NIR follow-up observations as presented in this work would effectively constrain the presence of red kilonova even at 200 Mpc distance. We also discuss the importance of deep and wide NIR reference images and of understanding the properties and frequency of Galactic transients.

## 14. Spins of Black Holes in X-ray Binaries and the Tension with the Gravitational Wave Measurements

**Abstract**: Spins of Black Holes in X-ray Binaries and the Tension with the Gravitational Wave Measurements Andrzej A. Zdziarski, Gregoire Marcel, Alexandra Veledina, Aleksandra Olejak, Debora Lancova Resubmitted to New Astronomy Review; extended and updated to include the GWTC-4.0 results. Comments are welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We review current challenges in understanding the values and origin of the spins of black holes in binaries. Thanks to recent advances in astrophysical instrumentation, the spins can now be measured using both gravitational waves emitted by merging black holes and electromagnetic radiation from accreting X-ray binaries containing black holes. A key finding of the gravitational-wave observatories is that premerger black holes in binaries have low spin values, with an average dimensionless spin parameter of $a_*\sim$0.1--0.2, with 90\% having $a_*\lesssim 0.6$. This implies that the natal spins of black holes are generally low, and the angular momentum transport in massive stars is efficient. On the other hand, most of the published spins in X-ray binaries are very high. In particular, this is the case for binaries with high-mass donors (potential progenitors of mergers), where their published spins range from 0.8 to 1.0. At the same time, their short lifetimes prevent significant spin-up by accretion. Those with low-mass donors could be spun-up to $a_*\gtrsim 0.7$ by accretion only if the donor initial masses were more than several solar masses, which remains unproven. However, the existing methods of spin measurements suffer from significant systematic errors. The method relying on relativistic X-ray line broadening is based on the separation of the observed spectra into incident and reflected ones, which is highly uncertain. The method relying on spectral fitting of accretion disk continua uses models that predict the disk to be highly unstable, while stability is observed. Improved stable models predict lower spins. The published spin measurements in X-ray binaries are uncertain. The spins of the binaries with high-mass donors may be low, while those with low-mass donors have a broader spin distribution, ranging from low to high.
