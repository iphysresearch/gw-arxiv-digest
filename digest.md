## 1. Accuracy of ringdown models calibrated to numerical relativity simulations

**Abstract**: Accuracy of ringdown models calibrated to numerical relativity simulations Francesco Crescimbeni, Gregorio Carullo, Emanuele Berti, Giada Caneva Santoro, Mark Ho-Yeuk Cheung, Paolo Pani General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) The ''ringdown'' stage of gravitational-wave signals from binary black hole mergers, mainly consisting of a superposition of quasinormal modes emitted by the merger remnant, is a key tool to test fundamental physics and to probe black hole dynamics. However, ringdown models are known to be accurate only in the late-time, stationary regime. A key open problem in the field is to understand if these models are robust when extrapolated to earlier times, and if they can faithfully recover a larger portion of the signal. We address this question through a systematic time-domain calculation of the mismatch between non-precessing, quasi-circular ringdown models parameterised by the progenitor binary's degrees of freedom and full numerical relativity inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) simulation catalog. For the best-performing models, the mismatch is typically in the range $[10^{-6}, 10^{-4}]$ for the $(\ell,|m|)= (2,2)$ harmonic, and $[10^{-4}, 10^{-2}]$ for higher-order modes. Our findings inform ongoing observational searches for quasinormal modes, and underscore the need for improved modeling of higher-order modes to meet the sensitivity requirements of future gravitational-wave detectors.

**Abstract**: Gravitational waves in Cubic Metric-Affine Gravity Sebastian Bahamonde, Jorge Gigante Valcarcel, José M. M. Senovilla General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We derive new exact gravitational wave solutions with dynamical torsion and nonmetricity tensors in the framework of cubic Metric-Affine Gravity (MAG). For this purpose, we consider the full algebraic classification of the gravitational field in general metric-affine geometries and impose a set of Type N conditions on the field strength tensors that implement the kinetics of torsion and nonmetricity in a particular cubic MAG model, recently considered to eliminate ghostly instabilities from the vector and axial sectors of the theory. The new solutions represent pp-waves characterised by a metric function that includes the dynamical contributions of the torsion and nonmetricity tensors provided by the field equations of the model. In particular, these quantities induce a scalar polarisation mode in the gravitational-wave spectrum, thus offering a distinctive phenomenological signature beyond the ordinary tensor polarisation modes of General Relativity.

## 3. Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals Embedded in Dark Matter Halo I:Existence of Homoclinic Orbit and Near-Horizon Chaos

**Abstract**: Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals Embedded in Dark Matter Halo I:Existence of Homoclinic Orbit and Near-Horizon Chaos Surajit Das, Surojit Dalui, Bum-Hoon Lee, Yi-Fu Cai General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD) We study the existence of homoclinic orbit and the onset of chaotic motion for a massive particle moving around a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a Dehnen-(1,4,5/2) type dark matter halo, within the extreme-mass-ratio limit q = m/M << 1, where m and M are the masses of the particle and the central black hole, respectively. The presence of the halo modifies the spacetime curvature and consequently deforms the effective potential governing the particle's motion. Using the Hamiltonian formulation, we derive the conditions under which unstable circular orbit and the associated homoclinic trajectory arise, marking the separatrix between bound and plunging motion. By analyzing the effective potential and the corresponding phase-space structure, we identify the transition from regular to chaotic dynamics in the near-horizon region. Numerical analyses through Poincare sections and Lyapunov exponents calculations demonstrate that increasing the halo density, scale radius along with energy amplifies nonlinear effects which leads to chaos eventually. We demonstrate that within a dark matter halo environment, the dynamical stability of particle motion can be significantly altered without violating the universal surface gravity bound on chaos. This work provides a deeper understanding of horizon-induced chaos in astrophysically realistic environments and serves as a theoretical basis for exploring its possible imprints on gravitational wave signals in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals system.

## 4. The First Upper Bound on the Non-Stationary Gravitational Wave Background and its Implication on the High Redshift Binary Black Hole Merger Rate

**Abstract**: The First Upper Bound on the Non-Stationary Gravitational Wave Background and its Implication on the High Redshift Binary Black Hole Merger Rate Mohit Raj Sah, Suvodip Mukherjee High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The high redshift merger rate and mass distribution of black hole binaries (BHBs) is a direct probe to distinguish astrophysical black holes (ABHs) and primordial black holes (PBHs), which can be studied using the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background (SGWB). The conventional analyses solely based on the power spectrum are limited in constraining the properties of the underlying source population under the assumption of a non-sporadic Gaussian distribution. However, recent studies have shown that SGWB will be sporadic and non-Gaussian in nature, which will cause non-zero 'spectral correlation' depending on the high redshift merger rate and mass distribution of the compact objects. In this work, we present the first spectral covariance analysis of the SGWB using data from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration during the third and the first part of the fourth observing runs. Our analysis indicates that the current spectral correlation is consistent with non-stationary noise, yielding no detection from the current data and providing only upper bounds between frequencies in the range 25 Hz to 100 Hz. This upper bound on the spectral correlation translates to the upper bounds on the mass-dependent merger rate of PBHs between $2.4\times10^{4}$ and $2.3\times10^{2} \rm ~Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ (at ${\rm z} = 1 $ ) with a log-normal mass distribution with median masses between $20 ~M_{\odot}$ and $120 ~M_{\odot}$. This provides a stringent upper bound on the PBH merger rate at high redshift and hence puts constraints on the PBH formation scenario even in the presence of large spatial clustering. In the future, detection of this signal will lead to direct evidence of the high-redshift black hole population using gravitational waves.

**Abstract**: New gravitational wave polarization modes in the torsionless spacetime Yu-Qi Dong, Xiao-Bin Lai, Yu-Zhi Fan, Yu-Xiao Liu 26 pages+6 appendices, 3 figures, published version Eur. Phys. J. C 85, 1249 (2025) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) In this study, we investigate the polarization properties of gravitational waves within a torsionless spacetime framework, as described by the Palatini formalism. Our analysis uncovers the presence of two novel polarization modes, referred to as shear modes, which extend beyond the traditional set of six modes in a four-dimensional Riemannian spacetime. These shear modes, uniquely driven by vector degrees of freedom associated with non-metricity, are classified as vector modes, and their detection provides a unique opportunity to explore the fundamental structure of spacetime and to test gravity theories. These modes extend the standard gravitational wave polarization paradigm and provide novel observational signatures for gravitational wave detectors.

**Abstract**: Distinguishing Distance Duality breaking models using electromagnetic and gravitational waves measurements Chiara De Leo, Matteo Martinelli, Rocco D'Agostino, Giulia Gianfagna, Carlos J. A. P. Martins 23 pages, 6 figures. Matching version published by JCAP Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Several assumptions at the foundation of the standard cosmological model have as a direct consequence a specific relation between cosmological distances, known as the distance duality relation, whose violation would be a smoking gun of deviations from standard cosmology. We explore the role of upcoming gravitational wave observations in investigating possible deviations from the distance duality relation, alongside the more commonly used supernovae. We find that, when combined with baryon acoustic oscillations, gravitational waves will provide similar constraining power to the combination of baryon acoustic oscillations and supernovae. Moreover, the combination of observables with different sensitivities to electromagnetic and gravitational physics provides a promising way to discriminate among different physical mechanisms that could lead to violations of the distance duality relation.

## 7. Equation of state during (p)reheating with trilinear interactions

**Abstract**: Equation of state during (p)reheating with trilinear interactions Stefan Antusch, Kenneth Marschall, Francisco Torrenti 20 pages + references, 12 figures. Minor changes to match published version Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We characterize the post-inflationary evolution of the equation of state of the universe from the end of inflation until the onset of radiation domination, when the inflaton is coupled to a daughter field through a trilinear interaction. We consider an inflaton potential that is quadratic near the minimum and flattens in the inflationary regime. By simulating the dynamics in 2+1-dimensional lattices, we have tracked the long-term evolution of the equation of state for about ten e-folds of expansion, for various coupling strengths. The trilinear interaction initially excites daughter field modes through a process of tachyonic resonance immediately after inflation and triggers a temporary deviation of the equation of state from $\bar{w} = 0$ to a maximum value $\bar{w} = \bar{w}_{\rm max} < 1/3$. However, at much later times, the inflaton homogeneous mode once again dominates the energy density, pushing the equation of state towards $\bar{w} = 0$ until the onset of perturbative reheating. By combining the lattice results with a Boltzmann approach, we characterize the entire post-inflationary expansion history, which allows to calculate precise predictions for the inflationary CMB observables. We also accurately compute the redshift of the stochastic gravitational wave background produced during preheating, and show that taking the temporary return of the equation of state towards $\bar{w} = 0$ into account can reduce the amplitude by many orders of magnitude relative to previous estimates.

## 8. Measuring scattering variations in pulsar timing observations: A test of the fidelity of current methods

**Abstract**: Measuring scattering variations in pulsar timing observations: A test of the fidelity of current methods A. D. Kulkarni, R. M. Shannon, D. J. Reardon, M. T. Miles High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The turbulent nature of the ionised interstellar medium (IISM) causes dispersion measure (DM) and scattering variations in pulsar timing measurements. To improve precision of gravitational wave measurements, pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have begun the use of sophisticated and intricate noise modelling techniques such as modelling stochastic variations induced by the turbulent IISM and quasi-deterministic processes attributed to discrete structures. However, the reliability of these techniques has not been studied in detail, and it is unclear whether the recovered processes are physical or if they are impacted by misspecification. In this work, we present an analysis to test the efficacy of IISM noise models based on the data from the MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array (MPTA) 4.5-year data release. We first performed multi-frequency, long-length (500 refractive length scale) simulations of multipath propagation in the IISM to study the properties of scattering variations under a variety of scattering conditions. The results of our simulations show the possibility of significant radio-frequency decorrelation in the scattering variations, particularly for the anisotropic scattering medium. Our analysis of the observed DM and scattering variations using the MPTA 4.5-year data set shows that there can be apparent anticorrelations between DM and scattering variations, which we attribute to the model fitting methods. We also report a possibility that plasma underdensities might exist along the sight lines of PSR J1431$-$5740 and PSR J1802$-$2124. Finally, using simulations, we show that the IISM noise models can result in the apparent measurement of strong frequency dependence of scattering variations observed in the MPTA data set. Our analysis shows that improvements in the IISM noise modelling techniques are necessary to accurately measure the IISM properties.

## 9. Electromagnetic variability from circumbinary discs around binary black holes during their post-decoupling epoch

**Abstract**: Electromagnetic variability from circumbinary discs around binary black holes during their post-decoupling epoch Raphaël Mignon-Risse, Peggy Varniere, Fabien Casse 9 pages, 7 figures. Accepted for publication in MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present general-relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of inviscid circumbinary discs (CBDs) around near equal-mass binary black holes (BBH) in the binary-disc post-decoupling epoch. We use an approximate BBH spacetime with a post-Newtonian inspiral motion trajectory from ${\sim}80 (M/10^7 \mathrm{M_\odot}) \, \mbox{days}$ (separation of ${\sim}\,30$ gravitational radii) to ${\sim}100 (M/10^7 \mathrm{M_\odot}) \, \mbox{minutes}$ before merger. Initial data for the inspiral runs are produced from circular-orbits runs covering the formation timescale of the overdense {\lq}lump{\rq}, orbiting the CBD inner edge. The CBD non-axisymmetries (spiral waves and lump) lead to non-negligible angular momentum transport with effective viscosity ${\alpha_\mathrm{eff} \, {\sim} \, 10^{-3}{- 2\times 10}^{-2}}$. We post-process these simulations with a general-relativistic ray-tracing code to obtain synthetic observations in thermal emission. We find the lump and its associated electromagnetic (EM) modulation, already reported in the pre-decoupling epoch, to survive post-decoupling up until the end of the simulation. For LISA sources, our findings point to an active EM signature in UV during optimal gravitational wave source localization. For PTA sources and current BBH candidates detected through their optical periodicity: the lump{ in a low-viscosity CBD is a possible, though not unique, origin} for the observed periodicity.

## 10. Measuring accretion disc properties in the transitional millisecond pulsar PSR J1023+0038 using XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, NICER and Chandra

**Abstract**: Measuring accretion disc properties in the transitional millisecond pulsar PSR J1023+0038 using XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, NICER and Chandra Vishal Jadoliya (IIT Hyderabad, India), Mayukh Pahari (IIT Hyderabad, India), Sudip Bhattacharyya (TIFR, India and MIT, USA), Shaswat Suresh Nair (IISER-Pune, India) 18 pages, 3 tables, 12 figures, Accepted for publication in the Journal of High Energy Astrophysics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Whether the accretion disc in the X-ray high-mode of transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSP) reaches near the neutron star surface by penetrating the magnetosphere is a crucial question with many implications, including for continuous gravitational wave emission from the pulsar. We attempt to answer this question for the tMSP PSR J1023+0038 by segregating high-mode data and performing detailed spectral analysis using the XMM-Newton EPIC-PN+MOS1+MOS2 joint observations, XMM-Newton+NuSTAR joint observations, NICER and Chandra individual observations during different epochs. With the sum of longest exposures ($\sim$202 ksec of high mode data from $\sim$364 ksec of total exposure), we performed a self-consistent spectral analysis and constrain the inner disc radius 16.8 $\pm$ 3.8 km with at least 3$\sigma$ significance. Such a measurement is found consistent with best-fit spectral values of inner disc radius from other observatory like NICER and a joint observations with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR within 3$\sigma$ limits. We also detect a Fe emission line at 6.45 keV, for the first time from a tMSP, in the Chandra spectrum with 99% significance with an upper limit of the inner disc radius of 21 R$_g$, supporting independently the fact that inner disc extends into neutron stars's magnetosphere during high mode. All results from our analysis imply that the accretion disc is significantly present and extended within the corotation radius of the neutron star in PSR J1023+0038 during the X-ray high-mode of the tMSP PSR J1023+0038. The measured range of inner disc radius is fully consistent with an independent analysis by Bhattacharyya (2020), which suggests continuous gravitational wave emission from this neutron star, and the standard model of X-ray pulsations in accreting MSPs.

## 11. Echoes of the First Stars: Massive Star Evolution in Extremely Metal-Poor Environments with the Habitable Worlds Observatory

**Abstract**: Echoes of the First Stars: Massive Star Evolution in Extremely Metal-Poor Environments with the Habitable Worlds Observatory Peter Senchyna, Calum Hawcroft, Miriam Garcia, Aida Wofford, Janice C. Lee, Chris Evans 16 pages, 5 figures; HWO science case adapted and submitted as part of the proceedings of HWO25: "Towards the Habitable Worlds Observatory: Visionary Science and Transformational Technology" (ASP Conference Series) Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) A remarkable span of frontier astrophysics, from gravitational-wave archaeology to the origin of the elements to interpreting snapshots of the earliest galaxies, depends sensitively on our understanding of massive star formation and evolution in near-pristine, relatively enriched gas. From the surprisingly massive black holes detected by LIGO/Virgo to highly ionized nebulae with peculiar enrichment patterns observed in galaxies at Cosmic Dawn, evidence is mounting that our understanding of massive-star populations at very low metallicity remains critically incomplete. The fundamental limitation is the hand nature has dealt us: only a few star-forming galaxies within $\lesssim$1 Mpc can currently be resolved into individual stars, and none reach the extreme metallicities and star-formation intensities that characterized the early Universe. With an ultraviolet integral-field spectrograph aboard the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), this barrier will finally be broken. HWO will bring rare, actively star-forming, extremely metal-poor dwarf galaxies at $\sim$10-20 Mpc such as I Zw 18 within reach of resolved UV-optical spectroscopy, providing our first direct, statistical view of individual massive stars and the feedback they drive at $>$30 $M_\odot$ and $<$10% $Z_\odot$. This science is deeply synergistic with many next-generation facilities, yet requires the unique combination of spatial resolution and UV/optical sensitivity that only HWO can provide. The massive star science enabled by HWO within the Local Volume represents a transformational advance in our ability to probe the earliest stellar populations - those that seeded the Milky Way and other galaxies with the first heavy elements, and paved the way for life in the transparent, reionized Universe we inhabit today.
