## 1. Rapid inference of gravitational-wave signals in the time domain using a heterodyned likelihood

**Abstract**: Rapid inference of gravitational-wave signals in the time domain using a heterodyned likelihood Neha Sharma, Aditya Vijaykumar, Prayush Kumar General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Parameter estimation of gravitational wave signals is computationally intensive and typically requires millions of likelihood evaluations to construct posterior probability distributions. This computational cost increases significantly in the time domain, which requires non-diagonal covariance matrices to compute the likelihood. Consequently, parameter estimation of long-duration gravitational wave signals, such as binary neutron star mergers, becomes computationally infeasible in time domain. In this work, we detail a framework for the heterodyned likelihood that enables rapid inference in the time domain. Our method is applicable to signals with arbitrary mode content, and leverages the smoothness of the ratio of complex-valued waveform modes, approximating the ratio as a linear function within appropriately chosen time bins. This allows downsampling of the waveform modes and a reformulation of the likelihood, such that it depends only on the bin edges. We demonstrate that this likelihood recovers posteriors that are indistinguishable from those obtained using the standard likelihood in the time domain. We also observe dramatic improvement in speed - for a 128 seconds-long gravitational wave signal, our method is at least $\sim 400$ times faster than the standard time-domain analysis, reducing the wall clock time to just a few hours. We also demonstrate the reliability and unbiasedness of the likelihood using percentile-percentile tests for binary black hole and binary neutron star injections. We use the Gohberg-Semencul representation of the inverse of Toeplitz covariance matrix to accelerate matrix-vector products, which has potential applications even in non heterodyned time-domain inference.

**Abstract**: Source-Driven Tails in Kerr Spacetime: Nonlinear effects in Late-Time Behavior Som Dev Bishoyi, Subir Sabharwal, Gaurav Khanna 7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, comments and feedback are welcome General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We present the long-duration time-domain simulations of scalar-field tails in Kerr spacetimes driven by \emph{outgoing} multipolar sources. Extending the recent work in the literature from Schwarzschild to rotating black holes, we evolve sources with $\ell'=\{0,1,2,3,4\}$ on backgrounds with dimensionless spin $a/M=\{0.0, 0.8, 1.0\}$ and extract the late-time decay rates of measured modes $\ell\le4$ for a nonlinearity-inspired outgoing source with a $1/r^2$ fall-off. In all cases we find the inverse power-law index $p_{\ell\ell'}$ to be larger than the source-free Price law values by one unit, i.e. $p^{\text{sourced}}_{\ell\ell'} = p^{\text{Price}}_{\ell\ell'} + 1$. We also include a power-law index value computation for a similar source-driven gravitational wave case $(\ell,m)=(4,4)$ and confirm closely related results in the recent literature.

**Abstract**: Narrowing Down Sources of High-Frequency Gravitational Waves Asher Berlin, Dawid Brzeminski, Erwin H. Tanin High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex) Detecting gravitational waves above 100 kHz would constitute a major discovery, as any observable signal would have to arise from new physics within the late universe. Although many technologies have been identified to explore this high-frequency regime, the known landscape of promising sources remains extremely sparse. In this work, we aim to rectify this issue by providing model-independent arguments that highlight the most interesting parts of theory space, while remaining agnostic of the specific signal mechanism. For example, energy-conservation implies that gravitational waves detectable by future experiments well above a MHz would most likely have to originate from within the Solar System. Based on these arguments, we also constrain the physical properties of such sources.

## 4. Constraining the inflaton potential with gravitational waves from oscillons

**Abstract**: Constraining the inflaton potential with gravitational waves from oscillons Kaloian D. Lozanov, Misao Sasaki, Jan Tränkle 11 pages + appendices, 5 figures Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Under certain conditions, the oscillating inflaton condensate filling the Universe after inflation can fragment and form so-called oscillons. These long-lived soliton-like field configurations can dominate the Universe for several $e$-folds of expansion, leading to an early matter-dominated phase preceding the standard radiation era. In this paper we show how the rapid final decay of the oscillons leads to an enhanced production of induced gravitational waves, whose energy density can saturate the observational bound on the effective number of relativistic species. We leverage this bound to constrain the inflaton mass, cubic, and quartic self-coupling in generic models that admit oscillon formation, providing novel and complementary constraints in regions of parameter space that are inaccessible with cosmic microwave background observations alone.

**Abstract**: Time delay interferometry with minimal null frequencies and shortened time span Gang Wang 18 pages, 11 figures, a follow-up to the works arXiv:2403.01490 and arXiv:2406.11305 Sci. China Phys. Mech. Astron. 69, 220411 (2026) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Time-delay interferometry (TDI) is essential for suppressing laser frequency noise in space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatories such as LISA. However, current second-generation TDI schemes often exhibit undesirable null frequencies and require long delay spans, which can impair data analysis performance. In this work, we introduce an alternative TDI configuration PD4L designed to minimize null frequencies and operate with a shorter effective time span. Constructed by synthesizing two distinct first-generation TDI schemes, PD4L achieves a delay span of 4$L$ (where $L$ is the arm length), half that of the standard Michelson and hybrid Relay configurations. We assess PD4L's performance by evaluating the spectral stability of instrumental noise via arm-length derivatives, simulating chirping GW signals from coalescing massive black hole binaries, and comparing waveform responses. Parameter estimation is performed in the frequency domain, and noise characterization is examined under realistic orbital dynamics. As demonstrated by the comparisons, the compact structure of PD4L offers several advantages: (1) reduced data margins at segment boundaries, (2) mitigated aliasing effects in the high-frequency regime, and (3) shortened signal tails arising from extended delay spans. Additionally, PD4L's null channels exhibit the same minimal null frequencies as its science channels, while maintaining greater spectral stability than other null streams. Overall, PD4L improves parameter estimation accuracy at high frequencies and supports reliable noise characterization over observation periods of up to four months. These results highlight PD4L as a compact and effective alternative for future TDI implementations, especially in high-frequency GW data analysis for LISA-like missions.

## 6. Challenging a binary neutron star merger interpretation of GW230529

**Abstract**: Challenging a binary neutron star merger interpretation of GW230529 Ivan Markin, Anna Puecher, Mattia Bulla, Tim Dietrich Phys.Rev.D 113 (2026) 2, 024031 General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) GW230529_181500 represented the first gravitational-wave detection with one of the component objects' mass inferred to lie in the previously hypothesized mass gap between the heaviest neutron stars and the lightest observed black holes. Given the expected maximum mass values for neutron stars, this object was identified as a black hole, and, with the secondary component being a neutron star, the detection was classified as a neutron star-black hole merger. However, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the known waveform degeneracy between the spin and mass ratio in the employed gravitational-wave models, GW230529_181500 could also be interpreted as a merger of two heavy ($\gtrsim 2 \mathrm{M}_\odot$) neutron stars with high spins. We investigate the distinguishability of these scenarios by performing parameter estimation on simulated signals obtained from numerical-relativity waveforms for both neutron star-black hole and binary neutron star systems, with parameters consistent with GW230529_181500, and comparing them to the analysis of the real event data. We find that GW230529_181500 is more likely to have originated from a neutron star-black hole merger, though the possibility of a binary neutron star origin can not be ruled out. Moreover, we use the simulation data to estimate the signatures of potential electromagnetic counterparts emitted by the systems. We find them to be too dim to be located by current wide-field surveys if only the dynamical ejecta is considered, and detectable by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory during the first two days after merger if one accounts for additional disk wind ejecta.

To enhance sensitivity to this targeted population, we incorporate a redshift-corrected population model informed by radio observations of Galactic double neutron star systems. The search identifies a significant trigger with a false-alarm rate of one per fifty years and a network signal-to-noise ratio of 9.7. This trigger was first reported in low-latency processing as S231109ci and subsequently listed in the GWTC-4.0 catalog as GW231109_235456, a subthreshold candidate. Accounting for a trials factor of five arising from four previous searches in GWTC-4.0 and this new search, the false-alarm rate of the candidate is approximately one per ten years. If the event is of astrophysical origin, the inferred source properties indicate component masses of 1.40 to 2.24 solar masses for the primary and 0.97 to 1.49 solar masses for the secondary, yielding a total mass of 2.95 solar masses with an uncertainty of plus 0.38 and minus 0.07 solar masses. The event is localized to a region of 450 square degrees enclosing ninety percent probability at a luminosity distance of 165 megaparsecs with an uncertainty of plus 70 and minus 69 megaparsecs. Assuming the signal arises from a binary neutron star merger, we estimate the local merger rate to lie between 53 and 342 per cubic gigaparsec per year.

## 8. The steep redshift evolution of the hierarchical binary black hole merger rate may cause the $z$-$χ_{\rm eff}$ correlation

Also see Vijaykumar et al., posted simultaneously. v2 updates references and corrects a plotting error High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) There is growing evidence from gravitational-wave observations that some merging black holes are created from previous mergers. Using the prediction that these hierarchically-merged black holes have dimensionless spin magnitudes of $\chi \approx 0.69$, we identify a subpopulation in the gravitational-wave data consistent with a hierarchical-merger origin in dense star clusters. This subpopulation's primary mass distribution peaks at $16.7^{+3.1}_{-4.6},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, which is approximately twice as large as its secondary mass distribution's mode ($8.0^{+29.7}_{-2.3},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), and its spin tilt distribution is consistent with isotropy. Our inferred secondary mass distributions imply that isolated binary evolution may still be needed to explain the entirety of the $9\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak. Surprisingly, we find that the rate of hierarchical mergers may evolve more steeply with redshift than the rest of the population ($98.5\%$ credibility): the fraction of all binary black holes that are hierarchically formed at $z=0.1$ is $0.05^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$, compared to $0.17^{+0.13}_{-0.12}$ at $z=1$. This provides an explanation for the previously-discovered broadening of the effective spin distribution with redshift. Our results have implications for star cluster formation histories, as they suggest the potential existence of a high-redshift population of massive, compact clusters.

Medinaceli 17 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables, including appendices Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Weak lensing surveys require accurate correction for the point spread function (PSF) when measuring galaxy shapes. For a diffraction-limited PSF, as arises in space-based missions, this correction depends on each galaxy SED. In the Euclid mission, galaxy SED reconstruction, a tasks of the photometric-redshift processing function (PHZ PF), relies on broad- and medium-band ancillary photometry. The limited wavelength sampling of the Euclid VIS passband and signal-to-noise ratio may affect the reconstruction accuracy and translate into biases in the weak lensing measurements. In this study, we present the methodology, which is employed in the Euclid PHZ PF, for reconstructing galaxy SEDs at 55 wavelengths, sampling the VIS passband every 10 nm, and we assess whether it fulfils the accuracy requirements imposed on the Euclid PSF model. We employ both physics- and data-driven methods, focusing on a new approach of template-based flux correction and Gaussian processes, and we introduce an SED metric whose bias propagates into PSF quadrupole moment errors. Our findings demonstrate that Gaussian processes and template fitting meet the requirements only in specific, but complementary, redshift intervals. We therefore propose a hybrid approach, which leverages both methods. This solution proves to be effective in meeting the Euclid accuracy requirements for most of the redshift range of the survey. Finally, we investigate the impact on the SED reconstruction of a new set of 16 evenly-spaced medium-band filters for the Subaru telescope, providing quasi-spectroscopic coverage of the VIS passband. This study shows promising results, ensuring accurate SED reconstruction and meeting the mission PSF requirements. This work thus provides not only the methodological foundation of galaxy SED reconstruction in the Euclid PHZ PF, but also a roadmap for future improvements using a new medium-band survey.

**Abstract**: The gravitational wave landscape of cosmic string networks with varying tension Luca Brunelli, Filippo Revello, Gonzalo Villa High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We fully classify the phenomenology of gravitational wave emission from scaling cosmic string networks with varying tension and compute the spectral indices of the resulting stochastic backgrounds. In string compactifications, periods of varying tension occur when moduli acquire a time-dependence. We present concrete examples in type IIB string theory as D3- and NS5- branes wrapping internal cycles, which become dynamical due to the effect of moduli potentials. Moreover, we use Swampland constraints to derive general bounds on the allowed time-variation of the effective string tension in FLRW backgrounds and on the resulting spectral indices.

## 11. Circumbinary disks in post common envelope binary systems with compact objects

**Abstract**: Circumbinary disks in post common envelope binary systems with compact objects Lotem Unger, Aldana Grichener, Noam Soker 15 pages, 7 figures. Accepted for publication in ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We conduct a population synthesis study using the binary population synthesis code compas to explore the formation of circumbinary disks (CBDs) following the common envelope evolution (CEE) phase of a giant star and a neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH). We focus on massive binary systems that evolve into double compact object (DCO) binaries after the exposed core of the giant collapses to form a second NS or BH. A CBD around the binary system of the giant's core and the compact object alters the orbital evolution of the binary. We parameterize the conditions for CBD formation in post-CEE binaries and present characteristics of DCO progenitors that are likely or unlikely to form CBDs. We find that CBD formation is most common in BH-BH binaries and NS-NS binaries that are expected to merge within Hubble time. Furthermore, we find that the interaction of the CBD with the core - NS/BH system at the termination of the CEE reduces the expected rate of DCO mergers, regardless of whether these binaries tighten or expand due to this interaction. If the binary system loses angular momentum to the CBD, it may produce a luminous transient due to a merger between the NS/BH and the core of the giant rather than gravitational wave sources. Thus, accounting for post-CEE CBD formation and its interaction with the binary system in population synthesis studies is significant for obtaining reliable predictions of the gravitational wave event rates expected by current detectors.

## 12. Zero-Shot Detection of Elastic Transient Morphology Across Physical Systems

**Abstract**: Zero-Shot Detection of Elastic Transient Morphology Across Physical Systems Jose Sánchez Andreu 17 pages, 6 figures. Supplemental material included Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an) We test whether a representation learned from interferometric strain transients in gravitational-wave observatories can act as a frozen morphology-sensitive operator for unseen sensors, provided the target signals preserve coherent elastic transient structure. Using a neural encoder trained exclusively on non-Gaussian instrumental glitches, we perform strict zero-shot anomaly analysis on rolling-element bearings without retraining, fine-tuning, or target-domain labels. On the IMS-NASA run-to-failure dataset, the operator yields a monotonic health index HI(t) = s0.99(t)/tau normalized to an early-life reference distribution, enabling fixed false-alarm monitoring at 1-q = 1e-3 with tau = Q0.999(P0). In discrete fault regimes (CWRU), it achieves strong window-level discrimination (AUC_win about 0.90) and file-level separability approaching unity (AUC_file about 0.99). Electrically dominated vibration signals (VSB) show weak, non-selective behavior, delineating a physical boundary for transfer. Under a matched IMS controlled-split protocol, a generic EfficientNet-B0 encoder pretrained on ImageNet collapses in the intermittent regime (Lambda_tail about 2), while the interferometric operator retains strong extreme-event selectivity (Lambda_tail about 860), indicating that the effect is not a generic property of CNN features. Controlled morphology-destruction transformations selectively degrade performance despite per-window normalization, consistent with sensitivity to coherent time-frequency organization rather than marginal amplitude statistics.
