**Abstract**: Theory-agnostic searches of non-gravitational modes in the ringdown Francesco Crescimbeni Contribution to: 24th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation (GR24) and 16th Edoardo Amaldi Conference on Gravitational Waves (Amaldi16) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a theory-agnostic framework to search for extra-fundamental modes in the ringdown phase of black hole mergers. These modes, distinct from standard General Relativity (GR) deviations, originate from modifications of the theory of gravity. Applying our method to the events GW150914, GW190521, and GW200129, we find no significant evidence for extra modes beyond those expected in GR.

**Abstract**: Constraining the gravitational-wave emission of core-collapse supernovae with ground-based detectors Jingwang Diao, Xingjiang Zhu General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) A gravitational-wave background (GWB) arising from the superposition of numerous unresolved gravitational-wave signals has yet to be detected. Potential contributing sources to such a background include compact binary coalescences (CBCs) and core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). In this work, we place upper limits on the gravitational-wave energy emitted by CCSNe using cross-correlation measurements made with Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors during their third observing run (O3). Specifically, we obtain a $95\%$ credibility upper limit of $0.01~ {M_\odot c^2}$ while accounting for the contribution from CBC sources to a GWB. This result improves on previous constraint obtained from initial LIGO data by approximately two orders of magnitude. We also explore the detection prospects of third-generation ground-based detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer for both individual CCSNe events and the GWB. Our results show that single events are likely to be detected prior to the GWB.

**Abstract**: On finding gravitational waves from anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background Yiran Wang General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP) The integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect describes how photons are gravitationally redshifted, producing anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background. We study the inverse problem and show that primordial gravitational perturbations, in particular their polarizations in the transversally traceless (TT) gauge can be identified from the local observation of the ISW effect.

**Abstract**: Gravitational waveforms from periodic orbits around a charged black hole with scalar hair Weike Deng, Sheng Long, Qin Tan, Jiliang Jing General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate geodesic motion and gravitational-wave signatures of charged black holes with scalar hair. Using the effective potential approach, we analyze marginally bound orbits and innermost stable circular orbits, showing how their positions and energy thresholds are modified by the scalar hair parameter $r_B$. These results demonstrate scalar hair's role in altering the boundary of stable motion. We further explore periodic orbits characterized by rational frequency ratios, labeled by the index $(z,w,v)$, and quantify how scalar hair affects their orbital energy and angular momentum. Based on these orbital properties, we compute gravitational waveforms from extreme mass-ratio inspirals where a stellar-mass compact object orbits a supermassive charged black hole with scalar hair. Using the numerical kludge method, we generate waveforms that exhibit clear zoom-whirl patterns with morphology visibly affected by $r_B$. Our results show that scalar hair leaves distinguishable imprints on waveforms, suggesting future space-based detectors could probe deviations from classical black hole spacetimes through extreme mass-ratio inspirals observations.

**Abstract**: PETRA: From the LISA global fit to a catalog of Galactic binaries Aaron D. Johnson, Javier Roulet, Katerina Chatziioannou, Michele Vallisneri, Chris G. Trejo, Kyle A. Gersbach Phys. Rev. D 112, 024045 (2025) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect mHz gravitational waves from many astrophysical sources, including millions of compact binaries in the Galaxy, thousands of which may be individually resolvable. The large number of signals overlapping in the LISA dataset requires a \emph{global fit} in which an unknown number of sources are modeled simultaneously. This introduces a \emph{label-switching ambiguity} for sources in the same class, making it challenging to distill a traditional astronomical catalog from global-fit posteriors. We present a method to construct a catalog by post-processing the global-fit posterior, relabeling samples to minimize the statistical divergence between the global fit and a factorized catalog representation. The resulting catalog consists of the source posterior distributions and their probabilities of having an astrophysical origin. We demonstrate our algorithm on two toy models and on a small simulated LISA dataset of Galactic binaries. Our method is implemented in the open-source Python package \textsc{petra\_catalogs}, and it can be applied in postprocessing to the output of any global-fit sampler.

LIGO Document Number: P2500106 General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Detection of quasi-monochromatic, long-duration (continuous) gravitational wave radiation emitted by, e.g., asymmetric rotating neutron stars in our Galaxy requires a long observation time to distinguish it from the detector's noise. If this signal is additionally microlensed by a lensing object located in the Galaxy, its magnitude would be temporarily magnified, which may lead to its discovery and allow probing of the physical nature of the lensing object and the source. We study the observational effect of microlensing of continuous gravitational wave signals for Galactic sources and lenses in the point mass lens approximation. In particular, we examine the regions of the parameter space that are promising for lensed CW searches, and perform example simulations to demonstrate how the lensing effect affects the continuous-wave signal. We show that an analytical lensing pattern can be identified from the lensed continuous wave signal using the Time-Domain F-statistic search, as the estimated signal-to-noise ratio in each time-domain segment scales directly with the amplification factor.

**Abstract**: On the observation of cosmic strings via gravitational-wave lensing Oleg Bulashenko, Nino Villanueva, Roberto Bada Nerin, Jos√© A. Font 20 pages, 10 figs, table III and Fig.9 updated General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a framework for detecting gravitational-wave signals lensed by cosmic strings (CSs), addressing a key gap in current searches. CSs, whose detection would provide a unique probe of high-energy physics and the early Universe, possess distinct topological and geometric features that require a dedicated search strategy. Our approach employs a full-wave transmission factor, expressed analytically via Fresnel integrals, which captures the characteristic diffraction and interference effects of the conical spacetime around a straight CS. We contrast CS lensing with the well-studied point mass lens (PML) model, highlighting their fundamental differences: CS lensing depends on cosmological distances, string tension $\Delta$, and wavelength $\lambda$, and produces two non-amplified images set by the global conical geometry. In contrast, PML lensing is governed by the distance-independent ratio $\sim M_{Lz}/\lambda$, where $M_{Lz}$ represents the redshifted mass of the lens, with image properties derived from the lens equation. For BBH mergers lensed by CSs, we show that the waveforms exhibit a characteristic beating pattern or time-separated, exact replicas. We derive a detectability bound on the string tension and, using Bayesian model selection, demonstrate that CS lensing is distinguishable from both unlensed and PML-lensed signals across a wide region of parameter space.

**Abstract**: A Hubble constant estimation with dark standard sirens and galaxy cluster catalogues Freija Beirnaert, Archisman Ghosh, Gergely D√°lya Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this paper, we explore the possibility of using galaxy cluster catalogues to provide redshift support for a gravitational-wave dark standard siren measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0$. We adapt the cosmology inference pipeline gwcosmo to handle galaxy cluster catalogues. Together with binary black holes from the GWTC-3, we use galaxy cluster data from the PSZ2 and the eRASS catalogues. With these catalogues, we obtain $H_0 = 77^{+10}_{-10}$ and $81^{+8}_{-8}\, \text{km}\, \text{s}^{-1}\, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$ respectively, which demonstrates improvements on precision by factors of 10% and 38% respectively over the traditional galaxy catalogue result. This exploratory work paves the way towards precise and accurate cosmography making use of distant compact binary mergers from upcoming observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network and future gravitational-wave observatories.

## 9. Prospects for searching for sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy cosmologies using joint observations of gravitational waves and $Œ≥$-ray bursts

**Abstract**: Prospects for searching for sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy cosmologies using joint observations of gravitational waves and $Œ≥$-ray bursts Lu Feng, Tao Han, Jing-Fei Zhang, Xin Zhang Chinese Physics C 50 (2026) 015105 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) In the era of third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, GW standard siren observations from binary neutron star mergers provide a powerful tool for probing the expansion history of the universe. Since sterile neutrinos can influence cosmic evolution by modifying the radiation content and suppressing structure formation, GW standard sirens offer promising prospects for constraining sterile neutrino properties within a cosmological framework. Building on this, we investigate the prospects for detecting sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy (DE) models using joint observations from 3G GW detectors and a future short gamma-ray burst detector, such as a THESEUS-like telescope. We consider three DE models: the $w$CDM, holographic DE (HDE), and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) models. Our results show that the properties of DE can influence the constraints on sterile neutrino parameters. Moreover, the inclusion of GW data significantly improves constraints on both sterile neutrino parameters and other cosmological parameters across all three models, compared to the current limits derived from CMB+BAO+SN (CBS) observations. When GW data are included into the CBS dataset, a preference for $\Delta N_{\rm eff} > 0$ emerges at approximately the $1\sigma$ level in the $w$CDM and CPL models, and reaches about $3\sigma$ in the HDE model. Moreover, the upper limits on $m_{\nu,{\rm sterile}}^{\rm eff}$ are reduced by approximately 13%, 75%, and 3% in the $w$CDM, HDE, and CPL models, respectively.

## 10. Reexamining Evidence of a Pair-Instability Mass Gap in the Binary Black Hole Population

**Abstract**: Reexamining Evidence of a Pair-Instability Mass Gap in the Binary Black Hole Population Anarya Ray, Vicky Kalogera High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The fourth gravitational wave transient catalog~(GWTC-4) has enabled empirical probes of the theorized pair-instability gap in the higher end of the binary black hole~(BBH) mass-spectrum. In this letter, using flexibly parametrized models, we show that at present there is no evidence of a sharp drop-off in the spectrum of black hole masses near $~40-50M_{\odot}$. We simultaneously characterize the transition in the distribution of BBH mass-ratios, effective aligned and effective precessing spins using our flexible models. From the transitions in our inferred spin and mass-ratio distributions, we find that the high-mass broad-spin sub-population has a significant fraction~($52^{+18}_{-23}\%$) of systems with mass ratios in the range $0.6-1$. This suggests that alternatives to the hypothesis of 2G+1G hierarchical systems dominating BBH formation above $\sim 40-50 M_{\odot}$ are more consistent with the GWTC-4 detection sample. By comparing with the predictions of star cluster simulations, we further show that contributions from (2G+2G) systems are not abundant enough to alleviate this discrepancy. We also demonstrate the effects of strong model assumptions on this inference, which can lead to biased astrophysical interpretation from restricted priors. We note that our results do not exclude that a high-mass gap may be identified as our sample size increases. We constrain the lower bound on the location of a possible PISN cutoff still allowed within measurement uncertainties to be $(57^{+17}_{-10}M_{\odot})$ and discuss its implications on the S factor of $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16}O$ at 300 kev.

**Abstract**: Glimpsing Physics of Nano-Hz Gravitational Waves in Neutrinos from Core-Collapse Supernovae Hooman Davoudiasl, Peter B. Denton, Anna M. Suliga 8 pages, 2 figures. Comments are welcome! High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The growing evidence for nano-hertz gravitational waves, from NANOGrav and other observations, may be pointing to a cosmological first-order phase transition at temperatures of $\mathcal{O}(10-100)\;\mathrm{MeV}$. Such an interpretation requires dynamics beyond the Standard Model in this energy range. If so, it may well be the case that core-collapse supernova explosions would recreate the first-order phase transition leaving a unique imprint on the spectrum of neutrinos emitted in the initial few seconds. This scenario is also suggestive of a low-mass seesaw mechanism to explain neutrino masses. We outline the prospects for future observations of Galactic supernovae to uncover the signals of this scenario, which could get further confirmation with additional pulsar timing array data establishing the primordial origin of the observed nano-hertz gravitational waves.

## 12. String Decomposition and Gravitational Waves in High-quality Axion Gauge Theories

**Abstract**: String Decomposition and Gravitational Waves in High-quality Axion Gauge Theories Camilla Mupo, Yue Zhang High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The QCD axion can successfully solve the strong CP problem under the condition that the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is respected to extremely high standard. We explore a class of gauge theories that accommodate a high-quality axion, known as the Barr-Seckel models, paying special attention to the cosmology of topological defects. In models with domain wall number equal to unity, we show that axion strings with winding number larger than one can always be decomposed into a number of unit-winding axion strings and pure gauge strings. This mechanism enables the axion string-wall network to be destroyed timely to render a viable cosmology. The subsequent decay of gauge strings into gravitational waves generically produces a double-plateau in frequency space allowing the mechanism to be tested by upcoming experiments.

An optical transient, AT2025ulz, was discovered within the localization region. AT2025ulz initially appeared to meet the expected behavior of kilonova (KN) emission, the telltale signature of a binary neutron star merger. The transient subsequently rebrightened after $\sim$\,$5$ days and developed spectral features characteristic of a Type IIb supernova. In this work, we analyze the observations of the host galaxy of AT2025ulz obtained by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). From the DESI spectrum, we obtain a secure redshift of $z = 0.084840 \pm 0.000006$, which places the transient within $2\sigma$ of the gravitational wave distance and results in an integral overlap between the gravitational wave alert and the transient location of $\log_{10}\mathcal{I} \approx 3.9-4.2$. Our analysis of the host galaxy's spectral energy distribution reveals a star-forming, dusty galaxy with stellar mass ${\sim} 10^{10}~M_\odot$, broadly consistent with the population of both short gamma-ray bursts and core-collapse supernova host galaxies. We also present our follow-up of DESI-selected candidate host galaxies using the Fraunhofer Telescope at the Wendelstein Observatory, and show the promise of DESI for associating or rejecting candidate electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave alerts. These results emphasize the value of DESI's extensive spectroscopic dataset in rapidly characterizing host galaxies, enabling spectroscopic host subtraction, and guiding targeted follow-up.

## 14. Continuous gravitational waves from magnetized white dwarfs: Quantifying the detection plausibility by LISA

**Abstract**: Continuous gravitational waves from magnetized white dwarfs: Quantifying the detection plausibility by LISA Mayusree Das (IISc), Banibrata Mukhopadhyay (IISc), Tomasz Bulik (U. Warsaw) 16 pages including 14 figures and 1 table; accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) White dwarfs (WDs) are frequently observed to have strong magnetic fields up to $10^9$ G and expected to have a possible internal field as high as $\sim 10^{14}$ G. High internal fields can significantly deform a WD's equilibrium structure, generating a quadrupole moment. If the rotation axis is misaligned with the magnetic axis, the deformation can lead to the emission of continuous gravitational waves (CGWs). We examine the potential for detecting CGWs from magnetized WDs with future space-based detectors such as LISA, ALIA, DECIGO, Deci-Hz, BBO and TianQin. We model the field-induced deformation and compute the resulting GW strain, incorporating amplitude decay due to angular momentum loss from electromagnetic and gravitational radiation. This sets a timescale for detection -`active timescale' of $10^{5-6}$ yr, requiring observation while the object remains sufficiently young. Our results suggest that LISA could detect a few dozens of highly magnetized WDs across the Galaxy during its mission. As a specific case, we investigate ZTF J1901+1458- a compact, massive, fast-rotating, and strongly magnetized WD with spin period $\sim416$ s and inferred surface field $\sim10^{9}$ G. We find that this object would be detectable by LISA with four years of continuous data. This highlights the potential of CGW observations to probe magnetic field structure in WDs and their role in type Ia supernova progenitors.

Hall, Ariel Amsellem, Rosa L. Becerra, Malte Busmann, Tomas Cabrera, Simone Dichiara, Lei Hu, Ravjit Kaur, Keerthi Kunnumkai, Ignacio Magana Hernandez Accepted for publication in ApJL on 10/22/2025 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The first joint electromagentic (EM) and gravitational wave (GW) detection, known as GW170817, marked a critical juncture in our collective understanding of compact object mergers. However, it has now been 8 years since this discovery, and the search for a second EM-GW detection has yielded no robust discoveries. Recently, on August 18, 2025, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration reported a low-significance (high false alarm rate) binary neutron star merger candidate S250818k. Rapid optical follow-up revealed a single optical candidate AT2025ulz ($z=0.08484$) that initially appeared consistent with kilonova emission. We quickly initiated a set of observations with \textit{Swift}, \textit{XMM-Newton}, \textit{Chandra}, and the Very Large Array to search for non-thermal afterglow emission. Our deep X-ray and radio search rules out that the optical rebrightening of AT2025ulz is related to the afterglow onset, reinforcing its classification as a stripped-envelope supernova (SN 2025ulz). We derive constraints on the afterglow parameters for a hypothetical binary neutron star merger at the distance of AT2025ulz ($\approx 400$ Mpc) based on our X-ray and radio limits. We conclude that our observational campaign could exclude a GW170817-like afterglow out to viewing angles of $\theta_\textrm{v}\approx 12.5$ degrees. We briefly discuss the prospects for the future discovery of off-axis afterglows.

If astrophysical, this event would have a surprisingly low chirp mass, suggesting that at least one neutron star was below a solar mass. The Zwicky Transient Facility mapped the coarse localization and discovered a transient, ZTF25abjmnps (AT2025ulz), that was spatially and temporally coincident with the gravitational wave trigger. The first week of follow-up suggested properties reminiscent of a GW170817-like kilonova. Subsequent follow-up suggests properties most similar to a young, stripped-envelope, Type IIb supernova. Although we cannot statistically rule out chance coincidence, we undertake due diligence analysis to explore the possible association between ZTF25abjmnps and S250818k. Theoretical models have been proposed wherein sub-solar neutron star(s) may form (and subsequently merge) via accretion disk fragmentation or core fission inside a core-collapse supernova i.e. a ``superkilonova". Here, we qualitatively discuss our multi-wavelength dataset in the context of the superkilonova picture. Future higher significance gravitational wave detections of sub-solar neutron star mergers with extensive electromagnetic follow-up would conclusively resolve this tantalizing multi-messenger association.

H. Pang, Julian Sommer, Robert Stein, Constantin Tabor, Pablo Vega, Thibeau Wouters, Xiaoxiong Zuo High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Over the past LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA (LVK) observing runs, it has become increasingly clear that identifying the next electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational-wave (GW) neutron star mergers will likely be more challenging compared to the case of GW170817. The rarity of these GW events, and their electromagnetic counterparts, motivates rapid searches of any candidate binary neutron star (BNS) merger detected by the LVK. We present our extensive photometric and spectroscopic campaign of the candidate counterpart AT2025ulz to the low-significance GW event S250818k, which had a ${\sim} 29\%$ probability of being a BNS merger. We demonstrate that during the first five days, the luminosity and color evolution of AT2025ulz are consistent with both kilonova and shock cooling models, although a Bayesian model comparison shows preference for the shock cooling model, underscoring the ambiguity inherent to early data obtained over only a few days. Continued monitoring beyond this window reveals a rise and color evolution incompatible with kilonova models and instead consistent with a supernova. This event emphasizes the difficulty in identifying the electromagnetic counterparts to BNS mergers and the significant allotment of observing time necessary to robustly differentiate kilonovae from impostors.

## 18. Probing the nonstrange quark star equation of state with compact stars and gravitational waves

**Abstract**: Probing the nonstrange quark star equation of state with compact stars and gravitational waves Shu-Peng Wang, Zhen-Yan Lu, Zhi-Jun Ma, Rong-Yao Yang, Jian-Feng Xu, Xiangyun Fu High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th) A recent study shows that incorporating a new term into the thermodynamic potential density, as required by the thermodynamic consistency criterion, can effectively resolve the thermodynamic inconsistency problems of the conventional perturbative QCD model. This additional term plays a crucial role in resolving inconsistencies at relatively low densities and becomes negligible at extremely high densities. Within this revised perturbative QCD model, we find that if we require only that the energy per baryon of up-down ($ud$) quark matter exceeds 930 MeV so as not to contradict the standard nuclear physics, the maximum mass of an $ud$ quark star allowed by the revised perturbative QCD model can reach up to 2.17 $M_{\odot}$. From this perspective, the observed 2.14 $M_{\odot}$ pulsar PSR J0740+6620 may be an $ud$ quark star. However, if we further impose the constraint that the tidal deformability of a 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ $ud$ quark star must be consistent with the GW170817 event, the maximum mass allowed by the revised perturbative QCD model would decrease to no more than 2.08 $M_{\odot}$. Consequently, our results suggest that the compact object with a mass of 2.50-2.67 $M_{\odot}$, as observed in the GW190814 event, cannot be an $ud$ quark star, according to the revised perturbative QCD model.
