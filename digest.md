## 1. Testing the wormhole echo hypothesis for GW231123

**Abstract**: Testing the wormhole echo hypothesis for GW231123 Qi Lai, Qing-Yu Lan, Zhan-He Wang, Yun-Song Piao 17 pages, 3 figures and 2 tables General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) The short-duration gravitational-wave (GW) event GW231123 has inferred component masses in the pair-instability mass gap and exhibits a burst-like morphology with no clearly inspiral, making it an interesting target for tests beyond the standard binary black hole (BBH) interpretation. In this work, motivated by its phenomenological similarity to GW190521, we test whether GW231123 is compatible with a wormhole-echo scenario by modeling a leading echo pulse with a well-motivated phenomenological sine-Gaussian wavepacket. We perform Bayesian model comparison against a BBH baseline described by the IMRPhenomXPHM-SpinTaylor waveform, and obtain the Bayes factor ratio $\ln B^{\rm Echo}_{\rm BBH} = 1.87$, corresponding to weak-to-moderate support for the echo hypothesis. In our previous analysis for GW190521 within the same overall framework, we found $\ln B^{\rm Echo}_{\rm BBH} \approx -2.9$, implying a shift of $\Delta \ln B \approx 4.8$ between the two events. This sign change indicates that GW231123 is more compatible with a single-pulse echo description than GW190521.

**Abstract**: Model-Agnostic Population Inference for Gravitational-Wave Astronomy: From LIGO to LISA Yi-kun Li, Cheng Cheng, Lang Cui, Yun Fang Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Inferring the intrinsic population of compact binary mergers is complicated by detector selection biases and measurement uncertainties. Traditional parametric methods are limited by the need to presuppose functional forms, introducing model-dependent biases. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an inference framework powered by deep generative modeling. We develop a flexible, data-driven population model using a Correlated Compound-Mixture Density Network. This architecture integrates mixture models to handle multimodality, Gaussian copulas for parameter dependencies, and a library of flexible marginal distributions. The network is trained to approximate the posterior distribution of the population's hyperparameters using amortized variational inference with Normalizing Flows on catalogs of gravitational-wave events. We demonstrate the framework's capabilities in two distinct regimes. First, using simulated catalogs of supermassive black hole binary mergers for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), we show that the method accurately recovers complex three-dimensional distributions and absolute merger rates from sparse datasets, effectively correcting for selection effects and measurement uncertainties. Second, we validate the framework on real observational data from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA GWTC-3 catalog, successfully inferring the population of stellar-mass binary black holes using an injection-based selection effect correction. Our results confirm that the method is robust, scalable, and applicable across different detector sensitivities and source populations.

**Abstract**: An autoencoder-based surrogate waveform model for quasi-circular binary-black-hole mergers Anastasios Theodoropoulos, Nino Villanueva, Osvaldo Gramaxo Freitas, Tiago Fernandes, Solange Nunes, Alejandro Torres-Forne, Jose A. Font, Antonio Onofre, Jose D. Martin-Guerrero Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The generation of accurate waveforms from binary black hole (BBH) mergers is a major effort in Gravitational-Wave Astronomy. In recent years, machine-learning-based surrogate models for BBH waveforms have been proposed. Those offer the potential to dramatically accelerate waveform generation while maintaining accuracy competitive with that of traditional waveform approximants. In this work, we investigate the viability of autoencoders as generative models for gravitational-wave signals from quasi-circular BBH mergers. We introduce AESur3dq8, a novel surrogate waveform model based on autoencoders that enables the rapid and accurate construction of large template banks, producing millions of waveforms in under a second using modest computational resources. The model is trained on the numerical-relativity-informed surrogate NRHybSur3dq8 and subsequently fine-tuned using the SXS catalog of BBH simulations. We demonstrate that waveforms generated by AESur3dq8 achieve mismatches of order $10^{-4}$ with respect to Numerical Relativity waveforms, and that parameter estimation performed with these templates yields results fully consistent with those reported by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration for observed gravitational-wave events.

## 4. Running Love Numbers of Charged Black Holes

**Abstract**: Running Love Numbers of Charged Black Holes Sergio Barbosa, Sylvain Fichet, Lucas de Souza High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Loops of virtual particles from the vacuum of quantum field theory (QFT) render black holes tidally deformable. We compute the static tidal response of unspinning charged black holes at arbitrary radius, using the perturbative formalism developed in 2501.18684. Since the gravitational and electromagnetic tidal responses mix, we generalize the notion of Love numbers to Love matrices. We derive the coupled equations of motion for the metric and electromagnetic fluctuations around purely electric and magnetic backgrounds. For large charged black holes, which are described by the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of gravity, we compute the full set of Love matrices induced by an arbitrary tower of $F^{2n}$ operators. We find that, although quantum corrections break electromagnetic duality, the Love matrices in electric and magnetic backgrounds are related by a $Z_2$ symmetry under electric-magnetic exchange. Going beyond EFT, we compute the Love matrices of small magnetic black holes. We show that the running of the Love matrices is governed by the running of the $U(1)$ gauge coupling, and we derive the correspondence between Love and $U(1)$ beta functions for arbitrary harmonics. The overall picture that emerges is that the QFT-induced tidal response of magnetic black holes saturates in the strong-field regime. These results imply that nearly-extremal magnetic black holes charged under an Abelian dark sector could be probed by gravitational-wave observations.

**Abstract**: Nonperfect Carrollian Fluids Through Holography Felipe Diaz 10 pages. Contribution to the Proceedings of the conference Models in Quantum Field Theory (MQFT-2025) High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We embed the covariant, gauge-invariant gravitational radiation criteria of Fernández-Álvarez and Senovilla, based in terms of conformal geometry and the Bel-Robinson tensor, into the hydrodynamic framework of gauge/gravity duality. This construction uncovers a direct correspondence between bulk gravitational waves and dissipative processes in the boundary theory, from which a natural notion of entropy production emerges. We further analyze a smooth flat limit in which the dual fluid becomes Carrollian, with dissipation governed by Carroll-covariant tensors. As an example, we apply our framework to the Robinson-Trautman family of solutions.

## 6. Factorized neural posterior estimation for rapid and reliable inference of parameterized post-Einsteinian deviation parameters in gravitational waves

**Abstract**: Factorized neural posterior estimation for rapid and reliable inference of parameterized post-Einsteinian deviation parameters in gravitational waves Yong-Xin Zhang, Tian-Yang Sun, Chun-Yu Xiong, Song-Tao Liu, Yu-Xin Wang, Shang-Jie Jin, Jing-Fei Zhang, Xin Zhang Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) The direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) by LIGO has strikingly confirmed general relativity (GR), but testing GR via GWs requires estimating parameterized post-Einsteinian (ppE) deviation parameters in waveform models. Traditional Bayesian inference methods like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) provide reliable estimates but suffer from prohibitive computational costs, failing to meet the real-time demands and surging data volume of future GW detectors. Here, we propose a factorized neural posterior estimation framework: we construct independent normalizing flow models for each of the nine ppE deviation parameters and effectively integrate prior information from other source parameters via a conditional embedding network. Leveraging a hybrid neural network with a convolutional neural network and a Residual Neural Network for feature extraction, our method performs rapid and statistically reliable posterior inference directly from binary black hole signals. Compared to conventional MCMC, our approach achieves millisecond-scale inference time with a speedup factor of $9 \times 10^4$. Comprehensive validations show that the posterior estimates pass the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and achieve empirical coverage probabilities close to theoretical targets. This work demonstrates the great potential of deep learning for GW parameter estimation and provides a viable technical solution for real-time GR tests with next-generation detectors.

## 7. A novel Lagrange-multiplier approach to the effective-one-body dynamics of binary systems in post-Minkowskian gravity

**Abstract**: A novel Lagrange-multiplier approach to the effective-one-body dynamics of binary systems in post-Minkowskian gravity Thibault Damour, Alessandro Nagar, Andrea Placidi, Piero Rettegno 40 pages, 13 figures, matches published version General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We present a new approach to the conservative dynamics of binary systems, within the effective one-body (EOB) framework, based on the use of a Lagrange multiplier to impose the mass-shell constraint. When applied to the post-Minkowskian (PM) description of the two-body problem in Einsteinian gravity, this Lagrange-EOB (LEOB) approach allows for a new formulation of the conservative dynamics that avoids the drawbacks of the recursive definition of EOB-PM Hamiltonians. Using state-of-the-art expressions of the resummed waveform and radiation reaction, we apply our new formalism to the construction of an aligned-spin, quasi-circular, inspiraling EOB waveform model, called {\tt LEOB-PM}, that incorporates analytical information up to the 4PM level, completed by 4PN contributions up to the sixth order in eccentricity, in the orbital sector, and by 4.5PN contributions, in the spin-orbit sector. In the nonspinning case, we find that an uncalibrated LEOB-PM model delivers maximum EOB/NR unfaithfulness ${\bar{F}}_{\rm EOBNR}$ (with the Advanced LIGO noise in the total mass range $10-200M_\odot$) varying between $0.2\%$ and $1\%$ over all the nonspinning dataset of the Simulating eXtreme Spacetime (SXS) Numerical Relativity (NR) catalog up to mass ratio $q=15$. It also delivers excellent phasing agreement with the $q=32$ configuration of the RIT catalog. We also found consistency between binding energies within a few percent at the NR merger location. Then, when NR-informing the dynamics of the model (both orbital and spinning sectors) by using 17 SXS dataset, we find that the EOB/NR unfaithfulness (compared to 530 spin-aligned SXS waveforms) has a median value of $5.39\times 10^{-4}$, or $6.13\times 10^{-4}$ (depending on the spin-spin interactions), reaching at most $\sim 1\%$ in some of the high-spin corners.

## 8. Environmentally-induced chaos: Extreme-mass-ratio systems of rotating black holes in astrophysical environments

**Abstract**: Environmentally-induced chaos: Extreme-mass-ratio systems of rotating black holes in astrophysical environments Kyriakos Destounis, Pedro G. S. Fernandes 18 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in PRD General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, in which a stellar-mass object orbits a supermassive black hole, are prime sources of millihertz gravitational waves for upcoming space-based detectors. While most studies assume idealized vacuum backgrounds, realistic extreme-mass-ratio binaries are embedded in astrophysical environments such as accretion disks, stellar clusters, or dark matter spikes, disks, and halos, which can significantly alter the orbital dynamics. We explore bound geodesics around general-relativistic solutions describing rotating black holes surrounded by matter halos for the first time, mapping how environmental effects interfere with the spacetime symmetries of vacuum spinning (Kerr) black holes. In particular, we find that the loss of a Carter-like constant leads to geodesic non-integrability and the onset of chaos. This manifests through the formation of resonant islands and chaotic layers around transient orbital resonances in phase space--features that are otherwise completely absent in integrable Kerr geodesics. Resonant islands, which are extended, non-zero volume regions in phase space, encapsulate periodic orbit points. Non-integrability dictates that all geodesics inside the resonant island share the periodicity of the resonance. Thus, the lifespan of resonances around non-Kerr objects can be significantly enhanced beyond the predicted lifetime of Kerr resonances. Consequently, these effects can leave distinct imprints on gravitational-wave signals, with significant implications for gravitational-wave modeling and parameter inference of astrophysical extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.

## 9. Multi-messenger lensing time delay as a probe of the graviton mass

**Abstract**: Multi-messenger lensing time delay as a probe of the graviton mass Elena Colangeli, Charles Dalang, Tessa Baker General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Gravitational lensing is a powerful probe of cosmology and astrophysics. With the prospect of the first strongly lensed gravitational waves on the horizon, we highlight an opportunity to test fundamental physics. In this work, we assume a nonzero mass for the graviton, which leads to gravitational waves following timelike geodesics instead of null geodesics. We derive standard gravitational lensing equations, such as the scattering angle, the time-delay between different images and the magnification, which normally rely on the assumption of null geodesics. We show that a single strongly lensed multi-messenger event is enough to constrain the graviton mass to $m< 3 \cdot 10^{-23}$ eV/c$^{2}$. Notably this constraint is independent of the lens model, the waveform model, and of cosmology. Additionally, we explore magnification of images and find that they offer at least three orders of magnitude weaker bounds than the time delay, and have a dependence on the correct modeling of the lens and cosmology.

## 10. Is GW190521 a gravitational wave echo of wormhole remnant from another universe?

**Abstract**: Is GW190521 a gravitational wave echo of wormhole remnant from another universe? Qi Lai, Qing-Yu Lan, Hao-Yang Liu, Yu-Tong Wang, Yun-Song Piao 16 pages, 4 figures and 3 tables. To publish in JCAP General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) A particularly compelling aspect of the GW190521 event detected by the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA (LVK) collaboration is that it has an extremely short duration, and lacks a clearly identifiable inspiral phase usually observed in the binary black holes (BBHs) coalescence. In this work, we hypothesize that GW190521 might represent a single, isolated gravitational wave (GW) echo pulse from the wormhole, which is the postmerger remnant of BBHs in another universe and connected to our universe through a throat. The ringdown signal after BBHs merged in another universe can pass through the throat of wormhole and be detected in our universe as a short-duration echo pulse. Our analysis results indicate that our model yields a network signal-to-noise ratio comparable to that of the standard BBHs merger model reported by the LVK collaboration. For GW190521, Bayesian model selection yields $\ln \mathcal{B}^{\text{Echo}}_{\text{BBH}} \simeq -2.9$, indicating that the data favor the BBH hypothesis over our echo-for-wormhole model.

## 11. Robust topological invariants of timelike circular orbits for spinning test particles in black hole spacetimes

**Abstract**: Robust topological invariants of timelike circular orbits for spinning test particles in black hole spacetimes Yong Song, Jiaqi Fu, Yiting Cen 17 pages, 17 figures, Matched with the version published in Eur. Phys. J. C General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The spin-curvature coupling in the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) formalism induces non-geodesic motion, shifting the orbital parameters of spinning test particles in black hole spacetimes. We investigate whether these quantitative shifts alter the qualitative, global structure of the orbit manifold. Using a topological approach, we study timelike circular orbits (TCOs) for spinning particles in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. By constructing an auxiliary vector field, we compute the topological winding number $W$ in horizon-bounded regions of asymptotically flat, anti-de Sitter (AdS), and de Sitter (dS) backgrounds. We find that $W$ is robust against both the magnitude and direction of the particle's spin: between two horizons, $W = -1$, guaranteeing at least one unstable TCO; outside the outermost horizon in asymptotically flat and AdS spacetimes, $W = 0$, enforcing that TCOs must appear in stable-unstable pairs or be absent. This spin independence reveals that the fundamental orbital structure is a property of spacetime geometry itself, not of the particle's spin. We validate this with quantitative examples in Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild-AdS, and Schwarzschild-dS spacetimes, showing explicit spin-induced TCO shifts while confirming the invariant topology. This result provides a topological foundation for interpreting gravitational waveforms from extreme mass-ratio inspirals involving spinning secondaries.

## 12. Inspiraling binary charged black holes in an external magnetic field: Application of post-Newtonian dynamics in Einstein-Maxwell theory

**Abstract**: Inspiraling binary charged black holes in an external magnetic field: Application of post-Newtonian dynamics in Einstein-Maxwell theory RunDong Tang, Lang Liu, Wen-Biao Han 14 pages, 9 figures; Accepted by EPJC General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We present a systematic post-Newtonian treatment of binary charged black holes immersed in external magnetic fields within the framework of Einstein-Maxwell theory. By incorporating a uniform external magnetic field into the two-body Lagrangian expanded to first post-Newtonian order, we derive the complete equations of motion that capture both gravitational and electromagnetic interactions. The magnetic Lorentz force fundamentally alters the orbital dynamics, breaking the conservation of linear and angular momentum and inducing transitions from planar to three-dimensional trajectories. {Through numerical integration of these equations, we compute the resulting gravitational waveforms and characterize the distinctive magnetic field signatures through time-domain and frequency-domain analysis.} Our results demonstrate that strong background magnetic fields can substantially modify the orbital evolution and leave distinctive signatures in the gravitational wave signals. These findings provide a promising avenue for detecting charged black holes and probing magnetic field environments through gravitational wave observations.

## 13. Rethinking Resonance Detectability during Binary Neutron Star Inspiral: Accurate Mismatch Computations for Low-lying Dynamical Tides

**Abstract**: Rethinking Resonance Detectability during Binary Neutron Star Inspiral: Accurate Mismatch Computations for Low-lying Dynamical Tides Alberto Revilla-Peña, Ruxandra Bondarescu, Andrew P. Lundgren, Jordi Miralda-Escudé 13 pages, 7 figures, Submitted to Physical Review D General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We compute deviations from observed gravitational wave signals, where the amplitude of the signal is unchanged. As an example, we consider the detectability of low lying dynamical tides in binary neutron star or neutron star black hole mergers. Tidal forces can excite oscillatory modes of one or both of the stars in the binary when the orbital frequency of the binary system sweeps through the resonant mode frequency dissipating energy into the vibrational mode. The orbital energy loss to the vibrational mode extracts energy from the orbital motion, advancing the time to merger. The inspiral then continues with an excess phase and a time advance. Both will cause a mismatch when fitting to a system that has not gone through the resonance. To resolve this effect, we compute the mismatch for current and planned detectors using both a quasi-analytical approach that relies on the computation of moment integrals and an optimized version of the standard numerical match function. We conclude that detectability can occur for time advances of the order of 1 ms with advanced LVK detectors for an excess energy-flux that is a few percent of the gravitational wave emission. Our results contrast with previous work, which model this effect solely as a phase shift of the waveform or by using the difference in the number of cycles induced by the resonant behavior. We show that tidal resonance effects primarily cause a time advance of the merger, rather than a phase difference, and that the single-frequency approximation commonly used in the literature significantly overestimates the detectability of this effect.

**Abstract**: The Stochastic Siren: Astrophysical Gravitational-Wave Background Measurements of the Hubble Constant Bryce Cousins, Kristen Schumacher, Adrian Ka-Wai Chung, Colm Talbot, Thomas Callister, Daniel E. Holz, Nicolás Yunes Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We report the first measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0$ using the stochastic gravitational-wave background arising from binary black hole mergers. This astrophysical background is sensitive to the expansion history of the Universe and thus can be used for cosmological parameter inference independently of not only electromagnetic methods, but also gravitational-wave standard siren approaches. We describe the background's cosmological dependence and show how it can be used as a ``stochastic siren'' to measure $H_0$. By analyzing existing resolved binary black hole mergers and the current non-detection of the background, we find that $H_0$ can be measured more accurately relative to using resolved mergers alone. We also note that the stochastic siren may serve a unique role in the Hubble tension in that the lower bound of the $H_0$ measurement would progressively increase with continued non-detection of the background.

**Abstract**: Crossing the phantom divide in scalar-tensor and vector-tensor theories Shinji Tsujikawa Phys. Rev. D 113, L041301 (2026) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) DESI observations of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type-Ia supernova (SN Ia) data, suggest that the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm DE}$ crosses the phantom divide from $w_{\rm DE} < -1$ to $w_{\rm DE} > -1$ at low redshifts. In shift-symmetric Horndeski and generalized Proca theories with luminal gravitational-wave speed and no direct couplings to dark matter, we show that such a phantom-divide crossing is generically difficult without theoretical pathologies. Breaking the shift symmetry in Horndeski theories allows this transition. We construct an explicit model with broken shift symmetry, in which the scalar field has a potential in addition to a Galileon self-interaction and a quadratic kinetic term. This model realizes the desired phantom-divide crossing at low redshifts without introducing ghosts and Laplacian instabilities.

**Abstract**: Evading the BBN bound with a soft stiff period Lucy Brissenden, Konstantinos Dimopoulos, Eemeli Tomberg 21 pages, 10 figures. Version published in JCAP High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Cosmic inflation is the leading theory to explain early Universe history and structure formation. Non-oscillatory inflation is a class of models which can naturally introduce a post-inflationary stiff period of the Universe's evolution which boosts the signal of primordial gravitational waves (GWs), making it possible to observe them in forthcoming GW experiments. However, this pushes the GW energy density high enough to destabilise the process of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). This problem can be overcome by "softening" the stiff period, so that the field is gradually tending towards freefall from a frozen start. Here, we consider a modified hybrid inflation model where the stiff period is driven by the waterfall field, allowing the barotropic parameter of the Universe to vary, so that it does not violate the BBN constraint but produces a characteristic gravitational wave spectrum soon to be observable.

**Abstract**: Skewness in the Hellings-Downs curve Ryosuke Fujimoto, Keitaro Takahashi 15 pages, 8 figures. Submitted to Physical Review D Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Recent Pulsar Timing Array datasets provide compelling evidence for a nano-Hertz gravitational-wave background, but robust detection requires characterizing statistical fluctuations of the Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation expected from a finite population of discrete sources. Building on the variance calculation of Allen (2023), we derive the third central moment (skewness) of the HD correlation for a single unpolarized point source and an ensemble of many interfering point sources in the confusion-noise regime. To isolate the intrinsic non-Gaussianity of the background, we extend the pulsar-averaging formalism to third order by introducing a three-point averaged correlation function, which allows us to define the cosmic skewness. We find that the skewness remains non-zero in the large-source-number limit and is controlled by a new geometric three-point function. These results suggest that incorporating higher-order moments could provide additional information on source discreteness beyond standard Gaussian analyses.

**Abstract**: Resonant production of heavy particles during inflation and its gravitational wave signature Qi Chen, Yuan Yin Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We show that a quadratic $U(1)$-breaking term, together with an effective chemical potential induced by a dimension five derivative coupling between the inflaton and the $U(1)$ current, can drive efficient particle production during inflation even when the $U(1)$ field is heavier than the Hubble scale. Notably, the chemical potential enables efficient production even when the $U(1)$-breaking mass is smaller than the effective diagonal mass. We compute the gravitational wave signal generated by this mechanism during inflation, derive the primordial tensor spectrum, and map it to the present day energy density $\Omega_{\mathrm GW}(f)$. Assuming the $U(1)$ field constitutes the dominant component of dark matter, this mapping fixes the characteristic frequency, which we compare with projected sensitivity curves of ongoing and proposed gravitational wave observatories. Finally, we argue that the same dynamics are accompanied by a cosmological collider signal, providing an independent cross validation of the framework.

**Abstract**: Dynamical backreaction of a mass-acquiring scalar field on first-order phase transitions Yuan-Jie Li, Jing Liu, Zong-Kuan Guo Phys. Rev. D 113, 023550 (2026) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Phase transitions in the early Universe give rise to effective masses for massless fields in the symmetry-broken phase. We perform lattice simulations to study the dynamical impact of a mass-acquiring spectator field on the evolution of first-order phase transitions and the associated gravitational-wave production, while keeping the effective potential responsible for bubble nucleation fixed. In addition to the well-known friction effects, we identify a novel effect that significantly enhances the strength of first-order phase transitions. In contrast to the general scenario, although the effective potential governs the tunneling rate, the amplitude of the $\chi$ field is strongly suppressed inside the true vacuum bubble, resulting in a faster bubble expansion than predicted by the effective potential alone. The amplitude of the mass-acquiring field is highly suppressed in the true vacuum bubbles, resulting in additional release of vacuum energy that concentrate on the bubble walls. We further develop an analytical framework that not only explains our numerical results but can also be used to improve the estimation of gravitational-wave signals in related phase-transition scenarios.

## 20. Probing cosmology with bright sirens from the CosmoDC2_BCO LSST synthetic catalog

**Abstract**: Probing cosmology with bright sirens from the CosmoDC2_BCO LSST synthetic catalog Ranier Menote, Valerio Marra 21 pages, 3 figures and 5 tables. Matches the version accepted for publication in JCAP Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Bright sirens, i.e. gravitational-wave detections of compact binary mergers with electromagnetic counterparts, provide a self-calibrated distance-redshift relation and are therefore powerful probes of cosmic expansion. Using the CosmoDC2_BCO catalog, we forecast cosmological constraints from current (LVK) and next-generation (ET, CE) detector networks, in combination with a Roman-like Type Ia supernova sample. We find that third-generation networks reach sub-percent precision on the Hubble constant within a few years, achieving 0.2% after a decade with CE+ET+LVK, while LVK remains limited to the 6% level. The LVK fifth observing run may shed light on the H_0 tension only if the inferred value falls outside the range spanned by the Planck and SH0ES determinations, which currently achieve far higher precisions. Supernovae do not directly tighten H_0 but stabilize its inference through parameter correlations and enable an absolute calibration of the supernova magnitude M_B. In dynamical dark-energy models, the joint analysis of Roman supernovae and bright sirens yields a Figure of Merit of 25 for ET+LVK and 76 for CE+ET+LVK, to be compared with the state-of-the-art DESI DR2 BAO plus DESY5 supernovae value of 56. Sky-localization thresholds of DeltaOmega < 50 deg^2, or even DeltaOmega < 10 deg^2, entail only mild penalties, suggesting efficient follow-up strategies. These results establish third-generation GW+EM observations, especially when combined with Roman supernovae, as a cornerstone for precision cosmology in the next decade.

**Abstract**: Population synthesis of double white dwarfs: evolutionary effects on system properties Sreeta Roy, Surajit Kalita 10 pages with 4 figures; accepted in Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Double white dwarf (DWD) binaries are natural outcomes of binary stellar evolution and key sources for future space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatories such as Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We investigate how different binary interaction channels shape the physical and orbital properties of DWD systems, focusing on component masses, orbital separations, core compositions, and mass transfer rates. Using the binary population synthesis code COMPAS, we evolve $10^7$ binaries with physically motivated initial distributions of binary parameters. Our simulations reproduce the strong bimodality in the final orbital separations, including a pronounced deficit of systems around $100-500 \rm\,R_\odot$, arising from distinct evolutionary pathways: wide DWDs predominantly originate from stable Roche lobe overflow (RLOF), while close DWDs form through unstable RLOF leading to at least one common envelope (CE) phase. Moreover, we show that the core compositions of WDs provide a powerful tracer of evolutionary history: He-core WDs are strongly concentrated in close systems, whereas CO-core WDs span the full separation range and exhibit a small mass gap in wide binaries. We further identify a correlation between the accreted mass and the final orbital separation, highlighting the impact of non-conservative mass transfer on the resulting orbital configuration of DWD systems. These results underscore the links among evolutionary channels, chemical composition, and mass transfer rates; thereby provide a unique framework for interpreting Gaia DWD samples and forecasting the joint electromagnetic and GW population accessible to LISA.

**Abstract**: Astro-COLIBRI: An Innovative Platform for Real-Time Multi-Messenger Astrophysics Bernardo Cornejo Avila, Sofia Bisero, Mickael Costa, Antoine Ciric, Ilja Jaroschewski, Weizmann Kindrébéogo, Fabian Schussler Proceedings 35th annual conference on Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems (ADASS XXXV, Görlitz/Germany, 2025) Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The discovery of transient phenomena, such as supernovae, novae, Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), and stellar flares, together with the emergence of new cosmic messengers like high-energy neutrinos and Gravitational Waves (GWs), has revolutionized astrophysics in recent years. To fully exploit the scientific potential of multi-messenger and multi-wavelength follow-up observations, as well as serendipitous detections, researchers need a tool capable of rapidly compiling and contextualizing essential information for every new event. We present Astro-COLIBRI, an advanced platform designed to meet this challenge. Astro-COLIBRI is a comprehensive platform that combines a public RESTful API, real-time databases, a cloud-based alert system, and user-friendly interfaces including a website and mobile app for iOS and Android. It ingests alerts from multiple sources in real time, applies user-defined filters, and situates each event within its multi-messenger and multi-wavelength context. The platform provides clear data visualization, concise summaries of key event properties, and evaluations of observing conditions across a wide network of observatories worldwide. We here detail the architecture of Astro-COLIBRI, from the data pipelines that manage real-time alert ingestion and processing to the design of the RESTful API, which enables seamless integration with other astronomical software and services.

**Abstract**: Revisiting a Quasar Microlensing Event Towards AGN~J1249+3449 Mario Cazzolla, Francesco De Paolis, Antonio Franco, Achille Nucita 13 Pages, 7 Figures, 4 Tables. Accepted for Publication on Universe. 2026 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The gravitational wave event GW190521 seems to be the only BH merger event possibly correlated with an electromagnetic counterpart, which appeared about 34 days after the GW event. This work aims to confirm that the electromagnetic bump towards the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) J1249+3449 can be explained within the framework of the gravitational microlensing phenomenon. In particular, considering the data of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), what emerges from a detailed analysis of the observed light curve using three fitting models (Point Source Point Lens, Finite Source Point Lens, Uniform Source Binary Lens) is that the optical bump can be explained as a microlensing event caused by a lens with mass {$\sim\,$0.1 $M_{\odot}$}, lying in the host galaxy of the AGN in question.}

## 24. The formation of periodic three-body orbits for Newtonian systems

**Abstract**: The formation of periodic three-body orbits for Newtonian systems Simon Portegies Zwart, Arjen Doelman, Jelmer Sein Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Mathematical Physics (math-ph) Braids are periodic solutions to the general N-body problem in gravitational dynamics. These solutions seem special and unique, but they may result from rather usual encounters between four bodies. We aim at understanding the existence of braids in the Galaxy by reverse engineering the interactions in which they formed. We simulate self-gravitating systems of N particles, starting with the constructing of a specific braid, and bombard it with a single object. We study how frequently the bombarded braid dissolves in four singles, a triple and a single, a binary and 2 singles, or 2 binaries. The relative proportion of those events gives us insight into how easy it is to generate a braid through the reverse process. It turns out that braids are easily generated from encounters between 2 binaries, or a triple with a single object, independent on the braid's stability. We find that 3 of the explored braids are linearly stable against small perturbations, whereas one is unstable and short-lived. The shortest-lived braid appears the least stable and the most chaotic. nonplanar encounters also lead to braid formation, which, in our experiments, themselves are planar. The parameter space in azimuth and polar angle that lead to braid formation via binary-binary or triple-single encounters is anisotropic, and the distribution has a low fractal dimension. Since a substantial fraction of ~9% of our calculations lead to periodic 3-body systems, braids may be more common than expected. They could form in multi-body interactions. We do not expect many to exist for time, but they may be common as transients, as they survive for tens to hundreds of periodic orbits. We argue that braids are common in relatively shallow-potential background fields, such as the Oort cloud or the Galactic halo. If composed of compact objects, they potentially form interesting targets for gravitational wave detectors.

**Abstract**: Super amplification of lunar response to gravitational waves driven by thick crust Lei Zhang, Jinhai Zhang, Han Yan, Xian Chen A new version with new title has been uploaded (arXiv:2601.16567) Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph) The Moon has been long regarded as a natural resonator of gravitational waves (GWs) since 1960, showing great potential to fill the frequency gap left behind GW detections by ground- or space-based laser interferometry. However, the spatial variation of this amplification capacity on the Moon remains unclear. Here, we numerically simulate the lunar response to GWs by fully considering the fluctuant topography and laterally heterogeneous interior structures. Our results show that most regions on the Moon can amplify GWs with a ratio over 2, a finding significantly higher than previous estimations. Particularly, the amplification ratio can even reach factors of tens at the resonant frequency of ~0.015 Hz on the highlands surrounding the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin, where the regional crust is the thickest. Our findings establish the thick-crust regions as critical zones of GW amplification, which is essential for future landing site selection and instrumental setting for GW detection on the Moon.
