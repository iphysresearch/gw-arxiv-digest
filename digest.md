**Abstract**: Probing regular black holes with sub-Planckian curvature through periodic orbits and their gravitational wave radiation Soroush Zare, Tao Zhu, Luis M. Nieto, Shuo Lu, Hassan Hassanabadi General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are among the key targets for future space-based gravitational wave detectors. The gravitational waveforms emitted by EMRIs are highly sensitive to the orbital dynamics of the small compact object, which in turn are determined by the geometry of the underlying spacetime. In this paper, we explore the de- tectability of regular black holes with sub-Planckian curvature, which can be interpreted as regularized versions of the Schwarzschild black hole (RSBH). To do so, we begin by ana- lyzing the metric and geodesics, determining the effective potential, and investigating the marginally bound orbits and the innermost stable circular orbits for timelike particles. Our analysis reveals that orbital radius, angular momentum, and energy significantly depend on the model parameter {\alpha} for both orbits. Our main aim is to focus on the influence of the model parameter on a specific kind of orbit, the periodic orbit, surrounding a supermassive RSBH. The findings show that, for a constant rational integer, {\alpha} has a significant impact on the energy and angular momentum of the periodic orbit. Utilising the numerical kludge method, we further investigate the gravitational waveforms of the small celestial body over various periodic orbits. The waveforms display discrete zoom and spin phases within a complete orbital period, influenced by the RSBH parameter {\alpha}. As the system evolves, the phase shift in the gravitational waveforms grows progressively more pronounced, with cumulative deviations amplifying over time. With the ongoing advancements in space- based gravitational wave detection systems, our results will aid in leveraging EMRIs to probe and characterize the RSBH properties.

**Abstract**: Binary Neutron Stars from the Moon: Early Warnings and Precision Science for the Artemis Era Anjali B. Yelikar, Karan Jani 20 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables. Target journal- CQG General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Binary neutron star mergers are unique probes of matter at extreme density and standard candles of cosmic expansion. The only such event observed in both gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation, GW170817, revealed the origin of heavy elements, constrained the neutron star equation of state, and provided an independent measurement of the Hubble constant. Current detectors such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA capture only the final minutes of inspiral, offering limited advance warning and coarse sky localization. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of binary neutron star signals for lunar-based gravitational-wave observatories (LILA, LGWA, GLOC) envisioned within NASA's Artemis and Commercial Lunar Payload Services programs, and compare their performance with current and next-generation Earth-based facilities. For GW170817-like sources, we find that lunar detectors can forecast mergers weeks to months in advance and localize them to areas as small as 0.01 deg$^{2}$, far beyond the reach of terrestrial detectors. We further show that lunar observatories would detect on the order of 100 well-localized mergers annually, enabling coordinated multi-messenger follow-up. When combined in a multi-band LIGO+Moon network, sky-localization areas shrink to just a few arcsec$^{2}$, comparable to the field of view of the James Webb Space Telescope at high zoom. Multi-band parameter estimation also delivers dramatic gains: neutron star mass-ratio uncertainties can be measured with $\sim0.1\%$ precision, spin constraints to 0.001$\%$ with luminosity distance errors to 1$\%$ level, enabling precision measurements of the equation of state and the cosmic expansion rate. Our results demonstrate that lunar gravitational-wave observatories would revolutionize multi-messenger astrophysics with binary neutron stars and open a unique discovery landscape in the Artemis era.

**Abstract**: Motions of spinning particles in the Kerr-Newman black hole exterior and gravitational wave emission. I. Periodic orbits Yi-Ping Chen, Tien Hsieh, Da-Shin Lee General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The motion of a spinning particle in the exterior of the Kerr-Newman black hole is studied. The dynamics is governed by the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations in the pole-dipole approximation through the spin-curvature coupling to the leading order in its spin. In terms of conserved quantities, one can transform the dynamical equations in the Mino time into an integral form for both aligned and misaligned spins with orbital motion. These non-geodesic equations can be solved analytically with the solutions involving Jacobi elliptic functions. The radial potential can be derived in order to study the parameter space of the particle for various types of orbit, based on its roots obtained with the corrections of the particle's spin. We consider motion oscillating around two turning points, which are the two outermost roots of the radial potential on the equatorial plane in the misaligned case. In this case, there is an induced oscillatory motion out of the equatorial plane. In particular, the oscillation periods of the motion are obtained. When the orbits become a source of gravitational wave emission, these periods of motion will play a key role in determining the gravitational waves in the frequency domain. Numerical kludge waveforms are constructed. The gravitational wave amplitudes are found to be sensitive to the turning points of the orbits as measured from the black holes. The implications for gravitational wave emission due to extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are discussed.

## 4. Pulsar timing array analysis in a Legendre polynomial basis

**Abstract**: Pulsar timing array analysis in a Legendre polynomial basis Bruce Allen, Arian L. von Blanckenburg, Ken D. Olum 17 pages, 4 figures, to be submitted to PRD General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We use Legendre polynomials (previously discussed in this context by Pitrou and Cusin [1]) to model signals in pulsar timing arrays (PTA). These replace the (Fourier mode) basis of trigonometric functions normally used for data analysis. The Legendre basis makes it simpler to incorporate pulsar modeling effects, which remove constant-, linear-, and quadratic-in-time terms from pulsar timing residuals. In the Legendre basis, this zeroes the amplitudes of the the first three Legendre polynomials. We use this basis to construct an optimal quadratic cross-correlation estimator $\widehat{\mu}$ of the Hellings and Downs (HD) correlation and compute its variance $\sigma^2_{\widehat{\mu}}$ in the way described by Allen and Romano [2]. Remarkably, if the gravitational-wave background (GWB) and pulsar noise power spectra are (sums of) power laws in frequency, then in this basis one obtains analytic closed forms for many quantities of interest.

## 5. Studying the gravitational-wave population without looking that FAR out

**Abstract**: Studying the gravitational-wave population without looking that FAR out Noah E. Wolfe, Matthew Mould, Jack Heinzel, Salvatore Vitale 12 pages, 6 figures; to be submitted to Physical Review D. Comments welcome! General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) From catalogs of gravitational-wave transients, the population-level properties of their sources and the formation channels of merging compact binaries can be constrained. However, astrophysical conclusions can be biased by misspecification or misestimation of the population likelihood. Despite detection thresholds on the false-alarm rate (FAR) or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the current catalog is likely contaminated by noise transients. Further, computing the population likelihood becomes less accurate as the catalog grows. Current methods to address these challenges often scale poorly with the number of events and potentially become infeasible for future catalogs. Here, we evaluate a simple remedy: increasing the significance threshold for including events in population analyses. To determine the efficacy of this approach, we analyze simulated catalogs of up to 1600 gravitational-wave signals from black-hole mergers using full Bayesian parameter estimation with current detector sensitivities. We show that the growth in statistical uncertainty about the black-hole population, as we analyze fewer events but with higher SNR, depends on the source parameters of interest. When the SNR threshold is raised from 11 to 15 -- reducing our catalog size by two--thirds -- we find that statistical uncertainties on the mass distribution only grow by a few 10% and constraints on the spin distribution are essentially unchanged; meanwhile, uncertainties on the high-redshift cosmic merger rate more than double. Simultaneously, numerical uncertainty in the estimate of the population likelihood more than halves, allowing us to ensure unbiased inference without additional computational expense. Our results demonstrate that focusing on higher-significance events is an effective way to facilitate robust astrophysical inference with growing gravitational-wave catalogs.

**Abstract**: Primordial Black Holes at the Junction James B. Dent, Bhaskar Dutta, Mudit Rai High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Primordial black holes (PBHs) formed during first-order phase transitions provide a powerful link between the early-universe microphysics and observable signatures today, including dark matter and gravitational waves. In this work we develop a unified description of PBH formation based on the Israel junction conditions, which capture collapse dynamics without relying on conventional overdensity or pressure-balance arguments. As a first application, we show that exotic objects such as Fermi-balls can collapse into PBHs even when most of the vacuum energy is trapped in solitonic cores, leading to a different gravitational-wave signal relative to vacuum-only scenarios. As a second application, we study multiple phase transitions in a hidden sector, which generate correlated gravitational-wave spectra and PBH abundances across transitions. Our framework, while analytically controlled, is broadly applicable to hidden-sector models with general vacuum, radiation, and matter contributions. We present the resulting predictions for PBH mass spectra, dark matter fractions, and gravitational-wave signals, highlighting parameter regions that remain open in current searches and motivating future probes.

**Abstract**: Stochastic Gravitational Waves from Modulated Reheating Michele Benaco, Dimitrios Karamitros, Sami Nurmi, Kimmo Tuominen 13 pages plus appendices, 6 figures. Comments welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We investigate scalar-induced stochastic gravitational waves from adiabatic curvature perturbations sourced by a spectator field via the modulated reheating mechanism. We consider a spectator scalar with Higgs-like couplings and inflaton decay via shift symmetric dimension-five operators. The spectator is assumed to be in the Sitter vacuum and it sources blue-tilted, strongly non-Gaussian curvature perturbations which can dominate the spectrum on small scales $k \gg \rm{Mpc}^{-1}$. We find that the setup could generate a gravitational wave signal testable by surveys like BBO and DECIGO but only for large coupling values not expected in low-energy particle physics setups that can be perturbatively extrapolated up to the inflationary scale.

**Abstract**: Post-Newtonian dynamics of compact binaries with mass transfer Zi-Han Zhang, Tan Liu, Zong-Kuan Guo General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Taking into account the mass transfer effect, we derive the equations of motion of a compact binary system at the second-half post-Newtonian order. Applying such equations of motion to quasi-circular orbits, we obtain the time derivative of the orbital frequency, which is consistent with the angular momentum balance equation. Numerical estimates of the phase of gravitational waves are provided for typical mass transfer rates. Our result can be used to improve the waveforms of gravitational waves emitted by compact binaries with mass transfer.

**Abstract**: Verification of the Black Hole Area Law with GW230814 Shao-Peng Tang, Hai-Tian Wang, Yin-Jie Li, Yi-Zhong Fan General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We present an observational confirmation of Hawking's black-hole area theorem using the newly released gravitational-wave data from the GWTC-4.0. We analyze the high signal-to-noise ratio binary black hole (BBH) merger GW230814 and measure the (total) horizon area of the black holes before and after the merger. For preferred (and reasonable) choices of the post-truncation start time, the horizon area of the remnant black hole is found to be greater than the total horizon area of the two pre-merger black holes at a high possibility (at least $\gtrsim 99.5\%$). Importantly, our analysis accounts for sky-location uncertainty. These results provide a stringent observational confirmation of the black-hole area law, further bolstering the validity of classical general relativity in the dynamical, strong-field regime.

**Abstract**: Gravitomagnetic-Hydrodynamics and Turbulence in Early Universe Jiaxiang Liang, Peng Xu, Minghui Du, Yifu Cheng, Zhan Wang, Ziren Luo General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) This work tries to establish the theoretical framework for gravitomagnetic-hydrodynamics (GMHD), revealing a fundamental correspondence between geometrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamic phenomena in general relativity. By introducing the gravitoelectromagnetic formalism to relativistic fluids, a set of leading-order GMHD equations is derived that govern the co-evolution of spacetime geometry and matter dynamics in the early Universe. This analysis reveals that, under high-temperature and high-density conditions such as those during the electroweak phase transition, the gravitomagnetic Reynolds number becomes large, leading to a strongly coupled fluid-spacetime system. This coupling supports the emergence of gravitational Alfven waves and a turbulent energy cascade. Our findings suggest that GMHD turbulence may leave imprints on the stochastic gravitational wave background, offering a new window into the nonlinear dynamics of the primordial Universe.

**Abstract**: Duality and four-dimensional black holes: gravitational waves, algebraically special solutions, pole skipping, and the spectral duality relation in holographic thermal CFTs Sa≈°o Grozdanov, Mile Vrbica 8 figures, v3: minor corrections High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The physics of gravitational waves and other classical fields on specifically four-dimensional backgrounds of black holes exhibits electric-magnetic-like dualities. In this paper, we discuss the structure of such dualities in terms of geometrical quantities with a physically-intuitive interpretation. In turn, we explain the interplay between the algebraic structure of black hole spacetimes and their associated dualities. For large classes of black hole geometries, explicit constructions are presented. We then use these results and apply them to the holographic study of three-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), discussing how such dualities place stringent constraints on the thermal spectra of correlators. In particular, the dualities enforce the recently-developed spectral duality relation along with a multitude of implications for the physics of thermal CFTs. A number of numerical results supporting our conclusions is also presented, including a demonstration of how the longitudinal spectrum of quasinormal modes determines the transverse spectrum, and vice versa.

Using a nonperturbative $\delta N$ approach applied to the lattice output, we generate fully nonlinear three-dimensional maps of $\zeta$. This calculation captures both the non-Gaussianity arising from the nonlinear mapping between $\phi$ and $\zeta$, and the intrinsic non-Gaussianity generated around Hubble crossing by the nonlinear field dynamics, which is neglected in stochastic approaches. We find that the nonlinear mapping has a profound impact on the statistics, significantly enhancing the positive tail of the $\zeta$ probability distribution, with important implications for observable quantities. A central part of this work is the comparison with the standard perturbative treatment based on a gauge transformation, which allows us to quantify when and how the perturbative picture breaks down as fluctuations grow large. Together with arXiv:2410.23942, this work sets the basis for robust, nonperturbative predictions of primordial black hole production and scalar-induced gravitational wave emission from inflation using lattice simulations.

Barish As part of the Astrophysical Journal Letters Focus Issue on the Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We analyze data from 142 of the 218 gravitational-wave (GW) sources in the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration (LVK) Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4.0) to estimate the Hubble constant $H_0$ jointly with the population properties of merging compact binaries. We measure the luminosity distance and redshifted masses of GW sources directly; in contrast, we infer GW source redshifts statistically through i) location of features in the compact object mass spectrum and merger rate evolution, and ii) identifying potential host galaxies in the GW localization volume. Probing the relationship between source luminosity distances and redshifts obtained in this way yields constraints on cosmological parameters. We also constrain parameterized deviations from general relativity which affect GW propagation, specifically those modifying the dependence of a GW signal on the source luminosity distance. Assuming our fiducial model for the source-frame mass distribution and using GW candidates detected up to the end of the fourth observing run (O4a), together with the GLADE+ all-sky galaxy catalog, we estimate $H_0 = 76.6^{+13.0}_{-9.5} (76.6^{+25.2}_{-14.0})$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. This value is reported as a median with 68.3% (90%) symmetric credible interval, and includes combination with the $H_0$ measurement from GW170817 and its electromagnetic counterpart. Using a parametrization of modified GW propagation in terms of the magnitude parameter $\Xi_0$, we estimate $\Xi_0 = 1.2^{+0.8}_{-0.4} (1.2^{+2.4}_{-0.5})$, where $\Xi_0 = 1$ recovers the behavior of general relativity.

**Abstract**: Probing Reheating Phase via Non-Helical Magnetogenesis and Secondary Gravitational Waves Subhasis Maiti, Debaprasad Maity, Rohan Srikanth This version matches the published version, and all citations have been added Phys.Rev.D 112 (2025) 6, 063552 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) In the past two decades, significant advancements have been made in observational techniques to enhance our understanding of the universe and its evolutionary processes. However, our knowledge of the post-inflation reheating phase remains limited due to its small-scale dynamics. Traditional observations, such as those of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), primarily provide insights into large-scale dynamics, making it challenging to glean information about the reheating era. In this paper, our primary aim is to explore how the generation of Gravitational Waves (GWs) spectra, resulting from electromagnetic fields in the early universe, can offer valuable insights into the Reheating dynamics. We investigate how the spectral shape of GWs varies across different frequency ranges, depending on the initial magnetic profile and reheating dynamics. For this, we consider a well-known non-helical magnetogenesis model, where the usual electromagnetic kinetic term is coupled with a background scalar. Notably, for such a scenario, we observe distinct spectral shapes with sufficiently high amplitudes for different reheating histories with the equation of state parametrized by ($w_{\rm re}$). We identify spectral breaks in the GW spectra for both $w_{\rm re}<1/3$ and $w_{\rm re}>1/3$ scenarios. We find that future GW experiments such as BBO, LISA, SKA, and DECIGO are well within the reach of observing those distinct spectral shapes and can potentially shed light on the underlying mechanism of the reheating phase.

**Abstract**: Gravitational Recoil and Suppression of Super Massive Black Hole Seeds in the Early Universe Bisweswar Sen 5 Pages , 5 Figures , All code is publicly available at this https URL Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We investigate the impact of gravitational-wave (GW) recoil on the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe. Forming 10^9 Solar Mass SMBHs by z=6 is challenging and may require hierarchical mergers of smaller seed black holes. We extend a semi-analytic seed model by explicitly incorporating GW recoil physics. Our model includes: (1) recoil velocity formulae calibrated to numerical relativity for spinning, unequal-mass BH binaries (Campanelli2007,Lousto2012); (2) assignment of spin magnitudes and orientations based on seed type (Population III remnant, stellar cluster, or direct-collapse); and (3) a retention probability scheme comparing the recoil speed to the host halo escape velocity. We find that including GW recoil reduces final SMBH masses by approximately 20-30% by z=6 and creates a population of off-nuclear (``wandering'') BHs amounting to a few percent of the total. Observable consequences include spatial offsets approximately 0.1'' and line-of-sight velocity shifts approximately 10^2-10^3 km\s in a few-percent of high-redshift quasars.

**Abstract**: 22 pages, 6 figures. Article for the Encyclopedia of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Editor Ilya Mandel, Section Editor Jeff Andrews High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Gamma-ray bursts are flashes of high-energy radiation lasting from a fraction of a second to several hours. Military satellites made the first detections of GRBs in the late 1960s. The $\gamma$-ray emission forms from shocks in a relativistic jet launched from a compact central engine. In addition to the emission of $\gamma$-rays, the interaction of the jet with the surrounding medium yields afterglow emission that can be observed across the electromagnetic spectrum. Redshift measurements from these afterglows place GRBs from the local to the distant Universe. The central engines of GRBs are thought to be either a hyperaccreting black hole or a highly magnetized neutron star (magnetar). There is now strong observational evidence that this central engine is created either in the core collapse of a rapidly rotating massive star or via the merger of two compact objects (neutron stars or a neutron star with a black hole). The combination of stellar scale events with extreme energies and luminosities makes GRBs powerful probes of the extreme physics involved in their production and of other areas of astrophysics and cosmology. These include as the electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave sources, the production and acceleration of relativistic jets, the synthesis of heavy elements, the study of the interstellar and intergalactic medium, and the identification of the collapse of early generations of stars.

## 17. Beyond $œÅ^{2/3}$ Scaling: Microscopic Origins and Multimessengers of High-Density Nuclear Symmetry Energy

**Abstract**: Beyond $œÅ^{2/3}$ Scaling: Microscopic Origins and Multimessengers of High-Density Nuclear Symmetry Energy Bao-An Li 43-pages invited contribution to the Euro. Phys. Jour. Special Topic on "High density nuclear matter". This article is dedicated to the memory of Prof. Philip J. Siemens (1943-2023) Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex) Nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ encoding the cost to make nuclear matter more neutron rich has been the most uncertain component of the EOS of dense neutron-rich nucleonic matter. It affects significantly the radii, tidal deformations, cooling rates and frequencies of various oscillation modes of isolated neutron stars as well as the strain amplitude and frequencies of gravitational waves from their mergers, besides its many effects on structures of nuclei as well as the dynamics and observables of their collisions. Siemens (1970s) observed that $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ scales as $(\rho/\rho_0)^{2/3}$ near the saturation density $\rho_0$ of nuclear matter, since both the kinetic part and the potential contribution (quadratic in momentum) exhibit this dependence. The scaling holds if: (1) the nucleon isoscalar potential is quadratic in momentum, and (2) the isovector interaction is weakly density dependent. After examining many empirical evidences and understanding theoretical findings in the literature we conclude that: (1) Siemens' $\rho^{2/3}$ scaling is robust and serves as a valuable benchmark for both nuclear theories and experiments up to $2\rho_0$ but breaks down at higher densities, (2) Experimental and theoretical findings about $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ up to $2\rho_0$ are broadly consistent, but uncertainties remain large for its curvature $K_{\mathrm{sym}}$ and higher-order parameters, (3) Above $2\rho_0$, uncertainties grow due to poorly constrained spin-isospin dependent tensor and three-body forces as well as the resulting nucleon short-range correlations. Looking forward, combining multimessengers from both observations of neutron stars and terrestrial heavy-ion reaction experiments is the most promising path to finally constraining precisely the high-density $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ and the EOS of supradense neutron-rich matter.

## 18. On the Formation of GW231123 in Population III Star Clusters

**arXiv**: [2510.05634](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05634)

**Abstract**: On the Formation of GW231123 in Population III Star Clusters Shuai Liu, Long Wang, Ataru Tanikawa, Weiwei Wu, Michiko S. Fujii 8 pages, 4 figures, and 1 table. Accepted by ApJL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) GW231123 is a binary black hole merger whose primary component lies within or above the pair-instability mass gap, while the secondary component falls within this gap. The standard theory of stellar evolution is significantly challenged by this event. We investigate the formation of candidate progenitors of GW231123 in Population III (Pop3) star clusters. We find that they could form through stellar mergers, binary black hole mergers, and mixed mergers. The mass distribution of these candidate progenitors covers the component masses of GW231123. Their predicted merger rate density spans the range of $0.001{\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}-0.26{\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$, encompassing that of GW231123. These findings suggest that GW231123 may originate from Pop3 star clusters. Furthermore, such candidate progenitors are expected to be detectable by future gravitational wave detectors LISA/Taiji/TianQin/DECIGO/CE/ET, which would provide valuable insights into the formation scenarios of events like GW231123.
