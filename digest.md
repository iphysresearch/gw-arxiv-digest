**Abstract**: Inferring neutron-star Love-Q relations from gravitational waves in the hierarchical Bayesian framework Zhihao Zheng, Ziming Wang, Jinwen Deng, Yiming Dong, Lijing Shao General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Despite the large uncertainties in the equation of state for neutron stars (NSs), a tight universal ``Love-Q'' relation exists between their dimensionless tidal deformability, $\Lambda$, and the dimensionless quadrupole moment, $Q$. However, this relation has not yet been directly measured through observations. Gravitational waves (GWs) emitted from binary NS (BNS) coalescences provide an avenue for such a measurement. In this study, we adopt a hierarchical Bayesian framework and combine multiple simulated GW events to measure the Love-Q relation. We simulate 1000 GW sources and select 20 events with the highest signal-to-noise ratios and NS spins for the analysis. By inspecting four parameterization models of the Love-Q relation, we observe strong correlations between the model parameters. We verify that a linear relation between $\ln\Lambda$ and $\ln Q$ is practically sufficient to describe the Love-Q relation with the precision expected from next-generation GW detectors. Furthermore, we utilize the inferred Love-Q relation to test modified gravity. Taking the dynamical Chern-Simons gravity as an example, our results suggest that the characteristic length can be constrained to $10\, \mathrm{km}$ or less with future GW observations.

## 2. Eccentric extreme-mass-ratio inspirals: a new window into ultra-light vector fields

**Abstract**: Eccentric extreme-mass-ratio inspirals: a new window into ultra-light vector fields Tieguang Zi, Fu-Wen Shu will be published in European Physical Journal C (2025) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Space-based gravitational-wave detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), provide a platform to probe new fundamental fields through extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), where a compact secondary object carrying scalar or vector charges inspirals into a massive primary. In a theory-agnostic framework, we compute the ultra-light vector and gravitational radiation emitted by eccentric EMRIs and determine the corresponding inspiral trajectories. We evaluate the impact of a massive vector (Proca) field on EMRIs waveform through dephasing and mismatches with predictions by general relativity. Using a Fisher information matrix analysis, we further assess LISA's capability to constrain the Proca mass from future EMRIs observations. We find that orbital eccentricity can improve estimation accuracy of parameters, making the vector mass $\mu$ become detectable for the case of $\mu=0.02$ . Correlation analysis further reveals strong positive dependencies between the Proca mass and intrinsic source parameters, indicating that improved measurement of these parameters directly tightens constraints on vector mass. These results demonstrate that high-eccentricity EMRIs observed by LISA offer a powerful channel to detect or constrain massive vector-field extensions of GR in the strong-field regime.

Using the Hamiltonian formalism, we derive equations of motion and analyze the effective potential. We determine the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO) and innermost bound circular orbits (IBCO) radii for different values of the Yukawa parameters $\lambda$ and $\delta$, and classify periodic orbits via rational frequency analysis, highlighting deviations from Schwarzschild geometry. We also study gravitational wave (GW) emission from periodic orbits and show how Yukawa terms affect GW signals. Fundamental frequencies are computed, and QPOs are analyzed using relativistic precession, warped disk, and tidal disruption models. By increasing $\lambda$, the ENLMY spacetime effectively mimics the behavior of a Schwarzschild spacetime. Constraints on the BH mass and Yukawa parameters are derived using QPO data from stellar-mass (XTE J1550-564, GRO J1655-40, GRS 1915+105), intermediate-mass (M82 X-1), and supermassive (Sgr A*) BHs within the relativistic precession model by employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis.

## 4. Lensing, not luck! Detection prospects of strongly lensed gravitational waves

**Abstract**: Lensing, not luck! Detection prospects of strongly lensed gravitational waves A. Barsode, K. N. Maity, P. Ajith General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) A small fraction of gravitational-wave (GW) signals detected by ground-based observatories will be strongly lensed by intervening galaxies or clusters. This may produce multiple copies of the signals (i.e., lensed images) arriving at different times at the detector. These, if observed, could offer new probes of astrophysics and cosmology. However, identification of lensed image pairs among a large number of unrelated GW events is challenging. Though the number of lensed events increases with improved detector sensitivity, the false alarms increase quadratically faster. While this "lensing or luck" problem would appear to be insurmountable, we show that the expected increase in measurement precision of source parameters will efficiently weed out false alarms. Based on current astrophysical models and anticipated sensitivities, we predict that the first confident detection could occur in the fifth observing run of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. We expect computational costs to be a major hurdle in achieving such a detection, and show that the Posterior Overlap 2.0 method may offer a near-optimal solution to this challenge.

## 5. Probing Warm Inflation via Correlated Gravitational Waves from First Order Phase Transitions

**Abstract**: Probing Warm Inflation via Correlated Gravitational Waves from First Order Phase Transitions Xiao-Bin Sui, Jing Liu, Rong-Gen Cai General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate the properties of gravitational waves generated by heating induced phase transitions in warm inflation. In this scenario, the heating phase of inflation followed by subsequent cosmological cooling can trigger two associated first-order phase transitions and generate characteristic gravitational waves. The correlated gravitational wave spectral features amplitude, peak frequencies, and oscillatory behavior originate from a unified model governing both phase transitions. These signatures allow discrimination between warm and cold inflation models, and give constraint on the key parameters including the dissipative coupling strength and the inflationary energy scale, collectively illuminating early-Universe dissipative dynamics. Future gravitational wave observatories such as BBO, Ultimate DECIGO, $\mu$Ares, resonant cavities, and Pulsar Timing Array experiments, will play a important role in testing these theoretical predictions.

## 6. Binary gravitational waves as probes of quantum graviton states

**Abstract**: Binary gravitational waves as probes of quantum graviton states Sugumi Kanno, Jiro Soda, Akira Taniguchi General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph) It is well known that the most reliable way to reveal the quantum nature of light is through photon number statistics, since photons exhibiting sub-Poissonian statistics unambiguously demonstrate their quantum behavior. In this paper, we show that gravitons emitted by binary systems can, in principle, exhibit analogous sub-Poissonian statistics. The key idea is that the vacuum state of gravitons may not be the standard Minkowski vacuum but rather a nonclassical state imprinted with the physics of the early Universe, such as inflation. Accordingly, gravitational waves from binary systems provide a means to probe the graviton states generated in the early Universe. As a concrete example, we show that squeezed graviton states originating from inflation may be detected through the observation of gravitational waves from binary systems.

**Abstract**: Shadows of the Colossus: Hierarchical Black Hole Mergers in a 10-million-body Globular Cluster Simulation Aidan Mai, Kyle Kremer, Fulya Kiroglu 17 pages, 12 figures, 1 table. Submitted to ApJ. Comments welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (LVK) Collaboration has detected numerous binary black hole mergers with properties that challenge standard binary evolution scenarios, such as component masses above the pair-instability gap and high spin magnitudes. Dense stellar environments such as globular clusters provide a natural channel for producing such systems through hierarchical mergers, where black hole remnants formed in earlier mergers are retained in the cluster and undergo successive mergers. However, gravitational-wave recoil kicks often eject merger remnants from typical globular clusters, which limits hierarchical growth. Massive clusters with deeper potential wells, such as those found in giant elliptical galaxies like M87, may overcome this barrier, but direct simulations of such massive globular clusters remains computationally challenging. In this study, we present a 10-million-body cluster simulation performed with the $\texttt{Cluster Monte Carlo}$ ($\texttt{CMC}$) code, referred to as $\texttt{colossus}$, which serves as a proxy for the most massive low-metallicity globular clusters observed in the local Universe. This simulation demonstrates that extended chains of hierarchical mergers can occur in massive globular clusters, producing black holes up to fifth generation with masses approaching $250\,M_\odot$, comparable to the most massive LVK events observed to date (e.g., GW231123). Combining the $\texttt{colossus}$ simulation with the previous $\texttt{CMC Cluster Catalog}$, we develop a framework to extrapolate binary black hole merger predictions for the thousands of globular clusters seen in the Virgo Supercluster.

**Abstract**: Characterizing Low-Latency Sky Localization in Multi-Detector Gravitational-Wave Networks Amazigh Ouzriat, Viola Sordini, Francesco Di Renzo 14 pages, 17 figures. Submitted to A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Low-latency analyses of gravitational-wave (GW) data from LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA enable rapid detection of compact binary coalescences (CBC) and prompt sky localization, essential for electromagnetic follow-up in multi-messenger astronomy. We evaluate the performance and limitations of low-latency sky localization using BAYESTAR algorithm, and investigate the impact of low-significance Virgo triggers. We inject simulated CBC signals into Gaussian-stationary noise and into Virgo data from the second part of the third LIGO-Virgo observing run (O3b), then reconstruct skymaps across multiple detector network configurations. Localization accuracy is assessed using Percentile-Percentile plots, the Jaccard index, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Binary neutron star mergers are statistically consistent with ideal calibration, showing deviations below 3$\sigma$, particularly when Virgo is included in the network, whereas skymaps for neutron star--black hole and binary black hole mergers tend to be overconfident. Adding a third detector generally improves accuracy, but the searched area can degrade when Virgo's signal-to-noise ratio is low (SNR $\leq$ 5). For high-SNR events, relying on two detectors can mislocalize the source. Excluding Virgo can therefore cause the HL skymap to miss the true location when Virgo has strong antenna response, in such cases a three-detector configuration is required to recover the correct position and avoid misleading multi-messenger follow-up. We introduce diagnostics to flag problematic skymaps and apply them to O3 public alerts, recovering simulation-predicted trends and flagging a few anomalous morphologies. The results are relevant for improving rapid vetting of GW alerts and guiding observational strategies in multi-messenger astronomy.

**Abstract**: Constraining the Hubble Constant using Cross-Correlation of Gravitational Wave Events with Flux-Limited Galaxy Catalog Tathagata Ghosh, Surhud More Contribution to the GR24 & Amaldi16 conference proceedings; 4 pages, 2 figures Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Gravitational waves (GWs) from the compact binary coalescence provide direct measurement of the luminosity distance to the event. However, unlike binary neutron stars, redshift information is not available from GW observations of binary black holes. Consequently, independent redshift measurements of such GW events are necessary to measure $H_0$. In this study, we demonstrate a novel Bayesian formalism to infer $H_0$ utilizing the $3$D cross-correlation of GW events with galaxies from flux-limited catalog in configuration space. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method with $300$ simulated GW events distributed within $1$ Gpc in colored Gaussian noise of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors operating at O4 sensitivity. We show that such measurements can constrain the Hubble constant with a precision of $\sim 9 \%$ ($90\%$ highest density interval). We highlight the potential improvements that need to be accounted for in further studies before the method can be applied to real data.

## 10. Avoiding PBH overproduction in inflation model with modified dispersion relation

**Abstract**: Avoiding PBH overproduction in inflation model with modified dispersion relation Chengrui Yang, Weixin Cai, Taotao Qiu Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) The Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data of nano-Hertz gravitational waves released in 2023 implies that if such gravitational waves comes from the scalar perturbation induction at the end of inflation, the accompanied primordial black holes (PBHs) will be over-produced, with the fraction exceed the upper bound of unity. This is recognized as the ``overproduction problem", which calls for nontrivial features in the early universe. In this paper, we try to check out whether a modified dispersion relation (MDR) of the primordial perturbations can be helpful for solving the problem. From the constraint on PTA data, we obtain a posterior distribution of the parameters of primordial perturbation, and find that the MDR model, where the $k^4$ term becomes important at later time, can give rise to a broken-power-law (BPL) power spectrum which can alleviate the overproduction problem to nearly $2\sigma$ level. However, to improve furtherly into $1\sigma$ still needs small negative non-Gaussianity, e.g. $f_{\rm nl}\simeq -1$. The mass distribution of the PBHs generated is also discussed.

**Abstract**: Analyzing GW231109_235456 and understanding its potential implications for population studies, nuclear physics, and multi-messenger astronomy Thibeau Wouters, Anna Puecher, Peter T. H. Pang, Tim Dietrich High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We study the gravitational-wave trigger GW231109_235456, a sub-threshold binary neutron star merger candidate observed in the first part of the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. Assuming the trigger is of astrophysical origin, we analyze it using state-of-the-art waveform models and investigate the robustness of the inferred source parameters under different prior choices in Bayesian inference. We assess the implications for population studies, nuclear physics, and multi-messenger astronomy. Analysing the component masses, we find that GW231109_235456 supports the proposed double Gaussian mass distribution of neutron star masses. Moreover, we find that the remnant most likely collapsed promptly to a black hole and that, because of the large distance, a possible kilonova connected to the merger was noticeably dimmer than AT2017gfo. In addition, we provide constraints on the equation of state from GW231109_235456 alone, as well as combined with GW170817 and GW190425. In our projections for the future, we simulate a similar event using the upcoming generation of gravitational-wave detectors. Our findings indicate that we can constrain the neutron star radius with an accuracy of 400 meters using the Einstein Telescope alone, or 300 meters when combined with the Cosmic Explorer, both at 90% credibility.

## 12. A new group of low-spin $50-70M_\odot$ Black Holes and the high pair-instability mass cutoff

**Abstract**: A new group of low-spin $50-70M_\odot$ Black Holes and the high pair-instability mass cutoff Yuan-Zhu Wang, Yin-Jie Li, Shi-Jie Gao, Shao-Peng Tang, Yi-Zhong Fan 8 pages, 5 figures. Comments are welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Pair-instability supernovae (PISN) will not leave compact remnants and hence yield a mass gap of the black holes. Though a transition point of $\sim 45M_\odot$ between low-spin and high-spin black holes groups had been inferred with gravitational wave data since 2022 and then interpreted as the signature of the PISN mass gap, here we report the emergence of a new group of low-spin but massive ($\sim 50-70M_\odot$) black holes, which are hard to produce via hierarchical mergers, in the latest GWTC-4.0 data. Correspondingly, the mass cutoff of the low-spin black holes shifts to $68.5^{+19.8}_{-18.5}M_\odot$ ($90\%$ credibility), which is consistent with the PISN model for a low $^{12}C(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}O$ reaction rate of $S_{300{\rm keV}} \sim 110~{\rm keV~b}$. Despite that the massive single-star collapse/dynamical capture origin can not be reliably tested at this moment, a high pair-instability mass cutoff $M_{\rm low}\sim 70M_\odot$ may be favored for its capability of accounting for the rather low observation rate of hydrogen-less super-luminous supernovae.

**Abstract**: Superradiant scattering of electromagnetic fields from ringing black holes Rajesh Karmakar, Debaprasad Maity 16 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, Published version in EPJC General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Detection of gravitational waves (GWs) paves the beginning of a new era of gravitational wave astronomy. Black holes (BHs) in their ringdown phase provide the cleanest signal of emitted GWs that imprint the fundamental nature of BHs under low energy perturbation. Apart from GWs, any complementary signature of ringing BHs can be of paramount importance. Motivated by this we analyzed the scattering of electromagnetic waves in such a background and demonstrated that the absorption cross section of a ringing Schwarzschild BH can be superradiant. Moreover, we have found out that such superradiant phenomena are transient in nature with a characteristic time scale equal to the GW oscillation time scale. We further point out that the existing ground-based Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), radio telescopes, may be able to detect such transient signals from BHs of mass range $M\sim 10^{-1} - 10^{-2} M_{\odot}$, which should necessarily be of primordial origin. Our present result opens up an intriguing possibility of observing the black hole merging phenomena through electromagnetic waves.

This tidal dissipation generally affects the gravitational waveform, and measuring the TDNs of a black hole (BH) allows us to test the nature of gravity in the strong-field regime. In this paper, we develop a parametrized formalism for calculating the TDNs of static and spherically symmetric BH backgrounds using the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi method, which connects the underlying perturbative equations with observable quantities in gravitational-wave observations in a theory-agnostic manner. Our formalism applies to any system where the master equation has the form of the Regge-Wheeler/Zerilli equation with a small correction to the effective potential. As an application of our formalism, we consider three examples: the effective field theory of BH perturbations with timelike scalar profile, the Einstein-Maxwell system, and a higher-curvature extension of general relativity. We also discuss the absence of logarithmic running for the TDNs.

## 15. Muffled Murmurs: Environmental effects in the LISA stochastic signal from stellar-mass black hole binaries

**Abstract**: Muffled Murmurs: Environmental effects in the LISA stochastic signal from stellar-mass black hole binaries Ran Chen, Rohit S. Chandramouli, Federico Pozzoli, Riccardo Buscicchio, Enrico Barausse Phys. Rev. D 112, 084053 (2025) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The population of unresolved stellar-mass black hole binaries (sBBHs) is expected to produce a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) potentially detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). In this work, we compute the imprint of astrophysical environmental effect--such as gas dynamical friction and accretion--on this background. Using the sBBHs population constraints obtained by the LIGO--Virgo--Kagra collaboration, we compute the expected SGWB and develop a phenomenological parametric model that can accurately capture the effect of dynamical friction and accretion. Using our model, we perform Bayesian inference on simulated signals to assess the detectability of these environmental effects. We find that even for large injected values of the Eddington ratio, the effect of accretion in the SGWB is undetectable by LISA. However, LISA will be able to constrain the effect of dynamical friction with an upper bound on the gas density of $\rho \lesssim 7.6 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{g \, cm^{-3}}$, thus probing the sBBH environment forming in typical thin accretion disks around Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). For injected densities of $\rho \sim 10^{-10}-10^{-9} \mathrm{g} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, dynamical friction effects can be well measured and clearly distinguished from vacuum, with Bayes factors reaching up to $\sim$ 60, even when the Galactic foreground is included.

Scheel 21 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables; v2 changes to match published version including addition of App. B General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) The study of unbound binary-black-hole encounters provides a gauge-invariant approach to exploring strong-field gravitational interactions in two-body systems, which can subsequently inform waveform models for bound orbits. In this work, we present 60 new highly accurate numerical relativity (NR) simulations of black-hole scattering, generated using the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC). Our simulations include 14 spin-aligned configurations, as well as 16 configurations with unequal masses, up to a mass ratio of 10. We perform the first direct comparison of scattering angles computed using different NR codes, finding good agreement. We compare our NR scattering angle results to the post-Minkowskian (PM)-based effective-one-body (EOB) closed-form models SEOB-PM and $w_{\rm EOB}$, finding less than 5% deviation except near the scatter-capture separatrix. Comparisons with the post-Newtonian-based EOB evolution models SEOBNRv5 and TEOBResumS-Dal√≠ reveal that the former agrees within 8% accuracy with non-spinning NR results across most parameter ranges, whereas the latter matches similarly at lower energies but diverges significantly at higher energies. Both evolution EOB models exhibit increased deviations for spinning systems, predicting a notably different location of the capture separatrix compared to NR. Our key result is the first measurement of disparate scattering angles from NR simulations due to asymmetric gravitational-wave emission. We compare these results to SEOB-PM models constructed to calculate the scattering angle of a single black hole in asymmetric systems.

**Abstract**: Eikonal quasinormal modes of highly-spinning black holes in higher-curvature gravity: a window into extremality Pablo A. Cano, Marina David, Guido van der Velde 43 pages, 7 figures; v2: references added General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We carry out the first computation of gravitational quasinormal modes of black holes with arbitrary rotation in a theory with higher-derivative corrections. Our analysis focuses on a recently identified quartic-curvature theory that preserves the isospectrality of quasinormal modes in the eikonal limit and that is connected to string theory. We find a master equation that governs large-momentum gravitational perturbations in this theory. By solving this equation with WKB methods, we provide complete results for the corrections to the Kerr quasinormal mode frequencies for arbitrary spin and arbitrary $\mu=m/(\ell+1/2)$, where $\ell$ and $m$ are the harmonic numbers. Our results show that the corrections become orders of magnitude larger when the spin is close to extremality, with the modes close to the critical value of $\mu$ that separates damped and zero-damped modes being particularly sensitive. We also perform a geometric-optics analysis of gravitational-wave propagation around black holes and relate the equatorial ``graviton-sphere'' orbits to quasinormal mode frequencies with $\ell=m$. We find that the usual correspondence between the Lyapunov exponent of those orbits and the imaginary part of the frequency is modified.

**Abstract**: GWKokab: An Implementation to Identify the Properties of Multiple Population of Gravitational Wave Sources Meesum Qazalbash, Muhammad Zeeshan, Richard O'Shaughnessy General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The rapidly increasing sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors is enabling the detection of a growing number of compact binary mergers. These events are crucial for understanding the population properties of compact binaries. However, many previous studies rely on computationally expensive inference frameworks, limiting their scalability. In this work, we present GWKokab, a JAX-based framework that enables modular model building with independent rate for each subpopulation such as BBH, BNS, and NSBH binaries. It provides accelerated inference using the normalizing flow based sampler called flowMC and is also compatible with NumPyro samplers. To validate our framework, we generated two synthetic populations, one comprising spinning eccentric binaries and the other circular binaries using a multi-source model. We then recovered their injected parameters at significantly reduced computational cost and demonstrated that eccentricity distribution can be recovered even in spinning eccentric populations. We also reproduced results from two prior studies: one on non-spinning eccentric populations, and another on the BBH mass distribution using the third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). We anticipate that GWKokab will not only reduce computational costs but also enable more detailed subpopulation analyses such as their mass, spin, eccentricity, and redshift distributions in gravitational wave events, offering deeper insights into compact binary formation and evolution.

**Abstract**: Gravitomagnetic-Hydrodynamics and Turbulence in Early Universe Jiaxiang Liang, Peng Xu, Minghui Du, Yifu Cheng, Zhan Wang, Ziren Luo, Manjia Liang General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The nonlinear coupling between spacetime geometry and matter in the early Universe remains a frontier in theoretical cosmology. By introducing a novel gravitomagnetic-hydrodynamic framework, we reveal a fundamental analogy between magnetohydrodynamics and the co-evolution of spacetime geometry and relativistic plasma. We demonstrate that, in high-energy environments such as the electroweak phase transition, the (newly defined) gravitomagnetic Reynolds number becomes large, signifying a strongly coupled system where the gravitomagnetic field could be frozen into the fluid. This coupling inevitably leads to the emergence of gravitational Alfv√©n waves and could drive a transition to turbulence involving the dynamics of spacetime itself. Our findings suggest that gravitomagnetic-hydrodynamic turbulence may leave imprints on the stochastic gravitational wave background, offering a new window into the nonlinear dynamics of the primordial Universe.

**Abstract**: The Route to Unveil the Cosmic Genealogy of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Using Nano-Hertz Gravitational Waves and Galaxy Surveys Mohit Raj Sah, Suvodip Mukherjee 23 pages, 16 figures. Accepted for publication in ApJ Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The nano-hertz (nHz) stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), generated by unresolved supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), provides a unique probe of their population and its cosmic evolution. In this work, we explore the potential of uncovering the SMBHB population and its redshift dependence by combining the SGWB signal and its anisotropies with galaxy distribution through cross-correlation analyses. Using a Fisher analysis technique, we show that the SGWB power spectrum alone can not provide any information on the evolutionary history of SMBHBs, whereas the inclusion of the angular power spectrum of the SGWB and its cross-correlation with the galaxy distribution substantially improves constraints on the redshift evolution parameters. Assuming pulsar timing array (PTA) configurations achievable in the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) era, we find that the combined use of isotropic and anisotropic SGWB signals, together with galaxy surveys, can provide valuable measurements of the redshift evolution of the SMBH-galaxy connection and the frequency distribution of SMBHBs. These results highlight the potential of joint GW-galaxy studies to address the long-standing open question of SMBH growth and evolution across cosmic time.

**Abstract**: Higher-derivative Heterotic Kerr-Sen Black Holes Peng-Ju Hu, Liang Ma, Yi Pang, Robert J. Saskowski 47 pages, 1 figure; Mathematica file included High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph) We obtain the four-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution in heterotic supergravity, which includes the Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger solution as a limiting case. In particular, we first embed the Kerr solution into heterotic supergravity and compute the higher-derivative corrections. We then obtain the corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution by performing an $O(2,1)$ boost of the Kerr solution, which, in contrast to the two-derivative case, requires field redefinitions to make the $O(2,1)$ invariance of the action manifest. Finally, we compute the multipole moments and find that they are distinct from those of the Kerr solution at the four-derivative level. We also find that the multipole moments are distinct from those of the Kerr-Newman solution in Einstein-Maxwell theory at the four-derivative level, even for the most general choice of four-derivative corrections. This gives a way to experimentally distinguish traces of string theory in gravitational wave data.

First, we obtain the generic phase diagram of possible mass-radius relation forms for the HybQSs. Then, utilizing a well-established general parameterization of interacting quark matter, we construct quark star models featuring sharp first-order quark-quark phase transitions of various types, in contrast to the hadron-quark transition in conventional hybrid stars. We systematically investigate how recent observations, such as the pulsar mass measurement $M_{\rm TOV}\gtrsim2M_{\odot}$ and the GW170817's tidal deformability bound $\Lambda_{1.4M_{\odot}}<800$, constrain the viable parameter space. We also identified twin stars in some of the HybQS parameter space. Furthermore, we found that the quark-quark phase transitions in hybrid quark stars may also cause the deviation from the approximate universal relation between the dominant postmerger frequency $f_{\rm peak}$ and tidal deformability $\Lambda_{1.35M_{\odot}}$, which was previously believed to only be caused by the hadron-quark phase transitions in hybrid neutron stars. This work unveils new possibilities of phase transitions and the resulting new types of compact stars in realistic astrophysical scenarios.

CHRONOS combines a ring-cavity Sagnac interferometer with torsion-bar test masses to realize the first quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of angular momentum in a macroscopic system. By implementing a speed-meter readout in the rotational degree of freedom, CHRONOS coherently cancels quantum radiation-pressure noise and enables sub-Hz observations. We show that detuned power recycling and cavity-length optimization can simultaneously relax technical requirements on both torsion bars and speed meters. Assuming a realistic optical design with a 1m torsion bar, we estimate strain sensitivities of $h \simeq 1 \times 10^{-18}\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1Hz for detectors with arm lengths of 2.5m, 40m, and 300m. These sensitivities enable (i) direct detection of intermediate-mass black hole binaries up to 380Mpc with ${\rm SNR}=3$, (ii) probing stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds down to $\Omega_{\rm GW} \sim 3.2 \times 10^{-9}$ at 0.2Hz with 5yr accumulation. Furthermore, CHRONOS enables prompt detection of gravity-gradient signals from magnitude-5.5 earthquakes even with a 2.5m prototype. CHRONOS thus opens new opportunities for quantum-limited geophysical observation and multi-band, multi-messenger gravitational-wave astronomy.

Department of Physics, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong SAR, China Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Recent pulsar timing array results, including the NANOGrav 15-year data set, show evidence for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB) in the nanohertz band. We present a Bayesian framework to compare three possible origins: (i) a background from supermassive black hole binary mergers, (ii) a first-order phase transition in the early Universe, and (iii) a network of cosmic strings. We derive the PTA likelihood with the Hellings-Downs angular correlation and model intrinsic pulsar red noise and dispersion-measure variations. Using Bayesian model selection, we infer posteriors for the GWB amplitude and spectral slope and compute marginal likelihoods for each scenario. We confirm a common-spectrum process with Hellings-Downs spatial correlations and recover a characteristic strain amplitude at f_yr = 1/year of A_GWB approx 2.4e-15, with a slope consistent with gamma approx 13/3 as expected for supermassive black hole binaries. While fully consistent with an astrophysical origin, cosmological sources are not excluded: cosmic strings with Gmu ~ 1e-11 to 1e-10 and phase transitions peaking near 1e-8 to 1e-7 Hz can reproduce the observed amplitude within allowed parameter ranges. Current Bayes factors do not show a decisive preference among these scenarios. We discuss noise-mitigation implications and prospects for discrimination with future PTA observations.

**Abstract**: Bubble wall velocity with out-of-equilibrium corrections Carlo Branchina, Angela Conaci, Stefania De Curtis, Luigi Delle Rose High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We study how out-of-equilibrium effects modify the steady-state propagation of bubble walls during a cosmological first-order electroweak phase transition. Going beyond the local thermal equilibrium approximation, we numerically solve the coupled system of scalar field, hydrodynamic and Boltzmann equations using a spectral algorithm that allows a first-principle treatment of the collision integral. This approach enables a quantitative assessment of non-equilibrium perturbations in the plasma and their backreaction on the wall motion. Focusing on the singlet extension of the Standard Model as a minimal benchmark scenario, we find that out-of-equilibrium corrections substantially enhance the effective friction on the expanding front, leading to slower wall velocities and broader wall profiles compared to the equilibrium case. These modifications have significant implications for cosmological observables. For instance, they enhance the efficiency of electroweak baryogenesis, thus improving the viability of baryon asymmetry generation within realistic parameter regions that can also be probed by future gravitational wave interferometers.

**Abstract**: Multivariate Time Series Classification of Fermi-Detected Gamma-Ray Transients Using Convolutional-Recurrent Neural Networks Arpan Aryam John, Krushna Govind Shete, Shabnam Iyyani, Saptarshi Bej 19 pages, 11 Figures, under review High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has detected a diverse range of gamma-ray transients since its launch in 2008. Over the years, Fermi has accumulated an extensive public archive of transient events. Traditional classification methods for these events typically rely on fixed thresholds, localisation accuracy, and characteristic light curve features. However, in the current era of time-critical, multi-wavelength, and multi-messenger astronomy, rapid and reliable classification is essential to enable timely follow-up and coordinated observations. In this work, we develop and present two deep learning-based classifiers that integrate convolutional and recurrent neural network architectures. Using multivariate time-series inputs derived from Fermi-GBM data, our models are trained to distinguish among four classes of gamma-ray transients: Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs), Solar Flares (SFLAREs), and Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs). Furthermore, the models are designed to flag events that do not conform to any of these categories, providing a pathway for identifying potentially new or rare transient types. Training was conducted using a carefully curated subset of high-confidence Fermi events. The resulting models achieve an overall classification accuracy of 93%, and identify approximately 2.5% of the triggers as outliers of unknown origin. When applied to Fermi events with uncertain classifications, our models assign 60% of them to the TGF category with over 60% confidence. These results demonstrate that incorporating deep learning-based classification into onboard or automated data pipelines can significantly enhance transient identification, minimize misclassification, and improve the discovery potential of new phenomena in future high-energy astrophysics missions.

## 27. Luminosity Functions and Detectability of Binary Neutron Star Merger-nova Signals with Various Merger Remnants

**Abstract**: Luminosity Functions and Detectability of Binary Neutron Star Merger-nova Signals with Various Merger Remnants Zhiwei Chen, Youjun Lu, Hao Ma, Qingbo Chu 17 pages, 13 figures, accepted by MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) With the rapid advancements in next-generation ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors, it is anticipated that $10^3$-$10^5$ binary neutron star (BNS) mergers per year will be detected, with a significant fraction accompanied by observable merger-nova signals through future sky surveys. Merger-novae are typically powered by the radioactive decay of heavy elements synthesized via the r-process. If the post-merger remnant is a long-lived rapid-rotating neutron star, the merger-nova can be significantly enhanced due to strong magnetized winds. In this paper, we generate mock BNS merger samples using binary population synthesis model and classify their post-merger remnants--black hole (BH) and magnetar, (i.e., long-lived supramassive NS and stable NS), based on results from numerical simulations. We then construct merger-nova radiation models to estimate their luminosity function. We find that the luminosity function may exhibit a distinctive triple-peak structure, with the relative positions and heights of these peaks depending on the equation of state (EOS) of the BNS. Furthermore, we estimate the average Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) detection efficiency $\langle f_{\rm eff} \rangle$ with the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) and find that due to possible enhanced luminosity, the largest source redshift with $\langle f_{\rm eff} \rangle>0.1$ can be enlarged from $z_{\rm s}\sim 0.5$ to $z_{\rm s}\sim 1-1.5$. Besides, we also generate the detectable mass spectrum for merger-novae by $\langle f_{\rm eff}\rangle$, which may provide insights to the ToO searching strategy.

Hristov, Daniel Kocevski, Niccol√≤ Di Lalla, Stephen Lesage, Bagrat Mailyan, Eliza Neights, Nicola Omodei, Oliver J. Roberts, Lorenzo Scotton, Dmitry S. Svinkin, Joshua Wood High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Magnetar giant flares (MGFs) are rare, extremely bright bursts of gamma-rays from highly magnetized neutron stars. These events are challenging to identify because, at extragalactic distances, they can appear similar to other astrophysical phenomena. Only a handful have been confidently identified to date, limiting our understanding of their origin and physical properties. This study focuses on expanding the sample of known events and enabling a more detailed characterization of their observational features and intrinsic properties, while introducing significant improvements in the methods used to identify and analyze them. When applied to archival data from the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on the \Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, this approach added four previously unidentified events the known sample, expanding the total to 13 MGFs. This demonstrates both the effectiveness of the method and the likelihood that additional MGFs remain hidden in existing gamma-ray burst catalogs. We utilize this expanded sample to gain a deeper understanding of the broader population of MGFs. We develop a statistical modeling framework that combines previously considered data with modern observations from Fermi/GBM. The model accounts for instrumental sensitivity and the expected diversity in event characteristics. We infer a volumetric rate of events above $1.2\times10^{44}\,\rm{erg}$ of $R_{MGF}=5.5^{+4.5}_{-2.7}\times10^5\rm{Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$. The results show that individual magnetars must produce multiple flares throughout their lifetimes, reinforcing the idea that these are recurring phenomena rather than singular explosive events. Expanding the sample of known MGFs improves our understanding of magnetars and their role in other astrophysical phenomena, including possible links to fast radio bursts, gravitational waves, and the creation of heavy elements in extreme astrophysical environments.

**Abstract**: Learning and Interpreting Gravitational-Wave Features from CNNs with a Random Forest Approach Jun Tian, He Wang, Jibo He, Yu Pan, Shuo Cao, Qingquan Jiang 2025 Mach. Learn.: Sci. Technol. 6 035045 Machine Learning (cs.LG); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an) Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become widely adopted in gravitational wave (GW) detection pipelines due to their ability to automatically learn hierarchical features from raw strain data. However, the physical meaning of these learned features remains underexplored, limiting the interpretability of such models. In this work, we propose a hybrid architecture that combines a CNN-based feature extractor with a random forest (RF) classifier to improve both detection performance and interpretability. Unlike prior approaches that directly connect classifiers to CNN outputs, our method introduces four physically interpretable metrics - variance, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), waveform overlap, and peak amplitude - computed from the final convolutional layer. These are jointly used with the CNN output in the RF classifier to enable more informed decision boundaries. Tested on long-duration strain datasets, our hybrid model outperforms a baseline CNN model, achieving a relative improvement of 21\% in sensitivity at a fixed false alarm rate of 10 events per month. Notably, it also shows improved detection of low-SNR signals (SNR $\le$ 10), which are especially vulnerable to misclassification in noisy environments. Feature attribution via the RF model reveals that both CNN-extracted and handcrafted features contribute significantly to classification decisions, with learned variance and CNN outputs ranked among the most informative. These findings suggest that physically motivated post-processing of CNN feature maps can serve as a valuable tool for interpretable and efficient GW detection, bridging the gap between deep learning and domain knowledge.

**Abstract**: Breaking boundaries: extending the orbit-averaged Fokker-Planck equation inside the loss cone Luca Broggi 9 pages, 3 figures, submitted to PRL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) In this Letter, we present a new formulation of loss cone theory as a reaction-diffusion system, which accounts for loss cone events through a sink term and can be orbit-averaged. It can recover the standard approach based on boundary conditions, and is derived from a simple physical model that overcomes many of the classical theoretical constraints. We test our formulation by computing the relaxed distribution of disruptive orbits in phase space, that has a simple analytic form and agrees with the pericentre of tidal disruption events at disruption predicted by non-averaged models. This formulation of the problem is particularly suitable for including more physics in tidal disruptions and the analogous problem of gravitational captures, e.g. strong scatterings, gravitational waves emission, physical stellar collisions, and repeating partial disruptions -- that can all act on timescale shorter than two-body relaxation and might cause the tension between the observed vs theoretically predicted population of tidal disruptions.

Rev. D 112, 083051 (2025) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an) Detecting continuous gravitational waves (CWs) is challenging due to their weak amplitude and high computational demands, especially with poorly constrained source parameters. Stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) searches using cross-correlation techniques can identify unresolved astrophysical sources, including CWs, at lower computational cost, albeit with reduced sensitivity. This motivates a hybrid approach where SGWB algorithms act as a first-pass filter to identify CW candidates for follow-up with dedicated CW pipelines. We evaluated the discovery potential of the SGWB analysis tool PyStoch for detecting CWs, using simulated signals from spinning down NSs. We then applied the method to data from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O3), covering the (20-1726) Hz frequency band, and targeting four supernova remnants: Vela Jr., G347.3-0.5, Cassiopeia A, and the NS associated with the 1987A supernova remnant. If necessary, significant candidates are followed up using the 5-vector Resampling and Band-Sampled Data Frequency-Hough techniques. However, since no interesting candidates were identified in the real O3 analysis, we set 95\% confidence-level upper limits on the CW strain amplitude $h_0$. The most stringent limit was obtained for Cassiopeia A, and is $h_0 = 1.13 \times 10^{-25}$ at $201.57$ Hz with a frequency resolution of $1/32$ Hz. As for the other targets, the best upper limits have been set with the same frequency resolution, and correspond to $h_0 = 1.20 \times 10^{-25} $ at $202.16$ Hz for G347.3-0.5, $1.20 \times 10^{-25}$ at $217.81$ Hz for Vela Jr., and $1.47 \times 10^{-25}$ at $186.41$ Hz for the NS in the 1987A supernova remnant.

Williams Accepted to ApJL. 37 pages, 12 figures High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Kilonovae, the ultraviolet/optical/infrared counterparts to binary neutron star mergers, are an exceptionally rare class of transients. Optical follow-up campaigns are plagued by contaminating transients, which may mimic kilonovae, but do not receive sufficient observations to measure the full photometric evolution. In this work, we present an analysis of the multi-wavelength dataset of supernova (SN) 2025ulz, a proposed kilonova candidate following the low-significance detection of gravitational waves originating from the potential binary neutron star merger S250818k. Despite an early rapid decline in brightness, our multi-wavelength observations of SN 2025ulz reveal that it is a type IIb supernova. As part of this analysis, we demonstrate the capabilities of a novel quantitative scoring algorithm to determine the likelihood that a transient candidate is a kilonova, based primarily on its 3D location and light curve evolution. We also apply our scoring algorithm to other transient candidates in the localization volume of S250818k and find that, at all times after the discovery of SN 2025ulz, there are $\geq 4$ candidates with a score comparable to SN 2025ulz, indicating that the kilonova search may have benefited from the additional follow-up of other candidates. During future kilonova searches, this type of scoring algorithm will be useful to rule out contaminating transients in real time, optimizing the use of valuable telescope resources.
