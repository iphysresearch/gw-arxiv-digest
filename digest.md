**Abstract**: Exact solution of the DeWitt-Brehme-Hobbs equation in copropagating electromagetic and gravitational waves Giulio Audagnotto, Antonino Di Piazza General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) An accelerated charge interacts with itself through the electromagnetic field that it sources, a phenomenon known as electromagnetic radiation reaction. The DeWitt-Brehme-Hobbs (DWBH) equation describes the motion of a charged mass in the presence of combined electromagnetic and gravitational fields, taking into account electromagnetic radiation-reaction effects. Here, we find the first exact analytical solution of the DWBH equation in the case of a charged mass in the presence of copropagating and otherwise arbitrary electromagnetic and gravitational plane waves. Apart from its intrinsic importance, this solution approximates that of an ultrarelativistic particle in arbitrary gravitational and electromagnetic fields. Finally, the paradigmatic example of a sinusoidal electro-magnetic wave in the presence of a constant-amplitude gravitational wave is worked out explicitly and it shows how the presence of the gravitational wave can qualitatively change electromagnetic radiation-reaction effects.

**Abstract**: Ringdown mode amplitudes of charged binary black holes Zexin Hu, Daniela D. Doneva, Ziming Wang, Vasileios Paschalidis, Gabriele Bozzola, Stoytcho S. Yazadjiev, Lijing Shao General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The ringdown phase of the binary black hole (BBH) merger provides a clean and direct probe of strong-field gravity and tests of the nature of black holes. The quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies in modified gravity theories, as well as their amplitudes and phases, might deviate from the Kerr ones in general relativity. Charged black holes (BHs) in Einstein-Maxwell theory provide an excellent example of a beyond-Kerr solution with direct astrophysical and fundamental physics applications. In this work, we extract the ringdown mode amplitudes and phases for charged BBH mergers based on fully general relativistic simulations with charge-to-mass ratio up to 0.3. Our results suggest that even though the inspiral phase of charged BBHs can be significantly accelerated or decelerated, the ringdown mode excitation only changes mildly. We further explore the charge detectability with the ringdown-only signal for the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. We find that previous studies may have overestimated the charge detectability and including higher modes in charged waveforms is necessary for future ringdown analysis. This constitutes the first such analysis based on waveforms generated by numerical relativity simulations of charged BHs in full Einstein-Maxwell theory.

**Abstract**: The bound orbits and gravitational waveforms of timelike particles around renormalization group improved Kerr black holes Yong-Zhuang Li, Xiao-Mei Kuang 15 pages,12 figures, comments and suggestions are welcome General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this article, we investigate the bound orbits of the timelike particles and the gravitational waveforms emitted from these orbits around a renormalization group improved Kerr black hole in the framework of the asymptotic safety approach. The running Newton coupling in the metric is characterized by two free quantum parameters $(\omega,\,\gamma)$ arsing from the non-perturbative renormalization group theory and the appropriate cutoff identification, respectively. As expected, the radii of the horizon, the marginally bound orbits and the innermost stable orbit are all decrease as the quantum parameters increase. Under the extreme mass-ratio inspirals approximation the deviation of gravitational waveforms radiated by the periodic orbits from those in the classical Kerr background increases with the two quantum parameter. However, this effect is much smaller in the retrograde case compared to the prograde case. Especially, by comparing the characteristic strain of those gravitational wave with the sensitivity curve of several potential detectors, we find that their characteristic frequencies can fall within the sensitivity ranges of several planned gravitational wave observatories, suggesting that such signals may be detectable with sufficient instrumental sensitivity.

**Abstract**: GW230814: investigation of a loud gravitational-wave signal observed with a single detector The LIGO Scientific Collaboration, The Virgo Collaboration, The Kagra Collaboration, Others As part of the Astrophysical Journal Letters Focus Issue on the Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) GW230814 was detected by the LIGO Livingston observatory with a signal-to-noise ratio of 42.4 making it the loudest gravitational-wave signal in the GWTC-4.0 catalog. The source is consistent with a binary black hole coalescence similar to those in the previously observed population, with component masses $m_1 = 33.7^{+2.9}_{-2.2}$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$, $m_2 = 28.2^{+2.2}_{-3.1} M_\odot$, and small effective inspiral spin $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}= -0.01^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$. The high signal-to-noise ratio enabled us to confidently detect an $\ell = |m| = 4$ mode in the inspiral signal for the first time, and enables a range of tests of consistency between theoretical predictions and the observed waveform. Most of these tests show good agreement with expectations from general relativity. However, a few indicate deviations, particularly in the ringdown part of the signal. We find that deviations comparable to those observed can be obtained from similar simulated signals based on general relativity and detector noise effects. Therefore, the apparent deviations do not provide evidence for a violation of general relativity. The observation of GW230814 demonstrates that while the unprecedented sensitivity of the detectors enable highly significant detections with a single observatory, drawing robust inferences about fundamental physics remains limited without data from a multiple observatory network.

## 5. Directed searches for gravitational waves from ultralight vector boson clouds around merger remnant and galactic black holes during the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run

**Abstract**: Directed searches for gravitational waves from ultralight vector boson clouds around merger remnant and galactic black holes during the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run The LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration, the KAGRA Collaboration General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We present the first directed searches for long-transient and continuous gravitational waves from ultralight vector boson clouds around known black holes (BHs). We use LIGO data from the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run. The searches target two distinct types of BHs and use two new semicoherent methods: hidden Markov model (HMM) tracking for the remnant BHs of the mergers GW230814_230901 and GW231123_135430 (referred to as GW230814 and GW231123 in this study), and a dedicated method using the Band Sampled Data (BSD) framework for the galactic BH in the Cygnus X-1 binary system. Without finding evidence of a signal from vector bosons in the data, we estimate the mass range that can be constrained. For the HMM searches targeting the remnants from GW231123 and GW230814, we disfavor vector boson masses in the ranges $[0.94, 1.08]$ and $[2.75, 3.28] \times 10^{-13}$ eV, respectively, at 30% confidence, assuming a 1% false alarm probability. Although these searches are only marginally sensitive to signals from merger remnants at relatively large distances, future observations are expected to yield more stringent constraints with high confidence. For the BSD search targeting the BH in Cygnus X-1, we exclude vector boson masses in the range $[0.85, 1.59] \times 10^{-13}$ eV at 95% confidence, assuming an initial BH spin larger than 0.5.

## 6. Covariant Carrollian Electric and Magnetic Limits of General Relativity

**Abstract**: Covariant Carrollian Electric and Magnetic Limits of General Relativity Tanmay Patil, S. Shankaranarayanan (IIT Bombay) 39 Pages, 1 Table; Comments welcome General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) The Carrollian limit ($c \to 0$) of General Relativity provides the geometric language for describing null hypersurfaces, such as black hole event horizons and null infinity. Motivated by the well-established electric and magnetic limits of Galilean electromagnetism, we perform a systematic analysis of the low-velocity limit of linearized gravity to derive its Carrollian counterparts. Using a 1+3 covariant decomposition, we study the transformation properties of linear tensor perturbations (gravitational waves) on a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker background under Carrollian boosts. We demonstrate that, analogous to the electromagnetic case, the full set of linearized Einstein's equations is not Carrollian-invariant. Instead, the theory bifurcates into two distinct and consistent frameworks: a Carrollian Electric Limit and a Carrollian Magnetic Limit. In the electric limit, dynamics are frozen, leaving a static theory of tidal forces ($E_{ab}$) constrained by the matter distribution. In contrast, the Magnetic Limit yields a consistent dynamical theory where the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor ($H_{ab}$), which governs gravito-magnetic and radiative effects, remains well-defined and is sourced by the spacetime shear. This framework resolves ambiguities in defining Carrollian gravity and provides a robust theory for gravito-magnetic dynamics in ultra-relativistic regimes. Our results have direct implications for the study of black hole horizons, gravitational memory, and the holographic principle.

## 7. Anatomy of parameter-estimation biases in overlapping gravitational-wave signals: detector network

**Abstract**: Anatomy of parameter-estimation biases in overlapping gravitational-wave signals: detector network Ziming Wang, Dicong Liang, Lijing Shao General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) With the significantly improved sensitivity and a wider frequency band, the next-generation gravitational-wave (GW) detectors are anticipated to detect $\sim 10^5$ GW signals per year with durations from hours to days, leading to inevitable signal overlaps in the data stream. While a direct fitting for all signals is infeasible, extracting only one signal will be biased by its overlap with other signals. From this perspective, understanding how the biases arise from the overlapping and their dependence on the signal parameters is crucial for developing effective algorithms. In this work, we extend the anatomy of biases in single-detector cases to a detector network. Specifically, we focus on the bias dependence on the sky location, polarization and inclination angles, as well as the coalescence time and phase. We propose a new quantity, named the bias integral, as a useful tool, and establish relationship between the biases in a single detector and that in the entire network, with explicit dependence on extrinsic parameters. Using a 3-detector network as an example, we further explore the potential of a network to suppress biases due to the detectors' different locations and orientations. We find that location generally has a smaller effect than orientation, and becomes significant only when the time separation between signals is below sub-seconds. Through a population-level simulation over the extrinsic parameters, we find that nearly half of overlapping signals will lead to larger biases in the network compared to a single detector, highlighting the need to cope with overlapping biases in a detector network.

## 8. Is GW190521 a gravitational wave echo of wormhole remnant from another universe?

**Abstract**: Is GW190521 a gravitational wave echo of wormhole remnant from another universe? Qi Lai, Qing-Yu Lan, Hao-Yang Liu, Yu-Tong Wang, Yun-Song Piao 16 pages, 4 figures and 3 tables General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) A particularly compelling aspect of the GW190521 event detected by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration is that it has an extremely short duration, and lacks a clearly identifiable inspiral phase usually observed in the binary black holes (BBHs) coalescence. In this work, we hypothesize that GW190521 might represent a single, isolated gravitational wave (GW) echo pulse from the wormhole, which is the postmerger remnant of BBHs in another universe and connected to our universe through a throat. The ringdown signal after BBHs merged in another universe can pass through the throat of wormhole and be detected in our universe as a short-duration echo pulse. Our analysis results indicate that our model yields a network signal-to-noise ratio comparable to that of the standard BBHs merger model reported by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration. Though the Bayesian factor slightly prefers the standard BBHs merger model, it is not significant enough to rule out the possibility that the echo-for-wormhole model is a viable hypothesis for the GW190521 event.

**Abstract**: Observing Double White Dwarfs with the Lunar GW Antenna Giovanni Benetti, Marica Branchesi, Jan Harms, Jean-Pierre Zendri 16 pages, 10 figures. Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna (LGWA) is a proposed gravitational-wave detector that will observe in the decihertz (dHz) frequency region. In this band, binary white dwarf systems are expected to merge, emitting gravitational waves. Detecting this emission opens new perspectives for understanding the Type Ia supernova progenitors and for investigating dense matter physics. In this work, we present the capabilities of LGWA to detect and localize short-period double white dwarfs in terms of sky locations and distances. The analysis is performed using a realistic spatial distribution of sources, merger rates, and binary-mass distributions derived from current population synthesis models. The simulated population of double white dwarfs is generated using the SeBa stellar-evolution code, coupled with dedicated sampling algorithms. The performance of the LGWA detector, both in terms of signal detectability and parameter estimation, is assessed using standard gravitational-wave data analysis techniques, including Fisher matrix methods, as implemented in the GWFish and Legwork codes. The analysis indicates that LGWA could detect approximately O(30) monochromatic galactic sources and O(10) extragalactic mergers, demonstrating the unique potential of decihertz gravitational-wave detectors to access and characterize extragalactic DWD populations. This will open new avenues for understanding Type Ia supernova progenitors and the physics of DWDs.

## 10. Dynamical Dark Energy or Modified Gravity? Signatures in Gravitational Wave Propagation

**Abstract**: Dynamical Dark Energy or Modified Gravity? Signatures in Gravitational Wave Propagation Purnendu Karmakar, Sandeep Haridasu General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We discuss the implications of the most recent DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) DR2 and DESyr5 compilation of supernovae (SNe) datasets for modified gravity focusing on non-metricity based $f(Q)$ theory, by employing a `model-independent' approach. We reconstruct of dark energy density which is then extended to estimate the perturbation-level quantities, sourced by the modified gravity, namely the effective gravitational coupling, $\mu$, and the amplitude damping parameter of gravitational wave propagation, $\nu$. In light of the remarkable hints for a dynamical dark energy emerging from the analysis of background cosmological data, we discuss the possibility to distinguish between dark energy and modified gravity scenarios from their scalar and tensor perturbation-level signatures. We contrast our findings between the older Pantheon+ and the newer DESyr5 compilations of SNe datasets, which predict a significant distinct signature in the damping parameter of the gravitational wave propagation amplitude. On the other hand, the prediction for the effective gravitational coupling remains insensitive to the choice of the SNe datasets. Our results provide a strong case for the study of gravitational wave propagation in modified gravity theories, in light of the new generation of gravitational wave detectors such as LISA, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.

## 11. Mapping the Gravitational-wave Background Across the Spectrum with a Next-Generation Anisotropic Per-frequency Optimal Statistic

**Abstract**: Mapping the Gravitational-wave Background Across the Spectrum with a Next-Generation Anisotropic Per-frequency Optimal Statistic Kyle A. Gersbach, Stephen R. Taylor, Bence B√©csy, Anna-Malin Lemke, Andrea Mitridate, Nihan Pol Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) With pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) having observed a gravitational wave background (GWB) at nanohertz frequencies, the focus of the field is shifting towards determining and characterizing its origin. While the primary candidate is a population of GW-emitting supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), many other cosmological processes could produce a GWB with similar spectral properties as have been measured. One key argument to help differentiate an SMBHB GWB from a cosmologically sourced one is its level of anisotropy; a GWB sourced by a finite population will likely exhibit greater anisotropy than a cosmological GWB through finite source effects (``shot noise'') and potentially large-scale structure. Current PTA GWB anisotropy detection methods often use the frequentist PTA optimal statistic for its fast estimation of pulsar pair correlations and relatively low computational overhead compared to spatially-correlated Bayesian analyses. However, there are critical limitations with the status quo approach. In this paper, we improve this technique by incorporating three recent advancements: accounting for covariance between pulsar pairwise estimates of correlated GWB power; the per-frequency optimal statistic to dissect the GWB across the spectrum; and constructing null-hypothesis statistical distributions that include cosmic variance. By combining these methods, our new pipeline can localize GWB anisotropies to specific frequencies, through which anisotropy detection prospects -- while impacted by cosmic variance -- are shown to improve in our simulations from a $p$-value of $\sim0.2$ in a broadband search to $\sim0.01$ in the per-frequency search. Our methods are already incorporated in community-available code and ready to deploy on forthcoming PTA datasets.

## 12. Suppression of the induced gravitational wave background due to third-order perturbations

**Abstract**: Suppression of the induced gravitational wave background due to third-order perturbations Raphael Picard, Luis E. Padilla, Karim A. Malik, David J. Mulryne Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this work, we revisit and evaluate new source terms which contribute to the induced gravitational wave background. We study their respective contributions to the stochastic gravitational wave background by computing their spectral densities in a radiation-dominated universe. These terms appear at third order in cosmological perturbation theory, however, their correlations with primordial gravitational waves are non-trivial and appear at the same order as so-called scalar induced and scalar-tensor induced gravitational waves. We find that these gravitational wave sources suppress the spectral density at the scales we consider. Furthermore, similarly to scalar-tensor source terms at second order, we find that some terms are enhanced when the input primordial power spectrum of scalar fluctuations is not sufficiently peaked. Hence, where possible, we show that under certain limits the integrands of these terms diverge in the UV sector.

**Abstract**: Two-Step Procedure to Detect Cosmological Gravitational Wave Backgrounds with Next-Generation Terrestrial Gravitational-Wave Detectors Haowen Zhong, Luca Reali, Bei Zhou, Emanuele Berti, Vuk Mandic Main text: 7 pages, 3 figures, 1 table. Supplemental material: 12 pages, 9 figures, 1 table Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 111401 (2025) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Cosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds are an exciting science target for next-generation ground-based detectors, as they encode invaluable information about the primordial Universe. However, any such background is expected to be obscured by the astrophysical foreground from compact-binary coalescences. We propose a novel framework to detect a cosmological gravitational-wave background in the presence of binary black holes and binary neutron star signals with next-generation ground-based detectors, including Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. Our procedure involves first removing all the individually resolved binary black hole signals by notching them out in the time-frequency domain. Then, we perform joint Bayesian inference on the individually resolved binary neutron star signals, the unresolved binary neutron star foreground, and the cosmological background. For a flat cosmological background, we find that we can claim detection at $5\,\sigma$ level when $\Omega_\mathrm{ref}\geqslant 2.7\times 10^{-12}/\sqrt{T_\mathrm{obs}/\mathrm{yr}}$, where $T_\mathrm{obs}$ is the observation time (in years), which is within a factor of $\lesssim2$ from the sensitivity reached in absence of these astrophysical foregrounds.

## 14. Structure and Skewness of the Effective Inspiral Spin Distribution of Binary Black Hole Mergers

**Abstract**: Structure and Skewness of the Effective Inspiral Spin Distribution of Binary Black Hole Mergers Sharan Banagiri, Thomas A. Callister, Christian Adamcewicz, Zoheyr Doctor, Vicky Kalogera High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The detection of gravitational waves has brought to light a population of binary black holes that merge within a Hubble time. Multiple formation channels can contribute to this population, making it difficult to definitively associate particular population features with underlying stellar physics. Black hole spins are considered an important discriminator between various channels, but they are less well-measured than masses, making conclusive astrophysical statements using spins difficult thus far. In this paper, we consider the distribution of the effective inspiral spin $\chi_{\rm eff}$ -- a quantity much better measured than individual component spins. We show that non-Gaussian features like skewness, asymmetry about zero, and multimodality can naturally arise in the $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution when multiple channels contribute to the population. Searching for such features, we find signs of skewness and asymmetry already in the current catalogs, but no statistically significant signs of bimodality. These features provide robust evidence for the presence of a subpopulation with spins preferentially aligned to the binary's orbital angular momentum; and we conservatively estimate the fraction of this subpopulation to be at least $12 \% - 17\%$ (at $90\%$ credibility). Our models do not find an excess of non-spinning systems and instead find that at least $\sim 20 \%$ of the binaries have some degree of negative $\chi_{\rm eff}$. The data also suggest that, if preferentially aligned mergers form a significant fraction of the population, they must have small spins.

## 15. Prospects and Limitations of PTAs Anisotropy Searches -- The Frequentist Case

**Abstract**: Prospects and Limitations of PTAs Anisotropy Searches -- The Frequentist Case Thomas Konstandin, Anna-Malin Lemke, Andrea Mitridate, Enrico Perboni Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Recent findings from several Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations point to the existence of a Gravitational Wave Background (GWB) at nanohertz frequencies. A key next step towards characterizing this signal and identifying its origin is to map the sky distribution of its power. Several strategies have been proposed to reconstruct this distribution using PTA data. In this work, we compare these different strategies to determine which one is best suited to detect GWB anisotropies of different topologies. We find that, for both localized and large-scale anisotropies, reconstruction methods based on pixel and radiometer maps are the most promising. However, in both scenarios, even the optimistically large anisotropic signals discussed in this work remain challenging to detect with near-future PTA sensitivities. For example, we find that for a GWB hotspot contributing to $80\%$ of the GWB power in the second frequency bin, detection probabilities reach at most $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ for a PTA with noise properties comparable with the ones of the upcoming IPTA third data release. Finally, we consider the fundamental limitations that cosmic variance poses to these kinds of searches by deriving the smallest deviations from isotropy that could be detected by an idealized PTA with no experimental or pulsar noise.

**Abstract**: Reviving WIMP dark matter with temperature-dependent couplings Debasish Borah, Arnab Dasgupta, Tong Arthur Wu 7+4 pages, 3+2 captioned figures High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The persistent null results at dark matter (DM) direct detection experiments have pushed the popular weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) DM to tight corners. Generic WIMP models with direct detection rate below the current upper limits often lead to thermally overproduced relic abundance after freeze-out. To resolve this conundrum, we propose a novel scenario where DM has temperature-dependent couplings with the standard model (SM) bath. A scalar field having a large vacuum expectation value (VEV) at high temperatures generates sizeable DM-SM interactions leading to efficient DM annihilations responsible for generating the desired thermal relic. At lower temperatures, the scalar field VEV settles down to a small value as a result of a first-order phase transition (FOPT), effectively leading to suppressed DM-SM interaction rate at low temperature, consistent with null results at direct detection experiments. Upper bound on thermal DM mass forces the FOPT to occur at scales such that the corresponding gravitational wave signal remains within reach of future experiments like LISA.

Specifically, we study a minimal, UV-complete $U(1)$ extension of the Standard Model with a Dirac DM candidate, whose annihilation into neutrinos proceeds exclusively through a $Z^\prime$ boson. By computing the annihilation cross section and comparing with the observed flux, we derive bounds on the model parameters. Additional constraints are obtained within the freeze-in framework, where the observed relic abundance is reproduced, leading to the strongest bounds. Considering cosmic string vibrations as a source of gravitational waves, we further constrain the vacuum expectation value of the $U(1)$ breaking. All results are contrasted with perturbativity limits and existing constraints from low- and high-energy experiments.

**Abstract**: Micro-Tidal Disruption Events in Young Star Clusters Sara Rastello, Giuliano Iorio, Mark Gieles, Long Wang 19 pages, 13 figures; submitted to A&A (under review); comments welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Dense young star clusters (YSCs) are ideal environments for dynamical interactions between stars and stellar mass black holes (BHs). In such dense environments, stars can undergo close encounters with BHs and fall within their tidal radius, resulting in micro-tidal disruption events (micro-TDEs), transient phenomena with potential multi-messenger signatures. We performed a suite of direct N-body simulations using the PETAR code, to which we implemented new prescriptions for modeling micro-TDEs. We constructed a set of realistic YSC models including primordial binaries, based on the observed Milky Way population. Our simulations incorporate stellar and binary evolution, supernova kicks, and stellar winds using the BSE code, and account for the Galactic tidal field via the GALPY library. We identify three dynamical channels for micro-TDE production: single star-single BH encounters, binary-mediated interactions (including supernova-kick triggers), and interactions involving higher-order multiple systems such as hierarchical triples and quadruples, as well as chaotic few-body interactions. Multiple encounters are the most efficient production channel, which dominates the total rate: 350-450 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. Micro-TDEs from YSCs are expected to be detectable by upcoming surveys, particularly the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, with detection rates potentially up to hundreds per year. The gravitational wave (GW) signals expected from micro-TDEs peak in the deci-Hertz band, making them accessible to future instruments such as the Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna and the Deci-Hertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. Micro-TDEs emerge as promising multi-messenger sources, potentially offering unique insights into star cluster dynamics, stellar collisions, and the population of dormant stellar-mass BHs, through both electromagnetic and GW observations.

## 19. When (not) to trust Monte Carlo approximations for hierarchical Bayesian inference

**Abstract**: When (not) to trust Monte Carlo approximations for hierarchical Bayesian inference Jack Heinzel, Salvatore Vitale High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The coming years of gravitational wave astrophysics promises thousands of new detections, which can unlock fundamental scientific insights if the information in each observation can be properly synthesized into a coherent picture. State-of-the-art approaches often accomplish this with hierarchical Bayesian inference. However, this typically relies on Monte Carlo approximations that are already very expensive in current data, and may become prohibitively so in the future. In this paper we show how this process can be understood from a first-principles statistical approach. We derive an error estimator $\hat{E}$ for quantifying the amount of information that is lost due to the Monte Carlo approximation and recommend that this error is limited to no more than $\hat{E} \lesssim 0.2$ bits for reliable inference. We also show that the hierarchical likelihood estimator is biased but may be corrected. Finally, we show some practical examples for inference on synthetic gravitational-wave population inference, demonstrating that simple models with strong assumptions can be much more stable to Monte Carlo uncertainty than those with weaker assumptions. We also provide a \texttt{pip}-installable package \texttt{population-error} with which analysts can calculate the error statistics $\hat{E}$.

## 20. Early warning for lensed gravitational wave counterparts from time delays of their host galaxies observed in the optical

**Abstract**: Early warning for lensed gravitational wave counterparts from time delays of their host galaxies observed in the optical Sourabh Magare, Anupreeta More, Shasvath J. Kapadia High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) can be leveraged to provide early-warning times of $\mathcal{O}({\rm hours})$ to $\mathcal{O}({\rm days})$ before the merger of Binary Neutron Stars (BNSs) and Neutron Star Black Holes (NSBHs). This in turn could enable electromagnetic (EM) telescopes to capture emissions surrounding the time of the merger. In this work, we assess the practicability of lensing-driven early-warning by analysing optical images of the lensed host galaxy to predict the arrival time of subsequent BNS/NSBH signals following the observation of the first signal. We produce mock lenses with image quality and resolution similar to images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the ground-based Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) on the Subaru telescope. We compare the time delay uncertainties between these two cases for typical lensed image configurations and multiplicity. These include doubles and quads, and among quads: the fold, cusp, cross image configurations. We find that time delay uncertainties for doubles are comparable for both HST and HSC mocks. On the other hand, quads tend to provide accurate time-delay predictions (typical relative error $\sim0.1$) with HST. Analysis of a real lens led to a difference in time-delay estimates of $\mathcal{O}(\rm days)$ between the predictions derived from HST and HSC data. Our work therefore strongly advocates the need for high-resolution EM observations of lensed host galaxies to feasibly enable lensing-driven early-warning.

## 21. Benchmarking the Plane-Wave Born and Distorted Waves approximations for electron-impact collision strengthcomputations: the sample case of Sr II

**Abstract**: Benchmarking the Plane-Wave Born and Distorted Waves approximations for electron-impact collision strengthcomputations: the sample case of Sr II J√©r√¥me Deprince, Lucas Maison Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Atomic Processes in Plasmas 2025 (Tokyo, Japan) Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph) The discovery of gravitational waves from a neutron star merger in 2017 (GW170817) and the associated kilonova (AT2017gfo) confirmed these events as key sites for heavy element production through the r-process. Subsequent observations, including late-time spectra with \textit{JWST}, have highlighted the need for accurate modeling of kilonova ejecta. In the photospheric phase, atomic level populations can be estimated under LTE using Boltzmann and Saha relations, but about a week after the merger the ejecta enters the nebular phase where non-LTE effects dominate. Modeling nebular spectra therefore requires a detailed treatment of radiative and collisional processes that affect the population of atomic levels. This work focuses on electron-impact excitation in Sr II, a heavy ion relevant for kilonova spectra. Two computational approaches are employed: the Plane Wave Born approximation within the pseudo-relativistic Hartree-Fock method, and a Distorted Waves method using AUTOSTRUCTURE. The resulting collision strengths are compared against reference R-matrix data to evaluate the accuracy of these approximations and their suitability for large-scale applications to all heavy elements. In addition, radiative parameters for forbidden transitions are computed. These results provide an essential benchmark of approximations that could be used to compute atomic data for nebular-phase kilonova modeling.

## 22. Mass Segregation and Transient Formation in Nuclear Stellar Clusters

**Abstract**: Mass Segregation and Transient Formation in Nuclear Stellar Clusters Barak Rom, Re'em Sari 15 pages, 2 figures. Submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies occasionally disrupt stars or consume stellar-mass black holes (BHs) that wander too close, producing observable electromagnetic or gravitational wave signals. We examine how mass segregation impacts the rates and distributions of such events. Assuming a relaxed stellar cluster, composed of stars and stellar-mass BHs, we show that the tidal disruption rate of massive stars ($m\gtrsim M_\odot$) is enhanced relative to their abundance in the stellar population. For stars up to $m\approx3M_\odot$, this enhancement is roughly $m/M_\odot$ and it is driven by segregation within the sphere of influence. Stars with masses $m\gtrsim3M_\odot$, if relaxed, are predominantly scattered by more massive stellar-mass BHs, leading to a constant enhancement factor of $\approx 9$, independent of mass. This aligns with observational evidence suggesting an over-representation of massive stars in tidal disruption events. For stellar-mass BHs, we predict an enhancement factor scaling as $m_\bullet^{1/2}$ for plunges and $m_\bullet^{3/2}$ for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). The power of one-half in both cases reflects the shorter relaxation times of heavier BHs, allowing them to segregate into the sphere of influence from greater distances, thereby increasing their abundance. The additional power in the EMRIs' rate arises from the tendency of heavier BHs to circularize and sink inward more efficiently. Finally, we estimate the rate of main-sequence star inspirals and find that it favors low-mass stars ($m\lesssim M_\odot$). This seems compatible with the observationally estimated rate of quasiperiodic eruptions.

PICZL code (Roster et al. 2024) used for computing the photo-z, is also released Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) To better understand the role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxy evolution, it is crucial to achieve a complete and pure AGN census. X-ray surveys are key to this, but identifying their counterparts (CTPs) at other wavelengths remains challenging due to their larger positional uncertainties and limited availability of deeper, uniform ancillary data. Euclid is revolutionising this effort, offering extensive coverage of nearly the entire extragalactic sky, particularly in the near-infrared bands, where AGN are more easily detected. With the first Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1), we identifyed, classifyed, and determined the redshifts of Euclid CTPs to known point-like sources from major X-ray surveys, including XMM-Newton, Chandra, and eROSITA. Using Bayesian statistics, combined with machine learning (ML), we identify the CTPs to 11 286 X-ray sources from the three X-ray telescopes. For the large majority of 10 194 sources, the associations are unique, with the remaining $\sim$ 10% of multi-CTP cases equally split between XMM-Newton and eROSITA. ML is then used to distinguish between Galactic (8%) and extragalactic (92%) sources. We computed photo-zs using deep learning for the 8617 sources detected in the 10th data release of the DESI Legacy Survey, reaching an accuracy and a fraction of outliers of about 5%. Based on their X-ray luminosities, over 99% of CTPs identified as extragalactic are classified as AGN, most of which appear unobscured given their hardness ratios. With this paper, we release our catalogue, which includes identifiers, basic X-ray properties, the details of the associations, and additional features such as Galactic/extragalactic classifications and photometric/spectroscopic redshifts. We also provide probabilities for sub-selecting the sample based on purity and completeness, allowing users to tailor the sample according to their specific needs.
