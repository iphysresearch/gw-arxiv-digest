**Abstract**: Detecting regular precession using a new gravitational waveform model directly parameterized by both precession amplitude and frequency Tamanjyot Singh, Evangelos Stoikos, Saif Ali, Nathan Steinle, Michael Kesden, Lindsay King 26 pages, 11 figures, submitted to PRD, codes are available at this https URL General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Nearly 210 binary black hole (BBH) mergers have been observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network during its four observing runs. Generic BBHs are spinning, and their spins are misaligned with the orbital angular momentum $\vec{L}$. These misaligned spins cause $\vec{L}$ to precess in a cone with dimensionless precession amplitude $\tilde{\theta}$ and frequency $\tilde{\Omega}$ about the nearly constant direction of the total angular momentum. This precession modulates the observed GWs. We propose a model of regularly precessing (RP) waveforms that incorporates $\tilde{\theta}$ and $\tilde{\Omega}$ directly as parameters. We investigate how these waveforms vary as functions of these precessional parameters, as well as binary orientation and sky location. We use the Lindblom criterion to estimate that precession can be detected in a RP source with signal-to-noise ratio $\rho$ when the mismatch $\epsilon$ with a non-precessing (NP) source with otherwise identical parameters exceeds $1/2\rho^2$. Precession is most detectable when $\vec{L}$ precesses through configurations we call +~nulls during the inspiral. At +~nulls, a NP source only emits +-polarization to which the GW detector is insensitive. The large mismatch between a RP source and this vanishing NP signal enhances the detectability of precession. We also explore the detectability of precession as a function of redshift $z$ for different BBH populations. We find that for BBHs with isotropically oriented maximal spins, precession is detectable in a majority of systems out to $z \approx 0.3$ for chirp masses $10 \lesssim M_c/M_\odot \lesssim 40$ and mass ratios $q \gtrsim 0.5$. Reduced spin magnitudes or greater alignment between the spins and $\vec{L}$ make it difficult to observe beyond $z \approx 0.1$. (abridged)

## 2. Spin-induced Quadrupole Moment (SIQM) Test for Eccentric Compact Binaries

**Abstract**: Spin-induced Quadrupole Moment (SIQM) Test for Eccentric Compact Binaries Syed U. Naqvi, Chandra Kant Mishra 2 pages, 1 figure, prepared for IOP Conference Series General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Spin-induced deformations of individual components of a binary can be quantified using the gravitational wave signal the binary emits. Such deformations are characterised by a parameter, $ \kappa $, which takes a value of 1 for a black hole and thus its measurement can be used to test the no-hair conjecture. However, in practice, only a symmetric combination of this parameter for a binary ($ \kappa_s $) can be measured, thus instead enabling a test for the no-hair conjecture in the context of a binary black hole system; see for instance, Krishnendu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 091101 (2017), arXiv:1701.06318. While previous studies have focused on circular binaries, we extend this test to eccentric systems in a Fisher matrix based analysis. We find that the error in the measurement of the parameter $ \kappa_s $ reduces from a value of about 18% (for the circular case) to close to 8% (4%) for a $ 10 M_{\odot} $ system with dimensionless component spins $ >0.8 $ and with a reference initial eccentricity ($ e_0 $) of 0.2 (0.4) evaluated at 5 Hz for a third generation detector, Cosmic Explorer (CE). Compared to the estimates obtained by using Advanced LIGO design sensitivity, eccentricity and the overall improved sensitivity of CE detectors together seem to improve these estimates almost by an order of magnitude.

**Abstract**: Transformer Networks for Continuous Gravitational-wave Searches Prasanna. M. Joshi, Reinhard Prix General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Wide-parameter-space searches for continuous gravitational waves (CWs) using semi-coherent matched-filter methods require enormous computing power, which limits their achievable sensitivity. Here we explore an alternative search method based on training neural networks as classifiers on detector strain data with minimal pre-processing. Contrary to previous studies using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we investigate the suitability of the transformer architecture, specifically the Vision Transformer (ViT). We establish sensitivity benchmarks using the matched-filter $\mathcal{F}$-statistic for ten targeted searches over a 10 day timespan, and ten directed and six all-sky searches over a 1 day timespan. We train ViTs on each of these benchmark cases. The trained ViTs achieve essentially matched-filter sensitivity on the targeted benchmarks, and approach the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic detection probability of $p_{\mathrm{det}}$ = 90% on the directed ($p_{\mathrm{det}} \approx $ 85-89 %) and all-sky benchmarks ($p_{\mathrm{det}} \approx $ 78-88 %). Unlike the CNNs in our previous studies, which required extensive manual design and hyperparameter tuning, the ViT achieves better performance with a standard architecture and minimal tuning.

**Abstract**: Can LIGO Detect Daylight Savings Time? Reed Essick General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Yes, it can. Catalogs produced by networks of Gravitational-wave interferometers are subject to complicated selection effects, and the gold-standard remains direct measurements of the detection probability through large injection campaigns. I leverage public data products from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations' 3rd and 4th observing runs to show that there are non-trivial temporal variations within the detection probability that are well-described by a weekly cycle. There are clear differences between weekends and weekdays, between day and night (at the sites), and even between daylight-savings and standard time. I discuss possible causes for this behavior and implications.

## 6. Universal relations for fast rotating neutron stars without equation of state bias

**Abstract**: Universal relations for fast rotating neutron stars without equation of state bias Christian J. Kr√ºger, Mariachiara Celato General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We provide a summary of several parametrisations for the nuclear equation of state that have been proposed over the past decades and list viable ranges for their parameters. Based on these parametrisations, we construct a large database of rotating neutron star models, which are arranged in sequences of constant central energy density. After filtering these sequences with respect to generous astrophysical constraints, we discover tight universal relations for various bulk quantities of uniformly rotating neutron stars of arbitrary rotation rates. These universal relations allow to estimate, at very low computational cost, bulk quantities of rotating neutron stars employing mass, radius, and moment of inertia of associated non-rotating neutron stars. The relations are calibrated to a large, model-agnostic dataset, thereby eliminating a potential bias, and prove to be robust. Such relations are important for future, high-precision measurements coming from electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations and may be used in equation of state inference codes or gravitational wave modeling among others.

## 7. Jiggled interferometer: Ground-based gravitational wave detector using rapidly-repeated free-falling test masses

**Abstract**: Jiggled interferometer: Ground-based gravitational wave detector using rapidly-repeated free-falling test masses Shoki Iwaguchi, Bin Wu, Kurumi Umemura, Tomohiro Ishikawa, Kenji Tsuji, Ryota Nishimura, Yuta Michimura, Yutaro Enomoto, Soichiro Morisaki, Yoichi Aso, Tomotada Akutsu, Keiko Kokeyama, Seiji Kawamura General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We propose the Jiggled Interferometer (JIGI), a novel ground-based gravitational wave detector with space-like sensitivity. Using rapidly-repeated free-fall test masses, JIGI eliminates seismic and suspension thermal noise during free fall. Compared to the Juggled Interferometer, it offers improved angular stability and avoids tracking lasers. We analyze detrending--a required step to remove actuation-induced noise--and show sensitivity gains of about four orders of magnitude in the 0.1-0.3 Hz band, relative to seismic and suspension noise extrapolated from the Cosmic Explorer.

**Abstract**: Higher-derivative Heterotic Kerr-Sen Black Holes Peng-Ju Hu, Liang Ma, Yi Pang, Robert J. Saskowski 47 pages, 1 figure; Mathematica file included High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph) We obtain the four-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution in heterotic supergravity, which includes the Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger solution as a limiting case. In particular, we first embed the Kerr solution into heterotic supergravity and compute the higher-derivative corrections. We then obtain the corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution by performing an $O(2,1)$ boost of the Kerr solution, which, in contrast to the two-derivative case, requires field redefinitions to make the $O(2,1)$ invariance of the action manifest. Finally, we compute the multipole moments and find that they are distinct from those of the Kerr solution at the four-derivative level. We also find that the multipole moments are distinct from those of the Kerr-Newman solution in Einstein-Maxwell theory at the four-derivative level, even for the most general choice of four-derivative corrections. This gives a way to experimentally distinguish traces of string theory in gravitational wave data.

**Abstract**: CWT-LSTM Autoencoder: A Novel Approach for Gravitational Wave Detection in Synthetic Data Jericho Cain Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Gravitational wave detection requires sophisticated signal processing to identify weak astrophysical signals buried in instrumental noise. Traditional matched filtering approaches face computational challenges with diverse signal morphologies and non-stationary noise. This work presents a deep learning approach combining Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) preprocessing with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder architecture for gravitational wave detection in synthetic data. The CWT provides optimal time-frequency decomposition capturing chirp evolution and transient characteristics essential for compact binary coalescence identification. The LSTM autoencoder learns compressed representations while maintaining sensitivity to subtle signal features distinguishing true astrophysical events from noise artifacts. We generate realistic synthetic datasets incorporating binary black hole merger signals with masses ranging from 10 to 80 solar masses, embedded in colored Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity. The trained model demonstrates strong performance metrics: 92.3 percent precision, 67.6 percent recall, and 80.6 percent AUC-ROC, with an average precision score of 0.780. These results exceed LIGO's stringent detection thresholds for confident gravitational wave identification. Compared to traditional approaches, the CWT-LSTM autoencoder shows superior ability to maintain low false alarm rates while preserving sensitivity to weak signals. The method's end-to-end learning eliminates hand-crafted features and template banks, offering a promising pathway toward more robust gravitational wave detection systems. The unsupervised nature enables discovery of signals with unknown morphologies, providing complementary "blind search" capability for detecting exotic astrophysical sources and novel physics beyond current theoretical models.

## 10. Bias in the tensor-to-scalar ratio from self-interacting dark radiation

**Abstract**: Bias in the tensor-to-scalar ratio from self-interacting dark radiation Nahuel Mir√≥n-Granese, Claudia G. Sc√≥ccola Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We investigate the cosmological imprint of self-interacting dark radiation (DR) on the primordial $B$-mode angular power spectrum and its impact on the estimation of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We consider a minimal model in which DR is described as an effectively massless axion-like particle with quartic self-interactions. These interactions are incorporated into the Einstein-Boltzmann equations using the relaxation time approximation and implemented in the $\texttt{CLASS}$ code. We show that increasing the strength of DR self-interactions suppresses anisotropic stress, thereby reducing the damping of gravitational waves and leading to an enhancement of the primordial $B$-mode signal relative to the free-streaming case. Using mock CMB data and Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses, we show that neglecting DR self-interactions may bias the inferred value of $r$ by an amount comparable to the uncertainty expected in forthcoming CMB polarization experiments, such as the ground-based $\textit{Simons Observatory}$ and the satellite missions $\textit{LiteBIRD}$ and PICO. Our results emphasize the importance of properly modeling DR interactions in future precision searches for primordial $B$-modes in order to obtain unbiased constraints on inflationary gravitational waves.

Submitted to CERN LHCC as Letter of Intent High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph) We propose an O(100)m Atom Interferometer (AI) experiment to be installed against a wall of the PX46 access shaft to the LHC. This experiment would probe unexplored ranges of the possible couplings of bosonic ultralight dark matter (ULDM) to atomic constituents and undertake a pioneering search for gravitational waves (GWs) at frequencies intermediate between those to which existing and planned experiments are sensitive, among other fundamental physics studies. A conceptual feasibility study showed that this AI experiment could be isolated from the LHC by installing a shielding wall in the TX46 gallery, and surveyed issues related to the proximity of the LHC machine, finding no technical obstacles. A detailed technical implementation study has shown that the preparatory civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and installation of an elevator platform could be carried out during LS3, allowing installation and operation of the detector to proceed during Run 4 without impacting HL-LHC operation. These studies have established that PX46 is a uniquely promising location for an AI experiment. We foresee that, if the CERN management encourages this Letter of Intent, a significant fraction of the Terrestrial Very Long Baseline Atom Interferometer (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration may wish to contribute to such an AI experiment.

**Abstract**: Astrophysics: a Modern Discipline with a Newtonian origin M. Paola Vaccaro 14 pages. This article is part of the theme issue "Newton, Principia, Newton Geneva Edition (17th-19th) and modern Newtonian mechanics: heritage, past, and present" High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph) Understanding the formation and evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) requires a thorough investigation of the key physical processes involved. While one pathway involves the isolated evolution of massive binary stars, affected by uncertain stages like core-collapse supernovae and common envelope evolution, an alternative channel is dynamical formation in dense stellar environments. Newtonian gravity has traditionally provided a robust and computationally efficient framework for modeling large-scale gravitational interactions. However, accurately capturing close encounters and black hole mergers necessitates the use of general relativity. This work focuses on assessing the applicability of post-Newtonian gravity in bridging these regimes, offering a physically insightful and computationally tractable approach to modeling BBH formation in the gravitational-wave era of astronomy.

## 14. Gravitational Waveform and Polarization from Binary Black Hole Inspiral in Dynamical Chern-Simons Gravity: From Generation to Propagation

The equation of motion (EOM) of the spinining binary BHs is derived based on the modified Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equation for the spin-aligned circular orbits. The leading-order effects induced by the dCS theory contains spin-spin interaction and monopole-quadrupole interaction, which influence both the EOM of the binary system and corresponding gravitational waveform at the second post-Newtonian (PN) order (i.e., 2PN order). After reporting the waveforms, we investigate the polarization modes of gravitational waves (GWs) in dCS theory. None of the extra modes appears in this theory up to the considered PN order. Moreover, since the time scale of the binary merger is much smaller than that of the cosmological expansion, the parity-violating effect of the dCS theory does not appear in the process of GW generation. However, during the process of GW propagation, amplitude birefringence, a typical parity-violating effect, makes plus and cross modes convert to each other, which modifies the gravitational waveform at 1.5PN order.

**Abstract**: Which is which? Identification of the two compact objects in gravitational-wave binaries Davide Gerosa, Viola De Renzis, Federica Tettoni, Matthew Mould, Alberto Vecchio, Costantino Pacilio 5 pages, 3 figures + appendices Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 121402 (2025) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Compact objects observed in gravitational-wave astronomy so far always come in pairs and never individually. Identifying the two components of a binary system is a delicate operation that is often taken for granted. The labeling procedure (i.e., which is object "1" and which is object "2") effectively acts as systematics, or, equivalently an unspecified prior, in gravitational-wave data inference. The common approach is to label the objects solely by their masses, on a sample-by-sample basis. We show that object identification can instead be tackled using the posterior distribution as a whole. We frame the problem in terms of constrained clustering -- a flavor of semi-supervised machine learning -- and find that unfolding the labeling systematics can significantly impact, and arguably improve, our interpretation of the data. In particular, the precision of black-hole spin measurements improves by up to 50%, multimodalities and tails tend to disappear, posteriors become closer to Gaussian distributions, and the identification of the nature of the object (i.e. black hole vs. neutron star) is facilitated. We estimate that about 10% of the LIGO/Virgo posterior samples are affected by this relabeling, i.e. they might have been attributed to the other compact object in the observed binaries.

## 16. External Attention Transformer: A Robust AI Model for Identifying Initial Eccentricity Signatures in Binary Black Hole Events in Simulated Advanced LIGO Data

**Abstract**: External Attention Transformer: A Robust AI Model for Identifying Initial Eccentricity Signatures in Binary Black Hole Events in Simulated Advanced LIGO Data Elahe Khalouei, Cristiano G. Sabiu, Hyung Mok Lee, A. Gopakumar Accepted for publication in JCAP General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Initial orbital eccentricities of gravitational wave (GW) events associated with merging binary black holes (BBHs) should provide clues to their formation scenarios, mainly because various BBH formation channels predict distinct eccentricity distributions. However, searching for inspiral GWs from eccentric BBHs is computationally challenging due to sophisticated approaches to model such GW events. This ensures that Bayesian parameter estimation methods to characterize such events are computationally daunting. These considerations influenced us to propose a novel approach to identify and characterize eccentric BBH events in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration data sets that leverages external attention transformer models. Employing simulated data that mimic LIGO O4 run, eccentric inspiral events modeled by an effective-one-body numerical-relativity waveform family, we show the effectiveness of our approach. By integrating this transformer-based framework with a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, we provide efficient way to identify eccentric BBH GW events and accurately characterize their source properties.

## 17. Shadow constraints of charged black hole with scalar hair and gravitational waves from extreme mass ratio inspirals

**Abstract**: Shadow constraints of charged black hole with scalar hair and gravitational waves from extreme mass ratio inspirals Lai Zhao, Meirong Tang, Zhaoyi Xu General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Black hole (BH) shadow observations and gravitational wave astronomy have become crucial approaches for exploring BH physics and testing gravitational theories in extreme environments. This paper investigates the charged black hole with scalar hair (CBH-SH) derived from the Einstein-Maxwell-conformal coupled scalar (EMCS) theory. We first constrain the parameter space $(Q/M, s/M^2)$ of the BH using the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87* and Sgr A*. The results show that M87* provides stronger constraints on positive scalar hair, constraining the scalar hair $s$ within $0\le s/M^2\le0.4632$ and the charge $Q$ within the range $0\le Q/M\le0.6806$. In contrast, Sgr A* imposes tighter constraints on negative scalar hair. When $Q$ approaches zero, $s$ is constrained within the range $0\geq s/M^2\geq-0.0277$. Overall, EHT observations can provide constraints at most on the order of $\mathcal{O}\left({10}^{-1}\right)$. Subsequently, we construct extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) systems and calculate their gravitational waves to assess the detection capability of the LISA detector for these BHs. The results indicate that for central BHs of $M={10}^6M_\odot$, LISA is expected to detect scalar hair $s/M^2$ at the $\mathcal{O}\left({10}^{-4}\right)$ level and charge $Q/M$ at the $\mathcal{O}\left({10}^{-2}\right)$ level, with detection sensitivity far exceeding the current EHT capabilities. This demonstrates the immense potential of EMRI gravitational wave observations in testing EMCS theory.

**Abstract**: Probing Dark Matter's Gravitational Effects Locally with TianQin Zheng-Cheng Liang, Fa-Peng Huang, Xuefeng Zhang, Yi-Ming Hu General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this study, we explore the potential of using TianQin missions to probe the local gravitational effects of dark matter. The TianQin project plans to launch satellites at both low and high orbits. High-precision orbit determination is expected to aid in detecting Earth's gravity or gravitational waves. By comparing the derived masses in low and high orbits, it is possible to constrain the amount of dark matter between the two spheres, hence placing a local constraint on dark matter's gravitational effect. Our results show the capability of TianQin in detecting the density of dark matter around Earth, with an ultimate sensitivity to a value of $10^{-8}\,\,{\rm kg\,\,m^{-3}}$. This detection limit surpasses the estimated bounds for the solar system and the observation results for our Galaxy by approximately 7 and 14 orders of magnitude, respectively.

Baral, M. Baratti, J. C. Barayoga, B. C. Barish General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We present the first directed searches for long-transient and continuous gravitational waves from ultralight vector boson clouds around known black holes (BHs). We use LIGO data from the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run. The searches target two distinct types of BHs and use two new semicoherent methods: hidden Markov model (HMM) tracking for the remnant BHs of the mergers GW230814_230901 and GW231123_135430 (referred to as GW230814 and GW231123 in this study), and a dedicated method using the Band Sampled Data (BSD) framework for the galactic BH in the Cygnus X-1 binary system. Without finding evidence of a signal from vector bosons in the data, we estimate the mass range that can be constrained. For the HMM searches targeting the remnants from GW231123 and GW230814, we disfavor vector boson masses in the ranges $[0.94, 1.08]$ and $[2.75, 3.28] \times 10^{-13}$ eV, respectively, at 30% confidence, assuming a 1% false alarm probability. Although these searches are only marginally sensitive to signals from merger remnants at relatively large distances, future observations are expected to yield more stringent constraints with high confidence. For the BSD search targeting the BH in Cygnus X-1, we exclude vector boson masses in the range $[0.85, 1.59] \times 10^{-13}$ eV at 95% confidence, assuming an initial BH spin larger than 0.5.

**Abstract**: Neutron-quark stars: Discerning viable alternatives for the higher-density part of the equation of state of compact stars Sudipta Hensh, Yong-Jia Huang, Toru Kojo, Luca Baiotti, Kentaro Takami, Shigehiro Nagataki, Hajime Sotani 8+8 pages, 4+4 figures, ApJL published High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th) We investigate binary neutron star (BNS) mergers using general-relativistic numerical simulations with hadronic and hybrid equations of state (EOSs), incorporating the latest observations and theoretical constraints. We address two viable scenarios for the transition to quark matter: a quark-hadron crossover (QHC) or a strong first-order phase transition (1PT). To distinguish between different models, we define neutron-quark stars (NQS) as configurations where quark effects emerge at masses below the lowest observed neutron-star mass. While traditional "hybrid stars" may be distinguished by purely hadronic configurations through mass-radius measurements, the mass-radius relations of NQSs resemble those of purely hadronic models, with no sharp boundary between hadrons and quarks. The name NQS effectively captures the absence of a phase boundary between hadrons and quarks in QHC scenarios. Our results indicate that QHC models can be distinguished from hadronic ones if both the inspiral and postmerger gravitational waves (GWs) are observed. In particular, the dominant postmerger frequency ($f_2$) tends to be lower than in hadronic models with the same tidal deformability ($\Lambda$). We also present the first general-relativistic simulations of BNS mergers where the stars already contain quark matter before merging. These involve a strong first-order phase transition (1PT) at 1.8 times nuclear saturation density, followed by a stiff quark EOS. Finally, we identify a robust linear correlation between the total GW energy emitted after the merger and the $f_2$ frequency. Remarkably, this relation holds regardless of the quark presence.

## 21. Solar System Experiments in the Search for Dark Energy and Dark Matter

**Abstract**: Solar System Experiments in the Search for Dark Energy and Dark Matter Slava G. Turyshev Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We reassess the realistic discovery reach of Solar System experiments for dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) and quantify their complementarity to dedicated cosmological probes, such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and Euclid mission. In scalar-tensor frameworks with universal conformal coupling A(\phi), screening (chameleon/symmetron, Vainshtein) suppresses fifth forces in deep Solar potentials, consistent with the gravitational-wave speed bound |c_T/c - 1| < 10^{-15}. We treat Solar-System tests as hypothesis-driven probes: we assemble quantitative guardrails (MICROSCOPE \eta, Cassini \gamma, LLR \dot G/G and SEP, ephemeris limits on \rho_DM and Yukawa \alpha(\lambda), and clock-network searches for ultralight DM), place them alongside current cosmology posteriors, and provide an explicit map from cosmology-level linear response (e.g., \mu_{lin,0}) to local residuals using the screening relations (thin-shell and Vainshtein). Guided by systematics-gated criteria, we outline a near-term program--solar-conjunction Shapiro-delay and Doppler/range tests, sustained millimeter-class LLR, global optical-clock links, refined ephemerides, and spaceborne atom interferometry (AIS)--with realistic sensitivities |\gamma-1|< (2-5) x 10^{-6} per conjunction, \eta_EEP ~ 10^{-16}-10^{-17} (AIS), |\dot{G}/G| < (1-3) x 10^{-14} yr^{-1} (near-term; with LLR next-gen stations and CCRs, few x 10^{-15}), a uniform ~2x tightening of AU-scale Yukawa/DM-density bounds, and (3-10)x gains in ultralight-DM couplings from clock networks. Primary discovery potential for late-time dark energy lies with multi-probe cosmology (geometry and growth), while a hypothesis-driven Solar System program supplies high-leverage falsification and selective discovery windows for dark matter with ultralight mediators or long-range forces.

Forming ~10^9 Msun SMBHs by z ~ 6 is challenging and may require hierarchical mergers of smaller seed black holes. We extend a semi-analytic seed model (Sassano et al. 2021) by explicitly incorporating GW recoil physics. Our model includes: (1) recoil velocity formulae calibrated to numerical relativity for spinning, unequal-mass BH binaries (Campanelli et al. 2007; Lousto et al. 2012); (2) assignment of spin magnitudes and orientations based on seed type (Pop III remnant, stellar cluster, or direct-collapse); and (3) a retention probability scheme comparing the recoil speed to the host halo escape velocity. We find that including GW recoil reduces final SMBH masses by ~20-30% by z = 6 and creates a population of off-nuclear ("wandering") BHs amounting to a few percent of the total. Observable consequences include spatial offsets ~0.1 arcsec and line-of-sight velocity shifts ~10^2-10^3 km/s in a few percent of high-z quasars. All code is publicly available at this https URL

## 23. Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and The Signatures of Cosmic Non-Gaussianity

**Abstract**: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and The Signatures of Cosmic Non-Gaussianity Owais Farooq, Romana Zahoor, Balungi Francis Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a unique probe of the small-scale primordial Uni- verse and may constitute a fraction of the dark matter. Their formation is highly sensitive to non-Gaussian features in the primordial curvature perturbation {\zeta}. In this work we inves- tigate PBH production in the curvaton scenario, where the decay of a late-time light scalar field imprints large, inherently non-Gaussian fluctuations on small scales. Using the exact non-linear mapping between the Gaussian curvaton field perturbations and {\zeta}, we compute the full non-perturbative probability distribution functions of {\zeta} and derive the PBH for- mation fraction \b{eta} without relying on a truncated non-Gaussian expansion. We show that the enhanced tail of the distribution dramatically amplifies PBH production, leading to an exponential sensitivity of \b{eta} to the curvaton decay fraction {\Omega}\c{hi},dec. By modeling the scale dependence of curvaton fluctuations with a lognormal profile, we obtain realistic, extended PBH mass spectra rather than monochromatic peaks. We further highlight the associated stochastic gravitational-wave background induced at second order, whose peak frequency correlates directly with the PBH mass scale. Our results demonstrate that the curvaton scenario naturally produces a rich phenomenology of PBHs and gravitational waves, sharply distinct from Gaussian single-field inflation models, and provide a framework for connecting small-scale non-Gaussian physics to upcoming gravitational-wave and PBH observations.

## 24. Gravitational Waves from $\textit{Type-I}$ Strings in a Neutrino Mass Model

**Abstract**: Gravitational Waves from $\textit{Type-I}$ Strings in a Neutrino Mass Model Adeela Afzal High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) In this work, we propose a novel realization of $\textit{type-I}$ cosmic strings arising from the spontaneous breaking of an extended gauge symmetry $SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}$ in the context of a low-scale split seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass generation. We demonstrate that the split seesaw framework, which explains the smallness of neutrino masses, naturally motivates a small scalar self-coupling $\lambda$. This intrinsically links the neutrino mass generation mechanism to the formation of $\textit{type-I}$ cosmic strings, where the gauge coupling dominates over the scalar self-coupling ($\beta\equiv\lambda/2g^2<1$). We explore the cosmological implications of these strings, including their gravitational wave signatures that are testable in current and future experiments. Our findings establish a compelling and testable connection between neutrino mass generation and cosmic string phenomenology in an underexplored region of parameter space.

**Abstract**: Systematic bias in dark siren statistical methods and its impact on Hubble constant measurement V. Alfradique, C. R. Bom, T. Castro v2: minor corrections; matches version to appear in PRD Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The advent of multimessenger cosmology, marked by the detection of GW170817, demonstrated that standard sirens are a valuable cosmological probe. In the absence of an electromagnetic counterpart identification, gravitational waves carry valuable information through the dark siren approach, where the source redshift is estimated using galaxy catalogs of potential hosts within the localisation volume. However, the DS analysis can be affected by galaxy catalog incompleteness at the limits of gravitational-wave detectability, potentially introducing biases in the constraints on cosmological parameters. Focusing on GWs from binary black holes detected by the LVK collaboration, we explore the possible systematic biases in the measurement of the $H_0$. These biases may arise from (1) the incompleteness of catalogs due to the apparent magnitude thresholds of optical telescope sensitivity, and (2) the use of incorrect weighting schemes for each potential host. We found that an unbiased estimate of $H_0$ can be obtained when the corrected weighting scheme is applied to a complete or volume-limited catalog. We use a complete galaxy catalog covering 90% of the localisation probability for each GW detection, employing stellar mass as a tracer. Our results show that a sample of 100 binary black hole events with $A_{90\%}$<10 deg$^2$ and measured luminosity distances below 1600(2500) Mpc, detected by the LVK at O4(O5) sensitivity, can provide a percent-level measurement of $H_0$, with a precision of 3%(1%). This number of detections is expected to be accumulated after approximately 8 and 3 years of observations with the LVK at O4 and O5 sensitivity, respectively. The O5 run provides a reduction in the $H_0$ uncertainty by 1.34 km/s/Mpc compared to the O4-like configuration. The $H_0$ precision increases to approximately 6% when it is assumed that every galaxy has an equal probability of being the host.

**Abstract**: Sub-GeV dark matter and nano-Hertz gravitational waves from a classically conformal dark sector Sowmiya Balan, Torsten Bringmann, Felix Kahlhoefer, Jonas Matuszak, Carlo Tasillo 33 pages, 12 figures + appendices; v2: figure names corrected; v3: version matched to journal (JCAP), using updated version of GW spectal shape High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Strong first-order phase transitions in a dark sector offer a compelling explanation for the stochastic gravitational wave background in the nano-Hertz range recently detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). We explore the possibility that such a phase transition at the same time gives mass to a stable fermion that accounts for the observed dark matter abundance and leads to testable effects in laboratory experiments. Concretely, we consider a classically conformal dark sector with a hidden $U(1)^\prime$ gauge symmetry that couples to the Standard Model via kinetic mixing. Since the PTA signal requires a phase transition in the MeV temperature range, spontaneous symmetry breaking gives rise to a sub-GeV dark matter candidate that couples to the Standard Model via a dark photon mediator and obtains its relic abundance via annihilations into electrons and dark Higgs bosons. Such a scenario is tightly constrained by laboratory searches for dark photons and cosmological constraints on the decays of dark Higgs bosons after the phase transition. We show that viable parameter regions can be found both for the case that the dark Higgs bosons remain in equilibrium with the Standard Model and that they decouple and only decay much later. In the latter case, the parameter regions preferred by the PTA signal and the dark matter relic abundance can be fully explored by future beam-dump experiments searching for missing energy.

**Abstract**: Primordial black holes and magnetic fields in conformal neutrino mass models Shyam Balaji, Jo√£o Gon√ßalves, Danny Marfatia, Ant√≥nio P. Morais, Roman Pasechnik 24 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables. Version to appear in JCAP High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex) Sufficiently strong and long-lasting first-order phase transitions can produce primordial black holes (PBHs) that contribute substantially to the dark matter abundance of the Universe, and can produce large-scale primordial magnetic fields. We study these mechanisms in a generic class of conformal $\mathrm{U(1)}^\prime$ models that also explain active neutrino oscillation data via the type-I seesaw mechanism. We find that phase transitions that occur at seesaw scales between $10^4$ GeV and $10^{11}$ GeV produce gravitational wave signals (from the dynamics of the phase transition and from the decay of cosmic string loops) at LISA/ET that can be correlated with microlensing signals of PBHs at the Roman Space Telescope, while scales near $10^{11}$ GeV can be correlated with Hawking evaporation signals at future gamma-ray telescopes. LISA can probe the entire range of PBH masses between $1\times 10^{-16}M_\odot$ and $8\times 10^{-11}M_\odot$ if PBHs fully account for the dark matter abundance. For Z' masses between 40 TeV and $10^4$ TeV, and 10 TeV right-handed neutrinos, helical magnetic fields can be produced with magnitudes $\gtrsim 0.5$ pG and coherence lengths $\gtrsim 0.008$ Mpc, above current blazar lower bounds.

**Abstract**: Theoretical Signatures of QCD Phase Transitions in Compact Astrophysical Systems Debarshi Mukherjee Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat) We investigate theoretical signatures of first-order QCD phase transitions in high-density astrophysical systems through a framework combining lattice QCD, effective field theories, and multimessenger constraints. Hybrid equations of state with Maxwell and Gibbs constructions, constrained by lattice QCD at finite temperature and baryon chemical potential up to mu_B/T < 3, interpolate consistently between chiral effective field theory at nuclear densities and perturbative QCD at asymptotic densities. Applying these models to static neutron stars via Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations and to binary mergers via relativistic hydrodynamics, we find distinctive signatures: (i) twin star branches with 0.5-2.0 km radius differences at fixed mass, (ii) equation of state softening in coexistence regions reducing maximum masses by 0.2-0.4 solar masses, (iii) delayed post-merger gravitational-wave frequency shifts of 200-400 Hz, and (iv) enhanced neutrino emission during phase transitions. Confronted with multimessenger constraints from GW170817, NICER observations of PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451, and perturbative QCD, our models suggest strong first-order transitions are marginally consistent with current data but produce signatures detectable by next-generation detectors. Neutron star core sound speeds satisfy c_s^2 < 0.5c^2, with transient conformal bound violations in 2-4 times saturation density. This framework yields quantitative predictions for the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, establishing foundations for precision QCD matter tests and possible quark matter discovery.

We further confront these astrophysical limits with complementary bounds from the Planck-observed relic abundance via the freeze-in mechanism, big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), gravitational wave signatures from cosmic strings, and searches at energy and intensity frontier experiments.

**Abstract**: Gravitational wave energy spectral density properties from BPASS Galactic binary population in the Milky Way galaxy Petra Tang, Renate Meyer, Jan Eldridge Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We analyse the energy spectral density properties of Gravitational waves from Galactic binary populations in the~\text{mHz} band targeted by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna mission. Our analysis is based on combining BPASS with a Milky Way analogue galaxy from the Feedback In Realistic Environment (FIRE) simulations and the GWs these populations emit. Our investigation compares different functional forms of gravitational wave (GW) ESDs, namely the single power-law, broken power-law, and single-peak models, revealing disparities within and among Galactic binary populations. We estimate the ESDs for six different Galactic binary populations and the ESD of the total Galactic binary population for LISA. Employing a single power-law model, we predict a total Galactic binary GW signal amplitude $\alpha$ = $2.0^{+0.2}_{-0.2} \times 10^{-8}$ and a slope $\beta$ = $-2.64 ^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ and the ESD $\rm h^2 \Omega_{GW}$ = $1.1 ^{+0.1}_{-0.1} \times 10^{-9}$ at 3~\text{mHz}. For the Galactic WDB binary GW signal $\alpha = 1^{+0.02}_{-0.02} \times 10^{-10}$, $\beta = -1.56 ^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$ and $\rm h^2 \Omega_{GW} = 18 ^{+1}_{-1} \times 10^{-12}$. Our analysis underscores the importance of accurate noise parameter estimation and highlights the complexities of modelling realistic observations, prompting future exploration into more flexible models.

However, their origin remains poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of a septuple protostellar system embedded in a Keplerian disk within the high-mass star-forming region NGC\,6334IN, with close separations of 181-461 AU. The stability analysis reveals that the disk surrounding the septuple system is dynamically unstable, indicating that the septuple system formed via disk fragmentation. Previous studies have typically found only 2--3 members forming via disk fragmentation in both low- and high-mass star-forming regions. Our findings provide compelling observational evidence that the fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable disk is a viable mechanism for the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity, confirming what was previously only a theoretical concept. The results shed new light on the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity in cluster environments.
