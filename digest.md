**Abstract**: A Python Interface for Numerical Relativity Program AMSS-NCKU Chen-Kai Qiao, Yi Zheng, Zhou-Jian Cao 11 pages, 3 figures, 1 appendix General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Numerical relativity has produced wide-ranging influences on modern astrophysics and gravitational-wave astronomy. In this work, we develop a Python interface for the numerical relativity program AMSS-NCKU, which enables the automation of initializing and starting the AMSS-NCKU simulations and the automatically generating visualizations of the output results. Numerical relativity simulations using this Python interface have been presented through two representative examples (binary back hole and triple black hole merger processes), and well-behaved stable numerical results and the expected physical behaviors for black hole systems have been acquired. The Python operational interface significantly lowers the operational complexity of the simulation workflow of AMSS-NCKU simulations, reducing the technical barriers for freshman users.

**Abstract**: (Gravitational Wave) Memory of Starobinsky in a Time Crystal (Condensate) Aurindam Mondal, Subir Ghosh GW Memory Effect, Geodesic Equations General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this Letter we have revealed the presence of Gravitational Wave Memory Effect (GWME) in a new and physically appealing scenario - the Time Crystal (TC) condensate of Starobinsky Quadratic Gravity. We have used a Gravitational Wave form, induced in a TC condensate in FLRW spacetime, that is much more general than the idealized and somewhat unphysical Plane Wave spacetimes, that are conventionally used. We have presented new results for non-zero GWME, both in coordinate and in velocity variables. The results are expressed in Cartesian and Brinkmann coordinates. Approximate analytic forms of transverse geodesics in Brinkmann coordinates are provided. Very rough quantitative estimates for GWME are also suggested.

In particular, we derive the equations for $l=2$, $M_z=2$ perturbations of these objects which are parametrized by an asymmetry parameter. The equations constitute an astrophysically interesting sector of the perturbations that contribute dominantly to the gravitational wave radiation. Moreover, calculation of these modes may exhibit potential instabilities in the quadrupole sector.

**Abstract**: Likelihood-free inference for gravitational-wave data analysis and public alerts Ethan Marx, Deep Chatterjee, Malina Desai, Ravi Kumar, William Benoit, Argyro Sasli, Leo Singer, Michael W. Coughlin, Philip Harris, Erik Katsavounidis General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Rapid and reliable detection and dissemination of source parameter estimation data products from gravitational-wave events, especially sky localization, is critical for maximizing the potential of multi-messenger astronomy. Machine learning based detection and parameter estimation algorithms are emerging as production ready alternatives to traditional approaches. Here, we report validation studies of AMPLFI, a likelihood-free inference solution to low-latency parameter estimation of binary black holes. We use simulated signals added into data from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's (LVK's) third observing run (O3) to compare sky localization performance with BAYESTAR, the algorithm currently in production for rapid sky localization of candidates from matched-filter pipelines. We demonstrate sky localization performance, measured by searched area and volume, to be equivalent with BAYESTAR. We show accurate reconstruction of source parameters with uncertainties for use distributing low-latency coarse-grained chirp mass information. In addition, we analyze several candidate events reported by the LVK in the third gravitational-wave transient catalog (GWTC-3) and show consistency with the LVK's analysis. Altogether, we demonstrate AMPLFI's ability to produce data products for low-latency public alerts.

**Abstract**: Forecasting Seismic Waveforms: A Deep Learning Approach for Einstein Telescope Waleed Esmail, Alexander Kappes, Stuart Russell, Christine Thomas 8 pages, 3 figures, ICRC 2025 Proceedings Machine Learning (cs.LG); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We introduce \textit{SeismoGPT}, a transformer-based model for forecasting three-component seismic waveforms in the context of future gravitational wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope. The model is trained in an autoregressive setting and can operate on both single-station and array-based inputs. By learning temporal and spatial dependencies directly from waveform data, SeismoGPT captures realistic ground motion patterns and provides accurate short-term forecasts. Our results show that the model performs well within the immediate prediction window and gradually degrades further ahead, as expected in autoregressive systems. This approach lays the groundwork for data-driven seismic forecasting that could support Newtonian noise mitigation and real-time observatory control.

**Abstract**: Probing high-frequency gravitational waves with entangled vibrational qubits in linear Paul traps Ryoto Takai High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph) This work investigates the use of linear Paul traps as quantum sensors for detecting megahertz gravitational waves. Single-ion configurations exploit graviton-photon conversion in the presence of external magnetic fields, while two-ion systems use relative-motion excitations, which do not require magnets, to distinguish gravitational waves from axion dark matter. Furthermore, we show that entanglement of $N$ vibrational qubits enhances the signal probability by a factor of $N^2$, improving sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit.

## 7. Swift Memory Burden in Merging Black Holes: how information load affects black hole's classical dynamics

**Abstract**: Swift Memory Burden in Merging Black Holes: how information load affects black hole's classical dynamics Gia Dvali High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) In this paper we argue that the information load carried by a black hole affects its classical perturbations. We refer to this phenomenon as the ``swift memory burden effect" and show that it is universal for objects of high efficiency of information storage. The effect is expected to have observable manifestations, for example, in mergers of astrophysical black holes in Einstein gravity. The black holes with different information loads, although degenerate in the ground state, respond very differently to perturbations. The strength of the imprint is controlled by the memory burden parameter which measures the fraction of the black hole's memory space occupied by the information load. This represents a new macroscopic quantum characteristics of a black hole. We develop a calculable theoretical framework and derive some master formulas which we then test on explicit models of black holes as well as on solitons of high capacity of information storage. We show that the effect must be significant for the spectroscopy of both astrophysical and primordial black holes and can be potentially probed in gravitational wave experiments. We also provide a proposal for the test of the memory burden phenomenon in a table-top laboratory setting with cold bosons.

**Abstract**: Correspondence between 3BF and Einstein-Cartan formulations of quantum gravity Pavle Stipsic, Marko Vojinovic v2: published version, 22+6 pages, no figures Class. Quant. Grav. 42, 195009 (2025) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We construct a correspondence between the quantized constrained 3BF theory and the quantized Einstein-Cartan theory with contact spin-spin interaction, both of which describe the Standard Model coupled to Einstein-Cartan gravitational field. First we introduce the expectation values of observables using the path integral formalism for both theories, and then by integrating out some configuration space variables in the quantum 3BF theory we obtain the definition of the corresponding observable in the quantum Einstein-Cartan theory with contact interaction. The correspondence is a rather general result, since it can be established without actually performing the detailed quantization of either theory. Finally, we discuss the differences in the predictions of the two theories on the example of the 4-volume density of spacetime, and on the example of gravitational waves.

## 9. Attention U-Net for all-sky continuous gravitational wave searches

**Abstract**: Attention U-Net for all-sky continuous gravitational wave searches Damon H. T. Cheung General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det) Detecting continuous gravitational waves is challenging due to the high computational cost of template-based searches across large parameter spaces, particularly for all-sky searches. Machine learning offers a promising solution to perform these searches with reasonable computational resources. In this study, we trained an attention U-Net, a convolutional neural network, on $\approx$ 10.67 days of simulated data with Gaussian noise for all-sky searches at different frequencies within the 20-1000 Hz band. Our model trained at 20 Hz achieves the best sensitivity, with a 90% detection efficiency sensitivity depth $D^{90\%} = 29.97 \pm 0.24\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ with a 1% false alarm rate per 50 mHz, while the model trained on the entire 20-1000 Hz band yields $D^{90\%} = 18.63 \pm 0.24\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. The sensitivities achieved are comparable to state-of-the-art results using deep learning approaches, with less than 50% of the training time and data. We find that sensitivity scales as $T^{0.28 \pm 0.01}$ with total observation time for the attention U-Net trained at 20 Hz, similar to semi-coherent search methods. The neural network demonstrates robustness on datasets with time gaps, with sensitivity dependence on duty factor analyzed. We also investigated the sensitivity dependence of the trained attention U-Net models on sky location. Our findings show that attention U-Net is a scalable and effective approach for all-sky continuous gravitational wave searches.

**Abstract**: Regression of Suspension Violin Modes in KAGRA O3GK Data with Kalman Filters Lucas Moisset, Marco Meyer-Conde, Christopher Allene, Yusuke Sakai, Dan Chen, Nobuyuki Kanda, Hirotaka Takahashi General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det) Suspension thermal modes in interferometric gravitational-wave detectors produce narrow, high-Q spectral lines that can contaminate gravitational searches and bias parameter estimation. In KAGRA, cryogenic mirrors are held by thick suspension fibers, designed to sustain such low-temperature environment, which may further affects inharmonicity modes, fiber dimensions, and mechanical behavior compared to typical interferometers. Remaining a prominent source of narrowband contamination, we implement a Kalman filter to model and track violin lines, building on the methodology introduced in [1], and apply subtraction to KAGRA O3GK data. Using gravitational-wave template injections, we validate that the subtraction preserves matched-filter SNR while effectively suppressing line power. Comparisons of power spectral densities and residual analyses confirm that the method removes deterministic line contributions without introducing waveform distortions. This approach provides a cleaner strain channel for searches and parameter estimation and will become increasingly important for future low-temperature detectors with higher-Q suspensions, such as the Einstein Telescope.

## 11. Gravitational Waves from Magnetars

**Abstract**: Gravitational Waves from Magnetars Chris Kouvaris High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We study the emission of gravitational waves produced by the magnetosphere of magnetars. We argue that several features in the spectrum could facilitate the identification of that source. In addition, in cases of extremely large magnetic fields we demonstrate that this emission can make the braking index of such stars to be well over 3, which is the standard prediction of the magnetic dipole radiation and aligned rotator mechanisms. A similar picture arises if one focuses on the second braking index. Moreover the braking index depends on both the rotational frequency and the strength of the magnetic field in striking difference from the other mechanisms. We also show that gravitational waves can be produced by polar gap regions due to their rapid charge-discharge process that takes place in timescales from nanosec to microsec. This can provide an alternative way to probe magnetars and test the polar gap model.

## 12. Outer Solar System spacecraft to probe the $Œº$Hz gravitational wave frontier

**Abstract**: Outer Solar System spacecraft to probe the $Œº$Hz gravitational wave frontier Matthew McQuinn, Casey McGrath Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The microhertz frequency band of gravitational waves probes the merger of supermassive black holes as well as many other gravitational wave phenomena. However, space-interferometry methods that use test masses would require further development of test-mass isolation systems to detect anticipated astrophysical events. We propose an approach that avoids onboard inertial test masses by situating spacecraft in the low-acceleration environment of the outer Solar System. We show that for Earth-spacecraft and inter-spacecraft distances of $\gtrsim 10$ AU, the accelerations on the spacecraft would be sufficiently small to potentially achieve gravitational wave sensitivities determined by stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds. We further argue, for arm lengths of $10-30$ AU and $\sim 10$ Watt transmissions, that stable phase locks could be achieved with 20 cm mirrors or 5 m radio dishes. We discuss designs that send both laser beams and radio waves between the spacecraft, finding that, despite the $\sim10^4\times$ longer wavelengths, even a design with radio transmissions could reach stochastic background-limited sensitivities at $\lesssim 0.3\times 10^{-4}$ Hz. Operating in the radio significantly reduces many spacecraft design tolerances. Our baseline concepts require two arms to do interferometry. However, if one spacecraft carries a clock with Allan deviations at $10^4$ seconds of $10^{-17}$, a comparable sensitivity could be achieved with a single arm. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of achieving similar gravitational wave sensitivities in a `Doppler tracking' configuration where the single arm is anchored to Earth.

**Abstract**: Induced Gravitational Waves as Cosmic Tracers of Leptogenesis Marco Chianese, Guillem Dom√®nech, Theodoros Papanikolaou, Rome Samanta, Ninetta Saviano 13 pages, 6 figures. v2: supplemental material added High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We demonstrate that induced gravitational waves (IGWs) can naturally emerge within the framework of thermal leptogenesis models, thereby providing a robust probe for exploring this theory at remarkably high energy scales. To illustrate this principle, we put forth a basic leptogenesis model in which an early matter-dominated phase, tracing the leptogenesis scale, enhances the generation of gravitational waves induced by an early structure formation. Leveraging recent N-body and lattice simulation results for IGW computations in the non-linear regime, we show that it is possible to establish a direct link between the frequency and amplitude of these IGWs and the thermal leptogenesis scale.

**Abstract**: Resolving Individual Signals in the Presence of Stochastic Background in Future Pulsar Timing Arrays Kazuya Furusawa, Sachiko Kuroyanagi, Kiyotomo Ichiki 13 pages, 9 figures, accepted in MNRAS Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 543 (2025) 1010-1022 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) observations have reported evidence of a gravitational wave background (GWB). If supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are indeed the primary source of this signal, future PTA observations, such as those from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), are expected to simultaneously capture multiple continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) emitted by bright individual SMBH binaries alongside a gravitational wave background (GWB). To address this anticipated scenario in the SKA era, we revisit the F-statistic, a detection method for single source signals in PTA datasets, and introduce a new modeling that accounts for unresolved GWs as a stochastic GWB. Here, we applied this improved F-statistic to the mock datasets that include both CGW and GWB and evaluated how accurately F-statistic can identify the parameters of CGW. As a result, we demonstrate that our approach can successfully improve the estimation of the sky position and the amplitude of CGW, particularly when the GWB is dominant over white noise. This work serves as an initial step toward developing an efficient and robust algorithm based on the F-statistic for future PTA observations.

## 15. CWT-LSTM Autoencoder: A Novel Approach for Gravitational Wave Detection in LIGO Data

**Abstract**: CWT-LSTM Autoencoder: A Novel Approach for Gravitational Wave Detection in LIGO Data Jericho Cain This paper is the replacement for a previously accepted submission. This paper extends the work of the first, testing the model on real LIGO data rather than synthetic data Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Gravitational wave detection requires sophisticated signal processing to identify weak astrophysical signals buried in instrumental noise. Traditional matched filtering approaches face computational challenges with diverse signal morphologies and non-stationary noise. This work presents a deep learning approach combining Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) preprocessing with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder architecture for gravitational wave detection in synthetic data. The CWT provides optimal time-frequency decomposition capturing chirp evolution and transient characteristics essential for compact binary coalescence identification. The LSTM autoencoder learns compressed representations while maintaining sensitivity to subtle signal features distinguishing true astrophysical events from noise artifacts. We generate realistic synthetic datasets incorporating binary black hole merger signals with masses ranging from 10 to 80 solar masses, embedded in colored Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity. The trained model demonstrates strong performance metrics: 92.3 percent precision, 67.6 percent recall, and 80.6 percent AUC-ROC, with an average precision score of 0.780. These results exceed LIGO's stringent detection thresholds for confident gravitational wave identification. Compared to traditional approaches, the CWT-LSTM autoencoder shows superior ability to maintain low false alarm rates while preserving sensitivity to weak signals. The method's end-to-end learning eliminates hand-crafted features and template banks, offering a promising pathway toward more robust gravitational wave detection systems. The unsupervised nature enables discovery of signals with unknown morphologies, providing complementary "blind search" capability for detecting exotic astrophysical sources and novel physics beyond current theoretical models.

**Abstract**: Probing inflationary gravitational waves with cross-correlations: improved forecasting and validation with simulations Toshiya Namikawa, Irene Abril-Cabezas, Blake D. Sherwin 13 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in Physical Review D Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present a follow-up study to the method recently proposed by Namikawa and Sherwin (2023) to probe gravitational waves using cross-correlations between two cosmic microwave background (CMB) $B$-modes and a large-scale structure tracer. We first improve on the previous forecast by including the impact of CMB component separation and find that, if the tensor-to-scalar ratio is $r=0$, we can achieve $\sigma_r\simeq3.6\times10^{-3}$ by combining upcoming experiments, i.e., LiteBIRD, CMB-S4 and the Advanced Simons Observatory. With a more futuristic experiment, we can achieve even tighter constraints on $r$ if improved delensing can be realized. Using a simulated analysis pipeline, we also explore possible biases from higher-order terms in the lensing potential, which were previously not examined in detail. We find that these bias terms are negligible compared to a detectable signal from inflationary gravitational waves. Our simulated results confirm that this new method is capable of obtaining powerful constraints on $r$. The method is immune to Gaussian Galactic foregrounds and has a different response to non-Gaussian Galactic foregrounds than the $B$-mode power spectrum, offering an independent cross-check of $r$ constraints from the standard power spectrum analysis.

**Abstract**: Biased domain walls: faster annihilation, weaker gravitational waves E. Babichev, I. Dankovsky, D. Gorbunov, S. Ramazanov, A. Vikman 25 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables; version accepted in JCAP High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We study the evolution of domain wall networks and their phenomenological implications in a model of a real scalar $\chi$, where a $Z_2$-symmetry is slightly broken by a potential bias $V_{bias}$. It is demonstrated that the latter triggers domain wall annihilation considerably earlier than previously thought. Namely, we observe that the scaling relation $t_{ann} \propto 1/V^{2/3}_{bias}$ for the annihilation time $t_{ann}$ fits to the simulation data better than a commonly assumed $t_{ann} \propto 1/V_{bias}$. As a result, the energy density of gravitational waves produced by the network of biased domain walls, for a given tiny $V_{bias}$, is suppressed compared to naive expectations. The spectral shape of gravitational waves is similar to that resulting from unbiased domain walls, but with more power in the close-to-maximum ultraviolet part. In the far ultraviolet region, the spectrum of gravitational waves becomes nearly flat; such a plateau has been recognised earlier in the case of unbiased walls. In our investigation we mainly focus on the symmetry breaking potential $V_{breaking} \propto \chi^3$, and argue that no significant modifications of the domain walls evolution take place if one includes higher powers of $\chi$.

**Abstract**: Freeze-in gravitational waves and dark matter in warm inflation Quan Chen, Siyu Jiang, Dayun Qiu, Peilin Chen, Fa Peng Huang Updated version for submission to JCAP High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Recent study [1] has suggested that warm inflation may be realized with Standard Model gauge interaction alone. Motivated by this framework, we investigate the gravitational wave spectrum and graviton-portal dark matter production through the freeze-in process generated during warm inflation scenarios. We perform a comparative analysis for different dissipation terms, focusing on their distinct gravitational wave signatures in the high-frequency regime. Our findings reveal qualitative and quantitative differences in the spectral behavior, offering a preliminary pathway for exploring inflationary and dark matter models through high-frequency gravitational wave signals.

Basak main paper: 12 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Continuous gravitational waves (CWs) emission from neutron stars carries information about their internal structure and equation of state, and it can provide tests of General Relativity. We present a search for CWs from a set of 45 known pulsars in the first part of the fourth LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observing run, known as O4a. We conducted a targeted search for each pulsar using three independent analysis methods considering the single-harmonic and the dual-harmonic emission models. We find no evidence of a CW signal in O4a data for both models and set upper limits on the signal amplitude and on the ellipticity, which quantifies the asymmetry in the neutron star mass distribution. For the single-harmonic emission model, 29 targets have the upper limit on the amplitude below the theoretical spin-down limit. The lowest upper limit on the amplitude is $6.4\!\times\!10^{-27}$ for the young energetic pulsar J0537-6910, while the lowest constraint on the ellipticity is $8.8\!\times\!10^{-9}$ for the bright nearby millisecond pulsar J0437-4715. Additionally, for a subset of 16 targets we performed a narrowband search that is more robust regarding the emission model, with no evidence of a signal. We also found no evidence of non-standard polarizations as predicted by the Brans-Dicke theory.

The black holes are revealed through broad H$\alpha$ emission (FWHM = 430-2920 km/s) without a forbidden-line counterpart in the bright [O III] doublet. Channel maps of the asymmetric central H$\alpha$ profile isolate two spatially distinct broad line regions (BLRs), separated by $190\pm40$ pc, while a third BLR is found in the galaxy outskirts with a projected separation of 1.7 kpc. Using single-epoch virial relations, we estimate black hole masses of $\log(M_\bullet/M_\odot)=7.9\pm0.4$ (primary central), $5.8\pm0.5$ (secondary central) and $6.3\pm0.5$ (third off-nuclear). We argue that the two central black holes will likely rapidly merge, with a simple dynamical friction time estimate of the order of 700 Myr. Assuming that also the off-nuclear black hole is in the process of sinking towards the centre, it will likely lead to a second merger, and we investigate the detection probability of such mergers with LISA. Alternatively, the third black hole may be the result of previous three-body interaction or a gravitational recoil, where our observations would provide evidence that such black holes may retain their accretion discs and BLRs even in the aftermath of such extreme dynamical interactions. The discovery of a black hole triplet at high redshift, together with other recent results on distant black hole pairs, indicates that multiple massive black hole systems were common in the early Universe. Our results highlight the importance of IFU observations for the detection of massive black hole multiplets in distant galaxies, the progenitors of massive black hole mergers that may be detected with next-generation gravitational wave observatories.
