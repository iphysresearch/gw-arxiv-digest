**Abstract**: Effects of multidimensional treatment of gravity in simulations on supernova gravitational waves Hajime Sotani, Bernhard M√ºller, Tomoya Takiwaki Accepted for publication in PRD General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Supernova explosions are expected as one of the promising candidates for gravitational wave sources. In this study, we examine the supernova gravitational waves, focusing on the multidimensional treatment of gravity in the simulation. For this purpose, we newly performed two-dimensional relativistic simulations with a nonmonopole (two-dimensional) potential and compared the resultant gravitational wave signals in the simulations with the frequencies of the proto-neutron stars with and without the Cowling approximation. Then, we find that the proto-neutron star frequencies with the Cowling approximation overestimate the gravitational wave frequencies. On the other hand, the frequencies of the proto-neutron star oscillations with metric perturbations agree well with the gravitational wave signals in the simulations. Employing the new data, we derive a new fitting formula for the supernova gravitational wave frequencies with the two-dimensional gravitational potential, independently of the progenitor mass. Combining this new formula with the previous one derived from the Cowling approximation, we also derive the formula to predict the gravitational wave frequencies with a two-dimensional potential, using those with a monopole potential.

**Abstract**: Toward a Theory of Gravitational Wave Turbulence Holly Krynicki, Jiaxi Wu, Elias R. Most General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) General relativity describes the dynamics of gravitational waves, which can feature nonlinear interactions, such as those underlying turbulent processes. Theoretical and numerical explorations have demonstrated the existence of gravitational wave turbulence, of which a full and general mathematical description is currently not known. Here, we take essential steps towards such a theory. Leveraging a formulation exactly recasting general relativity as a set of nonlinear electrodynamics equations, we demonstrate that general relativity admits an Elsasser formulation -- the same type of equation underpinning magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We further show that nonlinear interactions described by this equation are in part Alfv√©nic, linking gravitational wave turbulence to Alfv√©nic turbulence. Our work paves the way for a new understanding of nonlinear gravitational wave dynamics through insights from magnetohydrodynamics.

## 3. Attention U-Net for all-sky continuous gravitational wave searches

**Abstract**: Attention U-Net for all-sky continuous gravitational wave searches Damon H. T. Cheung General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det) Detecting continuous gravitational waves is challenging due to the high computational cost of template-based searches across large parameter spaces, particularly for all-sky searches. Machine learning offers a promising solution to perform these searches with reasonable computational resources. In this study, we trained an attention U-Net, a convolutional neural network, on $\approx$ 10.67 days of simulated data with Gaussian noise for all-sky searches at different frequencies within the 20-1000 Hz band. Our model trained at 20 Hz achieves the best sensitivity, with a 90% detection efficiency sensitivity depth $D^{90\%} = 29.97 \pm 0.24\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ with a 1% false alarm rate per 50 mHz, while the model trained on the entire 20-1000 Hz band yields $D^{90\%} = 18.63 \pm 0.24\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. The sensitivities achieved are comparable to state-of-the-art results using deep learning approaches, with less than 50% of the training time and data. We find that sensitivity scales as $T^{0.28 \pm 0.01}$ with total observation time for the attention U-Net trained at 20 Hz, similar to semi-coherent search methods. The neural network demonstrates robustness on datasets with time gaps, with sensitivity dependence on duty factor analyzed. We also investigated the sensitivity dependence of the trained attention U-Net models on sky location. Our findings show that attention U-Net is a scalable and effective approach for all-sky continuous gravitational wave searches.

**Abstract**: "Chat" between extreme mass ratio inspirals and Galactic binaries in LISA data Sviatoslav Khukhlaev, Stanislav Babak General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The future space-based gravitational wave observatory, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, is expected to observe between a few and a few thousand extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) per year. Due to the simultaneous presence of other gravitational wave signals in the data, it can be challenging to detect EMRIs and accurately estimate their parameters. In this work, we investigate the interaction between a gravitational signal from an EMRI and millions of signals from inspiralling Galactic white dwarf binaries. We demonstrate that bright Galactic binaries contaminate the detection and characterization of EMRIs. We perform Bayesian inference of EMRI parameters after removing resolvable Galactic binaries and confirm an accuracy comparable to that expected in Gaussian noise.

It employs numerical linear algebra and meshfree approximation techniques to expedite waveform generation and likelihood evaluation, crucial for estimating binary parameters like masses, spins, distance, and sky location. The thesis demonstrates the effectiveness of these methods through simulations and real GW events, highlighting their potential for multimessenger astronomy and future gravitational wave observatories.

**Abstract**: Inter-Spacecraft Tilt-to-Length Noise Reduction Algorithm for Taiji Mission Qiong Deng, Leiqiao Ye, Ke An, Yidi Fan, Ruihong Gao, Ziren Luo, Minghui Du, Pengcheng Wang, Peng Xu General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The Taiji mission for space-based gravitational wave (GW) detection employs laser interferometry to measure picometer-scale distance variations induced by GWs. The tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling noise in the inter-spacecraft interferometers, which originates from the angular jitters of the spacecrafts and the movable optical subassemblies, is predicted to be one of the main noise sources that might reduce Taiji's sensitivity to GWs. Since these angular jitters can be read out through the differential wavefront sensors, it is possible to suppress TTL noise during the data processing stage by fitting and subtracting it. This paper proposes an improved algorithm for TTL noise suppression, which addresses the issue of unknown noise floor required for optimal estimation in the practical detection scenario, and the design of this algorithm takes into account the presence of GW signals. The algorithm is validated via numerical simulation, which is built on a spacecraft dynamics simulation incorporating Taiji's drag-free and attitude control system. We also demonstrate the robustness of this algorithm by varying TTL coefficients at different levels, indicating that our algorithm is applicable to a range of payload statuses, and ultimately providing a critical advancement toward realizing Taiji's full sensitivity.

**Abstract**: Where did heavy binaries go? Gravitational-wave populations using Delaunay triangulation with optimized complexity Rodrigo Tenorio, Alexandre Toubiana, Tristan Bruel, Davide Gerosa, Jonathan R. Gair High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate the joint mass-redshift evolution of the binary black hole merger rate in the latest gravitational-wave detection catalog, GWTC-4.0. We present and apply a novel non-parametric framework for modeling multi-dimensional, correlated distributions based on Delaunay triangulation. Crucially, the complexity of the model -- namely, the number, positions, and weights of triangulation nodes -- is inferred directly from the data, resulting in a highly efficient approach that requires about one to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters and significantly less calibration than current state-of-the-art methods. We find no evidence for a peak at $M_{\mathrm{tot}} \sim 70\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ at low redshift ($z \sim 0.2$), where it would correspond to the $m_1 \sim 35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ feature reported in redshift-independent mass spectrum analyses, and we infer an increased merger rate at high redshift $(z \sim 1)$ around those masses, compatible with such a peak. We discuss the astrophysical implications of these results.

**Abstract**: Constraining the EdGB Theory with Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals Jing Tan, Jian-dong Zhang, Hui-Min Fan, Jianwei Mei 8 page, 3 figures, matches the published version General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) theory is a modified theory of gravity which include a scalar field to couple with the higher order curvature terms. It has already been constrained with various observations include the gravitational wave (GW) with LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration. In this work, we study the capability for space-borne GW detectors to constrain the EdGB theory using the signal of Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspiral (EMRIs). We use the "numerical kludge (NK)" method to construct the waveform of EMRI in the EdGB theory, focusing on the case when the central black hole is spinless. We then study how a future space-borne gravitational wave detector, TianQin, for example, can place constraints on the EdGB theory through the detection of EMRIs. With the analysis using mismatch and Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), we find that the EdGB parameter $\sqrt{\alpha}$ is expected to be constrained to the level of $\sim\mathcal{O}(0.1)$ km.

## 9. Distinguish the environmental effects and modified theory of gravity with multiple massive black-hole binaries

**Abstract**: Distinguish the environmental effects and modified theory of gravity with multiple massive black-hole binaries Xulong Yuan, Jian-dong Zhang, Jianwei Mei 10 pages,10 figures, matches the published version General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In the typical data analysis and waveform modeling of the gravitational waves (GWs) signals for binary black holes (BBHs), it is assumed to be isolate sources in the vacuum within the theory of general relativity (GR). However, various kinds of matter may exist around the source or on the path to the detector, and there also exist many different kinds of modified theories of gravity. The effects of these modifications can be characterized within the parametrized post-Einstein (ppE) framework, and the corresponding phase corrections on the waveform at leading post-Newtonian (PN) order are also expressed by the additional parameters for these effects. In this work, we consider the varying-G theory and the dynamical friction of the dark matter spike as an example. Both of these two effects will modify the waveform at -4PN order, if we choose the suitable power law index for the spike. We choose to use a statistic to characterize the dispersion between the posterior of $\dot G$ for different events. For different astronomical models, we find that this statistic can distinguish these two models very effectively. This result indicates that we could use this statistic to distinguish other degenerate effects with the detection of multiple sources.

**Abstract**: Toward Second-Order Self-Force for Eccentric Extreme-Mass Ratio Inspirals in Schwarzschild Spacetime Yi-Xiang Wei, Xian-Long Zhu, Jian-dong Zhang, Jianwei Mei 18 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, matches the published version General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) An Extreme Mass Ratio Inspiral (EMRI), which corresponds to a small compact object inspirals around a massive black hole in the center of a galaxy, is one of the most important sources for future space-borne gravitational-wave (GW) detectors such as TianQin and LISA. By analyzing the emitted GW signals, we can probe the theory of gravity and the nature of black holes in the strong field region. To achieve these objectives, the second-order self-force effect should be considered in the waveform modeling. Up to now, the waveform of EMRIs including the second-order self-force effect is only achieved for the circular orbit on Schwarzschild background. In this work, we generalized the calculation of the second-order self-force to the eccentric orbits on Schwarzschild spacetime. We calculated the puncture field, and give the form of two-timescale expansion for the field equations. The corresponding numerical calculation and programming can be performed based on these results.

## 11. Inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms with gravitational self-force results within the effective-one-body formalism

**Abstract**: Inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms with gravitational self-force results within the effective-one-body formalism Benjamin Leather, Alessandra Buonanno, Maarten van de Meent 26 pages, 10 figures; updated to reflect published version General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Gravitational self-force (GSF) theory is a strong-gravity perturbative approach to the relativistic two-body problem, primarily developed to model extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, where one compact object is significantly more massive than the companion. However, recent advancements in GSF calculations, particularly involving second-order self-force (2GSF) results, indicated a much broader applicability across a wider range of mass ratios. These developments have motivated efforts to incorporate GSF results into the effective-one-body (EOB) framework, where they have already been successfully integrated into the state-of-the-art waveform model, SEOBNRv5, employed in recent LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observing runs. In this work, we present SEOBNR-GSF, a nonspinning inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) EOB waveform model that introduces a GSF-informed EOB Hamiltonian as its central innovation. This marks the first complete IMR waveform model constructed primarily from GSF results. We show that our model outperforms inspiral waveforms from full 2GSF calculations in the intermediate-to-comparable mass regime. Furthermore, by comparing with a post-Newtonian-informed variant, SEOBNR-GSF-PN, we demonstrate that the inclusion of numerical GSF information in the Hamiltonian leads to significant improvements in model fidelity. Finally, we benchmark our model against high-accuracy, nonspinning numerical-relativity simulations from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) catalogue and find that its median mismatch is comparable to that of SEOBNRv5, suggesting that this approach holds promise for further enhancing future EOB waveform models.

**Abstract**: Detectability of massive binary black holes with sub-mHz gravitational wave missions Renjie Wang, Yumeng Xu, Gang Wang, Bin Hu, Rong-Gen Cai 18 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in PRD General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Beyond LISA, proposed space-based gravitational wave (GW) missions aim to explore the sub-millihertz to microhertz frequency band, with one key objective being the detection of massive binary black hole (MBBH) mergers across cosmic distances. In this work, we investigate the detection and localization capabilities of future sub-mHz GW observatories for MBBH coalescences. Including the full galactic foreground noise, we find that signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) can reach several thousand across a wide range of redshifts. We evaluate three representative orbital configurations--non-precessing and precessing with different inclination angles--and analyze their localization performance for various MBBH populations. In the non-precessing case, a two-hemisphere degeneracy arises when only the dominant (2,2) mode is considered, which is effectively resolved by including higher-order modes. These modes contribute to a more uniform performance across all configurations, thereby mitigating the prior advantage of precessing mission orbits. Sub-mHz missions operating in the [10 $\mu$Hz, 10 mHz] band partially overlap with LISA's range but provide enhanced sensitivity to lower-frequency GWs due to their longer interferometric baselines. This results in significantly improved localization of high-mass MBBHs, enhancing the prospects for multi-messenger astronomy and precision cosmology. Moreover, the high SNRs attainable with sub-mHz detectors could enable stringent tests of general relativity and alternative theories of gravity.

**Abstract**: Perturbative Hyperboloidal Extraction of Gravitational Waves in 3+1 Numerical Relativity Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Joan Fontbut√©, Simone Albanesi, Anil Zenginoƒülu General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a framework to propagate to null infinity gravitational waves computed at timelike worldtubes in the interior of a 3+1 (Cauchy) numerical relativity simulations. In our method, numerical relativity data are used as the inner inflowing boundary of a perturbative time-domain Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli simulation in hyperboloidal coordinates that reaches null infinity. We showcase waveforms from (3+1)D simulations of gravitational collapse of rotating neutron stars, binary black holes mergers and scattering, and binary neutron star mergers and compare them to other extrapolation methods. Our perturbative hyperboloidal extraction provides a simple yet efficient procedure to compute gravitational waves with data quality comparable to the Cauchy characteristic extraction for several practical applications. Nonlinear effects in the wave propagation are not captured by our method, but the present work is a stepping stone towards more sophisticated hyperboloidal schemes for gravitational-wave extraction.

**Abstract**: Quantum Computing Tools for Fast Detection of Gravitational Waves in the Context of LISA Space Mission Maria-Catalina Isfan, Laurentiu-Ioan Caramete, Ana Caramete, Daniel Tonoiu, Alexandru Nicolin-Zaczek Submitted to Classical and Quantum Gravity General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an) The field of gravitational wave (GW) detection is progressing rapidly, with several next-generation observatories on the horizon, including LISA. GW data is challenging to analyze due to highly variable signals shaped by source properties and the presence of complex noise. These factors emphasize the need for robust, advanced analysis tools. In this context, we have initiated the development of a low-latency GW detection pipeline based on quantum neural networks (QNNs). Previously, we demonstrated that QNNs can recognize GWs simulated using post-Newtonian approximations in the Newtonian limit. We then extended this work using data from the LISA Consortium, training QNNs to distinguish between noisy GW signals and pure noise. Currently, we are evaluating performance on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset and comparing it against classical methods. Our results show that QNNs can reliably distinguish GW signals embedded in noise, achieving classification accuracies above 98\%. Notably, our QNN identified 5 out of 6 mergers in the Sangria blind dataset. The remaining merger, characterized by the lowest amplitude, highlights an area for future improvement in model sensitivity. This can potentially be addressed using additional mock training datasets, which we are preparing, and by testing different QNN architectures and ansatzes.

**Abstract**: Blackhole perturbations in the Modified Generalized Chaplygin Gas model Sunil Singh Bohra General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We study blackhole in the Modified Generalized Chaplygin Gas (MGCG) model, a modified gravity framework proposed to unify dark matter and dark energy. The resulting spacetime is asymptotically non-flat and feature two distinct horizons, determined by the Chaplygin parameter $\alpha$. Observational constraints favor negative values of $\alpha$, which restrict the allowed parameter space. Through linear perturbation analysis, we show that this blackhole remain stable under both scalar and electromagnetic perturbation. The corresponding quasinormal mode spectra depend sensitively on the MGCG parameters, indicating that this cosmological model leaves characteristic imprints on blackhole oscillations. These results suggest that gravitational-wave observations of blackhole ringdowns may provide a means of constraining MGCG and testing unified dark sector scenarios in the strong-field regime.

**Abstract**: Gravitational Waves from Hyperbolic Encounters of Primordial Black Holes in Dwarf Galaxies Tadeo D. G√≤mez-Aguilar, Encieh Erfani, N. M. Jim√®nez Cruz Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by primordial black holes (PBHs) in the dense cores of dwarf galaxies (DGs), considering both hierarchical binary black hole (BBH) mergers and close hyperbolic encounters (CHEs). Extending our previous merger framework, we incorporate up to four successive generations of PBHs within a Hubble time and quantify the GW emission from both channels. Our results show that while BBHs dominate the total emission, CHEs occur earlier, provide the first GW signals, and contribute a continuous though subdominant background that becomes relatively more significant once the initial PBH population is depleted and binary formation is suppressed. We compute the resulting SGWB spectra, demonstrating that BBHs and CHEs imprint distinct frequency dependencies consistent with analytical expectations. We then compare the predicted signals with the sensitivity of observatories such as LISA, DECIGO, ET, IPTA, and SKA. The numerical implementation is publicly available at \href{this https URL}.

## 17. Dark Matter and Electroweak Baryogenesis with Spontaneous $CP$ Violation in the Early Universe

**Abstract**: Dark Matter and Electroweak Baryogenesis with Spontaneous $CP$ Violation in the Early Universe Subhojit Roy High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex) Dark matter (DM) and the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU) are among the most compelling indications of physics beyond the Standard Model. We revisit the inelastic Higgs-portal complex singlet, a minimal framework in which a complex scalar splits into two nearly degenerate real states, with an off-diagonal Higgs-portal interaction that drives coannihilation to set the relic density, while the elastic DM-Higgs coupling can be tuned small enough to evade direct-detection limits. This setup naturally supports a strong first-order electroweak phase transition (SFOEWPT) and can account for the long-standing Galactic Center gamma-ray excess (GCE) via present-day DM annihilation into Higgs pairs. In this work, we show that the same framework, extended by a $Z_2$-symmetric dimension-6 $CP$-violating top Yukawa operator, can also generate the BAU via the electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) mechanism. The cosmological history involves a two-step electroweak phase transition: first, the singlet fields acquire nonzero vacuum expectation values (vevs); then a strongly first-order transition occurs in which the Higgs develops its nonzero vev while the singlet vevs vanish. During this second step, both fields remain nonzero only within the advancing bubble wall, generating wall-localized $CP$ violation that biases sphaleron transitions and enables EWBG. After the phase transition, $CP$ and $Z_2$ symmetries are restored: the lightest singlet state becomes a stable DM candidate, while the vanishing singlet vevs allow the model to naturally satisfy the stringent constraints on $CP$ violation. We delineate the SFOEWPT-favored parameter space, identifying the criteria for the two-step phase transition region that simultaneously yields the observed BAU and relic density, explains the GCE, and predicts gravitational wave spectra accessible to next-generation space-based detectors.

**Abstract**: Listening Across the Cosmic Time: Standard Sirens from Ground- and Space-Based Missions in the Next Decade Alberto Salvarese, Hsin-Yu Chen, Alberto Mangiagli, Nicola Tamanini Invited article for the Classical and Quantum Gravity special issue "Gravitational Wave Physics and Astrophysics Ten Years After GW150914" Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Precise measurement of the Hubble parameter will enable stringent tests of the standard model for cosmology. Standard sirens, using the luminosity distances measured by gravitational-wave observations of compact binary mergers, are expected to provide such measurements independently in the next decade. With the ground- and space-based gravitational wave observatories, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), different types of standard sirens altogether will place constraints across a wide redshift range. In this paper, we forecast the precisions of standard siren Hubble parameter measurements and compare various scenarios, accounting for the dominant sources of systematic uncertainty. Specifically, we find a $2\%$ constraint on $H_0$, a $1.5-3\%$ constraint on $H(z)$ at $z=1$, and a $3-5\%$ constraint on $H(z)$ at $z=7$ when combining LVK and LISA standard sirens with precise redshift measurements from electromagnetic counterpart observations. We do not find a significant improvement when including standard sirens with no EM counterpart, but which rely on features in the black hole mass distribution, and the potential systematics introduced by the possible redshift evolution of such features could further degrade the measurement accuracy if not properly accounted for.

**Abstract**: Gravitational waves from magnetorotational core-collapse supernovae using 3D GRMHD simulations: effect of rotation and magnetic fields Sophia C. Schnauck, Swapnil Shankar, Philipp M√∂sta, Roland Haas, Erik Schnetter High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We investigate the gravitational wave emission for 10 supernova progenitors from magnetorotational core-collapse to the supernova explosion using fully three-dimensional dynamical-spacetime general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations with the GPU-accelerated code $\texttt{GRaM-X}$. We consider 2 progenitors of zero-age-main-sequence mass $25M_\odot$ and 8 with zero-age-main-sequence masses of $35M_\odot$. For these models, we explore a range of rotation rates between $0.0$ and $3.5 \mathrm{rad}\, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, along with initial seed magnetic field of either $10^{12}\mathrm{G}$ or $10^{13}\mathrm{G}$. The analysis of the 10 models presented provides a comprehensive and systematic initial investigation of the interplay between progenitor rotation, magnetic field strength, and progenitor structure in shaping the explosion dynamics and gravitational wave (GW) emission. We find that stronger seed magnetic fields ($10^{13}\mathrm{G}$) suppress the GW strain amplitude relative to models with weaker initial fields ($10^{12}\mathrm{G}$). Increasing the initial rotation rate results in a more dynamical explosion, yielding correspondingly stronger gravitational waves. In addition, the progenitor mass/composition also exhibit a significant impact on the explosion dynamics and the morphology of the resulting waveforms. Finally, we find that all of our models lie above the detectability threshold for 3rd generation detectors aLIGO, Einstein Telescope, and Cosmic explorer at a $10\mathrm{kpc}$ distance and most would even still be detectable at $10\mathrm{Mpc}$, opening the possibility for observing gravitational wave emission for CCSNe beyond our galaxy.

**Abstract**: McFACTS II: Mass Ratio--Effective Spin Relationship of Black Hole Mergers in the AGN Channel Harrison E. Cook, Barry McKernan, K.E. Saavik Ford, Vera Delfavero, Kaila Nathaniel, Jake Postiglione, Shawn Ray, Richard O'Shaughnessy Submitted to ApJ, 18 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We use the Monte Carlo For AGN (active galactic nucleus) Channel Testing and Simulation (McFACTS, this https URL) code to study the effect of AGN disk and nuclear star cluster parameters on predicted mass distributions for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) compact binaries forming in AGN disks. The assumptions we vary include the black hole (BH) initial mass function, disk model, disk size, disk lifetime, and the prograde-to-retrograde fraction of newly formed black hole binaries. Broadly we find that dense, moderately short-lived AGN disks are preferred for producing a $(q,\chi_{\rm eff})$ anti-correlation like those identified from existing gravitational wave (GW) observations. Additionally, a BH initial mass function (MF $\propto M^{-2}$) is preferred over a more top-heavy MF ($M^{-1}$). The preferred fraction of prograde-to-retrograde is $>90\%$, to produce results consistent with observations.

Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) X-ray flashes (XRFs) are fast X-ray transients thought to be softer analogs of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). With its soft X-ray sensitivity, the Einstein Probe (EP) provides a unique opportunity to study these events. We report multiwavelength observations of EP241021a, a soft X-ray transient detected by EP, and interpret its afterglow in the context of leading XRF models. The prompt emission was observed by EP-WXT and Fermi-GBM, followed by a broad campaign across radio (uGMRT, ATCA, e-MERLIN, ALMA), optical (LBT, GTC, CAHA), and X-rays (EP-FXT). Light curves and spectra were analyzed with both empirical and physical models of GRBs and spherical expansions (both nonrelativistic and mildly relativistic cocoons). The afterglow shows multiple components, consistent with a structured jet interacting with a complex environment. The early optical and X-ray decline is explained by wide, low-Lorentz-factor ($\gamma \sim 40$) wings, while a rebrightening at approximately 7 days arises from the off-axis jet core. Radio data require an additional mildly relativistic cocoon ($\gamma \sim 2$), and a late (70 days) spectral component peaking at 50 GHz suggests a second, slower cocoon ($\gamma \sim 1$).
