**Abstract**: Matter environments around black holes: geodesics, light rings and ultracompact configurations Dylan S. Fonseca, Caio F. B. Macedo, Mateus Malato Corrêa, Diego Rubiera-Garcia General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Astrophysical black holes are invariably embedded in matter environments whose gravitational influence can alter key strong-field features of the spacetime. In this work, we investigate the impact of spherically symmetric dark-matter distributions on black hole geometry, geodesic structure, and ringdown phenomenology. Modeling the surrounding matter through Einstein clusters, we construct self-consistent spacetimes for three widely used density profiles - the Hernquist, Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), and Jaffe models - and examine how their near-horizon behavior modifies the location and stability of circular timelike and null geodesics, including the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and light rings. In the low-compactness regime, we derive analytical expressions showing that environmental effects generically shift the ISCO inward and the principal light ring outward, leading to parametric deviations in their associated orbital frequencies and Lyapunov exponents. At higher compactness, we explore the emergence of additional light rings, marginally stable orbits, and secondary horizons, identifying the regions of parameter space in which these ultracompact configurations arise. Using time-domain evolutions of scalar perturbations, we demonstrate how such structures can imprint characteristic signatures on the ringdown signal, including long-lived trapped modes and echo-like modulations associated with multiple potential barriers. Our results provide a unified framework for assessing environmental effects around black holes and highlight the importance of matter-induced corrections for interpreting upcoming electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations.

**Abstract**: When spacetime vibrates: An introduction to gravitational waves José P. S. Lemos Invited contribution to the special edition of the Portuguese Physical Society's Gazeta de Física dedicated to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the first detection of gravitational waves. 42 pages, 18 figures General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the physics of gravitational waves, exploring both the theoretical foundations and the most recent experimental advances. After a general introduction to the theory of general relativity and its major implications, the article discusses the history of gravitational waves, from their prediction by Einstein to their actual detection. It then explains what gravitational waves are and how they interact with appropriate detectors. The main mechanisms of gravitational radiation emission are analyzed, with a focus on compact binary systems of compact objects, whose orbits typically evolve in three phases: inspiral, merger, and the final ringdown phase, each of these phases leaving distinct signatures in the emitted waves. The article highlights the fundamental role of the giant interferometers LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, true cathedrals of modern science, and revisits the historic event GW150914, the first direct detection of gravitational waves, which confirmed the predictions of general relativity and opened a new era for astronomy. This achievement was recognized with the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Other observed events are also discussed, along with their astrophysical sources, and the possibility of detecting gravitational waves of cosmological origin, originating from the Big Bang itself. Finally, current and future projects are analyzed, including observatories based on increasingly sophisticated interferometers, as well as proposals for alternative detection methods, illustrating how gravitational-wave astronomy is shaping the present and future of our exploration of the universe. In concluding, the detection of gravitational waves is set in a broader context by examining the discoveries across the electromagnetic spectrum, thereby illustrating the complementary perspectives these different observational channels provide.

**Abstract**: Constraining the dynamical Chern-Simons gravity with future gravitational wave detectors Xinyi Che, Xiangyu Lyu, Changfu Shi General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, a parity-violating modification of general relativity, is regarded as a low-energy effective theory arising from string theory. Gravitational waves provide a powerful probe for testing its predictions. However, current gravitational wave observations are unable to place meaningful constraints on this theory through phase measurements, due to limitations from detector noise and the validity requirements of the waveform models. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of the prospects for constraining the dynamical Chern-Simons gravity with future gravitational-wave detectors using stellar mass black holes binary. We quantify how the constraining capacities vary across different detectors and source parameters, and identify the regions of parameter space that satisfy the small-coupling condition. Furthermore, by incorporating an astrophysically motivated mass distribution model for stellar mass black hole binaries, we estimate the potential of upcoming observatories.

## 4. Multi-messenger detectability of continuous gravitational waves from the near future to next generation detectors

**Abstract**: Multi-messenger detectability of continuous gravitational waves from the near future to next generation detectors Benjamin J. Owen (1 and 2), Binod Rajbhandari (1 and 2 and 3) ((1) Texas Tech University, (2) University of Maryland Baltimore County, (3) Rochester Institute of Technology) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Continuous gravitational waves have the potential to transform gravitational wave astronomy and yield fresh insights into astrophysics, nuclear and particle physics, and condensed matter physics. We evaluate their detectability by combining various theoretical and observational arguments from the literature and systematically applying those arguments to known astronomical objects and future gravitational wave detectors. We detail and update previous estimates made in support of Cosmic Explorer [M. Evans et al., arXiv:2306.13745; I. Gupta et al., Class. Quantum Grav. 41, 245001 (2024)]. It is commonly argued that the spins of accreting neutron stars are regulated by gravitational wave emission and that millisecond pulsars contain a young pulsar's magnetic field buried under accreted material. If either of these arguments holds, the first detection of continuous gravitational waves is likely with near future upgrades of current detectors, and many detections are likely with next generation detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. A lack of detections in the next several years would begin to raise serious doubts about current theories of millisecond pulsar formation.

## 5. Colloquium: Multimessenger astronomy with continuous gravitational waves and future detectors

**Abstract**: Colloquium: Multimessenger astronomy with continuous gravitational waves and future detectors Benjamin J. Owen 13 pages, 4 figures, to appear in Rev. Mod. Phys General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Continuous gravitational waves from rapidly rotating neutron stars are on the new frontiers of gravitational wave astrophysics and have strong connections to electromagnetic astronomy, nuclear astrophysics, and condensed matter physics. In this Colloquium I survey prospects for detection of continuous gravitational waves from various neutron star populations, especially aided by electromagnetic observations. Although there are caveats, current theories and observations suggest that the first detections are likely within a few years, and that many are likely in the era of next generation detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. I also survey what can be learned from these signals, each one of which will contain more cycles than all the compact binary mergers ever detected. Since continuous gravitational wave emission mechanisms depend on aspects of neutron star physics, such as crustal elasticity, which are not well constrained by current astronomical observations and physical experiments, their detection can tell us a great deal that is new about extreme matter. Even more can be learned by combining gravitational wave observations with data from the Square Kilometre Array, the Next Generation Very Large Array, FAST, and other electromagnetic detectors operating in the next generation era.

## 6. Mass distribution of ultralight boson in binary black hole systems

**Abstract**: Mass distribution of ultralight boson in binary black hole systems Hang Yang, Daiqin Su General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Ultralight bosons are compelling dark-matter candidates. Both scalar and vector bosons can be produced through black hole superradiance, forming a boson cloud surrounding a rotating black hole. Self-interaction of bosons, together with transition mixing in binary black hole systems, give rise to dynamical phenomena that could be potentially observable with future gravitational wave observations. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of bosons in binary black hole systems. In particular, we focus on boson mass transfer in unequal-mass binary black hole systems with arbitrary spin-orientation of the companion. Our results show that the mass ratio between the companion and the primary black holes significantly affects cloud absorption through mass transfer. Moreover, when the companion's spin is not aligned with that of the primary, the efficiency of cloud depletion is further modified.

**Abstract**: The new generation lunar gravitational wave detectors: sky map resolution and joint analysis Xiaolin Zhang, Chengye Yu, Haoran Li, Sobhan Kazempour, Mingqiu Li, Sichun Sun General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det) Lunar-based gravitational-wave interferometry is a fascinating endeavor, and was proposed as a promising approach to bridge the observational gap between space-borne and ground-based detectors. In this work, we adopt the Fisher-matrix method to examine the angular-resolution performance of the newly proposed Crater Interferometry Gravitational-wave Observatory (CIGO) on the lunar crater rim near the north pole, together with TianQin and LISA, for monochromatic sources in the 0.1-10 Hz band. We find that above 0.1 Hz, CIGO achieves better localization accuracy than the other two space-based missions and dominates the combined detector network's performance, provided that lunar noise mitigation is achieved in the 0.1-2.87 Hz frequency range. We further explore an upgraded Tetrahedron configuration, TCIGO, with a fourth station at the bottom of a crater, which forms a regular tetrahedral constellation on the lunar surface. The result shows that TCIGO yields a five-fold improvement in angular-resolution capability over CIGO and gets better sky coverage across the target frequency band.

**Abstract**: Schwinger-Keldysh Cosmological Cutting Rules Francisco Colipí-Marchant, Gabriel Marin, Gonzalo A. Palma, Francisco Rojas High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this work, we study the realisation of unitarity-based cutting rules for primordial cosmological correlators computed within the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral formalism. While cutting rules have been previously derived for wavefunction coefficients, here we examine them directly at the level of cosmological observables expressed diagrammatically. The resulting rules closely resemble those familiar from flat-space scattering amplitudes, but with an additional subtlety: in order to express the discontinuity of a correlator as the product of lower-order correlators, one must introduce a specific combinations of diagrams which do not appear in the computation of observables themselves. We explicitly verify these rules for several classes of correlators, both at tree level and with loop corrections, arising from theories involving different types of interactions.

## 9. Quasinormal modes of Kerr-like black bounce spacetime

**Abstract**: Quasinormal modes of Kerr-like black bounce spacetime Yi Yang, Dong Liu, Ali Övgün, Zheng-Wen Long, Zhaoyi Xu General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum of a Kerr-like black-bounce spacetime under massive scalar-field perturbations. Starting from the Kerr-like deformation of the Simpson--Visser black-bounce geometry, we derive the corresponding radial and angular equations and obtain the effective potential governing scalar perturbations. We show that the Kerr-like black-bounce spacetime inherits a characteristic double-peaked effective potential, analogous to the Schwarzschild-like black-bounce case, which is known to be associated with late-time echo signals. The QNM frequencies are computed by means of the Pöschl--Teller potential approximation and the semi-analytic WKB method (up to sixth order), and we demonstrate good agreement between these two approaches. We then analyze in detail how the QNM spectrum depends on the spin parameter $a$, the bounce parameter $p$ that interpolates between black-hole and wormhole geometries, and the scalar-field mass $\mu$. Our results indicate that increasing either $a$ or $p$ lowers both the real frequency and the magnitude of the imaginary part, leading to longer-lived modes. Moreover, the mass of the scalar field has a non-negligible impact on the ringdown spectrum. These features suggest that rotating black-bounce geometries may leave distinct imprints in the ringdown phase of gravitational-wave signals, and motivate future studies of echoes and parameter estimation in the context of present and upcoming detectors.

**Abstract**: Angular momentum and memory effect Pujian Mao, Jun-Bao Wu, Xiaoning Wu Phys. Rev. D 107, L101501 (2023) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) It is a long-standing problem in general relativity that the notion of angular momentum of an isolated system has supertranslation ambiguity. In this paper, we argue that the ambiguity is essentially because of the gravitational wave memory. When properly subtracting the memory effect of the observer, one can introduce a supertranslation invariant definition of the angular momentum at null infinity.

## 11. Theory-agnostic searches for non-gravitational modes in black hole ringdown

**Abstract**: Theory-agnostic searches for non-gravitational modes in black hole ringdown Francesco Crescimbeni, Xisco Jimenez Forteza, Swetha Bhagwat, Julian Westerweck, Paolo Pani 10 pages, 9 figures. Accepted in SciPost Physics General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) In any extension of General Relativity (GR), extra fundamental degrees of freedom couple to gravity. Besides deforming GR forecasts in a theory-dependent way, this coupling generically introduces extra modes in the gravitational-wave signal. We propose a novel theory-agnostic test of gravity to search for these nongravitational modes in black hole merger ringdown signals. To leading order in the GR deviations, their frequencies and damping times match those of a test scalar or vector field in a Kerr background, with only amplitudes and phases as free parameters. By applying this test to GW150914, GW190521, and GW200129, we find no strong evidence for an extra mode; however, its inclusion modifies the inferred distribution of the remnant spin. This test will be applicable for future detectors, which will achieve signal-to-noise ratios higher than 100 (and as high as 1000 for space-based detectors such as LISA). Such sensitivity will allow measurement of these modes with amplitude ratios as low as 0.02 for ground-based detectors (and as low as 0.003 for LISA), relative to the fundamental mode, enabling stringent agnostic constraints or detection of scalar/vector modes.

## 12. Gravitational Wave Backreaction in $f(R,G)$ Gravity

**Abstract**: Gravitational Wave Backreaction in $f(R,G)$ Gravity Farzad Milani 39 pages, No figure, 6 appendices, 28 references General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for gravitational wave (GW) propagation and their \textbf{nonlinear backreaction} in $f(R, G)$ modified gravity. By developing a scalar-tensor formulation with two auxiliary fields, we systematically investigate both the propagation and backreaction of high-frequency gravitational waves in cosmological backgrounds. Within this framework, we derive, for the first time, the complete effective energy-momentum tensor for GWs in $f(R, G)$ theory. The linearized field equations reveal how the Gauss-Bonnet term introduces new curvature-dependent couplings between tensor and scalar degrees of freedom, leading to modified dispersion relations and distinctive wave propagation effects. On de Sitter backgrounds, we obtain exact decoupled equations for the tensor and scalar modes, demonstrating how the additional $G$ dependence alters both the effective masses and energy transport mechanisms compared to the well-established framework of pure $f(R)$ theories. Our derivation of the effective energy-momentum tensor extends Isaacson's approach to incorporate the novel scalar field contributions, revealing a complex hierarchy of characteristic length scales ($\lambda$, $\ell$, and $\mathcal{L}$) that govern the backreaction dynamics. The resulting formalism suggests potentially observable signatures in both the propagation (phase shifts, amplitude modulation) and stochastic background of gravitational waves. These effects could be probed by next-generation detectors, offering new constraints on the $f(R, G)$ coupling parameters. The theoretical framework developed here provides a foundation for future studies of gravitational wave generation in modified gravity scenarios and their role in the formation of cosmological structures.

## 13. Strong-field Gravitational Wave Lensing in the Kerr Background

**Abstract**: Strong-field Gravitational Wave Lensing in the Kerr Background M. V. S. Saketh, Rajes Ghosh, Anuj Mishra v2 (Mismatch analysis updated, references updated), 23 Pages, 10 Figures, 1 Table General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Gravitational-wave (GW) lensing can encode valuable information about the properties of the intervening lens, but most existing studies remain restricted to the small-deflection, weak-field regime. To bridge this crucial gap, this work presents the first systematic analysis of strong-field, wave-optical GW lensing by a Kerr black hole (BH), extending recent results for non-rotating lens to the astrophysically more relevant case of spinning-lens. Using the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi formalism, we compute the strong-field scattering factor and show that the the spin produces characteristic modifications to the lensed waveform, and high-frequency incident radiation is not strongly absorbed by the BH lens, contrary to earlier claims. We further derive explicit expressions for the observed waveform for the general source-lens-observer configuration, showcasing the distortions produced by the scattering and quantifying their departure from the Schwarzschild case. Specializing to on-axis scattering, a mismatch analysis for a GW150914-like source lensed by a Kerr BH of mass $M=10^2~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ situated $100M$ away from the source reveals percent-level deviations from the unscattered wave at scattering angles near $30^\circ$, across a range of lens spin values. The mismatch generally decreases as the scattering angle increases, but this behavior can change substantially when polarization mixing induced by scattering becomes significant. In such cases, components that are absent/suppressed in the direct signal may become appreciable due to scattering effects. For a fixed scattering angle, however, the mismatch shows only a weak dependence on the BH spin in the case of on-axis scattering, which may improve for more general configurations. The framework developed here offers a unified treatment of strong-field GW scattering in Kerr spacetime for interpreting future high-precision GW observations.

## 14. Consistent Regularization of Signature-Changing BTZ Black Holes

**Abstract**: Consistent Regularization of Signature-Changing BTZ Black Holes Farzad Milani 37 pages, 7 figures (4 composite figures with subpanels, total 10 individual EPS files). Includes 2 appendices General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Spacetime singularities represent a fundamental challenge in gravitational physics. We present a mathematically consistent framework for signature-changing black holes based on the $(2+1)$-dimensional BTZ metric, where the signature transitions from Lorentzian $(-,+,+)$ to Euclidean $(+,+,+)$ at the horizon. We identify and rectify a critical inconsistency in previous regularization schemes concerning second-order distributional terms $\varepsilon''(r)$, introducing a \emph{modified Hadamard regularization} that respects distribution theory. This produces a vacuum solution free of surface layers and impulsive gravitational waves. Geodesic analysis reveals that radially infalling observers require infinite proper time to reach the horizon, effectively preventing access to the would-be singularity while maintaining finite curvature invariants throughout the spacetime. We further establish the physical robustness of the geometry by demonstrating linear stability against gravitational perturbations, showing that quantum scalar field propagation remains unitary and well-defined across the signature change, and reinterpreting the $r=0$ region as a topological boundary rather than a curvature singularity. Our work establishes atemporality via signature change as a mathematically rigorous mechanism for \emph{singularity avoidance} in black hole spacetimes.

**Abstract**: Probing quantum anomaly corrections on black hole physics through chaos Yu-Sen An, Wei-Hao Zhang v1: 8 pages, 3 figures. v2: Typos corrected, Reference added General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The black hole horizon can induce chaotic motion of particles around the black hole. The original integrable motion of particles can transit to the chaotic motion when approaching black hole horizon. In this work, we consider the black hole background where quantum conformal anomaly correction is taken into account. We use Poincare section and Lyapunov exponent as representative probes to illustrate chaos. We investigate the effect of anomaly coefficient on the chaos of particles and for both probes, we find that quantum anomaly generally enhances the chaos of particle motions. As the chaotic orbits of particles can leave an imprint on the gravitational wave signals of the extreme mass ratio inspirals, our results pave the way to detect conformal anomaly effect in actual observations.

**Abstract**: Impact of general relativistic accretion on primordial black holes Santabrata Das, Md Riajul Haque, Jitumani Kalita, Rajesh Karmakar, Debaprasad Maity 9 pages, 6 figures, published in Physical Review D Phys. Rev. D 112, 123540 (2025) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We demonstrate that general relativistic corrections to the accretion of relativistic matter onto primordial black holes (PBHs) can significantly enhance their mass growth during the early Universe. Contrary to previous Newtonian treatments, our analysis reveals that PBH masses can increase by an order of magnitude before evaporation, leading to substantial modifications of their lifetime and cosmological imprints. We quantify the resulting shifts in the minimum PBH mass constrained by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), the revised lower bound for PBHs surviving today, and the dark matter parameter space allowed by PBH evaporation. Furthermore, we show that the enhanced accretion alters the high-frequency gravitational wave spectrum from PBH evaporation, potentially within the reach of future detectors. Our results provide a comprehensive, relativistically consistent framework to delineate the role of PBHs in early-universe cosmology and dark matter phenomenology.

## 17. Extended mass distribution of PBHs during QCD phase transition: SGWB and mini-EMRIs

Rev. D) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Primordial black holes (PBHs) are one of the most important tracers of cosmic history. In this work, we investigate the formation of PBHs around the time of the QCD phase transition from a broadly peaked inflationary scalar power spectrum, which naturally produces an extended PBH mass function. This scenario yields two distinct stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB): (i) scalar-induced, second-order tensor perturbations generated at PBH formation, and (ii) a merger-driven SGWB from the subsequent PBH binary population. Using Bayesian analysis, we examine both SGWB channels with the data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the first three observing runs of LVK. We also forecast continuous-wave signals from mini extreme mass ratio inspirals (mini-EMRIs) for direct comparison with NANOGrav and LVK constraints. Our parameter scans identify regions of the parameter space where the combined SGWB is detectable in future ground-based and space-based detectors. A broad PBH mass distribution naturally gives rise to mini-EMRIs, which future ground-based observatories, such as LVK A+, ET, and CE, can detect. For a large part of the PBH parameter space, the SGWB of astrophysical origin masks the primordial SGWB in the frequency band of ground-based detectors. Thus, for extended PBH mass distributions, we find that the detection of mini-EMRIs is a more robust channel for probing the PBH parameter space than the corresponding SGWB.

Edwards Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det) The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) data stream will inevitably contain gaps due to maintenance and environmental disturbances, introducing nonstationarities and spectral leakage that compromise standard frequency-domain likelihood evaluations. We present a scalable Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) framework capable of robust parameter estimation directly from gapped time-series data. We employ Flow Matching Posterior Estimation (FMPE) conditioned on a learned summary of the data, optimized through an end-to-end training strategy. To address the computational challenges of long-duration signals, we propose a dual-pathway summarizer architecture: a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) operating on the time domain for high precision, and a novel wavelet-based 2D CNN utilizing asymmetric, dilated kernels to achieve scalability for datasets spanning months. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework on simulated Galactic Binary-like signals, showing that our joint training approach yields tighter, unbiased posteriors compared to two-stage reconstruction pipelines. Furthermore, we provide the first systematic comparison showing that FMPE offers superior stability and coverage calibration over conventional Normalizing Flows in the presence of severe data artifacts.

**Abstract**: A Generative Reconstruction of Low-$\ell$ CMB B-Mode Signal using Reverse Diffusion in Deep Learning Anumanchi Agastya Sai Ram Likhit, Rajib Saha Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Detecting primordial B-mode polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) provides a direct probe of inflationary gravitational waves. However, the signal is extremely faint and contaminated by gravitational lensing, instrumental noise, and astrophysical foregrounds. Here we present a score-based diffusion approach, formulated using variance-exploding stochastic differential equations (VE-SDEs), to reconstruct the primordial B-mode angular power spectrum from contaminated observations. The method employs a reverse SDE guided by a score model trained exclusively on random realizations of the primordial low $\ell$ B-mode angular power spectrum corresponding to a fixed tensor-to-scalar ratio $r=0.001$. During inference, the reverse SDE iteratively drives the observed angular power spectrum toward the learned primordial manifold, effectively denoising and delensing the input. The model is tested on simulated observational spectra that include gravitational lensing, complex polarized foreground combinations, and instrumental noise characteristics representative of the proposed ECHO mission. The trained score model learns the underlying statistical distribution of the primordial B-mode field for the given $r$, which acts as a physics-guided prior that can generate new, consistent realizations of the signal. This approach provides a robust framework for primordial signal recovery in future CMB polarization missions.

**Abstract**: Gravitational waves from seesaw assisted collapsing domain walls Debasish Borah, Indrajit Saha High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries like $Z_2$ leads to the formation of stable topological defects such as domain walls which, if allowed to dominate, can potentially be in conflict with cosmological observations. Incorporating explicit $Z_2$-breaking bias terms can lead to annihilation of such walls while also emitting stochastic gravitational wave (GW). We study the role of heavy right-handed neutrinos present in type-I seesaw origin of light neutrino masses to generate such bias term via quantum corrections. This offers interesting correlation among the seesaw scale, GW peak amplitude and peak frequency which can be probed at present and future experiments related to GW as well as precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In flavor symmetric UV complete scenarios with degenerate RHNs at leading order, such tiny coupling of RHNs to a $Z_2$-odd scalar can also lead to small mass splittings suitable for explaining the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via resonant leptogenesis.

**Abstract**: Nonminimal infrared gravitational reheating in light of ACT observation Ayan Chakraborty, Debaprasad Maity, Rajesh Mondal 32 pages + appendices, 9 figures, 1 table Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Inflation is known to produce large infrared scalar fluctuations. Further, if a scalar field $(\chi)$ is non-minimally coupled with gravity through $\xi \chi^2 R$, those infrared modes experience \textit{tachyonic instability} during and after inflation. Those large non-perturbative infrared modes can collectively produce hot Big Bang universe upon their horizon entry during the post-inflationary period. We indeed find that for reheating equation of state (EoS), $w_{\phi} > 1/3$, and coupling strength, $\xi>1/6$, large infrared fluctuations lead to successful reheating. We further analyze perturbative reheating by solving the standard Boltzmann equation in both Jordan and Einstein frames, and compare the results with the non-perturbative ones. Finally, embedding this infrared reheating scenario into the well-known $\alpha-$attractor inflationary model, we examine possible constraints on the model parameters in light of the latest ACT, DESI results. To arrive at the constraints, we take into account the latest bounds on tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r_{0.05}\leq 0.038$, isocurvature power spectrum, $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{S}} \lesssim 8.3\times 10^{-11}$, and effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \lesssim 0.17 $. Subject to these constraints, we find successful reheating to occur only for EoS $w_{\phi}\gtrsim 0.6$, which translates to a sub-class of $\alpha-$attractor models being favored and placing them within the 2$\sigma$ region in the $ n_s-r$ plane of the latest ACT, DESI data. In this range of EoS, we find that the coupling strength should lie within $2.11\lesssim\xi\lesssim 2.95$ for $w_{\phi}=0.6$. Finally, we compute secondary gravitational wave signals induced by the scalar infrared modes, which are found to be strong enough to be detected by future GW observatories, namely BBO, DECIGO, LISA, and ET.

## 22. Limits on dark matter existence in neutron stars from recent astrophysical observations and mass correlation analysis

**Abstract**: Limits on dark matter existence in neutron stars from recent astrophysical observations and mass correlation analysis Jing Fu Hu, Hang Lu, Bao Yuan Sun High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th) Dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANSs) serve as a specific astrophysical laboratory for probing the features of dark matter (DM) and have emerged as a promising candidate for interpreting recent astrophysical observations (e.g., by NICER and LIGO/Virgo). Accurately constraining the internal DM content of DANSs is therefore of critical importance. In this work, we construct the equations of state (EoS) for DANS matter by employing twelve nuclear matter (NM) models within the covariant density functional (CDF) theory and a self-interacting fermionic model for DM. Using these EoSs as input, we solve the two-fluid Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equations to systematically investigate the influence of DM on the global properties of neutron stars (NSs). By incorporating recent observational constraints on NS properties, the maximum DM mass fraction $f_\chi^{\mathrm{max}}$ in DANSs is determined for each NM EoS model. Our analysis reveals a strong linear correlation (Pearson coefficient $r=0.98$) between $f_\chi^{\mathrm{max}}$ and the maximum mass of a pure NS, $M_{\rm{NS}}^{\mathrm{max}}$, described by $f_{\chi}^{\mathrm{max}} = 0.22 M_{\mathrm{NS}}^{\mathrm{max}} - 0.44$. Leveraging this correlation and the observed NS maximum mass distribution, $P(M_{\text{NS}}^{\max} \mid \text{EM})$, we derive the probability distribution function (PDF) for the maximum DM mass, $P(M_{\chi}^{\max} \mid \text{EM})$, in DANSs. We find that at the 68\% confidence level, $M_{\chi}^{\mathrm{max}}=0.150^{+0.070}_{-0.051}\ M_{\odot}$. This quantitative constraint on the DM mass provides a critical prior for interpreting potential observational signatures of DANSs, such as anomalous tidal deformabilities and distinctive gravitational-wave signals.

## 23. Optically thick winds of very massive stars suppress intermediate-mass black hole formation

**Abstract**: Optically thick winds of very massive stars suppress intermediate-mass black hole formation Stefano Torniamenti, Michela Mapelli, Lumen Boco, Filippo Simonato, Giuliano Iorio, Erika Korb 10 pages, 7 figures. Comments welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are the link between stellar-mass and supermassive black holes. Gravitational waves have started unveiling a population of IMBHs in the $\sim 100-300 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ range. Here, we investigate the formation of IMBHs from non-rotating very massive stars (VMSs, $>100\,{} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$). We calculate new VMS models that account for the transition from optically thin to optically thick winds, and study how this enhanced mass loss affects IMBH formation and the black hole mass function at intermediate and high metallicity ($Z=10^{-4}-0.02$). We show that optically thick winds suppress the formation of IMBHs from direct VMS collapse at metallicities $Z>0.001$, one order of magnitude lower than predicted by previous models. Our models indicate that the stellar progenitors of GW231123 must have had a metallicity $Z<0.002$, if the primary black hole formed via direct VMS collapse.
