## 1. Constraining the Cosmological Evolution of Post-Newtonian Parameters with Gravitational Wave Signals from Compact Binary Inspirals

**Abstract**: Constraining the Cosmological Evolution of Post-Newtonian Parameters with Gravitational Wave Signals from Compact Binary Inspirals Oliver Pitt, Timothy Clifton General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Gravitational waves from compact binary inspirals offer a new opportunity to constrain the cosmological time dependence of gravitational coupling parameters, due to the high precision of the observations themselves as well as the significant cosmological redshifts at which such systems exist. We calculate theory-independent equations of motion for compact objects in a binary system, implementing a new approach to sensitivities, and subsequently determine the gravitational wave signal that one should expect to measure from their inspiral. Expressions for the wave phase and amplitude are derived in terms of post-Newtonian gravitational coupling parameters, radiative flux parameters, and compact body sensitivities. These results complement recent attempts to gain theory-independent constraints on the time-evolution of gravitational coupling parameters from cosmological probes, and represent a new opportunity to constrain modified gravity with gravitational wave data.

**Abstract**: Distinguishing between Black Holes and Neutron Stars within a Population of Weak Tidal Measurements Michael M√ºller, Reed Essick General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We study the ability of tidal signatures within the inspiral of compact binaries observed through gravitational waves (GWs) to distinguish between neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs). After quantifying how hard this measurement is on a single-event basis, we investigate the ability of a large catalog of GW detections to constrain the fraction of NS in the population as a function of mass: $f_{\mathrm{NS}}(m)$. Using simulated catalogs with realistic measurement uncertainty, we find that $> O(200)$ events will be needed before we can precisely measure $f_{\mathrm{NS}}$, and catalogs of $> O(100)$ events will be needed before we can even rule out the possibility that all low-mass objects are BHs with GW data alone (i.e., without electromagnetic counterparts). Therefore, this is unlikely to occur with advanced detectors, even at design sensitivity. Nevertheless, it could be feasible with next-generation facilities like Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope.

**Abstract**: Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves: universal characteristics of strongly lensed memory waveforms Ruanjing Zhang, Zhi-Chao Zhao, Shaoqi Hou, Xi-Long Fan, Kai Liao, Zong-Hong Zhu 18 pages, 6 figures. comments are welcome General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this work, the strong lensing effect of the memory signal was considered. In the geometric optics limit, the lensed memory signal becomes oscillatory, while the unlensed is basically monotonic. This is because only the high frequency Fourier modes contribute to the lensed signal. Therefore, the strong lensing system serves as a high-pass filter for the memory signal. Due to the step function like behavior of the unlensed memory waveform, the lensed waveform possesses characteristic morphology that is dependent on the type of the image, and independent of the lens model and the binary system. That is, for each type of the lensed image, the lensed memory waveform has an approxmiate reflection symmetry about a symmetrical axis in the time domain. More specifically, for the type I and type III images, the lensed memory signals are nearly odd under the reflection, while the type II signal is roughly even. In addition, at the symmetrical axis, the sign of the slope for type I image is different from that for the type III image. These universal characteristic features would help determine the type of the lensed image. This is particularly because the memory waveform can be well approximated by a suitable step function, which involves two parameters. In addition, the detection of multiple images by the space-borne interferometer would also be helpful. Once the type of the lensed image is determined with the approximated memory waveform, one can use the appropriate waveform template for the oscillatory component of the gravitational wave to perform the parameter estimation.

In this study, we analyze continuous GWs from the SMBHB candidate 3C 66B, modeling the GWB as a common uncorrelated red noise. Using Bayesian methods, we perform targeted searches across two PTA data sets: Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves 15 years data set and the European Pulsar Timing Array DR2 full data set. We find no evidence of such signal in both data sets and then place upper limits on the amplitude of the signal and the chirp mass of the source. Additionally, we evaluate the case of a GWB characterized by Hellings-Downs correlations using a likelihood reweighting method, which consistently reconfirms the conclusion of non-detection.

The inflaton condensate is treated as a homogeneous background coupled to a relativistic fluid that represents its inhomogeneous fluctuations. Within the divergence-type theory framework derived from kinetic considerations, the model captures essential dissipative and non-equilibrium effects while remaining stable and causal. We find that the coupling between the oscillating condensate and the fluid induces a parametric resonance in the tensor sector, leading to the amplification of the viscous stress tensor and the generation of gravitational waves with a characteristic spectral peak. The predicted spectrum agrees with lattice simulations performed with CosmoLattice. This hydrodynamic approach offers an effective bridge between microscopic field dynamics and macroscopic cosmological observables.

We provide a detailed derivation of the gravitational wave signal sourced from the anisotropic emission of neutrinos and provide the total (fluid sourced and neutrino sourced) gravitational waves signal generated in our models. We discuss the templatablity of this low-frequency signal, which is useful for future work involving matched filtering for signal detection and parameter estimation.

**Abstract**: Ringdown spectroscopy of phenomenologically modified black holes Spyros Thomopoulos, Sebastian H. V√∂lkel, Harald P. Pfeiffer Phys. Rev. D 112, 064054, (2025) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The characteristic oscillations of black holes, as described by their quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum, play a fundamental role in testing general relativity with gravitational waves. The so-called parametrized QNM framework was introduced to predict perturbative changes in the spectrum due to small deviations from general relativity. In this work, we extend the framework to model time domain signals and study the excitation of quasinormal modes from the time evolution of initial data. Specifically, we quantify whether the perturbative eigenvalue predictions agree with extracting excited quasinormal modes from such simulations. Addressing this issue is particularly important in the context of agnostic ringdown tests and the possible presence of spectral instabilities, which may diminish the promises of black hole spectroscopy. We find that the extracted quasinormal modes agree well with the perturbative predictions, underlining that these types of modifications can, in principle, be robustly tested from real observations. Moreover, we also report the importance of including late-time tails for accurate mode extractions. Finally, we provide a WKB-inspired analysis supporting the importance of the peak of the scattering potential and show robust scaling relations.

The waveforms are generated employing a time-domain Teukolsky code. We span different values of the Kerr spin $-0.99 \le a \le 0.99 $ and of the critical eccentricity $e_c$, for bound ($0 \le e_c<1$) and unbound plunges ($e_c \ge 1$). We find that, contrary to expectations, the waveform modes $h_{\ell m}$ do not always manifest a peak for high eccentricities or spins. In case of the dominant $h_{22}$ mode, we determine the precise region of the parameter space in which its peak exists. In this region, we provide a characterization of the merger quantities of the $h_{22}$ mode and of the higher-order modes, providing the merger structure of the equatorial eccentric plunges of the Kerr spacetime in the test-mass limit.

**Abstract**: A Python Interface for Numerical Relativity Program AMSS-NCKU Chen-Kai Qiao, Yi Zheng, Zhou-Jian Cao 11 pages, 3 figures, 1 appendix General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Numerical relativity has produced profound and extensive impacts on modern astrophysics and gravitational-wave astronomy. In this work, we develop a Python interface for the numerical relativity program AMSS-NCKU. This interface enables the automation of initializing and executing the AMSS-NCKU simulations, as well as the automated visualization of the output data. To show the practical utility of this Python interface, we present two representative examples of numerical relativity simulations (the binary and triple black hole merger processes), obtaining well-behaved stable numerical results and the expected physical behaviors for black hole systems. The Python operational interface significantly reduces the operational complexity of the AMSS-NCKU simulation workflow, lowering the technical barriers for freshman users.

## 10. Gravitational Waves from Resonant Transitions of Tidally Perturbed Gravitational Atoms

**Abstract**: Gravitational Waves from Resonant Transitions of Tidally Perturbed Gravitational Atoms Antonios Kyriazis, Fengwei Yang Final version, accepted at JHEP High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Light bosons can form a gravitational atom (GA) around a spinning black hole through the superradiance process. Considering the black hole to be part of a binary system, the tidal potential of the companion periodically perturbs the GA such that an ``atomic'' transition occurs between two of its energy eigenstates. The resonant transition is modeled by the Landau-Zener system, where the orbital frequency of the companion determines the relevant transition. In this work, we study a novel quasi-monochromatic gravitational wave signal originating directly from the level transition of the GA in a binary system. We derive the analytical formulae of both the strain waveform and frequency spectrum of the signal. We further investigate the GA-binary systems that can have a large signal-to-noise ratio in the milli-Hz to deci-Hz frequency band. Using the future space-based gravitational wave observatory DECIGO, we find the signal-to-noise ratio is $\mathcal{O}(10-200)$ for the fine-structure constant $\alpha\simeq 0.3$, host black hole mass $M= 150M_\odot$ and boson mass $\mu \simeq 10^{-13} \rm eV$ at a distance within 100 kpc. Given astrophysical uncertainties about the black hole's initial spin, the degeneracy with other monochromatic signals and the small merger rate at those distances, we conclude that the detection of the signal would be challenging.

**Abstract**: GW-YOLO: Multi-transient segmentation in LIGO using computer vision Siddharth Soni, Nikhil Mukund, Erik Katsavounidis Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Time series data and their time-frequency representation from gravitational-wave interferometers present multiple opportunities for the use of artificial intelligence methods associated with signal and image processing. Closely connected with this is the real-time aspect associated with gravitational-wave interferometers and the astrophysical observations they perform; the discovery potential of these instruments can be significantly enhanced when data processing can be achieved in O(1s) timescales. In this work, we introduce a novel signal and noise identification tool based on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework. For its application into gravitational waves, we will refer to it as GW-YOLO. This tool can provide scene identification capabilities and essential information regarding whether an observed transient is any combination of noise and signal. Additionally, it supplies detailed time-frequency coordinates of the detected objects in the form of pixel masks, an essential property that can be used to understand and characterize astrophysical sources, as well as instrumental noise. The simultaneous identification of noise and signal, combined with precise pixel-level localization, represents a significant advancement in gravitational-wave data analysis. Our approach yields a 50\% detection efficiency for binary black hole signals at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 15 when such signals overlap with transient noise artifacts. When noise artifacts overlap with binary neutron star signals, our algorithm attains 50\% detection efficiency at an SNR of 30. This presents the first quantitative assessment of the ability to detect astrophysical events overlapping with realistic, instrument noise present in gravitational-wave interferometers.

## 12. Inferring cosmological parameters from galaxy and dark sirens cross-correlation

**Abstract**: Inferring cosmological parameters from galaxy and dark sirens cross-correlation Giona Sala, Alessandro Cuoco, Julien Lesgourgues, Kostantinos-Rafail Revis, Lorenzo Valbusa Dall'Armi, Santiago Casas 31 pages, 12 figures, comments welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The number of observed gravitational wave (GW) events is growing fast thanks to rapidly improving detector sensitivities. GWs from compact binary coalescences like Black Holes or Neutron Stars behave like standard sirens and can be used as cosmological probes. To this aim, generally, the observation of an electromagnetic counterpart and the measurement of the redshift are needed. However, even when those are not available, it is still possible to exploit these "dark sirens" via statistical methods. In this work, we explore a method that exploits the information contained in the cross-correlation of samples of GW events with matter over-density tracers like galaxy catalogues. Contrary to other currently employed dark-sirens methods, this approach does not suffer from systematic errors related to the incompleteness of the galaxy catalogue. To further enhance the technique, we implement tomography in redshift space for the galaxy catalogue and luminosity distance space for the GWs. We simulate future data collected by the array of currently existing detectors, namely LIGO, Virgo, and Kagra, as well as planned third-generation ones such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorers. We cross-correlate these data with those from upcoming photometric galaxy surveys such as Euclid. We perform a sensitivity forecast employing a full-likelihood approach and explore the parameter space with Monte Carlo Markov Chains. We find that with this method, third-generation detectors will be able to determine the Hubble constant $H_0$ with an error of only 0.7%, which is enough to provide decisive information to shed light on the Hubble tension. Furthermore, for the other cosmological parameters, we find that the GWs and galaxy surveys information are highly complementary, and the use of both significantly improves the ability to constrain the underlying cosmology.

## 13. Gauge Dependence of Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves from Isocurvature Perturbations: Analytical Results

**Abstract**: Gauge Dependence of Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves from Isocurvature Perturbations: Analytical Results Arshad Ali, Yang Lei, Mudassar Sabir General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We analytically study the gauge dependence of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) sourced by primordial isocurvature perturbations during radiation domination (RD), working across nine gauges. Through analytical integrations of the kernels supported by graphical comparison we identify a clear dichotomy. We find that in some gauges viz. the uniform-density (UD), total-matter (TM), uniform-curvature (UC), comoving-orthogonal (CO) and transverse-traceless (TT) gauges the energy density grows polynomially in conformal time $\eta^n$, where $n$ varies from $2$ to $8$. While in rest of the gauges viz. the longitudinal (Long.), uniform-expansion (UE), Newtonian-motion (Nm), and N-body (Nb) gauges the late-time energy spectrum converges, and SIGWs behave as radiation. For subhorizon modes ($ k\eta \gg 1 $), the divergence becomes severe, showing that SIGWs are gauge-dependent observables in this regime. We resolve it through a kernel projection that isolates the luminal, freely propagating gravitational wave components (oscillating as $\sin(k\eta)$ and $\cos(k\eta)$), eliminating spurious contributions. The resulting kernel decays as $ (k\eta)^{-1} $ and yields a finite, gauge-independent late-time spectrum, confirming that only luminal modes represent physical SIGWs.

**Abstract**: Primordial Black Holes Place the Universe in Stasis Keith R. Dienes, Lucien Heurtier, Fei Huang, Doojin Kim, Tim M.P. Tait, Brooks Thomas 26 pages, LaTeX, 7 figures. Revised to match published version Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) A variety of scenarios for early-universe cosmology give rise to a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) with a broad spectrum of masses. The evaporation of PBHs in such scenarios has the potential to place the universe into an extended period of "stasis" during which the abundances of matter and radiation remain absolutely constant despite cosmological expansion. This surprising phenomenon can give rise to new possibilities for early-universe dynamics and lead to distinctive signatures of the evaporation of such PBHs. In this paper, we discuss how this stasis epoch arises and explore a number of its phenomenological consequences, including implications for inflationary observables, the stochastic gravitational-wave background, baryogenesis, and the production of dark matter and dark radiation.

**Abstract**: Multi-messenger Analysis of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries: The Joint-likelihood Approach Maria Charisi, Stephen Taylor, Jessie Runnoe, Caitlin Witt, Polina Petrov Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) formed in galaxy mergers are promising multi-messenger sources. They can be identified as quasars with periodic variability in electromagnetic (EM) time-domain surveys. The most massive of those systems can be detected by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) in the nanohertz frequency gravitational-wave (GW) band. We present a method to simultaneously analyze EM lightcurves and PTA observations as a multi-messenger data stream. For this, we employ a joint likelihood analysis, in which the likelihood of the EM data and the PTA likelihood are multiplied. We test this approach by simulating 208 binary signals that can be detected both by the Rubin Observatory in the nominal ten-year survey and by a PTA dataset with a ~30-year baseline, which resembles our expectations for a dataset of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) collaboration in ~2035. We compare our multi-messenger analysis with analyses that take into account the EM and PTA data separately. We find that the joint likelihood approach results in improved parameter estimation with smaller percent errors compared to the distinct analyses that consider only EM or PTA data separately. Among the SMBHB parameters, the binary total mass and the orbital inclination show the greatest improvement. We also compare our multi-messenger pipeline with an analysis, in which the EM constraints are used as priors to the PTA analysis. We demonstrate that the joint likelihood approach delivers tighter constraints on all binary parameters, with systematically higher values of Kullback-Leibler divergence, which measures the deviation of the posterior distribution from the prior.

## 16. Simulation of Binary-Single Interactions in AGN Disks II: Merger Probability of Binary Black Holes during Chaotic Triple Process

**Abstract**: Simulation of Binary-Single Interactions in AGN Disks II: Merger Probability of Binary Black Holes during Chaotic Triple Process Mengye Wang, Qingwen Wu, Yiqiu Ma 15pages, 9 figures, Accepted by ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Stellar-mass binary black hole\,(BBH) mergers resulting from binary-single interactions\,(BSIs) in active galactic nucleus\,(AGN) disks are a potential source of gravitational wave\,(GW) events with measurable eccentricities. Previous hydrodynamical simulations have shown that ambient gas can significantly influence the dynamics of BSIs. However, due to limitations such as the use of purely Newtonian dynamics and small sample sizes, a direct estimation of the BBH merger probability during BSI has remained elusive. In this work, we directly quantify the merger probability, based on a suite of 1800 two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations coupled with post-Newtonian \emph{N}-body calculations. Our results demonstrate that dense gas can enhance the merger probability by both shrinking the spatial scale of the triple system and increasing the number of binary-single encounters. These two effects together boost the merger probability by a factor of $\sim$5, from 4\% to as high as 20\%. Among the two effects, our analysis suggests that the increase in encounter frequency plays a slightly more significant role in driving the enhancement. Moreover, this enhancement becomes more significant at larger radial distances from the central SMBH, since the total gas mass enclosed within the Hill sphere of the triple system increases with radius. Finally, the BSI process in AGN disks can naturally produce double GW merger events within a timescale of $\sim$year, which may serve as potential observational signatures of BSI occurring in AGN disk environments.

**Abstract**: Conditional Autoencoder for Generating Binary Neutron Star Waveforms with Tidal and Precession Effects Mengfei Sun, Jie Wu, Jin Li, Brendan Mccane, Nan Yang, Xianghe Ma, Borui Wang, Minghui Zhang Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers provide critical insights into dense matter physics and strong-field gravity, yet accurate waveform modeling remains computationally intensive. We present a deep generative model for gravitational waveforms from binary neutron star mergers that captures the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown phases while incorporating spin precession and tidal effects. Using a conditional autoencoder architecture, the model efficiently produces high-fidelity waveforms across a broad parameter space, including component masses (m1, m2), spin components (S1x, S1y, S1z, S2x, S2y, S2z), and tidal deformabilities (Lambda1, Lambda2). Trained on 1*10^6 waveforms generated by the IMRPhenomXP_NRTidalv2 model, our network achieves a mean mismatch of 2.13*10^-3. The generation time for a single waveform is 0.12 s, compared to 0.66 s for IMRPhenomXP_NRTidalv2, representing a speedup of about fivefold. When generating 1000 waveforms, the model completes the task in 0.75 s, roughly ten times faster than the baseline. This significant acceleration facilitates rapid parameter estimation and real-time gravitational-wave searches. With improved precision and efficiency, the model can support low-latency detection and broader applications in multi-messenger astrophysics.

We apply a fully-automatic procedure to derive aperture photometry in 10 different bands for the 323 nearby galaxies in the Herschel Reference Sample (HRS), and compare its results with the rigorous analyses involving specialised knowledge and human intervention carried out by the HRS team. Results. Our experiment shows that 9 of the 10 skymaps considered preserve the original quality of the data, and the photometric fluxes returned by our pipeline are consistent with the HRS measurements within a few per cent. In the case of Herschel PACS maps at 100 {\mu}m, we uncovered a systematic error that we ascribe to an inconsistent combination of data products with different spatial resolution. For the remaining skymaps, the estimated statistical uncertainties provide a realistic indication of the differences with respect to the HRS catalogue. Conclusions. In principle, the currently available HiPS skymaps in Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) format allow to carry out broadband photometric analyses with an accuracy of the order of a few percent, but some level human intervention is still required. In addition to assessing data quality, we also propose a series of recommendations to realise the full potential of the HiPS format for the scientific analysis of large astronomical data sets.
