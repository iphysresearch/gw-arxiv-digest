**Abstract**: Characterization of exotic matter in PT-symmetric wormholes Hicham Zejli 50 pages, 4 figures. Accepted for publication in General Relativity and Gravitation (Springer Nature, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10714-025-03497-9). The paper presents a relativistic analysis extending the Barrabes--Israel formalism to null shells in a PT-symmetric geometry. It fits within General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In our previous work [H. Zejli, Int. J. Mod. Phys. D 34, 2550052 (2025), arXiv:2508.00035], we introduced a PT-symmetric wormhole model based on a bimetric geometry, capable of generating closed timelike curves (CTCs). In this paper, we extend the analysis to the null hypersurface at the throat of this modified Einstein-Rosen bridge, where two regular Eddington-Finkelstein metrics render the geometry traversable. Using the Barrabes--Israel formalism in Poisson's reformulation, we evaluate the null shell's surface stress-energy tensor $S^{\alpha\beta}$ from the jump of the transverse curvature, revealing a violation of the null energy condition: a lightlike membrane of exotic matter with negative surface energy density and positive tangential pressure. This exotic fluid acts as a repulsive source stabilizing the throat, ensuring consistency with the Einstein field equations, including conservation laws on the shell. Beyond the local characterization, we outline potential observational signatures: (i) gravitational-wave echoes from the photon-sphere cavity; (ii) horizon-scale imaging with duplicated and through-throat photon rings, and non-Kerr asymmetries; (iii) quantum effects such as PT-induced frequency pairing with possible QNM doublets and partial suppression of vacuum flux at the throat; and (iv) a relic cosmological population yielding an effective $\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and seeding voids. Compared with timelike thin-shell constructions, our approach is based on a null junction interpreted as a lightlike membrane, combined with PT symmetry, providing a distinct route to traversability and clarifying the conditions under which CTCs can arise in a self-consistent framework.

**Abstract**: The Physics of Black Holes and Their Environments: Consequences for Gravitational Wave Science Vitor Cardoso, Shauvik Biswas, Subhodeep Sarkar v1: 110 pages, 31 figures, 1 table, 1 appendix; abstract abridged. Lecture Notes from Beyond the Horizon: Testing the Black Hole Paradigm program held at ICTS-TIFR, Bengaluru, India from 24 March 2025 to 04 April 2025. Mathematica Notebooks are available at the CoG website, see this https URL General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Classical Physics (physics.class-ph) Ten short years ago, we had the rare privilege of witnessing the onset of a renaissance in science: humanity finally succeeded in its arduous quest to directly detect gravitational waves. This breakthrough did not occur in a vacuum: it was the natural culmination of decades of research dedicated towards understanding the nature of gravitation based on Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. It is a story of false starts, perseverance, and remarkable insights, propelled as much by technological progress as by human curiosity. We now proudly live in the new golden age of gravitational physics. The detection of gravitational wave signals from the merger of binary black holes and neutron stars are becoming routine. Coupled with our theoretical understanding of phenomena in the strong gravity regime, black hole physics has become a precision science. The purpose of these lecture notes is to help the reader understand the language and framework of this rapidly evolving subject, and to develop the ability to interpret, think, and discuss ideas that lie at the confluence of gravitational wave astronomy and black hole physics. It is our hope that these notes will prepare students and colleagues for the next revolution when gravitational wave events become commonplace and we begin to observe unexpected features in the signal, indicating either surprising astrophysical scenarios or a strong need to modify the theoretical description of gravitational interactions. We provide first principles analysis of black hole and gravitational wave physics, and sometimes a very personal interpretation of results. We share with the readers a number of notebooks that will allow them to reproduce some of the most important results in the field, and could even help in carrying out state-of-the-art research. We also include a few original results that we think are helpful in understanding the broader picture.

## 3. The effects of dark energy on the matter-gravity coupling

**Abstract**: The effects of dark energy on the matter-gravity coupling Antonio Enea Romano General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Dark energy perturbations are expected to modify the evolution of cosmological perturbations, producing observable effects on scalar perturbations and gravitational waves. We show that the effects of dark energy for a generic modified gravity model can be encoded in a momentum, space and polarization dependent effective matter-gravity coupling, in agreement with the results obtained in some specific theories, and that this is not just related to the effective Planck mass appearing in the action as a coefficient of the Ricci's scalar. Using appropriately defined effective energy tensors, we show that the method can be extended to include also the effects of higher order perturbations. The generality of this effective description of the effects of dark energy on cosmological perturbations gives a solid theoretical justification for the phenomenological approaches often used in the analysis of cosmological observations, allowing to understand the mapping between the results of phenomenological analysis of observational data and theoretical models. The momentum and polarization dependence of the effective gravitational coupling implies that the gravitational energy emitted by a binary coalescence can have an additional frequency and polarization dependence, due to the effects of dark energy perturbations.

**Abstract**: Gravitational waveforms from periodic orbits around a dyonic ModMax black hole Mirzabek Alloqulov, Sanjar Shaymatov, Bobomurat Ahmedov, Tao Zhu 12 pages, 11 captioned figures, 1 captioned table General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this work, we study the gravitational waveforms from the periodic orbits of a massive particle around a dyonic ModMax black hole. We begin with a brief analysis of the spacetime and then examine how its parameters influence the dynamics of a massive neutral particle using the Lagrangian formalism. In particular, we compute the characteristics of marginally bound orbits and innermost stable circular orbits. Our results show that the values of these quantities increase with the black hole charge $Q$ and the screening parameter $\gamma$. We then plot various periodic orbits, characterized by the integers ($z$,$w$,$v$). Finally, we present the gravitational waveforms associated with extreme mass ratio inspirals, consisting of a stellar-mass compact object orbiting a supermassive black hole.

## 5. Detectability of axion-like dark matter for different time-delay interferometry combinations in space-based gravitational wave detectors

**Abstract**: Detectability of axion-like dark matter for different time-delay interferometry combinations in space-based gravitational wave detectors Yong-Yong Liu, Jing-Rui Zhang, Ming-Hui Du, He-Shan Liu, Peng Xu, Yun-Long Zhang General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) In the space-based gravitational wave detections, the axion-like dark matter would alter the polarization state of the laser link between spacecrafts due to the birefringence effect. However, current designs of space-based laser interferometer are insensitive to variations in the polarization angle. Thus, the additional wave plates are employed to enable the response of the axion-induced birefringence effect. We calculate and compare the sensitivities of different space-based detectors, accounting for three time-delay interferometry combinations, including Monitor, Beacon, and Relay. We find that the Monitor and Beacon combinations have better sensitivity in the high-frequency range, and the optimal sensitivity reaches $g_{a\gamma}\sim 10^{-13}\text{GeV}^{-1}$, while the Sagnac combination is superior in the low-frequency range. We also find that ASTROD-GW can cover the detection range of axion-like dark matter mass down to $10^{-20}\text{eV}$.

## 6. A Neural Network Approach to Preferred Event Selection for Low-Latency Gravitational-Wave Alerts

**Abstract**: A Neural Network Approach to Preferred Event Selection for Low-Latency Gravitational-Wave Alerts Pratyusava Baral, Cody Messick, Patrick Brady Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration uses multiple independent search pipelines to detect gravitational waves, often resulting in multiple triggers (g-events) for a single astrophysical source. These triggers are grouped into superevents, raising a critical question for multimessenger astronomy: which g-event provides the most accurate sky localization for electromagnetic follow-up? Currently, the g-event with the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is selected, under the assumption that it should provide the best estimators of the source's parameters, including its location on the sky. Analysis of simulated signals reveals systematic deviations from this expectation. In particular, a false-alarm rate (FAR)-based selector performs slightly better than the SNR-based method, but introduces pipeline biases. We present a neural network-based selector trained on simulated signals to identify the g-event with the minimum searched area -- a metric quantifying localization accuracy. The network uses information (detector SNRs, FAR, and chirp mass) from all of the triggers associated with each astrophysical source and is designed to be pipeline-agnostic. Our results show that the neural network outperforms both traditional selectors, achieving a mean searched area ~2% smaller than the SNR-based selector. Unlike FAR-based selection, the neural network preserves the underlying distribution of pipeline contributions, avoiding systematic biases toward specific pipelines. The network can be trained in approximately one minute on a few thousand events and performs event selection instantaneously, making it suitable for low-latency applications. These results demonstrate that machine learning can enhance multimessenger astronomy capabilities while maintaining fairness across detection pipelines. We recommend implementing this approach for future observing runs.

**Abstract**: Detector Response to Gravitational Wave Polarizations in Gravitational Quantum Field Theory Cong Xu, Hong-Bo Jin, Yue-Liang Wu 16 pages, 5 figures, submitted to PRD General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present an analysis of gravitational wave polarization modes within Gravitational Quantum Field Theory (GQFT), a unified theoretical framework reconciling general relativity and quantum field theory. In the six fundamental polarization: two tensors ($+, \times$), two vectors (x, y), and two scalars (breathing, longitudial) modes of gravitational wave, two tensors and breathing are favored by GQFT. Their distinctive detection signatures in space-based interferometers like LISA and Taiji can be verified. Using first-order orbital dynamics in the Solar System Barycenter frame, we identify three novel observational features: (1) characteristic interference patterns between polarization modes, (2) provide a model-independent response function, and (3) sky-position-dependent optimal detection methods. Our approach provides complete sky coverage through polarization mapping while remaining fully compatible with existing mission designs, notably avoiding the need for challenging direct breathing-mode measurements. The results are presented through comprehensive sky maps, offering both theoretical insights into gravitational wave polarization and practical tools for future detectors. This work establishes a new paradigm for testing fundamental gravity theories through their unique polarization fingerprints

## 8. Measuring spin precession from massive black hole binaries with gravitational waves: insights from time-domain signal morphology

**Abstract**: Measuring spin precession from massive black hole binaries with gravitational waves: insights from time-domain signal morphology Simona J. Miller, Maximiliano Isi, Katerina Chatziioannou, Vijay Varma, Sophie Hourihane 20 pages main text, 5 pages appendix (excluding references), 13 figures Phys. Rev. D 112, 104046 (2025) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Robustly measuring binary black hole spins via gravitational waves is key to understanding these systems' astrophysical origins, but remains challenging -- especially for high-mass systems, whose signals are short and dominated by the merger. Nonetheless, events like GW190521 show that strong spin precession can indeed be gleaned. In this work, we track how spin precession imprints on simulated high-mass binary black hole signals cycle-by-cycle using time-domain inference. We investigate a suite of signals, all with the same spins and (near-unity) mass ratio -- yielding identical spin evolution -- but different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), total masses, and extrinsic angles, all of which affect the observed waveform morphology. We truncate each signal at various times and infer source parameters using only the data before or after each cutoff. The resultant posterior allows us to identify which time segments of each signal inform its spin precession constraints. We find that at a sufficiently high post-peak SNR ($\sim 20$), spin precession can be constrained by the NRSur7dq4 waveform model when just the post-peak data (i.e., ringdown) are visible. Similarly, at a large enough pre-cutoff SNR ($\sim 10$), spin precession can be constrained using only pre-peak data (i.e., inspiral); this occurs for signals with detector-frame total mass $\lesssim 100 M_{\odot}$ at GW190521's full-signal SNR. Finally, we vary the inclination, polarization, and phase angles, finding that their configuration need not be fine-tuned to measure spin precession, even for very high-mass and short signals with two to three observable cycles. We do not find that the same morphological features consistently drive precession constraints: in some signals, precession inference hinges on the relationship between a loud merger and quiet pre-merger cycle, as was the case for GW190521, but this is not generically true.

**Abstract**: Lightweight posterior construction for gravitational-wave catalogs with the Kolmogorov-Arnold network Wenshuai Liu, Yiming Dong, Ziming Wang, Lijing Shao 17 pages, 12 figures; accepted by PRD. Code is publicly available at this https URL General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Applications (stat.AP); Machine Learning (stat.ML) Neural density estimation has seen widespread applications in the gravitational-wave (GW) data analysis, which enables real-time parameter estimation for compact binary coalescences and enhances rapid inference for subsequent analysis such as population inference. In this work, we explore the application of using the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) to construct efficient and interpretable neural density estimators for lightweight posterior construction of GW catalogs. By replacing conventional activation functions with learnable splines, KAN achieves superior interpretability, higher accuracy, and greater parameter efficiency on related scientific tasks. Leveraging this feature, we propose a KAN-based neural density estimator, which ingests megabyte-scale GW posterior samples and compresses them into model weights of tens of kilobytes. Subsequently, analytic expressions requiring only several kilobytes can be further distilled from these neural network weights with minimal accuracy trade-off. In practice, GW posterior samples with fidelity can be regenerated rapidly using the model weights or analytic expressions for subsequent analysis. Our lightweight posterior construction strategy is expected to facilitate user-level data storage and transmission, paving a path for efficient analysis of numerous GW events in the next-generation GW detectors.

**Abstract**: A General Framework for the Spontaneous Scalarization of Regular Black Holes Ernesto Contreras, Mikaela Carrasco-Hidalgo, Pedro Bargueño, Arthur G. Suvorov 10 pages, 6 figures. V2: Resubmitted in response to comments General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We investigate the spontaneous scalarization of generic, static, and spherically symmetric regular black holes supported by nonlinear electrodynamics. Starting from an arbitrary seed metric, we employ the P-dual formalism to reconstruct the electromagnetic sector and subsequently couple a real scalar field nonminimally. As a worked example, we apply the framework to the regular Balart-Vagenas black hole, showing that scalarized and scalar-free branches can coexist in a region where the scalarized configurations are entropically preferred. We further assess possible observational imprints, finding percent-level deviations in both the shadow size and the fundamental scalar quasi-normal modes ($< 10\%$ for small charge-to-mass ratios), indicating that current electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations do not rule out these solutions. Our construction thus provides a general route to explore scalarization on top of nonlinear-electrodynamics-supported spacetimes, extending beyond specific Reissner-Nordström-like cases.

**Abstract**: Generating optimal Gravitational-Wave template banks with metric-preserving autoencoders Giovanni Cabass, Digvijay Wadekar, Matias Zaldarriaga, Zihan Zhou 18 figures, 1 table. v2: Extra figure added and text edited for better clarity General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Matched filtering for signal detection in noisy data requires template banks that capture variation in signal waveforms while minimizing computational cost. Dimensionality reduction of signal waveforms can be important for building efficient template banks. In various domains of physics, dimensionality reduction is very commonly performed using linear methods such as singular value decomposition (SVD). This can, however, introduce redundancies if the signals span curved, nonlinear manifolds in parameter space. Alternatively, autoencoders are a type of neural networks that can be used for non-linear dimensionality reduction. We use a variation of the autoencoder which preserves the metric in its latent space ($g_{ij}^{\text{latent}} \approx g_{ij}^{\text{physical}}$); this enables template banks to be constructed by simply placing a uniform grid in the autoencoder's low-dimensional latent space. We apply our method for creating geometric template banks for gravitational wave searches and show that our banks require fewer dimensions compared to using the SVD basis. Our method can also be useful for other applications requiring dimensionality reduction, such as gravitational waveform modeling, fast parameter estimation and model-independent tests of general relativity. Finally, we discuss extensions to other domains including cosmological parameter estimation, and we show tests of our method in extreme cases of periodic signal manifolds.

## 12. Using tunable coherence for reaching micrometer coherence lengths and suppressing stray light in a power-recycled Michelson interferometer

**Abstract**: Using tunable coherence for reaching micrometer coherence lengths and suppressing stray light in a power-recycled Michelson interferometer Daniel Voigt, Oliver Gerberding Optics (physics.optics); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det) By reentering into laser interferometers, scattered or stray light introduces non-linear noise. This is a major limitation of precision interferometers as preventing such parasitic light is nearly impossible. Thus, substantial effort is put into mitigating the reentering of these fields in various ways. Ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors employ such mitigation techniques to reduce otherwise restrictive stray light noise. However, they are now reaching sensitivities where conventional mitigation techniques reach limitations. Further improvements planed for future observatories are placing even more demanding constraints on tolerable stray light power. We previously presented tunable coherence as a possible technique to ease these constraints and suppress unwanted coherent interference. For these promising demonstrations, the remaining coherence length and achievable suppression in length-constrained layouts was limited, among other things, by the used pseudo-random-noise phase modulation frequency. In this work, we demonstrate stray light suppression and cavity performance at modulation frequencies up to 10 GHz. This reduces the remaining coherence to a few centimeter in an interferometer, and even to the scale of the laser wavelength in a cavity. We further present a first demonstration of tunable coherence in a power-recycled Michelson interferometer, successfully suppressing stray light in a more complex topology.

**Abstract**: Impact of cosmic expansion on gravitational wave spectra from strongly supercooled first-order phase transitions Marek Lewicki, Ville Vaskonen Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We compute the gravitational wave spectra from strongly supercooled first-order phase transitions, explicitly incorporating the evolution of the background metric across the transition from thermal inflation to radiation domination. We find that the spectral shape remains largely unchanged apart from a causality-induced super-horizon tail. However, in contrast to standard expectations, for slow transitions we show that the peak amplitude and frequency exhibit a weaker dependence on the transition rate $\beta$ than the usual scaling of $\propto \beta^{-2}$ and $\propto\beta$, respectively.

The code used by the user is not meant to be public Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We investigate the impact of gravitational-wave (GW) recoil on the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe. Forming 10^9 Solar Mass SMBHs by z=6 is challenging and may require hierarchical mergers of smaller seed black holes. We extend a semi-analytic seed model by explicitly incorporating GW recoil physics. Our model includes: (1) recoil velocity formulae calibrated to numerical relativity for spinning, unequal-mass BH binaries (Campanelli2007,Lousto2012); (2) assignment of spin magnitudes and orientations based on seed type (Population III remnant, stellar cluster, or direct-collapse); and (3) a retention probability scheme comparing the recoil speed to the host halo escape velocity. We find that including GW recoil reduces final SMBH masses by approximately 20-30% by z=6 and creates a population of off-nuclear (``wandering'') BHs amounting to a few percent of the total. Observable consequences include spatial offsets approximately 0.1'' and line-of-sight velocity shifts approximately 10^2-10^3 km\s in a few-percent of high-redshift quasars.

## 15. Bayesian Gaussian Methods for Robust Background Modeling in CALorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET) Gravitational-Wave Searches

**Abstract**: Bayesian Gaussian Methods for Robust Background Modeling in CALorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET) Gravitational-Wave Searches Bisweswar Sen This paper had a critical error about the model and definition of CALET itself. The paper is inaccurate and has scope of infringement. The user published it as an inexperienced undergrad student. The content is immature and not intended for journals High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The search for gamma-ray counterparts to gravitational-wave events with the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) requires accurate and robust background modeling. Previous CALET observing runs (O3 and O4) relied on averaged pre/post-event baselines or low-order polynomial fits, approaches that neglect correlated noise, temporal non-stationarity, and the propagation of background uncertainty into derived flux upper limits. These simplifications can lead to reduced sensitivity to faint or atypical transients. In this work, we present a novel Bayesian framework for background estimation based on Gaussian Process (GP) regression and change-point modeling. Our approach captures correlated structures in the detector background, quantifies predictive uncertainties, and propagates them into both detection statistics and Bayesian credible upper limits. We demonstrate, using archival CALET time-tagged event data and simulated signal injections, that our method improves sensitivity to weak short-duration bursts by up to an order of magnitude compared to traditional polynomial fits. This probabilistic background treatment enables a more physically robust interpretation of non-detections and offers a scalable, real-time compatible extension for future joint multi-messenger searches.

Coughlin, Dakota Dutko, Courey Elliott, Rahul Gupta, Ashish Mahabal, Nikhil Mukund 61 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables. Accepted for publication in ApJS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The General Coordinates Network (GCN) is NASA's time-domain and multi-messenger alert system. GCN distributes two data products - automated ``Notices,'' and human-generated ``Circulars,'' that report the observations of high-energy and multi-messenger astronomical transients. The flexible and non-structured format of GCN Circulars, comprising of more than 40500 Circulars accumulated over three decades, makes it challenging to manually extract observational information, such as redshift or observed wavebands. In this work, we employ large language models (LLMs) to facilitate the automated parsing of transient reports. We develop a neural topic modeling pipeline with open-source tools for the automatic clustering and summarization of astrophysical topics in the Circulars database. Using neural topic modeling and contrastive fine-tuning, we classify Circulars based on their observation wavebands and messengers. Additionally, we separate gravitational wave (GW) event clusters and their electromagnetic (EM) counterparts from the Circulars database. Finally, using the open-source Mistral model, we implement a system to automatically extract gamma-ray burst (GRB) redshift information from the Circulars archive, without the need for any training. Evaluation against the manually curated Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory GRB table shows that our simple system, with the help of prompt-tuning, output parsing, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG), can achieve an accuracy of 97.2 % for redshift-containing Circulars. Our neural search enhanced RAG pipeline accurately retrieved 96.8 % of redshift circulars from the manually curated database. Our study demonstrates the potential of LLMs, to automate and enhance astronomical text mining, and provides a foundation work for future advances in transient alert analysis.

**Abstract**: Gravitational Wave Phase shifts of black hole mergers in AGN Disks Hiromichi Tagawa, Connar Rowan, János Takátsy, Lorenz Zwick, Kai Hendriks, Wen-Biao Han, Johan Samsing High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors have discovered about 200 compact object mergers. The astrophysical origins of these events are highly debated, and it is possible that at least a fraction of them originate from dynamical environments. Among these, the disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are particularly interesting as promising environments, as some observed properties may be more readily produced there. When compact objects merge in these environments, acceleration from the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) or nearby companions is inevitable. Such acceleration induces a phase shift in the observed GW waveforms, which can serve as a useful tool to distinguish the underlying merging environments for each GW event. In this paper, we investigate the expected distribution of such acceleration-induced GW phase shifts, using a semi-analytical model combined with a one-dimensional AGN population synthesis code. We find significant contributions from three-body interactions involving a nearby third object. Our results indicate that the GW phase shift is likely to be larger compared to other channels, making it distinguishable by future GW facilities such as TianQin, DECIGO, Taiji, Einstein Telescope, and Cosmic Explorer. Interestingly, a notable fraction of mergers in fact exhibit a significant GW phase shift ($\gtrsim~{\rm 1\ rad}$) at frequencies above $10~{\rm Hz}$, which could even be detectable by current GW detectors such as LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. Additionally, if gas-hardening during three-body interactions is taken into account, the GW frequency can be boosted to $\gtrsim 10~{\rm Hz}$, potentially further aiding in the detection of the phase shift.

**Abstract**: Isolated Binary Black Hole Formation and Merger Rates from Galaxy Evolution Tyler B. Smith, Manoj Kaplinghat Accepted to ApJ. 26 pages, 12 figures High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration has detected over 150 confirmed gravitational wave events through O4a. Binary black hole (BBH) systems represent the overwhelming majority of these observations. We construct a model for the population of the BBHs based on the distribution of metallicities in galaxies and state-of-the-art stellar evolution models implemented through the Stellar EVolution N-body (SEVN) code. We calculate the redshift evolution of the total merger rate of BBHs and the differential rates with respect to primary mass, secondary mass, and the mass ratio. We explore variations in the delay-time distribution's (DTD) power-law index and show that it affects the total merger rate's spectral shape, but primarily acts as an amplitude shift on the differential rates. When comparing to the primary mass distribution, our results indicate that either the average IMF in dwarf galaxies must be top heavy, or most of the 30-40 $\rm M_\odot$ black holes must be formed through a dynamical capture mechanism. For masses greater than about $50 \, \rm M_\odot$, the predicted number of BBH systems plummet to zero, revealing the well-known mass gap due to the pair instability mechanism and mass loss in binary systems.
