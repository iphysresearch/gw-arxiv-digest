## 1. Nonsingular Rotating Black Holes in the Dark-Energy Dominated Universe

**Abstract**: Nonsingular Rotating Black Holes in the Dark-Energy Dominated Universe Ramon Torres General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Motivated by quantum-gravity scenarios that replace the classical black hole singularity with a regular core, and by the possibility that the dark-energy sector may be scale dependent, we construct a broad class of nonsingular rotating black-hole spacetimes embedded in an improved de Sitter--like background with either constant or running $\Lambda$. Because the Newman--Janis algorithm is generically incompatible with a cosmological-constant fluid, we instead propose a generalized Kerr--Schild construction on a (possibly scale-dependent $\Lambda$) de Sitter seed, yielding a Carter-type metric characterized by a mass function and a $\Lambda$ function. Our construction provides a direct map from static, spherically symmetric regular models to their rotating counterparts. We derive sharp regularity conditions at the ring and we identify a minimal-order subclass. We analyze chronology and show that, for non-negative mass function and $\Lambda$ above a certain negative limit, the spacetimes are stably causal. For minimal-order geometries with non-negative mass, we prove that the weak energy condition must be violated. Finally, we illustrate the framework with an asymptotic-safety--inspired model and discuss horizon structure, surface gravities, and conformal diagrams. These results provide a controlled, observationally oriented arena to confront regular rotating black holes in dark-energy backgrounds with the rapidly improving gravitational-wave and horizon-scale imaging data.

**Abstract**: The Hamiltonian for an atom interacting with gravitational waves Linda M. van Manen, André Grossardt General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph) Building on the relativistic Hamiltonian of Sonnleitner and Barnett arXiv:1806.00234 and its post-Newtonian extensions by Schwartz and Giuilini arXiv:1908.06929, we investigate composite atomic systems in dynamical gravitational backgrounds. Using a local inertial frame and a perturbed Minkowski metric, we derive curvature-dependent corrections to both center-of-mass and internal Hamiltonians for atoms interacting with weak gravitational waves. The resulting Hamiltonian contains distinct curvature couplings modifying the internal potential and affecting the center-of-mass dynamics. These contributions imply that internal-energy variations do not always reduce to mass renormalization and can induce genuine forces due to changes in momentum. The initial research was motivated by anomalous friction-like forces emerging in quantum optics, and clarified that the anomalous forces are mere relativistic corrections from mass-energy equivalence. Our results suggest that, with increasingly sensitive detectors, additional forces from gravitational wave interactions may become visible in future experiments.

## 3. Assessing astrophysical foreground subtraction in DECIGO using compact binary populations inferred from the first part of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's fourth observation run

**Abstract**: Assessing astrophysical foreground subtraction in DECIGO using compact binary populations inferred from the first part of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's fourth observation run Takahiro S. Yamamoto 8 pages, 6 figures, code is available on GitHub at this https URL General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Detecting the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from our Universe under the inflationary era is one of the primary scientific objectives of DECIGO, a space-borne gravitational wave detector sensitive in the 0.1 Hz frequency band. This frequency band is dominated by the gravitational waves from inspiraling compact object binaries. Subtracting these signals is necessary to search for the primordial SGWB. In this paper, we assess the feasibility of the subtraction of such binary signals by employing the population model inferred from the latest gravitational wave event catalogue of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. We find that the projection scheme, which was originally proposed by Cutler & Harms (2005), is necessary to reduce the binary signals to the level where DECIGO can detect the primordial background.

**Abstract**: Towards gravitational wave parameter inference for binaries with an eccentric companion Kai Hendriks, Lorenz Zwick, Pankaj Saini, János Takátsy, Johan Samsing High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We introduce a complete model for dephasing due to line-of-sight acceleration (LOSA) in gravitational wave (GW) signals from stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) in three-body systems. Our prescription provides curvature- and projection-dependent phase features that are not recovered by local-expansion-based treatments. We perform parameter-space surveys and mock parameter inferences assuming the nominal sensitivity of the Einstein Telescope (ET) to identify the regime where the time-varying LOSA allows for separate constraints on the outer orbital parameters, in particular the tertiary mass and distance. We estimate that ET may detect a few to tens of such systems per year, provided that all binaries merge dynamically, and demonstrate that these constraints can be used to directly discriminate between a dynamical and AGN origin for BBHs. Finally, we reanalyse the GW190814 event and four O4a events finding no evidence for LOSA, with the previously claimed LOSA in GW190814 disappearing when a sufficiently long data segment is used.

## 5. Gravitational wave detectors from an experimental perspective

**Abstract**: Gravitational wave detectors from an experimental perspective Marina Trad-Nery, Margherita Turconi, Walid Chaibi Optics (physics.optics); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) This chapter introduces the fundamental principles of gravitational wave detectors in a simple and comprehensive manner. Because these instruments aim for extremely high sensitivity, it is essential to understand their various noise sources, how such noise couples to the detector output, and the strategies used to mitigate them. These noises contributions are computed in the frame of the Virgo detector and a sensitivity curve is calculated. Although a simplified layout of a gravitational wave detector is considered, it takes into account the most dominant effects and yields in a sensitivity estimate close to the what is observed in real detectors.

## 6. Eccentricity evolution of spinning binaries and its dependence on the equation of state of the components

**Abstract**: Eccentricity evolution of spinning binaries and its dependence on the equation of state of the components Sayak Datta General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We study the evolution of the eccentricity of an eccentric orbit with spinning components. We develop a prescription to express the evolving eccentricity in terms of reference eccentricity and frequency. For that purpose we considered the spins to be perpendicular to the orbital plane. Using this we found an analytical result for the contribution of spin in eccentricity evolution. As a result, we expressed orbital eccentricity in a series of reference eccentricity and gravitational wave frequency. The prescription developed here can easily be used to find arbitrarily higher-order contributions of reference eccentricity. With this we computed the eccentricity upto $\mathcal{O}(e_0^5)$. This result can be used to construct the waveforms of spinning compact objects in an eccentric orbit. Since, our expression depends on the spin induced quadrupole moments, we also study the impact of component properties on the eccentricity evolution through the quadrupole moment. We find for BNSs the evolution depends on the equation of state very mildly unless the NSs are subsolar mass. For subsolar mass NSs the deviations from BH case is comparatively larger and has equation of state dependence. For binary boson stars the deviations are comparatively larger across the mass values. We argue that it may affect our understanding of formation channels and their corresponding populations. We also argue that this can possibly be used as another tool to constrain exoticness of compact objects in a binary.

**Abstract**: Improving the Detection of Gravitational-Wave Signals in Real Time Arthur Tolley General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) This thesis presents advancements in the detection of gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences, utilising the most sensitive observatories constructed to date. The research focuses on enhancing gravitational-wave signal searches through the development of new tools and the application of existing methodologies to increase the sensitivity of live gravitational-wave searches. We introduced a novel noise artefact model, which enabled the identification and removal of glitches, thereby facilitating the recovery of previously missed gravitational-wave injections. This pioneering approach established a glitch search pipeline that adapted techniques typically used in gravitational-wave searches to address the unique characteristics of glitches. Additionally, we implemented an exponential noise model within the PyCBC Live search framework, significantly improving the detection ranking statistics for gravitational-wave signals and demonstrating the potential for substantial increases in detection sensitivity. Furthermore, we analysed and proposed enhancements for the PyCBC Live Early Warning search to maximise the detection of gravitational-wave events in the early warning regime. Our findings highlighted deficiencies in the current ranking statistic and led to recommendations for optimising coincidence timing windows and refining phase-time-amplitude histograms. These adjustments aim to increase the detection of gravitational-wave signals, particularly binary neutron star events, in early warning scenarios. The results underscore the importance of advancing search techniques in gravitational-wave astronomy, which can operate independently of detector improvements. By refining search methodologies, we enhance the capacity to detect a greater number of events, contributing significantly to our understanding of the Universe.

**Abstract**: Bayesian Framework to Follow-up Continuous Gravitational Wave Candidates from Deep Surveys Jasper Martins, Maria Alessandra Papa, Benjamin Steltner, Reinhard Prix, P. B. Covas - 19 Pages, 11 Figures - Replaced with journal version Phys. Rev. D 113, 023041 (2026) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Broad all-sky searches for continuous gravitational waves have high computational costs and require hierarchical pipelines. The sensitivity of these approaches is set by the initial search and by the number of candidates from that stage that can be followed up. The current follow-up schemes for the deepest surveys require careful tuning and set-up, have a significant human-labor cost and this impacts the number of follow-ups that can be afforded. Here we present and demonstrate a new follow-up framework based on Bayesian parameter estimation for the rapid, highly automated follow-up of candidates produced by the early stages of deep, wide-parameter space searches for continuous waves.

## 9. The Missing Massive Sector: Massive Boson Stars -- Stability and GW Emission in Head-on Mergers

**Abstract**: The Missing Massive Sector: Massive Boson Stars -- Stability and GW Emission in Head-on Mergers Bo-Xuan Ge General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We investigate quartically self-interacting massive boson stars by constructing equilibrium sequences and performing dynamical evolutions. The mass curve $M(|\phi_c|)$ along these sequences develops multiple extrema, yet stability changes only at the first maximum; configurations beyond it become highly compact and collapse under numerically induced perturbations, with near-critical models displaying a short-lived double-dive behaviour. Head-on collisions of equal-mass stars yield three distinct outcomes - boson star remnants, black hole formation at contact, and collapse of each star to a black hole prior to contact. The associated gravitational-wave energies reflect the competition between increasing compactness and decreasing tidal deformability, and at large self-interaction strengths the collapse-before-contact branch exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic structure. The simulations reported here constitute a substantial catalogue of initial conditions and waveforms, providing a natural basis for neural-network techniques aimed at improving boson star initial data and constructing surrogate models capable of rapidly predicting gravitational-wave signals across an extended parameter space.

## 10. Misinterpreting Spin Precession as Orbital Eccentricity in Gravitational-Wave Signals

**Abstract**: Misinterpreting Spin Precession as Orbital Eccentricity in Gravitational-Wave Signals Snehal Tibrewal, Aaron Zimmerman, Jacob Lange, Deirdre Shoemaker General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The increasing scope and breadth of gravitational wave detectors is providing the opportunity to explore new parameters in gravitational-wave astronomy. Eccentricity and spin-precession are two key observables to infer the origin of a gravitational wave (GW) source. The interpretation of GW source parameters can be plagued by degeneracy, such as the well-known degeneracy between mass and spin. As the field has explored new parameters, questions have been raised about possible degeneracies between eccentricity and spin-precession. Although some state-of-the-art models now include these effects individually, models that incorporate spin-precession and eccentricity are only in their infancy. Until models faithfully cover the complete parameter space of compact binary coalescence, our ability to correctly measure the source parameters and infer the formation of the binary is compromised. Here, we present a study of the distinguishability of these two key parameters. Our work finds that there is indeed a degeneracy between eccentricity and spin-precession; however, it is a highly localized effect. We find that the misidentified eccentricity estimates get worse as the signal gets shorter. Additionally, this misidentification is highly sensitive to the inclination angle of the source system. We provide quantifiable estimates of the potency of this degeneracy in addition to identifying some of the regions of parameter space where this degeneracy exists.

## 11. Could black hole thermodynamics play a role in black hole mergers?

**Abstract**: Could black hole thermodynamics play a role in black hole mergers? George Ruppeiner General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers yield values for both the black hole remnant mass $M$ and it's spin $a$, with the $169$ $a$ values collected so far crowding significantly around their average $\bar{a}=0.6869\pm 0.087$. Could this crowding relate directly to the Davies phase transition point at $a=0.68125$ from black hole thermodynamics? I argue that a necessary challenge for such a connection requires a consistent application of the thermodynamic fluctuation theory that follows from black hole thermodynamics (BHT). Specifically, necessary are a correct choice of fluctuating variables, as well as thermal equilibrium between the event horizon at the Hawking temperature $\sim \mu K$ and the outside universe $\sim 3 K$. I show that the former requirement follows in straightforward fashion from the BHT of the Kerr model, while the later requires an accretion disk following the Novikov-Thorne accretion disk model. I construct a thermodynamic fluctuation theory meeting both these requirements. My results open the possibility that black hole mergers are based on some dynamical model (not known to me) with a limiting attractor state at the Davies point.

## 12. Schwinger-Keldysh Cosmological Cutting Rules

**Abstract**: Schwinger-Keldysh Cosmological Cutting Rules Francisco Colipí-Marchant, Gabriel Marin, Gonzalo A. Palma, Francisco Rojas High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this work, we study the realisation of unitarity-based cutting rules for primordial cosmological correlators computed within the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral formalism. While cutting rules have been previously derived for wavefunction coefficients, here we examine them directly at the level of cosmological observables expressed diagrammatically. The resulting rules closely resemble those familiar from flat-space scattering amplitudes, but with an additional subtlety: in order to express the discontinuity of a correlator as the product of lower-order correlators, one must introduce a specific combinations of diagrams which do not appear in the computation of observables themselves. We explicitly verify these rules for several classes of correlators, both at tree level and with loop corrections, arising from theories involving different types of interactions.

## 13. Resumming Scattering Amplitudes for Waveforms

**Abstract**: Resumming Scattering Amplitudes for Waveforms Katsuki Aoki, Andrea Cristofoli 46 pages, 4 figures. v2: references added, improved discussion about wavefunction normalisations, added Appendix B on impulse High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We develop a formalism to compute non-perturbative 5-point scattering amplitudes and apply it to gravitational waveforms in the two-body problem for arbitrary trajectories. Drawing inspiration from Feshbach's projector formalism in nuclear physics, we introduce effective potentials governing graviton emission and relate them to perturbative scattering amplitudes at arbitrary order in the gravitational coupling and mass ratio. Once these potentials are determined, the corresponding non-perturbative amplitudes in the classical limit are obtained by iterative insertions and subsequently translated into gravitational waveforms using the KMOC formalism. As an application, we compute the gravitational waveform emitted by a conservative two-body dynamics moving along a generic, potentially highly bent, trajectory. Our formalism extends effective field theory matching of the gravitational two-body potential to radiative phenomena, enabling the extraction of gravitational-wave source terms directly from perturbative on-shell amplitudes.

## 14. Sample-efficient non-Gaussian noise reduction in gravitational wave data via learnable wavelets

**Abstract**: Sample-efficient non-Gaussian noise reduction in gravitational wave data via learnable wavelets Arush Pimpalkar, Digvijay Wadekar, Mark Ho-Yeuk Cheung, Emanuele Berti Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We introduce $\texttt{WaveletNet}$, a wavelet-based neural network architecture to identify and reduce non-Gaussian noise in gravitational wave data. Traditionally, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used as a flexible machine learning method to mitigate non-Gaussian noise. However, training CNNs requires many data samples, especially when the input data segments are long. Glitches that mimic high-mass black hole signals are empirically known to have a wavelet-like structure. We exploit this property in $\texttt{WaveletNet}$ by using simple neural networks to learn the best family of wavelets to model glitches in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 data. Due to its simplicity, our framework is significantly more sample-efficient than CNNs. As a use case, we build upon the $\texttt{TIER}$ method and show how $\texttt{WaveletNet}$ can improve the performance of any search pipeline. We take potential GW candidates from the pipeline, and then downweight the candidates having noisy strain regions in their vicinity. We use our framework in a modular way: we provide an output score which can be added to the pipeline's existing detection statistic score for the candidates. We test our method using candidates from the $\texttt{IAS-HM}$ search pipeline and show that it improves the search sensitive volume by up to 15% for high-mass, asymmetric binaries.

**Abstract**: SiGMa-Net II: Distinguishing Binary Black Holes from Glitches Soorya Narayan, Anupreeta More, Sunil Choudhary, Sudhagar Suyamprakasam, Sukanta Bose 8 pages, 5 figures, no appendix Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) With increasing sensitivity of the gravitational wave (GW) detectors, we expect a significant rise in the detectable GW events. To process, analyse and identify such large amounts of GW signals arising from mergers of Binary Black Holes (BBH), we need both speed and accuracy. In the search for (massive) BBH signals, the biggest hurdle is posed by the various non-gaussian noise transients called glitches. Compared to our previous work, which used a simple convolutional neural network to distinguish BBHs from Blip glitches, this work uses transfer learning with InceptionNetV3 to distinguish BBHs from six types of most popular glitches from the third observing run of LIGO. While the glitches are real and identified via GravitySpy, the BBH signals are simulated and then injected into the real detector noise for each of the two LIGO detectors. We generate Sine-Gaussian Projection (SGP) maps by cross-correlating data with Sine-Gaussian functions of varied quality factors ($Q$) and central frequencies ($f_0$) and projected on the $Q$ - $f_0$ plane. We find that SGP maps make it easier to distinguish BBHs from glitches that look very similar to BBHs in the Time-Frequency maps like the Blips, while also maintaining significant morphological differences between BBHs and the more frequent glitches - Scattered Light and Fast Scattering. Our network has an accuracy of $87%$, a TPR of 0.83 for an FPR of 0.1 on our test dataset. It is also robust, retaining its level of accuracy, when tested on real BBH events identified in the first three observing runs of LIGO. Our proposed method shows the viability of using the SGP maps and neural networks for fast identification of GW events improving the efficiency of standard search pipelines.

## 16. From South to North: Leveraging Ground-Based LATs for Full-Sky CMB Delensing and Constraints on $r$

**Abstract**: From South to North: Leveraging Ground-Based LATs for Full-Sky CMB Delensing and Constraints on $r$ Wen-Zheng Chen, Yang Liu, Yi-Ming Wang, Hong Li 49 pages, 21 figures, 12 tables, published in JCAP Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Delensing--the process of mitigating the lensing-induced B-mode contamination in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations--will be a pivotal challenge for next-generation CMB experiments seeking to detect primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) through B-mode polarization. This process requires an accurate lensing tracer, which can be obtained either through internal reconstruction from high-resolution CMB observations or from external large-scale structure (LSS) surveys. Ground-based large-aperture telescopes (LATs) are crucial for internal reconstruction, yet existing and planned facilities are confined to the southern hemisphere, limiting effective delensing to that region. In this work, we assess the impact of introducing a northern hemisphere LAT, assumed to be situated near AliCPT (hence termed Ali-like LAT, or LATN), on delensing performance and PGW detection, using simulations. Our baseline setup includes a space-based small-aperture mission (LiteBIRD-like, SAT) and a southern LAT (SO-like, LATS). External LSS tracers, which have been shown to play an important role in delensing before the availability of ultra-sensitive polarization data, are also considered. We find that southern-hemisphere internal delensing reduces the uncertainty in r by approximately 21% compared to the no-delensing case. Adding LATN enables full-sky internal delensing, achieving a further ~19% reduction--comparable to that from including LSS tracers (~17%). Once LATN is included, the marginal benefit of LSS tracers drops to ~10%. These results highlight the significant role of LATN in advancing delensing capabilities and improving PGW constraints.

Phys. J. C High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We propose a new extension of the Standard Model that incorporates a gauged \( U(1)_{\rm B-L} \) symmetry and the type-III seesaw mechanism to explain neutrino mass generation and provide a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. Unlike the type-I seesaw, the type-III seesaw extension under \( U(1)_{\rm B-L} \) is not automatically anomaly-free. We show that these anomalies can be canceled by introducing additional chiral fermions, which naturally emerge as DM candidates in the model. We thoroughly analyze the DM phenomenology, including relic density, direct and indirect detection prospects, and constraints from current experimental data. Furthermore, we explore the collider signatures of the model, highlighting the enhanced production cross-section of the triplet fermions mediated by the \( \rm B-L \) gauge boson, as well as the potential disappearing track signatures. Additionally, we investigate the gravitational wave signals arising from the first-order phase transition during \( \rm B-L \) symmetry breaking, offering a complementary cosmological probe of the framework.

Accepted for Publication on Universe. 2026 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The gravitational wave event GW190521 seems to be the only BH merger event possibly correlated with an electromagnetic counterpart, which appeared about 34 days after the GW event. This work aims to confirm that the electromagnetic bump towards the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) J1249+3449 can be explained within the framework of the gravitational microlensing phenomenon. In particular, considering the data of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), what emerges from a detailed analysis of the observed light curve using three fitting models (Point Source Point Lens, Finite Source Point Lens, Uniform Source Binary Lens) is that the optical bump can be explained as a microlensing event caused by a lens with mass {$\sim\,$0.1 $M_{\odot}$}, lying in the host galaxy of the AGN in question.} %MDPI: Please confirm if the bold formatting is necessary; if not, please remove it.

**Abstract**: Exploring the role of accretion shocks in galaxy clusters as sources of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays A.D. Supanitsky, S.E. Nuza Accepted for publication in PRD High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Recently, the Pierre Auger Observatory has found strong evidence supporting the extragalactic origin of the most energetic cosmic rays. Despite several observed excesses in the distribution of arrival directions for the highest energy cosmic rays, the sources remain unidentified. Accretion shocks in galaxy clusters have been proposed as potential sources in the past. These immense shock waves, which can have radii on the order of megaparsecs, are generated by the infall of material from the intergalactic medium into the gravitational potential wells of galaxy clusters. In this work, we investigate the possibility that ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays are accelerated in these regions. Nearby massive galaxy clusters, including Virgo, are treated as a discrete component of the cluster mass distribution. Less massive galaxy clusters, as well as distant massive ones, are assumed to follow a continuous distribution in agreement with cluster mass statistics. We fit the flux at Earth and the composition profile measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory, assuming the injection of different nuclear species by these sources, to determine the values of the model parameters. Our results indicate that cosmic ray acceleration in cluster accretion shocks may account for at least a fraction of the observed UHECR flux at energies below the suppression scale. At higher energies, direct acceleration from the thermal pool would be feasible only if local fluctuations create favorable conditions, such as magnetic fields about an order of magnitude stronger than those typically expected in cluster accretion shocks, or for particular shock normal-magnetic field configurations.

**Abstract**: Large Gravitational Wave Phase Shifts from Strong 3-body Interactions in Dense Stellar Clusters Kai Hendriks, Dany Atallah, Miguel Martinez, Michael Zevin, Lorenz Zwick, Alessandro A. Trani, Pankaj Saini, János Takátsy, Johan Samsing High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The phase evolution of gravitational waves (GWs) can be modulated by the astrophysical environment surrounding the source, which provides a probe for the origin of individual binary black holes (BBHs) using GWs alone. We here study the evolving phase of the GW waveform derived from a large set of simulations of BBH mergers forming in dense stellar clusters through binary-single interactions. We uncover that a well-defined fraction of the assembled eccentric GW sources will have a notable GW phase shift induced by the remaining third object. The magnitude of the GW phase shift often exceeds conservative analytical estimates due to strong 3-body interactions, which occasionally results in GW sources with clearly shifted and perturbed GW waveforms. This opens up promising opportunities for current and future GW detectors, as observing such a phase shift can identify the formation environment of a BBH, as well as help to characterise the local properties of its surrounding environment.

Erpenbeck, W. Esmail, S. Eulig, J. Evans, P. A. Evenson, K. L. Fan, K. Fang, K. Farrag High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The discovery of joint sources of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves has been a primary target for the LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and IceCube observatories. The joint detection of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves would provide insight into cosmic processes, from the dynamics of compact object mergers and stellar collapses to the mechanisms driving relativistic outflows. The joint detection of multiple cosmic messengers can also elevate the significance of the common observation even when some or all of the constituent messengers are sub-threshold, i.e. not significant enough to declare their detection individually. Using data from the LIGO, Virgo, and IceCube observatories, including sub-threshold events, we searched for common sources of gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos during the third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Our search did not identify significant joint sources. We derive constraints on the rate densities of joint sources. Our results constrain the isotropic neutrino emission from gravitational-wave sources for very high values of the total energy emitted in neutrinos (> $10^{52} - 10^{54}$ erg).

**Abstract**: tilepy: A Flexible Open-Source Scheduling Engine for Time-Domain and Multi-Messenger Astronomy Fabian Schüssler, H. Ashkar, W. Kiendrébéogo, M. Seglar-Arroyo, M. de Bony, A. Berti, E. Ruiz-Velasco, R. Le Montagner Proceedings 35th annual conference on Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems (ADASS XXXV, Görlitz/Germany, 2025) Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The era of multi-messenger astrophysics requires rapid and efficient follow-up of transient events, many of which, such as gravitational waves (GW), gamma-ray bursts (GRB), and high-energy neutrinos, suffer from poor sky localisation. We present tilepy, a Python-based software designed to optimize observation schedules for these events. We here detail the modular architecture of tilepy, which separates high-level scheduling logic from low-level tiling and pointing tools, enabling full adaptability for ground- and space-based observatories. Furthermore, we describe the integration of tilepy into the Astro-COLIBRI platform, providing the community with a user-friendly interface and API for triggering complex observation campaigns in real time.

## 23. Visualisation of spherical harmonics in Peirce's quincuncial projection

**Abstract**: Visualisation of spherical harmonics in Peirce's quincuncial projection Bjoern Malte Schaefer (ZAH, Heidelberg University) 12 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in the Springer "Handbook of Visual, Experimental and Computational Mathematics - Bridges through Data" edited by B. Sriraman Classical Physics (physics.class-ph); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The spherical harmonics $Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\varphi)$ are complex-valued functions on the surface of a sphere, and have found widespread application in physics and astronomy. Every physics students knows them from quantum mechanics and electromagnetic theory, where they form the basis of hydrogen orbitals and of the multipole expansion, respectively. More advanced applications include the physics of the cosmic microwave background, gravitational lensing, and gravitational waves. In this paper I aim to contrast their usual $3d$ visualisation with Peirce's quincuncial projection, a conformal projection of the sphere onto a $2d$ unfolded square dihedron, where the projection respects the fundamental rotational symmetries and preserves angles. With this mapping, I guide the reader through the properties of the spherical harmonics in a pedagogical way and show that many of their mathematical relations have an intuitive visualisation on Peirce's $2d$ map, which might be useful for people challenged by processing $3d$ shapes, or which people might appreciate aesthetically.
