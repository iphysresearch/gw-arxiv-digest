**Abstract**: Global time-frequency search for stellar-mass binary black holes in LISA Diganta Bandopadhyay, Christian E. A. Chapman-Bird, Alberto Vecchio General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We present a complete pipeline for detecting and characterising gravitational waves (GWs) produced by the inspiral of stellar-mass binary black holes in data from the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The analysis framework relies on an efficient time-frequency implementation of an adaptive semi-coherent detection statistic, which we show to be robust against non-stationary noise and the presence of gaps of varying duration and cadence. The search is able to detect signals down to a coherent signal-to-noise ratio $\approx$ 11 over the full parameter space of black holes with spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum and orbital eccentricity $\leq$ 0.01 when deployed on the 2-year-long LISA Data Challenge Yorsh. The search can be run within a day using $\approx$ 40 GPUs. The techniques presented here have wider applications in GW astronomy, in particular the search for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals in LISA data.

## 2. Probing Binary Black Hole Formation Channels through Cosmic Large-Scale Structure

**Abstract**: Probing Binary Black Hole Formation Channels through Cosmic Large-Scale Structure William J. Smith, Krystal Ruiz-Rocha, Kelly Holley-Bockelmann, Michela Mapelli, Karan Jani General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The growing number of binary black hole mergers detected through gravitational waves offers unprecedented insight into their underlying population, yet their astrophysical formation channels remain unresolved. We present a new method to distinguish binary black hole formation channels using their spatial clustering at cosmological scales. Employing the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation Illustris, we trace the distribution of mergers across cosmic time and compare them with the underlying matter distribution associated with three candidate origins: isolated binary stellar evolution, binaries embedded in AGN disks, and primordial black holes within dark matter halos. For mergers at redshift $z \lesssim 0.5$, these channels show distinct clustering signatures that could be accessible with proposed upgrades to current ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. Using mock catalogs for next- generation facilities such as Cosmic Explorer, we find that their sensitivities would enable differentiation of these formation pathways out to redshift $z \sim 5$ within the first decade of observations. This approach provides a new framework to link gravitational-wave populations with the large-scale structure of the Universe. By treating black hole mergers as cosmological tracers, our results demonstrate how cross- correlations between gravitational-wave catalogs and the cosmic matter field can constrain the relative contribution of stellar, AGN, and primordial channels, offering a complementary probe to population- inference studies. These findings underscore the emerging potential of gravitational-wave cosmology to reveal where and how black holes form and merge across cosmic history.

**Abstract**: Numerical simulations of Scalar Dark Matter Around Binary Neutron Star mergers Rohan Srikanth, Tim Dietrich, Katy Clough General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Binary neutron star mergers provide a laboratory for probing fundamental physics through their gravitational- wave emission and electromagnetic counterparts. In particular, they may allow us to explore signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model in strong-gravity regimes, such as those of dark matter. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of light dark matter, modeled as a minimally coupled scalar field, surrounding a binary neutron star system. Our primary focus is to assess whether the scalar field remains bound to the binary over the late inspiral-merger timescales and to determine its potential impact on observable signatures. We find that, in a range of scenarios, the scalar field forms a common cloud around the binary that does not disperse. At sufficiently high densities, this leads to measurable effects, including a dephasing of the binary inspiral, a less compact post-merger remnant, and suppression of the dynamical ejecta. For densities motivated by astrophysical considerations, however, these effects remain small and are unlikely to be detectable with current or next-generation gravitational-wave observatories.

**Abstract**: Effects of Dynamical Capture on two equal-mass non-spinning black holes Jorge L. Rodr√≠guez-Monteverde, Santiago Jaraba, Juan Garc√≠a-Bellido 18 pages, 13 figures and 4 tables General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Dynamical captures of black holes are unique events that provide an exceptional opportunity to probe the strong-field regime of gravitational physics. In this article, we perform numerical relativity simulations to study the events of dynamical capture of two equal-mass non-spinning black holes. We consider a suite of scenarios within a range of initial linear momenta ($p/M=0.095-0.75$) and incidence angles ($\theta=6.36^\circ-2.83^\circ$), and study the emitted Weyl scalar ($\Psi_4$) of each case, as well as the spins and masses of the black holes before and after they merge. We provide a simple analytical model which accurately fits the gravitational-wave emission. We study the dependence of the time-interval between the capture and the merger emissions with respect to the incidence angle, which can be well parametrized by a first-order divergent behavior, allowing to find the angle that separates a scattering event from a dynamical capture. We also find that, in general, the parameters that model the first emission can be well described by linear or exponentially decaying functions in terms of the incidence angle, while others display more complex behaviors that offer valuable insights into the nature of these events.

**Abstract**: Semiclassical cosmic string evaporation Robert Penna High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We describe a new tunneling solution for the decay of a cosmic string into a burst of gravitational waves. We find the relevant instanton and compute the tunneling rate. Locally, our solution is just an analytic continuation of the Kerr metric (but there is no black hole in our solution). An interesting feature of our result is that there is a conical singularity in the initial state but there is no singularity in the final state. This demonstrates that singularities can disappear in quantum gravity in ways that are impossible in classical gravity.

Cembranos, √Ålvaro Cendal High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Dark matter may not be perfectly stable, and its decay could generate distinctive gravitational-wave signatures. In this work, we present model-independent predictions for the stochastic gravitational-wave background arising from the decay of ultralight dark matter into gravitons. Within this framework, we forecast the sensitivity reach of current and forthcoming gravitational-wave detectors to such signals.

**Abstract**: Can the Near-Horizon Black Hole Memory be detected through Binary Inspirals? Sajad A. Bhat, Srijit Bhattacharjee, Shasvath J. Kapadia Phys. Rev. D 112, 024068 (2025) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The memory effect, in the context of gravitational-waves (GWs), manifests itself in the permanent relative displacement of test masses when they encounter the GWs. A number of works have explored the possibility of detecting the memory when the source and detector are separated by large distances. A special type of memory, arising from BMS symmetries, called ``black-hole memory'', has been recently proposed. The black hole memory only manifests itself in the vicinity of its event horizon. Therefore, formally observing it requires placing a GW detector at the horizon of the BH, which prima-facie seems unfeasible. In this work, we describe a toy model that suggests a possible way the black hole memory may be observed, without requiring a human-made detector near the event horizon. The model considers a binary black hole (BBH), emanating GWs observable at cosmological distances, as a proxy for an idealized detector in the vicinity of a supermassive Schwarzschild black hole that is endowed with a supertranslation hair by sending a shock-wave to it. This sudden change affects the geometry near the horizon of the supertranslated black hole and it induces a change in the inspiraling orbital separation (and hence, orbital frequency) of the binary, which in turn imprints itself on the GWs. Using basic GW data analysis tools, we demonstrate that the black hole memory should be observable by a LISA-like space-based detector.

## 8. Inflationary Gravitational Waves as a probe of the unknown post-inflationary primordial Universe

**Abstract**: Inflationary Gravitational Waves as a probe of the unknown post-inflationary primordial Universe Athul K. Soman, Swagat S. Mishra, Mohammed Shafi, Soumen Basak Main text: 30 pages, 12 captioned figures (additional details in 5 appendices), Github link provided in the paper, Final version with additional text, references and an extra appendix, Matches accepted version in PRD General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) One of the key predictions of the standard inflationary paradigm is the quantum mechanical generation of the transverse and traceless tensor fluctuations due to the rapid accelerated expansion of space, which later constitute a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The amplitude of the (nearly) scale-invariant inflationary tensor power spectrum at large scales provides us with crucial information about the energy scale of inflation in the case of the minimal inflaton coupling to gravity. Furthermore, the spectral energy density, $\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}(f)$, of the GWs at sufficiently small scales (or, large frequencies $f$) serves as an important observational probe of post-inflationary primordial dynamics. In fact, the small-scale spectral tilt, $n_{_{\rm GW}} = \frac{{\rm d}\log{\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}}}{{\rm d}\log{f}}$, of the spectral energy density of GWs is sensitive to the (unknown) post-inflationary equation of state (EoS), $w$, of the universe; with a softer EoS ($w < 1/3$) leading to a red tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} < 0$, while a stiffer EoS ($w > 1/3$) resulting in a blue tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} > 0$. The post-inflationary dynamics, however, is generically expected to be quite complex, potentially involving a number of distinct phases. Hence, in this work, we discuss the possibility of multiple sharp transitions, namely $w_1 \to w_2 \to w_3 \to ... \to w_n$, in the EoS of the post-inflationary universe and compute the corresponding spectral energy density of the inflationary GWs. We explicitly determine the region of the parameter space $\lbrace{ w_1, \, w_2, \, w_3, ..., w_n\rbrace}$ which leads to a potentially detectable signal in the upcoming GW detectors, without violating the current constraints.

**Abstract**: On energy-momentum tensor for gravitational waves in $f(R)$ gravity Petr V. Tretyakov, Alexander N. Petrov Eur.Phys.J.C 85 (2025) 10, 1162 General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The classical Isaacson's procedure for describing back-reaction of the averaged energy-momentum for high frequency gravitational waves is generalized to the $f(R)$ gravity case. From the beginning it is assumed that an initial background could be arbitrary one. Then, we restrict the background to be de Sitter, which is a novelty regarding the study of a back-reaction in $f(R)$ gravity. Consideration of the de Sitter space as a background spacetime allows us to provide the averaging procedure completely. Using the results on the de Sitter space and generalizing the Isaacson procedure, we construct the averaged energy-momentum on an additionally curved (averaged) background. Consistency tests for de Sitter spacetime are performed both at the background and perturbative regimes. Our results generalize previous studies in which the authors consider the flat (Minkowski) spacetime as the initial background.

**Abstract**: Gravitational waves from eccentric binary neutron star mergers: Systematic biases and inadequacy of quasicircular templates Giulia Huez, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Matteo Breschi, Rossella Gamba Phys. Rev. D 112, 084054 (2025) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The use of quasicircular waveforms in matched-filter analyses of signals from eccentric binary neutron star mergers can lead to biases in the source's parameter estimation. We demonstrate that significant biases can be present already for moderate eccentricities $e_{0} \gtrsim 0.05$ and signals detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA with signal-to-noise ratio $\gtrsim 12$. We perform systematic Bayesian mock analyses of unequal-mass nonspinning binary neutron star signals up to eccentricities $e_0 \sim 0.1$ using quasicircular effective-one-body waveforms with spins. We find fractional signal-to-noise ratio losses up to tens of percent and up to 16$\sigma$ deviations in the inference of the chirp mass. The latter effect is sufficiently large to lead to an incorrect (and ambiguous) source identification. The inclusion of spin precession in the quasicircular waveform does not capture eccentricity effects. We conclude that high-precision observations with advanced (and next generation) detectors are likely to require standardized, accurate, and fast eccentric waveforms.

## 11. Constraining scalar-tensor theories from higher harmonics with GW230529

**Abstract**: Constraining scalar-tensor theories from higher harmonics with GW230529 Baoxiang Wang, Tao Yang 18 pages, 5 figures, published in JCAP General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The Advanced LIGO and Virgo collaborations recently detected a gravitational wave event, GW230529\_181500, during the fourth observing run, which is most plausibly attributed to the merger of a neutron star and a black hole. This observation provides an opportunity to test a class of gravitational theories that deviate from general relativity. In such theories, additional terms contribute to the gravitational wave signal only in cases of asymmetric binaries. This study focuses on two scalar-tensor models within this class of theories: the Screened Modified Gravity and Brans-Dicke theory. These models have potential applications in areas such as dark matter, dark energy, cosmic inflation, and primordial nucleosynthesis. With the GW230529\_181500 and Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo analyses, we derive a 90\% credible lower bound as $ \frac{\varphi_{\rm_{VEV}}}{M_{\rm Pl}}<1.7\times10^{-2}$ and $\omega_{\rm BD}>25.12$ by using dominant mode correction. Asymmetric binary systems usually have a significant mass ratio, in such cases, higher harmonic modes cannot be neglected. Our work considers higher harmonic corrections from scalar-tensor theories and provides a tighter constraint of $ \frac{\varphi_{\rm_{VEV}}}{M_{\rm Pl}}<1.5\times10^{-2}$ and $\omega_{\rm BD}>32.68$, with a 13.3\% and 30.1\% improvement respectively. Combining GW230529\_181500, GW200115 and GW190814 and including higher modes, the constraint is improved to $\frac{\varphi_{\rm_{VEV}}}{M_{\rm Pl}}<7.84\times10^{-3}$ and $\omega_{\rm BD}>123.75$. This is currently the strongest constraint from GWs, contingent upon GW190814 being an NSBH event.

**Abstract**: Gas-induced perturbations on the gravitational wave in-spiral of live post-Newtonian LISA massive black hole binaries Mudit Garg, Alessia Franchini, Alessandro Lupi, Matteo Bonetti, Lucio Mayer 10 pages, 4 figures. Accepted by ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate the effect of dynamically coupling gas torques with gravitational wave (GW) emission during the orbital evolution of an equal-mass massive black hole binary (MBHB). We perform hydrodynamical simulations of eccentric MBHBs with total mass $M=10^6~{\rm M}_\odot$ embedded in a prograde locally isothermal circumbinary disk (CBD). We evolve the binary from $55$ to $49$ Schwarzschild radii separations using up to 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the binary dynamics, which allow us to follow the GW-driven in-spiral. For the first time, we report the measurement of gas torques onto a live binary a few years before the merger, with and without concurrent GW radiation. We also report the gas-induced orbital dephasing $\delta \phi_{\rm orb}\sim-0.007$ rad over $278$ orbital cycles that is likely driven mainly by disc-induced precession and LISA should be able to detect it at redshift $z=1$. Our results show how GWs alone can be used to probe the astrophysical properties of CBDs and have important implications for multi-messenger strategies aimed at studying the environments of MBHBs.

Motivated by ongoing debates surrounding back-reaction effects and observed anomalies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), we investigate whether a departure from isotropy in the late Universe could reconcile the observed discrepancies in Hubble constant measurements. Using a Bayesian inference framework, we constrain the model parameters employing multiple nested sampling algorithms: bilby, PyMultiNest, and nessai. We perform the analysis under both uniform and Gaussian priors, allowing us to systematically assess the sensitivity of the inferred cosmological parameters to different prior assumptions. This dual-prior strategy balances agnostic parameter exploration with constraints informed by theory and observation. Our findings demonstrate the reliability of our inference pipeline across different samplers and emphasize the crucial role of prior selection in non-standard cosmological model testing. The results suggest that anisotropic models remain viable contenders in addressing current cosmological tensions: even though the present model does not show alleviation of the Hubble tension, the data points towards anisotropies. Future work may extend this methodology to more complex anisotropic scenarios and incorporate additional cosmological probes such as CMB polarization and gravitational wave standard sirens.

**Abstract**: Scalar fields around black hole binaries in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Soumen Roy, Rodrigo Vicente, Josu C. Aurrekoetxea, Katy Clough, Pedro G. Ferreira Comment are welcome. A visualization of our simulations and waveforms can be found at this https URL General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Light scalar particles arise naturally in many extensions of the Standard Model and are well-motivated dark matter candidates. Gravitational interactions near black holes can trigger the growth of dense scalar configurations that, if sustained during inspiral, alter binary dynamics and imprint signatures on gravitational-wave signals. Detecting such effects would provide a novel probe of fundamental physics and dark matter. Here we develop a semi-analytic waveform model for binaries in scalar environments, validated against numerical relativity simulations, and apply it in a Bayesian analysis of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog. Our results set physically meaningful upper bounds on scalar environments around compact binaries. When superradiance priors are included, we find tentative evidence for such an environment in GW190728 with $\ln B_{\mathrm{vac}}^{\mathrm{env}} \approx 3.5$, which would correspond to the existence of a light scalar field with mass $\sim 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV}$.

**Abstract**: Primordial black holes with mass ratio-modulated initial clustering: merger suppression and projected constraints Gabriel Luis Dizon (National Institute of Physics, University of the Philippines - Diliman) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present a modification of the expected local primordial black hole (PBH) count $N(y)$, typically seen in the context of the early PBH binary merger rate as a term in the merger rate suppression. We utilize recent results in small-scale PBH clustering to formulate $N(y)$ in such a way that accounts for variations in the binary mass ratio $q$. We then examine how this change affects the projected constraints on PBH abundance from simulated Einstein Telescope (ET) and LISA mergers. Our results indicate that for broadly extended mass distributions, the merger suppression is greatly reduced for binaries with $q \gg 1$. This leads to an enhanced merger rate for binary distributions favoring a lighter average mass. This change is best reflected by an extension of the low mass end of the constraint windows derived from the resolvable merger channel, although this result is present as well in the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) constraints. Our results imply that the assumption of PBH clustering is testable at abundances and mass ranges much lower than anticipated, although more work must be done to explore how high mass ratio PBH binaries actually evolve.

In our framework, ultra high energy neutrinos originate from the decay of a super-heavy sterile neutrino produced via the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early Universe. Employing an ultraviolet complete type-I seesaw model, we demonstrate that while two sterile neutrinos are responsible for light neutrino masses as required by oscillation data, one sterile neutrino can have an exceedingly feeble coupling, allowing its lifetime to be tuned so that its decay yields a neutrino flux consistent with the observed event. Furthermore, our scenario predicts two distinct GW signatures: one arising from gravitons emitted during PBH evaporation and another from the Bremsstrahlung process during the decay of the sterile neutrino. These complementary signals provide a multi-messenger probe of the underlying physics. Our results thus offer a compelling explanation for the KM3-230213A event and open new avenues for investigating the interplay between high-energy neutrino astronomy and gravitational wave cosmology.

**Abstract**: Superconducting Strings in $E_6$ Rinku Maji, Qaisar Shafi 6 pages (two-column format), 4 figures, 1 table; typo corrected; accepted for publication as a Letter in Physical Review D High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We discuss the appearance of superconducting strings in $E_6$ grand unification, keeping track of the magnetic monopole flux that precedes the formation of the string flux tube. This flux matching ensures compatibility with the quantum tunneling of a monopole-antimonopole pair on a metastable string. We identify two realistic $E_6$ models with superconducting (metastable) strings that also carry zero modes of the right handed Majorana neutrinos and dark matter particles. Depending on the symmetry breaking scale associated with the strings, the latter could be a source of observable gravitational waves, intermediate scale dark matter, and the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis. Topologically stable superconducting strings also appear if the $E_6$ symmetry breaking leaves unbroken the $Z_2$ subgroup of $Z_4$, the center of $SO(10)$. The zero modes of the SM fermions are the charge carriers in this case. Finally, the flux matching condition ensures that the Aharanov-Bohm phase change in going around the metastable strings is an integer multiple of $2 \pi$ for all fields. The fields in the spinorial representation of SO(10) acquire a phase change of $\exp(\pm i\pi)$ if taken around the topologically stable $Z_2$ string.

Zhang, S.-N. Zhang, Y.-H. Zhang High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Stars captured by black holes (BHs) can be torn apart by strong tidal forces, producing electromagnetic flares. To date, more than 100 tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been observed, each involving invariably normal gaseous stars whose debris falls onto the BH, sustaining the flares over years. White dwarfs (WDs), which are the most prevalent compact stars and a million times denser--and therefore tougher--than gaseous stars, can only be disrupted by intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) of 10^2--10^5 solar masses. WD-TDEs are considered to generate more powerful and short-lived flares, but their evidence has been lacking. Here we report observations of a fast and luminous X-ray transient EP250702a detected by Einstein Probe. Its one-day-long X-ray peak as luminous as 10^(47-49) erg/s showed strong recurrent flares with hard spectra extending to several tens of MeV gamma-rays, as detected by Fermi/GBM and Konus-Wind, indicating relativistic jet emission. The jet's X-ray dropped sharply from 3 x 10^49 erg/s to around 10^44 erg/s within 20 days (10 days in the source rest frame). These characteristics are inconsistent with any known transient phenomena other than a jetted-TDE evolving over an unprecedentedly short timescale, indicating the disruption of a WD by an IMBH. At late times, a new soft component progressively dominates the X-ray spectrum, exhibiting an extreme super-Eddington luminosity, which possibly originates from an accretion disc. WD-TDEs open a new window for investigating the elusive IMBHs and their surrounding stellar environments, and they are prime sources of gravitational waves in the band of space-based interferometers.
