**Abstract**: Gravitomagnetic-Hydrodynamics and Turbulence in Early Universe Jiaxiang Liang, Peng Xu, Minghui Du, Yifu Cheng, Zhan Wang, Ziren Luo General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) This work tries to establish the theoretical framework for gravitomagnetic-hydrodynamics (GMHD), revealing a fundamental correspondence between geometrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamic phenomena in general relativity. By introducing the gravitoelectromagnetic formalism to relativistic fluids, a set of leading-order GMHD equations is derived that govern the co-evolution of spacetime geometry and matter dynamics in the early Universe. This analysis reveals that, under high-temperature and high-density conditions such as those during the electroweak phase transition, the gravitomagnetic Reynolds number becomes large, leading to a strongly coupled fluid-spacetime system. This coupling supports the emergence of gravitational Alfven waves and a turbulent energy cascade. Our findings suggest that GMHD turbulence may leave imprints on the stochastic gravitational wave background, offering a new window into the nonlinear dynamics of the primordial Universe.

**Abstract**: Biased parameter inference of eccentric, spin-precessing binary black holes Divyajyoti, Isobel M. Romero-Shaw, Vaishak Prasad, Kaushik Paul, Chandra Kant Mishra, Prayush Kumar, Akash Maurya, Michael Boyle, Lawrence E. Kidder, Harald P. Pfeiffer, Mark A. Scheel General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) While the majority of gravitational wave (GW) events observed by the LIGO and Virgo detectors are consistent with mergers of binary black holes (BBHs) on quasi-circular orbits, some events are also consistent with non-zero orbital eccentricity, indicating that the binaries could have formed via dynamical interactions. Moreover, there may be GW events which show support for spin-precession, eccentricity, or both. In this work, we study the interplay of spins and eccentricity on the parameter estimation of GW signals from BBH mergers. We inject eccentric signals with no spins, aligned spins, and precessing spins using hybrids, TEOBResumS-DALI, and new Numerical Relativity (NR) simulations, respectively, and study the biases in the posteriors of source parameters when these signals are recovered with a quasi-circular precessing-spin waveform model, as opposed to an aligned-spin eccentric waveform model. We find significant biases in the source parameters, such as chirp mass and spin-precession ($\chi_p$), when signals from highly-eccentric BBHs are recovered with a quasi-circular waveform model. Moreover, we find that for signals with both eccentricity and spin-precession effects, Bayes factor calculations confirm that an eccentric, aligned-spin model is preferred over a quasi-circular precessing-spin model. Our study highlights the complex nature of GW signals from eccentric, precessing-spin binaries and the need for readily usable inspiral-merger-ringdown eccentric, spin-precessing waveform models for unbiased parameter estimation.

**Abstract**: Scattering of massive neutrino test fields from a gravitational pulse Tekin Dereli, Yorgo Senikoglu General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Linearized Einstein-Weyl equations are solved precisely in the context of sandwich gravitational waves. The neutrino's energy-momentum depends on the geometry and composition of the gravitational pulse when it is scattered. Since the background remains unchanged at the test field level, the neutrino's energy density will exhibit fluctuations between positive and negative extremes when traversing the sandwich wave. These variations could provide insights into the behavior of models concerning neutrino oscillations.

**Abstract**: Testing black hole metrics with binary black hole inspirals Zhe Zhao, Swarnim Shashank, Debtroy Das, Cosimo Bambi General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Gravitational wave astronomy has opened an unprecedented window onto tests of gravity and fundamental physics in the strong-field regime. In this study, we examine a series of well-motivated deviations from the classical Kerr solution of General Relativity and employ gravitational wave data to place constraints on possible deviations from the Kerr geometry. The method involves calculating the phase of gravitational waves using the effective one-body formalism and then applying the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework to constrain the parameters appearing in these scenarios beyond General Relativity. The effective one-body method, known for its capability to model complex gravitational waveforms, is used to compute the wave phase, and the post-Einsteinian framework allows for a flexible, model-independent approach to parameter estimation. We demonstrate that gravitational wave data provide evidence supporting the Kerr nature of black holes, showing no significant deviations from General Relativity, thereby affirming its validity within the current observational limits. This work bridges theoretical waveform modeling with observational constraints, providing a pathway to test the no-hair theorem and probe the astrophysical viability of modified black holes.

## 5. Inferring the spins of merging black holes in the presence of data-quality issues

**Abstract**: Inferring the spins of merging black holes in the presence of data-quality issues Rhiannon Udall, Sophie Bini, Katerina Chatziioannou, Derek Davis, Sophie Hourihane, Yannick Lecoeuche, Jess McIver, Simona Miller General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Gravitational waves from black hole binary mergers carry information about the component spins, but inference is sensitive to analysis assumptions, which may be broken by terrestrial noise transients known as glitches. Using a variety of simulated glitches and gravitational wave signals, we study the conditions under which glitches can bias spin measurements. We confirm the theoretical expectation that inference and subtraction of glitches invariably leaves behind residual power due to statistical uncertainty, no matter the strength (signal-to-noise ratio; SNR) of the original glitch. Next we show that low-SNR glitches - including those below the threshold for flagging data-quality issues - can still significantly bias spin inference. Such biases occur for a range of glitch morphologies, even in cases where glitches and signals are not precisely aligned in phase. Furthermore, we find that residuals of glitch subtraction can result in biases as well. Our results suggest that joint inference of the glitch and gravitational wave parameters, with appropriate models and priors, is required to address these uncertainties inherent in glitch mitigation via subtraction.

**Abstract**: Finding Supermassive Black Hole Binary Mergers in Pulsar Timing Array Data Sharon Mary Tomson, Boris Goncharov, Rutger van Haasteren High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Galaxy observations suggest there is about one merger of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB) throughout the observable universe in a year. Here, we introduce the methodology to search for gravitational waves from these events with Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). Modelling the inspiral, the merger, the ringdown, and the gravitational wave memory components of the signal in simulated data, we demonstrate a proof of principle for detection and parameter estimation. We study a few representative SMBHB mergers with chirp masses spanning $10^{8} - 10^{10}~M_\odot$ at distances from a few Mpc to 100~Mpc to asses their detectability in PTA observations. Assuming the fixed binary inclination angle of $90^{\circ}$ corresponding to the maximum displacement memory signal, these signals appear distinct for a PTA with 25 pulsars timed for 13 years with 100 ns precision. We demonstrate the capabilities of PTAs to constrain chirp masses and distances of detected merging binaries, as well as to place limits. The sky position uncertainties of the order of $1^{\circ}$, which we find in this optimistic example, could potentially enable electromagnetic follow-up and multi-messenger observations of SMBHB mergers. Finally, we show that the measurement uncertainties on the parameters of simulated merging binaries depend weakly on the presence of the gravitational wave background with Hellings-Downs correlations in our simulated data.

**Abstract**: Identifying and Mitigating Machine Learning Biases for the Gravitational Wave Detection Problem Narenraju Nagarajan, Christopher Messenger 41 pages (34 pages main text), 24 figures General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Matched filtering is a long-standing technique for the optimal detection of known signals in stationary Gaussian noise. However, it has known departures from optimality when operating on unknown signals in real noise and suffers from computational inefficiencies in its pursuit of near-optimality. A compelling alternative that has emerged in recent years to address this problem is deep learning. Although it has shown significant promise when applied to the search for gravitational waves (GWs) in detector noise, we demonstrate the existence of learning biases that hinder generalisation and lead to significant loss in detection sensitivity. Our work identifies the sources of a set of 11 interconnected biases present in the supervised learning of the GW detection problem and contributes mitigation tactics and training strategies to concurrently address them. In light of the identified biases, we demonstrate that existing detection sensitivity metrics are not reliable for machine-learning (ML) pipelines and discuss the trustworthiness of previous results. We use GW domain knowledge to build a bespoke ML based binary black hole search pipeline called Sage that addresses these biases. Via the injection study presented in the Machine Learning Gravitational-Wave Search Challenge, we show that Sage detects ~11.2% more signals than the benchmark PyCBC analysis at a false alarm rate of one per month in O3a noise. Moreover, we also show that it can detect ~48.29% more signals than the previous best-performing ML pipeline on the same dataset. We empirically prove that Sage can: [i] effectively handle out-of-distribution noise power spectral densities, [ii] strongly reject non-Gaussian transient noise artefacts, and [iii] achieve higher detection sensitivities using less data than network architectures of a similar size.

**Abstract**: Performance of multiple filter-cavity schemes for frequency-dependent squeezing in gravitational-wave detectors Jacques Ding, Eleonora Capocasa, Isander Ahrend, Fangfei Liu, Yuhang Zhao, Matteo Barsuglia General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Optics (physics.optics) Gravitational-wave detectors use state-of-the-art quantum technologies to reduce the noise induced by vacuum fluctuations, via injection of squeezed states of light. Future detectors, such as Einstein Telescope, may require the use of two filter cavities or a 3-mirror coupled filter cavity to achieve a complex rotation of the squeezing ellipse, in order to reduce the quantum noise over the whole detector bandwidth. In this work, we compare the theoretical feasibility and performances of these two optical layouts and their resilience with respect to different degradation sources (optical losses, mismatching, locking precision), analytically and numerically. We extend previous analysis on squeezing degradation and find that the coupled cavity scheme provides similar or better performances than the two-cavity option, in terms of resilience with respect to imperfections and optical losses. We further highlight the role of mode-mismatch phases in limiting squeezing. Finally, we propose a possible two-step implementation scheme for Einstein Telescope using a single filter cavity that can be possibly upgraded into a coupled filter cavity.

## 9. The Fast and the Frame-Dragging: Efficient waveforms for asymmetric-mass eccentric equatorial inspirals into rapidly-spinning black holes

Thompson, Soichiro Isoyama, Scott A. Hughes, Niels Warburton, Alvin J. K. Chua, Maxime Pigou 64 pages, 32 figures. See this https URL for the FEW code, and this https URL for a data release accompanying this work. Updated with accepted version General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Observations of gravitational-wave signals emitted by compact binary inspirals provide unique insights into their properties, but their analysis requires accurate and efficient waveform models. Intermediate- and extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (I/EMRIs), with mass ratios $q \gtrsim 10^2$, are promising sources for future detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Modelling waveforms for these asymmetric-mass binaries is challenging, entailing the tracking of many harmonic modes over thousands to millions of cycles. The FastEMRIWaveforms (FEW) modelling framework addresses this need, leveraging precomputation of mode data and interpolation to rapidly compute adiabatic waveforms for eccentric inspirals into zero-spin black holes. In this work, we extend FEW to model eccentric equatorial inspirals into black holes with spin magnitudes $|a| \leq 0.999$. Our model supports eccentricities $e < 0.9$ and semi-latus recta $p < 200$, enabling the generation of long-duration IMRI waveforms, and produces waveforms in $\sim 100$ ms with hardware acceleration. Characterising systematic errors, we estimate that our model attains mismatches of $\sim 10^{-5}$ (for LISA sensitivity) with respect to error-free adiabatic waveforms over most of parameter space. We find that kludge models introduce errors in signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) as great as $^{+60\%}_{-40\%}$ and induce marginal biases of up to $\sim 1\sigma$ in parameter estimation. We show LISA's horizon redshift for I/EMRI signals varies significantly with $a$, reaching a redshift of $3$ ($15$) for EMRIs (IMRIs) with only minor $(\sim10\%)$ dependence on $e$ for an SNR threshold of 20. For signals with SNR $\sim 50$, spin and eccentricity-at-plunge are measured with uncertainties of $\delta a \sim 10^{-7}$ and $\delta e_f \sim 10^{-5}$. This work advances the state-of-the-art in waveform generation for asymmetric-mass binaries.

**Abstract**: Constraining Cubic Curvature Corrections to General Relativity with Quasi-Periodic Oscillations Alireza Allahyari, Liang Ma, Shinji Mukohyama, Yi Pang 16 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in JCAP General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We investigate observational constraints on cubic curvature corrections to general relativity by analyzing quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in accreting black hole systems. In particular, we study Kerr black hole solution corrected by cubic curvature terms parameterized by $\beta_5$ and $\beta_6$. While $\beta_6$ corresponds to a field-redefinition invariant structure, the $\beta_5$ term can in principle be removed via a field redefinition. Nonetheless, since we work in the frame where the accreting matter minimally couples to the metric, $\beta_5$ is in general present. Utilizing the corrected metric, we compute the QPO frequencies within the relativistic precession framework. Using observational data from GRO J1655$-$40 and a Bayesian analysis, we constrain the coupling parameters to $-12.31<\frac{\beta_5}{(5 M_\odot)^4}<24.15$ and $-1.99<\frac{\beta_6}{(5 M_\odot)^4}<0.30$ at 2-$\sigma$. These bounds improve upon existing constraints from big-bang nucleosynthesis and the speed of gravitational waves.

## 11. Quantum Transparency of Near-extremal Black Holes

**Abstract**: Quantum Transparency of Near-extremal Black Holes Roberto Emparan, Stefano Trezzi 22 pages, 8 figures. v2: 23 pages, 8 figures. Small improvements, incl mention of di-quanta absorption, and refined quantum vs semiclassical comparison. v3: added comment. Matches published version High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate the scattering of electromagnetic and gravitational waves off a Reissner-Nordstr√∂m black hole in the low-temperature regime where the near-horizon throat experiences large quantum fluctuations. We find that the black hole is transparent to electromagnetic and gravitational radiation of fixed helicity below a certain frequency threshold. This phenomenon arises because the angular momentum of the black hole is quantized, creating an energy gap between the spinless black hole state and the first excited spinning states. Radiation with angular momentum -- such as photons, gravitons, and partial waves of a massless scalar field, which we also study -- must supply enough energy to bridge this gap to be absorbed. Below this threshold, no absorption can occur, rendering the black hole transparent. For frequencies above the gap, the scarcity of black hole states continues to suppress the absorption cross-section relative to semiclassical predictions, making the black hole translucent rather than completely transparent. Notably, electromagnetic absorption is significantly stronger than gravitational absorption, beyond what differences in spin alone would suggest.

## 12. Gravitational Wave Signatures of Quasi-Periodic Eruptions: LISA Detection Prospects for RX J1301.9+2747

**Abstract**: Gravitational Wave Signatures of Quasi-Periodic Eruptions: LISA Detection Prospects for RX J1301.9+2747 Leif Lui, Alejandro Torres-Orjuela, Rudrani Kar Chowdhury, Lixin Dai 14 pages, 6 figures, submitted to Physical Review Letters High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) One prominent model for quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) is that they originate from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) involving stellar-mass objects orbiting around massive black holes and colliding with their accretion disks. We compute the gravitational wave signals from such a model, demonstrating that orbiter-disk interactions result in small frequency shifts and high-frequency tails due to the excitation of non-discrete modes. Interestingly, we show that QPE RX J1301.9+2747 could be detectable by future space-based gravitational wave detectors, provided a moderate eccentricity around $0.25$ and a mass exceeding $35\,M_\odot$ for the orbiter. Moreover, based on this QPE model, we show that the signal-to-noise ratio of the gravitational wave signals from QPEs, if detectable, will be sufficiently high to distinguish such systems from vacuum EMRIs and shed light on the origin of QPEs and environments around massive black holes.

**Abstract**: Triples as Links between Binary Black Hole Mergers, their Electromagnetic Counterparts, and Galactic Black Holes Smadar Naoz, Zoltan Haiman, Eliot Quataert, Liz Holzknecht 13 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication at ApJ-Lett High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We propose a formation pathway linking black holes (BHs) observed in gravitational-wave (GW) mergers, wide BH-stellar systems uncovered by Gaia, and accreting low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). In this scenario, a stellar-mass BH binary undergoes isolated binary evolution and merges while hosting a distant, dynamically unimportant tertiary stellar companion. The tertiary becomes relevant only after the merger, when the remnant BH receives a GW recoil kick. Depending on the kick velocity and system configuration, the outcome can be: (i) a bright electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to the GW merger; (ii) an LMXB; (iii) a wide BH-stellar companion resembling the Gaia BH population; or (iv) an unbound, isolated BH. Modeling the three-body dynamics, we find that $\sim 0.02\%$ of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) mergers may be followed by an EM counterpart within $\sim$10 days, produced by tidal disruption of the star by the BH. The flare is likely brightest in the optical-UV and lasts days to weeks; in some cases, partial disruption causes recurring flares with a period of $\sim$2 months. We further estimate that this channel can produce $\sim 1-10\%$ of Gaia BH systems in the Milky Way. This scenario provides the first physically motivated link between GW sources, Gaia BHs, and some X-ray binaries, and predicts a rare but robust pathway for EM counterparts to binary BH mergers, potentially detectable in LVK's O5 run.

**Abstract**: CWT-LSTM Autoencoder: A Novel Approach for Gravitational Wave Detection in LIGO Data Jericho Cain Significant gains in training and testing volumes, as well as investigation of missed cases (H1 in maintenance mode, no snr reported because gravitational wave reported only in L1/V1) lead to statistically near perfect separation. Additionally, codebase was redesigned and relocated which will be easier to review Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Gravitational wave detection requires sophisticated signal processing to identify weak astrophysical signals buried in instrumental noise. Traditional matched filtering approaches face computational challenges with diverse signal morphologies and non-stationary noise. This work presents a deep learning methodology integrating Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) preprocessing with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder architecture for gravitational wave detection. The CWT provides optimal time-frequency decomposition capturing chirp evolution and transient characteristics essential for compact binary coalescence identification. We first develop the model using synthetic datasets incorporating binary black hole merger signals with masses ranging from 10 to 80 solar masses. These signals are then embedded in colored Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity. The trained model demonstrates strong performance metrics. We then apply the CWT-LSTM model to gravitational wave data from multiple LIGO observing runs. We use 1639 clean noise samples for training the anomaly detection model, while the test dataset contained a mix of 114 confirmed gravitational wave events and 410 noise samples. The model demonstrates strong performance with an AUC of 1.000 and Average Precision (AP) of 1.000, achieving a precision of 1.0 at the optimal threshold with a recall of 1.0. The reconstruction error distribution shows clear separation between noise and gravitational wave signals, with noise samples clustering around lower reconstruction error values and signals around higher reconstruction error values. This unsupervised approach enables discovery of signals with unknown morphologies that could provide complementary "blind search" capability for detecting exotic astrophysical sources and novel physics beyond current theoretical models.

**Abstract**: Debasish Borah, Nayan Das, Sahabub Jahedi, Dipankar Pradhan 36 pages, 16 captioned figures, improved discussions; accepted for publication in JHEP High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We propose a multi-messenger frontier probe of non-thermal or freeze-in massive particle (FIMP) dark matter (DM) by considering an effective field theory (EFT) setup. Assuming leptophilic operators connecting DM with the standard model (SM) bath, we consider DM mass ($m_{\rm DM}$) and the reheat temperature of the Universe ($T_{\rm rh}$) in a regime which prevents DM-SM thermalisation. Low $T_{\rm rh}$ allows sizeable DM-SM interactions even for non-thermal DM allowing the latter to be probed at direct, indirect detection frontiers as well as future electron-positron and muon colliders. An extended reheating period governed by monomial inflaton potential after its slow-roll phase not only generates the required abundance of non-thermal DM via ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in but also brings the scale-invariant primordial gravitational waves (GW) within reach of near future experiments across a wide range of frequencies. While particle physics experiments can probe $T_{\rm rh} \sim O(10)$ GeV and FIMP DM with mass $m_{\rm DM} \sim O(1)$ TeV, future GW detectors are sensitive to a much wider parameter space.

**Abstract**: Bayesian Gaussian Methods for Robust Background Modeling in CALorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET) Gravitational-Wave Searches Bisweswar Sen 6 Pages, Code Available at this https URL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The search for gamma-ray counterparts to gravitational-wave events with the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) requires accurate and robust background modeling. Previous CALET observing runs (O3 and O4) relied on averaged pre/post-event baselines or low-order polynomial fits, approaches that neglect correlated noise, temporal non-stationarity, and the propagation of background uncertainty into derived flux upper limits. These simplifications can lead to reduced sensitivity to faint or atypical transients. In this work, we present a novel Bayesian framework for background estimation based on Gaussian Process (GP) regression and change-point modeling. Our approach captures correlated structures in the detector background, quantifies predictive uncertainties, and propagates them into both detection statistics and Bayesian credible upper limits. We demonstrate, using archival CALET time-tagged event data and simulated signal injections, that our method improves sensitivity to weak short-duration bursts by up to an order of magnitude compared to traditional polynomial fits. This probabilistic background treatment enables a more physically robust interpretation of non-detections and offers a scalable, real-time compatible extension for future joint multi-messenger searches.

Zarka High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Low-frequency radio data improve the sensitivity of pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) to propagation effects such as dispersion measure (DM) variations, enabling better noise characterization essential for detecting the stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). We combined LOFAR (100-200 MHz) and NenuFAR (30-90 MHz) observations with the recent European and Indian PTA release (DR2new+) into a new dataset, DR2low, spanning ~11 years for 12 pulsars. DR2low allows updated noise models, increasing PTA sensitivity to the GWB. Using Libstempo and Enterprise, we applied standard noise models including red noise (RN) and time-variable DM (DMv) as power laws, and performed Bayesian model selection over RN, DMv, and an additional chromatic noise term (CN4). Compared to DR2new+, DR2low improves DM constraints and separates DM and RN contributions. We found that the RN is required in the final model for 10 out of 12 pulsars, compared to only 5 in the DR2new+ dataset. The improved sensitivity to plasma effects provided by DR2low also favors the identification of significant CN4 in eight pulsars, while none showed such evidence in DR2new+. The analysis also reveals unmodelled solar wind effects, particularly near solar conjunction, with residual delays absorbed into the DM component, highlighting the importance of accurately modelling the solar wind in PTA datasets.

## 18. Recent observations of PKS 2155-304 with MAGIC and LST-1 in a multi-wavelength context

**Abstract**: Recent observations of PKS 2155-304 with MAGIC and LST-1 in a multi-wavelength context Lisa Nikoliƒá, Gaia Verna, Marina Manganaro, Giacomo Bonnoli, Ivan Agudo, Giuseppe Silvestri, Davide Cerasole, Francesco Schiavone, Franjo Podobnik, Jorge Otero-Santos Presented at the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2025), 2025 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) PKS 2155-304 is a well-known high-frequency peaked BL Lac (HBL) at redshift z=0.116, which has been extensively studied across the electromagnetic spectrum due to its rapid and large-amplitude variability. Several violent outbursts in X-rays and $\gamma$-rays have been observed in the past, with intra-night variability in very-high-energy $\gamma$-rays (VHE; E > 100 GeV) detected down to the minute timescale. The alternation of quiescent and enhanced states, observed with a tentative quasi-periodicity of 1.74 $\pm$ 0.13 years in high-energy (HE; 100 MeV < E < 100 GeV) $\gamma$-rays, makes this source a key target also for ground-based $\gamma$-ray instruments and in particular for the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes. Its brightness, proximity, and well-determined redshift make this $\gamma$-ray source a prime target for fundamental physics studies, including tests of Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV), searches for axion-like particles (ALPs), and constraints on the distribution of the extragalactic background light (EBL). In the last two years, PKS 2155-304 has been independently monitored by the Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes and the first Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) located at the Roque de Los Muchachos Observatory (La Palma, Spain). The observations were carried out at large zenith angles (LZA; ZA > 55¬∞), and the VHE data have been complemented with simultaneous observations in HE $\gamma$-rays (Fermi-LAT), X-rays (Swift-XRT) and optical wavelengths (ASAS-SN).

## 19. Formation and growth of intermediate-mass black holes in dense star clusters: Lessons from N-body and MOCCA Monte Carlo Simulations

**Abstract**: Formation and growth of intermediate-mass black holes in dense star clusters: Lessons from N-body and MOCCA Monte Carlo Simulations Abbas Askar, Marcelo C. Vergara, Sohaib Ali 4 pages, 2 figures, 1 table. To appear in the Proceedings of IAU Symposium 398 and MODEST-25: "Compact Objects and Binaries in Dense Stellar Systems" (Seoul, South Korea, June 2025) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Dense star clusters are promising nurseries for the formation and growth of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; $\sim 10^2-10^5\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), with increasing observational evidence pointing to their presence in massive star clusters and stripped dwarf-galaxy nuclei. During the early evolution of compact clusters, massive stars can rapidly segregate to the center, where frequent collisions may trigger the runaway growth of a very massive star (VMS). This object can subsequently collapse to form an IMBH or merge with a stellar-mass black hole. We carried out direct $N$-body and Monte Carlo simulations of star clusters with initial core densities between $10^6$ to $4\times 10^8\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\,\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$ and total masses of $5.9\times 10^5$ and $1.3\times 10^6\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. These models show that IMBHs of $10^3-10^4\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ can form within $\leq 5$ Myr through the runaway collision channel. At later times, the IMBHs continue to grow through mergers with black holes, stars, and compact remnants, providing predictions testable with future gravitational-wave and transient surveys.

**Abstract**: DRAGON-III simulation: modelling million-body globular and nuclear star clusters Kai Wu, Philip Cho, Rainer Spurzem, Long Wang, Francesco Flammini Dotti, Vahid Amiri 4 pages, 1 figure, 1 table. Accepted for publication in IAU Conference proceedings of IAU Symposium 398 & MODEST-25: Compact Objects and Binaries in Dense Stellar Systems Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) As a continuation of DRAGON-II, we present the DRAGON-III project, which focuses on the simulations of million-body globular clusters and nuclear clusters over 10 Gyr. We report on its preliminary results on globular clusters. The first 100 Myr of the simulations have produced 41 pulsars, 191 X-ray binaries, 17 gravitational wave sources, and one black hole-black hole merger due to the loss of orbital energy in the form of gravitational wave emission. The inclusion of initial soft binaries brings surprisingly interesting results, including one IMBH in a binary black hole, and compact object binaries resembling the Gaia-BH1 and the wide black hole-giant binary reported in Wang et al. (2024, Nat. Astro.).

## 21. Study of Lobster and Kirkpatrick-Baez Designs for a Small Mission dedicated to Gravitational Wave Transient Localization

**Abstract**: Study of Lobster and Kirkpatrick-Baez Designs for a Small Mission dedicated to Gravitational Wave Transient Localization John Rankin, Sergio Campana, Giovanni Pareschi, Daniele Spiga, Stefano Basso, Marta Maria Civitani, Paolo Conconi, Vincenzo Cotroneo Proc. SPIE 13626, Optics for EUV, X-Ray, and Gamma-Ray Astronomy XII, 1362611, 2025 Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The localization of X-ray counterparts to gravitational wave events requires a telescope with accurate localization capability in a field of view comparable to the region constrained by the gravitational wave detectors. In the context of a small, dedicated, mission, we investigate which optical design could satisfy this capability. We compare the possible optical designs that have been proposed for X-rays: the Lobster Eye design (both in the Angel and Schmidt variant) - inspired by the eyes of crustaceans - consisting of many small capillaries where grazing incidence reflection occurs, the Kirkpatrick-Baez design, where double reflection occurs on two orthogonal parabolic mirrors, and the standard Wolter-I design. We find that the first two designs, compared to the latter, can achieve a significantly larger field of view, and have a good localization capability if the focal length is longer than existing Lobster Eye designs. The Kirkpatrick-Baez design presents the best angular resolution, but the best overall field of view is obtained with a Lobster system: we present a small optical module able to achieve an effective area $>$100 cm$^2$ at 1 keV in a field of view of 10 deg$^2$.
