**Abstract**: Error quantification and comparison of binary neutron star gravitational waveforms from numerical relativity codes Sarah Habib, Elias R. Most, Nils Deppe, Francois Foucart, Mark A. Scheel, Saul Teukolsky, Michael Boyle, Matthew Duez, Larry Kidder, Jordan Moxon, Kyle C. Nelli, Harald Pfeiffer, William Throwe, Nils Vu General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Future gravitational wave detections of merging binary neutron star systems have the possibility to tightly constrain the equation of state of dense nuclear matter. In order to extract such constraints, gravitational waveform models need to be calibrated to accurate numerical relativity simulations of the late inspiral and merger. In this work, we take an essential step toward classifying the error and potential systematics in current generation numerical relativity simulations of merging binary neutron stars. To this end, we perform a direct comparison of two codes (FIL, SpEC), which differ in many aspects, including the numerical methods and discretizations used and equations solved. We find that despite these different approaches, the codes are -- within current numerical resolution bounds -- fully consistent, and broadly comparable in cost for a given accuracy level. Our results indicate that the error in the waveforms is primarily dominated by the hydrodynamic evolution, consistent with earlier findings in the literature. We also discuss current limitations and cost estimates for numerical relativity simulations to reach the accuracies required in the era of next-generation gravitational wave detectors.

**Abstract**: Gravitational waveforms from periodic orbits around a novel regular black hole Huajie Gong, Sheng Long, Xi-Jing Wang, Zhongwu Xia, Jian-Pin Wu, Qiyuan Pan General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) by LIGO and Virgo has ushered in a new era of strong-field tests of general relativity. We explore potential quantum gravity signatures by studying periodic orbits and their GW emissions around a novel regular black hole featuring a Minkowski core. Using a rational number $q$, periodic orbits are classified, revealing that the deviation parameter $\alpha_0$ reshapes the bound-orbit region while preserving characteristic "zoom-whirl" structures. Numerical kludge waveforms reveal detectable phase shifts and amplitude modulations induced by quantum gravity effects. Faithfulness analysis demonstrates that larger $\alpha_0$ and $q$ enhance distinguishability from the Schwarzschild case, suggesting that large-$q$ periodic orbits in extreme mass ratio inspirals serve as sensitive probes for quantum gravity effects.

## 3. ACT Constraints on Marginally Deformed Starobinsky Inflation

**Abstract**: ACT Constraints on Marginally Deformed Starobinsky Inflation Jureeporn Yuennan, Farruh Atamurotov, Phongpichit Channuie General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate the inflationary phenomenology of a marginally deformed Starobinsky model, motivated by quantum corrections to the $R^{2}$ term, in light of the latest cosmological observations. In this framework, the inflationary potential acquires a small deformation parameter, $\gamma$, which shifts predictions away from the exact Starobinsky limit. Using the slow-roll formalism, we derive analytic expressions for the spectral index $n_{s}$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and confront them with constraints from Planck, ACT, and DESI data. Our analysis shows that nonzero values of $\gamma$ raise both $n_{s}$ and $r$, thereby alleviating the $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ tension between the Starobinsky $R^{2}$ scenario and the ACT+DESI (P-ACT-LB) measurements, which favor $n_{s} \simeq 0.9743 \pm 0.0034$. For $N \sim 60$ $e$-foldings, the model consistently reproduces the observed amplitude of primordial perturbations while predicting tensor contributions within current observational bounds. We also demonstrate that the deformation softens the otherwise severe fine-tuning of the quartic self-coupling in minimally coupled inflation. The parameter range $\gamma \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$-$\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ emerges as phenomenologically viable, providing a natural extension of Starobinsky inflation compatible with present data. We conclude that marginally deformed $R^{2}$ inflation remains a compelling and testable candidate for the primordial dynamics of the Universe, with future CMB and gravitational-wave observations expected to further probe its parameter space.

**Abstract**: Interaction of exact gravitational waves with matter Morteza Mohseni, Saurya Das Phys. Lett. B 870 (2025) 139897 General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We consider interactions of exact (i.e., solutions of full nonlinear field equations) gravitational waves with matter by using the Einstein-Boltzmann equation. For a gravitational wave interacting with a system of massless particles, we compute the perturbed energy-momentum tensor and obtain explicit form of a set of Einstein-Boltzmann equations. We find solution to this system of equations to obtain the gravitational wave profile. The interaction superposes a static term on the gravitational wave profile which depends on the difference between square of the temperatures of the system in the absence and in the presence of the wave. We compute this perturbed term when the states of the system obey Bose-Einstein, Fermi-Dirac, and Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions, respectively. The relative strength of this term is roughly half for the Fermi-Dirac, and one-third for the Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions compared with that of the Bose-Einstein distribution. We consider both Minkowski and flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker backgrounds.

## 5. de Sitter Corrections to Gravitational Wave Memory

**Abstract**: de Sitter Corrections to Gravitational Wave Memory Anthi Voulgari Revof, Shubhanshu Tiwari General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this work, we compute the gravitational wave displacement and spin memory effects in de Sitter spacetime. Gravitational waves in asymptotically flat spacetimes are described by the Bondi-Sachs framework, where radiation at null infinity is tied to the BMS group, and memory appears as permanent changes in the geometry. This formalism becomes more complicated when asymptotic flatness is not guaranteed. With a positive cosmological constant, future infinity is spacelike rather than null, and the decay of the fields differs qualitatively from the flat case. The Bondi-Sachs methods adapted to a positive cosmological constant show that the asymptotic symmetry algebra reduces to time translations and rotations, and that the balance equations for charges and fluxes take a modified form. Our calculation at leading order yields flux-balance relations for displacement and spin memory directly in terms of the cosmological constant Lambda and Bondi-Sachs data. We also find that the cosmological constant mixes spherical-harmonic modes of the memory potentials, producing a (3,0) component in displacement memory and a (2,0) component in spin memory.

## 6. Accounting for Tidal Deformability in Binary Neutron Star Template Banks

**Abstract**: Accounting for Tidal Deformability in Binary Neutron Star Template Banks Lorenzo Piccari, Francesco Pannarale 10 pages, 4 figures. Will be submitted to Physical Review D General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Modelled searches for gravitational waves emitted by compact binary coalescences currently filter the data with template signals that ignore all effects related to the physics of dense-matter in neutron stars interiors, even when the masses in the template are compatible with a binary neutron star or a neutron star-black hole binary source. The leading neutron star finite-size effect is an additional phase contribution due to tidal deformations induced by the gravitational coupling between the two inspiralling objects in the binary. We show how neglecting this effect in the templates reduces the search sensitivity close to the detection threshold. This is particularly true for binary neutron stars systems, where tidal effects are larger. In this work we therefore propose a new technique for the construction of binary neutron star template banks that accounts for neutron star tidal deformabilities as degrees of freedom of the parameter space to be searched over. A first attempt in this direction was carried out by Harry & Lundgren [Physical Review D 104, 043008 (2021)], who proposed to extract randomly the tidal deformabilities of the stars over a uniform interval, regardless of the binary neutron star component masses. We show that this approach yields 33% additional templates with respect to the equivalent point-like template bank. Our proposed approach, instead, adopts a more physically motivated tidal deformability prior with a support that is informed by the value of the neutron star mass and compatible with the neutron star equation of state constraint provided by the observation of GW170817. This method significantly reduces the needed additional templates to 8.2%.

## 7. Gravitational quasinormal modes of Dymnikova black holes

**Abstract**: Gravitational quasinormal modes of Dymnikova black holes Bekir Can L√ºtf√ºoƒülu, Erdin√ß Ula≈ü Saka, Abubakir Shermatov, Inomjon Ibragimov, Javlon Rayimbaev, Sokhibjan Muminov 8 pages, 4 figures, and 4 tables General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate gravitational quasinormal modes of the Dymnikova black hole, a regular spacetime in which the central singularity is replaced by a de Sitter core. This geometry, originally proposed as a phenomenological model, also arises naturally in the framework of Asymptotically Safe gravity, where quantum corrections lead to a scale-dependent modification of the Schwarzschild solution. Focusing on axial gravitational perturbations, we compute the dominant quasinormal frequencies using the WKB method with Pad√© approximants and verify the results with time-domain integration. We find that the introduction of the quantum parameter $l_{\rm cr}$ leads to systematic deviations from the Schwarzschild spectrum: the real oscillation frequency decreases as $l_{\rm cr}$ increases, while the damping rate also becomes smaller, implying longer-lived modes. In the limit of large $l_{\rm cr}$, the quasinormal spectrum smoothly approaches the Schwarzschild case. These results suggest that even though the corrections are localized near the horizon, they leave imprints in the gravitational-wave ringdown which may become accessible to observation with future high-precision detectors.

We also provide a compact expression to estimate the amount of scalar-induced gravitational waves generated by peaks.

## 9. Constraints on quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder black holes with eccentric extreme mass-ratio inspirals

**Abstract**: Constraints on quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder black holes with eccentric extreme mass-ratio inspirals Sen Yang, Yu-Peng Zhang, Li Zhao, Yu-Xiao Liu General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate the potential of extreme mass-ratio inspirals to constrain quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder black holes within the framework of loop quantum gravity. We consider a stellar-mass object orbiting a supermassive Oppenheimer-Snyder black hole in an equatorial eccentric trajectory. To explore the dynamical behavior of the system, we analyze its orbital evolution under gravitational radiation within the adiabatic approximation and the mass-quadrupole formula for different initial orbital configurations. Our results show that the quantum correction parameter $\hat{\alpha}$ slows down the evolution of the orbital semi-latus rectum and eccentricity. We then employ the numerical kludge method to generate the corresponding time-domain gravitational waveforms. To assess detectability, we include Doppler modulation due to the motion of space-based detectors and compute the frequency-domain characteristic strain. By evaluating mismatches between response signals for different values of $\hat{\alpha}$, we show that even small corrections $(\hat{\alpha} \sim 10^{-5})$ produce distinguishable effects. Our analysis suggests that future space-based detectors such as LISA can probe quantum gravitational corrections in the strong-field regime and place constraints significantly stronger than those from black hole shadow observations.

**Abstract**: Quasinormal spectra of higher dimensional regular black holes in theories with infinite curvature corrections Juan Pablo Arbelaez General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate the quasinormal modes of several families of higher-dimensional regular black holes arising in gravitational theories that incorporate an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections to Einstein gravity. Our analysis focuses on how the ringdown phase of gravitational waves for such regular black holes deviates from the predictions of General Relativity. We employ the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method to calculate the quasinormal modes and to derive compact analytic expressions in the eikonal approximation. Our results contribute to understanding how possible quantum-gravity-motivated corrections and regularity conditions can manifest in gravitational-wave signals.

## 11. CHRONOS: Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter

**Abstract**: CHRONOS: Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter Yuki Inoue, Hsiang-Chieh Hsu, Hsiang-Yu Huang, M.Afif Ismail, Vivek Kumar, Miftahul Ma'arif, Avani Patel, Daiki Tanabe, Henry Tsz-King Wong, Da-Chun Yu Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det) We propose a next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detector, the Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS), optimized for the unexplored 0.1-10Hz band bridging the gap between the space-based LISA and future ground-based detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. CHRONOS combines a ring-cavity Sagnac interferometer with torsion-bar test masses to realize the first quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of angular momentum in a macroscopic system. By implementing a speed-meter readout in the rotational degree of freedom, CHRONOS coherently cancels quantum radiation-pressure noise and enables sub-Hz observations. We show that detuned power recycling and cavity-length optimization can simultaneously relax technical requirements on both torsion bars and speed meters. Assuming a realistic optical design with a 1m torsion bar, we estimate strain sensitivities of $h \simeq 1 \times 10^{-18}\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1Hz for detectors with arm lengths of 2.5m, 40m, and 300m. These sensitivities enable (i) direct detection of intermediate-mass black hole binaries up to 380Mpc with ${\rm SNR}=3$, (ii) probing stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds down to $\Omega_{\rm GW} \sim 3.2 \times 10^{-9}$ at 0.2Hz with 5yr accumulation. Furthermore, CHRONOS enables prompt detection of gravity-gradient signals from magnitude-5.5 earthquakes even with a 2.5m prototype. CHRONOS thus opens new opportunities for quantum-limited geophysical observation and multi-band, multi-messenger gravitational-wave astronomy.

## 12. Aligned Hierarchical Black Hole Mergers in AGN disks revealed by GWTC-4

**Abstract**: Aligned Hierarchical Black Hole Mergers in AGN disks revealed by GWTC-4 Yin-Jie Li, Yuan-Zhu Wang, Shao-Peng Tang, Yi-Zhong Fan 10 pages, 8 figures, comments are welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The active galactic nucleus (AGN) accretion disks are ideal sites for hierarchical black hole (BH) mergers. To robustly probe such a possibility, we analyze binary black hole mergers in the GWTC-4 with a flexible mixture population model for component masses, spin magnitudes, and spin tilt angles, and identify two distinct subpopulations. In the second subpopulation characterized by high spin magnitudes $\chi\sim 0.8$ as well as the broad mass distribution up to $\gtrsim 150M_\odot$, we find a pronounced preference for spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum: an isotropic tilt distribution is strongly disfavored (logarithmic Bayes factor = 4.5). The aligned events account for $\sim 0.57^{+0.23}_{-0.31}$ of the second subpopulation, corresponding to a local rate of $\sim 0.25^{+0.38}_{-0.16} ~ {\rm Gpc}^{-3} {\rm yr}^{-1}$ (all values reflect central 90\% credible intervals). These notable features naturally arise from hierarchical mergers embedded in AGN disks, where gas torques can effectively align spins. Our results identify AGN-disk hierarchical assembly as an important channel in the present gravitational-wave sample and provide concrete, testable predictions for future detection.

**Abstract**: Parallel Nested Slice Sampling for Gravitational Wave Parameter Estimation David Yallup, Metha Prathaban, James Alvey, Will Handley To be submitted to SciPost Physics Proceedings (EuCAIFCon 2025) Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Inferring parameters and testing hypotheses from gravitational wave signals is a computationally intensive task central to modern astrophysics. Nested sampling, a Bayesian inference technique, has become an established standard for this in the field. However, most common implementations lack the ability to fully utilize modern hardware acceleration. In this work, we demonstrate that when nested sampling is reformulated in a natively vectorized form and run on modern GPU hardware, we can perform inference in a fraction of the time of legacy nested sampling implementations whilst preserving the accuracy and robustness of the method. This scalable, GPU-accelerated approach significantly advances nested sampling for future large-scale gravitational-wave analyses.

## 14. Unified laboratory-frame analysis of atomic gravitational-wave sensors

**Abstract**: Unified laboratory-frame analysis of atomic gravitational-wave sensors Simon Schaffrath, Daniel St√∂rk, Fabio Di Pumpo, Enno Giese Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph) Atomic sensors using light-matter interactions, in particular atomic clocks and atom interferometers, have the potential to complement optical gravitational-wave detectors in the mid-frequency regime. Although both rely on interference, the interfering components of clocks are spatially colocated, whereas atom interferometers are based on spatial superpositions. Both the electromagnetic fields that drive the transitions and generate superpositions, while propagating through spacetime, as well as the atoms themselves as massive particles are influenced by gravitational waves, leading to effective potentials that induce phase differences inferred by the sensor. In this work, we analyze the effects of these potentials on atomic clocks and atom interferometers in the laboratory frame. We show that spatial superpositions in atom interferometers, both light-pulse and guided ones, give rise to a gravitational-wave signal. Although these spatial superpositions are suppressed for clocks, we show that the light pulses driving internal transitions measure the spatial distance between the centers of two separate clocks. We highlight that this mechanism only yields a sensitivity if both clocks, including possible trapping setups, move on geodesics given by the gravitational wave. While such configurations are natural for satellite free-fliers, terrestrial optical clocks normally rely on stationary traps, rendering them insensitive to leading order. Moreover, we show that both sensors can be enhanced by composite interrogation protocols in a common framework. To this end, we propose a pulse sequence that can be used for large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers and for hyper-echo atomic clocks, leading to a signal enhancement and noise suppression.

## 15. Gravitational waves from axion inflation in the gradient expansion formalism II: Fermionic axion inflation

**Abstract**: Gravitational waves from axion inflation in the gradient expansion formalism II: Fermionic axion inflation Richard von Eckardstein, Kai Schmitz, Oleksandr Sobol Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Axion inflation represents an intriguing source of gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. In a companion paper arXiv:2508.00798, we previously leveraged the gradient expansion formalism (GEF) to investigate pure axion inflation (PAI), i.e., axion inflaton coupled to a pure gauge sector. In this paper, we extend our analysis to fermionic axion inflation (FAI), i.e., we allow for the presence of fermions in the gauge sector. PAI predicts a strongly blue-tilted GW spectrum; in our GEF benchmark study, all parameter regions leading to observable GWs turned out to violate the upper limit on the number of extra relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. As we demonstrate in this paper, the situation is different for FAI: Schwinger pair creation of the charged fermions results in a damping of the gauge-field production, which attenuates the GW signal. As a result, the GW signal from FAI can fall into the sensitivity reach of LISA and ET without violating the upper limit on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. This result notably applies to the arguably most realistic variant of Abelian axion inflation, in which the axion couples to the hypercharge sector of the Standard Model. Besides, we discuss GW emission from the fermion gas, which may further enhance the total GW signal but which also requires a more quantitative investigation in future work. Additionally, we identify a new backreaction regime in which fermion production moderates the axion--vector dynamics. In this regime, the axion velocity and all energy-density components exhibit oscillations analogous to the strong backreaction in PAI, but here, the oscillations occur around the slow-roll trajectory and are damped by the presence of charged fermions. These observations define again an interesting GEF benchmark for future lattice studies.

## 16. Extended mass distribution of PBHs during QCD phase transition: SGWB and mini-EMRIs

**Abstract**: Extended mass distribution of PBHs during QCD phase transition: SGWB and mini-EMRIs Nilanjandev Bhaumik, Huai-Ke Guo, Si-Jiang Liu Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Primordial black holes (PBHs) are one of the most important tracers of cosmic history. In this work, we investigate the formation of PBHs around the time of the QCD phase transition from a broadly peaked inflationary scalar power spectrum, which naturally produces an extended PBH mass function. This scenario yields two distinct stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB): (i) scalar-induced, second-order tensor perturbations generated at PBH formation, and (ii) a merger-driven SGWB from the subsequent PBH binary population. Using Bayesian analysis, we examine both SGWB channels with the data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the first three observing runs of LVK. We also forecast continuous-wave signals from mini extreme mass ratio inspirals (mini-EMRIs) for direct comparison with NANOGrav and LVK constraints. Our parameter scans identify regions of the parameter space where the combined SGWB is detectable in future ground-based and space-based detectors. A broad PBH mass distribution naturally gives rise to mini-EMRIs, which future ground-based observatories, such as LVK A+, ET, and CE, can detect. For a large part of the PBH parameter space, the SGWB of astrophysical origin masks the primordial SGWB in the frequency band of ground-based detectors. Thus, for extended PBH mass distributions, we find that the detection of mini-EMRIs is a more robust channel for probing the PBH parameter space than the corresponding SGWB.

**Abstract**: Resonant Locking Between Binary Systems Induced by Gravitational Waves Charlie Sharpe, Yonadav Barry Ginat, Zeyuan Xuan, Bence Kocsis General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The interaction of gravitational waves (GWs) with matter is thought to be typically negligible in the Universe. We identify an exception in the case of resonant interactions, where GWs emitted by a background binary system, such as an inspiraling supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary, cause a resonant response in a stellar-mass foreground binary and the frequencies of the two systems become, and remain, synchronized. We point out that this previously unexplored dynamical phenomenon is not only possible, but can lead to $\mathcal{O}(30)$ binary systems becoming resonantly locked in the host galaxy of merging SMBHs of mass $10^{8.5-11}\Msun$, each of which has a significantly reduced merger time. We predict $\mathcal{O}(10^{10})$ binary systems have been locked in the Universe's history. Resonant locking could be detected through anomalous inspiral of binary systems.

**Abstract**: Tidal dissipation in binary neutron star inspirals from hyperon bulk viscosity: Phase modeling and parameter estimation bias Suprovo Ghosh, Samanwaya Mukherjee, Sukanta Bose, Debarati Chatterjee 10 pages, 8 figures, matches accepted version in MNRAS General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) During the inspiral of a binary neutron star, viscous processes in the neutron star matter can damp out the tidal energy induced by its companion and convert it to thermal energy. This tidal dissipation/heating process introduces a net phase shift in the gravitational wave signal. In our recent work, we showed based on a Newtonian estimate that tidal dissipation from bulk viscosity originating from the non-leptonic weak interactions involving hyperons could have a detectable phase shift in the gravitational-wave (GW) signal in the next-generation GW detectors. Using simulated signals, we demonstrate that not accounting for this physical effect in waveform models can result in systematic biases in tidal deformability measurements of high-mass neutron star ($\geq 1.8M_{\odot}$) binary observations in next-generation GW detectors. By employing Newtonian orbital dynamics, we model this tidal dissipation induced dephasing as a phenomenological function of the characteristic velocity. We incorporate its effect in gravitational waveforms of equal-mass binary neutron stars. Those waveforms are used to perform a full Bayesian parameter estimation, which confirms that our model can alleviate possible biases in tidal deformability estimation. We also illustrate that the model can accurately measure the additional phase due to tidal dissipation in a $2M_{\odot}$ neutron star in observations with next-generation GW detectors and discuss its significance in extreme matter studies.

**Abstract**: Leveraging cross-detector parameter consistency measures to enhance sensitivities of gravitational wave searches Sayantan Ghosh, Leigh Smith, Jiyoon Sun, Archana Pai, Ik Siong Heng, V. Gayathri General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) All-sky searches for generic short-duration astrophysical GW transients are often challenging because of noise transients. Developing novel signal-noise discriminators is crucial for GW transient searches with LIGO Scientific, Virgo, and KAGRA (LVK) detectors. In this work, we adapt a recently developed Jensen Shannon divergence (JSD)-based measure, which assesses the cross-detector parameter consistency to distinguish between weakly modeled or unmodelled astrophysical GW signals and loud noise triggers. We first extend a 2-detector JSD-based measure, developed in an earlier work, to a 3-detector network. We leverage this to modify the test statistic of the existing Coherent Waveburst (cWB)-Gaussian Mixture Modelling (GMM) algorithm for short-duration transients towards improving the search sensitivity to ad-hoc waveforms like Sine-Gaussians, Gaussian Pulses, and White Noise Bursts. We find that with the new method, which we term cWB-GMM-JSD, the sensitivity to the ad-hoc waveforms, given by $h_{\mathrm{rss50}}$, improves by $\sim 10-20 \%$ at an IFAR of 10 years for the 2-detector network consisting of LHO and LLO detectors, and by $\sim 5-10 \%$ at the same IFAR for the 3-detector network consisting of LHO, LLO and Virgo detectors. Finally, we apply the modified statistic in the revised data analysis pipeline on the publicly available data from the third observing run (O3) of the LIGO and Virgo detectors. Although we do not find any new event in the O3 data, we see a notable rise in the statistical significance of most of the known GW events, which further testifies to the enhancement in sensitivities.

Multiple search algorithms exist to detect the signals from compact binary coalescences, but their varying performance complicates interpretation. We present a machine learning-driven approach that combines results from individual pipelines and utilises conformal prediction to provide robust, calibrated uncertainty quantification. Using simulations, we demonstrate improved detection efficiency and apply our model to GWTC-3, enhancing confidence in multi-pipeline detections, such as the sub-threshold binary neutron star candidate GW200311_103121.

Conforms with the version published in Phys. Rev. D General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Asymptotically Weyl-invariant gravity (AWIG) is further developed within the Palatini formalism as a power-counting renormalizable alternative to general relativity (GR). An expression for the dimensionless exponent n(R) is derived based on dynamical dimensional reduction. We show that this version of AWIG naturally resolves several theoretical issues normally associated with the Palatini formalism. A falsifiable prediction regarding the frequency of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers is made. A preliminary analysis of gravitational wave GW150914 yields a maximum tension of 0.9{\sigma} with GR and marginally favours AWIG. A similar analysis of gravitational wave GW151226 yields a maximum tension of 2.7{\sigma} with GR and favours AWIG more significantly.

Scheel Md Arif Shaikh et al 2025 Class. Quantum Grav. 42 195012 General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Standardizing the definition of eccentricity is necessary for unambiguous inference of the orbital eccentricity of compact binaries from gravitational wave observations. In previous works, we proposed a definition of eccentricity for systems without spin-precession that relies solely on the gravitational waveform, is applicable to any waveform model, and has the correct Newtonian limit. In this work, we extend this definition to spin-precessing systems. This simple yet effective extension relies on first transforming the waveform from the inertial frame to the coprecessing frame, and then adopting an amplitude and a phase with reduced spin-induced effects. Our method includes a robust procedure for filtering out spin-induced modulations, which become non-negligible in the small eccentricity and large spin-precession regime. Finally, we apply our method to a set of Numerical Relativity and Effective One Body waveforms to showcase its robustness for generic eccentric spin-precessing binaries. We make our method public via Python implementation in \texttt{gw\_eccentricity}.

**Abstract**: Constraining the nonstandard propagating gravitational waves in the cosmological background with GWTC-3 Zu-Cheng Chen, Lang Liu 10 pages, 2 figures, version accepted for publication in Sci. China Phys. Mech. Astron. (SCPMA) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has opened a new window to test the fundamental nature of gravity. We present constraints on the nonstandard propagation of GWs using the spectral siren method applied to binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). The spectral siren method exploits the redshift distribution of BBHs to probe the cosmic expansion history and break degeneracies between cosmology and modified gravity effects. We focus on the friction term $\nu$ in the nonstandard GW propagation equation, which characterizes the running of the Planck mass. Assuming the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we find $\nu = 0.5^{+3.5}_{-2.6}$ (median and $90\%$ credible interval), improving upon previous constraints from the bright siren event GW170817 by an order of magnitude. This improvement is due to the higher redshifts of BBHs in GWTC-3, reaching up to $z \sim 1$. Our result suggests that the propagation of GWs is consistent with the predictions of general relativity, placing limits on modified gravity theories that predict a time-varying Planck mass. As the sensitivity of GW detectors improves, the spectral siren method will provide a powerful tool for testing gravity on cosmological scales and probing the physics of the early Universe.

**Abstract**: Gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae with no electromagnetic counterparts Jade Powell, Bernhard M√ºller Accepted in Classical and Quantum Gravity focus issue Gravitational Wave Physics and Astrophysics Ten Years After GW150914 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are regularly observed electromagnetically, prompting targetted searches for their gravitational-wave emission. However, there are scenarios where these powerful explosions may not have any observable electromagnetic signal, but would still have strong detectable emission in gravitational waves and neutrinos. A regular CCSN explosion may be obscured by matter in the Galaxy. A star may undergo a failed CCSN explosion, where the stalled shockwave is not revived, and would eventually form a black hole. Higher mass progenitor stars may revive the shock, but form a black hole too quickly for the shockwave to reach the surface of the star and produce an electromagnetic signal. Previous work has shown that we can determine if a black hole forms from the CCSN neutrino emission if there are long duration sinusoidal modulations in the neutrino signal caused by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI). The SASI also produces an observable signature in the gravitational-wave emission. In this paper, we investigate if we can distinguish between different scenarios for electromagnetically dark CCSNe using the gravitational-wave emission alone. We find, using a reconstruction of the SASI mode, abrupt end times of the gravitational-wave emission, and the rate of change of frequency of the dominant mode, that we are able to accurately distinguish between an obscured CCSN, a failed CCSN, and an explosion with fast black hole formation.

**Abstract**: Thermal Gravitons from Warm Inflation Gabriele Montefalcone, Barmak Shams Es Haghi, Tao Xu, Katherine Freese 13 pages, 4 figures, v2: minor changes, matches published version Phys. Rev. D 112 (2025), 063556 High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In warm inflation (WI), the persistent thermal bath that is sustained by dissipative interactions with the inflaton field produces a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper we study the production and evolution of these GWs. Specifically, we investigate the emission of thermal gravitons (gravitons emitted by a thermal bath) from particle scattering in the bath and the evolution of the corresponding GWs. We find that the bulk of thermal graviton production in WI occurs during the transition to radiation domination after inflation. Further, the energy density of thermal gravitons is enhanced by roughly one to two orders of magnitude compared to that in a radiation-dominated scenario with the same reheating temperature. We also calculate the spectrum of the resulting stochastic GW background and find that it has a distinctive shape, consisting of a peak at high frequencies ~100 GHz and an almost flat spectrum extending to low frequencies. The peak arises from emission of sub-horizon modes that follow the temperature of the bath. The flat part of the spectrum corresponds to the modes that exit the horizon during WI and re-enter during radiation domination. We show that the detection prospects for the high-frequency peak of the GW spectrum, while improved slightly compared to the radiation-dominated case, still remain challenging. The thermal spectrum's low-frequency plateau is typically subdominant to the amplitude of the standard vacuum tensor modes from inflation, although WI models can exist where the thermal graviton plateau surpasses the vacuum contribution without exceeding current observational limits on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. Furthermore, we calculate the thermal graviton contribution from WI to dark radiation and show that WI models are generally expected to satisfy current observational bounds, including those from the cosmic microwave background.

**Abstract**: Error signals for overcoming the laser power limits of gravitational-wave detectors Liu Tao, Pooyan Goodarzi, Jonathan W. Richardson Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) A major barrier to improving the quantum-limited sensitivity of gravitational-wave observatories is the thermal distortions of the test masses which arise at megawatt laser power. Recent advances in a new form of higher-order wavefront correction, in which corrective heating profiles are applied to the test mass surfaces near their edges, together with other planned instrumental upgrades, have the potential to enable a tenfold reduction of the quantum noise floor of future detectors. However, realizing high levels of quantum noise reduction in practice hinges on identifying measurable error signals to finely control each wavefront actuator, in order to suppress wavefront errors to a few-nanometer precision across the full mirror apertures. No direct source of such an error signal exists in LIGO today. We demonstrate that thermally imaging the surface of each test mass can provide these critical error signals. We show that the surface temperature profiles obtained from thermal imaging can be uniquely mapped to a finite element model of the mirror whose complete thermal state is identified, enabling full-aperture wavefront reconstruction and direct error signals for real-time precision wavefront control. This new sensing capability can enable up to a 34% strain sensitivity improvement in LIGO A+ at 95% confidence, increasing the sky-averaged detection range for binary neutron star mergers by 11 Mpc, and will be integral to a next-generation 40-km gravitational-wave observatory in the U.S., Cosmic Explorer.

That has been fixed in this replacement, and a typo in the paper corrected (just punctuation) Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Gravitational wave detection requires sophisticated signal processing to identify weak astrophysical signals buried in instrumental noise. Traditional matched filtering approaches face computational challenges with diverse signal morphologies and non-stationary noise. This work presents a deep learning methodology integrating Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) preprocessing with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder architecture for gravitational wave detection. The CWT provides optimal time-frequency decomposition capturing chirp evolution and transient characteristics essential for compact binary coalescence identification. We first develop the model using synthetic datasets incorporating binary black hole merger signals with masses ranging from 10 to 80 solar masses. These signals are then embedded in colored Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity. The trained model demonstrates strong performance metrics. We then apply the CWT-LSTM model to gravitational wave data from multiple LIGO observing runs. We use 418 clean noise samples for training the anomaly detection model, while the test dataset contained a mix of 24 confirmed gravitational wave events and 161 noise samples. The model demonstrates strong performance with an AUC of 0.979 and Average Precision (AP) of 0.932, achieving a precision of 1.0 at the optimal threshold with a recall of 0.83. The reconstruction error distribution shows clear separation between noise and gravitational wave signals, with noise samples clustering around 0.45 and signals around 0.65. This unsupervised approach enables discovery of signals with unknown morphologies that could provide complementary "blind search" capability for detecting exotic astrophysical sources and novel physics beyond current theoretical models.

Comments are welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an); Computation (stat.CO) The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) reveals valuable information about its origin and the Universe. The pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are suitable indicators for detecting SGWB within the nano-Hertz frequency range. In this work, we propose a graph-based method implemented on the pulsar timing residuals (PTRs) for SGWB detection and examining uncertainties of its parameters. We construct a correlation graph with pulsars as its nodes, and analyze the graph-based summary statistics, which include topological and geometrical characteristics, for identifying SGWB in real and synthetic datasets. The effect of the number of pulsars, the observation time span, and the strength of the SGWB on the graph-based feature vector is evaluated. Our results demonstrate that the merit feature vector for common signal detection consists of the average clustering coefficient and the edge weight fluctuation. The SGWB detection conducted after the observation of a common signal and then exclusion of non-Hellings \& Downs templates is performed by the second cumulant of edge weight for angular separation thresholds $\bar{\zeta}\gtrsim 40^{\circ}$. The lowest detectable value of SGWB strain amplitude utilizing our graph-based measures at the current PTAs sensitivity is $A_{\rm SGWB}\gtrsim 1.2\times 10^{-15}$. Fisher forecasts confirmed that the uncertainty levels of $\log_{10} A_{\rm SGWB}$ and spectral index reach $2.2\%$ and $28.3\%$, respectively, at $2\sigma$ confidence interval. Evidence for an SGWB at the $3\sigma$ level is obtained by applying our graph-based method to the NANOGrav 15-year dataset.

**Abstract**: Constraining the environment of compact binary mergers with self-lensing signatures Helena Ubach, Mark Gieles, Jordi Miralda-Escud√© Accepted for publication in PRD. Comments welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Gravitational waves (GWs) from coalescing binary black holes (BBHs) can come from different environments. GWs interact gravitationally with astrophysical objects, which makes it possible to use gravitational lensing by objects in the same gravitational system (self-lensing) to learn about their environments. We quantify the probability of self-lensing through the optical depth $\tau$ for the main channels of detectable GWs at frequencies $f_{\rm GW}\sim (1-10^3)\,{\rm Hz}$. We then analyze the detectability of the lensing effect (imprint). In star clusters, the probability of self-lensing by stellar-mass black holes (BHs) is low, $\tau\simeq10^{-7}$, even when taking into account nearby BHs in resonant interactions, $\tau\simeq 10^{-5}$. Additionally, the lensing imprint of a stellar-mass lens (diffraction and interference) is too marginal to be detectable by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors and most Einstein Telescope signals. For a massive BH lens in the center of a cluster, the probability can reach $\tau\simeq 10^{-4}$ either via von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai induced mergers of BBHs orbiting a central massive BH, or BBHs formed as GW captures in single-single interactions in the Bahcall-Wolf cusp of a nuclear cluster. For self-lensing by a supermassive BH for BBHs in the migration trap of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk, $\tau \simeq 10^{-2}$. The imprint of these massive lenses are multiple images that are already detectable. Moreover, self-lensed signals from AGN disks have a distinct linear polarization. The probability depends on the extent of the detectability through the threshold impact parameter $y_{\rm max}$, which can increase for future detectors. We conclude that constraining the environment of BBHs is possible by combining self-lensing imprints with other waveform signatures such as eccentricity and polarization.

Wilson-Hodge, Joshua Wood High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Gamma-ray bursts are the most luminous electromagnetic events in the universe. Their prompt gamma-ray emission has typical durations between a fraction of a second and several minutes. A rare subset of these events have durations in excess of a thousand seconds, referred to as ultra-long gamma-ray bursts. Here, we report the discovery of the longest gamma-ray burst ever seen with a ~25,000 s gamma-ray duration, GRB 250702B, and characterize this event using data from four instruments in the InterPlanetary Network and the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image. We find a hard spectrum, subsecond variability, and high total energy, which are only known to arise from ultrarelativistic jets powered by a rapidly-spinning stellar-mass central engine. These properties and the extreme duration are together incompatible with all confirmed gamma-ray burst progenitors and nearly all models in the literature. This burst is naturally explained with the helium merger model, where a field binary ends when a black hole falls into a stripped star and proceeds to consume and explode it from within. Under this paradigm, GRB 250702B adds to the growing evidence that helium stars expand and that some ultra-long GRBs have similar evolutionary pathways as collapsars, stellar-mass gravitational wave sources, and potentially rare types of supernovae.

**Abstract**: New ab initio constrained extended Skyrme equations of state for simulations of neutron stars, supernovae and binary mergers: II. Thermal response in the suprasaturation density domain Adriana R. Raduta, Mikhail V. Beznogov Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae, mergers of binary neutron stars and formation of stellar black holes, which employed standard Skyrme interactions, established clear correlations between the evolution of these processes, characteristics of the hot compact objects, as well as neutrino and gravitational wave signals, and the value of effective nucleon mass at the saturation density. Unfortunately, the density dependence of the effective mass of nucleons in these models does not align with the predictions of ab initio models with three body forces. In this work, we investigate the thermal response for a set of extended Skyrme interactions that feature widely different density dependencies of the effective mass of the nucleons. Thermal contributions to the energy density and pressure are studied along with a few thermal coefficients over wide domains of density, temperature and isospin asymmetry, relevant for the physics of hot compact objects. For some of the effective interactions, the thermal pressure is negative at high densities. This results in a situation where hot compact stars can support less mass before collapsing into a black hole compared to their cold counterparts. Moreover, the higher the temperature, the lower the maximum mass that the hot star can support.

**Abstract**: Black hole dragging: a new mechanism for forming nuclear star clusters in giant elliptical galaxies Nader Khonji, Alessia Gualandris, Justin I. Read, Walter Dehnen 21 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) It has long been thought that nuclear star clusters (NSCs) cannot co-exist with the most massive supermassive black holes (SMBHs), since SMBH mergers - unavoidable for the most massive systems - would scatter away NSC stars. However, central concentrations of light have now been reported in up to a third of all massive ellipticals. We present a new mechanism for forming NSCs in giant elliptical galaxies, arising naturally from SMBH mergers, which could explain these observations. We call this ''black hole dragging''. After a major merger of two galaxies and their SMBHs, the newly-merged SMBH can receive a gravitational wave recoil kick. We show that recoiling SMBHs induce two competing effects on the galaxy's background stars. Firstly, some stars become bound to the SMBH and co-move with it, an effect strongest at low recoil velocities. Secondly, background stars are ejected as the recoiling SMBH falls back due to dynamical friction, an effect strongest at high recoil velocities. At intermediate recoil velocities (500-1000 km/s), both effects become important, and the density of bound stars can exceed that of the background stellar core. This yields a central dense NSC that is clearly visible in the galaxy's surface brightness profile. We show that NSCs formed in this way have realistic sizes, masses and velocity dispersions when measured similarly to observed systems. This provides a route for even giant ellipticals containing SMBHs to host an NSC. We predict such NSCs should have indistinguishable colors, ages and chemistry from non-NSC central stars, combined with low ellipticities.

**Abstract**: Blink and you'll miss it - How Technological Acceleration Shrinks SETI's Narrow Detection Window Michael Garrett (University of Manchester, JBCA and Leiden University) 15 pages, 2 figures, accepted by Acta Astronautica Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Popular Physics (physics.pop-ph) The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) has historically focused on detecting electromagnetic technosignatures, implicitly assuming that alien civilisations are biological and technologically analogous to ourselves. This paper challenges that paradigm, arguing that highly advanced, potentially post-biological civilisations may undergo rapid technological acceleration, quickly progressing beyond recognisable or detectable phases. We introduce a simple model showing that the technological acceleration rate of such civilisations can compress their detectable phase to mere decades, dramatically narrowing the temporal "detection window" in which their technosignatures overlap with our current capabilities. This framework offers a plausible resolution to the "Great Silence": advanced civilisations may be abundant and long-lived, but effectively invisible to present-day SETI methods. Consequently, our efforts must include but also evolve beyond the search for narrow-band communication signals in the radio and optical domains. Instead, we require an expanded, technology-agnostic strategy focused on persistent, large-scale manifestations of intelligence, such as broadband electromagnetic leakage, waste heat from megastructures, and multi-dimensional anomaly detection across extensive, multi-wavelength and multi-messenger datasets. Leveraging advanced artificial intelligence for unsupervised anomaly discovery, recursive algorithm optimisation, and predictive modelling will be essential to uncover the subtle, non-anthropocentric traces of advanced civilisations whose technosignatures lie beyond our current technological and cognitive frameworks.

Yokozawa Rev. Sci. Instrum. 94, 074502 (2023) Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det) The Kamioka Gravitational wave detector (KAGRA) cryogenic gravitational-wave observatory has commenced joint observations with the worldwide gravitational wave detector network. Precise calibration of the detector response is essential for accurately estimating parameters of gravitational wave sources. A photon calibrator is a crucial calibration tool used in laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory, Virgo, and KAGRA, and it was utilized in joint observation 3 with GEO600 in Germany in April 2020. In this paper, KAGRA implemented three key enhancements: a high-power laser, a power stabilization system, and remote beam position control. KAGRA employs a 20 W laser divided into two beams that are injected onto the mirror surface. By utilizing a high-power laser, the response of the detector at kHz frequencies can be calibrated. To independently control the power of each laser beam, an optical follower servo was installed for power stabilization. The optical path of the photon calibrator beam positions was controlled using pico-motors, allowing for the characterization of the detector rotation response. Additionally, a telephoto camera and quadrant photodetectors were installed to monitor beam positions, and beam position control was implemented to optimize the mirror response. In this paper, we discuss the statistical errors associated with the measurement of relative power noise. We also address systematic errors related to the power calibration model of the photon calibrator and the simulation of elastic deformation effects using finite element analysis. Ultimately, we have successfully reduced the total systematic error from the photon calibrator to 2.0 /%.
