**Abstract**: On the uncertainty in predicting the stochastic gravitational wave background from compact binary coalescences Michael Ebersold, Tania Regimbau General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The stochastic gravitational-wave background from compact binary coalescences is expected to be the first detectable stochastic signal via cross-correlation searches with terrestrial detectors. It encodes the cumulative merger history of stellar-mass binaries across cosmic time, offering a unique probe of the high-redshift Universe. However, predicting the background spectrum is challenging due to numerous modeling choices, each with distinct uncertainties. In this work, we present a comprehensive forecast of the astrophysical gravitational-wave background from binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and neutron star-black hole systems. We systematically assess the impact of uncertainties in population properties, waveform features, and the modeling of the merger rate evolution. By combining all uncertainties, we derive credible bands for the background spectrum, spanning approximately an order of magnitude in the fractional energy density. These results provide thorough predictions to facilitate the interpretation of current upper limits and future detections.

**Abstract**: Expectations for the first supermassive black-hole binary resolved by PTAs II: Milestones for binary characterization Polina Petrov, Levi Schult, Stephen R. Taylor, Nihan Pol, Nima Laal, Maria Charisi, Chung-Pei Ma Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Following the recent evidence for a gravitational wave (GW) background found by pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments, the next major science milestone is resolving individual supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The detection of these systems could arise via searches using a power-based GW anisotropy model or a deterministic template model. In Schult et al. 2025, we compared the efficacy of these models in constraining the GW signal from a single SMBHB using realistic, near-future PTA datasets, and found that the full-signal deterministic continuous wave (CW) search may achieve detection and characterization first. Here, we continue our analyses using only the CW model given its better performance, focusing now on characterization milestones. We examine the order in which CW parameters are constrained as PTA data are accumulated and the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) grows. We also study how these parameter constraints vary across sources of different sky locations and GW frequencies. We find that the GW frequency and strain are generally constrained at the same time (or S/N), closely followed by the sky location, and later the chirp mass (if the source is highly evolving) and inclination angle. At fixed S/N, sources at higher frequencies generally achieve better precision on the GW frequency, chirp mass, and sky location. The time (and S/N) at which the signal becomes constrained is dependent on the sky location and frequency of the source, with the effects of pulsar terms and PTA geometry playing crucial roles in source detection and localization.

## 3. Dedicated-frequency analysis of gravitational-wave bursts from core-collapse supernovae with minimal assumptions

**Abstract**: Dedicated-frequency analysis of gravitational-wave bursts from core-collapse supernovae with minimal assumptions Yi Shuen C. Lee, Marek J Szczepa≈Ñczyk, Tanmaya Mishra, Margaret Millhouse, Andrew Melatos 19 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in Physical Review D High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Gravitational-wave (GW) emissions from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) provide insights into the internal processes leading up to their explosions. Theory predicts that CCSN explosions are driven by hydrodynamical instabilities like the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) or neutrino-driven convection, and simulations show that these mechanisms emit GWs at low frequencies ($\lesssim 0.25 \,{\rm kHz}$). Thus the detection of low-frequency GWs, or lack thereof, is useful for constraining explosion mechanisms in CCSNe. This paper introduces the dedicated-frequency framework, which is designed to follow-up GW burst detections using bandpass analyses. The primary aim is to study whether low-frequency (LF) follow-up analyses, limited to $\leq 256 \,{\rm Hz}$, constrain CCSN explosion models in practical observing scenarios. The analysis dataset comprises waveforms from five CCSN models with different strengths of low-frequency GW emissions induced by SASI and/or neutrino-driven convection, injected into the Advanced LIGO data from the Third Observing Run (O3). Eligible candidates for the LF follow-up must satisfy a benchmark detection significance and are identified using the coherent WaveBurst (cWB) algorithm. The LF follow-up analyses are performed using the BayesWave algorithm. Both cWB and BayesWave make minimal assumptions about the signal's morphology. The results suggest that the successful detection of a CCSN in the LF follow-up analysis constrains its explosion mechanism. The dedicated-frequency framework also has other applications. As a demonstration, the loudest trigger from the SN 2019fcn supernova search is followed-up using a high-frequency (HF) analysis, limited to $\geq 256 \,{\rm Hz}$. The trigger has negligible power below $256 \, {\rm Hz}$, and the HF analysis successfully enhances its detection significance.

**Abstract**: Multimessenger consistency relations bridging gravitational wave and large scale structure observations Antonio Enea Romano Added the derivation of general consistency condition, added more details about observational constraints General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We show that for Horndeski theories it is possible to derive mathematically compact consistency relations (CR) between physically observable quantities, valid for different classes of theories defined by the behavior of the brading function $\alpha_B$, independent of all other property functions. The CRs establish a parametrization independent direct relation between the effective gravitational constant, the slip parameter, the gravitational and electromagnetic waves (EMW) luminosity distances, the speed of gravitational waves (GW) and the sound speed. The no-brading CR is also satisfied by general relativity (GR), and allows to estimate the gravitational coupling from GWs observations, independently from large scale structure (LSS) observations. A general, less mathematically compact, consistency condition is also derived, valid for any form of the function $\alpha_B$ and the other property functions. We apply the CRs to map the large scale structure observational constraints on the effective gravitational constant and the slip parameter to GW-EMW distance ratio constraints, showing that LSS and GWs give independent constraints consistent with no-brading. Beside allowing to perform parametrization and model independent tests of the consistency between different constraints on modified gravity, the CRs allow to probe the value of the effective gravitational constant with multimessenger observations, independently from LSS observations.

**Abstract**: Stability Analysis of Cosmological Perturbations in the Bumblebee Model: Parameter Constraints and Gravitational Waves Xiao-Bin Lai, Yu-Qi Dong, Yu-Zhi Fan, Yu-Xiao Liu General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We constrain the parameter space of the Bumblebee model within a cosmological background and investigate the properties of gravitational waves under the constrained parameter space. Specifically, we derive the conditions for the absence of ghost instability, Laplacian instability, and tachyonic instability for perturbations in a cosmological background. By incorporating the observed accelerated expansion of the universe and the observational constraints on tensor gravitational waves, we derive bounds on the parameter space of the Bumblebee model. We then examine the polarization modes, the propagation speeds, and the amplitude relations of gravitational waves within this constrained framework. Our results indicate that the non-minimal coupling parameter $\xi$ must be non-positive, and the Lorentz-violating parameter $\xi b^2$ has a lower bound on the order of $10^{-15}$. The propagation modes of gravitational waves in the Bumblebee model consist of two tensor modes, two vector modes, and a combination of two scalar modes. Notably, the tensor modes travel at subluminal speeds, whereas the vector and scalar modes propagate at superluminal speeds. These results provide a concrete theoretical framework and specific observational signatures for testing Lorentz invariance in the gravitational sector with future gravitational-wave detectors.

**Abstract**: Eccentric binary black holes: A new framework for numerical relativity waveform surrogates Peter James Nee, Adhrit Ravichandran, Scott E. Field, Tousif Islam, Harald P. Pfeiffer, Vijay Varma, Michael Boyle, Andrea Ceja, Noora Ghadiri, Lawrence E. Kidder, Prayush Kumar, Akash Maurya, Marlo Morales, Antoni Ramos-Buades, Abhishek Ravishankar, Katie Rink, Hannes R. R√ºter, Mark A. Scheel, Md Arif Shaikh, Daniel Tellez 11 pages, 5 figures; updated references General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Mounting evidence indicates that some of the gravitational wave signals observed by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observatories might arise from eccentric compact object binaries, increasing the urgency for accurate waveform models for such systems. While for non-eccentric binaries, surrogate models are efficient and accurate, the additional features due to eccentricity have posed a challenge. In this letter, we present a novel method for decomposing eccentric numerical relativity waveforms which makes them amenable to surrogate modelling techniques. We parameterize the inspiral in the radial phase domain, factoring out eccentricity-induced dephasing and thus enhancing compressibility and accuracy. This is combined with a second surrogate for the merger-ringdown in the time-domain and a novel technique to take advantage of the approximate periodicity with radial oscillations during the inspiral. We apply this procedure to the $(2,2)$ mode for non-spinning black hole binaries, and demonstrate that the resulting surrogate, NRSurE_q4NoSpin_22, is able to faithfully reproduce the underlying numerical relativity waveforms, with maximum mismatches of $5\times10^{-4}$ and median mismatches of $2\times10^{-5}$. This technique paves the way for high-accuracy parameter estimation with eccentric models, a key ingredient for astrophysical inference and tests of general relativity.

**Abstract**: Chase Orbits, not Time: A Scalable Paradigm for Long-Duration Eccentric Gravitational-Wave Surrogates Akash Maurya, Prayush Kumar, Scott E. Field, Chandra Kant Mishra, Peter James Nee, Kaushik Paul, Harald P. Pfeiffer, Adhrit Ravichandran, Vijay Varma 12 pages, 7 figures, 1 table; updated references General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph) Surrogate modeling of eccentric binary black hole waveforms has remained challenging. The complicated morphology of these waveforms due to the eccentric orbital timescale variations makes it difficult to construct accurate and efficient surrogate models, especially for waveforms long enough to cover the sensitivity band of the current ground-based gravitational wave detectors. We present a novel and scalable surrogate building technique which makes surrogate modeling of long-duration eccentric binary black hole waveforms both feasible and highly efficient. The technique aims to simplify the harmonic content of the intermediate eccentric surrogate data pieces by modeling them in terms of an angular orbital element called the mean anomaly, instead of time. We show that this novel parameterization yields an order of magnitude fewer surrogate basis functions than using the contemporary parameterization in terms of time. We show that variations in surrogate data-pieces across parameter space become much more regular when expressed in terms of the instantaneous waveform eccentricity and mean anomaly, greatly easing their parameter-space fitting. The methods presented in this work make it feasible to build long-duration eccentric surrogates for the current as well as future third-generation gravitational wave detectors.

**Abstract**: Inflationary Gravitational Wave Spectral Shapes as test for Low-Scale Leptogenesis Zafri A. Borboruah, Anish Ghoshal, Lekhika Malhotra, Urjit Yajnik 59 pages including references, 14 captioned figures, modified version, matches the one accepted in PRD High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We study non-thermal resonant leptogenesis in a general setting where a heavy majoron $\phi$ decays to right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) whose further out-of-equilibrium decay generates the required lepton asymmetry. Domination of the energy budget of the Universe by the $\phi$ or the RHNs alters the evolution history of the primordial gravitational waves (PGW) of inflationary origin, which re-enter the horizon after inflation, modifying the spectral shape. The decays of $\phi$ and RHNs release entropy into the early Universe while nearly degenerate RHNs facilitate low and intermediate-scale leptogenesis. A characteristic damping of the GW spectrum resulting in knee-like features would provide evidence for low-scale non-thermal leptogenesis. We explore the parameter space for the lightest right-handed neutrino mass $M_1\in[10^2,10^{14}]$ GeV and washout parameter $K$ that depends on the light-heavy neutrino Yukawa couplings $\lambda$, in the weak ($K < 1$) and strong ($K > 1$) washout regimes. The resulting novel features compatible with observed baryon asymmetry are detectable by future experiments like LISA and ET. By estimating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for upcoming GW experiments, we investigate the effect of the majoron mass $M_\phi$ and reheating temperature $T_\phi$, which depends on the $\phi-N$ Yukawa couplings $y_N$.

**Abstract**: Can asteroid-mass PBHDM be compatible with catalyzed phase transition interpretation of PTA? Jiahang Zhong, Chao Chen, Yi-Fu Cai 27 pages,7 figures; comments are welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Primordial black holes (PBHs) can catalyze first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in their vicinity, potentially modifying the gravitational wave (GW) signals from PTs. In this study, we investigate the GWs from strong PTs catalyzed by PBHs. We consider high PBH number densities, corresponding to asteroid-mass PBH dark matter (DM) when the GWs from FOPTs peak in the nanohertz band. We calculate the PBH-catalyzed FOPT GWs from both bubble collision GWs and scaler-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). We find that while low PBH number densities amplify the GW signals due to the formation of large bubbles, high PBH number densities suppress them, as the accelerated phase transition proceeds too rapidly. This suppression renders the signals unable to explain pulsar timing array (PTA) observations. By conducting data fitting with the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, we find that the PBH catalytic effect significantly alters the estimation of PT parameters. Notably, our analysis of the bubble collision GWs reveals that, the asteroid-mass PBHs ($10^{-16} - 10^{-12} M_\odot$) as the whole dark matter is incompatible with the PT interpretation of pulsar timing array signals. However, incorporating SIGWs can reduce this incompatibility for PBHs in the mass range $10^{-14} - 10^{-12} M_\odot$.

**Abstract**: Strong-lensing rates of massive black hole binaries in LISA Juan Guti√©rrez, Macarena Lagos Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Similarly to electromagnetic (EM) signals, gravitational lensing by intervening galaxies can also affect gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper, we estimate the strong-lensing rate of massive black hole mergers observed with LISA. Given the uncertainties in the source populations as well as in the population of galaxies at high redshift, we consider: six different source population models, including light and heavy seeds, as well as three lens population models, including redshift-independent and redshift-dependent evolution properties. Among all the scenarios explored, the expected number of strong lensed events detected in a 4-year observation time in LISA ranges between 0.13-231 with most of them having two (one) images detectable in the heavy (light) seed scenarios. The event numbers obtained correspond to 0.2%-0.9% of all detected unlensed events. Out of all the detectable strong-lensed events, up to 61% (in the light-seed scenario) and 1% (in the heavy-seed scenario) of them are above the detectability threshold solely due to strong lensing effects and would otherwise be undetectable. For detectable pairs of strong-lensed events by galaxy lenses, we also find between 72%-81% of them to have time delays from 1 week to 1 year.

**Abstract**: Scalar-induced gravitational waves including isocurvature perturbations with lattice simulations Xiang-Xi Zeng Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) open a unique window into early-universe physics. While their generation from adiabatic perturbations has been extensively studied, the contribution from isocurvature perturbations remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a lattice simulation framework to compute the stochastic gravitational wave background from both pure isocurvature and mixed initial conditions. Our numerical results show excellent agreement with semi-analytical predictions in the pure isocurvature case. We further analyze multi-peak structures under general initial conditions and find that they closely match those produced in purely adiabatic scenarios. Additionally, we examine SIGWs in early matter-dominated eras, revealing that the peak amplitude and spectral slope are sensitive to the microphysical properties of the dominant field, such as the primordial black hole mass, abundance, or soliton decay rate. This study establishes lattice simulations as a robust tool for predicting SIGW spectra from complex primordial perturbations, with important implications for interpreting current and future gravitational wave observations.

**Abstract**: Updating GUT-Scale Pole Higgs Inflation After ACT C. Pallis High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We consider models of chaotic inflation driven by the real parts of a conjugate pair of Higgs superfields involved in the spontaneous breaking of a grand unification symmetry at a scale assuming its value within MSSM. We combine a superpotential, which is uniquely determined by applying a continuous R symmetry, with two fractional shift-symmetric Kaehler potentials introducing two free parameters (p,N). The inflationary observables provide an excellent match to the recent ACT data for 1.355<=p<=6.7 and 6x10^-5<= N<=0.7. The attainment of inflation allows for subplanckian inflaton values and possibly detectable primordial gravitational waves with (p,N) values of order unity. A solution to the mu problem of MSSM and baryogenesis via non-thermal leptogenesis can be also accommodated extending the superpotential of the model with suitable terms.

## 13. Constraining the Neutron-Star Equation of State via Short Gamma-Ray Burst X-ray Afterglows

**Abstract**: Constraining the Neutron-Star Equation of State via Short Gamma-Ray Burst X-ray Afterglows R. Moradi, Y. Wang, F. Rastegarnia, E. S. Yorgancioglu, Shu-Xu Yi, B. Eslam Panah, S. N. Zhang Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal (ApJ) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Recent observations from NICER in X-rays and LIGO/Virgo in gravitational waves have provided critical constraints on the mass, radius, and tidal deformability of neutron stars, imposing stringent limits on the equation of state (EOS) and the behavior of ultra-dense matter. However, several key parameters influencing the EOS, such as the maximum mass of neutron stars, spin-down rates, and the potential role of exotic matter in their cores, remain subject of ongoing debate. Here we present a new approach to constraining the EOS by analyzing the X-ray afterglows of some short gamma-ray bursts, focusing on "the internal plateau" phase and its abrupt decay, which reflect the spin-down and possible collapse of a supra-massive neutron star into a black hole. By linking critical neutron star masses with black hole formation criteria and the observational data from Swift's BAT and XRT instruments with compact object models, we explore three representative EOSs that range from "soft" to "stiff". Our result supports a maximum mass for neutron stars of approximately 2.39 solar masses at the threshold of black hole formation. This conclusion holds under assumptions of magnetar-powered X-ray plateaus, constant radiative efficiency, isotropic emission, and full Kerr black hole energy extraction; deviations could influence the inferred results. Our results demonstrate the critical role of neutron star/black hole physics in probing dense nuclear matter and provide a novel framework for exploring extreme astrophysical environments.

Blandford, Anna Synani, Philipe V. de la Parra, No√©mie Globus, Mitchell C. Begelman, Anthony C.S. Readhead 13 pages, 8 figures, submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) Supermassive black hole binary systems (SMBHBs) are thought to emit the recently discovered nHz gravitational wave background; however, not a single individual nHz source has been confirmed to date. Long-term radio-monitoring at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory has revealed two potential SMBHB candidates: blazars PKS 2131-021 and PKS J0805-0111. These sources show periodic flux density variations across the electromagnetic spectrum, signaling the presence of a good clock. To explain the emission, we propose a generalizable jet model, where a mildly relativistic wind creates an outward-moving helical channel, along which the ultra-relativistic jet propagates. The observed flux variation from the jet is mostly due to aberration. The emission at lower frequency arises at larger radius and its variation is consequently delayed, as observed. Our model reproduces the main observable features of both sources and can be applied to other sources as they are discovered. We make predictions for radio polarization, direct imaging, and emission line variation, which can be tested with forthcoming observations. Our results motivate future numerical simulations of jetted SMBHB systems and have implications for the fueling, structure, and evolution of blazar jets.

**Abstract**: Expectations for the first supermassive black-hole binary resolved by PTAs I: Model efficacy Levi Schult, Polina Petrov, Stephen R. Taylor, Nihan Pol, Nima Laal, Maria Charisi, Chung-Pei Ma 25 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables. Submitted to Physical Review D Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) One of the most promising targets for Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) is identifying an individual supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) out of the population of binaries theorized to produce a gravitational wave background (GWB). In this work, we emulate an evolving PTA dataset, complete with an increasing number of pulsars and timing baseline, into which we inject a single binary on top of a Gaussian GWB signal. We vary the binary's source parameters, including sky position and frequency, and create an ensemble of simulated datasets with which we assess current Bayesian binary search techniques. We apply two waveform-based template models and a frequency-resolved anisotropy search to these simulations to understand how they compare in their detection and characterization abilities. We find that a template-based search including the full gravitational-wave signal structure (i.e., both Earth and pulsar effects of an incident GW) returns the highest Bayes Factors (BF), exceeding our estimator's capabilities by (S/N)~9-19, and has the most robust parameter estimation. Our anisotropy model attains a realization-median BF>10 at 7<(S/N)<15. Interestingly, despite being a deterministic model, the Earth-term template struggles to detect and characterize low-frequency binaries (5 nHz). These binaries require higher (S/N)~16-19 to reach the same BF threshold. This is likely due to neglected confusion effects between the pulsar and Earth terms. By contrast, the frequency-resolved anisotropy model shows promise for parameter estimation despite treating a binary's GW signal as excess directional GW power without phase modeling. Sky location and frequency parameter constraints returned by the anisotropy model are only surpassed by the Earth term template model at (S/N)~12-13. Milestones for a first detection using the full-signal GW model are included in a companion paper (Petrov et al. 2025).

**Abstract**: What Determines the Maximum Mass of AGN-assisted Black Hole Mergers? LingQin Xue, Hiromichi Tagawa, Zoltan Haiman, Imre Bartos Phys. Rev. D (2025) 112, 063034 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The origin of merging binary black holes detected through gravitational waves remains a fundamental question in astrophysics. While stellar evolution imposes an upper mass limit of about 50 solar mass for black holes, some observed mergers--most notably GW190521--involve significantly more massive components, suggesting alternative formation channels. Here we investigate the maximum masses attainable by black hole mergers within active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks. Using a comprehensive semi-analytic model incorporating 27 binary and environmental parameters, we explore the role of AGN disk conditions in shaping the upper end of the black hole mass spectrum. We find that AGN disk lifetime is the dominant factor, with high-mass mergers (>200 solar mass) only possible if disks persist for ~40 Myr. The joint electromagnetic observation of an AGN-assisted merger could therefore lead to a direct measurement of the age of an AGN disk.

**Abstract**: Multiphase gas offsets in the atmospheres of central galaxies and their consequences for SMBH activation I. The hot and warm ionized gas phases Francesco Ubertosi, Fabrizio Brighenti, Ewan O'Sullivan, Gerrit Schellenberger, Myriam Gitti, Simona Giacintucci, Pasquale Temi, Laurence P. David, Jan Vrtilek, Tiziana Venturi, Elisabetta Liuzzo, Marcella Massardi, Kamlesh Rajpurohit Under review in The Astrophysical Journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate the spatial relationships between multi-phase gas components and supermassive black hole (SMBH) activity in a sample of 25 cool core galaxy groups and clusters. Using high angular resolution observations from \textit{Chandra}, VLT/MUSE, and VLBA, we robustly locate the position, respectively, of the X-ray peak of the intracluster medium (ICM), of the H$\alpha$ peak of the warm ionized gas, and of the SMBH radio core on parsec scales. We identify spatial offsets between the X-ray peak of the hot gas and the SMBH in 80% of the systems, with an average displacement of $\langle\Delta^{\text{SMBH}}_{\text{X-ray}}\rangle = 4.8$ kpc (dispersion of $3.8$ kpc). In contrast, the peak of warm ionized gas traced by H$\alpha$ exhibits much smaller offsets ($\langle\Delta^{\text{SMBH}}_{\text{H}\alpha}\rangle = 0.6$ kpc; dispersion of $1.4$ kpc) and a lower incidence of displacement (15%). Our findings suggest that hot gas sloshing primarily drives the observed spatial offsets, with AGN-driven uplift contributing in some this http URL, systems with H$\alpha$ - SMBH offsets of $\geq$1 kpc uniformly lack detectable radio cores on VLBA scales, with upper limits on the 5~GHz power of $P_{5\,\text{GHz}} \leq 10^{21-22}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, while those without such offsets exhibit radio powerful AGN with pc-scale radio emission up to $P_{5\,\text{GHz}} \sim 10^{24-25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. This correlation indicates that centrally concentrated warm gas is critical for sustaining radio-loud SMBH activity, possibly supporting scenarios of cold-mode accretion. Overall, our results highlight the importance of high-angular-resolution, multi-wavelength observations for understanding the interplay between multiphase gas cooling and AGN fueling in central galaxies.
