**Abstract**: Spin-aligned inspiral waveforms from self-force and post-Newtonian theory Lo√Øc Honet, Josh Mathews, Geoffrey Comp√®re, Adam Pound, Barry Wardell, Gabriel Andres Piovano, Maarten van de Meent, Niels Warburton 5 pages + references + 3 pages supplementary material ; 4 figures, 1 table General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present the state-of-the-art waveform model WaSABI-C for quasicircular inspirals of spinning black hole binaries with aligned or anti-aligned spins. Our model synthesizes the most up-to-date first- and second-order gravitational self-force results with high-order post-Newtonian expansions through a systematic hybridization procedure. This approach captures both strong-field and weak-field dynamics with high fidelity, enabling accurate modeling of spin-(anti)aligned inspirals across a wide parameter space. The resulting waveforms mark a significant advance in the precision of self-force-based templates, providing critical input for the detection and interpretation of gravitational waves from compact binaries with future observatories such as LISA and ET. We accompany this work with the release of WaSABI (Waveform Simulations of Asymmetric Binary Inspirals), a public package implementing our model for community use and further development.

**Abstract**: Globally defined Carroll symmetry of gravitational waves Mahmut Elbistan, Peng-Ming Zhang, Peter Horvathy General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph) The locally defined Carroll symmetry of a gravitational wave is extended to a globally defined one. Translations and Carroll boosts, associated with two independent globally defined solutions of a Sturm-Liouville equation allow us to describe the motions. The Displacement Memory Effect arises for particular choices of the parameters which yield trajectories with zero momentum. We illustrate our general statements by the P√∂schl-Teller profile.

## 3. Contamination of transient gravitational waves in LISA data by gaps and glitches

**Abstract**: Contamination of transient gravitational waves in LISA data by gaps and glitches Jonathan R. Gair, Senwen Deng, Stanislav Babak General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We present a probabilistic framework to quantify the impact of artefacts (glitches and gaps) in LISA data on transient gravitational wave signals. By modeling both artefacts and transient signals as independent Poisson processes, and characterising the contaminating effect of an artefact by an associated dead time, we estimate the probability distribution of the total contamination time during the observation period using a Normal approximation under various contamination scenarios. Using the same approach, we also estimate the probability that a population of transient signals contaminates each other. We demonstrate the validity of the Normal approximation by comparing it to the numerical distribution obtained via simulations. Our approach provides a rapid means to assess the potential impact of glitches and gaps on LISA science, and can be used as a figure of merit to evaluate different instrumental scenarios.

## 4. Contribution from Nonlinear Quasi-normal Modes in GW250114

**Abstract**: Contribution from Nonlinear Quasi-normal Modes in GW250114 Yuxin Yang, Changfu Shi, Yi-Ming Hu General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We report evidence for nonlinear gravitational effects in the ringdown signal of gravitational wave event GW250114. Using Bayesian inference, we find that the inclusion of a nonlinear quasi-normal mode (220Q), a second-order harmonic predicted by general relativity, is statistically favored over the standard linear model (440 mode) when analyzing the post-merger oscillations. Specifically, models incorporating the 220Q mode yield higher Bayes factors than those including only the linear 440 mode, and produce remnant black hole parameters (mass and spin) more consistent with full numerical relativity simulations. This suggests that nonlinear mode coupling contributes significantly to the ringdown phase, opening a new avenue to probe strong-field gravity beyond linear approximations.

## 5. Gertsenshtein effect on the spacetime curved by background magnetic field with geometric optics

**Abstract**: Gertsenshtein effect on the spacetime curved by background magnetic field with geometric optics Ryutaro Tomomatsu, Teruaki Suyama, Paolo Gondolo General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) When electromagnetic (or gravitational) waves propagate in the presence of a background magnetic field, a portion of the waves converts into gravitational (or electromagnetic) waves. This phenomenon, known as the (inverse) Gertsenshtein effect, is typically analyzed in Minkowski spacetime, neglecting the spacetime curvature induced by the magnetic field itself. This paper investigates, for the first time, the influence of spacetime curvature on the (inverse) Gertsenshtein effect. To this end, we first determine the metric perturbation from Minkowski spacetime up to second order in the magnetic field strength, assuming cylindrical symmetry. We also discuss the ambiguities in the form of the metric perturbation arising from gauge freedom and boundary conditions. Using the geometric optics approximation, we then derive a set of coupled equations governing the propagation of electromagnetic and gravitational waves in the resulting curved spacetime. These equations are solved for two specific scenarios: a plane wave and a spherical wave. From the solutions, we compute the evolution of the wave amplitudes and the associated energy fluxes. Our analysis reveals that two competing effects govern the amplitude evolution: magnification due to the focusing of waves by spacetime curvature, and attenuation due to wave conversion via the Gertsenshtein effect. In the plane wave case, these effects precisely cancel, resulting in no net change in amplitude. In contrast, for the spherical wave, the Gertsenshtein effect dominates over focusing, leading to an overall reduction in amplitude.

## 6. From Stars to Waves: Non-deterministic Inference of Microlensed Gravitational Waves

**Abstract**: From Stars to Waves: Non-deterministic Inference of Microlensed Gravitational Waves Zhaoqi Su, Xikai Shan, Zhenwei Lyu, Junyao Zhang, Yebin Liu, Shude Mao, Huan Yang 19 pages, 11 figures, comments are welcome! General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Strongly lensed gravitational waves may pass through the stellar field of a lensing galaxy with additional modulations (on both phase and amplitude) due to gravitational microlensing effect of stars/remnants near the line of sight. These microlensed waveforms depend on the mass and location of thousands or more most relevant stars, so that their deterministic reconstruction from the data is computationally prohibitive. We classify the detection and parameter estimation of such events as non-deterministic inference problem and propose a solution with the implementation of normalizing flows. As a first step, we show that $8\%$ of microlensed events can be detected with significance $\ge 3 \sigma$ in the third generation era, with the chosen microlensing parameters correlated with the density of the underlying stellar field. This approach opens the door to probing microlensing effects and the properties of the underlying stellar fields. A similar construction may also be applied to other non-deterministic inference problems, such as detecting post-merger gravitational waves from binary neutron star coalescence and signals from core-collapse supernovae.

## 7. Hierarchical modeling of gravitational-wave populations for disentangling environmental and modified-gravity effects

**Abstract**: Hierarchical modeling of gravitational-wave populations for disentangling environmental and modified-gravity effects Shubham Kejriwal, Enrico Barausse, Alvin J. K. Chua General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect up to thousands of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). These sources will spend $\sim 10^5$ cycles in band, and are therefore sensitive to tiny changes in the general-relativistic dynamics, potentially induced by astrophysical environments or modifications of general relativity (GR). Previous studies have shown that these effects can be highly degenerate for a single source. However, it may be possible to distinguish between them at the population level, because environmental effects should impact only a fraction of the sources, while modifications of GR would affect all. We therefore introduce a population-based hierarchical framework to disentangle the two hypotheses. Using simulated EMRI populations, we perform tests of the null vacuum-GR hypothesis and two alternative beyond-vacuum-GR hypotheses, namely migration torques (environmental effects) and time-varying $G$ (modified gravity). We find that with as few as $\approx 20$ detected sources, our framework can statistically distinguish between these three hypotheses, and even indicate if both environmental and modified gravity effects are simultaneously present in the population. Our framework can be applied to other models of beyond-vacuum-GR effects available in the literature.

## 8. Observable spins in gravitational waves from compact binary mergers

**Abstract**: Observable spins in gravitational waves from compact binary mergers Souradeep Pal General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We investigate the measurability of effective inspiral spin in the detectable compact binary mergers using gravitational-wave observations. Measurements from the latest gravitational-wave transient catalog do not rule out the existence of binary systems with non-zero effective spins. However, we observe an apparent correlation between the inferred effective inspiral spin and the loudness of the gravitational-wave events-- loud events typically have close-to-zero effective spins whereas fainter events tend to be inferred with relatively arbitrary effective spins. Through simulations, we demonstrate that non-negligible effective spins can be systematically inferred from non-spinning systems at small signal strengths. These two observations support the possibility that the effective spin magnitudes in the observable compact binaries are generally small. Future detections can have potential impact on the understanding of their population and other astrophysical inferences.

**Abstract**: Robustness Analysis and Controller Design of Arm-locking System in Space-based Gravitational Wave Detectors Yongbin Shao, Xinyi Zhao, Long Ma, Ming Xin General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Arm-locking frequency stabilization is a key technique for suppressing laser frequency noise in space-based gravitational-wave detectors. The robustness of the arm-locking control loop is crucial for maintaining laser frequency stability, which directly impacts the accuracy of gravitational-wave measurements. In this work, a parametric stability analysis framework is developed by combining the D-subdivision theory with the Semi-Discretization method to map the stability regions of arm-locking systems in the parameter space and identify their critical stability boundaries. Based on the frequency-domain characteristics, a robust arm-locking controller is designed to enhance loop stability under parameter perturbations. Theoretical analysis and time-domain simulations confirm that the proposed controller maintains closed-loop stability and realize suppression of laser frequency noise against parameter perturbation.

Barker Main paper: 11 pages and 4 figures; Total with appendices: 39 pages and 12 figures General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex) The angular distribution of gravitational-wave power from persistent sources may exhibit anisotropies arising from the large-scale structure of the Universe. This motivates directional searches for astrophysical and cosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds, as well as continuous-wave emitters. We present results of such a search using data from the first observing run through the first portion of the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations. We apply gravitational-wave radiometer techniques to generate skymaps and search for both narrowband and broadband persistent gravitational-wave sources. Additionally, we use spherical harmonic decomposition to probe spatially extended sources. No evidence of persistent gravitational-wave signals is found, and we set the most stringent constraints to date on such emissions. For narrowband point sources, our sensitivity estimate to effective strain amplitude lies in the range $(0.03 - 8.4) \times 10^{-24}$ across all sky and frequency range $(20 - 160)$ Hz. For targeted sources -- Scorpius X-1, SN 1987A, the Galactic Center, Terzan 5, and NGC 6397 -- we constrain the strain amplitude with best limits ranging from $\sim 1.1 \times 10^{-25}$ to $6.5 \times 10^{-24}$. For persistent broadband sources, we constrain the gravitational-wave flux $F_{\alpha, \hat{n}}^{95\%, \mathrm{UL}}(25\, \mathrm{Hz}) < (0.008 - 5.5) \times 10^{-8}\, \mathrm{erg\, cm^{-2}\, s^{-1}\, Hz^{-1}}$, depending on the sky direction $\hat{n}$ and spectral index $\alpha=0,\,2/3,\,3$. Finally, for extended sources, we place upper limits on the strain angular power spectrum $C_\ell^{1/2} < (0.63 - 17) \times 10^{-10} \,\mathrm{sr}^{-1}$.

## 11. Tilt-to-length noise subtraction with pointing jitters from closed-loop dynamics for TianQin

**Abstract**: Tilt-to-length noise subtraction with pointing jitters from closed-loop dynamics for TianQin Yuzhou Fang, Dexuan Zhang, Dezhi Wang, Xuefeng Zhang, Huizong Duan, Hongyin Li, Junxiang Lian, Guoying Zhao General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det) TianQin is a proposed space-based mission for gravitational wave detection, employing a constellation of three drag-free satellites in high Earth orbits to form a laser interferometric observatory. A critical technical challenge is mitigating tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling noise, which is expected to be the third dominant noise source after laser frequency and clock noises. This noise is unavoidable in the presence of the residual angular movement of satellites, movable optical subassemblies (MOSAs), and test masses (TMs), and needs to be subtracted after reducing the first two types of noises using time-delay interferometry (TDI). Previous works have shown that TTL coupling coefficients can be estimated from the null TDI channel $\zeta$ and used for noise subtraction in other combinations. However, it was found that correlated MOSA yaw jitters have a negative impact on the TTL calibration, and the effects of realistic residual angular jitters from drag-free and pointing control (DFPC) are yet to be investigated. In this paper, we use closed-loop DFPC simulations to generate more realistic jitters in the science mode and test TTL calibration capability. Our simulations reveal that rotating only one MOSA is more favorable, compared to symmetrically rotating two MOSAs, for enhancing the accuracy of TTL coefficient estimation, while employing only high-frequency data (0.1 - 1 Hz). Moreover, we propose two other methods to further improve estimation accuracy. Firstly, using different null channel combinations, such as $C_3^{14}$, enhances the least squares estimation accuracy even in the case of high correlations in MOSAs' yaw jitters. Secondly, injecting different sinusoidal artificial maneuvers to the six MOSAs also shows improvements. These methods can help TianQin to meet the 0.3 pm/Hz$^{1/2}$ requirement after the TTL noise subtraction.

## 12. Black hole ringdown tests of gravity

**Abstract**: Black hole ringdown tests of gravity Sergi Sirera 181 pages + appendices and references, 35 figures General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Understanding gravity is at the heart of some of the biggest questions in modern physics. While General Relativity (GR) is a theoretically unique and experimentally well-tested framework, it remains important to question whether it accurately describes gravity at all scales, motivating the exploration of broader theories. Black holes (BHs) provide ideal natural laboratories for testing gravity in the strong-field regime, and the recent advent of gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has opened a new observational window into these extreme environments. In particular, the final stage of a compact binary merger$\unicode{x2013}$the ringdown phase$\unicode{x2013}$is of great interest. Here, the study of quasinormal modes (QNMs) offers a powerful tool to probe the fundamental nature of gravity and to extract intrinsic properties of BHs. This thesis investigates BH solutions and their QNM spectra within scalar-tensor theories of gravity$\unicode{x2013}$well-motivated extensions of GR that include an additional scalar degree of freedom. In particular, it focuses on stealth BHs, where scalar hair exists without altering the background metric but can modify the QNM spectrum. By analysing perturbations around such spacetimes, we derive forecasted constraints on beyond-GR parameters for current and future GW detectors. Three main investigations are presented: (i) a novel method to constrain the speed of gravity using ringdown signals alone; (ii) a stability and QNM analysis of BHs with linearly time-dependent scalar hair; and (iii) a general classification of stealth solutions in higher-order scalar-tensor (HOST) theories, including a stability analysis and identification of ringdown observational signatures. Together, these studies contribute new theoretical tools and observational forecasts that advance our understanding on fundamental gravitational physics in the era of GW astronomy

## 13. Comprehensive analysis of time-domain overlapping gravitational wave transients: A Lensing Study

**Abstract**: Comprehensive analysis of time-domain overlapping gravitational wave transients: A Lensing Study Nishkal Rao, Anuj Mishra, Apratim Ganguly, Anupreeta More General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Next-generation GW detectors will produce a high rate of temporally overlapping signals from unrelated compact binary coalescences. Such overlaps can bias parameter estimation (PE) and mimic signatures of other physical effects, such as gravitational lensing. In this work, we investigate how overlapping signals can be degenerate with gravitational lensing by focusing on two scenarios: Type-II strong lensing and microlensing by an isolated point-mass lens. We simulate quasicircular binary black-hole pairs with chirp-mass ratios $\mathscr{M}_{\rm B}/\mathscr{M}_{\rm A}\in\{0.5,\,1,\,2\}$, SNR ratios $\mathrm{SNR}_{\rm B}/\mathrm{SNR}_{\rm A}\in\{0.5,\,1\}$, and coalescence-time offsets $\Delta t_{\rm c}\in[-0.1,\,0.1]~\mathrm{s}$. Bayesian PE and fitting-factor studies show that the Type-II lensing hypothesis is favored over the unlensed quasicircular hypothesis ($\log_{10}\mathscr{B}^{\rm L}_{\rm U}>1$) only in a small region of the overlapping parameter space with $\mathscr{M}_{\rm B}/\mathscr{M}_{\rm A}\gtrsim1$ and $|\Delta t_{\rm c}|\leq0.03~\rm{s}$.. Meanwhile, false evidence for microlensing signatures can arise because, to a reasonable approximation, the model produces two superimposed images whose time delay can closely match $|\Delta t_{\rm c}|$. Overall, the inferred Bayes factor depends on relative chirp-mass ratios, relative loudness, difference in coalescence times, and also the absolute SNRs of the overlapping signals. Cumulatively, our results indicate that overlapping black-hole binaries with nearly equal chirp masses and comparable loudness are likely to be falsely identified as lensed. Such misidentifications are expected to become more common as detector sensitivities improve. While our study focuses on ground-based detectors using appropriate detectability thresholds, the findings naturally extend to next-generation GW observatories.

## 14. Exorcising ghosts with gravitational waves: cases of ghostful and ghost-free fourth-order gravity

**Abstract**: Exorcising ghosts with gravitational waves: cases of ghostful and ghost-free fourth-order gravity Gaetano Lambiase, Shinji Mukohyama, Tanmay Kumar Poddar, Anna Chiara Rescigno 49 pages, 19 figures, comments are welcome General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) General Relativity (GR) is an effective field theory valid in the infrared regime. Quadratic curvature extensions intended to probe ultraviolet physics generically propagate a massive spin-$2$ ghost and are therefore non-unitary. One route to remove ghost is by enlarging the geometric sector (torsion, non-metricity). We investigate the infrared phenomenology of both the standard (ghostful) and ghost-free fourth-order gravity theories by computing Gravitational Wave (GW) emission and confronting the results with observations such as the orbital-period decay of quasi-stable binaries such as PSR B1913+16 and PSR J1738+0333 and the chirp-mass evolution of GW170817. In the ghostful theory, besides the theoretical inconsistency due to non-unitarity, there are also phenomenological problems: the massless spin-$2$ GW flux cancels the combined GW fluxes of the massive spin-$2$ ghost and massive spin-$0$ scalar in the vanishing-mass limit, so the GR quadrupole formula is not recovered at the leading order. As a result, we obtain the GW constraint on the ghostful theory as $m\gtrsim 10^{-11}~\mathrm{eV}$, where $m$ is the mass of the massive modes. By contrast, the ghost-free theory smoothly reproduces the Newtonian potential and GR quadrupole formulae when the two coupling constants $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ vanish, independently of the mass $m$. Therefore, GW observations put mass-dependent upper bounds on the size of the coupling constants. For example, if we assume $\alpha_1\simeq\alpha_2$ for simplicity, then we obtain $\alpha_{1,2}\lesssim 4.2\times 10^{83}$ for $m\sim 3\times 10^{-16}\,\mathrm{eV}$ and $\alpha_{1,2}\lesssim 1.3\times 10^{75}$ for $m\sim 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{eV}$. To our knowledge, these are the first astrophysical-scale bounds reported for ghostful and ghost-free fourth-order gravity.

Oikonomou High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) In this work we shall study the impact of a second order electroweak phase transition occurring at $\sim 150\,$GeV on the energy spectrum of the stochastic gravitational background. Specifically, we assume that the non-minimally coupled Higgs field controls the inflationary era, we find the reheating temperature for the Higgs inflationary model and we demonstrate that the Higgs effective potential exhibits a very weak first order phase transition. This weak first order phase transition is an indication that the electroweak phase transition may not actually proceed as a first order phase transition, but it will proceed as a crossover or second order phase transition. This second order phase transition proceeds with the Higgs field slow-rolling its potential toward to its new minimum. This slow-rolling may deform the radiation domination total equation of state, and the aim of this work is to pinpoint the observational imprints of this total equation of state deformation on the energy spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves, that affects modes that enter the horizon at temperatures $T\sim 150\,$GeV or lower.

**Abstract**: On the use of the Derivative Approximation for Likelihoods for Gravitational Wave Inference Josiel Mendon√ßa Soares de Souza, Miguel Quartin Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an) Posterior inference on the more than a dozen parameters governing a gravitational wave (GW) event is challenging. A typical MCMC analysis can take around $100$ CPU hours, and next generation GW observatories will detect many thousands of events. Here we present a thorough comparison of the accuracy and computational cost of the Fisher Matrix, Derivative Approximation for Likelihoods (DALI) and traditional MCMC methods. We find that using DALI, which extends the traditional Fisher Matrix (FM) method to higher orders, allows for a good approximation of the posterior with a $55$ times smaller computational cost, and that the cost-benefit of the doublet-DALI is better than that of the triplet-DALI. We also show that the singlet-DALI, a hybrid MCMC-Fisher method, is much more accurate than the traditional FM and 10 times faster than the doublet-DALI. A large effort has been invested in forecasting the science case of different detector configurations, and the ability of making fast yet accurate estimations of the posteriors is an important step forward. We also introduce version \texttt{1.0} of the public \texttt{GWDALI} code, which incorporates automatic differentiation, modern waveforms and an optimized parameter decomposition.

**Abstract**: Impact of Magnetic Field Topology on Electromagnetic and Gravitational Waves from Binary Neutron Star Merger Remnants In√™s Rainho, Jamie Bamber, Davide Guerra, Miquel Miravet-Ten√©s, Milton Ruiz, Antonios Tsokaros, Stuart L. Shapiro High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We perform general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers with four distinct magnetic field topologies: (i) a dipole pulsar-like configuration, (ii) a mixed linear superposition of poloidal and toroidal components inside the star, and (iii-iv) two topologies featuring a smooth transition from a confined mixed core to a pulsar-like structure at radii $0.95\,R_{\rm NS}$ and $0.5\,R_{\rm NS}$, with $R_{\rm NS}$ the radius of the star. The latter topologies are explored in BNS merger studies for the first time. We evolve systems with two equations of state (EoS), SLy and WFF1, with ADM masses 2.7 and 2.6, respectively, and include an additional lower-mass SLy binary to probe the behavior of long-lived remnants. We perform an extensive analysis of the emission properties of the systems, both electromagnetic and gravitational waves, and of the properties of the remnants, namely their frequency modes, density eigenfunctions, rotation, temperature, and convective stability. We report three key results: (1) for the first time, we assess the convective stability of magnetized remnants, extending previous unmagnetized analyses; (2) we identify a clear secondary peak in the gravitational-wave spectrum of pulsar-like configurations, consistent with the nonlinear coupling of the $m=0$ and $m=2$ modes, which is absent in other topologies; and (3) the magnetic field topology strongly influences the gravitational wave emission properties to the extent that nearby ($<50\,{\rm Mpc}$) events could allow one to observationally distinguish between different field structures with future gravitational-wave detectors. Across all models, we obtain luminosities compatible with short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), with purely poloidal configurations being the most efficient in driving possible relativistic jets.

The focus is on the comparison with existing phenomenological models and the physical interpretation of the decoherence parameters in such models. The results show that for neutrino oscillations in vacuum gravitationally induced decoherence can be matched with phenomenological models with decoherence parameters of the form $\Gamma_{ij}\sim \Delta m^4_{ij}E^{-2}$. When matter effects are included, the decoherence parameters exhibit a dependence on the varying matter density across the Earth layers. This behavior can be explained by the nature of the coupling between neutrinos and the gravitational wave environment, as suggested by linearised gravity. On a theoretical level, these different models can be characterised by a different choice of Lindblad operators, with the model with decoherence parameters that do not include matter effects being less suitable from the point of view of linearised gravity. Consequently, in the case of neutrino oscillations in matter, the microscopic model does not agree with many existing phenomenological models that assume constant decoherence parameters in matter. Nonetheless, we identify the KamLAND experimental setup as particularly well-suited to establish the first experimental constraints on the model parameters, namely the neutrino coupling to the gravitational wave environment and its temperature, based on a prior analysis using the phenomenological model.

**Abstract**: Hubble-Induced Phase Transitions: Gravitational-Wave Imprint of Ricci Reheating from Lattice Simulations Dario Bettoni, Giorgio Laverda, Asier Lopez-Eiguren, Javier Rubio 17 pages, minor updates to discussion and figures, matches published version General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Gravitational waves offer an unprecedented opportunity to look into the violent high-energy processes happening during the reheating phase of our Universe. We consider a Hubble-induced phase transition scenario as a source of a post-inflationary stochastic background of gravitational waves and analyse the main characteristics of its spectrum for the first time via numerical methods. The output of a large number of fully-fledged classical lattice simulations is condensed in a set of parametric formulas that describe key features of the gravitational wave spectrum, such as its peak amplitude and characteristic frequency, and avoid the need for further time-consuming simulations. The signal from such stochastic background is compared to the prospective sensitivity of future gravitational-wave detectors.

**Abstract**: Gravitational waves decohere quantum superpositions Flynn Linton, Shubhanshu Tiwari Class. Quantum Grav. 42 205005 (2025) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph) Understanding the interplay between quantum mechanical systems and gravity is a crucial step towards unifying these two fundamental ideas. Recent theoretical developments have explored how global properties of spacetime would cause a quantum spatial superposition to lose coherence. In particular, this loss of coherence is closely related to the memory effect, which is a prominent feature of gravitational radiation. In this work, we explore how a burst of gravitational radiation from a far-away source would decohere a quantum superposition. We identify the individual contributions to the decoherence from the memory and oscillatory components of the gravitational wave source, corresponding to soft and hard graviton emissions, respectively. In general, the memory contributions dominate, while the oscillatory component of the decoherence is strongly dependent on the phase of the burst when it is switched off. This work demonstrates how quantum systems can lose coherence from interactions with a classical gravitational field. We also comment on the electromagnetic analogue of this effect and discuss its correspondence to the gravitational case.

We calculate the conversion rate using the magnetic field configurations of leptonic, lepto-hadronic, and hadronic one-zone synchrotron self-Compton models for the blazar jet of Mrk 501. By requiring that the photon flux produced within the blazar jet does not exceed the observed flux of Mrk 501, we derive conservative constraints on the abundance of stochastic gravitational waves. We find that, for all three models considered, the resulting limits can be more stringent than previous constraints in the frequency range from $10^8$ Hz to $10^{15}$ Hz.

**Abstract**: Waging a Campaign: Results from an Injection-Recovery Study involving 35 numerical Relativity Simulations and three Waveform Models Sarp Ak√ßay, Charlie Hoy, Jake Mac Uilliam 30 pages, 12 figures, matches the published version modulo minor differences Physical Review D 112, 084032, 2025 General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We present Bayesian inference results from an extensive injection-recovery campaign to test the validity of three state of the art quasicircular gravitational waveform models: \textsc{SEOBNRv5PHM}, \textsc{IMRPhenomTPHM}, \textsc{IMRPhenomXPHM}, the latter with the \textsc{SpinTaylorT4} implementation for its precession dynamics. We analyze 35 strongly precessing binary black hole numerical relativity simulations with all available harmonic content. Ten simulations have a mass ratio of $4:1$ and five, mass ratio of $8:1$. Overall, we find that \textsc{SEOBNRv5PHM} is the most consistent model to numerical relativity, with the majority of true source properties lying within the inferred 90\% credible interval. However, we find that none of the models can reliably infer the true source properties for binaries with mass ratio $8:1$ systems. We additionally conduct inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) consistency tests to determine if our chosen state of the art waveform models infer consistent properties when analysing only the inspiral (low frequency) and ringdown (high frequency) portions of the signal. For the simulations considered in this work, we find that the IMR consistency test depends on the frequency that separates the inspiral and ringdown regimes. For two sensible choices of the cutoff frequency, we report that \textsc{IMRPhenomXPHM} can produce false GR deviations. Meanwhile, we find that \textsc{IMRPhenomTPHM} is the most reliable model under the IMR consistency test. Finally, we re-analyze the same 35 simulations, but this time we incorporate model accuracy into our Bayesian inference. Consistent with the work in Hoy et al. 2024 [arXiv: 2409.19404], we find this approach generally yields more accurate inferred properties for binary black holes with less biases compared to methods that combine model-dependent posterior distributions based on their evidence, or with equal weight.

**Abstract**: A flexible, GPU-accelerated approach for the joint characterization of LISA instrumental noise and Stochastic Gravitational Wave Backgrounds Alessandro Santini, Martina Muratore, Jonathan Gair, Olaf Hartwig 14 pages, 6 figures. Accepted into PRD. Comments welcome General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) LISA data analysis represents one of the most challenging tasks ahead for the future of gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy. Characterizing the instrument's noise properties while fitting for all the other detectable sources is a key requirement of any robust inference pipeline. Noise estimation will also play a crucial role in searches and parameter estimation of cosmological and astrophysical stochastic signals. Previous studies have tackled this topic by assuming perfect knowledge of the spectral shape of the instrumental noise and of different possible types of GW Stochastic Backgrounds (SGWBs), usually resorting to parametrized templates. Recently, various works that employ template-agnostic methods have been presented. In this work, we take an additional step further, introducing flexible spectral shapes in both the instrumental noise and the stochastic signals. We account for the lack of knowledge of the exact shape of the individual contributions to the overall power spectral density by using splines to represent arbitrary perturbations of the noise and signal spectral densities. We implement a data-driven Reversible Jump MCMC algorithm to fit different components simultaneously and to infer the level of flexibility required under different scenarios. We test this approach on simulated LISA data produced under different assumptions. We investigate the impact of this increased flexibility on the reconstruction of both the injected signal and the noise level, and we discuss the prospects for claiming a successful SGWB detection.

**Abstract**: Generalized Perturbed Kepler Problem: Gravitational Wave Imprints from Eccentric Compact Binaries Rajes Ghosh, R. Prasad, Kabir Chakravarti, Prayush Kumar 17 pages, 7 figures. Updated GW phase and cumulative dephasing expressions. Added Fisher analysis General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Observations of astrophysical binaries may reveal departures from pure Keplerian orbits due to environmental influences, modifications to the underlying gravitational dynamics, or signatures of new physics. In this work, we develop a unified framework to systematically study such perturbations in the ambit of the perturbed Kepler problem and explore their impact on eccentric orbital dynamics and gravitational wave emission. Unlike traditional parametrized frameworks such as post-Newtonian and post-Einsteinian expansions, our approach offers a more source-specific modeling strategy, making it more natural to trace the physical origins of eccentric binary model parameters. Starting from a general perturbed potential, we derive the modified orbit and compute the associated gravitational fluxes and phase evolution, assessing their observational relevance for both current and future detectors. This framework thus offers a general and physically transparent toolkit for probing such subtle deviations from standard dynamics in gravitational wave data.

Even though we recover a common-spectrum stochastic process, potentially induced by a nanohertz gravitational wave background, we find no evidence of continuous waves. Therefore, we place upper limits on the gravitational-wave strain amplitude: in the most sensitive frequency range around 10 nHz, we obtain a sky-averaged 95\% credibility upper limit of $\approx 7 \times 10^{-15}$. Our search is sensitive to supermassive binary black holes with a chirp mass of $\geq 10^9M_{\odot}$ up to a luminosity distance of 50 Mpc for our least sensitive sky direction and 200 Mpc for the most sensitive direction. This work provides at least 4 times better sensitivity in the 1-200 nHz frequency band than our last search based on the PPTA's first data release. We expect that PPTA will continue to play a key role in detecting continuous gravitational waves in the exciting era of nanohertz gravitational wave astronomy.

**Abstract**: Higgs-Induced Gravitational Waves: the Interplay of Non-Minimal Couplings, Kination and Top Quark Mass Giorgio Laverda, Javier Rubio 27 pages, 9 figures, discussion and figures updated, matches published version High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We explore a minimal scenario where the sole Standard-Model Higgs is responsible for reheating the Universe after inflation, produces a significant background of gravitational waves and maintains the full classical stability of the electroweak vacuum. As the Higgs self-coupling runs toward negative values at high energy scales, a non-minimal interaction with curvature during a stiff background expansion era drives the Higgs fluctuations closer to the instability scale. This curvature-induced tachyonic instability leads to an intense production of Higgs particles, accompanied by a stochastic gravitational-wave background. The characteristic features of such signal can be directly correlated to the inflationary scale, the non-minimal coupling parameter and the top quark Yukawa coupling. We distinguish between three possible scenarios: absolute stability with low top quark masses, potential vacuum instability, and absolute stability with new physics above the instability scale. Our findings suggest that the detection of a peaked background of gravitational waves together with its inflationary tail has the potential to unveil the features of the Higgs effective potential at very high energy scales while providing a minimal explanation for the reheating phase and the emergence of the Standard-Model plasma in the early Universe. Unlike other studies in the literature, the generation of gravitational waves in our scenario does not depend on the quantum instability of the Standard Model vacuum.

We validate the approximate likelihoods by comparing them with the exact likelihood for a GW170817-like signal (signal-to-noise ratio ~ 1900) containing higher-order modes of radiation. We use the relative-binning likelihood to perform parameter estimation (PE) for a GW170817-like signal, including Earth-rotation effects, detector-size effects, and higher-order modes. We study the system in several detector networks consisting of a single 40 km Cosmic Explorer, a 20 km CE and a present-generation detector at A+ sensitivity. The PE runs with RB take around a day to complete on a typical cluster.

D 112, 083530 (2025) High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) A fast-rolling axion can transfer its kinetic energy to a gauge field via the Chern-Simons coupling, leading to copious production of gauge quanta, which can act as a source of gravitational waves (GWs) with potentially observable amplitudes. In this work, we investigate GW production in a spectator axion model when strong backreaction is taken into account. We find that decreasing the decay constant of the axion enhances GW production. Since the initial value of the axion is larger than its quantum fluctuations, such a condition imposes a lower bound on the axion dacay constant, which sets an upper bound on the amplitude of the energy spectrum of GWs. As a result, the amplitude of the predicted GW energy spectrum is lower than $10^{-10}$ in the nHz to mHz frequency range.

**Abstract**: Generalized Unitarity Method for Worldline Field Theory Vincent F. He, Julio Parra-Martinez 30 pages + refs, 7 figures. v2: typos corrected, references updated High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We present a generalized unitarity method for theories of point-particle worldlines coupled to gravity, analogous to that of scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory. This method allows the computation of perturbative observables from basic principles such as locality and unitarity, thus avoiding gauge redundancies and the use of Feynman diagrams. We illustrate the method with a variety of examples, including the gravitational waveform for the scattering of two point masses at next-to-leading order (or ${\cal O}(G^{5/2})$), reproducing known results. Our method further streamlines the calculation of the scattering dynamics of compact binary systems and opens the door to further applications and systematical exploration of structure in this class of observables.

**Abstract**: Axion inflation in the regime of homogeneous backreaction Matteo Barbon, Nadir Ijaz, Marco Peloso Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We investigate the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) produced in models of axion inflation coupled to gauge fields. Achieving a detectable signal at Pulsar Timing Array, astrometry, or interferometer frequencies requires a sufficiently strong amplification of the gauge fields, at a level that induces significant backreaction on the inflaton background dynamics. Numerical studies based on the approximation of homogeneous backreaction (i.e., neglecting inhomogeneities of the inflaton field) exhibit oscillations in the inflaton velocity, with corresponding peaks in the SGWB spectrum. The most recent lattice simulations have questioned the validity of this regime, showing examples characterized by a rapid increase in the inflaton gradient energy and the breakdown of homogeneous backreaction. We compute this energy density perturbatively within the assumption of homogeneous backreaction, obtaining examples with a detectable SGWB and with an inflaton gradient energy that remains subdominant to the inflaton zero-mode kinetic energy throughout inflation.

**Abstract**: Production of gravitational waves by inflationary transitions in aligned natural inflation Federico Greco Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) The original axion natural inflation model predicts a tensor-to-scalar ratio exceeding experimental limits. Conversely, in aligned axion inflation, inflation can proceed along trajectories emerging from near a saddle point of the two-field potential and ending through an instability in the orthogonal direction. Such solutions satisfy present observational limits and will be tested by future CMB experiments. Previous studies have suggested the possibility of two distinct inflationary stages separated by a transition characterized by rapid oscillations of the fields. In this work, we demonstrate that the existence of these two stages is a generic feature of the model. We explore a possible phenomenological signature of the transition when a U(1) gauge field is coupled to the axions, namely, the production of gravitational waves (GWs) sourced by gauge quanta generated during the transition. This mechanism produces a feature similar to those seen in spectator axion models or axion inflation with appropriate potentials, i.e. a strongly scale-dependent power spectrum. The scale at which the GW spectrum is produced is determined by the duration of the second inflationary phase. Consequently, the spectrum may peak at different frequencies, potentially detectable by future GW experiments.

By adopting three tiers of consistency metrics, we compare cosmological constraints between subsets of the KiDS-Legacy dataset split by redshift, angular scale, galaxy colour and spatial region. We also review a range of two-point cosmic shear statistics. With the data passing all our consistency metric tests, we demonstrate that KiDS-Legacy is the most internally consistent KiDS catalogue to date. In a joint cosmological analysis of KiDS-Legacy and DES Y3 cosmic shear, combined with data from the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae compilation and baryon acoustic oscillations from DESI Y1, we find constraints consistent with Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background with $S_8\equiv \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3} = 0.814^{+0.011}_{-0.012}$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.802^{+0.022}_{-0.018}$.

**Abstract**: First Light And Reionization Epoch Simulations (FLARES) -- XIX: Supermassive black hole mergers in the early Universe and their environmental dependence Shihong Liao, Dimitrios Irodotou, Maxwell G. A. Maltz, Christopher C. Lovell, Zhen Jiang, Sophie L. Newman, Aswin P. Vijayan, Paurush Punyasheel, William J. Roper, Louise T. C. Seeyave, Sonja Soininen, Peter A. Thomas, Stephen M. Wilkins 16 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The upcoming space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatory, LISA, is expected to detect GW signals from supermassive black hole (SMBH) mergers occurring at high redshifts. However, understanding the origin and growth of SMBHs in the early Universe remains an open problem in astrophysics. In this work, we utilize the First Light And Reionization Epoch Simulations (FLARES), a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations, to study SMBH mergers at $5 \lesssim z \lesssim 10$ across a wide range of environments. Most mergers in FLARES involve secondary SMBHs near the seed mass ($m_{\rm seed} \approx 1.5 \times 10^{5}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$) while primary SMBHs span up to $10^{9}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$, resulting in mass ratios from $q \sim 10^{-4}$ to $1$, with a peak at $q \sim 1$. The number of mergers increases rapidly towards lower redshifts, and the comoving total number density scales with overdensity as $n_{\rm merger} = 10^{-3.81} (1 + \delta)^{4.78}$. Denser regions host more massive mergers, with higher merger redshifts and lower mass ratios. Within the FLARES redshift range, LISA is expected to detect mergers with $10^{5} \lesssim M_{\rm tot}/{\rm M}_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{8}$ and $q \gtrsim 10^{-2}$, corresponding to a detection rate of $0.030~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ for events with signal-to-noise ratio ${\rm SNR} \geq 10$. Our study demonstrates the sensitivity of GW predictions at high redshifts to SMBH seed models and merger time delays, highlighting the need for improved modeling in future cosmological simulations to maximize LISA's scientific return.

We consider a scenario where the number asymmetry is generated from the decay of a mother particle produced via parametric resonance during the phase transition induced due to its coupling to the dilaton associated with spontaneous breaking of scale invariance. It is shown that the correct baryon asymmetry and dark matter abundance can be realized for a dark phase transition at $\mathcal{O}(1) \, \rm GeV$, which can also explain the nano-Hz gravitational wave signal reported by pulsar timing array experiments. The scenario will be tested further in neutron-antineutron oscillation experiments.

**Abstract**: Early X-ray emission of short Gamma-Ray Bursts: insights into physics and multi-messenger prospects Annarita Ierardi, Gor Oganesyan, Stefano Ascenzi, Marica Branchesi, Biswajit Banerjee, Samuele Ronchini High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Early X-ray emission of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) traces the transition between the prompt emission and the afterglow radiation, and its rapid flux decline is often interpreted as the tail of the prompt emission. As such, it can offer insights into the emission mechanisms active during the prompt emission and the physics of GRB jets. In this work, we focus on merger-driven GRBs, which are sources of gravitational waves (GWs) detectable by ground-based interferometers, such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. We present a systematic analysis of the early X-ray emission ($t < 10^3 \ \mathrm{s}$) of a sample of 16 merger-driven GRB candidates detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (hereafter, Swift). We performed a time-resolved spectral analysis of soft and hard X-ray data (0.3-150 keV) by fitting two curved spectral models to the spectra: a physical synchrotron model and an empirical smoothly broken power law model. We characterized the evolution of the peak energy and bolometric flux, and derived the intrinsic properties of the 10 bursts with measured redshift. We discovered a tight correlation between the rest-frame peak energy of the spectra and the isotropic-equivalent luminosity. Specifically, we obtained $\nu_{c,z} \propto L_{\rm iso}^{(0.64 \pm 0.03)}$ when adopting the synchrotron model, and $E_{p,z} \propto L_{\rm iso}^{(0.58 \pm 0.04)}$ when adopting the smoothly broken power law. Both relations were extrapolated to the typical prompt emission energies and well describe the properties of short GRBs detected in the MeV gamma-rays. These results suggest a common origin for the prompt and steep-decay emissions in merger-driven GRBs, and rule out high-latitude emission as the dominant process shaping the early X-ray tails. Finally, we assessed the detectability of these sources with the Wide-field X-ray Telescope onboard the Einstein Probe mission.

Wahl 20 pages, 11 figures, Submitted to APJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Wideband timing of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) datasets, where a single time-of-arrival (TOA) and a single dispersion measure (DM) are measured using the entire bandwidth of each observation, was first done for the 12.5-year dataset, and proved to be invaluable for characterizing the time-varying dispersion measure, reducing the data volume, and for improving the overall timing precision. The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) Telescope has been observing most NANOGrav millisecond pulsars (MSPs) at nearly daily cadence (compared to roughly monthly cadence for other NANOGrav observations) since 2019 with the objective of integration into future pulsar timing array (PTA) datasets. In this paper, we show the results of integration of high-cadence, low-observing-frequency CHIME data with data from the NANOGrav experiment for an isolated MSP PSR~J0645$+$5158 and three binary MSPs PSR~J1012$+$5307, PSR~J2145$-$0750, and PSR~J2302$+$4442. Using a wideband timing pipeline which we also describe, we present updated timing results for all four sources, including improvements in measurements of relativistic post-Keplerian parameters for the three binary pulsars in this analysis. For PSR~J2302$+$4442, we report an updated strong detection of Shapiro delay from which we measured a companion mass of $0.35^{+0.05}_{-0.04}\ M_{\odot}$, a pulsar mass of $1.8^{+0.3}_{-0.3}\ M_{\odot}$, and an orbital inclination of ${80^{\circ}}^{+1}_{-2}$. We also report updated constraints on the reflex motion for PSR~J2145$-$0750 using a combination of Very Long Baseline Array astrometry and our updated measurement of the time derivative of the projected semi-major axis of the pulsar orbit as a prior.

Williams 37 pages, 12 figures. Submitted to ApJL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Kilonovae, the ultraviolet/optical/infrared counterparts to binary neutron star mergers, are an exceptionally rare class of transients. Optical follow-up campaigns are plagued by impostors whose early evolution masquerades as the rapid radioactive decay of heavy elements. In this work, we present an analysis of the multi-wavelength dataset of supernova (SN) 2025ulz, a proposed kilonova candidate following the low-significance detection of gravitational waves originating from the potential binary neutron star merger S250818k. Despite an early rapid decline in brightness, our multi-wavelength observations of SN 2025ulz reveal that it is a type IIb supernova. As part of this analysis, we demonstrate the capabilities of a novel quantitative scoring algorithm to determine the likelihood that a transient candidate is a kilonova, based primarily on its 3D location and light curve evolution. We also apply our scoring algorithm to other transient candidates in the localization volume of S250818k and find that, at all times after the discovery of SN 2025ulz, there are $\geq 4$ candidates with a score more promising than SN 2025ulz. During future kilonova searches, this type of scoring algorithm will be useful to rule out contaminating transients in real time, optimizing the use of valuable telescope resources.

## 38. Extracting SASI signatures from Gravitational Waves of Core-Collapse Supernovae using the Hilbert-Huang Transform

**Abstract**: Extracting SASI signatures from Gravitational Waves of Core-Collapse Supernovae using the Hilbert-Huang Transform Alessandro Veutro, Irene Di Palma, Angela Zegarelli High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Core collapse supernovae are among the most energetic astrophysical events in the Universe. Despite huge efforts on understanding the main ingredients triggering such explosions, we still lack of compelling evidences for the precise mechanism driving those phenomena. They are expected to produce gravitational waves due to asymmetric mass motions in the collapsing core, and emit in the meanwhile neutrinos as a result of the interactions in their high-density environment. The combination of these two cosmic messengers can provide a unique probe to study the inner engine of these processes and unveil the explosion mechanism. Among the possible detectable signature, standing accretion shock instabilities (SASI) are particularly relevant in this context as they establish a direct connection between gravitational wave emission and the outcoming neutrino flux. In this work, Hilbert-Huang transform is applied to a selected sample of 3D numerical simulations, with the aim of identifying SASI contribution and extract its instantaneous frequency. The performance of the method is evaluated in the context of Einstein Telescope.

**Abstract**: Simulating Binary Neutron Star Mergers with Finite-temperature Equations of State: The influences of the slope of the symmetry energy and artificial heating Henrique Gieg, Maximiliano Ujevic, Armen Sedrakian, Tim Dietrich 15 pages, 10 figures. To be submitted to PRD. Comments are welcome! General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th) We present a new set of numerical-relativity simulations of merging binary neutron stars, aiming to identify possible observable signatures of the slope of the symmetry energy $L_{\rm sym}$. To achieve this goal, we employ a set of equations of state based on a parameterization of the covariant density functional theory of nuclear matter that allows controlled variations of $L_{\rm sym}$ and the skewness $Q_{\rm sat}$, holding the latter fixed. For a set of our simulations, we identify a steep energy gradient in the equation of state at subsaturation densities, which acts as a source of heating with subsequent stiffening produced by thermal support. Accounting for related structural modifications in the tidal deformability reconciles our results with theoretical expectations. On the other hand, we show that gravitational waves are unlikely to distinguish the role of $L_{\rm sym}$. In contrast to this, we find that the ejecta composition is significantly altered in our simulations, which employ an M1 moment scheme, when $L_{\rm sym}$ is varied. Based on our extracted dynamical ejecta properties, we compute r-process yields and find that they are distinct for the different $L_{\rm sym}$, especially at lower mass numbers $A \lesssim 120$. This suggests that electromagnetic counterparts are more likely to exhibit signatures; however, a direct connection to $L_{\rm sym}$ remains a challenge, given the complex interplay between details of the ejecta properties and the kilonova signal.

**Abstract**: Black hole mass function shift in proto-stellar-clusters driven by gas accretion Zacharias Roupas Astronomy & Astrophysics, 702, A208 (2025) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has observed compact, massive proto-stellar clusters of low metallicity in the Cosmic Gems arc galaxy at high redshift, which represent likely precursors to globular clusters. We model the mass growth of stellar black holes (BHs) during the first few Myr of the life of a massive, compact, gaseous stellar cluster before stellar feedback expels the primordial gas. At high redshift, in a lower metallicity environment stellar winds get weaker allowing for larger gas-depletion time-scales in the cluster despite of energetic pair-instability supernova (PISN) feedback for sufficiently compact clusters. Mass segregation drives the massive stellar progenitors of BHs in the center of the cluster where gas is most dense. We estimate the conditions for which the initial black hole mass function (BHMF), with a PISN-induced cut-off $<55{\rm M}_\odot$, gets shifted to values within the upper BH mass gap, $\sim 60-130{\rm M}_\odot$, or higher, as observed by Gravitational Wave (GW) experiments LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. We find that the BHs are shifted by the end of gas depletion to values within and above the mass gap, well within the range of BH components of the recent GW-signal GW231123, depending on total mass, star formation efficiency, metallicity and compactness. The individual BH mass increase follows approximately a surprisingly steep power law with respect to initial BH mass with an exponent in the range $\approx 4-6$. This occurs in gaseous proto-stellar clusters that are sufficiently massive and compact, with typical values of total mass $\sim 10^6{\rm M}_\odot$ and size $\sim 1{\rm pc}$. Our analysis suggests that proto-stellar clusters at high redshift such as Cosmic Gems arc clusters have generated through early gas accretion, BHs as heavy as $\sim 10^2-10^3{\rm M}_\odot$.

**Abstract**: Investigating the Effects of Point Source Injection Strategies on KMTNet Real/Bogus Classification Dongjin Lee, Gregory S.H. Paek, Seo-Won Chang, Changwan Kim, Mankeun Jeong, Hongjae Moon, Seong-Heon Lee, Jae-Hun Jung, Myungshin Im Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Recently, machine learning-based real/bogus (RB) classifiers have demonstrated effectiveness in filtering out artifacts and identifying genuine transients in real-time astronomical surveys. However, the rarity of transient events and the extensive human labeling required for a large number of samples pose significant challenges in constructing training datasets for RB classification. Given these challenges, point source injection techniques, which inject simulated point sources into optical images, provide a promising solution. This paper presents the first detailed comparison of different point source injection strategies and their effects on classification performance within a simulation-to-reality framework. To this end, we first construct various training datasets based on Random Injection (RI), Near Galaxy Injection (NGI), and a combined approach by using the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network datasets. Subsequently, we train convolutional neural networks on simulated cutout samples and evaluate them on real, imbalanced datasets from gravitational wave follow-up observations for GW190814 and S230518h. Extensive experimental results show that RI excels at asteroid detection and bogus filtering but underperforms on transients occurring near galaxies (e.g., supernovae). In contrast, NGI is effective for detecting transients near galaxies but tends to misclassify variable stars as transients, resulting in a high false positive rate. The combined approach effectively handles these trade-offs, thereby balancing between detection rate and false positive rate. Our results emphasize the importance of point source injection strategy in developing robust RB classifiers for transient (or multi-messenger) follow-up campaigns.
