**Abstract**: Trapped surface formation for the Einstein-Weyl spinor system Peng Zhao, Xiaoning Wu General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph) We prove trapped-surface formation for the Einstein-Weyl spinor system (gravity coupled to a massless left-handed two-spinor) without any symmetry assumption. To this end we establish a semi-global solution under double null foliation and show that the focusing of the gravitational waves and the Weyl spinor flux leads to the formation of a trapped surface.

**Abstract**: A Comprehensive Framework for F-statistic-based Parameter Estimation of Binary Black Hole Signals Hai-Tian Wang General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a comprehensive investigation of the F-statistic method for parameter estimation of gravitational wave (GW) signals from binary black hole mergers. By analytically maximizing the likelihood over the luminosity distance and polarization angle, this approach reduces the dimensionality of the parameter space to enhance computational efficiency. We also introduce a novel formulation for calculating the Bayes factor for the F-statistic, enabling a quantitative assessment of its performance against standard full frequency-domain (FFD) Bayesian inference. Using the benchmark event GW150914, we demonstrate that the F-statistic method is not only approximately $70\%$ faster than FFD but is also statistically stable across different sampler configurations, with a log-Bayes factor between runs smaller than $0.1$. Furthermore, the F-statistic exhibits superior stability against changes in sampler configuration, yielding consistently lower Jensen-Shannon divergence values between analysis runs. While the F-statistic produces slightly broader constraints on some parameters, we argue this represents a more honest uncertainty quantification, particularly in high-dimensional parameter spaces with complex posterior structures. These results highlight the significant advantages of the F-statistic method for GW data analysis, positioning it as a powerful tool for the era of high-rate detections with future observatories.

## 3. Residual Test for the Third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog

**Abstract**: Residual Test for the Third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog Dicong Liang, Ning Dai, Yingjie Yang 13 pages, 5 figures, comments are welcome General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The residual test is commonly used to check the agreement between the gravitational wave signal and the theoretical waveform template. The basic idea of the residual test is to subtract the best-fit waveform from the data and then check whether the remaining data (i.e., the residuals) are consistent with the instrumental noise or not. We apply the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the Anderson-Darling test and the chi-squared test as goodness-of-fit test to examine the residuals of events in the third gravitational-wave transient catalog and find no statistically significant deviation from the noise. Although our method is sensitive only to the loud events, it does not rely on the cross-correlation between detectors. A single-detector event suffices for our residual analysis, and the test is simple and computationally inexpensive.

**Abstract**: Importance of Shot Noise in the Search for an Isotropic Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background with Next Generation Detectors Haowen Zhong, Vuk Mandic General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We investigate the impact of shot noise on the stochastic gravitational wave background generated by binary neutron star mergers, and confirm that the overall background can be significantly influenced by relatively few neighboring, loud events. To mitigate the shot noise, we propose a procedure to remove nearby events by notching them out in the time-frequency domain. Additionally, we quantify the cosmic/sample variance of the resulting background after notching, and we study the deviation between the cross-correlation measurement and the theoretical prediction of the background. Taking both effects into account, we find that the resulting sensitivity loss in the search for an isotropic background formed by binary neutron star mergers is minimal, and is limited to $\lesssim 4\%$ below 40 Hz, and to $\lesssim 1\%$ above 40 Hz.

**Abstract**: TESLA-X: An effective method to search for sub-threshold lensed gravitational waves with a targeted population model Alvin K. Y. Li, Juno C.L. Chan, Heather Fong, Aidan H.Y. Chong, Alan J. Weinstein, Jose M. Ezquiaga Mon Not R Astron Soc (2025) 998-1010 General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Strong gravitational lensing can produce copies of gravitational-wave signals from the same source with the same waveform morphologies but different amplitudes and arrival times. Some of these strongly-lensed gravitational-wave signals can be demagnified and become subthreshold. We present TESLA-X, an enhanced approach to the original GstLAL-based TargetEd Subthreshold Lensing seArch (TESLA) method, for improving the detection efficiency of these potential subthreshold lensed signals. TESLA-X utilizes lensed injections to generate a targeted population model and a targeted template bank. We compare the performance of a full template bank search, TESLA, and TESLA-X methods via a simulation campaign, and demonstrate the performance of TESLA-X in recovering lensed injections, particularly targeting a mock event. Our results show that the TESLA-X method achieves a maximum of $\sim 10\%$ higher search sensitivity compared to the TESLA method within the subthreshold regime, presenting a step towards detecting the first lensed gravitational wave. TESLA-X will be employed for the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's collaboration-wide analysis to search for lensing signatures in the fourth observing run.

**Abstract**: Probing Formation Channels of Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals Houyi Sun, Ya-Ping Li, Zhen Pan, Huan Yang 39 pages, 32 figures, 2 tables, submitted to PRD General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The population study of stellar-mass black hole (sBH) binaries with ground-based gravitational wave detection has achieved tremendous success in recent years. Future observation of extreme mass-ratio inspirals will similarly require proper population analysis that identify the formation channels, measuring the branch ratio(s) and characterizing major properties within each major channel. In this work, we propose that the measurement of eccentricity, inclination, and component mass provides critical information to distinguish different formation channels and probe detailed formation mechanisms. Focusing on the dry and wet extreme mass-ratio inspirals, we establish the theoretical expectation of these observables in each formation channel. We also discuss how their distributions can be used to probe lifetime and turbulence level of active galactic nuclei disks, accretion patterns of supermassive black holes and population properties of sBHs within nuclear star clusters.

**Abstract**: Towards detecting the temporal fluctuations from gravitational waves in asynchronous gauges Stefano Bondani, Sergio Luigi Cacciatori 52 pages, 5 figures, minor changes, corrected typos General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The experimental possibility of detecting gravitational waves via their induced time perturbations is explored here, expanding from previous work. The oscillations of the time-time component in the metric are made explicit when working in asynchronous gauges: the desynchronization between a perturbed clock and a reference unperturbed clock constitutes the corresponding observable core target of a detector. To this end we explore the experimental techniques currently available for a preliminary assessment towards a feasibility study. We survey the state of the art in the fields of high precision timing and information preservation, necessary for achieving geodesic non-locality. A synthesis for a feasible prototype detector with the desired characteristics is presented. The optimum point between existing technologies is found around the 1 Hz frequency band, opening the window for the observation of classes of speculated sources of gravitational radiation such as intermediate mass black hole binaries.

## 9. Constraints on Pre-Big-Bang Cosmology from Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo's First Three Observing Runs

**Abstract**: Constraints on Pre-Big-Bang Cosmology from Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo's First Three Observing Runs Qin Tan, Zu Cheng Chen, You Wu, Lang Liu 8 pages, 3 figures, CTP accepted; Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We search for the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) predicted by pre-big-bang (PBB) cosmology using data from the first three observing runs of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. PBB cosmology proposes an alternative to cosmic inflation where the Universe evolves from a weak-coupling, low-curvature state to the hot Big Bang through a high-curvature bounce phase, predicting a distinctive SGWB spectrum. We perform a Bayesian analysis of the cross-correlation data to constrain the model parameters characterizing the PBB spectrum. We find no evidence for a PBB-induced SGWB, with a Bayes factor of $0.03$ between the PBB and noise-only model, strongly favoring the noise-only hypothesis. Our analysis establishes a lower bound $\beta \gtrsim -0.19$ at $95\%$ confidence level, which is compatible with the theoretical requirement $\beta \geq 0$ for a smooth bounce transition. While we do not detect a signal, our constraints remain consistent with the basic theoretical framework of PBB cosmology, demonstrating the potential of gravitational-wave observations to test early Universe theories.

**Abstract**: GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole binary merger: properties and astrophysical implications Isobel Romero-Shaw, Jakob Stegmann, Hiromichi Tagawa, Davide Gerosa, Johan Samsing, Nihar Gupte, Stephen R. Green 13 pages, 3 figures. Accepted for publication in PRD High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Detecting orbital eccentricity in a stellar-mass black-hole merger would point to a non-isolated formation channel. Eccentric binaries can form in dense stellar environments such as globular clusters or active galactic nuclei, or from triple stellar systems in the Galactic field. However, confidently measuring eccentricity is challenging -- short signals from high-mass eccentric mergers can mimic spin-induced precession, making the two effects hard to disentangle. This degeneracy weakens considerably for longer-duration signals. Here, GW200208_222617 provides a rare opportunity. Originating from a relatively low-mass binary with source-frame chirp mass $\sim20$ M$_\odot$, its gravitational-wave signal spanned $\sim14$ orbital cycles in band, with no indication of data quality issues. Previous analyses for quasi-circular binaries found no evidence for spin precession, and multiple subsequent studies found the data to favour an eccentric merger despite notable technical differences. All in all, we believe GW200208_222617 is the black-hole merger event from GWTC-3 with the least ambiguous detection of eccentricity. We present a critical discussion of properties and astrophysical interpretation of GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole merger using models of field triples, globular clusters, and active galactic nuclei. We find that if GW200208_222617 was indeed eccentric, its origin is consistent with a field triple or globular cluster. Formation in the inner regions of an active galactic nucleus is disfavoured. The outer regions of such a disk remain a viable origin for GW200208_222617; we demonstrate how future detections of eccentric mergers formed in such environments could be powerful tools for constraining the disk geometry.

Barone, B. Barr, L. Barsotti, M. Barsuglia As part of the Astrophysical Journal Letters Focus Issue on the Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We detail the population properties of merging compact objects using 158 mergers from the cumulative Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 4.0, which includes three types of binary mergers: binary neutron star, neutron star--black hole binary, and binary black hole mergers. We resolve multiple over- and under-densities in the black hole mass distribution: features persist at primary masses of $10\,M_\odot$ and $35\,M_\odot$ with a possible third feature at $\sim 20\,M_\odot$. These are departures from an otherwise power-law-like continuum that steepens above $35\,M_\odot$. Binary black holes with primary masses near $10\,M_\odot$ are more likely to have less massive secondaries, with a mass ratio distribution peaking at $q = 0.74^{+0.13}_{-0.13}$, potentially a signature of stable mass transfer during binary evolution. Black hole spins are inferred to be non-extremal, with 90\% of black holes having $\chi < 0.57$, and preferentially aligned with binary orbits, implying many merging binaries form in isolation. However, we find a significant fraction, 0.24--0.42, of binaries have negative effective inspiral spins, suggesting many could be formed dynamically in gas-free environments. We find evidence for correlation between effective inspiral spin and mass ratio, though it is unclear if this is driven by variation in the mode of the distribution or the width. (Abridged)

**Abstract**: High-Quality Axion Dark Matter at Gravitational Wave Interferometers Disha Bandyopadhyay, Debasish Borah, Nayan Das, Rome Samanta High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Gravitational effects are known to violate global symmetries, threatening the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) solution to the strong CP problem. Ultraviolet completions featuring a gauged $U(1)$ symmetry, where $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$ arises as an accidental global symmetry, can suppress Planck-suppressed operators, enabling high-quality axions in a mass window where it can also account for the observed dark matter (DM) in the Universe. We show that in such models, the spontaneous breaking of the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry generates a strong stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from gauge cosmic string loops. For breaking scales $\gtrsim 10^{14}$ GeV, the SGWB signal strength exceeds astrophysical foregrounds across a broad frequency range. Contrary to conventional gauge cosmic string scenarios, such quality axion models have a characteristic IR break frequency originating from the collapse of string-wall network around axion oscillation temperature. We propose this characteristic SGWB frequency-amplitude region, identified as \textit{Signature-Window-Axion-Gravitational waves} (SWAG), to be a novel probe of high-quality axion DM at future space and ground-based interferometers.

**Abstract**: Evolution of LISA Observables for Binary Black Holes Lensed by an SMBH Jake Postiglione, K. E. Saavik Ford, Henry Best, Barry McKernan, Matthew O'Dowd 11 pages, 5 figures, ApJ (accepted) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Binary black holes (BBH) are expected to form and merge in active galactic nuclei (AGN), deep in the potential well of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), from populations that exist in a nuclear star cluster (NSC). Here we investigate the gravitational wave (GW) signature of a BBH lensed by a nearby SMBH. For a fiducial GW150914-like BBH orbiting close to a $10^{8}M_{\odot}$ SMBH located at $z=0.1$, the lensed GW signal varies in a predictable manner in and out of the LISA detectability band and across frequencies. The occurrence of such signatures has the potential to confound LISA global fit models if they are not modelled. Detection of these sources provide an independent measure of AGN inclination angles, along with detecting warping of the inner disk, and measuring the SMBH spin.

Broekgaarden, Lara Nava, Bruno Giacomazzo, Monica Colpi 18 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in A&A. Comments are welcome! High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The Einstein Telescope (ET), a proposed next-generation gravitational wave (GW) observatory, will expand the reach of GW astronomy of stellar-mass compact object binaries to unprecedented distances, enhancing opportunities for multi-messenger observations. Here we investigate multi-messenger emission properties of binary neutron star (NSNS) and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers detectable by ET, providing projections to optimize observational strategies and maximize scientific insights from these sources. Using a synthetic population of compact binary mergers, we model each source's GW signal-to-noise ratio, sky localization uncertainty, kilonova (KN) light curves in optical and near-infrared bands, fluence of the relativistic jet gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission and afterglow light curves across radio, optical, X-ray and very high energy wavelengths. We analyze multi-messenger detectability prospects for ET as a standalone observatory with two different configurations and within a network of next-generation GW detectors. ET will detect over $10^4$ NSNS mergers annually, enabling potential observation of tens to hundreds of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. BHNS mergers have more limited multi-messenger prospects, but joint GW-EM rates will increase by an order of magnitude compared to current-generation instruments. We quantify uncertainties due to the NS equation of state (EoS) and mass distribution of NSNSs, as well as the NS EoS and BH spin for BHNSs. While a single ET will achieve an impressive GW detection rate, the fraction of well-localized events is orders of magnitude lower than in a network with additional detectors. This significantly limits efficient EM follow-up and science cases requiring well-characterized counterparts or early observations. The challenge is even greater for BHNS mergers due to their low EM rate.

N. Schneider (Elsevier) Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Population III (or Pop. III) stars, the first stellar generation built up from metal-free primordial gas, first started to form at redshifts z ~ 30. They formed primarily in small dark matter halos with masses of a few million solar masses. The cooling of the gas in these halos was dominated on all scales by molecular hydrogen. Current theoretical models indicate that Pop. III stars typically formed in small clusters with a logarithmically flat mass function due to widespread fragmentation in the protostellar accretion disks around these primordial stars. Massive Pop. III stars are thought to have played a pivotal role in shaping the early Universe, as their feedback regulates subsequent star formation, although the immediate effects of this feedback remain uncertain. Direct detection of Pop. III stars is challenging, but our chances of detecting at least a few Pop. III supernovae within the next decade are brighter. Indirect approaches based on stellar archaeology or gravitational wave detections offer promising constraints. Current observations suggest that most massive Pop. III stars ended their lives as core-collapse supernovae rather than pair-instability supernovae, offering insight into the initial mass function and evolutionary pathways of these primordial stars.

Accepted to A&A Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) ESA's Euclid cosmology mission relies on the very sensitive and accurately calibrated spectroscopy channel of the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP). With three operational grisms in two wavelength intervals, NISP provides diffraction-limited slitless spectroscopy over a field of $0.57$ deg$^2$. A blue grism $\text{BG}_\text{E}$ covers the wavelength range $926$--$1366$\,nm at a spectral resolution $R=440$--$900$ for a $0.5''$ diameter source with a dispersion of $1.24$ nm px$^{-1}$. Two red grisms $\text{RG}_\text{E}$ span $1206$ to $1892$\,nm at $R=550$--$740$ and a dispersion of $1.37$ nm px$^{-1}$. We describe the construction of the grisms as well as the ground testing of the flight model of the NISP instrument where these properties were established.
