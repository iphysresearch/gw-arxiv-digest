GWs from compact binary coalescences like Black Holes or Neutron Stars behave like standard sirens and can be used as cosmological probes. To this aim, generally, the observation of an electromagnetic counterpart and the measurement of the redshift are needed. However, even when those are not available, it is still possible to exploit these \"dark sirens\" via statistical methods. In this work, we explore a method that exploits the information contained in the cross-correlation of samples of GW events with matter over-density tracers like galaxy catalogues. Contrary to other currently employed dark-sirens methods, this approach does not suffer from systematic errors related to the incompleteness of the galaxy catalogue. To further enhance the technique, we implement tomography in redshift space for the galaxy catalogue and luminosity distance space for the GWs. We simulate future data collected by the array of currently existing detectors, namely LIGO, Virgo, and Kagra, as well as planned third-generation ones such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorers. We cross-correlate these data with those from upcoming photometric galaxy surveys such as Euclid. We perform a sensitivity forecast employing a full-likelihood approach and explore the parameter space with Monte Carlo Markov Chains. We find that with this method, third-generation detectors will be able to determine the Hubble constant $H_0$ with an error of only 0.7%, which is enough to provide decisive information to shed light on the Hubble tension. Furthermore, for the other cosmological parameters, we find that the GWs and galaxy surveys information are highly complementary, and the use of both significantly improves the ability to constrain the underlying cosmology.",

Duez, Francois Foucart, Patrick Chi-Kit Cheong, Nishad Muhammed High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Two-dimensional axisymmetric simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) merger remnant are a cheap alternative to 3D simulations. To maintain realism for secular timescales, simulations must avoid accumulated errors from drifts in conserved quantities and artificial heating, and they must model turbulent transport in a way that remains plausible throughout the evolution. It is also crucial to avoid numerical artifacts due to the polar coordinate axis singularity. Methods that behave well near the axis often break flux-conservative form of the hydrodynamic equations, resulting in significant drifts in conserved quantities. We present a flux-conservative scheme that maintains smoothness near the axis without sacrificing conservative formulation of the equations or incurring drifts in conserved global quantities. We compare the numerical performance of different treatments of the hydrodynamic equations when evolving a hypermassive neutron star resembling the remnant of a BNS merger. These simulations demonstrate that the new scheme combines the axis smoothness of non-conservative methods with the mass and angular momentum conservation of other conservative methods on $\\sim$ $10^2$ ms timescales of viscous and neutrino-driven evolution. Because fluid profiles remain smooth in the remnant interior, it is possible to remove artificial heating by evolving the entropy density. We show how physical heating and cooling terms can be easily calculated from source terms of the conservative evolution variables and demonstrate our implementation. Finally, we discuss and implement improvements to the effective viscosity scheme to better model the effect of magnetohydrodynamic instabilities as the remnant evolves.",

In this work, we perform a model-independent reconstruction of the dark-energy equation of state $w(z)$, jointly with an evolving Hubble constant $H_0(z)$. Using the DESI DR2 data combined with multiple type Ia supernova samples, we find that $w(z)$ varies with redshift and exhibits two potential phantom crossings at $z\\sim0.5$ and $z\\sim1.5$. Meanwhile, $H_0$ decreases continually from local to high redshift, alleviating the Hubble constant tension effectively. The joint $w(z)$-$H_0(z)$ model is strongly favored over the $w$CDM ($\\Lambda$CDM) framework, with a logarithmic Bayes factor $\\ln \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal B}= 5.04~(8.53)$. Across various prior assumptions and dataset combinations, we obtain consistent, data-driven reconstructions of both $w(z)$ and $H_0(z)$.

As multi-messenger sources, they emit both gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation across several frequency bands. The interpretation of these signals relies heavily on accurate numerical-relativity simulations that incorporate the relevant microphysical processes. Using the latest updates of the BAM code, we perform general-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star mergers with two different spin configurations. We adopt a state-of-the-art equation of state based on relativistic mean-field theory developed for dense matter in neutron star mergers. To capture both dynamical ejecta and secular outflows from magnetic and neutrino-driven winds, we evolve the systems up to $\\sim 100\\ \\rm ms$ after the merger at considerably high resolution with a grid spacing of $\\Delta x \\approx 93\\ \\rm m$ across the neutron stars. Our results show that the non-spinning configuration undergoes a more violent merger, producing more ejecta with lower electron fraction and higher velocities, while the spinning configuration forms a larger disk due to its higher angular momentum. Although the initial magnetic field amplification within $\\lesssim 10\\ \\rm ms$ after merger is similar in both systems, the non-spinning system reaches stronger magnetic fields and higher energies at later times. For a detailed view of the multi-messenger observables, we extract the gravitational-wave signal and compute nucleosynthesis yields, the expected kilonova and afterglow light curves from our ejecta profiles.",

Mainly focusing on the Palatini formulation of gravity, a phase space analysis reveals the existence of a late-time stable de Sitter attractor as long as the non-minimal coupling constant is negative, regardless of the value of the slope of the exponential. Fitting to CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, we find strong evidence for our model over $\\Lambda$CDM, with a Bayes factor $\\log B = 5.52$.

Lensed gravitational waves in particular allow for unparalleled sensitivity to small scale structures within the lenses, due to the precise time resolution in combination with the continuous monitoring of the entire sky. In this work, we show two distinct ways of using strongly lensed gravitational waves to identify the presence of dark matter subhalos: \\emph{i)} through higher order caustics generating high relative magnification ($\\mu_r > 2$), short time delay image pairs that break the caustic universality relations of single dark matter halos, which occur for $\\sim 1-10$ percent of strongly lensed events in our cold dark matter models, and \\emph{ii)} through the presence of more than three highly magnified images, which occur for $\\sim 0.01-1$ percent of the same simulated events. We find that these results are highly sensitive to the concentrations of subhalos in our simulations, and more mildly to their number densities. The presence of low-mass subhalos increases the probability of observing wave-optics lensing in lensed gravitational waves, which is studied by solving the diffraction integral with the stationary phase approximation, as well as numerically. We also report distinct quantitative and qualitative differences in the distributions of relative magnifications and time delays for subhalo populations with increased number densities or concentrations. With the upcoming detection of strongly lensed events by ground- and space- based detectors, comparisons against these simulated distributions will provide insight into the nature of dark matter.",

However, their poor sky localisation and the typical lack of observable electromagnetic (EM) counterparts make it difficult to confidently identify their hosts, and study the environments that nurture their evolution. In this work, we show that $\\textit{detailed}$ information of the host environment (e.g. the mass and steepness of the host potential) can be directly inferred by measuring the kinematic parameters (acceleration and its time-derivatives) of the binary's center of mass using GWs alone, without requiring an EM counterpart. We consider CBCs in various realistic environments such as globular clusters, nuclear star clusters, and active galactic nuclei disks to demonstrate how orbit and environment parameters can be extracted for CBCs detectable by ground- and space-based observatories, including the LIGO detector at A+ sensitivity, Einstein Telescope of the XG network, LISA, and DECIGO, $\\textit{on a single-event basis}$. These constraints on host stellar environments promise to shed light on our understanding of how CBCs form, evolve, and merge.",

Chan Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Strong gravitational lenses come in many forms, but are typically divided into two populations: galaxies, and groups and clusters of galaxies. The largest objects in the Universe (i.e. galaxy clusters) are highly irregular and composed of many components due to a history of (or active) hierarchical mergers. In this work, we analyze the discrepancies in the observables of strongly lensed gravitational wave transients in both scenarios, namely relative magnifications, time delays, and image multiplicities. We compare the detection rates between the single spherical dark matter halo models found in the literature, and publicly available state-of-the-art cluster lens models. We find there to be approximately an order of magnitude fewer detection of strongly lensed transients in the realistic model case, likely caused by their loss of overall strong lensing optical depth. We also report detection rates in the weak lensing or single-image regime. Additionally, we find a systemic shift towards lower time delays between the brightest image pairs in the cases of the realistic models, as well as higher fractions of positive versus negative parity images, which was previously reported in the literature. This deviation in the joint relative magnification factor-time delay distribution will hinder the feasibility of the reconstruction of cluster-scale lenses through gravitational wave transients alone, but can still provide a lower limit on the lens mass.",

In our analysis, the LRG1 point at $z_{\\mathrm{eff}}=0.510$ and the LRG3+ELG1 point at $z_{\\mathrm{eff}}=0.934$ are in tension with the $\\Lambda$CDM-anchored $\\Omega_m$ inferred from Planck and SNe Ia (Pantheon$^{+}$, Union3, DES-SN5YR): for LRG1 the tensions are $2.42\\sigma$, $1.91\\sigma$, $2.19\\sigma$, and $2.99\\sigma$; for LRG3+ELG1 they are $2.60\\sigma$, $2.24\\sigma$, $2.51\\sigma$, and $2.96\\sigma$. Across redshift bins DR2 shows improved agreement relative to DR1, with the $\\Omega_m$ tension dropping from $2.20\\sigma$ to $1.84\\sigma$. Nevertheless, DR2 alone is not decisive against $\\Lambda$CDM, and the apparent deviation is driven mainly by LRG1 and LRG2. In a $\\omega_0\\omega_a$CDM fit using all tracers we find a posterior mean with $w_0>-1$, consistent with dynamical dark energy and nominally challenging $\\Lambda$CDM. Removing LRG1 and/or LRG2 restores $\\Lambda$CDM concordance ($\\omega_0\\to-1$); moreover, $\\omega_0^{\\mathrm{(LRG2)}}>w_0^{\\mathrm{(LRG1)}}$, indicating that LRG2 drives the trend more strongly. Model selection via the natural-log Bayes factor $\\ln\\mathrm{BF}\\equiv\\ln(Z_{\\Lambda\\mathrm{CDM}}/Z_{\\omega_0\\omega_a\\mathrm{CDM}})$ yields weak evidence for $\\Lambda$CDM when LRG1, LRG2, or both are removed, and is inconclusive for the full sample. Hence the data do not require the extra $\\omega_a$ freedom, and the apparent $\\omega_0>-1$ preference should be interpreted cautiously as a reflection of the $\\omega_0$$\\omega_a$ degeneracy with limited per-tracer information.",

In the case of halo formation, the PS formalism suffers from the miscounting of regions collapsing into halos, known as the cloud-in-cloud problem, which is usually corrected by introducing a multiplicative `fudge factor 2'. By analogy, this factor has sometimes been applied to PBH calculations, although its validity has remained unsettled. We reformulate the PS approach for PBHs (forming during radiation-dominated epoch) within the excursion-set framework, where the smoothed density contrast undergoes a stochastic random walk as the smoothing scale varies and collapse is identified with the first threshold crossing. While the halo case is described by a Markovian process, we show that the PBH case is non-Markovian, even when the sharp-k filter Window function is adopted. Decomposing the total collapse probability into two distinct components of the stochastic motion, we numerically confirm that their contributions are exactly equal in the case of halo formation, justifying the fudge factor. For PBHs, however, we demonstrate that this equality no longer holds, and consistent inclusion of both contributions is essential to ensure a positive-definite mass function. Our results clarify the origin of the ambiguity surrounding the fudge factor and establish a robust theoretical foundation for PBH abundance calculations.",

For CMB lensing convergence auto statistics, we compare the angular power spectra ($C_\\ell$'s) to the wavelet scattering transform (WST) coefficients. For CMB lensing convergence $\\times$ galaxy weak lensing convergence statistics, we compare the cross angular power spectra to wavelet phase harmonics (WPH). This work also serves as the first application of WST and WPH to these probes. For CMB lensing convergence, we find that WST and $C_\\ell$'s yield similar constraints in forecasts for the $\\textit{Simons}$ Observatory and the South Pole Telescope. However, WST gives a tighter constraint on $\\sigma_8$ by a factor of $1.7$ for $\\textit{Planck}$ data. When CMB lensing convergence is crossed with galaxy weak lensing convergence projected from $\\textit{Euclid}$ Data Release 2 (DR2), we find that WPH outperforms cross-$C_\\ell$'s by factors between $2.4$ and $3.8$ for individual parameter constraints. To compare these different summary statistics we develop a novel learned binning approach. This method compresses summary statistics while maintaining interpretability. We find this leads to improved constraints compared to more naive binning schemes for $C_\\ell$'s, WST, and most significantly WPH. By learning the binning and measuring constraints on distinct data sets, our method is robust to overfitting by construction.",

Utilising the most recent helium reionization simulation, we generate three-dimensional maps of the 3.5cm ($8.67$ GHz) differential brightness temperature and analyze its evolution. Our results show that the volume-averaged brightness temperature declines rapidly from $\\sim 1 \\mu$K at $z = 4$ to $\\sim 2.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\mu$K by $z = 2.3$, tracing the HeII to HeIII transition driven by quasars. The power spectrum of the 3.5cm signal exhibits a scale-dependent evolution, peaking on small scales and declining as reionization progresses. We explore the cross-correlation of the 3.5cm transition line with the distribution of AGNs, which shows a transition from positive to negative correlation as ionized regions grow. We also examine the 3.5cm forest and demonstrate that absorption features persist down to $z \\sim 2.90$, even when more than $85\\%$ of HeII is ionized. Although current observational upper limits lie several orders of magnitude above theoretical predictions, future radio arrays such as $\\mathrm{SKA-mid}$ offer promising prospects. Overall, this study highlights the $^{3}\\mathrm{He}^{+}$ hyperfine transition as a sensitive tracer of the thermal and ionization history of the IGM during helium reionization.",

However, the two-dimensional cosmological projected matter density field, relevant for weak-lensing and photometric galaxy studies, is fully determined by the initial projected matter density field only at the linear order. At non-linear order, the entire volume of initial matter contributes. We study a model for the evolved projected density field that is deterministic in the initial projected density fields and probabilistic in the effects of the remaining modes in the initial conditions. We write down predictions for the mean evolved projected field model using Lagrangian perturbation theory. We run a suite of small N-body simulations with fixed projected initial conditions and measure the statistical properties of the ensemble of evolved projected fields. Measurements and theory are in good agreement and show that the information on the initial projected fields is exponentially suppresses on non-linear scales. Our model offers a potential approach to a field-level likelihood of projected fields.",

Zou Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present a measurement of the pairwise kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) signal using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Bright Galaxy Sample (BGS) Data Release 1 (DR1) galaxy sample overlapping with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) CMB temperature map. Our analysis makes use of $1.6$ million galaxies with stellar masses $\\log M_\\star/M_\\odot > 10$, and we explore measurements across a range of aperture sizes ($2.1' < \\theta_{\\rm ap} < 3.5'$) and stellar mass selections. This statistic directly probes the velocity field of the large-scale structure, a unique observable of cosmic dynamics and modified gravity. In particular, at low redshifts, this quantity is especially interesting, as deviations from General Relativity are expected to be largest. Notably, our result represents the highest-significance low-redshift ($z \\sim 0.3$) detection of the kSZ pairwise effect yet. In our most optimal configuration ($\\theta_{\\rm ap} = 3.3'$, $\\log M_\\star > 11$), we achieve a $5\\sigma$ detection. Assuming that an estimate of the optical depth and galaxy bias of the sample exists via e.g., external observables, this measurement constrains the fundamental cosmological combination $H_0 f \\sigma_8^2$. A key challenge is the degeneracy with the galaxy optical depth. We address this by combining CMB lensing, which allows us to infer the halo mass and galaxy population properties, with hydrodynamical simulation estimates of the mean optical depth, $\\bar \\tau$. We stress that this is a proof-of-concept analysis; with BGS DR2 data we expect to improve the statistical precision by roughly a factor of two, paving the way toward robust tests of modified gravity with kSZ-informed velocity-field measurements at low redshift.",

Reichardt 8 pages, 3 figures, 1 Table, submitted to PASA Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We examine the potential improvements in constraints on the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ and matter density $\\Omega_M$ from using clustering information along with number counts for future samples of thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich selected galaxy clusters. We quantify the relative improvement from including the clustering power spectrum information for three cluster sample sizes from 33,000 to 140,000 clusters and for three assumed priors on the mass slope and redshift evolution of the mass-observable relation. As expected, clustering information has the largest impact when (i) there are more clusters and (ii) the mass-observable priors are weaker. For current knowledge of the cluster mass-observable relationship, we find the addition of clustering information reduces the uncertainty on the dark energy equation of state, $\\sigma(w)$, by factors of $1.023\\pm 0.007$ to $1.0790\\pm 0.011$, with larger improvements observed with more clusters. Clustering information is more important for the matter density, with $\\sigma(\\Omega_M)$ reduced by factors of $1.068 \\pm 007$ to $1.145 \\pm 0.012$. The improvement in $w$ constraints from adding clustering information largely vanishes after tightening priors on the mass-observable relationship by a factor of two. For weaker priors, we find clustering information improves the determination of the cluster mass slope and redshift evolution by factors of $1.389 \\pm 0.041$ and $1.340 \\pm 0.039$ respectively. These findings highlight that, with the anticipated surge in cluster detections from next generation surveys, self-calibration through clustering information will provide an independent cross-check on the mass slope and redshift evolution of the mass-observable relationship as well as enhancing the precision achievable from cluster cosmology.",

However, comparing observationally inferred SHMFs to theoretical predictions remains challenging, as the predicted SHMF can vary significantly between galaxies - even within the same cosmological model - due to differences in the properties and environment of individual galaxies. We present a machine learning framework to infer the galaxy-specific predicted SHMF from galaxy images, conditioned on the assumed inverse warm DM particle mass $M^{-1}_{\\rm DM}$. To train the model, we use 1024 high-resolution hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations from the DREAMS suite. Mock observations are generated using Synthesizer, excluding gas particle contributions, and SHMFs are computed with the Rockstar halo finder. Our neural network takes as input both the galaxy images and the inverse DM mass. This method enables scalable, image-based predictions for the theoretical DM SHMFs of individual galaxies, facilitating direct comparisons with observational measurements.",

Previous studies have forecasted stringent constraints on energy injections from exotic sources that heat, excite, and ionize the background gas and thereby modify the 21-cm signal. In this work, we quantify the substantial impact that astrophysical uncertainties have on the projected sensitivity to exotic energy injection. In particular, there are significant uncertainties in the minimum star-forming dark matter halo mass, the Lyman-$\\alpha$ emission, and the X-ray emission, whose values characterize the fiducial astrophysical model when projecting bounds. As a case study, we investigate the energy injection of accreting primordial black holes of mass $\\sim 1~M_\\odot-10^3~M_\\odot$, also taking into account uncertainties in the accretion model. We show that, depending on the chosen fiducial model and accretion uncertainties, the sensitivity of future 21-cm data could constrain the abundance of primordial black holes to be either slightly stronger, or significantly weaker, than current limits from the Cosmic Microwave Background.",

While accurate $N$-body emulators exist to model the matter power spectrum for $\\Lambda$CDM and some limited extensions, it's unfeasible to generate $N$-body simulation suites for all candidate models. Motivated by recent hints of an evolving dark energy equation of state, we assess the viability of employing the COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) method to generate simulation suites for the $w_0w_a$ dark energy model. We combine COLA simulations with an existing high-precision $\\Lambda$CDM emulator to extend its predictions into new regions of parameter space. We assess the precision of our emulator at the level of the matter power spectrum, finding that our emulator can reproduce the nonlinear boosts from EuclidEmulator2 at less than $2\\%$ error. Moreover, we perform an analysis of a simulated cosmic shear survey akin to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) first year of observations, assessing the differences in parameter constraints between our COLA-based emulator and the benchmark emulator. We find our emulator to be in excellent agreement with the benchmark, achieving less than $0.3\\sigma$ shifts in cosmological parameters. We compare our emulator's performance to a commonly used approach: assuming the $\\Lambda$CDM boost can be employed for extended parameter spaces without modification. We find that our emulator yields a significantly smaller $\\Delta\\chi^2$ distribution, parameter constraint biases, and a more accurate figure of merit compared to this second approach. Our results demonstrate that COLA emulators provide a computationally efficient path forward for modeling nonlinear structure in extended cosmologies, offering a practical alternative to full $N$-body suites.",

A normal axion dark energy component in the mass range just below the Hubble scale can mimic a phantom component by appearing as dark energy at $z=1$ and dark matter at $z=0$, raising the possibility of a phantom mirage. We show that there is a wide range of axion dark energy contributions that can resolve the SN-BAO tension as well as thawing quintessence does, leaving BAO tension with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) for the distance measures from $z\\sim 1$ to recombination to be resolved at high redshifts.

Hickox 28 pages, 12 figures, submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Understanding the dark matter (DM) halo environment in which galaxies that host active galactic nuclei (AGN) reside is a window into the nature of supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion. We apply halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling tools to interpret the angular cross-correlation functions between $1.5\\times10^6$ luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and our $\\sim28,500$ Hyper Suprime-Cam + Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer-selected (and $L_{6 \\mu m}$-limited) AGN to infer the halo properties of distinct quasar samples at physical scales $s>0.1\\,{\\rm Mpc}$, for $z\\in0.7-1.0$. We find that Type I (unobscured) and Type II (obscured) AGN cluster differently, both on small and large physical scales. The derived HODs imply that Type I AGN reside, on average, in substantially ($\\sim3\\times$) more massive halos ($M_h \\sim 10^{13.4} M_\\odot$) than Type II AGN ($M_h \\sim 10^{12.9} M_\\odot$) at $>5\\sigma$ significance. While Type II AGN show one-halo correlations similar to that of galaxies of their average halo mass, the Type I AGN intra-halo clustering signal is significantly shallower. We interpret this observation with HOD methods and find Type I AGN are significantly less likely ($f_{sat}\\sim0.05^{+1}_{-0.05}\\%$) to be found in satellite galaxies than Type II AGN. We find reddened + obscured AGN to have typical satellite fractions for their inferred average halo mass ($\\sim10^{13} M_\\odot$), with $f_{sat} \\sim 20^{+10}_{-5}\\%$. Taken together, these results pose a significant challenge to the strict unified AGN morphological model, and instead suggest that a quasar's spectral class is strongly correlated with its host galaxy's dark matter halo environment. These intriguing results have provided a more complex picture of the SMBH -- DM halo connection, and motivate future analyses of the intrinsic galaxy and accretion properties of AGN.",

By leveraging the representational power of deep neural networks, SBI can extract the most informative simulation features for the parameters of interest. Sequential SBI methods extend this approach by iteratively steering the simulation process towards the most relevant regions of parameter space. This is typically implemented through an algorithmic structure, in which simulation and network training alternate over multiple rounds. This strategy is particularly well suited for high-precision inference in high-dimensional settings, which are commonplace in physics applications with growing data volumes and increasing model fidelity. Here, we introduce dynamic SBI, which implements the core ideas of sequential methods in a round-free, asynchronous, and highly parallelisable manner. At its core is an adaptive dataset that is iteratively transformed during inference to resemble the target observation. Simulation and training proceed in parallel: trained networks are used both to filter out simulations incompatible with the data and to propose new, more promising ones. Compared to round-based sequential methods, this asynchronous structure can significantly reduce simulation costs and training overhead. We demonstrate that dynamic SBI achieves significant improvements in simulation and training efficiency while maintaining inference performance. We further validate our framework on two challenging astrophysical inference tasks: characterising the stochastic gravitational wave background and analysing strong gravitational lensing systems. Overall, this work presents a flexible and efficient new paradigm for sequential SBI.",

Hopkins, Charles Romero, Brian Mason, John Orlowski-Scherer, Craig L. Sarazin 15 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We explore the possibility that inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of cosmic microwave background photons by $\\sim$GeV cosmic rays (CRs) injected by the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) in cool core (CC) clusters produces a non-negligible continuum-like X-ray signal that is easily misinterpreted as intracluster medium (ICM) thermal bremsstrahlung continuum. This is particularly relevant to the cooling flow problem--the lack of star formation relative to X-ray-inferred ICM cooling rates. Using ZwCl 3146, a relaxed CC system at $z = 0.291$, we compare pressure profiles derived via X-rays and the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. While SZ measurements probe only thermal ICM electrons, additional CR-IC emission would appear to boost the X-ray-inferred pressure. Relative to unity, we measure a $\\simeq30\\%$ decrement in $P_{SZ}/P_X$ within 100 kpc of the ZwCl 3146 center at a statistical significance of $\\simeq 3.3\\sigma$, consistent with predicted deficits from CR-IC contamination in reasonable models of central AGN-driven CR injection. X-ray spectral fits of a two-component model with thermal ICM and CR-IC emission are consistent with CR-IC as the cause of this deficit. We test alternative explanations and systematics that could drive such a decrement, with the leading order systematics associated with halo triaxiality. Collectively, these systematics are unlikely to produce a $P_{SZ}/P_X$ decrement $\\gtrsim10\\%$. While our results establish that non-negligible CR-IC emission is plausible in ZwCl 3146, we stress that more detailed studies of larger cluster samples are required to robustly assess whether CR-IC is relevant to the cooling flow problem.",

We consider three different reionization histories, which we can distinguish with a total of $\\lesssim 1000\\,{\\rm DM}$ measurements during EoR if their redshifts are known. We note that the redshift derivatives of ${\\rm DM}$ are also directly sensitive to the reionization history. The major point of this work is to explore the variance in the ${\\rm DM}$ measurements and the information encoded in them. We find that the all-sky average $\\overline{\\rm DM}(z)$ gets biased from the line-of-sight (LoS) fluctuations in the ${\\rm DM}$ measurements introduced by the ionization of IGM during EoR. We find that the ratio $\\sigma_{\\rm DM}/\\overline{\\rm DM}$ depends directly on the ionization bubble sizes as well as the reionization history. On the other hand, we also find that angular variance (coined as $\\textit{structure function}$) of ${\\rm DM}$ encodes the information about the duration of reionization and the typical bubble sizes as well. We establish the usefulness of variances in ${\\rm DM}$ using toy models of reionization and later verify it with the realistic reionization simulations.",

The LCS can, in principle, constrain the reionization model and history by quantifying the morphology of neutral hydrogen\\,(\\HI) distribution during the different stages of the EoR. Specifically, the percolation transition of ionized regions, quantified and constrained via LCS, provides a crucial insight about the underlying reionization model. The previous LCS analysis of EoR 21\\,cm maps demonstrates that the convolution of the synthesized beam of the radio interferometric arrays, e.g. SKA1-Low with the target signal, shifts the apparent percolation transition of ionized regions towards the lower redshifts. In this study, we present an optimal thresholding strategy to reduce this bias in the recovered percolation transition. We assess the robustness of LCS analysis of the 21\\,cm maps, considering the effects of antenna-based gain calibration errors and instrumental noise for SKA1-Low. This analysis is performed using synthetic observations simulated by the \\textsc{21cmE2E} pipeline, considering SKA1-Low AA4 configuration within a radius of 2\\,km from the array centre. Our findings suggest that a minimum of $2000$\\,hours of observation (SNR $\\gtrapprox 3$) are required for the LCS analysis to credibly suppress the confusion introduced by thermal noise. Further, we also demonstrate that for a maximum antenna-based calibration error tolerance of $\\sim 0.02\\%$ (post calibration), the reionization history can be recovered in a robust and relatively unbiased manner using the LCS.",

In this work, we explore the generic multi-axion scenario motivated in the String Axiverse context and investigate its astronomical implications in both the linear and nonlinear regimes. In the linear regime, we provide a simplified prescription for multi-copy axion transfer functions, and introduce the notion of effective mass ($m_{eff}^{-2}=\\sum_i w_i m_i^{-2}$ with $\\{ w_i\\}$ being fractional contributions of different copies to cosmic matter density) that governs the suppression to Large Scale Structure (LSS), including the turnover scale of the galaxy luminosity function (LF). On galactic scales, individual copies decouple from the collective behavior seen for LSS, leading to different galaxy groups each dominated by different copies (Pozo et al. 2025). This explains the preference for $\\sim 10^{-22}$eV axions from local, galactic scale observation despite stringent mass constraints set by existing UV LF turnover searches. In the non-linear regime within galaxy halos, we show that similar notion of effective masses or de Broglie scales govern the collective wave interference, influencing the net stellar heating rates and the substructure-induced spread of JWST transients near critical curves. Distinctive to the multi-copy scenario, the effective mass within galaxy halos is generically anticipated to be radially decreasing following the stronger concentration of heavier copies to the galactic center. Such a spatial variation leads to radially increasing spreading scales for micro-lensed transients at different radial positions, a signature that may be tested with future JWST lensing observations.",

Since the estimator is agnostic to sampling strategy and simply requires posterior samples, it can be applied to compute the evidence using any Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling technique, including saved down MCMC chains, or any variational inference approach. The learned harmonic mean estimator was recently introduced, where machine learning techniques were developed to learn a suitable internal importance sampling target distribution to solve the issue of exploding variance of the original harmonic mean estimator. In this article we present the use of normalizing flows as the internal machine learning technique within the learned harmonic mean estimator. Normalizing flows can be elegantly coupled with the learned harmonic mean to provide an approach that is more robust, flexible and scalable than the machine learning models considered previously. We perform a series of numerical experiments, applying our method to benchmark problems and to a cosmological example in up to 21 dimensions. We find the learned harmonic mean estimator is in agreement with ground truth values and nested sampling estimates. The open-source harmonic Python package implementing the learned harmonic mean, now with normalizing flows included, is publicly available.",

However, as we lack a comprehensive model able to explain it, its investigation still relies on observational efforts. This work focuses on optically selected quasars detected by eROSITA. We present the properties of the sources collected in the eROSITA early data release (eFEDS) and those resulting from the first six months of eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS1). We focus on the subset of quasars bright enough in the optical/UV band to avoid an ''Eddington bias'' towards X-ray brighter-than-average spectral energy distributions. The final samples include 1,248 and 519 sources for eFEDS and eRASS1, up to redshift $z\\approx3$ and $z\\approx1.5$, respectively. We found that the X-ray$-$UV luminosity relation shows no significant evolution with redshift, and its slope is in perfect agreement with previous compilations of quasar samples. The intrinsic dispersion of the relation is about 0.2 dex, which is small enough for possible cosmological applications. However, the limited redshift range and statistics of the current samples do not allow us to obtain significant cosmological constraints yet. We show how this is going to change with the future releases of the eROSITA data.",

We argue that this is the first object to agree with three key theoretical predictions for Pop III stars: (1) formation in extremely low-metallicity halos with virial temperatures ranging from $T_{\\rm vir}\\sim 10^3-10^4~{\\rm K}$, (2) a top-heavy initial mass function, and (3) formation of low-mass clusters with ${\\sim}{\\rm a ~few}\\times 1000~M_\\odot$ in massive Pop III stars. LAP1-B is consistent with recently formed Pop III stars hosted in a $\\sim 5\\times 10^7~M_\\odot$ dark matter halo, some of which have enriched their surrounding gas either with supernovae or stellar winds. We use the semi-analytic model of Visbal et al. (2020) to predict the abundance of Pop III clusters observable at the high magnification provided by the foreground galaxy cluster MACS J0416. Using fiducial parameters unmodified from previous work, we expect about one observable Pop III galaxy similar to LAP1-B in the range $z=6-7$. At earlier times, the intrinsic abundance is higher, but Pop III systems would not have been detected because of their increased luminosity distance and lower mass dark matter halos, which would host fewer stars. Thus, we find that LAP1-B was found at the redshift theoretically expected, given current observable limits, despite the fact that most Pop III systems form much earlier.",

Comment Welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) We investigate magnetic-field amplification driven by the nonresonant hybrid (NRH or Bell) instability and its impact on cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration at reverse shocks of ultrafast outflows (UFOs) from active galactic nuclei (AGN). Previous kinetic studies by particle-in-cell simulations have demonstrated that when maximum CR energy is near the injection scale, NRH instability efficiently amplifies magnetic field up to the saturation level. However, the efficiency of NRH instability goes down as maximum energy increase since CR current is carried by escaping CRs near the maximum energy. We employ a one-dimensional MHD--CR framework solving telegraph-type diffusion--convection equations to trace the coupled evolution of CRs, magnetic fields, and shock dynamics under realistic parameters. We find a distinct transition with magnetic field strength: for weak background fields ($B_{0}\\!\\lesssim\\!10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{G}$), NRH instability efficiently amplifies upstream turbulence, driving a self-regulated state where $E_{\\max}$ becomes independent of initial strength of magnetic turbulence. In contrast, for stronger background fields ($B_{0}\\!\\gtrsim\\!10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{G}$), the escaping CR current is too weak to drive NRH instability, and magnetic turbulence further decays through parametric instabilities, potentially reducing the acceleration efficiency. We give the physical interpretation for the transition and discuss conditions for PeV--EeV acceleration at UFO reverse shocks.",

Submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a global three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulation of a circumbinary disk (CBD) around a massive black hole binary (MBHB) with a total mass $2 \\times 10^7\\,M_{\\odot}$ and mass ratio $0.1$, separated by $100\\, GM_{\\rm tot}/c^2$. The inclusion of radiation makes the disk thinner, denser, less eccentric at the inner edge, and more filamentary when compared to an otherwise identical locally isothermal MHD disk. The RMHD disk has accretion rate $\\sim 0.23\\,\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{Edd}}$ and produces thermal emission peaking in the near-UV/optical with a luminosity of $\\sim 1\\, \\% L_{\\rm {Edd }}$. Compared with an equal-mass binary with the same total mass, the thermal emission of the CBD around the unequal-mass binary is several orders of magnitude brighter and much more variable at far-UV/soft X-rays frequencies. Similarly, we find that the light curve associated with the $0.1$ mass ratio binary exhibits dominant periodicity corresponding to 2 binary orbits, compared to the equal-mass binary that shows periodicity at 2.5-5 binary orbits. Our results highlight the importance of radiation for the structure and observational properties of MBHB circumbinary disks and have implications for detecting electromagnetic counterparts to LISA gravitational wave precursors and for the heavier binaries targeted by the Pulsar Timing Arrays.",

      "abstract": "Investigating Nonlinear Landau Damping in Hybrid Simulations Benedikt Schroer, Damiano Caprioli, Pasquale Blasi submitted to PRD, comments welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Phenomenological studies of cosmic-ray self-confinement often hinge on the linear theory for the growth rate of the streaming instability and for the damping rate of the generated magnetic modes. Largely different expressions exist, especially for the rate of nonlinear Landau damping, which is often assumed to be the most important damping mechanism in warm ionized plasmas. Using hybrid-PIC simulations in the resonant streaming instability regime, we present a comprehensive assessment of nonlinear Landau damping and show that the damping rate at a given scale depends on the power in magnetic fields on larger scales. Furthermore, we find that an inverse cascade develops, which produces magnetic fields on scales larger than the resonant ones. Here we extend previous results obtained for a mono-energetic distribution of non-thermal particles to the case of broader CR distributions, as a first step towards developing phenomenological models. Pre-existing turbulence of Alfvénic nature at large scales severely affects the damping of waves produced by low-energy CRs; depending on its amplitude, such a turbulence may inhibit the growth of streaming instability so that CRs are either self-confined at all energies or not at all.",

Over the years, a large number of analytical and numerical works has been devoted to understanding the intricacies of their complex dynamics, with most of these past studies performed in the ideal MHD regime. We propose a self-similar formalism, based on the expansion of the equations of resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, for the description of these outflows in the vicinity of their symmetry axis and present semi-analytical solutions describing strongly relativistic jets in both the ideal and resistive MHD regimes. Our solutions provide a clear picture of the impact of electromagnetic dissipation on the acceleration and collimation mechanisms which determine the kinetic and morphological characteristics of these relativistic outflows. The resistive MHD solutions are compared to their ideal MHD counterparts, revealing the key differences between the two regimes.

Accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) IGR J17091-3624 is the only black hole X-ray binary candidate, aside from the well-studied black hole system GRS 1915+105, observed to exhibit a wide range of structured variability patterns in its light curves. In 2025, the source underwent a ``failed'' outburst: it brightened in the hard state but did not transition to the soft state before returning to quiescence within a few weeks. During this period, IGR J17091-3624 was observed by multiple ground- and space-based facilities. Here, we present results from six pointed NuSTAR observations obtained during the outburst. None of the NuSTAR light curves showed the exotic variability classes typical of the soft state in this source; however, we detected, for the first time, strong dips in the count rate during one epoch, with a total duration of $\\sim4\\,\\mathrm{ks}$ as seen by NuSTAR. Through spectral and timing analysis of all six epochs, we investigate the hard-state spectral evolution and the nature of the dips. A clear evolution of the coronal properties with luminosity is observed over all six epochs, with clear signatures of relativistic disk reflection which remain largely unchanged across the first five epochs. The first five epochs also show a strong and stable quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) feature in the power spectra. The dips observed in Epoch 5 are consistent with partial obscuration by ionized material with a column density $N_{\\mathrm{H}} \\approx 2.0 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. We discuss possible origins for this material and place constraints on the orbital parameters and distance of the system.",

The dimensionless spins of the more massive (primary) and less massive (secondary) black holes are measured to be $\\chi_1 = 0.90^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and $\\chi_2 = 0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.51}$ ($90\\%$ credible intervals), respectively. Its large mass and extremal spins are challenging to explain through standard binary stellar physics, though a flurry of hypothetical scenarios have been proposed. Hierarchical assembly -- i.e., mergers of black holes that are themselves formed from previous generations of mergers -- is generally a promising way to explain massive and rapidly spinning black holes. Here, we investigate the possibility that both GW231123 was assembled hierarchically in a dense star cluster as the merger of two second-generation black holes. Taking the inferred spin values at face value, we find that it is possible, though unlikely ($p\\lesssim 1\\%$), that a compact binary with both component spins like GW231123 could form in a cluster from hierarchical assembly.",

X-ray light curves of unabsorbed AGN show dramatic random variability on timescales ranging from seconds to years. The power spectrum of the fluctuations is usually well-modelled with a power law that decays as $1/f$ at low frequencies, and which bends to $1/f^{2-3}$ at high frequencies. The timescale associated with the bend correlates well with the mass of the black hole and may also correlate with bolometric luminosity in the `X-ray variability plane'. Because AGN light curves are usually irregularly sampled, the estimation of AGN power spectra is challenging. In a previous paper, we introduced a new method to estimate the parameters of bending power law power spectra from AGN light curves. We apply this method to a sample of 56 variable and unabsorbed AGN, observed with XMM-Newton and Swift in the $0.3-1.5$ keV band over the past two decades. We obtain estimates of the bends in 50 sources, which is the largest sample of X-ray bends in the soft band. We also find that the high-frequency power spectrum is often steeper than 2. We update the X-ray variability plane with new bend timescale measurements spanning from 7 min to 62 days. We report the detections of low-frequency bends in the power spectra of five AGN, three of which are previously unpublished: 1H 1934-063, Mkn 766 and Mkn 279.",

They have also been advocated as tracers of reacceleration or gas inhomogeneities during their transport. The number of EC-unstable species grows with mass, with an expected EC-decay impact more important for larger atomic number and lower energy. We revisit the modelling of EC decay and its detectability in the context of recent unmodulated low-energy (Voyager) and high-precision data for heavy (AMS-02) and very-heavy nuclei (ACE-CRIS, CALET and Super-TIGER). We solve the transport equation for a multi-level configuration (up to any number of electrons attached) in the diffusion and leaky-box models. Their decayed fractions are found to be qualitatively similar but with very different absolute fluxes. We check that the standard two-level approximation, wherein the cosmic-ray nucleus is fully ionised or with one electron attached, is sufficient for most situations. We find that the impact of EC-decay is negligible in current data, except possibly for fluxes or ratios involving $^{51}$Cr, $^{55}$Fe, and Co. These conclusions are robust against significant uncertainties in the attachment and stripping cross-sections. This first analysis calls for further investigation, as several forthcoming projects (e.g., TIGERISS) are targeting $Z>30$ cosmic rays.",

Most studies argue that these afterglows may arise from forward shocks (FS) produced by the interaction between the TDE outflow and the hot, diffuse circumnuclear medium (CNM). Current theoretical models do not model the evolution of relativistic electrons in space, which introduces uncertainties. Here we conducted hydrodynamic simulations to study the hydrodynamic evolution of relativistic electrons, and calculated the synchrotron spectra via radiative transfer. We focus on the FS scenario with non-relativistic outflows, and various parameters of the outflow and CNM are explored. A moderate outflow with kinetic energy of several $10^{50}$ erg in a Galactic center - like CNM can produce mJy-level radio afterglows at a distance of 100 Mpc. The self-absorption frequency exhibits a slow decline at early times and a rapid decrease at late times. We derived the temporal evolution of the high-frequency radio flux, revealing its characteristic rise and decline pattern. We also find that: (1) the radio spectra for narrow outflows are clearly anisotropic along different sight lines; (2) the FS parameters inferred from radio spectra using conventional analytical formulas deviate significantly from those in simulations, in which the inferred shock radii are half of those from simulations, and the inferred energies are an order of magnitude lower.",

Submitted to PRD High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) GRB 230307A is one of the brightest long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) ever detected, yet its progenitor remains uncertain due to the variety of plausible astrophysical scenarios. In this work, we investigate four possible progenitors for GRB 230307A: a binary neutron star (BNS), a neutron star--white dwarf (NS--WD) system, a neutron star--black hole (NS--BH) merger, and a tidal disruption event (TDE) involving a white dwarf and a supermassive black hole. Additionally, we explore three distinct central engine models powering the kilonova associated with the BNS: radioactive decay of $r$-process nuclei in a two-component ejecta model, a magnetar-driven model including magnetic dipole spin-down, and a combined model of magnetar spin-down with ${}^{56}$Ni radioactive decay. We perform Bayesian multi-wavelength light-curve analyses using physically motivated models and priors, and evaluate model performance through Bayes factors and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) scores. Our results show a statistical preference for a BNS or NS--WD progenitor producing a kilonova powered by a magnetar and ${}^{56}$Ni decay, characterized by a ${}^{56}$Ni mass of $\\sim4\\times10^{-4}\\,M_{\\odot}$ and an ejecta mass of $0.06\\,M_{\\odot}$. Furthermore, under the assumption of a BNS origin within this model, we infer binary component masses of $m_{1} = 1.81^{+0.46}_{-0.61}\\,M_{\\odot}$ and $m_{2} = 1.61^{+0.65}_{-0.41}\\,M_{\\odot}$, with a dimensionless tidal deformability of $\\tilde{\\Lambda} = 471^{+318}_{-395}$. From the component mass posteriors, we infer that the observed offset can be explained by a natal kick as long as the systemic velocity is nearly aligned with the pre-kick orbital motion. In this case, the required kick velocity (co-moving frame) and binary separation range within $v'_{\\mathrm{k}}\\sim100$--$150~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$, and $a_0\\sim2$--$3~R_{\\odot}$, respectively.",

We find that these gamma-ray outflows are present in all three Milky-Way mass simulated galaxies. The amplitude, shape, and the composition of the gamma-ray spectrum of these bubbles fluctuates over time, with lepton-dominated and hadron-dominated phases. Spectra in which there is O(1) more gamma-ray flux from inverse Compton scattering than neutral pion decay are a good fit to the measured Fermi-LAT spectrum. Additionally, these simulations predict multi-wavelength features in soft x-rays and synchrotron radio, potentially providing new observational signatures that can connect the circumgalactic medium to cosmic ray physics and activity in the galactic center.",

In this paper, we present X-ray observations of the SS433/W50 complex by the eROSITA telescope onboard the SRG space observatory. These data provide images of the entire nebula characterized by a very large dynamic range and allow spectral analysis of the diffuse X-ray emission. In particular, these data illustrate a close connection between the thermal and non-thermal components of W50 on scales ranging from sub-parsecs, represented by narrow X-ray bright filaments, to the entire extent $\\gtrsim 100\\,{\\rm pc}$ of the nebula. These data also allow us to fully characterize a pair of nearly symmetric, sharp-edged, elongated structures aligned with the orbital axis of the binary system, which lack radio counterparts, but are prominent in very high energy gamma-ray emission. The resulting multifaceted picture of the interaction between energetic outflows and the surrounding medium paves the way for future focused multiwavelength observations and dedicated numerical simulations.",

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Many state-of-the-art galaxy simulations featuring traditional feedback modes have significant challenges producing enough extended soft X-ray ($\\sim 0.5-2$ keV) emission at R $\\sim 0.5-1$ R$_{\\rm vir}$ observed around galaxies with stellar masses M$_{\\rm \\ast} \\lesssim 10^{11} \\rm M_\\odot$, without violating galaxy mass function constraints. Moreover, thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) measurements probing the thermal pressure of similar galaxies indicate it is orders-of-magnitude lower than predictions from simple halo hydrodynamics and many hydrodynamical simulations. We demonstrate that these constraints can be met congruously with a large non-thermal pressure contribution in the form of cosmic rays (CRs) from SNe and/or AGN, which lowers the tSZ signal while CR leptons produce plentiful soft X-rays via inverse Compton scattering of the CMB. The combination of these two observations is far more constraining on the pressure budget of galactic halos than either alone -- if these novel tSZ and X-ray observations are borne out by future studies, then taken together they reveal \\textit{the strongest evidence for CR support in halos to date}. Conversely, it is very difficult to produce the extended X-rays via traditional thermal emission without increasing the overall thermal pressure and thus tSZ signal in tandem, making these tensions even worse. Finally, tSZ \\& X-rays together unlock a novel observational method to constrain halo CR pressure relative to thermal pressure, with implications for CR transport parameters and AGN feedback energetics across various galaxy mass scales. Taking the currently observed constraints at M$_{\\rm halo} \\sim 10^{\\rm 12} \\rm M_\\odot$ imply the halo CR pressure must at least be equal to the gas thermal pressure.",

Rubin Observatory are projected to annually discover millions of astronomical transients. This and complementary programs demand fast, automated methods to constrain the physical properties of the most interesting objects for spectroscopic follow up. Traditional approaches to likelihood-based inference are computationally expensive and ignore the multi-component energy sources powering astrophysical phenomena. In this work, we present a hierarchical simulation-based inference model for multi-band light curves that 1) identifies the energy sources powering an event of interest, 2) infers the physical properties of each subclass, and 3) separates physical anomalies in the learned embedding space. Our architecture consists of a transformer-based light curve summarizer coupled to a flow-matching regression module and a categorical classifier for the physical components. We train and test our model on $\\sim$150k synthetic light curves generated with $\\texttt{MOSFiT}$. Our network achieves a 90% classification accuracy at identifying energy sources, yields well-calibrated posteriors for all active components, and detects rare anomalies such as tidal disruption events (TDEs) through the learned latent space. This work demonstrates a scalable joint framework for population studies of known transients and the discovery of novel populations in the era of Rubin.",

The Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) detected a flare on Algol at 05:52 UT on 2018 July 4. Subsequently, we carried out a prompt X-ray monitoring with the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) starting at 19:45 UT on the same day, and the observation ended at 06:02 UT on 2018 July 6. During the decaying phase of the flare, we successfully detected a 5.8-hour-long eclipse, corresponding to the secondary eclipse in which Algol A blocks the line of sight to Algol B. During the eclipse, the 2--10 keV X-ray flux is decreased to 20\\% level from $1.9\\times10^{-10}~ \\mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1} }$ to $4.5\\times10^{-11}~ \\mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1} }$. We found a configuration of the flare size and location to explain the X-ray observations; e.g., the flare occurred at the latitude 45°S of the Algol B surface with a flare height of $1.9\\times10^{11}~\\mathrm{cm}$, corresponding to 0.8 times the stellar radius of Algol B, giving 80% obscuration of the flare loop by Algol A.

For an interactive 3D visualization of the circumstellar material around the star (works both on phones and laptops), see this https URL Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Recent observations have revealed a surprisingly large fraction of hydrogen-rich supernovae (SNe) interacting with dense confined circumstellar material (CSM), whose origin is heavily debated. Exploiting our recent implementation of a sophisticated radiation transport scheme in the moving-mesh code AREPO, we perform full-sphere 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulations of red supergiant envelopes. For $10\\, M_\\odot$ and $20\\, M_\\odot$ core-carbon-burning stars, we find that large-amplitude radial pulsations lift the surface material of density $10^{-14}$-$10^{-12}\\; \\mathrm{g\\; cm^{-3}}$ to the circumstellar environment up to $3\\times10^{14}$ cm, consistent with the inferred density for the interacting SN 2013fs. There, radiation acts on dust to drive highly anisotropic outflows of $10^{-6}$-$10^{-5}\\, M_\\odot\\, \\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$. The total CSM masses for both simulations are $\\sim 0.01\\, M_\\odot$. Due to convection, the CSM density structure has order-of-magnitude angular variations, dominated by large-scale asymmetries. We suggest that (1) the CSM around the progenitor is bound material instead of a widely-assumed steady wind, (2) highly aspherical CSM is common and can be created by surface convection rather than only from binary interactions, and (3) 3D effects need to be incorporated in 1D SN modeling, potentially via effective clumping. Based on our simulations, we propose a 1D analytical CSM model to be directly used for SN observable modeling. We predict that progenitor pulsations (seen in SN 2023ixf) and highly-confined CSM (seen in SN 2013fs) should be common among most hydrogen-rich SNe. This can be tested with progenitor monitoring using Rubin Observatory and near-future high-cadence surveys such as ULTRASAT and UVEX.",

Tsygankov 9 pages, 7 figures. Accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) X-ray polarimetry of accreting compact objects has revealed fast time variations in the polarization angle (PA), suggesting that the geometry and/or optical depth of the Comptonization region is changing rapidly. This prompts investigations into how fast such variability can be. Conventionally, the data are often binned to examine the time variability such that the measurement in each bin is above the minimum detectable polarization (MDP). Here we demonstrate that this is unnecessary, and even below the MDP, one can infer the posterior distribution of PA reliably using the Bayesian approach and still be able to place useful constraints on the physics in many cases, due to small relative uncertainties on PA (e.g., $\\Delta$PA $\\approx$ 10--30$^\\circ$ compared with a dynamical range of 180$^\\circ$). With this approach, we discovered that the PA variation in one of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observations of GX 13+1 is not following a linear rotation mode as suggested previously. Instead, the PA swings between two discrete angles, suggesting that there are two emitting components, e.g., the boundary layer and the spreading layer, competing with each other. In XTE J1701-462, we confirmed previous results for a variable PA in the normal branch, and furthermore, revealed that the variation timescale could be as short as 1.5 hours. During the IXPE observation of Sco X-1, a hint is found for the PA in the highest flux level to be different from the average but consistent with previous measurement results with PolarLight and OSO-8.",

However, theoretical models of neutrino flavor change that include many-body quantum correlations can differ starkly from similar mean-field calculations. We demonstrate for the first time that the inhomogeneous fast flavor instability is disrupted by many-body correlations using a novel tensor network framework that allows a continuous transition between mean-field and many-body results by tuning the singular value decomposition cutoff value. Generalizing the forward-scattering Hamiltonian to spatially varying conditions, we demonstrate that the timescale of flavor transformation scales logarithmically with system size, suggesting that many-body effects could occur before mean-field instabilities are able to saturate.

Ajello 8 pages, 3 figures, 1 table; Accepted by A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Blazars are a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that emit non-thermal radiation through relativistic jets, characterized by rapid flux and polarization variability. High synchrotron-peaked blazars (HSPs) and extreme high synchrotron-peaked blazars (EHSPs), with synchrotron peaks exceeding $10^{15}$ Hz and $10^{17}$ Hz, respectively, are crucial for understanding the full range of blazar phenomena and testing models of jet physics. Yet, their understanding remains challenging. This work aims to systematically identify and characterize the most extreme $\\gamma$-ray blazars using data from the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The focus is on spectral hardening, where the $\\gamma$-ray spectrum becomes harder at higher energies, particularly during flaring episodes. This represents the first dedicated analysis of spectral hardening across a population of EHSPs, as previous studies explored it only in individual sources. We analyze 138 blazars selected from the 4FGL-DR2 catalog with high synchrotron peak frequencies and well-sampled light curves. Flaring periods are automatically identified, and each flare is analyzed, with the significance of spectral hardening assessed through a test statistic based on the likelihood ratio of two spectral models. We identify two flaring episodes with indications of spectral hardening, in 4FGL J0238.4$-$3116 and PKS 2155$-$304, the latter detected independently by both methods but referring to the same period. These events are consistent with expectations from statistical fluctuations, suggesting that spectral hardening is a rare occurrence (< 0.1 %). These results constrain its frequency and support a smoothly varying power-law blazar emission model, motivating future multi-wavelength studies to clarify whether these rare flares reflect distinct physical processes within blazar jets.",

Full dataset available on GitHub and Zenodo High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present multi-wavelength observations of the type II supernova (SN II) 2023ixf during its first two years of evolution. We combine ground-based optical/NIR spectroscopy with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) far- and near-ultraviolet spectroscopy and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) near- and mid-infrared photometry and spectroscopy to create spectral energy distributions of SN 2023ixf at +374 and +620 days post-explosion, covering a wavelength range of ~0.1-30 $\\mu$m. The multi-band light curve of SN 2023ixf follows a standard radioactive decay decline rate after the plateau until ~500 days, at which point shock powered emission from ongoing interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM) begins to dominate. This evolution is temporally consistent with 0.3-10 keV X-ray detections of SN 2023ixf and broad ''boxy'' spectral line emission from reprocessing of shock luminosity in a cold dense shell located between forward and reverse shocks. Using the expected absorbed radioactive decay power and the detected X-ray luminosity, we quantify the total shock powered emission at the +374 and +620 day epochs and find that it can be explained by nearly complete thermalization of the reverse shock luminosity as SN 2023ixf interacts with a continuous, ''wind-like'' CSM with a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\\dot M \\approx 10^{-4}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($v_w = 20 \\pm 5$ km/s). Additionally, we construct multi-epoch spectral models from the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN, which contain radioactive decay and shock powers, as well as dust absorption, scattering, and emission. We find that models with shock powers of $L_{sh} = (0.5-1) \\times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and $(0.5 - 1) \\times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\\odot}$ of silicate dust in the cold dense shell and/or inner SN ejecta can effectively reproduce the global properties of the late-time (>300 days) UV-to-IR spectra of SN 2023ixf.",

Several models of nuclear equation of state (EOS) are constructed with varying saturation parameters, particularly the symmetry energy $S_0$ and its density slope $L$. Using the Thomas--Fermi approximation, the mass and proton numbers of heavy nuclei at subnuclear densities are systematically evaluated, along with their dependence on the EOS. Cooling simulations of protoneutron stars reveal that EOSs with smaller $L$ values lead to a longer cooling timescale and higher average neutrino energies. This behavior is attributed to the enhanced neutrino scattering caused by larger mass numbers, which increases the thermal insulation. Furthermore, the crystallization temperature, marking the onset of crust formation, is found to be higher for EOSs with smaller values of $L$. This is due to the enhanced Coulomb energy associated with larger proton numbers. As a result, despite slower cooling, crust formation occurs earlier for smaller-$L$ EOSs. These findings indicate that the timing of crust formation is sensitive to the EOS and highlight the importance of late-time neutrino observations as probes of the matter properties at subnuclear densities.",

      "abstract": "Attributing the supernova remnant RCW 89 to the jittering jets explosion mechanism Noam Soker (Technion, Israel) Accepted for publication in Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) I examine recent radio observations of the supernova remnant (SNR) RCW 89 and identify a point-symmetric morphology composed of two main symmetry axes. I attribute this morphology to a jet-driven explosion in the framework of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). To reach this conclusion, I argue that the MSH 15-52 nebula associated with the pulsar PSR B1509-58, the X-ray hand-like-shaped nebula, and RCW 89 are two separate core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnants that interact with each other. Namely, the nebula SNR G320.4-1.2 contains two CCSN remnants. In essence, I utilize the recent successes of the JJEM to account for the morphologies of point-symmetric CCSN remnants, thereby explaining the morphology of RCW 89 and identifying it as a separate CCSN remnant. I suggest a process by which somewhat more energetic pairs of jets in the JJEM have a positive feedback on the accreted gas onto the newly born neutron star, thereby prolonging the life of the jets and explaining the occurrence of two or three energetic pairs of jets in some CCSNe. This study adds RCW 89 to the growing list of point-symmetric CCSN remnants. The JJEM naturally explains these morphologies as shaped by misaligned pairs of jets that exploded these CCSNe.",

The observations reveal two opposite protrusions, termed ears, projected on the main shell of Tycho. The pair of ear structures resembles that of the SNRs Ia Kepler, SNR G299-2.9, and SNR G1.9+0.3, which earlier studies considered as SNIPs. The requirement that the explosion occurs within hundreds of thousands of years after the formation of the planetary nebula (by the second star to evolve) makes the core-degenerate scenario the most likely for Tycho. Several other possible scenarios lead to an SNIP, but they are unlikely for Tycho. The identification of Tycho as an SNIP leads to two general conclusions. (1) The fraction of SNIPs among normal SNe Ia is very large, ~70-90%. Namely, the vast majority of normal SNe Ia are SNIPs. (2) To accommodate the large fraction of SNIPs, the delay time distribution of normal SNe Ia includes not only the stellar evolution timescale (as usually assumed), but also includes pockets of younger stellar populations in galaxies without ongoing star formation; the SNIPs come from the younger stellar populations in galaxies.",

In this work, we investigate two FXRTs, the LEIA X-ray Transient LXT 240402A and the Einstein Probe EP250207b, whose precise positions lie close to nearby ($z\\!\\lesssim\\!0.1$) quiescent galaxies with negligible probability of chance coincidence, identifying them as particularly promising cases of merger-driven explosions in the local Universe. We used Chandra to derive accurate localizations for both events and secure otherwise ambiguous associations with their optical counterparts. Deep optical and near-infrared observations with VLT, GTC, and LBT were performed to characterize the surrounding environment and search for kilonova emission, the hallmark of neutron star mergers. Complementary early-time X-ray monitoring with Swift and Einstein Probe was used to constrain the non-thermal afterglow. We find that both FXRTs remain compatible with a compact binary merger progenitor, which produced low-mass ejecta and kilonova emission subdominant to the afterglow. However, alternative explanations such as a distant ($z\\!\\gtrsim\\!1$) core-collapse supernova cannot be conclusively ruled out.",

We use two-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations to study the effect of a central energy source, varying the amount, rate, and isotropy of the energy deposition. We post-process the results with a time-dependent Monte Carlo radiation transport code to extract observational signatures. The engine excavates a bubble at the centre of the ejecta, which becomes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable. Sufficiently powerful engines are able to break through the edge of the bubble and accelerate, shred, and compositionally mix the entire ejecta. The breakout of the engine-driven wind occurs at distinct rupture points, and the outflowing high-velocity gas may eventually give rise to radio emission. The dynamical impact of the engine leads to faster rising optical light curves, with photon escape facilitated by the faster expansion of the ejecta and the opening of low-density channels. For models with strong engines, the spectra are initially hot and featureless, but later evolve to resemble those of broad-line Ic supernovae. Under certain conditions, line emission from ionized, low-velocity material near the centre of the ejecta may be able to escape and produce narrow emission similar to that seen in interacting supernovae. We discuss how variability in the engine energy reservoir and injection rate could give rise to a heterogeneous set of events spanning multiple observational classes, including the fast blue optical transients, broad-line Ic supernovae, and superluminous supernovae.",

In this context, we present a major update to the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code COLT to facilitate self-consistent modelling of nebular line and continuum emission from simulated galaxies. We introduce a new thermal equilibrium solver that iteratively couples to the existing ionization solver and radiation field to compute effective gas temperatures by accurately balancing photoionization heating, radiative and dielectronic recombination, collisional ionization, charge exchange, metal and primordial line cooling, free-free emission, and Compton scattering. To prevent over-cooling where non-equilibrium hydrodynamics dominate, we introduce a Courant-limited cooling prescription tied to each cell's sound-crossing time, preserving temperatures in the diffuse halo while allowing physically motivated cooling in the interstellar medium (ISM). Applied to an isolated local galaxy simulation, the equilibrium solver reshapes the ISM phase space by reducing spuriously excessive lukewarm ($T=10^3-10^4$K) gas and better resolving warm ionized and cold neutral phases, while leaving the CGM largely intact. We further implement a level population solver based on modern atomic data, enabling accurate cooling and emissivities for a large library of UV to infrared metal lines, together with newly implemented primordial nebular continuum emission from free-free, free-bound, and two-photon processes. Finally, by applying COLT to the high-redshift THESAN-ZOOM simulations, we reproduce observed emission-line ratios, establishing COLT as a robust framework for forward modelling nebular emission across cosmic time.",

Hosting $2\\times 5500^3\\approx$ 0.33 trillion particles in a box of $370\\, {\\rm Mpc}$ per side, ASTRID is one of the largest cosmological hydrodynamic simulations evolved to $z=0$. ASTRID features a large population of massive black holes (MBHs), covering a wide mass range $4\\times10^{4}\\sim 2\\times 10^{11}\\ M_{\\odot}$. The adopted dynamical friction model provides a relatively accurate description of MBH dynamics, making ASTRID a powerful tool to study MBH growth and mergers in a cosmological context. ASTRID successfully captures the co-evolution of MBHs and their host galaxies, producing $M_{\\rm BH}-M_{\\star}$ and $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ relations in good agreement with observations. Notably, ASTRID generates scatter in these relations that is more consistent with observations than previous simulations, indicating a more realistic MBH diversity. The galaxy stellar mass function at $z=0$ is generally consistent with observational constraints. When dust attenuation is applied, the galaxy luminosity function also agrees well with observations, and the bimodality in galaxy colors is reproduced as well. ASTRID hosts a large population of massive galaxy groups and clusters: 7 halos have $M_{\\rm 200c}>10^{15}\\ M_{\\odot}$, and 9709 halos have $M_{\\rm 200c}>10^{13}\\ M_{\\odot}$. We quantify the stellar mass content in these halos, and find that the correlations between the stellar and halo mass match well with observational constraints. Finally, we present the $z=0$ power spectra of MBH and galaxies, as well as their bias with respect to the matter power spectrum. We find that MBHs with $M_{\\rm BH}\\geq 10^{8}\\ M_{\\odot}$ and galaxies with $M_{\\star}\\geq 10^{10.5}\\ M_{\\odot}$ serve as good tracers of large-scale structure.",

The origin of such absorbers is currently largely unknown because of the low number of galaxy counterparts detected, suggesting that they might be surrounded by low-mass faint sources that fall below the detection threshold of current instruments. We use the THESAN-ZOOM radiation hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the connection between properties of neutral oxygen (OI) absorbers and galaxies within the redshift range $z = 5 - 8$. We find that the circumgalactic medium of galaxies becomes progressively ionised with cosmic time, leading to a decrease of $\\approx 0.2$ in the covering fraction of neutral oxygen, while the total oxygen covering fraction remains constant. The observable absorbers ($N_{\\rm OI} \\gtrsim 10^{13}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$) are not confined to haloes: at $z \\geq 5$ the majority ($\\gtrsim 60\\%$) arise beyond $R_{\\rm{vir}}$, and including these systems is essential to reproduce the observed increase in absorber incidence with redshift.

Identifying its associated debris and that of chemically similar clusters can provide important constraints on the nature of this progenitor system. We aim to identify field stars that are chemically and kinematically linked to $\\omega$ Cen and to a group of globular clusters associated with the Nephele accretion event. We analyse APOGEE DR17 data using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) in a 8-dimensional chemical space to identify field stars whose abundances match those of $\\omega$ Cen. We then compute the orbital energy and angular momentum of these stars and apply a second GMM, calibrated on simulations from the e-TidalGCs project, to determine kinematic compatibility with the predicted streams of $\\omega$ Cen and the associated Nephele GCs. We identify 470 stars chemically compatible with $\\omega$ Cen, of which 58 are also Al-rich, consistent with second-generation stars found in GCs. Of these, 6 stars show kinematics consistent with the predicted $\\omega$ Cen stream, and additional stars are linked to the tidal streams of NGC 6205, NGC 6254, NGC 6273, NGC 6656, and NGC 6809. We also find overlap in chemical and kinematic properties between Nephele stars and the Gaia Sausage-Enceladus population. Our findings indicate stellar debris linked to $\\omega$ Cen and its candidate globular cluster family, consistent with a shared, now-disrupted galactic progenitor.

Physical parameters of whole PNe, extinction coefficent c(Hbeta), electron temperature (Te), and density (Ne) show Gaussian-like distributions with medians of 1.5, 9,900 K, and 1,200 cm(-3), respectively. The abundances of He, N, O, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar in PNe show Gaussian distributions with slight variations across Galactic components. PNe located in thin disk exhibit higher abundances, except for O and Ne, while PNe in halo have the lowest values for all elements. Strong correlations between elements, particularly Sulphur vs. Nitrogen (r=0.87), were identified using statistical tests. Comparisons with previous studies reveal variations ( 2 dex.) in abundance ratios, particularly in halo PNe.

The VLA radio images underlying this article are available at this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) AGN feedback is a well known mechanism in the evolution of galaxies. One open question is the driving mechanism of galaxy-scale outflows. At low redshift, radio jets often interact with the ISM, generating turbulence and driving ionized outflows. Despite this evidence at low redshift, relatively few studies have investigated the radio-ionized gas connection at cosmic noon. Thus, our main goal is to conduct a pilot study using VLA data for three quasars with moderate/high radio power, which have ionized outflows identified in observations from the SUPER survey. We used [OIII] data from SINFONI analyzed in earlier studies, along with new 6.2 GHz VLA radio observations, at comparable spatial resolution. We also incorporate radio data from the literature to explore the radio emission. We detected extended radio structure in our VLA A-array data for two quasars. The extended structure in J1333+1649 aligns with the smaller-scale emission seen in archival images, suggesting a jet propagating from nuclear to galaxy-wide scales. In all three quasars, we found that the brightest radio emission and ionized gas have comparable spatial scales. Furthermore, the position angles of the radio emission and ionized gas present small offsets for the two targets with extended structures. Given that the kinematics of the ionized gas in all three quasars is dominated by outflows, our results suggest a strong connection between radio emission and ionized outflows in typical AGN at cosmic noon. Based on energetic considerations and comparisons with archival data, radio jets could be a significant mechanism for driving outflows in AGN from cosmic noon to low redshifts. However, with the exception of one object (J1333+1649), we cannot rule out the possibility that the radio emission arises from shocks in the interstellar medium caused by disk winds or radiatively driven outflows.",

However, considering intrinsic variability (red noises) of BLAGN, it is still an open question on physical origin of detected optical QPOs from AGN variability or truly from sub-pc BBHs. Here, a simple method is proposed to support optical QPOs related to sub-pc BBHs by detecting QPOs in time dependent optical color evolutions of BLAGN. Periodic variations of obscurations are expected on optical light curves related to sub-pc BBHs, but there should be non-periodic variable obscurations on optical light curves in normal BLAGN. Through simulated optical light curves for intrinsic AGN variability by Continuous AutoRegressive process with time durations around 2800days (similar as time durations of light curves in ZTF), the probability is definitely smaller than $3.3\\times10^{-7}$ that QPOs can be detected in the corresponding optical color evolutions, but about $3.1\\times10^{-2}$ that optical QPOs with periodicity smaller than 1400days (at least two cycles) can be detected in the simulated single-band light curves. Therefore, confidence level is definitely higher than 5$\\sigma$ to support the QPOs in color evolutions not related to intrinsic AGN variability but truly related to sub-pc BBHs. In the near future, the proposed method can be applied for searching reliable optical QPOs in BLAGN through multi-band light curves from the ZTF and the upcoming LSST.",

While most existing studies are biased toward luminous quasars, we conduct carbon monoxide (CO) observations of 17 gravitationally lensed quasars that have four images using the IRAM 30m telescope to investigate the molecular gas content of moderate- to low-luminosity quasars. CO emissions are detected in five out of 17 quasars, corresponding to a detection rate of about 30\\%. Analysis of their star formation activity reveals that these quasars live in gas-rich environments but exhibit weaker starbursts and lower star formation efficiencies compared to other luminous high-redshift quasars. In addition, the CO spectral line energy distributions of the two quasars (SDSS J0924+0219, SDSS J1330+1810) are also consistent with mild star formation instead of extreme starbursts. These results suggest that these lensed quasars reside in weaker starburst environments.",

Extinction maps derived from optical surveys often fail to capture regions with high column density due to the limited photometric depth in optical wavelengths. To address these limitations, we developed the XPNICER method based on near-infrared (NIR) photometric survey data. This method combines the previously established PNICER and Xpercentile techniques, enabling effective mitigation of foreground contamination and improved handling of complex dust structures in the Galactic plane, which thus can provide more accurate extinction estimates, particularly in highly obscured regions. By applying XPNICER to the Galactic Plane Survey from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey, we have generated a series of two-dimensional (2D) dust extinction maps that span roughly 1800 deg2 of the Galactic plane (0< l < 110deg and 140< l < 232deg, |b| < 5deg). These maps, with spatial resolutions between 30arcsec and 300arcsec, can trace extinction up to Av ~ 30-40 mag. This new approach offers higher spatial resolution and better detection of high-extinction regions compared to previous large-scale dust-based maps of the Galactic plane, providing an independent and complementary measure of dust column densities.",

A crucial step forward is that of estimating the fraction of missing baryons in the halos, but it relies on understanding the real cause of the observed CMB temperature asymmetry since many effects might give a non-negligible contribution. Here, we analyzed the contribution played by the anomalous microwave emission (AME) from halo dust grains in the halo of the M 31 galaxy. Assuming either amorphous carbon and silicates dust grains with size ranging from $0.01~\\mu$m to about $0.3~\\mu$m and mass in the range $10^{-14} - 10^{-13}$ g, we estimated the total mass, distribution, and diffuse emission in the $100\\,\\mu$m band of the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS). Then, we estimated the temperature asymmetry induced by the rotation of the M 31 halo and compared the obtained values with the \\textit{Planck}'s SMICA-processed data.

Beckmann, Yohan Dubois, Clotilde Laigle, Natalie A. Webb 25 pages, 16 figures, submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We use the Horizon-AGN cosmological simulation to study the properties of supermassive black hole binaries (MBHBs) contributing most to the gravitational wave background (GWB) signal expected in the pulsar timing array (PTA) band. We develop a pipeline to generate realistic populations of MBHBs, allowing us to estimate both the characteristic strain and GWB time series observable by PTA experiments. We identify potential continuous wave (CW) candidates standing above the background noise, using toy PTA sensitivities representing the current EPTA and future SKA. We estimate the probability of detecting at least one CW with signal-to-noise ratio $>3$ to be $4\\%$ ($20\\%$) for EPTA (SKA)-like sensitivities, assuming a 10-year baseline. We find the GWB to be dominated by hundreds to thousands of binaries at redshifts in the range $0.05-1$, with chirp masses of $10^{8.5}-10^{9.5}\\, M_\\odot$, hosted mainly in quiescent massive galaxies residing in halos of mass $\\sim 10^{13}\\, M_\\odot$. CW candidates have larger masses, lower redshifts and are found in even more massive halos, typical of galaxy groups and clusters. The majority of these systems would appear as AGN rather than quasars, because of their low Eddington ratios. Nevertheless, CW candidates with $f_{\\rm Edd}>10^{-3}$ can still outshine their hosts, particularly in radio and X-ray bands, suggesting them as the most promising route for identification. Our findings imply that optical and near-infrared searches based on light curve variability are challenging and biased toward more luminous systems. Finally, we highlight important caveats in the common method used to compare PTA observations with theoretical models. We find that GWB spectral inferences used by PTAs could be biased toward shallower slopes and higher amplitudes at $f=1/\\rm yr$, thereby reducing the apparent tension between astrophysical expectations and PTA observations.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Large-scale outflows driven by AGNs are an important element of galaxy evolution. Detailed analysis of their properties allows us to probe the activity history of the galactic nucleus and, potentially, other properties of the host galaxy. A recent paper presents detailed radial velocity profiles of outflows in ten AGN host galaxies and shows a common trend of approximately constant velocity in the centre followed by rapid acceleration outside $R_{\\rm tr} \\sim 1 - 3$ kpc. We show that this is a consequence of the AGN-driven outflows clearing the gaseous bulges of the host galaxies and beginning to expand into a region of negligible gas density. We used a 1D semi-analytical code to calculate outflow propagation in each of the ten galaxies, assuming a constant AGN luminosity and an isothermal bulge density profile, with a finite bulge radius, and leaving the gas fraction and total mass of the bulge as free parameters. We also considered the effect of different gas density profiles, variations in bulge velocity dispersion, AGN luminosity, and the effect of outflow fragmentation. Our simplest model can fit six outflow profiles essentially perfectly, while another can be fit if the bulge gas density profile is shallower than isothermal. A shallower density profile also improves the fit in the central regions of the remaining three outflows, but they accelerate faster than our models predict; this could be evidence of significant gas cooling and star formation that reduce the total mass of outflowing gas. We conclude that a simple AGN-driven wind feedback model can explain the detailed velocity profiles of real outflows in local AGN hosts. The free parameters of our model have values that fall well within reasonable ranges. This suggests that the simple scenario we envisioned is close to the true conditions governing the general trends of large-scale outflow expansion.",

Comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Galaxy mergers and interactions are often invoked to explain enhanced star formation, black hole growth, and mass build-up of galaxies at later cosmic times, but their effect is poorly understood at high redshift ($z>2$). We use JADES data to analyse a mass-complete sample of 2095 galaxies at $z=3-9$ with ${\\rm log}(M_\\star/{\\rm M_\\odot}) = [8, 10]$, identifying major merger pairs (projected separation of $5-100$ pkpc, mass ratio $\\geq 1/4$) using a probabilistic method. To look for signatures of enhancement in multiple physical properties, we carefully build a control sample of non-pairs that are simultaneously matched in redshift, stellar mass, isolation, and environment to the pair sample. We find a moderate enhancement in specific star formation rate (sSFR) of $1.12 \\pm 0.05$ at separations $\\lesssim 20$ kpc, which is weakly detectable out to $\\sim50$ kpc. We find that at longer averaging timescales (50-100 Myr) the sSFR is more affected by interactions and environment, whereas at shorter timescales (5-10 Myr) it is dominated by internal feedback and burstiness. By averaging star formation histories, we find two distinct populations: pre-first passage/coalescence (monotonically rising SFR) and post-pericentre pairs (earlier peak in SFR). Finally, we find no significant excess of AGN in pairs, suggesting galaxy interactions are not effectively triggering black hole activity at separations $>5$ kpc. Similarly, we also do not detect an excess in the fraction of Lyman-$\\alpha$ emitters in pairs, implying that at the probed separations, galaxy interactions are not efficient at enhancing Lyman-$\\alpha$ photon production and escape, which may only become important at the smallest scales.",

Disentangling the spectral contributions of young and old stellar populations, we find a large spread of ages and metallicities of the old stars in the nuclear rings. This indicates a persistent infall of metal-poor gas and ongoing episodic star formation over many gigayears. The young stars have metallicities a factor two to three higher than solar in all galaxies except NGC 3351, where the range is from half to twice solar. Previously reported detections of extremely metal poor regions at young stellar age on the rings of these four galaxies are a methodological artifact of the average over all stars, young and old. In addition, it is important to include contributions of very young stars ($<6$ Myr) in this environment. For each of the four galaxies, the extinction maps generated through our population synthesis analysis provide support for the infall scenario. They reveal dust lanes along the leading edges of the stellar bars, indicating the flow of interstellar material towards the circumnuclear zone. Prominent stellar clusters show little extinction, most likely because of the onset of stellar winds. Inside and on the nuclear rings, regions that are largely free of extinction are detected.",

Grundy, Björn Adebahr, Ralf-Jürgen Dettmar Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Dwarf galaxies, due to their shallow gravitational potentials, provide critical environments for studying feedback mechanisms from star formation and its impacts on dwarf galaxy evolution. In particular, radio continuum (RC) observations offer valuable insights into cosmic ray dynamics, which play a significant role in shaping these processes. This study investigates the detectability and spectral characteristics of RC emission in a sample of 15 dwarf galaxies (11 gas-rich, star forming dwarfs and 4 blue compact dwarfs) spanning a broad range of stellar masses and star formation histories. Using multi-band RC data (L/S-, C-, and X-band) from the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we analyse the physical conditions responsible for RC emission and explore the dominant emission mechanisms within these systems. RC emission is detected in 11 out of the 15 galaxies. Our results indicate that RC emission correlates strongly with star formation rate, far-infrared, and stellar mass, while dynamic parameters such as HI and rotational velocity exhibit no significant correlation with RC detectability. Spectral analysis reveals that the RC spectral energy distribution in these galaxies frequently deviate from a simple power-law behavior, instead displaying curvature that suggests more complex underlying physical processes. Statistical model comparison confirms that a single power-law model is inadequate to capture the observed spectral shapes, emphasising the necessity of more sophisticated approaches. Additionally, the observed radio-far-infrared correlation indicates that cosmic ray electrons in lower-mass dwarf galaxies cool more rapidly than they can escape (e.g. via galactic winds), resulting in a measurable RC deficit.",

Gas masses are estimated via scaling relations, yielding baryonic masses and dark-matter (DM) fractions $f_{\\rm DM}(r<r_{\\rm e})$ within the H$\\alpha$ half-light radius. We find high median fractions of $\\langle f_{\\rm gas}\\rangle=0.77$ and $\\langle f_{\\rm DM}\\rangle=0.73$, where $f_{\\rm gas}$ is measured with respect to the baryonic mass and $f_{\\rm DM}$ with respect to the DM+baryonic mass. About two-thirds of systems are DM-dominated within $r_{\\rm e}\\sim0.5-1$ kpc. Both $f_{\\rm gas}$ and $f_{\\rm DM}$ decrease with stellar mass, consistent with simulations. The stellar Tully-Fisher relation shows a tentative offset to higher $v_{\\rm circ}$ at fixed $M_{\\star}$ and substantial intrinsic scatter, suggesting that the relation is only beginning to emerge at $z\\sim5$. We measure a negative correlation between $f_{\\rm DM}$ and baryonic surface density $\\Sigma_{\\rm bar}$, weaker but broadly consistent with trends at cosmic noon and at $z\\sim0$. Qualitatively comparing with modified NFW profiles coupled to an empirical stellar-to-halo mass relation suggests that the lowest $f_{\\rm DM}$ ($\\lesssim0.4$) require cored inner DM profiles, while the highest fractions favour cuspier profiles, potentially reflecting adiabatic contraction. Overall, the elevated $f_{\\rm gas}$ and $f_{\\rm DM}$ at $z\\gtrsim4$ are compatible with progenitors of baryon-dominated systems at $z\\sim2$ and naturally anticipate overmassive black holes at fixed $M_{\\star}$.",

The Nearby Evolved Stars Survey (NESS) is a large multi-telescope project targeting a volume-limited sample of $\\sim$850 stars within 3 kpc in order to derive the dust and gas return rates in the Solar Neighbourhood, and to constrain the physics underlying these processes. We present an initial analysis of the CO-line observations, including detection statistics, carbon isotopic ratios, initial mass-loss rates, and gas-to-dust ratios. We describe a new data reduction pipeline to analyse the available NESS CO data from the JCMT, measuring line parameters and calculating empirical gas mass-loss rates. We present the first release of the available data on 485 sources, one of the largest homogeneous samples of CO data to date. Comparison with a large literature sample finds that high mass-loss rate and especially carbon-rich sources are over-represented in literature, while NESS is probing significantly more sources at low mass-loss rates, detecting 59 sources in CO for the first time and providing useful upper limits. CO line detection rates are 81% for the CO (2--1) line and 75% for CO (3--2). The majority (82%) of detected lines conform to the expected soft parabola shape, while eleven sources show a double wind. Calculated mass-loss rates show power-law relations with both the dust-production rates and expansion velocities up to $\\sim 5 \\times 10^{-6}$~\\msunyr. Median gas-to-dust ratios of 250 and 680 are found for oxygen-rich and carbon-rich sources, respectively. Our analysis of CO observations in this first data release highlights the importance of our volume-limited approach in characterizing the local AGB population as a whole.",

      "abstract": "The Launching of Galactic Winds from a Multiphase ISM Fernando Hidalgo-Pineda, Max Gronke, Philipp Grete 18 pages, 14 figures + appendix. Submitted for review to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Galactic outflows are a key agent of galaxy evolution, yet their observed multiphase nature remains difficult to reconcile with theoretical models, which often fail to explain how cold gas survives interactions with hot, fast winds. We present high-resolution 3D hydrodynamic simulations of hot outflows interacting with a multiphase interstellar medium (ISM), parameterised by its cold-gas volume filling fraction $f_v$, depth $L_{\\rm ISM}$, and clump size $r_{\\rm cl}$. We identify a universal survival criterion $f_v L_{\\rm ISM} \\gtrsim r_{\\rm crit}$ that generalises the classical single-cloud condition ($r_{\\rm cl} > r_{\\rm crit}$) and correctly predicts cold-gas survival across diverse ISM configurations - including scale-free - down to $r_{\\rm cl}/r_{\\rm crit} \\sim 10^{-2}$. The surviving cold phase rapidly loses memory of the initial ISM structure and evolves toward a self-similar clump mass spectrum following Zipf's law ($\\mathrm{d}N/\\mathrm{d}m \\propto m^{-2}$), implying that turbulent mixing and radiative condensation universally shape multiphase outflows. Cold gas assembles into plumes or confined shells of size $\\sim \\chi r_{\\mathrm{cl,min}}$, growing as mass is accreted from the hot phase. The interaction of a laminar wind with a clumpy ISM drives turbulence in both phases, with first-order velocity structure functions following a Kolmogorov scaling and an injection scale set by $L_{\\rm ISM}$, while velocity dispersions reach $\\sigma \\sim c_{\\rm s,cold}$. The areal covering fraction of cold gas approaches unity even for $f_v \\sim 10^{-3}$, though its volume filling fraction stays low, explaining the \"misty\" appearance of observed outflows. Together, these results link small-scale cloud-wind interactions to galaxy-scale feedback, and we discuss their implications for interpreting observations and for modelling multiphase galactic winds in larger-scale simulations.",

These detections double the number of known GC streams, and increase the fraction of GCs with tidal streams at high Galactic latitudes (|b| > 30 degree) to 75%. In contrast to visual expectations, many new streams are wide or short, or misaligned with their progenitors' orbits. Taking advantage of the unbiased density measurements enabled by our method, we also estimate the mass loss rate for the progenitor GCs. We find that several low-mass, large-size clusters have enhanced mass loss rates, indicating that they are approaching complete tidal disruption.",

Price-Whelan, Colin Holm-Hansen 18 pages, 8 figures, submitted to AAS journals. Our code is publicly available on GitHub via this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Gaia mission has led to the discovery of over 100 stellar streams in the Milky Way, most of which likely originated from globular clusters (GCs). As the upcoming wide-field surveys can potentially continue to increase the number of known streams, there is a growing need to shift focus from manual detection of individual streams to automated detection methods that prioritize both quality and quantity. Traditional techniques rely heavily on the visual expectation that GC streams are dynamically cold and thin. This assumption does not hold for all streams, whose morphologies and kinematics can vary significantly with the progenitor's mass and orbit. As a result, these methods are biased toward a subset of the whole stream population, with often unquantified purity and completeness. In this work, we present StarStream, an automatic stream detection algorithm based on a physics-inspired model rather than visual expectation. Our method provides a more accurate prediction of stream stars in the multi-dimensional space of observables, while using fewer free parameters to account for the diversity of streams. Applied to a mock GC stream catalog tailored for the Gaia DR3 dataset, our algorithm achieves both purity and completeness of at least 65% at Galactic latitudes |b| > 30 degree.",

NASA has established several science requirements for the GBTDS to ensure RGES success. A key advantage of RGES is Roman's high angular resolution, which will allow detection of flux from many host stars. One requirement specifies that Roman must measure the masses and distances of 40% of detected planet hosts with 20% precision or better. To test this, we simulated microlensing events toward the GBTDS fields and used Fisher matrix analysis to estimate light curve parameter uncertainties. Combining these with Roman imaging observables (lens flux, relative lens-source proper motion), we estimated the achievable precision of lens mass and distance measurements. Using pyLIMASS, a publicly available code for estimating lens properties, we applied this analysis to 3,000 simulated events. Assuming the Cassan et al. (2012) exoplanet mass function, we find that >40% of host stars meet the required 20% precision threshold, confirming that the GBTDS can satisfy the mission requirement. We validated our approach by comparing our inferred lens masses and distances to empirical measurements from detailed image-constrained light curve modeling of historical microlensing events with Hubble and Keck follow-up imaging. Our results agree within roughly 1 sigma, demonstrating that both approaches yield consistent and reliable mass and distance estimates, and confirming the robustness of our simulations for Roman-era microlensing science.",

Williams 28 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We identify stellar structures in the PHANGS sample of 74 nearby galaxies and construct morphological masks of sub-galactic environments based on Spitzer 3.6 micron images. At the simplest level, we distinguish centres, bars, spiral arms, interarm and discs without strong spirals. Slightly more sophisticated masks include rings and lenses, publicly released but not explicitly used in this paper. We examine trends using PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1) intensity maps and tracers of star formation. The interarm regions and discs without strong spirals dominate in area, whereas molecular gas and star formation are quite evenly distributed among the five basic environments. We reproduce the molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt relation with a slope compatible with unity within the uncertainties, without significant slope differences among environments. In contrast to early studies, we find that bars are not always deserts devoid of gas and star formation, but instead they show large diversity. Similarly, spiral arms do not account for most of the gas and star formation in disc galaxies, and they do not have shorter depletion times than the interarm regions. Spiral arms accumulate gas and star formation, without systematically boosting the star formation efficiency. Centres harbour remarkably high surface densities and on average shorter depletion times than other environments. Centres of barred galaxies show higher surface densities and wider distributions compared to the outer disc; yet, depletion times are similar to unbarred galaxies, suggesting highly intermittent periods of star formation when bars episodically drive gas inflow, without enhancing the central star formation efficiency permanently. In conclusion, we provide quantitative evidence that stellar structures in galaxies strongly affect the organisation of molecular gas and star formation, but their impact on star formation efficiency is more subtle.",

Davis, Freeke van de Voort, Ilaria Ruffa Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 541, Issue 1, July 2025, Pages 494-515 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The dominant processes by which galaxies replenish their cold gas reservoirs remain disputed, especially in massive galaxies. Stellar-gas kinematic misalignments offer an opportunity to study these replenishment processes. However, observed distributions of these misalignments conflict with current models of gas replenishment in early-type galaxies (ETGs), with longer relaxation timescales suggested as a possible solution. We use the EAGLE simulation to explore the relaxation of unstable misaligned gas in galaxies with masses of $M_{*}\\geqslant \\mathrm{10^{9.5}}$ M$_\\odot$ between $0<z<1$. We extract misalignments from formation to relaxation providing a sample of $\\sim3200$ relaxations. We find relaxation timescales tend to be short-duration, with median lifetimes of $\\sim0.5$ Gyr, though with a notable population of unstable misalignments lasting $\\gtrsim1$ Gyr. Relaxation time distributions show a log-linear relationship, with $\\approx20$ per cent of unstable misalignments persisting for $\\gtrsim3$ torquing times. Long-lived unstable misalignments are predominantly found in galaxies with higher stellar masses, lower star-forming gas fractions, higher ongoing gas inflow, and which reside in the centres of dense environments. Mergers only cause $\\approx10$ per cent of unstable misalignments among galaxies at $z<0.35$, and $\\approx21$ per cent at $0.35<z<1.0$ in EAGLE. We conclude that, at least in EAGLE, unstable kinematic misalignments are not predominantly driven by gas-rich minor mergers at any redshift probed. Additionally, processes that significantly extend relaxation times are not dominant in the galaxy population. Instead, we see a diverse formation pathway for misalignments such as through hot halo cooling.",

Missing factor 2 Astronomy & Astrophysics, Volume 694, id.A155, 11 pp. 2025 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Recent studies have examined the role of tides in the star formation process. They suggest, notably, that the tides determine the characteristic mass of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) by preventing the collapse of density fluctuations that would become gravitationally unstable in the absence of the tidal field generated by a neighboring central mass. However, most of these studies consider the tidal collapse condition as a 1D process or use a scalar virial condition and thus neglect the anisotropy of the tidal field and its compressive effects. In the present paper, we consider a turbulence-induced density perturbation formed in the envelope of a central core. This perturbation is subject to a tidal field generated by the central core. We study its evolution taking dynamical effects and the anisotropy of the tides into account. Based on the general tensorial virial equations, we determine a new collapse condition that takes these mechanisms into account. We identify two regimes: (i) a weak tidal regime in which the dynamics of the perturbation is only slightly modified by the action of the tides and (ii) a strong tidal regime in which the density threshold for collapse can potentially be increased due to the combined effects of the tides and the rotational support generated by the tidal synchronization of the perturbation with the orbital motion. In the case of a turbulence-induced density perturbation formed in the vicinity of a first Larson core, we show that the density threshold above which the perturbation collapses is increased only for low-mass perturbations (less than 2.7 solar mass) and only by at most a factor of 1.5. We conclude that tides likely do not play a major role in the process of star formation or in the determination of the characteristic mass of the IMF. We propose an alternative explanation for the observed value of the characteristic mass of the IMF.",

Simulations predict that cold gas flows into galaxies through cosmic filaments, determining the disk formation and galaxy evolution. The cold gas accretion modes in the CGM and their dependence on dark matter halo mass and redshift remain puzzling. Resolving the kiloparsec-scale kinematics and dynamics of cold gas interacting with the disk, dust, and metals in different environments is particularly lacking at z > 2. Here we report two disturbed cold gas structures traced by ultra-strong MgII absorbers (rest-frame equivalent width Wr > 2 Å) exhibiting high kinematic velocities (> 500 km/s) and their environments at z ~ 4.9 and z ~ 2.6. Observations were conducted with VLT/MUSE, JWST/NIRCam, and ALMA to detect Lya and nebular emission lines, as well as dust continuum emission in the vicinity of these two absorbing gas structures. We identify two Lya emitters associated with a strong MgII absorber pair separated by ~1000 km/s at z~ 4.87. The pair exhibits relative differences in metallicity, dust content, and ionization states, suggesting internal metal and dust exchange within the ultra-large cold gas structure. For the strong MgII absorber at z = 2.5652, we detect a dusty star-forming galaxy at a projected distance of $D = 38$ kpc. This galaxy exhibits prominent HeI, [SIII], and Paschen$\\gamma$ lines, along with significant dust continuum. It has a star formation rate of ~ 121 +/- 33 $M_{\\odot}$/yr and likely harbors a rotating disk. These findings tentatively suggest that cold gas at high redshifts plays a critical role in driving disk formation and actively participates in the transfer of metals and dust within the overdense regions of the CGM.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Using 6 Milky Way analogues with two different numerical resolutions from the Auriga simulation, we investigate the total mass, spatial distribution and kinematics of the Population III star relics in the Milky Way analogues at $z=0$. These relics (primarily second generation stars) formed over a wide redshift range, from about $z=22$ to $z=4$, with an average formation redshift of $z \\sim 10.0$, and comprise about $2\\times10^{-5}$ of the entire galactic stellar population. The disk and bulge components host only a small fraction of these relics, contributing less than $12$ percent in total. The stellar halo, in particular the outer stellar halo of which galactic radius $r>30$ kpc, hosts the largest fraction (about 46 percent on average), with an average of one relic star for per $4,000$ to $10,000$ stars, making it a promising region for observational searches. Additionally, around $18$ percent of the Population III star relics are found in satellite galaxies, with smaller and older satellite galaxies tending to contain a higher proportion of these stars. Thus, low-mass and early-formed satellite galaxies are also ideal targets for finding such relics, although some satellite galaxies may lack them entirely. The spatial distribution and kinematics of these stars show good numerical convergence across different simulation resolutions. Our results provide valuable guidance for searches of the Population III star relics and offer insights for interpreting findings from ongoing and future stellar archaeology surveys.",

Raimundo Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 543, Issue 3, November 2025, Pages 2974-2986 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Stellar-gas kinematic misalignments are a transient phenomenon observed in $\\sim11\\%$ of the local galaxy population. According to current models, misaligned gas is expected to lose angular momentum and relax into the galactic plane on timescales of $\\sim0.1$ Gyr, driving gas toward the central regions of the galaxy. Recent observational studies have found a higher incidence of active galactic nuclei in misaligned galaxies. We use the EAGLE simulation to explore the connection between stellar-gas misalignments and enhanced central black hole (BH) activity between $0<z<1$. We use a sample of $\\sim5600$ galaxies with a stellar mass of $M_{*}\\geqslant \\mathrm{10^{9.5}}$ M$_\\odot$ that feature long-lived stellar-gas alignment, counter-rotation, and unstable misalignments (non-coplanarity). Over time windows of $0.5$ Gyr, we find that galaxies experiencing an unstable misalignment have systematically enhanced BH growth during relaxation. Galaxies with long-term counter-rotation show little difference in BH growth compared to aligned galaxies. We suggest that this enhanced BH growth is driven by loss of angular momentum in unstable misaligned gas discs which is able to drive gas inward toward the vicinity of the BH. At $z\\approx0.1$, we find a greater incidence of overmassive BHs in galaxies that have spent a greater fraction of time with unstable stellar-gas kinematic misalignments over the preceding $\\approx2$ Gyr compared to control samples of aligned galaxies. In agreement with observations, we conclude that BH activity is enhanced in misaligned systems in EAGLE and suggest that the presence of overmassive BHs may be indicative of a past stellar-gas kinematic misalignment.",

Minor corrections identified in paper proofs Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We use the narrow [Ne v] $\\lambda$3427 emission line detected in the recently published JWST spectra of two galaxies, at z = 6.9 and 5.6, to study the key properties of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in their centers. Using a new empirical scaling linking the [Ne v] line emission with AGN accretion-driven (continuum) emission, derived from a highly complete low-redshift AGN sample, we show that the [Ne v] emission in the two z > 5 galaxies implies total (bolometric) AGN luminosities of order L_bol~(4-8)x10^45 erg/s. Assuming that the radiation emitted from these systems is Eddington limited, the (minimal) black hole masses are of order M_BH>10^7 M_sun. Combined with the published stellar masses of the galaxies, estimated from dedicated fitting of their spectral energy distributions, the implied BH-to-stellar mass ratios are of order M_BH/M_host~0.1-1. This is considerably higher than what is found in the local Universe, but is consistent with the general trend seen in some other z > 5 AGN. Given the intrinsic weakness of the [Ne v] line and the nature of the [Ne v]-to-L_bol scaling, any (rare) detection of the [Ne v] $\\lambda$3427 line at z > 5 would translate to similarly high AGN luminosities and SMBH masses, thus providing a unique observational path for studying luminous AGN well into the epoch of reionization, including obscured sources.",

Marsengo-Colazo, Facundo Rodriguez, Manuel Merchán 13 pages, 10 figures, accepted in Astronomy and Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Investigations of intrinsic alignments suggest a link between the alignment of a central galaxy's major axis with the galaxy distribution and its internal galaxy-halo shape alignment. In contrast, blue central galaxies typically exhibit almost no alignment signal, owing to a stronger internal misalignment with their halo. We investigated how the internal alignment between the principal axes of the stellar and dark matter components evolves over time as a function of the total mass of central galaxies at z=0. In particular, we aim to understand why disk-dominated, blue central galaxies often show weak or absent alignment signals with the galaxy distribution in their group and in the larger-scale cosmic structure. We used data from the IllustrisTNG300-1 run and selected a sample of bright central galaxies at z=0. We computed the principal axes of the stellar and dark matter components, along with their angular momenta, to obtain the various alignment angles analyzed in this study. Also, we used the merger trees to determine the number of major mergers between z=20 and z=0, and to track their shapes along their main branch. We examined secondary dependencies of the galaxy-halo alignment on properties such as color and merger history. We analyzed how shape alignments relate to the dynamical coupling between the angular momentum directions of the stellar and dark matter components. The results show that massive centrals tend to align with the shape of their inner halo, and they are typically red and have undergone numerous mergers. Lower-mass red centrals, and those that have experienced many mergers exhibit the strongest evolution toward alignment. Blue centrals, in contrast, are more strongly influenced by the link between the stellar and dark matter angular momenta, such that they evolve toward either alignment or misalignment with both the shape and angular momentum of the inner halo.",

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Understanding the formation and evolutionary history of the Milky Way requires detailed mapping of its stellar components, which preserve fossil records of the Galaxy's assembly through cosmic time. RR Lyrae stars are particularly well-suited for this endeavor, as they are old, standard candle variables that probe the Galaxy's earliest formation epochs. In this work, we employ a hierarchical Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to characterize the three-dimensional density distribution of RR Lyrae stars in the Milky Way. This approach provides a flexible framework for modeling complex stellar distributions, particularly in the inner Galaxy where the bulge, disk, and halo components overlap. Our analysis reveals that the inner Galaxy is dominated by a distinct prolate stellar population with axis ratio $q$=1.31. Consistent with previous work, we find the halo follows a $r^{-4}$ power-law profile that flattens within 12 kpc of the Galactic center. We also confirm the halo is oblate ($q$=0.70) with a tilt angle of $18^{\\circ}$. We report for the first time that this tilt aligns the halo major axis in the direction of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. These results establish GMMs as an effective and flexible tool for modeling Galactic structure and provide new constraints on the distribution of old stars in the inner Galaxy.",

Abstract abridged for the arxiv submission Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present ALMA CO observations of 14 HI-detected galaxies from the CHILES survey found in a cosmic over-density at z~0.12. This is the largest collection of spatially resolved CO + HI observations beyond the local Universe (z>0.05) to date. While the HI-detected parent sample spans a range of stellar masses, star formation rates (SFR), and environments, we only directly detect CO in the highest stellar mass galaxies, log(M_*/M_Sun)>10.0, with SFRs greater than ~2 M_Sun/yr. The detected CO has the kinematic signature of a rotating disk, consistent with the HI. We stack the CO non-detections and find a mean H_2 mass of log(M_H2/M_Sun) = 8.46 in galaxies with a mean stellar mass of log(M_*/M_Sun) = 9.35. In addition to high stellar masses and SFRs, the systems detected in CO are spatially larger, have redder overall colors, and exhibit broader (stacked) line widths. The CO emission is spatially coincident with both the highest stellar mass surface density and star forming region of the galaxies, as revealed by the 1.4 GHz continuum emission. We interpret the redder colors as the molecular gas being coincident with dusty regions of obscured star formation. The 14 HI detections show a range of morphologies, but the HI reservoir is always more extended than the CO. Finally, we compare with samples in the literature and find mild evidence for evolution in the molecular gas reservoir and H_2-to-HI gas ratio with redshift in HI flux-limited samples. We show that the scatter in the HI, and HI-to-stellar mass ratio is too great to conclusively measure evolution below z=0.2, and is even extremely difficult below z=0.4. Detections from CHILES are likely to be the only individual galaxies detected in HI between 0.1<z<0.23 for the foreseeable future due to the severity of satellite radio frequency interference, and its preferential impact on short baselines which dominate contemporary HI surveys.",

Bayliss, M.D. Gladders, Gourav Khullar, Keren Sharon, Keunho Kim, Dan Coe, Lindsey Bleem, Taweewat Somboonpanyakul Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Understanding the properties of the first generation of galaxies is an ongoing challenge in observational astrophysics. While advances in deep field observation have led to the identification of large numbers of galaxies within the Epoch of Reionization, there are very few observed galaxies at this range that are sufficiently bright for high signal-to-noise spectroscopy. To this end, we analyse HST and ground-based photometry of five candidate strongly lensed galaxies, all projected behind the cores of massive clusters and with similarly red optical-NIR colors. All are characterized by a drop-off in their spectra between the near-infrared and optical wavelengths, corresponding to a Lyman-break that sets a lower bound on their redshifts. Using the open-source SED modeling software Prospector, we characterize two of these galaxies as high-z (z $\\sim$ 6.5-7) while the other three are low-z (z $\\sim$ 2) despite all five having similar apparent magnitudes at the observed wavelengths. We demonstrate that for the brightest dropout candidates we can distinguish high-z galaxies from red or dusty low-z galaxies using limited photometric data. The bright sources enable deep constraints on the dropout color which, in combination with flat continua measured in redder bands, require high-z solutions when searching the parameter space. At the time of writing this work significantly increases the number of m_AB < 24 galaxies at or above a redshift of 6, and provides a path forward for future analysis on the early era of galaxy formation",

The classical swing-amplification theory can qualitatively describe the spontaneous bar instability of stellar disks. Still, it cannot quantify the bar formation process or explain why some disk galaxies do not have a bar. Recent studies found that the bar formation timescale depends exponentially on the disk mass fraction of the host galaxy (dubbed as \"Fujii relation\"), but they only explored a limited parameter space, where the physical effects of Toomre $Q$ (local disk stability parameter) and disk scale height of the host galaxies are not fully explored. In this work, we check the robustness of the Fujii relation in a higher-dimensional parameter space of disk mass fraction, Toomre $Q$, and scale height. We find that the Fujii relation holds for disk galaxies with physically reasonable Toomre $Q$ and scale height. Furthermore, the bar formation timescale also approximately linearly depends on both Toomre $Q$ and scale height, with a more prolonged bar formation in a hotter or thicker disk. We propose an empirical relation to combine the dependency of the bar formation timescale on the three parameters. Based on the empirical relation and recent observations, we estimate that the bar formation timescale in pure stellar disks ranges from $0.20_{-0.06}^{+0.09}~\\mathrm{Gyr}$ to $12.20_{-2.80}^{+3.37}~\\mathrm{Gyr}$ or even significantly beyond the Hubble timescale in some extreme cases.",

The physical conditions, such as electron temperature ($T_e$) and density ($n_e$), were derived using diagnostic emission lines through the PyNeb software. Elemental abundances of key species, including He, O, N, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar, were determined for both nebulae, offering insights into their nucleosynthesis history and evolutionary status. High-resolution HST and Pan-STARRS imaging further elucidate the morphological structures of the nebulae. NGC~2392 exhibits a well-defined double-shell structure and moderate excitation characteristics, while NGC~4361 displays a diffuse elliptical morphology with high-excitation conditions and a notably low nitrogen content. The observed line spectra and derived abundances point toward distinct progenitor histories for the two PNe, with NGC~2392 originating from a younger, intermediate-mass progenitor, while NGC~4361 traces an older, metal-poor Population II star. This comparative study enhances our understanding of the evolution and chemical enrichment processes of low- to intermediate-mass stars.",

The method builds on an explicit M1 closure scheme with a reduced speed of light approximation (RSLA) for massively parallel computation. Our scheme introduces a complementary non-RSLA radiation component that dominates in optically thick regions. This hybrid treatment restores physical energy conservation inside protostars, which would otherwise be violated under the RSLA, while retaining the advantage of large time steps. To overcome the limitation of the conventional M1 closure in solving radiative transfer in extremely optically thick regions inside protostars and across steep optical-depth gradients near their surfaces, we incorporate the optical-depth information of neighboring cells into the radiative transfer calculation. We further evolve photon number densities in addition to radiation energy densities to reconstruct an effective local spectrum on the fly without resorting to costly multi-frequency transport. We implement this scheme in the adaptive mesh refinement code SFUMATO and verify its validity through a series of test calculations. As an application, we follow the early evolution of a massive protostar formed at high redshift, within a full cosmological context. The results reveal a continuous structure connecting the swollen protostar and its surrounding disk, which cannot be captured in conventional one-dimensional models. This explicit RHD scheme opens a path to studies of protostellar evolution and its interaction with the accretion flow in realistic three-dimensional environments.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) (abridged) Streamers are newly identified channels that transport mass from large, molecular-cloud scales down to small, protoplanetary-disk scales. To better understand their impact on planet formation, it is essential to study their physical and chemical properties. In this framework, we aim to characterize the longest streamer identified in carbon chain emission within the Class I system L1489 IRS, connecting the nearby prestellar core L1489 to the young stellar object (YSO). We observed multiple transitions of C$_2$H, ortho-c-C$_3$H$_2$, and HC$_3$N in L1489 IRS with NOEMA and IRAM-30m at 3mm and 2mm. Using a variety of radiative transfer methods, including a hyperfine structure (HFS) fitting, rotational diagrams, and proposing a new self-consistent Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach combined with the non-LTE RADEX code, we derived the column densities and abundances of those molecules, as well as the H$_2$ number density along the streamer. This enabled us to estimate its mass, infall rate, and its impact on the {star+disk} system's mass. We found lower limits on the streamer mass of $\\geq(4.67-18.3)\\times10^{-3}$ $M_\\odot$ (i.e., $\\geq0.65-2.57$ times the current disk mass) and an infall rate of $\\geq(1.94-7.57)\\times10^{-7}$ $M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, where the ranges correspond to the different molecular tracers. These values are consistent with those derived in similar Class I objects. This suggests that the disk could be fully replenished by streamer material. Given its mass, the streamer is likely at the origin of the external warped disk seen in this system, as predicted by numerical simulations. Moreover, the first investigations based on the C$_2$H/c-C$_3$H$_2$ and HC$_3$N/c-C$_3$H$_2$ abundance ratios suggest that the streamer chemistry may be inherited from the core. These results suggest, for the first time, that the chemical composition of a Class I object is [...]",

David, Daniel Lecoanet, Pascale Garaud Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn) Magnetism is thought to play an important role in the evolution and dynamics of stars, though little is known about magnetic fields deep within stellar interiors. A promising avenue for probing these fields uses asteroseismic observations of global oscillations that result from the coupling of acoustic waves in the convective zone to internal gravity waves (IGWs) in the radiative interior. Recent modeling efforts implicate deep magnetic fields in the suppression of dipole mixed modes observed in 20% of red giants and a number of high-mass main sequence stars. Previous numerical and theoretical work shows that core magnetic fields could suppress axisymmetric global modes by refracting down-going IGWs into slow-magnetosonic (SM) waves that damp at magnetic cutoff heights. Here, we extend these results to the non-axisymmetric case, for which the IGWs and SM waves are coupled to a continuous spectrum of Alfven waves (AWs). We consider a Cartesian model of the radiative interior with uniform stratification and a spatially-varying, current-free magnetic field. Using a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation to solve for the vertical mode structure, corroborated with numerical simulations, we show that IGWs convert to up-going SM waves, which resonate with the Alfven spectrum and produce mixed SM-AW modes. We find cutoff heights (as in the axisymmetric case), above which the SM/SM-AWs convert to AWs. Latitudinal variations of the background magnetic field lead to phase mixing of the AWs, resulting in rapid damping. Our results suggest that energy in both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric IGWs is lost via interactions with a strong magnetic field.",

The explanation most often put forth is that a shutdown or mode change in the stellar dynamo leads to a sharp decrease in angular momentum loss in magnetized coronal winds. In this paper, we explore an alternate possibility, namely a collapse of the wind itself through a reduction of coronal heating. We show that in the low coronal temperature ($T_0$) limit, even at solar-like low rotation rates ($\\Omega$) and coronal magnetic field strength ($B_{r0}$), magnetocentrifugal effects are important and preclude expression of the mass and angular momentum loss rates as power-laws of $T_0$ or $\\Omega$ when $T_0$ drops below $\\simeq 1.5\\,$MK. Mass loss is found to scale linearly with power input into the wind at all coronal temperatures. Introducing an ad hoc power law relationship $T_0\\propto B_{r0}^\\sigma$ while retaining the ``standard'' dynamo relationship $B_{r0}\\propto\\Omega$, we show that reproducing the observed break in gyrochronology requires an exponent $\\sigma\\gtrsim 1.5$, with which is associated a drop by over 3 orders of magnitude in power input into the quiet corona. This appears physically unrealistic, given current observations of chromospheric and coronal non-thermal emission in aged solar-type stars.",

In this work, we investigate the roles of radiation and gas pressures in envelope unbinding.

The parameters include the radiation to gas energy ratio $\\E/\\eg\\in[0.2,3.2]$, speed of the ejecta, ranging from 70\\% to 85\\% of the escape velocity, and EoS. For comparison, we also perform simulations with pure hydrodynamic or no radiation pressure conditions. Our simulations demonstrate that the radiation pressure is crucial for the envelope unbinding. Specifically, the radiation pressure may dominate in a high opacity and high luminosity layer just below the recombination front, where it can accelerate the sub-escape material to escape velocities. A realistic EoS further enhances the pressure gradient, especially during the early phase of ejection at small radii, promoting additional envelope ejection. Both $\\E/\\eg$ and EoS significantly alter light curve shapes, provide observable diagnostics for these processes.

(RAA) Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) This study investigates the gravitational waves (GWs) generated by the emergence of magnetic flux tubes in the solar convection zone. We focus on the upward buoyancy of magnetic flux tubes, which leads to significant magnetic activity and the formation of active region sunspots. This study adopts parameters representative of a moderate-sized solar active region to estimate the GWs generated by the emergence of magnetic flux tubes. Our results indicate that the GW strain amplitude, achievable through signal superposition and detection at close proximity (e.g., approximately one solar radius from the solar surface), may reach $\\sim$10$^{-29}$. The characteristic GW frequency is estimated at $\\sim$10$^{-5}$ Hz, placing it at the high-frequency end of the sensitivity band of Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) methods. However, the estimated strain amplitudes remain orders of magnitude below the sensitivity thresholds of current and foreseeable gravitational wave detectors. Notably, reducing the cadence $\\Delta t$ of Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations to approximately 2 hours ($\\Delta t = 2\\text{hours}$) would raise the maximum detectable frequency to about $5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{Hz}$, thereby encompassing the dominant spectral component of solar activity-related GWs predicted in this study, offering a potential pathway for future detection.

In protostellar envelopes, the water snowline can be estimated as a function of luminosity using a relation derived from radiative transfer models, and these predictions are consistent with observations. However, accurately estimating the water snowline in protoplanetary disks requires new relations that account for the disk structure. We present the relations between luminosity and water snowline using the dust continuum radiative transfer models with various density structures. We adopt two-dimensional density structures for an envelope-only model (Model E), an envelope+disk+cavity model (Model E+D), and a protoplanetary disk model (Model PPD). The relations between the water snowline, where T_dust = 100 K, and the total luminosity, ranging 0.1-1,000 solar luminosity, are well fitted by a power-law relation, R_snow=a * (L/L_solar)^p au. The factor a decreases with increasing disk density, while the power index p has values around 0.5 in all models. As the disk becomes denser, the water snowline forms at smaller radii even at the same luminosity, since dense dust hinders photon propagation. We also explore the effect of viscous heating on the water snowline. In Model PPD with viscous heating, the water snowline shifts outward by a few au up to 15 au, increasing the factor a and decreasing the power index p. In Model E+D with lower disk mass, the effect of viscous heating is negligible, indicating that the disk mass controls the effect. The discrepancy between our models and direct observations provides insights into the recent outburst event and the presence of a disk structure in low-mass YSOs.",

The method applies Fourier analysis to the annual SILSO SSN record, from 1700.5 to 2023.5, to identify in the spectrum, four strong components in the decadal, 10 to 11 year period, range and four weaker components in the octal, 8 to 9 year period, range. The time variation of each component is isolated by a new method of narrow band pass filtering. The components are fitted with sinusoids at the beginning/end of the SSN record for back/forward projection. Back projection successfully replicated the long term features of the Maunder Minimum. Forward projection predicts a Maunder-like grand minimum from 2030 to 2110, encompassing solar cycles 26 to 35. Details of short term features of SSN within the grand minimum are less certain. The octal contribution to SSN is shown to occasionally exceed the decadal contribution both in the projection and also within the observational record. Predicted SSN amplitudes for cycles 26 and 28 are about 50, about half the amplitude of cycles 24 and 25. The amplitude of cycle 27 is difficult to forecast as it may emerge as a double peak of cycle 26 rather than as two separate cycles 26 and 27. Amplitudes forecast for cycles 29 to 33 are, on average, about half the amplitude of cycles 26 and 27 with the lowest cycle of the grand minimum, cycle 30, occurring around 2070. Macro changes in SSN such as the occurrence of grand solar minima and maxima and micro changes such as the Waldmeier Effect are explained in terms of interference between the octal and decadal components evident in the SSN spectrum. The explanation differs from current theories that suggest SSN variability is due to stochastic forcing of a single solar dynamo process.",

Additional atomic data relating to Pb, and in particular photoionization cross sections, are needed to allow a greater understanding of the origin of these observed Pb abundances, and hence discern the evolutionary pathway of these stars. We have calculated level-resolved photoionization cross sections for Pb III, IV, V and VI. Four new target structures have been developed with the General Relativistic Atomic Structure Package (GRASP0), whose corresponding energy levels, Einstein A-coefficients and oscillator strengths have been found to be in good agreement with previous experimental and theoretical sources. The photoionization cross sections calculated using the Dirac Atomic R-matrix Codes (DARC) are available in TOPBASE format, and follow the trends expected for an isonuclear series. These new Pb data sets will now allow for the modelling of Pb abundances and line opacities under Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (non-LTE) conditions. Using the helium-rich hot subdwarf EC 22536-5304 as a test case, we show that there are noticeable differences in the Pb line profiles across the ultraviolet and optical wavelength regions under LTE and non-LTE conditions. There is both depletion and enrichment of individual Pb species. This highlights the importance of applying non-LTE conditions when modelling EC 22536-5304, as well as other O/B-type stars.",

The particle-in-cell (PIC) method, capable of resolving kinetic (particle-scale) physics, is extensively used to study the kinetic effects in magnetic reconnection. Meanwhile, because of the high computational cost, PIC simulations cannot capture the interaction between kinetic and fluid dynamics, which poses a major obstacle to understanding magnetic reconnection in large-scale phenomena such as solar flares. A multi-hierarchy simulation that combines Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and PIC provides a promising means to overcome these spatial and temporal scale gaps. We developed a multi-hierarchy simulation code KAMMUY (Kinetic And Magnetohydrodynamic MUlti-hierarchY simulation code), in which an ideal MHD simulation for a large domain and a PIC simulation for a smaller domain are solved in parallel with mutual information exchange. To validate the code, we conducted test simulations of MHD wave propagation and the shock tube problem. The results demonstrate that short-wavelength, high-frequency waves generated in the PIC region do not propagate into the MHD region, whereas MHD-scale structures propagate smoothly into the PIC region, highlighting the capability of our code for numerical studies of magnetic reconnection. By applying the KAMMUY code to magnetic reconnection while varying the PIC domain size, we find that the reconnection rate remains unchanged, regardless of the extent of the PIC region where the Hall magnetic field is present. It suggests that the spatial extension of the Hall magnetic field on the scale of $10 \\sim 100 \\lambda_i$ does not influence the reconnection rate.",

We uncover the physical mechanism behind this bimodality: a previously unreported ``parallel tracks'' phenomenon observed in the relationship between the donor's evolutionary stage and its fundamental parameters, such as luminosity and radius.

Ho, Robert F. Wimmer-Schweingruber, Christopher J. Owen 14 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Local particle acceleration in the shock sheath region formed during the interaction between multiple coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is a complicated process that is still under investigation. On March 23, 2024, the successive eruption of two magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) from the solar active region 3614 produced twin CMEs, as identified in coronagraph images. By analyzing in-situ data from Solar Orbiter and Wind, it is found that the primary ICME-driven shock overtook the preceding ICME, trapping it in the sheath between the shock and the primary ICME, forming the ICME-in-sheath (IIS) structure. Using Solar Orbiter observations, we show that both electrons and ions are accelerated within the IIS. A clear enhancement of suprathermal electrons was observed at the IIS boundary, where strong flow shear and large magnetic field variation suggest possible local electron acceleration. Electrons (>38 keV) exhibit a long-lasting enhancement in the IIS with a spectral index of ~2.2, similar to that in the shock sheath and the primary ICME, indicating a similar solar origin. Inside both the sheath and IIS, spectra of proton and 4He are generally consistent with the prediction of the diffusive shock acceleration, whereas Fe and O present a double power-law shape. Additionally, the Fe/O ratio in the IIS is higher than that in the sheath, and more close to the abundance of the flare-related particles, suggesting the remnant particles of flare confined in the IIS.",

Currie, Matthew K. Browning Submitted to ApJ. Not yet peer reviewed. Comments welcome Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn) The bulk properties of convection in stellar and giant planet interiors are often assumed to be independent of the molecular diffusivities, which are very small. By contrast, simulations of this process in rotating, spherical shells, which are typically driven by conductive boundary heat fluxes, generally yield results that depend on the diffusivity. This makes it challenging to extrapolate these simulation results to real objects. However, laboratory models and Cartesian-box simulations suggest diffusion-free dynamics can be obtained if convection is driven using prescribed internal heating and cooling instead of boundary fluxes. Here, we apply this methodology to simulations of Boussinesq, hydrodynamic rotating spherical shell convection. We find that this set-up unambiguously yields diffusion-free behaviour for bulk 'thermal' properties of the convection, such as the radial temperature contrast and the convective heat transport. Moreover, the transition from prograde to retrograde equatorial zonal flow is diffusion-free and only depends on the convective Rossby number. The diffusivity dependence of other bulk 'kinematic' properties is regime-dependent. In simulations that are rotationally constrained, the convective velocities, and the strength and structure of the zonal flow, are diffusion-dependent, although the zonal flow appears to approach a diffusion-free state for sufficiently high supercriticality. In simulations that are uninfluenced by rotation, or are only influenced by rotation at large scales, diffusion-free convective velocities and zonal flow amplitudes are obtained. The result that many aspects of our idealised simulations are diffusion-free has promising implications for the development of realistic stellar and giant planet convection models that can access diffusion-free regimes.",

Woudt This article has been accepted for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We present a comprehensive photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric study of the intermediate polar (IP) 1RXS J080114.6-462324, using observations from the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) 1.0-m and 1.9-m telescopes and the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT), complemented by archival TESS photometry. Photometric and photo-polarimetric data reveal a coherent modulation at the white dwarf (WD) spin period. TESS confirms periodicities of 1307.517 s (spin) and 11.803 h (orbital). Photopolarimetric and circular spectropolarimetric measurements show circular polarisation reaching ~+5%, modulated with the WD spin period, consistent with cyclotron emission from an accreting magnetic pole. Time-resolved optical spectra display prominent Balmer (H$\\gamma$, H$\\beta$, and H$\\alpha$) and He\\textsc{ii} $\\lambda$4686 emission features and additional He\\textsc{i} emissions, all exhibiting minimal radial-velocity variations. We detect red-shifted absorption dips adjacent to the He\\textsc{ii} and H$\\beta$ lines, modulated at the WD spin period; periodogram analysis of the emission lines also yields spin modulation. These observations indicate that the system is a disc-fed, low-inclination IP. The combination of circular polarisation and spin-modulated absorption by infalling accretion curtain material supports this classification. Its comparatively long orbital period among IPs and the detection of polarised emission render 1RXS J080114.6-462324 an appealing candidate for evolutionary studies, potentially offering insight into how magnetic accretion systems evolve toward synchronism at longer orbital periods.",

Submitted to A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Aims: Studying the dynamical evolution of young clusters is crucial for a more general understanding of the star formation process. Methods: We took spectra of >600 candidate pre-main sequence (PMS) stars in several nearby young clusters (NGC 2264 N & S, Collinder 95, and Collinder 359) using MMT/Hectospec. These spectra were analyzed for H{\\alpha} emission and lithium absorption, features indicative of low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) still in their PMS evolution. We complemented these samples with YSOs identified via Gaia DR3 variability. In conjunction with Gaia astrometry, these data enable an analysis of cluster structure, kinematics and ages. In particular, we searched for halos of YSOs around our targets to test models of young cluster dynamical evolution. Results: For the NGC 2264 N & S cluster pair we identified 354 YSOs, while for Collinder 95 and 359 we identified 130 and 7 YSOs, respectively. We calculate kinematic \"traceback ages\" for YSOs in these clusters, which we compare to isochronal ages estimated using several sets of stellar evolution models. We find for NGC 2264 N & S that kinematic ages are generally smaller than their isochronal ages, which may indicate these systems remained bound for a few Myr before their current state of expansion. On the other hand, kinematic ages for Collinder 95 are often significantly larger than isochronal ages, which implies many of these YSOs did not originate from a central, dense region, leading to overestimated kinematic ages. Conclusions: We conclude that NGC 2264 N & S clusters likely formed as initially bound and compact systems, but have been gradually evaporating as cluster members become unbound, forming halos of unbound YSOs surrounding the cluster cores. We conclude that Collinder 95 likely formed initially sparse and substructured and has been dispersing since gas expulsion.",

These waves are observed to appear near the top and bottom ends of the reconnection-related CS. The simulations demonstrate the presence of termination shock regions above the two ends of the CS. As the reconnection outflows escape from the vertical CS and encounter these termination shocks, they undergo partial reflection, redirecting towards the CS terminal fork walls. The identified waves propagate rapidly at a speed of approximately 1400 km/s with a period of just 2 s. Concurrently, the time-evolution of intensity within a small region of the CS terminal fork structures, exhibits a similar oscillation period of 2 s. All these evidence supports the notion that these QFP (Quasi-periodic Fast-Propagating) waves were excited by tuning fork effects within the CS system. Essentially, the rapid reconnection outflows are reflected by the terminal shocks, striking the fork walls at the CS ends. Moreover, parts of the oscillations along the tuning fork handle are transformed into thermal energy, accumulating in the CS center and elevating the temperature. This is the first time to report such QFP waves resulting from tuning fork effects within the CS during a solar eruption. These waves are anticipated to manifest closely following the propagation of CMEs and adjacent to the related post-flare loops in observations, with partial confirmation in current observations.",

Evolution of phosphorus abundance, despite its astrophysical and biological significance, remains poorly understood due to a scarcity of observational data. By combining precise stellar parameters from the optical, a robust line selection and measurement method, we measure phosphorus abundances using available P I lines. Our analysis confirms a declining trend in [P/Fe] with increasing [Fe/H] around solar metallicity for clusters and Cepheids, consistent with previous studies. We also report a [P/Fe]-age relation among open clusters older than 1 Gyr, indicating a time-dependent enrichment pattern. Such pattern can be explained by the different stellar formation history of their parental gas, with more efficient stellar formation in the gas of older clusters (thus with higher phosphorus abundances). [P/Fe] shows a flat trend among cepheids and clusters younger than 1 Gyr (along with three Cepheids inside open clusters), possibly hinting at the phosphorus contribution from the previous-generation low-mass stars. Such trend suggests that the young clusters share a nearly common chemical history, with a mild increase in phosphorus production by low-mass stars.",

Millward, Vedad Kunovac Revised version submitted to MNRAS following referee comments Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Eclipsing brown dwarfs are important calibrators of sub-stellar evolution models used to infer the characteristics of directly imaged brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets. Only two double brown dwarf eclipsing binary systems are known, among them 2MASS J15104786-2818174 (2M1510 AB), published in 2020 with a poorly constrained orbital period. Here we analyse TESS full-frame image (FFI) photometry of this faint ($T=15.9$) binary and detect a significant (${>}10\\sigma$) periodic signal spanning TESS Cycles 1-7, consistent with previous data. We refine the orbital period to $20.897782 \\pm 0.000036$ d, reducing its present-day uncertainty from 18 h to 8 min. Our work is crucial for scheduling follow-up observations of this system for detailed study with other photometric facilities. We also find that a recent orbital solution from Doppler data is inconsistent with existing photometry. A timing offset in the Doppler data may have produced a spurious signal mimicking retrograde apsidal precession, from which the claimed circumbinary planet 2M1510 ABb was inferred. From our best attempt at correcting the data we were unable to reconcile the radial velocity data with the photometry, suggesting that the radial velocity uncertainties are underestimated, and that the circumbinary planet 2M1510 ABb may be a false positive.",

Here, we use a linearized two-fluid model to describe the influence of this collisional interaction on the properties of small-amplitude waves propagating in a uniform and static background. Mainly focusing on the case of waves generated by a periodic driver, we perform a detailed study of the dependence of the wavenumbers and damping rates on the ionization degree of the plasma, the strength of the collisional coupling, and the angle of propagation. We describe how the different wave modes (fast, slow, acoustic) are related to the individual properties of each fluid in a wide range of physical conditions. In addition, we derive analytical approximations for the damping rates due to charge-neutral collisions in the limits of weak and strong coupling and check their range of validity in comparison with the exact numerical results. These approximations can be generally applied to a large variety of astrophysical and laboratory partially ionized plasmas, but here we also discuss the particular application to plasmas only composed of hydrogen.",

PhyE2E simplifies symbolic regression by decomposing it into sub-problems using the second-order derivatives of an oracle neural network, and employs a transformer model to translate data into symbolic formulas in an end-to-end manner. The resulting formulas are refined through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers, solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions, near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another independent study. Moreover, we found physical formulas that can describe the relationships between emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun, temperatures, electron densities, and magnetic fields. The formula obtained is consistent with the properties that physicists had previously hypothesized it should possess.",

When not coupled to an external magnetohydrodynamic model, EPREM functions in an uncoupled mode where an ideal cone-shock is injected into a homogeneous background solar wind. We carried out an analysis of the effects of multiple physical parameters in producing widespread SEP events simulated by the uncoupled EPREM using a relatively simple model of a strong magnetized shock propagating radially outward through the inner heliosphere to produce the requisite MHD quantities for EPREM's sophisticated model of proton acceleration and transport. We compared a baseline simulation with seven variations in which the value of a single parameter differed from its baseline value. All simulations exhibit complex profiles of SEP flux as a function of time and energy, with clear dependence on parameters related to diffusion, mean free path, and shock profile. Moreover, while all simulations exhibit significant longitudinal spread in SEP flux, for certain parameter values there exists a decrease or absence in SEP flux at observers located $\\geq 90^\\circ$ from the shock origin. Relating the differences in SEP flux to the specific values of each parameter in the simulations provides insight into the morphology of observed SEP events and the state of the solar wind through which the driving CME propagates.",

Classification, regression, and accretion signatures of Chandra sources Nicolò Oreste Pinciroli Vago, Juan Rafael Martínez-Galarza, Roberta Amato Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG) The study of X-ray spectra is crucial to understanding the physical nature of astrophysical sources. Machine learning methods can extract compact and informative representations of data from large datasets. The Chandra Source Catalog (CSC) provides a rich archive of X-ray spectral data, which remains largely underexplored in this context. This work aims to develop a compact and physically meaningful representation of Chandra X-ray spectra using deep learning. To verify that the learned representation captures relevant information, we evaluate it through classification, regression, and interpretability analyses. We use a transformer-based autoencoder to compress X-ray spectra. The input spectra, drawn from the CSC, include only high-significance detections. Astrophysical source types and physical summary statistics are compiled from external catalogs. We evaluate the learned representation in terms of spectral reconstruction accuracy, clustering performance on 8 known astrophysical source classes, and correlation with physical quantities such as hardness ratios and hydrogen column density ($N_H$). The autoencoder accurately reconstructs spectra with 8 latent variables. Clustering in the latent space yields a balanced classification accuracy of $\\sim$40% across the 8 source classes, increasing to $\\sim$69% when restricted to AGNs and stellar-mass compact objects exclusively. Moreover, latent features correlate with non-linear combinations of spectral fluxes, suggesting that the compressed representation encodes physically relevant information. The proposed autoencoder-based pipeline is a powerful tool for the representation and interpretation of X-ray spectra, providing a compact latent space that supports both classification and the estimation of physical properties. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning for spectral studies and uncovering new patterns in X-ray data.",

FARSIDE will operate over 100~kHz to 40~MHz with 128 spatially non-co-located orthogonal pairs of antenna nodes distributed over a 12 X 12 km area in a four-arm spiral configuration. Being on the lunar farside, this radio interferometer will be deployed by tele-operated rovers. The rover deployment mode could lead to a phase offset between each of the two orthogonally polarised antenna elements in the array, which are typically co-located. In this paper, we quantify the effects of such antenna phase offsets on the polarisation response and imaging performance of the lunar radio array. Modelling and analysing the FARSIDE dipole beams with and without offset, we find the latter leads to additional leakages into Stokes U and V corresponding to Muller matrix terms of M2(0,1,2,3) and M3(0,1,2,3). Using a custom simulation pipeline to incorporate all four Stokes beams of spatially co-located and non-co-located dipoles, we produce visibilities and simulated images for the GLEAM (GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA) sky model through the FARSIDE array. We find that for a pure Stokes I input sky, the output image maximum Stokes V/I flux ratio for the offset case has increased to 2.5% versus 0.05% for the co-located case. The additional Stokes V needs to be corrected since the detection of Electron Cyclotron Maser (ECM) emissions from exoplanets requires high-fidelity Stokes V measurements.",

Mitchell, Sam Gill, Philip G. Steen, Peter Wheatley 27 pages, 25 figures, Accepted to RAS Techniques and Instruments Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Scientific CMOS cameras are becoming increasingly prevalent in modern observational astronomy. We assess the ability of CMOS image sensors technology to perform high-precision photometry with a detailed laboratory characterization of the Marana 4.2BV-11 CMOS camera. We characterise the camera in the Fastest Frame Rate (FFR) and High Dynamic Range (HDR) modes. Our evaluation includes read noise, dark current, photo response and dark signal non-uniformities, quantum efficiency and window transmittance. The read noise is found to be 1.577\\,e$^-$ for the FFR mode. For the HDR mode the read noise floor is measured to be 1.571\\,e$^-$ for signal levels below approximately 1800\\,e$^-$. The bias level shows dark signal non-uniformities with values of 0.318\\,e$^-$ and 0.232\\,e$^-$ for FFR and HDR mode, respectively. Pixel well capacity reached 2366 e$^-$pix$^{-1}$ for the FFR mode and 69026 e$^-$pix$^{-1}$ with a dynamic range of 93\\,dB for the HDR mode. The camera demonstrates good linearity, yielding linearity errors of 0.099\\,\\% for FFR mode and 0.122\\,\\% for HDR mode. The uniformity across the image arrays show a photo response non-uniformity of 0.294\\,\\% for the FFR mode and 0.131\\,\\% for the HDR mode. The dark current displays a noticeable glow pattern, resulting in mean dark current levels of $1.674\\pm0.011$\\, \\eps\\, for the FFR mode and $1.617\\pm0.008$\\,\\eps\\, for the HDR mode at a constant temperature of -25\\,$^\\circ$C. We measured the quantum efficiency across the visible spectrum, with a peak of of >95\\,\\% at 560\\,nm. Our tests indicate that the Marana CMOS camera is potentially capable of performing precise photometry.",

The foundational Declaration of Principles Concerning Activities Following the Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence, first formulated in 1989, has been widely recognised by the international scientific community. A supplemental set of draft protocols addressing the possibility of a reply to an extraterrestrial signal was prepared in 1995 by the IAA SETI Permanent Committee, with both documents presented in a position paper to the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space in 2000. In keeping with the evolving landscape of SETI research, the IAA Declaration of Principles was streamlined and updated in 2010. Recognising the need for continued adaptation, the IAA SETI Committee established a Task Group in 2022 to re-examine the protocols in light of recent advances in search methodologies, the expansion of international participation in SETI, and the increasing complexity of the global information environment. The Group recognises the living document nature of the protocols, which will require ongoing refinement to remain relevant and effective in a rapidly changing world. A draft revised Declaration of Principles was presented at the IAC 2024 in Milan, and initial feedback was received from the community, particularly members of the IAA SETI Committee. Since then, we have continued to seek broader community input in a structured process, refining the proposed updates based on further discussions and consultations. A Revised Declaration of Principles, is presented here.",

System Overview, Laboratory Testing, and On-Sky Performance Evaluation Zhongnan Dong, Bin Ma, Haoran Zhang, Jinji Li, Xu Yang, Yi Hu, Zhaohui Shang, Michael C. B. Ashley Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Infrared time-domain surveys remain significantly underdeveloped compared with their optical counterparts. We have developed the Antarctic Infrared Binocular Telescope (AIRBT) to study the dynamic infrared sky at Dome A, Antarctica, taking advantage of the superb infrared observational conditions at this site. AIRBT consists of two identical 15 cm f/3 optical tube assemblies and two cost-effective indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) cameras equipped with J and H filters, respectively. The cameras have 640 x 512 pixels with a size of 15 micrometers, providing a scale of 6.9 arcseconds per pixel and a field of view of 1.22 x 0.97 square degrees. We characterize the performance of the InGaAs cameras, including bias, readout noise, dark current, nonlinearity, and photon transfer curve. Our analysis highlights the distinct behaviors of InGaAs cameras compared with charge-coupled devices (CCDs). The bias and readout noise show temperature dependence, and the noise measured from the photon transfer curves has additional components that increase with exposure time. On-sky tests were conducted in October 2022 including system calibration, limiting depth, and photometric precision. For a single 3-second exposure, we achieved 5-sigma limiting magnitudes of 11.2 mag (Vega system) in J band and 9.7 mag in H band. The best photometric precision reached 20 millimagnitudes at the bright end, which could be further improved to sub-percent levels through image stacking. AIRBT was installed at Dome A in January 2023, and scientific observations began as soon as darkness set in.",

However, no unambiguous detection of an exoplanet has yet been demonstrated using optics with apertures smaller than 60 mm. Here, we investigated the detectability of exoplanet transits using the telescopic Optical Navigation Camera (ONC-T) onboard the Hayabusa2 spacecraft, which has an effective aperture of only 15 mm. We conducted transit observations of the hot Jupiters WASP-189 b and MASCARA-1 b, collecting data for ten and four events, respectively. The transit signal was detected with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 13 for WASP-189 b and 8 for MASCARA-1 b for each event. Stacking all events improved the SNR to 40 and 16, respectively. The transit mid-times of each event were measured with a precision of 6 minutes and were consistent with Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data to within 2 minutes. The planet-to-star radius ratio was determined with an absolute precision of 0.004 (6% relative) and agreed with TESS results to within 0.002 (3% relative). The recent ONC-T and TESS data enabled an update to the planetary ephemerides. We report a 4 sigma discrepancy between the updated orbital period of MASCARA-1 b and previously reported values. ONC-T sets a new record for the smallest-aperture instrument to detect an exoplanet transit from space, advancing the frontier of exoplanet science with miniature instrumentation. Our results suggest that optics as small as ONC-T may be capable of detecting transiting long-period Jupiters: a population that remains underrepresented in current surveys.",

West 12 pages, 6 figures, submitted to ApJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We report the discovery of NGTS-11 c, a transiting warm Neptune ($P \\approx 12.8$ d; $M_{p} = 1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2} M_{\\mathrm{Nep}}$; $R_{p} = 1.24 \\pm 0.03 R_{\\mathrm{Nep}}$), in an orbit interior to the previously reported transiting warm Saturn NGTS-11 b ($P \\approx 35.5$ d). We also find evidence of a third outer companion orbiting the K-dwarf NGTS-11. We first detected transits of NGTS-11 c in TESS light curves and confirmed them with follow-up transits from NGTS and many other ground-based facilities. Radial-velocity monitoring with the HARPS and FEROS spectrographs revealed the mass of NGTS-11 c and provides evidence for a long-period companion ($P > 2300$ d; $M_{p} \\sin i > 3.6 M_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$). Taking into account the two additional bodies in our expanded datasets, we find that the mass of NGTS-11 b ($M_{p} = 0.63 \\pm 0.09 M_{\\mathrm{Sat}}$; $R_{p} = 0.97 \\pm 0.02 R_{\\mathrm{Sat}}$) is lower than previously reported ($M_{p} = 1.2 \\pm 0.3 M_{\\mathrm{Sat}}$). Given their near-circular and compact orbits, NGTS-11 c and b are unlikely to have reached their present locations via high-eccentricity migration. Instead, they probably either formed in situ or formed farther out and then underwent disk migration. A comparison of NGTS-11 with the eight other known systems hosting multiple well-characterized warm giants shows that it is most similar to Kepler-56. Finally, we find that the commonly used 10-day boundary between hot and warm Jupiters is empirically well supported.",

      "abstract": "A formation mechanism for narrow rings around minor bodies C. Beaugé, E. Gianuzzi, N. Trógolo, A. M. Leiva, F. A. Zoppetti, M. Cerioni Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The recent discovery of narrow rings around minor bodies has raised many questions regarding their origin and current dynamics. Sharp ring boundaries seem indicative of shepherding moonlets, but none have been found. All rings lie close to spin-orbit resonances (SORs) with the central body, particularly the 1/3, even though it is not clear how these may be related. Furthermore, in at least one case the location of the ring is exterior to the Roche radius, adding to the striking differences with respect to giant planets. We study the dynamical evolution of a particle disk around a minor body, perturbed by the non-spherical component of the gravity field, particle collisions, and spin changes of the central mass linked to angular momentum conservation. By varying key parameters, we search for cases where the combined effects may lead to resonance capture and orbital configurations similar to those that have been observed. We performed N-body simulations of massless particles orbiting a central spherical body with a co-rotating mass anomaly. Collisions were modeled by adopting a simple radial damping force. Angular momentum conservation links the body spin to the disk orbital evolution. Since the gravitational effect of the test particles is neglected, this back-reaction is introduced externally assuming ad hoc spin-down rates and disk mass. Interaction between non-sphericity and collisions leads to the formation of a narrow ring that slowly recedes from the central mass. Spin-down of the minor planet shifts the SORs outward, enabling resonant capture. For suitable parameters, a portion -or all- of the initial disk can become trapped in the 1/3 SOR with the mass anomaly, in dynamically stable low-eccentricity orbits. Although the required disk mass is high ($\\ge 1\\%$ of the central body), long-term collisional erosion could reduce it to values that are consistent with observed ringlets.",

Accepted in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The Kepler mission, despite its conclusion over a decade ago, continues to offer a rich dataset for uncovering new astrophysical objects and phenomena. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive search for exocometary transit signatures within the Kepler light curves, using a machine learning approach based on a neural network trained on a library of theoretical exocomet transit light curves. By analyzing the light curves of 201,820 stars, we identified candidate events through the neural network and subjected the output to filtering and visual inspection to mitigate false positives. Our results are presented into three catalogs of increasing ambiguity. The first-tier catalog includes 17 high-confidence exocometary transit events, comprising 7 previously reported events and 10 newly identified ones, each associated with a different host star. The second-tier catalog lists 30 lower-confidence events that remain consistent with possible exocometary transits. The third-tier catalog consists of 49 more symmetric photometric events that could be either exocometary transits, exoplanet mono-transits, or false positives due to eclipsing binaries mimicking transits. Contrary to previous studies, which suggested that the cometary activity was favored by stellar youth, we find a broad age distribution among candidate host stars, including several red giants. This challenges the general idea of a decline in cometary activity with stellar age and underlines the need for further investigation into the temporal evolution of exocometary activity in planetary systems.",

Sumida, Raissa Estrela, Adriana Valio Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) M dwarfs have long been prime targets in the search for habitable exoplanets, owing to their abundance in the galaxy and the relative ease of detecting Earth-sized worlds within their narrower habitable zones. Yet, these low-mass stars can emit high-energy radiation that may gradually erode planetary atmospheres, raising concerns about long-term habitability. TOI-700, a relatively quiescent M dwarf that hosts four known planets, stands out due to its Earth-sized TOI-700 d in the star's habitable zone. Here, we assess whether a habitable environment can be sustained on TOI-700 d by analyzing different UV flux levels and atmospheric pressures. We focus on two atmospheric scenarios - one analogous to the Archean Earth and another representing a modern Earth-like environment - using a 1D photochemistry-climate model. Our results indicate that all simulated cases can maintain temperatures compatible with liquid water on the surface. However, the dominant photochemical pathways differ substantially with UV levels: under low-UV conditions, haze formation in the Archean-like atmosphere provides the main UV shielding, whereas under intensified UV, ozone production in the modern-like atmospheres can protect the surface from harmful doses. Interestingly, although haze can impede the detection of certain biosignatures, such as CH4, CO2 and O2, it also enhances the overall atmospheric signal by increasing scattering and transit depth, potentially aiding in revealing the presence of an atmosphere. These findings underscore the dual role of hazes as both a challenge for biosignature detection and a potential protection of surface habitability.",

J. 6 229 Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The deuterium to hydrogen ratio in water ice in a planetary body carries important information on the history of water processing and delivery in the protostellar nebula. For a giant planet satellite, the D/H ratio is also affected by the processes and temperatures of the circumplanetary or circumstellar environment in which the satellites formed. Here we present robust JWST spectroscopic detections of the 4.14 $\\mu$m O-D stretch absorption line (analogous to the 3 $\\mu$m water O-H stretch) on the mid-sized Saturnian satellites and use these detections to infer a D/H ratio on each satellite. Within the limitations of the technique, we find that all of the satellites are consistent with having a D/H ratio of about $1.5 \\times$ Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW), which is about an order of magnitude higher than the value of the atmosphere of Saturn. A much higher previously reported D/H ratio for Phoebe is ruled out at the 10$\\sigma$ level, and a 3$\\sigma$ upper limit of 2.3 $\\times$ VSMOW is obtained. The elevated D/H ratios demonstrate that the solid planetesimals and pebbles that built the satellites never sublimed and re-equilibrated with the gaseous circumplanetary disk. The similarity of the D/H measurements across all satellites suggest that the D/H ratio of water ice in the vicinity of Saturn at the time of satellite formation was also approximately 1.5 $\\times$ VSMOW.",

Full abstract in the article. All data used to produce the results presented in this article are publicly available at the following link: this https URL Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The Near InfraRed Planet Searcher (NIRPS) joined HARPS on the 3.6-m ESO telescope at La Silla Observatory in April 2023, dedicating part of its Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) program to the radial velocity follow-up of TESS planet candidates to confirm and characterize transiting planets around M dwarfs. We report the first results of this program with the characterization of the TOI-756 system, which consists of TOI-756 b, a transiting sub-Neptune candidate detected by TESS, as well as TOI-756 c, an additional non-transiting planet discovered by NIRPS and HARPS. TOI-756 b is a 1.24-day period sub-Neptune with a radius of 2.81 $\\pm$ 0.10 $R_\\oplus$ and a mass of 9.8$^{+1.8}_{-1.6}$ $M_\\oplus$. TOI-756 c is a cold eccentric (e$_c$ = 0.45 $\\pm$ 0.01) giant planet orbiting with a period of 149.6 days around its star with a minimum mass of 4.05 $\\pm$ 0.11 $M_\\mathrm{jup}$. Additionally, a linear trend of 146$~\\mathrm{m\\,s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ is visible in the radial velocities, hinting at a third component, possibly in the planetary or brown dwarf regime. This system is unique in the exoplanet landscape, standing as the first confirmed example of such a planetary architecture around an M dwarf. With a density of 2.42 $\\pm$ 0.49 g cm$^{-3}$, the inner planet, TOI-756 b, is a volatile-rich sub-Neptune. Assuming a pure H/He envelope, we inferred an atmospheric mass fraction of 0.023 and a core mass fraction of 0.27, which is well constrained by stellar refractory abundances derived from NIRPS spectra. It falls within the still poorly explored radius cliff and at the lower boundary of the Neptune desert, making it a prime target for a future atmospheric characterization with JWST to improve our understanding of this population.",

Martin, Sean Smallets, Grace Masiello, Liz Bergeron Under review at ApJ, community feedback welcome Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Confirmation of the first exomoon remains elusive. Although several exomoon candidates exist around single stars, there are currently no candidates around circumbinary planets (CBPs). Most circumbinary planets are thought to form far from the host binary and migrate through the protoplanetary disc. Therefore, an exomoon of a CBP represents a fascinating yet complex and evolving four-body system. Their existence (or absence) would shed light on the robustness of moon formation and evolution in dynamically active planetary systems. In this work, we simulate the orbital evolutions of exomoons around migrating CBPs. We show that for fully migrated CBPs, a moon is capable of surviving the migration if it is formed within $\\sim5-10\\%$ of the planet's Hill Radius, well within the currently proposed range at which moons are thought to settle in the planetary disc for giant planets. Even though all known CBPs are gas giants, 18\\% of the surviving moons in our sample are within the habitable zone, giving credence to circumbinary habitability, albeit hosted by moons rather than planets. $38\\%$ of moons escape their host planet early in the migration and become long-period CBPs (i.e a multi-planet circumbinary system). Nearly one-third of exomoons collide with their host planet, and $1\\%$ are ejected from the system entirely. This last class presents another pathway for producing free-floating planetary mass objects, like those discovered recently and expected from the Roman microlensing survey.",

We extend previous studies to revise the maximum lifetime of these objects due to planetary, lunar and sublunar tidal migration. Using the Euler-Lagrange equation with a tidal dissipation process as specified by the Constant Geometric Lag model, we derive and solve the governing equations numerically to map the semi-major axis parameter space for star-planet-moon-submoon systems in which the submoon could be massive enough to host life. We find that Earth could have hosted asteroid-sized submoons ($\\sim10^{15}\\mathrm{kg}$), whereas a submoon near the previously proposed upper limit ($\\sim4.6\\cdot10^{17}\\mathrm{kg}$) would have driven the Moon $\\sim30\\%$ farther from Earth than its current orbit. A Warm Jupiter system like Kepler1625 has greater potential of hosting a massive submoon. We found that a submoon of around $10\\%M_{\\text{Luna}}$ could survive if Kepler1625b's hypothesized moon were $68\\%$ farther away then what the best-fit model suggests ($67R_{\\mathrm{p}}$ instead of $40R_{\\mathrm{p}}$). Giant submoons of mass $1.8M_{\\oplus}$ are stable in a Kepler1625-like system. In these cases, the moon orbit is wide ($> 100R_{\\mathrm{p}}$). Decreasing the submoon mass to a habitability prerequisite of $0.5M_{\\oplus}$, likely needed for a stable atmosphere and plate tectonics, leads to a smaller total number of stable iterations relative to the $m_{sm}=1.8M_{\\oplus}$ case. In fact, we identified a minimum number of stable iterations on intermediate submoon mass-scales of around $0.1M_{\\oplus}$. This is likely due to an interplay between small tidal forces at small submoon masses and small Roche-Limits at very high submoon masses. If submoon formation pathways in Warm Jupiter systems prefer such intermediate mass-scales, habitable submoons could be a rare phenomenon.",

Konopacky, Jayke S. Nguyen, Patrick Diamond, Krzysztof Goździewski, Dawid Jankowski 34 pages, 21 figures. Accepted to ApJ. Updated references Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Direct imaging has revealed exoplanet systems hosting multiple wide-orbit Super-Jupiters, where planet-planet interactions can shape their long-term dynamical evolution. These strong perturbations may lead to orbital instability, raising questions about the long-term survival of such systems. Shortly after formation, planet-disk interactions can shepherd planets into mean-motion resonances, which may promote long-term stability as seen in HR 8799. However, early-stage processes such as disk photoevaporation and viscosity can influence these outcomes. The $\\sim$5 Myr-old PDS 70 system offers a unique laboratory to investigate these processes: its two massive ($>$4 $M_{Jup}$), wide-orbit ($>$20 AU) giants are still embedded in their natal disk. We perform 2D hydrodynamic simulations of the system, allowing the disk to disperse via photoevaporation. Once the disk dissipates, we continue to track the planets' orbital evolution over Gyr timescales using N-body simulations. We find that the system is likely to remain stable for $>$ 1 Gyr. To assess the importance of disk-driven evolution, we compare these results with disk-free N-body simulations using orbital parameters constrained by orbit fits that include recent relative astrometry and radial velocities from the literature. In this case, we find that only $\\lesssim 4\\%$ of posterior is stable for 100 Myr, highlighting the importance of considering disk-driven evolution for long-term dynamics stability of exoplanetary systems. We also simulate two three-planet configurations including the proposed inner candidate \"PDS 70 d\", finding that a higher photoevaporation leads the system to become unstable in $<$ 10 Myr.",
