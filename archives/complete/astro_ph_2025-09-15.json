To enhance sensitivity to this targeted population, we incorporate a redshift-corrected population model based on radio observations of Galactic double neutron star systems. The search identifies a significant trigger with a false-alarm rate of about one per 50 years and a network signal-to-noise ratio of 9.7, which was first reported by the LVK in low-latency processing as S231109ci and subsequently in the GWTC-4.0 catalog as GW231109_235456, a sub-threshold candidate. Accounting for a trials factor of five from the four LVK searches in GWTC-4.0 and this new search, the false-alarm rate of the reported candidate is approximately one per 10 years. If this event is of astrophysical origin, the inferred source properties indicate component masses of 1.40 to 2.24 solar masses for the primary and 0.97 to 1.49 solar masses for the secondary, yielding a total mass of 2.95 (+0.38, -0.07) solar masses. The event was localized to a region of 450 square degrees (90 percent probability) at a luminosity distance of 165 (+70, -69) megaparsecs.",

Lasky, Eric Thrane High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Current population models of binary black hole distributions are difficult to interpret because standard population inferences hinge on modeling choices, which can mask or mimic real structure. The maximum population likelihood ``$\\pistroke$ formalism'' provides a means to investigate and interpret features in the distribution of binary black holes using only data -- without specifying a population model. It tells us if features inferred from current population models are truly present in the data or if they arise from model misspecification. It also provides guidance for developing new models by highlighting previously unnoticed features. In this study, we utilize the $\\pistroke$ formalism to examine the binary black hole population in the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA (LVK) fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4). Our analysis supports the existence of a gap around $45\\,M_\\odot$ in the secondary black hole mass distribution and identifies a widening in the distribution of the effective inspiral spin parameter $\\chi_\\text{eff}$ near this mass as recently reported by Tong et al. (2025). Similar to earlier studies, we find support for an anti-correlation between $\\chi_\\text{eff}$ and mass ratio. However, we argue that this may be a spurious correlation arising from misspecification of the joint distribution of black hole masses. Furthermore, we identify support for dimensionless black hole spin magnitudes at approximately $\\chi \\approx 0.2$ and $\\chi\\approx0.7$. The data support the existence of a correlation between the spin magnitudes $\\chi_1$ and $\\chi_2$, though subsequent study is required to determine if this feature is statistically significant. The accompanying data release includes $\\pistroke$ samples, which can be used to compare theoretical predictions to LVK data and to assess assumptions in parameterised models.",

See Supplemental Material in the ancillary files section High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas, merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets. Here we report on a numerical simulation that covers the late inspiral, merger, and initial postmerger phase of such a system where both black holes have the same mass and spin, and both spin axes are parallel to the orbital angular momentum. The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau. Such a distinct lightcurve should aid efforts to identify supermassive black hole mergers, with or without accompanying gravitational wave detections.",

Arun 14 pages, 8 Figures and 2 Tables High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) As the compact binary catalog continues to grow rapidly, developing and refining tests to probe the nature of compact objects is essential for a comprehensive understanding of both the observed data and the underlying astrophysics of the binary population. We investigate the effectiveness of spin-induced multipole moments (SIQM) and tidal deformability measurements in distinguishing lower mass-gap black hole (BH) binaries from non-BH binaries with different mass and spin configurations. We perform model-agnostic tests on binary BH (BBH) simulations using full Bayesian inference, evaluating the independent and joint measurability of SIQM and tidal parameters across the parameter space. We extend the analysis to simulations of self-interacting spinning boson stars, using synthetic signals that exhibit (a) both SIQM and tidal effects and (b) each effect individually. For case (a), recovery is performed using (i) a BBH model, (ii) a model incorporating both SIQM and tidal effects, and (iii) models including either SIQM or tidal effects. For case (b), we employ (i) a BBH model and (ii) models incorporating either SIQM or tidal effects, consistent with the injection. Simulations employ TaylorF2 waveform model and consider binaries in the low mass gap with varying spin magnitudes. We find that employing an incorrect model to analyze the signal can lead to biases in parameter inference. Notably, when analyzing a simulated binary boson star-like signal with component masses $\\rm{(4, 4) \\, M_{\\odot}}$ using a BBH model, the system is incorrectly identified as having masses $\\rm{(8, 2) \\, M_{\\odot}}$. In contrast, using the correct recovery model that includes both SIQM and tidal deformability effects successfully recovers the true masses, highlighting the significance of waveform model accuracy in performing reliable distinguishability tests for compact objects in the low-mass gap.",

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) With the recent announcement by NASA's \\textit{Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey 2023-2032}, a priority flagship mission to the planet Uranus is anticipated. Here, we explore the prospects of using the mission's radio Doppler tracking equipment to detect gravitational waves (GWs) and other analogous signals related to dark matter (DM) over the duration of its interplanetary cruise. We develop a methodology to stack tracking data and account for time varying detector geometry, thereby constructing the sensitivity of the mission to GWs over the wide frequency range of $3\\times 10^{-9}$ Hz to $10^{-4}$ Hz. We find that the mission has the potential to fill the gap between pulsar timing and space-based-interferometry GW observatories. If improvements in reducing \\textit{Cassini} era noise by a factor of $\\sim$10 are implemented, we forecast the detection of $\\mathcal{\\mathcal{O}}(\\rm{few})$ individual massive black hole binaries using two independent population models. Additionally, we determine the mission's sensitivity to both astrophysical and primordial stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, as well as its capacity to test, or even confirm via detection, ultralight DM models. In all these cases, the tracking of the spacecraft over its interplanetary cruise would enable coverage of unexplored regions of parameter space, where signals from new phenomena in our Universe may be lurking.",

Patra, Bharat Kumar Accepted for publication in Physics of the Dark Universe High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th) In this study, we investigate the impacts of dark matter (DM) on the properties of both static and rotating neutron stars utilizing a self-interacting DM model, motivated by the neutron decay anomaly. DM-admixed NSs are modeled by assuming chemical equilibrium between ordinary matter and the dark sector, treating a single-fluid Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) framework. By treating the DM interaction strength ($G$) as a free parameter, we explore its influence on NS properties, considering a broad range of equations of state (EoSs). Using the mass-radius constraints from NICER pulsar measurements, we constrain the DM interaction strength for each EoS via a likelihood analysis. Extending this model to rotating NSs, we analyze how centrifugal forces associated with increasing angular velocity ($\\Omega$) enhance both mass and radius, causing deformation. We assess the impact of DM on rotational deformation by calculating the eccentricity, highlighting the interplay between DM and rotational forces. Since both DM and rotation simultaneously influence NS properties, we compute the relative changes in mass and radius across varying $G$ and $\\Omega$ values to quantify their combined effects.",

From our most restrictive data set, P18+lensing+non-CMB, for the $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ parameterization, we obtain $w_0=-0.879\\pm 0.060$, $w_a=-0.39^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$, the asymptotic limit $w(z\\to\\infty) = w_0+w_a=-1.27^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$, and $A_L=1.078^{+0.036}_{-0.040}$ (all $1\\sigma$ errors). This joint analysis of CMB and non-CMB data favors DE dynamics over a cosmological constant at $\\sim 1\\sigma$ and $A_L>1$ at $\\sim 2\\sigma$, i.e. more smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data than is predicted by the best-fit model. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$ the evidence in favor of DE dynamics is larger, $\\sim 2\\sigma$, suggesting that at least part of the evidence for DE dynamics comes from the excess smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$, there is a difference of $2.8\\sigma$ between P18 and non-CMB cosmological parameter constraints and $2.7\\sigma$ between P18+lensing and non-CMB constraints. When $A_L$ is allowed to vary these tensions reduced to $1.9\\sigma$ and $2.1\\sigma$ respectively. Our P18+lensing+non-CMB data compilation positively favors the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization without and with a varying $A_L$ parameter over the flat $\\Lambda$CDM model, and $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ is also positively favored over $w_0w_a$CDM.",

The constellation employs three spacecraft that exchange laser beams to form interferometric measurements over a distance of 2.5 million kilometers. The measurements will then be telemetered down to Earth at a lower sampling frequency. Anti-aliasing filters will be used on board to limit spectral folding of out-of-band laser noise. The dominant noise in these measurements is laser frequency noise which does not cancel naturally in LISA's unequal-arm heterodyne interferometers. Suppression of this noise requires time-shifting of the data using delay operators to build virtual beam paths that simulate equal-arm interferometers. The non-commutativity of these delay operators and on-board filters manifests as a noise (flexing-filtering) that significantly contributes to the noise budget. This non-commutativity is a consequence of the non-flatness of the filter in-band. Attenuation of this noise requires high-order and computationally expensive filters, putting additional demands on the spacecraft. The following work studies an alternative method to reduce this flexing filtering noise via the introduction of a modified delay operator that accounts for the non-commutativity with the filter in the delay operation itself. Our approach allows us to reduce the flexing-filtering noise by over six orders of magnitude whilst reducing the dependency on the flatness of the filter. The work is supplemented by numerical simulations of the data processing chain that compare the results with those of the standard approach.",

This allows for black hole evolutionary tracks as a function of redshift, combining formation, accretion, and merger histories for the variety of black hole populations. A realistic black hole continuum constructed from initial mass and spin functions and approximate redshift evolution reveals possible black hole main sequences, such as sustained coherent accretion through cosmic time or hierarchical merger trees. In the stellar-mass regime, we use a binary population synthesis software to compare three spin prescriptions for tidal evolution of Wolf-Rayet progenitors, showing how the mass--spin diagram exposes interesting modeling differences. We then classify black hole populations by applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to mass--spin datasets. While bare unsupervised clustering can nearly recover canonical population boundaries (stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive), a more sophisticated approach utilizing deep learning via variational autoencoders for latent space representation learning aids in clustering of realistic datasets with subclasses that highly overlap in mass--spin space. We find that a supervised random forest can accurately recover the correct clusters from the learned latent space representation depending on the complexity of the underlying dataset, semi-supervised methods show potential for further development, and the performance of unsupervised classifiers is a great challenge. Our findings motivate future machine learning applications and demonstrate that the mass--spin diagram can be used to connect gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations with theoretical models.",

Montero-Dorta 12 pages, 8 figures, submitted to A&A Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Recent efforts to identify secondary variations in the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) have primarily focused on simulations examining the role of large-scale cosmic environments such as superclusters, filaments, and underdense regions or voids. If present, these variations could yield valuable insights into galaxy formation mechanisms, halo assembly processes, and the influence of external factors on cosmic structure. We aim to test whether secondary trends in the HOD driven by the large-scale structure of the Universe are detectable observationally. In particular, we examine whether the HOD depends on distance to key features of the cosmic web by explicitly quantifying these spatial relationships. We also analyze whether HODs vary across different cosmic environments, defined by critical point classifications, and assess the influence of intrinsic galaxy properties such as central galaxy color. We create volume-limited galaxy samples from SDSS-DR18 and use a group catalog to determine halo masses and identify central and satellite membership. Additionally, we employ a DisPerSE catalog to locate critical points such as maxima, minima, and filaments in the cosmic web. We evaluate how the HOD varies with proximity to these features and across five distinct cosmic environments. We further examine trends related to the color of central galaxies and test the robustness of our results with alternative DisPerSE catalogs generated using different smoothing scales and persistence thresholds. Our analysis shows that large-scale environments only weakly influence the HOD. However, second-order dependencies may be revealed through a multivariate approach that combines local and large-scale metrics with intrinsic galaxy properties. Future work with next-generation surveys and advanced modeling may achieve the precision required to detect and characterize these subtle environmental correlations.",

Iliev Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) While cosmic reionization has been broadly constrained by global observables, the interplay between internal sources (Milky Way, M31, and their satellites) and external ionization fronts remains poorly understood in a realistic Local Group (LG) context. To address this issue, we perform radiative transfer post-processing on the original HESTIA LG constrained simulation. We calibrate our source models using a uniform 1024^3 particle, dark-matter only, HESTIA simulation coupled with a subgrid collapse-fraction model to match the global reionization observables. These source models are then applied to the HESTIA zoom-in simulations, which consist of a 4096^3 particle effective resolution in the zoom region centered on the Milky Way (MW) and M31 haloes, which resolves haloes down to 10^8 solar masses. We find that in all scenarios, reionization within the LG proceeds in an inside-out manner with the progenitors of the MW and M31 having 50 percent of their material ionized by z ~ 9-8.6, significantly earlier than the global midpoint at z ~ 7-7.7, noting that external fronts from large-scale structure play a negligible role, even under the most permissive feedback model. We further show that present-day satellite galaxies exhibit only a weak correlation between their reionization redshift and their present-day radial distance from their host halo, with somewhat tighter trends around M31 than the MW. Finally, we find that satellites which assembled before reionization are systematically more massive today, suggesting that the oldest stellar populations preferentially reside in the most massive subhaloes.",

Kay, Joop Schaye, Matthieu Schaller Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) In anticipation of upcoming cosmological surveys, we use the large volume Flamingo hydrodynamical simulations to look for signatures of dynamical activity, focusing on the hot gas profiles of groups and clusters out to redshift $z=1$. To determine the dynamical state of each object, we consider the halo mass accretion rate, $\\Gamma$, as well as three observational proxies: stellar mass gap, $\\Mstar$; X-ray concentration, $c_\\mathrm{x}$, and X-ray centroid shift, $\\left<w\\right>$. In general, the median values of these indicators vary in accordance with an increase in dynamical activity with both mass and redshift. We find $\\left<w\\right>$ to be the most reliable proxy, while $c_\\mathrm{x}$ and $\\Mstar$ are more sensitive to resolution and feedback model details. Looking at the profiles, the correlation between dark matter density and $\\Gamma$ has a characteristic radial dependence, being negatively (positively) correlated at small (large) radii. This trend is insensitive to both halo mass and redshift. Similar behaviour is also seen for the hot gas densities in low redshift clusters, particularly when using $\\left<w\\right>$, but the correlations become weaker in groups, at higher redshift and when stronger feedback is employed. We also find the intrinsic scatter in the gas density profiles to decrease with redshift, particularly in groups, contrary to what is seen for the dark matter. Interestingly, the radius of minimum gas density scatter increases with feedback strength, suggesting that this property could be a useful feedback diagnostic in future observational studies.",

Accepted for publication in MNRAS Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) X-rays emitted by high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) and supernovae-driven winds in the first galaxies during Cosmic Dawn are expected to warm the intergalactic medium prior to its reionization. While most of the heating will be uniform on measurable scales, exceptionally bright sources will produce a warm ring around them with a distinctive 21-cm signature. The detection of such systems would confirm X-rays are a source of IGM heating during Cosmic Dawn and provide a test of models predicting higher X-ray luminosities per star formation rate compared with present-day galaxies. We illustrate the effect for a star-forming galaxy in a $10^{11}\\, M_\\odot$ halo at $z=12$, treating the photoionizing radiation and X-rays using a novel fully time-dependent 3D ray-tracing radiative transfer code. We consider a range in possible spectra for the HMXBs and star formation efficiencies, as well as the possible effect of an extended halo around the galaxy. We find detection of the signal would require integration times of a few thousand hours using SKA1-Low except for a bright galaxy like a starburst, but only a thousand hours for the expected noise levels of SKA2-Low. Depending on the surrounding gas density profile, the 21-cm signature of X-ray heating may still require an exceptionally high star formation rate, either intrinsic to the source or provided by other systems clustered near it, to avoid dominance of the signal by absorption from the surrounding gas.",

Furthermore, in a spatially closed universe, these wave vectors are independently constrained to be integers. Matching these two distinct quantization conditions provides a novel theoretical constraint on the possible values of spatial curvature. In this work, we numerically solve the cosmological perturbation equations, incorporating radiation anisotropy and higher-order Boltzmann terms, to calculate these discrete wave vectors with improved precision. Subsequently, we generate Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectra for different characteristic spacings of these quantized wave vectors. Finally, we apply the constraint to Planck 2018 observational data to determine the cosmological parameters. This analysis yields a discrete set of allowed values for the spatial curvature, $\\Omega_K$, including $[-0.076,-0.039, -0.024, -0.016, -0.012, \\dots]$.",

Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) In this paper, we investigate the critical collapse leading to primordial black hole (PBH) formation in a universe dominated by a self-interacting scalar field with a quartic potential, comparing it to the well-known radiation-dominated case. Using fully relativistic nonlinear numerical simulations in spherical symmetry, based on the Misner--Sharp formalism, we analyze the dynamics near the collapse threshold and track the scaling of the black hole mass. Our results confirm that both the scalar field and radiation cases exhibit type II critical behavior with similar -- though not identical -- critical exponents, differing by about $2\\sigma$. This suggests that, while a quartic scalar field effectively mimics a radiation fluid even in the nonlinear collapse regime, small differences in the critical exponent persist. Our findings provide direct numerical evidence for the near universality of the critical exponent in PBH formation, with only mild dependence on whether the collapse is driven by a scalar field or a perfect fluid.",

We confront the uncertain landscape by jointly analyzing new measurements of the gas distribution around groups and clusters -- DESI+ACT kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect profiles and eROSITA X-ray gas masses -- with mean halo masses characterized by galaxy-galaxy lensing. Across a wide range of halo masses ($M_{500}=10^{13-14}M_\\odot$) and redshifts ($0<z<1$), we find evidence of more efficient gas expulsion beyond several $R_{500}$ than predicted by most state-of-the-art simulations. A like-with-like comparison reveals all kSZ and X-ray observations are inconsistent with the fiducial 1 Gpc$^{3}$ hydrodynamical FLAMINGO simulation, which was calibrated to reproduce pre-eROSITA X-ray gas fractions: eROSITA X-ray gas fractions are $2\\times$ lower than the simulation, and the kSZ measurements are combined $>8 \\sigma$ discrepant. The FLAMINGO simulation variant with the most gas expulsion, and therefore the most suppression of the matter power spectrum relative to a dark matter only simulation, provides a good description of how much gas is expelled and how far it extends; the enhanced gas depletion is achieved by more powerful but less frequent AGN outbursts. Joint kSZ, X-ray, and lensing measurements form a consistent picture of gas expulsion beyond several $R_{500}$, implying a more suppressed matter power spectrum than predicted by most recent simulations. Complementary observables and next-generation simulations are critical to understanding the physical mechanism behind this extreme gas expulsion and mapping its impact on the large-scale matter distribution.",

Observed at a redshift of z=5.39 and z=5.11 respectively, and with stellar masses of $\\rm 10^{9.6}M_\\odot$ and $\\rm 10^{9.5}M_\\odot$, GS-z5-Q1 and COS-z5-Q1 are two of the most distant quiescent galaxies spectroscopically confirmed to-date, and are by far the least massive ($\\sim10\\times$ lower mass). Full spectrophotometric modelling reveals that COS-z5-Q1 appears to have quenched more than 300Myr prior to observation ($z\\sim 7$) and has a formation redshift of around z$\\sim$11, whilst GS-z5-Q1 formed and quenched in a single burst around 150Myr prior to observation ($z\\sim6$). GS-z5-Q1 is found to lie near the centre of a known high-z overdensity in GOODS-S, as would be expected by galaxy formation models, while COS-z5-Q1 lies towards the outskirts of an overdense region. This highlights the role that environment could play in accelerating galaxy evolutionary processes and could possibly be linked to the galaxies' quiescent nature. By modelling their stellar populations, we show that these types of low-mass quiescent galaxies could potentially be descendants of the higher-z \"mini-quenched\" galaxies. The discovery of these two low-mass $z>5$ quiescent galaxies illuminates a previously undiscovered galaxy population and motivates dedicated follow-up surveys to investigate the overall population.",

Submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present the first infrared spectral predictions from a self-consistent simulation of the formation of a quasar in a starburst galaxy, spanning cosmological to innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) scales. The infrared emission is dominated by a torus-like dust structure composed of the highly magnetized, turbulence-supported outer accretion disk and of accreting gas tidally torn from the interstellar medium (ISM). At these early stages, the AGN is buried and Compton-thick. The near- to mid-IR escaping luminosity varies by almost an order of magnitude across sightlines, largely due to extinction from the inflowing stream of cold dust. Self-absorption within the torus suppresses silicate emission features, and further reprocessing by the ambient ISM leads to prominent silicate absorption and colder IR emission. The sublimation structure is stratified by composition and size, producing sightline-dependent extinction curves that intrinsically vary in shape. However, after repeated scattering in the optically thick dusty medium, these curves emerge substantially grayed. We also demonstrate that bipolar outflows from the central black hole that carve biconical cavities and reveal the central engine in later stages can preserve IR anisotropy and silicate features. These results suggest that dusty starburst quasars can undergo a buried, IR-bright phase early in their evolution.",

In preparation for this new era, we assemble an extensive compilation of SL candidate systems from the literature, comprising over 30,000 unique objects that can be used as a watch list of known systems.

This sample, dubbed the \"Last Stand Before Rubin\" (LaStBeRu), has a myriad of applications, from using archival data to selections for follow-up projects and training of machine learning algorithms. As an application, we perform a test of General Relativity using these data, combining the effects of motion of massless particles (through SL modeling) and non-relativistic bodies through $\\sigma_v$, which allow one to set constraints on the Post-Newtonian parameter $\\gamma_\\mathrm{PPN}$. Using the LaStBeRu database, we present an independent test of $\\gamma_\\mathrm{PPN}$ (distinct from previous analyses) and, for the first time, we present such a test exclusively with systems identifiable in ground-based images.

The procedure hinges on reconstructing the radial positions of sources by relating the observed frequency to the rest-frame frequency of a target emission line. However, this step is hindered by `interloper-line' emission from different cosmological volumes that redshifts into the same observed frequency. In this work, we propose a model-independent technique to remove the contamination of line interlopers using their statistical correlation with external tracers of the large-scale structure, and identify the weights that minimize the variance of the cleaned field. Furthermore, we derive expressions for the resulting power spectra after applying our cleaning procedure, and validate them against simulations. We find that the cleaning performance improves as the correlation between the line interlopers and the external tracer increases, resulting in a gain in the signal-to-noise ratio of up to a factor 6 (2) for the auto- (cross-)power spectrum in idealized scenarios. This approach has the advantage of being model-independent, and is highly complementary to other techniques, as it removes large-scale clustering modes instead of individually masking the brightest sources of contamination.",

Bayer, Jia Liu Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We study the cosmological information contained in the cosmic web, categorized as four structure types: nodes, filaments, walls, and voids, using the Quijote simulations and a modified nexus+ algorithm. We show that splitting the density field by the four structure types and combining the power spectrum in each provides much tighter constraints on cosmological parameters than using the power spectrum without splitting. We show the rich information contained in the cosmic web structures -- related to the Hessian of the density field -- for measuring all of the cosmological parameters, and in particular for constraining neutrino mass. We study the constraints as a function of Fourier scale, configuration space smoothing scale, and the underlying field. For the matter field with $k_{\\rm max}=0.5\\,h/{\\rm Mpc}$, we find a factor of $\\times20$ tighter constraints on neutrino mass when using smoothing scales larger than 12.5~Mpc/$h$, and $\\times80$ tighter when using smoothing scales down to 1.95~Mpc/$h$. However, for the CDM+Baryon field we observe a more modest $\\times1.7$ or $\\times3.6$ improvement, for large and small smoothing scales respectively.

Grasshorn Gebhardt, Chen Heinrich, Olivier Doré 15+7 pages, 13 figures, added discussion of boundary conditions Phys. Rev. D 112, 063518 (2025) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Current and upcoming large-scale structure surveys place stringent requirements on the mitigation of observational systematics in order to achieve their unprecedented constraining power. In this work, we investigate the potential use of the spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) power spectrum in controlling systematics, leveraging its capability of disentangling angular and radial scales. We first clarify how the discrete SFB basis describes radial scales via the index $n$ and demonstrate that the SFB power spectrum reduces to the clustering wedge $P(k,\\mu)$ in the plane-parallel limit, enabling it to inherit results from past literature based on the clustering wedge. While the parallel and perpendicular Fourier mode $(k_{||}, k_\\perp)$ decomposition underlying the wedge is only valid for surveys of small angular coverage with a well-defined global line-of-sight, the SFB basis provides a natural generalization that can be applied to the full sky. Crucially, the separation of angular and radial scales allows systematics to be localized in SFB space. In particular, systematics with broad and smooth radial distributions primarily concentrate in the $n=0$ modes corresponding to the largest radial scales. This localization behavior enables one to selectively remove only particular angular and radial modes contaminated by systematics. This is in contrast to standard 3D clustering analyses of wide-field surveys based on power spectrum multipoles, where systematic effects necessitate the removal of all modes below a given $k_{\\rm min}$. Our findings advocate for adopting the SFB basis in 3D clustering analyses where systematics have become a limiting factor.",

In this work, we investigate their impact on full-shape clustering analysis using contaminated mock catalogs. We find that redshift uncertainty introduces a scale-dependent damping effect on the power spectrum, which is absorbed by counterterms in clustering model, keeping parameter biases below $5\\%$. Catastrophic failures suppress the power spectrum amplitude by an approximately constant factor that scales with the catastrophic rate~$f_c$. While this effect is negligible for DESI galaxy populations ($f_c=1\\%$), the slitless-like errors, combining redshift uncertainty with $f_c=5\\%$ catastrophics, introduce significant biases in cosmological constraints. In this case, we observe $6\\%$ to $16\\%$ shifts ($\\sim2.2\\sigma$ level) in estimating the fractional growth rate $df\\equiv f/f^{\\rm{fid}}$ and the log primordial amplitude $\\ln(10^{10} A_{s})$. Applying a correction factor $(1-f_c)^2$ on the galaxy power spectrum mitigates the bias but weakens the parameter constraints due to new degeneracies. Alternatively, fixing $f_c$ to its expected value during fitting successfully restores the unbiased posterior without loss of constraint. Our results indicate that for space-based slitless surveys such as \\textit{Euclid}, at minimum accurate estimation of $f_c$ and its incorporation into the clustering model are essential to get unbiased cosmological inference. Extending to evolving dark energy and massive neutrino cosmologies, redshift errors do not bias the dark energy properties parametrized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, but can degrade constraints on the summed neutrino mass $\\sum m_\\nu$ by up to $80\\%$ in the worst case.",

Wise 50 pages, including 27 figures and 15 tables (with Appendix). Submitted to MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), particularly those detected by wide-field instruments such as the Fermi/GBM, pose a challenge for optical follow-up due to their large initial localisation regions, leaving many GRBs without identified afterglows. The Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO), with its wide field of view, dual-site coverage, and robotic rapid-response capability, bridges this gap by rapidly identifying and localising afterglows from alerts issued by space-based facilities including Fermi, SVOM, Swift, and the EP, providing early optical positions for coordinated multi-wavelength follow-up. In this paper, we present optical afterglow localisation and multi-band follow-up of seven Fermi/GBM and MAXI/GSC triggered long GRBs (240122A, 240225B, 240619A, 240910A, 240916A, 241002B, and 241228B) discovered by GOTO in 2024. Spectroscopy for six GRBs (no spectroscopic data for GRB 241002B) with VLT/X-shooter and GTC/OSIRIS yields precise redshifts spanning $z\\approx0.40-$3.16 and absorption-line diagnostics of host and intervening systems. Radio detections for four events confirm the presence of long-lived synchrotron emission. Prompt-emission analysis with Fermi and MAXI data reveals a spectrally hard population, with two bursts lying $>3\\sigma$ above the Amati relation. Although their optical afterglows resemble those of typical long GRBs, the prompt spectra are consistently harder than the long-GRB average. Consistent modelling of six GOTO-discovered GRB afterglows yields jet half-opening angles of a few degrees and beaming-corrected kinetic energies ($E_{jet}\\sim10^{51-52}$) erg, consistent with the canonical long-GRB population. These findings suggest that optical discovery of poorly localised GRBs may be subject to observational biases favouring luminous events with high spectral peak energy, while also providing insight into jet microphysics and central engine diversity.",

After the outburst, similar to the outbursts in 2015 and 2017, the source decayed into a quiescent state. Two out of three XMM-Newton observations conducted after the 2023 outburst confirmed the source to be in a low-luminosity state at a level of $L_{\\rm X} \\sim 10^{33}\\,\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}$. X-ray pulsations were detected at $\\approx$0.277 Hz in both observations with a pulsed fraction exceeding 50%. The power density spectra show no significant low-frequency red noise in both observations, suggesting that the radiation is not driven by accretion. The energy spectra in this state can be described by a single blackbody component, with an emitting area smaller than the typical size of the polar caps during the accretion phase. Based on the timing and spectral properties, we suggest that the propeller effect is active during the quiescent state, resulting in a total quenching of accretion. We discuss possible mechanisms for the generation of pulsations in this regime and consider the scenario of neutron star crust cooling.",

We solve the linearized magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) equations in the non-relativistic regime by Laplace transform in time and Fourier transform in space. In this formulation all unstable modes with the same translational and azimuthal wave numbers can be obtained simultaneously by searching for pole singularities in the complex plane. In order to determine unambiguously their driving mechanisms, we evaluate the second-order perturbation of the MHD Hamiltonian for individual eigenfunctions derived at these singular points. We identify in our non-rotating models the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) as one of the shear-driven modes and the current-driven instability such as the kink instability (KKI). In rotational models we also find the magnetorotational instability (MRI) as another shear-driven mode.

In the GeV band, it had previously been detected only up to a few GeV, with the extrapolation of the TeV spectrum overestimating the measured GeV flux. Using over 17 years of Fermi-LAT observations, we report the first detection of PSR B1259-63 in the 10 GeV to $\\gtrsim 100$ GeV range, from -400 to +100 days relative to periastron. The Fermi-LAT spectrum is well described by a hard power law with index $\\Gamma = 1.9 \\pm 0.1$, and has a flux level consistent with that measured at TeV energies by H.E.S.S. The apparent transition from the hard Fermi-LAT spectrum to the softer TeV spectrum suggests that the detected GeV emission traces the rising tail of the inverse-Compton component extending into the TeV regime. We note that the detection of PSR B1259-63 as early as -400 days before periastron is difficult to reconcile with existing theoretical models.",

Motta accepted for publication by A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) X-ray burst oscillations are quasi-coherent periodic signals at frequencies close to the neutron star spin frequency. They are observed during thermonuclear Type I X-ray bursts from a number of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) hosting a fast-spinning, weakly magnetic neutron star. Besides measuring the spin frequencies, burst oscillations hold the potential to accurately measure neutron star mass and radius, thus providing constraints on the equation of state of matter at nuclear densities. Based on far-ultraviolet (FUV) observations of the X-ray binary EXO 0748-676 taken with the Hubble Space Telescope in 2003, we report a possible indication of ultraviolet burst oscillations at the neutron star spin frequency ($\\sim$552 Hz), potentially the first such case for an LMXB. The candidate signal is observed during an $\\sim$8 s interval in the rising phase of an FUV burst, which occurred $\\sim$4 s after a Type I X-ray burst. Through simulations, we estimated that the probability of detecting the observed signal power from pure random noise is 3.7$\\%$, decreasing to 0.3$\\%$ if only the burst rise interval is considered, during which X-ray burst oscillations had already been observed in this source. The background-subtracted folded pulse profile of the candidate FUV oscillations in the (120-160 nm) band is nearly sinusoidal with a $\\sim$16$\\%$ pulsed fraction, corresponding to a pulsed luminosity of $\\sim$8$\\times$10$^{33}$ erg/s. Interpreting the properties of this candidate FUV burst oscillations in the light of current models for optical-ultraviolet emission from neutron star LMXBs faces severe problems. If signals of this kind are confirmed in future observations, they might point to an unknown coherent emission process as the origin of the FUV burst oscillations observed in EXO 0748-676.",

      "abstract": "Magnetic effects on fundamental modes in rotating neutron stars with a purely toroidal magnetic field Anson Ka Long Yip, Tjonnie Guang Feng Li High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Electromagnetic and gravitational-wave signals from neutron stars are shaped by rapid rotation and strong magnetic fields. Determining these properties is essential to interpret such signals, but current measurements are limited: rotation estimates rely on electromagnetic detections and assume uniform rotation, while inferring interior magnetic fields remains ambiguous due to a lack of direct observations. Measuring the excited fundamental modes of neutron stars in gravitational-wave signals offers a promising solution, as these modes encode information about stellar composition, structure, and dynamics. Previous studies have examined the individual effects of rotation and magnetic fields on these modes, identifying magnetic suppression and establishing linear relations for the frequencies of the fundamental $l=0$ quasi-radial mode $f_F$ and $l=2$ quadrupolar mode $f_{^2f}$. However, few have investigated the combined influence of rotation and magnetic fields. Here, for the first time, we consider both rotation and a toroidal magnetic field to construct linear relations for quantifying $f_F$ and $f_{^2f}$, showing that their combined effects can be constrained by detecting these modes. Using 2D axisymmetric simulations, we demonstrate that quasi-linear relations between $f_F$, $f_{^2f}$, stellar compactness $M/R$, and kinetic-to-binding energy ratio $T/|W|$ persist even with a toroidal magnetic field. The slope of these relations depends on the toroidal magnetization constant $K_\\mathrm{m}$. Additionally, measuring the frequency ratio $f_{^2f}/f_F$ enables inference of $T/|W|$ and the maximum magnetic field strength $\\mathcal{B}_\\mathrm{max}$. Lastly, we show that differential rotation causes only minor deviations from predictions for uniform rotation. Thus, this work demonstrates that rotational and magnetic properties of neutron stars can be inferred from their fundamental modes.",

      "abstract": "Interaction between disk and extended corona in general relativistic framework. I. Static slab corona in global energy balance with the underlying disk Sudeb Ranjan Datta, Michal Bursa, Michal Dovciak, Wenda Zhang High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The energy equilibrium between the corona and the underlying disk in a two-phase accretion flow sets a lower limit on the achievable photon index. A slab corona may not explain the hard state observations of X-ray binaries (XRBs). We incorporate energy feedback to the accretion disk resulting from illumination by an extended corona, and vice versa. The interaction between these two components allows for the possibility of finding an energetically self-consistent equilibrium solution for a given disk-corona system. We have upgraded the existing Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, MONK, to incorporate the interaction between the disk and the extended corona within the general relativistic framework. We introduce an albedo parameter to specify the fraction of the incident flux that is reflected by the disk, while the remainder is absorbed and added to the intrinsic dissipation. Reflection is modeled assuming a semi-infinite electron atmosphere. We find global equilibrium solutions by iterating interaction between disk and extended slab corona. A higher black hole spin, higher coronal temperature, and higher albedo all lead to harder spectra. For typical coronal temperatures and disk albedo, the lowest achievable photon index with a static slab corona fully covering the disk is approximately 1.7-1.8. With the upgraded version of MONK, we are now able to achieve global energy equilibrium for a given disk-corona system. This approach holds significant potential for constraining the coronal geometry using not only the observed flux but also polarization. A static slab does not appear to be a favorable coronal geometry for the hard state of XRBs, even when global energy balance is taken into account. In future work, we will explore truncated disk geometries and outflowing coronae as potential alternatives. (shortened)",

HMXBs are expected to have experienced a supernova in their evolution. The impulsive kick associated with this event should affect the space velocity of the system in a way that depends on the nature and state of the progenitor binary. Here, we test whether the different evolutionary histories of HMXBs have left a detectable imprint on their peculiar velocities ($V_{\\rm pec}$). Using data from Gaia Data Release 3 (Gaia DR3), we first calculate the $V_{\\rm pec}$ values for 63 well-known HMXBs hosting a black hole or neutron star and estimate the associated uncertainties via Monte Carlo re-sampling. We then analyse their distribution and check for differences between classes. Overall, $V_{\\rm pec}$ estimates extend up to 100 km s$^{-1}$, but with Be/X-ray binaries (BeXRBs) favouring $V_{\\rm pec}$ $\\lesssim 40$ km s$^{-1}$ and supergiant X-ray binaries (SgXRBs) favouring $V_{\\rm pec}$ $\\gtrsim 40$ km s$^{-1}$. Based on a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, the null hypothesis that the peculiar velocities of both classes are drawn from the same parent distribution can be robustly rejected, irrespective of the background stellar velocity dispersion. Tests with binary population synthesis demonstrate that SgXRBs typically have shorter orbital periods and higher fractional mass loss than BeXRBs at supernova. We argue that the magnitude of $V_{\\rm pec}$ could be used as a complementary feature to distinguish between Be and supergiant systems. These findings extend previous inferences based on two-dimensional kinematics from Hipparcos, and may be explained by the differing nature of the respective progenitors systems between the source classes at the instant of supernova.",

Heywood High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Jets from accreting black hole (BH) X-ray binaries (XRBs) are powerful outflows that release a large fraction of the accretion energy to the surrounding environment, providing a feedback mechanism that may alter the interstellar medium (ISM) properties. Studying accretion and feedback together enables estimates of matter and energy input/output around accreting BHs. We focus on the extended jet structures of the BH-XRB GRS1758-258. First seen in VLA data, these parsec-scale jets arise from jet-ISM interaction and show a Z-shaped morphology. Using the MeerKAT telescope we observed GRS1758-258 in L-band for a total exposure of 7 hr. Applying a calorimetry-based method developed for AGN and later used for XRBs, we estimated the properties of the jets and of the surrounding ISM. We detect a jet and counter-jet terminating in bow-shocks. Within the northern jet lobe we identify synchrotron and bremsstrahlung emission, while the southern lobe is dominated by thermal emission. We measure ISM densities between 10-40 cm-3 across both jets, slightly lower in the northern region. The estimated ages of the two lobes range from 6-51 kyr. The time-averaged jet power lies between 4.4x10^33 and 3.3x10^36 erg/s, with differences between north and south likely due to different local ISM conditions. Comparing new MeerKAT with archival VLA data, we measured a proper motion of 130 mas/yr in a portion of the northern jet. Jet-ISM interaction structures on both sides of GRS1758-258 reveal different ISM properties. The comparison between these structures and those from other XRBs suggests that the lobes in GRS1758-258 are younger and may result from different jet activity phases. The time-averaged energy transferred to the environment is slightly lower than in other XRBs, consistent with the younger age of the lobes in GRS1758-258 relative to those of other systems.",

To investigate these processes, we analyze the northeastern region of the Cygnus Loop with XMM-Newton. The electron temperature is found to increase towards the interior of the remnant ranging from 0.15-0.19 keV energy range within a spatial scale of 6 arcmin (or 1.27 pc at a distance of 725 pc) from the shock front. This can be explained well by a modified Sedov solution with radiative cooling. We also show that the ionization timescales determined from our spectroscopy are significantly larger than those estimated based on the electron density of the surrounding materials and the shock velocity. This excess can be qualitatively explained by a mixing of inner multiple plasma components with different ionization states due to turbulence.",

Here we demonstrate that the neutrino could be produced in a photohadronic interaction in its radio core. The necessary proton power is of order of the source's photon luminosity, and protons can be accelerated to the required energies in the core, while high-energy gamma rays cannot leave the source because of intense production of electron-positron pairs.

Khabibullin Physical Review D v.112, 063017 (2025) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The W50 nebula around microquasar SS~433, powered by supercritical accretion, features two `extended jets' (tens of pc long and a few pc wide) from which polarized X-ray and very high energy radiation above 100 TeV is detected. Here we present a model of very high energy particle acceleration in these extended jets. In the `minimalist' model (discussed in Churazov, Khabibullin, and Bykov, 2024), a collimated outflow aligned with the rotation axis is propagating through a more isotropic wind produced by the accretion disk. The observed extended X-ray jets with bright knots in this model are associated with the formation of strong recollimation MHD shocks after the collision of the collimated outflow with the isotropic wind termination surface. The spectra of electrons and protons up to PeV energies are simulated with a nonlinear Monte Carlo model of diffusive shock acceleration with turbulent magnetic field amplification. The overall efficiency of the jets power transfer to accelerated protons in this model is above 10\\% and about 0.5\\% for electrons above 50 TeV. The magnetic field amplification by Bell's instability due to the electric current of cosmic rays escaping the accelerator produces highly anisotropic magnetic turbulence in the shock downstream. This results in the polarized synchrotron X-ray emission with the photon electric vector predominantly transverse to the jet direction and the degree of polarization above 20\\%. The model is able to reproduce the observed spectra and intensity profiles of non-thermal X-ray and gamma-ray emission, which are both dominated by the leptonic radiation.",

We study the X-ray properties of low-mass members of the open cluster NGC 2516 to explicate their detailed dependencies on mass and rotation. We analysed the pointed SRG/eROSITA satellite observations of NGC 2516 obtained during the calibration and performance verification phase of the mission. We found 1561 X-ray sources within the field of view and related 1007 of them to their optical stellar counterparts, including 655 members of NGC 2516 (433 with rotation periods). We combined these detections with auxiliary optical data to facilitate their interpretation. Furthermore, we extracted X-ray spectra for all sources and fit two-component APEC models to them. To aid the analysis, we grouped stars with similar mass and rotational properties together, which allowed us to investigate the influence of rotation on various X-ray properties. The colour-activity diagram of NGC 2516 displays a general increase in the fractional X-ray luminosity with spectral type change from F through G and K to M-type. However, the behaviour of K-type stars, representing the ones that best sample the fast-to-slow rotational transition, is more complex, with both increased and decreased X-ray emission relative to G-type stars for fast and slow rotators, respectively. The rotation-activity diagram is analogous, with an identifiable desaturated group of X-ray emitters that corresponds to stars in the rotational gap between the fast and slow rotator sequences. We prefer to describe the normalised X-ray emission for all cluster stars as declining logarithmically with Rossby number over those using broken power laws. Coronal temperatures appear to be largely independent of mass or rotation. (abridged)",

The effect depends on the companion mass, metallicity, the amount of mass it accreted, orbital parameters and other parameters. We simulate individual companion stars assuming they undergo such accretion events. We study the envelope properties of 20 $\\rm M_\\odot$ and 30 $\\rm M_\\odot$ single massive stars at different matallicities ($Z= 0.02$, $Z=0.008$ and $Z=0.004$) during accretion at different rates, from $\\rm 10^{-5}$ to $\\rm 10^{-2}~M_\\odot\\,yr^{-1}$. For the lower accretion rates we simulate, the stars remains hot, while at higher accretion rates, it becomes cooler and inflates. This behavior is observed in both stars but occurs at different accretion rates. Higher metallicity stars exhibit greater variations in accretion luminosity for the same accretion rate and stellar mass compared to lower metallicity stars. While higher metallicity stars typically have larger stellar envelopes, suggesting smaller variations in luminosity at Galactic metallicity compared to the LMC and SMC, our results show the opposite.",

The model is capable of generating differentiable signals with amplitudes spanning multiple orders of magnitude, as well as consistently producing signals corresponding to the same underlying event for different viewing angles.

D 112, 043035 (2025) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Strong magnetic fields make neutron stars potential sources of detectable electromagnetic and gravitational-wave signals. Hence, inferring these magnetic fields is critical to understand the emissions of neutron stars. However, due to the lack of direct observational evidence, the interior magnetic field configuration remains ambiguous. Here, for the first time, we show that the internal magnetic field strength along with the composition of a neutron star can be directly constrained by detecting the gravitational waves from the \\emph{phase-transition-induced collapse} of a magnetized neutron star. By dynamically simulating this collapsing event, we first find that the dominant peaks in the gravitational waveform are the fundamental $l=0$ quasi-radial $F$ mode and the fundamental $l=2$ quadrupolar $^2f$ mode. We next show that the maximum gravitational wave amplitude $|h|_\\mathrm{max}$ increases with the maximum magnetic field strength of the interior toroidal field $\\mathcal{B}_\\mathrm{max}$ until the maximum rest-mass density at bounce $\\rho_\\mathrm{max,b}$ decreases due to the increasing $\\mathcal{B}_\\mathrm{max}$. We then demonstrated that the magnetic suppression of fundamental modes found in our previous work remains valid for the hybrid stars formed after the phase-transition-induced collapses. We finally show that measuring the frequency ratio between the two fundamental modes $f_{^2f}/f_{F}$ allows one to infer $\\mathcal{B}_\\mathrm{max}$ and the baryonic mass fraction of matter in the mixed phase $M_\\mathrm{mp} / M_{0}$ of the resulting hybrid star. Consequently, taking $\\mathcal{B}_\\mathrm{max}$ and $M_\\mathrm{mp} / M_{0}$ as examples, this work has demonstrated that much information inside neutron stars could be extracted similarly through measuring the oscillation modes of the stars.",

Taylor High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We examine the effects of a giant magnetized halo around the Galaxy on the angular distribution of the arriving ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) observed at Earth. We investigate three injection scenarios for UHECRs, and track them through isotropic turbulent magnetic fields of varying strengths in the Galactic halo. We calculate the resultant dipole and quadrupole amplitudes for the arriving UHECRs detected by an observer in the Galactic plane region. We find that, regardless of the injection scenario considered, when the scattering length of the particles is comparable to the size of the halo, the UHECRs skymap resembles a dipole. However, as the scattering length is increased, the dipolar moment always increases, and the quadrupolar moment increases rapidly for two of the three cases considered. Additionally, the quadrupole amplitude is highlighted to be a key discriminator in discerning the origin of the observed dipole. We conclude that, to understand the origin of the UHECR dipole, one has to measure the strength of the quadrupole amplitude as well.",

We consider the disk is primarily threaded by the toroidal component of the magnetic field and an effective potential satisfactorily mimicked the spacetime geometry around the rotating black hole. With this, we self-consistently solve the coupled governing equations for inflow and outflow and compute the mass outflow rate $R_{\\dot m}$ (ratio of mass flux of inflow to outflow) in terms of the inflow parameters, namely energy ($\\mathcal{E}$), angular momentum ($\\lambda$), plasma-$\\beta$ and conduction parameter ($\\Upsilon_{\\rm s}$) around weakly rotating ($a_{\\rm k} \\rightarrow 0$) as well as rapidly rotating ($a_{\\rm k} =0.99$) black holes. Our findings reveal that the present formalism admits coupled inflow-outflow solutions across a wide range of inflow parameters yielding substantial mass loss. We observe that $R_{\\dot m}$ monotonically increases with $\\Upsilon_{\\rm s}$, irrespective of black hole spin. We also find that for a fixed $\\Upsilon_{\\rm s}$, when energy, angular momentum, and magnetic field strength of the inflowing matter is increased, $R_{\\dot{\\rm m}}$ is enhanced resulting the outflows even more pronounced. We further estimate the maximum outflow rate ($R^{\\rm max}_{\\dot{\\rm m}}$) by varying the inflow parameters and find that thermal conduction leads to maximum mass outflow rate $R^{\\rm max}_{\\dot{\\rm m}} \\sim 25\\%$ for rapidly rotating black hole of spin $a_{\\rm k} = 0.99$. Finally, we employ our formalism to explain the kinetic jet power of $68$ radio-loud low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs), indicating that it is potentially promising to account for the observed jet power of substantial number of LLAGNs.",

IPTA datasets should be the most sensitive datasets to nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs), but take years to assemble, often excluding valuable recent data. To address this, we introduce the IPTA \"Lite\" analysis, where a Figure of Merit is used to select an optimal PTA dataset to analyze for each pulsar, enabling immediate access to new data and preliminary results prior to full combination. We test the capabilities of the Lite analysis using IPTA DR2, finding that \"DR2 Lite\" can be used to detect the common red noise process with an amplitude of $A = 4.8^{+1.8}_{-1.8} \\times 10^{-15}$ at $\\gamma = 13/3$. This amplitude is slightly large in comparison to the combined analysis, and likely biased high as DR2 Lite is more sensitive to systematic errors from individual pulsars than the full dataset. Furthermore, although there is no strong evidence for Hellings-Downs correlations in IPTA DR2, we still find the full dataset is better at resolving Hellings-Downs correlations than DR2 Lite. Alongside the Lite analysis, we also find that analyzing a subset of pulsars from IPTA DR2, available at a hypothetical \"early\" stage of combination (EDR2), yields equally competitive results as the full dataset. Looking ahead, the Lite method will enable rapid synthesis of the latest PTA data, offering preliminary GW constraints before the superior full dataset combinations are available.",

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) A stellar mass black hole (BH) is believed to be formed as the result of the core collapse of a massive star at the end of its evolution. For a class of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), it is widely believed that their centre engines are just these stellar-mass BHs, which accrete the collapsing matter in hyper-accretion mode. In such systems, a popular scenario is that the magnetic field supported in the accretion disk extracts the rotational energy of the spinning BH and launches a jet on one hand, and the accretion of the infalling matter of the collapse will increase the BH's rotational energy on the other hand. Here we report that when the accretion process is dominated by a Magnetically-Arrested-Disk (MAD), the above-mentioned two competing processes link to each other, so that the spin evolution of the BH can be written in a simple form. Most interestingly, when the total accreted mass is enough, the BH spin will always reach an equilibrium value. This value does not depend on the initial mass and spin of the BH, as well as the history of accretion but is a function of the accretion physics near the event horizon. This model predicts that there is a population of stellar-mass BH that possess a universal spin at the end of the collapsing accretion. We test this prediction against the 4th gravitational wave (GW) catalogue (GWTC-4.0) and found that there is a dominating population with high significance, in which the distribution of the spin of the secondary BH is centred narrowly around a single value ~0.017. The above-mentioned scenario is supported and the parameters of the accretion physics near the event horizon can be thus constrained. The result is also consistent with previous numerical simulations.",

The X-ray polarization of Cyg X-1 was measured 13 times with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), covering both hard and soft spectral states. The X-ray polarization degree (PD) in the hard state was found to be $\\approx4.0\\%$, roughly twice as high as in the soft state, where it was around $2.2\\%$. In both states, a statistically significant increase of PD with the energy was found. Moreover, a linear relation between PD and spectral hardness suggests a gradual and continuous evolution of the polarization properties, rather than an abrupt change of polarization production mechanism between states. The polarization angle (PA) was independent of the spectral state and showed no trend with the photon energy. The X-ray PA is well aligned with the orientation of the radio jet, as well as the optical and radio PAs. We find significant orbital changes of PA in the hard state, which we attribute to scattering of X-ray emission at intrabinary structure. No significant superorbital variability in PD or PA was found at the period $P_{\\rm{so}}$ = 294 d. We also find no correlation between the X-ray and optical polarization; if any, there is a long-term anti-correlation between the X-ray PD and the radio PD.",

Comments are welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Magnetar phenomena are likely intertwined with the location and structure of magnetospheric currents. General-relativistic effects are important in shaping the force-free equilibria describing static configurations, though most studies have quantified their impact only in cases of axial symmetry. Using a novel methodology based on physics-informed neural networks, fully three-dimensional configurations of varying stellar compactness are constructed. Realistic profiles for surface currents, qualitatively capturing the geometry of observed hotspots, are applied as boundary conditions to deduce the amount of free energy available to fuel outburst activity. It is found that the lowest-energy solution branches permit only a $\\approx 30\\%$ excess relative to current-starved solutions in axisymmetric cases with global twists, regardless of compactness, reducing to $\\approx 5\\%$ in 3D models with localised spots. Accounting for redshift reductions to their inferred dipole moments from timing data, explaining magnetar burst energetics therefore becomes more difficult unless the field hosts non-negligible multipoles. Discussions on other aspects of magnetar phenomena are also provided.",

The rare properties are the SN Ia ejecta interacting with a carbon-oxygen (CO)-rich circumstellar material (CSM) at approximately 50 days post-explosion. In this DD-MED scenario, two massive CO white dwarfs (WDs), masses of M1=1.1Mo and M2=1Mo, merge to leave a rapidly rotating lonely WD of about the Chandrasekhar mass. The merger process ejects ~0.7Mo to form a nonspherical CO-rich CSM. At the explosion, there is a lonely WD and a detached hydrogen- and helium-deficient CSM. Studies proposed the other lonely WD scenario, the core-degenerate (CD) scenario, to explain several specific SNe Ia and SN Ia remnants. SN 2020aeuh is the first particular SN Ia that is attributed to the DD-MED scenario. Besides being slightly brighter than typical SNe Ia and the CSM interaction, SN 2020aeuh is a normal SN Ia. Therefore, this study strengthens the claim of earlier studies, which are based on other arguments, like the properties of SN Ia remnants, that the lonely WD scenarios, i.e., the DD-MED and CD scenarios, might account for most, if not all, normal SNe Ia. These earlier studies also argue that all SN Ia scenarios, whether lonely WD or not, might contribute to peculiar SNe Ia.",

In order to identify their sources, we need precise knowledge of the mass composition of UHECRs. The direct detection of UHECRs is not feasible at energies above 0.1 PeV, necessitating the use of mass-sensitive observables of extended air showers induced by UHECRs interacting with the atmosphere. One way to achieve high statistics for these mass-sensitive observables is to use ground-based detector arrays, such as the Surface Detector (SD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The SD consists of three sub-arrays of independent detector stations arranged in triangular grids with different spacings. Recently, it has been shown that neural networks (NNs) can extract mass-sensitive observables from data taken by the SD-1500, the largest sub-detector of the SD. In this contribution, we demonstrate the feasibility of using NNs to reconstruct a high-level shower observable, the depth of the shower maximum, from data simulated for and observed by the SD-750, the second-largest detector array nested within the SD-1500. A simulation study shows that the SD-750 NN exhibits behavior similar to that of an SD-1500 NN and outperforms the latter in the energy range [1, 10) EeV. Moreover, we show that, after performing a correction and calibration procedure, the predictions of the SD-750 NN are consistent with the measurement of the depth of the shower maximum obtained by the Fluorescence Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory.",

We exploit the ASTRODEEP-JWST photometric catalogs to single out robust candidates, including sources quenched only a few tens of Myr before the observation. We apply a SED-fitting procedure which explores three functional forms of star formation history and the $\\chi^2$ probabilities of the solutions, with additional checks to minimise the contamination from interlopers, tuning our selection criteria against available spectroscopic data from the DAWN archive and simulated catalogs. We select 633 candidates, which we rank by a reliability parameter based on the probabilities of the quiescent and alternative star-forming solutions, with 291 candidates tagged as \"gold\". According to the best-fit models, 79\\% of the massive ($\\log(M_\\ast/M_\\odot) \\geq 10.5$) quiescent galaxies at $3 < z < 5$ stopped forming stars at least 150 Myr before the time of observation, while 89\\% of low-mass sources have been quenched for less than 150 Myr. The abundance of low-mass old quiescent systems does not increase significantly with time from $z = 5$ to 3: low-mass objects seem to be experiencing a short episode of quenching followed by rejuvenation (``breathing''), consistent with a downsizing scenario of galaxy formation. We also find an abrupt drop in the density of massive quiescent candidates at $z > 5$. We derive estimates for the number density of early passive galaxies up to $z = 10$ and compare them against various models: tensions with data remain in the modeling of the observed bimodality of time passed since quenching as a function of mass.",

Comerford 21 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables. Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The remnants of galaxy mergers may host multiple off-nuclear massive black holes (MBHs), some of which may wander indefinitely within the host galaxy halos. Tracing the population of offset MBHs is essential for understanding how the distribution of MBHs in the Universe evolves through galaxy mergers, the efficiency of binary MBH formation, and the rates at which MBHs are seeded in low-mass satellite galaxies. Offset MBHs can be observationally traced if they are accreting and detectable as spatially offset active galactic nuclei (AGN). In this work, we build the largest uniform sample of spatially offset AGN candidates (328) by matching sources from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) to galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Based on the radio source surface density, 29+/-3% are unrelated chance projections. The offset AGN occupation fraction is positively correlated with host galaxy stellar mass, consistent with predictions that most offset MBHs will reside in massive halos. However, this trend vanishes, and may reverse, at the lowest stellar masses, potentially reflecting the weaker host galaxy gravitational potentials. The offset AGN occupation fraction shows no significant evolution with orbital radius, and the agreement with predictions suggests a binary MBH formation rate of <0.5 per merger. Finally, for offset MBHs down to masses of 10^5 Solar masses, the occupation fraction is ~30-70 times lower than the expected value assuming all accreted satellites host a MBH. This result may suggest a relatively low MBH seeding efficiency.",

      "abstract": "An Improved Fit to the Density Distribution in Supersonic Isothermal Turbulence Evan Scannapieco, Marcus Brüggen, Philipp Grete, Liubin Pan 20 pages, 7 figures, Comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The density distribution of supersonic isothermal turbulence plays a critical role in many astrophysical systems. It is commonly approximated by a lognormal distribution with a variance of $\\sigma_{s,V}^2 \\approx \\ln(1 + b^2 M_{\\rm V}^2),$ where $s \\equiv \\ln \\rho/\\rho_0,$ $M_{\\rm V}$ is the rms volume-weighted Mach number, and $b$ is a parameter that depends on the driving mechanism, which can be solenoidal (divergence-free), compressive (curl-free), or a mix of the two. However, this neglects the correlation time of driving ($\\tau_{\\rm a}$), which plays a key role whenever compressive driving is significant. Here we conduct turbulence simulations spanning a wide range of Mach numbers, $1\\lesssim M_{\\rm V}\\lesssim 10$, driving mechanisms, and $\\tau_{\\rm a}$ values. In the compressive case, we find that $\\sigma_{s,V}^2$ scales approximately linearly with $M_{\\rm V},$ and its dependence on $\\tau_{\\rm a}$ is $\\sigma_{s,V}^2 \\approx M_{\\rm V} [1 + \\frac{2}{3}(\\lambda_{\\rm a} + 1)\\Theta(\\lambda_{\\rm a} + 1)]$, where $\\lambda_{\\rm a} \\equiv \\ln(\\tau_{\\rm a}/\\tau_{\\rm e})$, $\\tau_{\\rm e}$ is the eddy turnover time, and $\\Theta$ is the Heaviside step function. Mixed-driven turbulence shows a weaker dependence on $\\tau_{\\rm a},$ and for solenoidally-driven turbulence, $\\sigma_{s,V}^2 \\approx \\frac{1}{3}M_{\\rm V}$, independent of $\\tau_{\\rm a}$ and consistent with the standard expression when $M_V \\lesssim 10.$ The volume-weighted mean and skewness also show systematic trends with $M_{\\rm V}$ and $\\tau_{\\rm a}$, deviating from lognormal expectations. For the mass-weighted density distribution, we observe significant broadening and skewness in compressively driven cases, especially at large $\\tau_{\\rm a}/\\tau_{\\rm e}$. These results provide a refined framework for modeling astrophysical turbulence.",

Font, Dharmesh Mistry, Sandra Ortega-Martorell, Ivan Olier Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Clustering algorithms can help reconstruct the assembly history of the Milky Way by identifying groups of stars sharing similar properties in a kinematical or chemical abundance space. However, although being promising tools, their efficiency has not yet been fully tested in a realistic cosmological framework. We investigate the effectiveness of the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm in the recovery of the progenitors of Milky Way-type galaxies, using several systems from the Auriga suite of simulations. We develop a methodology aimed at improving the efficiency of the algorithm and avoiding fragmentation: First, we use a 12-dimensional feature space including a range of chemodynamical properties and stellar ages; furthermore, we optimise the algorithm using information from the internal structure of the clusters of accreted stars. We show that our approach yields good results in terms of both purity and completeness of clusters for galaxies with different types of accretion histories. We also evaluate the decrease in efficiency due to contamination by in situ stars. While for accreted-only haloes the algorithm matches well the recovered clusters with the individual progenitors and is able to recover accretion events up to a redshift of accretion $z_{\\rm acc}\\sim3$, for accreted + in situ haloes it can only identify the more recent accretion events ($z_{\\rm acc} < 1$). However, the purity of the identified clusters remains remarkably high even in this case. Our results suggest that HDBSCAN can efficiently identify accreted debris in Milky Way-type galaxies in realistic conditions, however, it requires careful optimization to provide valid results.",

The high-resolution integral field spectroscopic data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) reveal a well-ordered rotation pattern, consisting of a rapidly rotating nuclear disc that is somewhat decoupled from the main disc, together with an inner lens; we collectively refer to these structures as the \"disc-lens\". The central peak in the velocity dispersion indicates the presence of a classical bulge. The nuclear disc is dynamically colder than the surrounding disc, while the lens is dynamically hotter. The higher-order Gauss-Hermite moments, $h_{3}$ and $h_{4}$, further characterise the stellar kinematics. An anti-correlation between the line-of-sight velocity and skewness ($h_{3}$) is consistent with regular rotation. In contrast, the ring-like enhancement in kurtosis ($h_{4}$) confirms the presence of the nuclear disc component. Unsharp masking of HST images (Erwin et al. 2015) reveals a nuclear bar and faint spiral structures within the central 10 arcsec, supporting the role of secular evolution. The mass-weighted stellar age map shows an old stellar population in the central regions, with high metallicity that suggests the in-situ formation of the disc-lens from disc material. We discuss possible formation scenarios for the disc-lens, including both minor mergers and secular processes, and examine the influence of the Dorado group environment on NGC 1553. Our findings suggest that the disc-lens in NGC 1553 formed during the early stages of the galaxy's evolution. However, its subsequent development has been shaped by internal and external processes. These results provide new insights into the origin and evolution of kinematically distinct substructures in S0 galaxies.",

We present deep Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band~6 continuum and CO(3--2) observations of 17 QGs at $z\\sim0.4$ in the COSMOS field. Using the dust-to-molecular gas mass ratio ($\\delta_{\\rm DGR}$) as a key diagnostic, we trace post-quenching evolution of the cold interstellar medium. Our study triples the number of QGs with direct $\\delta_{\\rm DGR}$ estimates, constraining 12 systems with stellar population ages of $\\sim$5--10 Gyr. For the first time, we show that $\\delta_{\\rm DGR}$ in QGs ranges from $\\sim8\\times$ below to $\\sim2.5\\times$ above the canonical value of $\\delta_{\\rm DGR}\\sim1/100$. Despite uniformly low molecular gas fractions (median $f_{\\rm H_2}=M_{\\rm H_2}/M_{\\star}\\sim4.1\\%$), QGs follow diverse evolutionary paths: about half exhibit rapid ($\\sim700$ Myr) exponential dust decline with age, while the rest show mild decline over $\\gtrsim$2 Gyr, maintaining elevated $\\delta_{\\rm DGR}\\gtrsim1/100$. Our results support simulations predictions of dust and molecular gas evolving independently post-quenching, without a preferred quenching mode. This challenges the use of dust continuum as a $\\rm H_2$ tracer, implying that quenching cannot be robustly linked to interstellar medium conditions when relying solely on dust or gas.",

Thuruthipilly Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) While the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) now allows identifying quiescent galaxies (QGs) out to early epochs, the photometric selection of quiescent galaxy candidates (QGCs) and the derivation of key physical quantities are highly sensitive to the assumed star-formation histories (SFHs). We aim to quantify how the inclusion of JWST/MIRI data and different SFH models impacts the selection and characterisation of QGCs. We test the robustness of the physical properties inferred from the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, such as M*, age, star formation rate (SFR), and AV, and study how they impact the quiescence criteria of the galaxies across cosmic time. We perform SED fitting for ~13000 galaxies at z<6 from the CEERS/MIRI fields with up to 20 optical-mid infrared (MIR) broadband coverage. We implement three SFH prescriptions: flexible delayed, NonParametric, and extended Regulator. For each model, we compare results obtained with and without MIRI photometry and dust emission models. We evaluate the impact of these configurations on the number of candidate QGCs, selected based on rest UVJ colours, sSFR and main-sequence offset, and on their key physical properties such as M*, AV, and stellar ages. The number of QGCs selected varies significantly with the choice of SFH from 171 to 224 out of 13000 galaxies, depending on the model. This number increases to 222-327 when MIRI data are used (up to ~45% more QGCs). This enhancement is driven by improved constraints on dust attenuation and M*. We find a strong correlation between AV and M*, with massive galaxies (M*~10^11 M\\odot) being 1.5-4.2 times more attenuated in magnitude than low-mass systems (M*~10^9 M\\odot), depending on SFH. Regardless of the SFH assumption, ~13% of QGCs exhibit significant attenuation (AV > 0.5) in support of recent JWST studies challenging the notion that quiescent galaxies are uniformly dust-free.",

Saracino Accepted for publication in A&A, 22 pages, 13 figures, 4 tables Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) In this study, we report conclusive evidence for an ancient star cluster that has been accreted by the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). By leveraging observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we investigate the chrono-dynamical structure of a sample of seven old star clusters within the LMC in a self-consistent way. The multi-epoch nature of the dataset allowed the determination of high-precision proper motions for the clusters. Employing an isochrone-fitting methodology, we additionally infer from the deep high-resolution HST data homogeneous and robust estimates for their distances, ages and metallicities. Supplementing these data with literature line-of-sight velocities, we investigate the full 3-dimensional dynamics of the clusters within the frame of the LMC. With respect to the other clusters in our sample, NGC 1841 depicts a peculiar case. Its position in the age-metallicity plane, that makes it about 1 Gyr younger than the other metal-poor LMC clusters, but also its dynamical properties with a radial orbit almost perpendicular to the LMC disc plane, clearly advocates for a different origin. We thus conclude that NGC 1841 has likely been accreted by the LMC from a smaller galaxy. The other clusters in our sample show disc-like kinematics, with the case of NGC 2210 being peculiar, based on its inclined orbit. Their coherent age-metallicity relation closely resembles that of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus globular clusters, thus suggesting a similar early evolution for the two dwarf galaxies. We do not find clear-cut chrono-kinematic evidence that NGC 2005 has been accreted by the LMC as suggested by a previous study based on its chemical abundance pattern. Regardless of its nature, its very old age illustrates that peculiar chemical evolutions already emerge at very early times.",

Jakob Walcher 21 pages, 17 figures; Submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Distance measurements using the planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF) rely on the bright-end power-law cut-off magnitude ($M^*$), which is defined by a number of the [OIII]$\\lambda5007$-brightest planetary nebulae (PNe). In early-type galaxies (ETGs), the formation of these PNe is enigmatic; the population is typically too old to form the expected $M^*$ PNe from single star evolution. We aim to give a solution to this problem. We selected five ETGs with known MUSE-PNLF distances. The MUSE instrument allows us to calculate the PNLF and consistently investigate the underlying stellar populations. Using stellar population synthesis, we derive the population age, star formation history, metallicity, and alpha abundance. We compare these parameters to the PNLF variables: $M^*$ and luminosity-specific PN number at the top 0.5 mag of the PNLF ($\\alpha_{0.5}$). We also compare our results with PNe In Cosmological Simulations (PICS) model applied to Magneticum Pathfinder analogue galaxies. The average mass-weighted ages and metallicities of our observations are typically old ($9 <\\mathrm{Age}< 13.5$ Gyr) and rather metal-rich ($-0.4 <\\mathrm{[M/H]}< +0.2$). We find $M^*$ to be independent of age and metallicity in these ages and metallicity intervals. We discover a positive correlation between $\\alpha_{0.5}$ values and the mass fraction of stellar population ages of 2--10 Gyr, implying that most of the PNe originate from stars with intermediate ages. Similar trends are also found in the PICS analogue galaxies. We show that the presence of at least $\\sim 2\\%$ of stellar mass younger than 10 Gyr is, in principle, sufficient to form the $M^*$ PNe in ETGs. We also present observing requirements for an ideal PNLF distance determination in ETGs.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The main accretion phase of protostars is characterized by the ejection of material in the form of jets/outflows. External UV irradiation can potentially have a significant impact on the excitation conditions within these outflows. High-resolution observations in the mid-infrared allow us to investigate the details of those energetic processes through the emission of shock-excited H$_2$ . Our aim is to spatially resolve H$_2$ and ionic/atomic emission within the outflows of low-mass protostars, and investigate its origin in connection to shocks influenced by external ultraviolet irradiation. We analyze spectral maps of 5 Class I protostars in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/MRS). Four out of five protostars show strong H$_2$, [\\ion{Ne}{II}], and [\\ion{Fe}{II}] emission associated with outflows/jets. Pure rotational H$_2$ transitions from S(1) to S(8) are found and show two distinct temperature components on Boltzmann diagrams with rotational temperatures of $\\sim$500-600 K and $\\sim$1000-3000 K respectively. Both $C$-type shocks propagating at high pre-shock densities (n$_\\text{H} \\ge$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$) and $J$-type shocks at low pre-shock densities (n$_\\text{H} \\le$10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$) reproduce the observed line ratios. However, only $C$-type shocks produce sufficiently high column densities of H$_2$, whereas predictions from a single $J$-type shock reproduce the observed rotational temperatures of the gas better. A combination of various types of shocks could play a role in protostellar outflows as long as UV irradiation is included in the models. The origin of this radiation is likely internal, since no significant differences in the excitation conditions of outflows are seen at various locations in the cloud.",

Hewett, Carolin Villforth 21 pages, 14 figures, 2 tables in the main text. Accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Galaxy evolution theories require co-evolution between accreting supermassive black holes (SMBH) and galaxies to explain many properties of the local galaxy population, yet observational evidence for the mechanisms driving this co-evolution is lacking. The recent star-formation histories of the host galaxies of accreting SMBHs (Active Galactic Nuclei, AGNs) can help constrain the processes that feed SMBHs and halt star formation in galaxies, but are difficult to obtain for the most luminous AGNs (quasars). We introduce Mean-Field Independent Component Analysis (MFICA) to decompose quasar spectra and obtain recent star formation histories of their host galaxies. Applying MFICA to quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 Quasar Catalogue in the redshift range $0.16 \\leq z \\leq 0.76$, we find that 53 per cent of quasar host galaxies are star-forming, 17 per cent lie in the green-valley, while only 5 per cent are quiescent. This contrasts with 14, 11, and 74 per cent of a mass-matched control sample that are star-forming, green-valley, and quiescent, respectively. We find that $\\sim25$ per cent of quasars are hosted by post-starburst galaxies, an excess of $28\\pm1$ compared to our control sample. While the heterogeneity of recent star formation histories implies multiple SMBH feeding mechanisms, the excess of post-starburst host galaxies demonstrates the link between accreting SMBHs and a recent starburst followed by rapid quenching. Given that massive post-starburst galaxies are predominantly caused by gas-rich major mergers, our results indicate that $30-50$ per cent of quasars originate from merger-induced starbursts.",

Garrod, Albert Rimola 111 pages, 27 figures, Invited review article for The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review, Accepted for publication Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) There is a long-standing discussion in the astrophysical/astrochemical community as to the structure and morphology of dust grains in various astrophysical environments (e.g., interstellar clouds, protostellar envelopes, protoplanetary and debris disks, and the atmospheres of exoplanets). Typical grain models assume a compact dust core which becomes covered in a thick ice mantle in cold dense environments. In contrast, less compact cores are likely to exhibit porosity, leading to a pronounced increase in surface area with concomitant much thinner ice films and higher accessibility to the bare grain surface. Several laboratory experimental and theoretical studies have shown that this type of dust structure can have a marked effect on several physico-chemical processes, including adsorption, desorption, mobility, and reactivity of chemical species. Porous grains are thus thought to likely play a particularly important and wide-ranging astrochemical role. Herein, we clarify what is meant by porosity in relation to grains and grain agglomerates, assess the likely astrochemical effects of porosity and ask whether a fractal/porous structural/morphological description of dust grains is appropriate from an astronomical perspective. We provide evidence for high porosity from laboratory experiments and computational simulations of grains and their growth in various astrophysical environments. Finally, we assess the observational constraints and perspectives on cosmic dust porosity. Overall, our paper discusses the effects of including porosity in dust models and the need to use such models for future astrophysical, astrochemical and astrobiological studies involving surface or solid-state processes.",

Under review at A&A; revised after first referee comments Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a first large-scale kinematic map of $\\sim$50,000 young OB stars ($T_{\\rm eff} \\geq 10,000$ K), based on BOSS spectroscopy from the Milky Way Mapper OB program in the ongoing Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V). Using photogeometric distances, line-of-sight velocities and Gaia DR3 proper motions, we map 3D Galactocentric velocities across the Galactic plane to $\\sim$5 kpc from the Sun, with a focus on radial motions ($v_R$). Our results reveal mean radial motion with amplitudes of $\\pm 30$ km/s that are coherent on kiloparsec scales, alternating between inward and outward motions. These $\\bar{v}_R$ amplitudes are considerably higher than those observed for older, red giant populations. These kinematic patterns show only a weak correlation with spiral arm over-densities. Age estimates, derived from MIST isochrones, indicate that 85% of the sample is younger than $\\sim300$ Myr and that the youngest stars ($\\le 30$ Myr) align well with density enhancements. The age-dependent $\\bar{v}_R$ in Auriga makes it plausible that younger stars exhibits different velocity variations than older giants. The origin of the radial velocity features remains uncertain, and may result from a combination of factors, including spiral arm dynamics, the Galactic bar, resonant interactions, or phase mixing following a perturbation. The present analysis is based on approximately one-third of the full target sample. The completed survey will enable a more comprehensive investigation of these features and a detailed dynamical interpretation.",

Seleznev Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We performed counts of stars with poor astrometric solutions of Gaia DR3 in the regions of open star clusters: NGC 188, NGC 1039, NGC 2287, NGC 2301, NGC 2360, NGC 2420, NGC 2527, NGC 2548, NGC 2682 (M 67), NGC 3114, NGC 3766, NGC 5460, NGC 6649. The selection of the possible cluster members is based on the Gaia photometry using the Hess diagram. We look for stars that fall within the region of the Hess diagram plotted from probable cluster members based on Hunt & Reffert data. We take stars with two-parameter solutions, with the parameter RUWE>1.4, as well as with large relative parallax errors that fall within the Hess diagram region for probable cluster members. The radii of clusters based on stars with poor astrometric solutions and the number of such possible cluster members were estimated. The number of stars with poor astrometric solutions relative to the number of stars from the Hunt & Reffert sample N_bad/N varies very widely with a median average of approximately 30%. This means that when one selects probable cluster members based on precise astrometric data from Gaia DR3, an average of about 23% of cluster members may be lost. Among the lost stars there may be a significant number of unresolved binary and multiple systems. We investigated the dependence of the relative number of stars with poor astrometric solutions on the galactic latitude and on the average number density of stars. The brightness functions with and without stars with poor solutions differ significantly in the region of faint stars 14<G<18 mag for clusters with a relative number of possible cluster members with poor astrometric solutions of N_bad/N>=0.15.",

Moscardini Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Star clusters are valuable indicators of galaxy evolution, offering insights into the buildup of stellar populations across cosmic time. Understanding intrinsic star cluster populations of dwarf galaxies is particularly important given their role in the hierarchical growth of larger systems. Using Euclid Early Release Observation data, we study star clusters in two star-forming dwarf irregulars in the Local Group, NGC 6822 and IC 10 [$M_\\star \\sim$ (1--4) $\\times10^8 M_\\odot$]. With Euclid, clusters are resolved into individual stars across the main bodies and haloes of both galaxies. Visual inspection of $I_E$ images uncovers 30 new cluster candidates in NGC 6822 and 16 in IC 10, from compact to extended clusters. We re-evaluate literature candidates, producing combined catalogues of 52 (NGC 6822) and 71 (IC 10) clusters with confidence-based classifications. We present homogeneous photometry in $I_E$, $Y_E$, $J_E$, $H_E$, and archival UBVRI data, alongside size measurements and properties from BAGPIPES SED fitting. Synthetic cluster injection shows our sample is $\\sim 50$% complete to $M \\lesssim 10^3 M_\\odot$ for ages $\\lesssim 100$ Myr, and to $M \\lesssim 3\\times10^4 M_\\odot$ for $\\sim 10$ Gyr. IC 10 has more young clusters than NGC 6822, extending to higher masses, consistent with its starburst nature. Both dwarfs host several old massive ($\\gtrsim 10^5 M_\\odot$) clusters, including an exceptional $1.3 \\times 10^6 M_\\odot$ cluster in NGC 6822's outskirts. In NGC 6822, we identify a previously undetected, old, extended cluster ($R_h = 12.4 \\pm 0.11$ pc). Using well-defined criteria, we identify 11 candidate GCs in NGC 6822 and eight in IC 10. Both galaxies have high specific frequencies ($S_N$) but remain consistent with known GC scaling relations at low luminosity.",

The magnitude of this scatter as a function of galaxy mass and redshift contains valuable information about the origin of SMBHs and the physical nature of their co-evolution with galaxies. In this work, we highlight this connection by studying the scatter in the $M_{\\rm BH}$-$M_\\star$ relation for massive galaxies in the Illustris, TNG100, and EAGLE cosmological simulations. We find that TNG100 shows significantly lower scatter than Illustris and EAGLE, reflecting different BH feedback models. Using numerical experiments, we separate different contributions to the scatter, including an intrinsic component. At $z=0$, Illustris and EAGLE show $\\sim 0.3$ dex intrinsic scatter dominated by BH accretion, while the smaller scatter in TNG100 is dominated by hierarchical merging, implying more tightly quenched massive galaxies. BH seed mass variations can add scatter, though their impact at $z=0$ depends on the feedback model. Without AGN feedback the scatter is much larger for low-mass galaxies ($\\gtrsim 0.5$ dex for $\\log M_\\star < 10^{10.5},\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ at $z=0-3$), underscoring the crucial role of feedback in SMBH-galaxy co-evolution. In contrast, hierarchical merging of quenched systems is the main factor reducing scatter for massive galaxies. Based on our results, we expect that the scatter in the $M_{\\rm BH}$-$M_\\star$ relation at high redshift could be particularly powerful in providing clues to the origin of SMBHs.",

Submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present the first results from MARTA (Measuring Abundances at high Redshift with the T$_e$ Approach), a programme leveraging ultra-deep, medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy to probe the interstellar medium (ISM) of star-forming galaxies at $z \\sim 2 - 3$. We report detections of one or more auroral lines, including [O III]$\\lambda4363$, [O II]$\\lambda\\lambda7320,7330$, [S II] $\\lambda4068$, and [S III] $\\lambda6312$ for 16 galaxies in the sample, providing measurements of multiple ionic temperatures. We tested the validity of the T[O II]-T[O III] relation at high redshift considering a total sample of 21 objects including literature data, and obtained a shallower slope than in the low-$z$ literature. However, such a slope is consistent with low-redshift data when ultra-low metallicity objects are considered. We assessed the correlation of the T[O II]-T[O III] relationship and its scatter on different physical parameters, finding a mild correlation with the ionisation parameter and radiation field hardness, while no significant correlation with gas density. The location of high-redshift data is also consistent with the low-$z$ literature in the T[O II]-T[S II], and T[S III]-T[O III] relations, although this conclusion is limited with low-number statistics. Finally, we leveraged our sample together with a comprehensive compilation of galaxies with [O III]$\\lambda4363$ detections from the literature to recalibrate classical strong-line diagnostics at high redshift. MARTA represents a key addition in this space because it provides direct metallicities at moderately high oxygen abundances (12+log(O/H) $\\sim8.0-8.4$).",

Talbot, Freeke van de Voort, Maria Werhahn 14 pages, 12 figures, accepted by MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Numerical simulations have become an indispensable tool in astrophysics. To interpret their results, it is critical to understand their intrinsic variability, that is, how much the results change with numerical noise or inherent stochasticity of the physics model. We present a set of seven realisations of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy with the Auriga galaxy formation model. All realisations share the same initial conditions and code parameters, but draw different random numbers for the inherently stochastic parts of the model. We show that global galaxy properties at $z=0$, including stellar mass, star formation history, masses of stellar bulge and stellar disc, the radius and height of the stellar disk change by less than $10\\%$ between the different realisations, and that magnetic field structures in the disc and the halo are very similar. In contrast, the star formation rate today can vary by a factor of two and the internal morphological structure of the stellar disc can change. The time and orbit of satellite galaxies and their galaxy properties when falling into the main halo are again very similar, but their orbits start to deviate after first pericenter passage. Finally, we show that changing the mass resolution of all matter components by a factor of $8$ in the Auriga model changes galaxy properties significantly more than the intrinsic variability of the model, and that these changes are systematic. This limits detailed comparisons between simulations at different numerical resolutions.",

Based on Local Universe observations, quiescent galaxies (QGs) host lower to no HI compared to star-forming galaxies (SFGs), but no constraints have been derived so far at higher redshift (z>0.1). Understanding whether QGs can retain significant HI reservoirs at higher z is crucial to refine quenching and gas accretion models and to constrain overall star formation efficiency at different epochs. Aims. We aim to probe HI in candidate QGs at intermediate redshifts (z=0.36) and to understand whether there exists a class of QGs retaining consistent HI reservoirs and which parameters (dust content, stellar mass, Dn4000, morphology, environment) effectively capture HI-rich QGs. Methods. We perform 21-cm spectral line stacking on MIGHTEE-HI data at z=0.36, targeting two different samples of QGs, defined by means of a color-selection criterion and a spectroscopic criterion based on Dn4000, respectively. We also perform stacking on subsamples of the spectroscopically-selected quiescent sample to investigate the correlation between the HI content and other galaxy properties. Results. We find that QGs with an IR counterpart (i.e., dusty galaxies) are found to host a substantial HI content, on average just 40% lower than SFGs. In contrast, color-selected QGs still hold HI, but lower than SFGs by a factor 3. Among dusty objects, we find morphology to have a mild impact on the atomic gas content, with spirals hosting approximately 15-30% more HI than spheroids. Environmental effects are also present, with low-density regions hosting galaxies that are HI-richer than in high-density ones, by approximately 30% for spirals and 60% for spheroids. We suggest that, in general, HI content is driven by several factors, including quenching mechanisms and ISM enrichment processes. Also, quiescent galaxies - and especially dusty systems - seem to yield HI more consistently than in the Local Universe.",

Traditional methods, such as spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, can be computationally expensive and may struggle to capture complex galaxy properties. This study aims to develop a robust and efficient machine learning (ML) classification method to identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies within the Farmer COSMOS2020 catalog. We utilized JWST wide-field light cones from the Santa Cruz semi-analytical modeling framework to train a supervised ML model, the CatBoostClassifier, using 28 color features derived from 8 mutual photometric bands within the COSMOS catalog. The model was validated against a testing set and compared to the SED-fitting method in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and execution time. Preprocessing steps included addressing missing data, injecting observational noise, and applying a magnitude cut (ch1 < 26 AB) along with a redshift range of 0.2 < z < 3.5 to align the simulated and observational datasets. The ML method achieved an F1-score of 89\\% for quiescent galaxies, significantly outperforming the SED-fitting method, which achieved 54%. The ML model demonstrated superior recall (88% vs. 38%) while maintaining comparable precision. When applied to the COSMOS2020 catalog, the ML model predicted a systematically higher fraction of quiescent galaxies across all redshift bins within 0.2 < z < 3.5 compared to traditional methods like NUVrJ and SED-fitting. This study shows that ML, combined with multi-wavelength data, can effectively identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies, providing valuable insights into galaxy evolution.

However, their origin remains poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of a septuple protostellar system embedded in a Keplerian disk within the high-mass star-forming region NGC\\,6334IN, with close separations of 181-461 AU. The stability analysis reveals that the disk surrounding the septuple system is dynamically unstable, indicating that the septuple system formed via disk fragmentation. Previous studies have typically found only 2--3 members forming via disk fragmentation in both low- and high-mass star-forming regions. Our findings provide compelling observational evidence that the fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable disk is a viable mechanism for the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity, confirming what was previously only a theoretical concept. The results shed new light on the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity in cluster environments.",

Submitted to MNRAS Letters (with minimal text changes from arXiv v1), comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The mass-metallicity relation is a fundamental galaxy scaling law that has been extended to the faintest systems in the Local Group. We show that the small scatter in this relation, which has been used to argue against tidal mass loss in Local Group satellites, is consistent with the level of disruption in the Auriga simulations. For every accreted system in Auriga, we compute stellar masses and metallicities two ways: considering the total system (bound + lost material) and only considering the progenitor. Accreted systems in Auriga have a tight relation between total stellar mass and metallicity, with scatter at a fixed stellar mass driven by age. When only considering the progenitor, the tidally evolved mass-metallicity relation has similar scatter ($\\sim$0.27 dex) as observed for the Local Group satellites ($\\sim$0.23 dex). Satellites that lie above the relation have experienced substantial mass loss and typically have low metallicity for their total stellar mass. Even satellites that fall exactly on the evolved relation can lose over half of their stellar mass. Only satellites substantially below the evolved relation are reliably intact. Based on their offset from the observed relation, we predict which Milky Way and M31 satellites have tidal tails waiting to be discovered.",

Zinnecker 15 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables, accepted to Astronomy & Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The fundamental process of star formation in galaxies involves the interplay between the fueling of star formation via molecular gas and the feedback from recently formed massive stars. This process, by which galaxies evolve, is also closely connected to the intrinsic properties of the interstellar medium (ISM). To study the role that different molecular and atomic phases of the ISM play in star formation, and to characterize their physical conditions, we zoom into our nearest neighboring galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC; 50 kpc). The LMC offers a view of the ISM and star formation conditions in a low metallicity environment similar to, in that regard, the epoch of the peak of star formation in the earlier universe. We present an unprecedentedly detailed analysis of a well-known star-forming regions (SFRs) at a spatial resolution of a few pc. We mapped a 610pcx260pc region in the LMC molecular ridge in [CII] and the [OIII] using the FIFI-LS instrument on the SOFIA telescope. We compare the data with the distribution of the CO (2-1) emission from ALMA, the modeled TIR luminosity as well as Spitzer/MIPS continuum and Halpha. We also provide a detailed description of the observing strategy and the data reduction. We find that [CII] and [OIII] emission is associated with the SFRs in the molecular ridge, but also extends throughout the mapped region, not obviously associated with ongoing star formation. The CO emission is clumpier than the [CII] emission and we find plentiful [CII] present where there is little CO emission, possibly holding important implications for CO-dark gas. We find a clear trend of the [CII]/TIR ratio decreasing with increasing TIR. This suggests a strong link between the [CII]-deficit and the local physical conditions instead of global properties.",

Solanki Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The intrinsic variability of stars, due to acoustic oscillations, surface granulation, and magnetic activity, introduces radial velocity (RV) jitter in spectral lines, obscuring true planetary signals and hindering the detection of Earth-like planets. Granulation is particularly challenging, as it affects even the most inactive stars introducing substantial signals, with amplitudes up to 1 m/s. Disentangling granulation-induced RV jitter from signal caused by planetary reflex motion requires reliable models of stellar granulation. In this study, we present a new approach for calculating sensitivities of spectral lines to granulation. We simulate near-surface convection with 3D radiative MHD code MURaM and calculate high-resolution emergent spectra with the radiative transfer code MPS-ATLAS. We then introduce a novel methodology that uses spatial variability of spectral lines across the granulation pattern at a single moment in time to compute their temporal variability. This approach significantly reduces computational costs. We apply our approach to analyze the response of lines from neutral and singly ionized elemental species to solar this http URL find a clear distinction between the two groups of lines: those from neutral elements tend to show stronger variations in line strength, whereas those from singly ionized elements exhibit larger variations in central wavelength. These results enable the development of spectral line masks tailored to granulation sensitivity, offering a promising strategy to reduce granulation-induced RV noise and improve exoplanet detection.",

One feature of the eruption is an extensive fan above the filament channel that is about three times as wide as similar structures that appear above active regions (ARs) during solar flares. The fan contains numerous supra-arcade downflows (SADs), and we investigate the largest SADs with continuous Hinode X-ray Telescope (XRT) observations. The measured maximum width of the SADs in this event is at least three times the maximum width of SADs observed in AR flares, whereas the velocities of the largest SADs are similar to the typical values of AR SADs. The kinetic characteristics of the largest SADs observed in this event align with previous model predictions, where SADs originate from the non-linear development of Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities. In this scenario, the larger system size allows the existence of larger-scale instabilities, while the development of the velocities of these instabilities is expected to be independent of the system size. Compared to AR flares, the temperature and emission measure in this event are lower, and there is less overall radiation, resulting in no evident Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) signature. Similar to those in AR flares, SADs show lower temperatures compared to the surrounding fan plasma. Our observations show that SADs are present in a wide variety of eruptions. The reconnection mechanisms present in quiescent filament eruptions are similar to those driving more compact eruptions originating from ARs.",

K P Raju Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The large-scale convection in the Sun known as supergranulation is manifested as a network structure on the solar surface. The network cells have an average lifetime of 24 hr, a size of about 30 Mm, and a lane width of about 6 Mm. We have obtained the lane widths and intensities at different latitudes from the Ca {\\sc ii} K spectroheliograms from the 100 yr Kodaikanal archival data. We have then calculated the cross correlation function of lane widths and intensities with sunspot number at every latitude from 60$^{\\circ}$ N to 60$^{\\circ}$ S. The correlation coefficients of the quantities show an approximate North-South symmetry with broad peaks around $\\pm$(11--22)$^{\\circ}$ latitude with values of about 0.8. The results imply that these latitudes follow the sunspot cycle strongly. The maximum correlation for the lane widths occurs (18$\\pm$2)$^{\\circ}$ N and (20$\\pm$2)$^{\\circ}$ S with no phase difference. For intensities, this happens at (13$\\pm$2)$^{\\circ}$ N and (14$\\pm$2)$^{\\circ}$ S with a phase difference of 1.25 to 1.5 yr. It is interesting to note that the lane width correlations peak during the solar maximum whereas the intensitiy correlations peak 1.25--1.5 yr after the solar maximum. The results, generally show that no unique latitude exactly follows the solar cycle for all quantities. The results are important in flux transport on the solar surface and have implications for the quiet Sun UV irradiance variations.",

Townsley 19 pages, 9 figures, and 1 table; submitted to ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Dwarf novae are a subset of cataclysmic variables that accrete material intermittently in short-duration outbursts with sometimes long quiescent intervals in between. During the quiescent state, the white dwarf (WD) photosphere may be observable. Some of these systems show periodic variability consistent with a non-radial oscillation. Asteroseismology has become a unique tool for the measurement of internal structure of the WDs, such as their masses, radii, temperatures and rotation profiles. A few stable periodicities have been observed for accreting WDs, but the lack of complete and accurate theoretical models has hindered the real diagnosis of the observed pulsations. Though the associated pulsations in accreting WDs are thought to be $g$-modes, some work in the literature suggests that these pulsations could be Rossby modes ($r$-modes). Here, to elucidate this, we present a first simultaneous analysis of $g$- and $r$-mode pulsations in accreting white dwarfs including a full computation of visibility accounting for the distribution of variation over the WD surface. We show that, up to the second lowest degree ($\\ell =2$), neither $g-$ nor $r$-modes have a clear advantage in visibility. Although a few retrograde $r$-mode orders exhibit a larger visibility, the low-order $g$ modes possess higher frequency in the star's frame, making them more likely to be driven within the convective driving scenario commonly applied to isolated WDs. Therefore, we favor a $g$-mode origin for the observed periods in accreting WDs, though $r$-modes will be important for stars with more observed modes.",

Selva Bharathi 16 pages, 10 figures, In ApJ press Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We investigate the solar origin and heliospheric evolution of an intense geomagnetic storm that occurred on March 23-24, 2023. Despite multiple candidate CMEs observed between March 19-21, a weak CME detected on March 19 at 18:00 UT was identified as the cause, originating from the eruption of a longitudinal-filament channel near center of the sun. The channel underwent a smooth transition to eruption phase without detectable low coronal signatures. Wide-angle heliospheric imaging revealed asymmetric expansion and acceleration by solar wind drag, achieving an average CME velocity of $\\approx$640 km/s. The radial evolution of the interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) was analyzed by three spacecraft in close radial alignment. Arrival times and propagation speeds were consistent across spacecraft, with a 21 hour delay between STEREO-A and WIND attributed to solar rotation and longitudinal separation. The ICME exhibits magnetic cloud (MC) signatures characterized by right-handed helicity, enhanced density at all three spacecraft. The MC underwent expansion (radial-size increases from 0.08AU at SolO to 0.18AU at STEREO-A), decrease in magnetic field strength with distance; $B_{av}\\propto R_H^{-1.97}$ (SolO-STA) and $B_{av}\\propto R_H^{-1.53}$ (SolO-WIND). The MC axis is inclined with the ecliptic at $-69^o$ at SolO, $-25^o$ at STA and $-34^o$ at WIND, indicating rotation during heliospheric transit. Importantly, the storm's main phase leads to a peak intensity ($SYM-H=-169$nT) occurring at 24/02:40UT followed by a second peak ($SYM-H=-170$nT) at 24/05:20UT due to density enhancement towards MC's tail. The study emphasizes the significant geoeffectiveness of weak, stealth CMEs with southward Bz and density enhancements.",

Abstract abridged as per arXiv directive Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) TOI-1203 is a bright (V=8.6) G3 V star known to host a transiting warm sub-Neptune on a 25.5 d orbit. Here we report on an intensive high-precision radial velocity and photometric follow-up campaign carried out with the HARPS spectrograph and the CHEOPS space telescope. We found that TOI-1203 has an enhancement of $\\alpha$ elements relative to iron of [$\\alpha$/Fe]=$0.21\\pm0.04$. With an age of $\\sim$12.5 Gyr, TOI-1203 belongs to the old, $\\alpha$-element enhanced stellar population of the galactic thick disk. We spectroscopically confirmed the planetary nature of the 25.5 d sub-Neptune TOI-1203 d, measured its mass ($M_{d}=7.39\\pm0.62~M_{\\oplus}$) and refined its radius ($R_{d}=2.918_{-0.045}^{+0.046}~R_{\\oplus}$). We discovered the presence of an additional transiting super-Earth on a 4.2 d orbit (TOI-1203 b) with a mass of $M_{b}=3.51_{-0.32}^{+0.33}~M_{\\oplus}$ and a radius of $R_{b}=1.520_{-0.046}^{+0.045}~R_{\\oplus}$. We also revealed the presence of two additional low-mass planets at 13.1 d and 204.6 d (TOI-1203 c and e), with minimum masses of $5.46_{-0.50}^{+0.51}~M_{\\oplus}$ and $42.10_{-1.78}^{+1.83}~M_{\\oplus}$. We found that the outer planet TOI-1203 e lies on an eccentric orbit with $e_{e}=0.152\\pm0.029$. We performed a stability analysis of the system confirming that there are configurations consistent with the observed parameters that are dynamically stable over billion-year timescales. While analyzing the HARPS time series, we discovered that the FWHM of the HARPS cross-correlation function shows a significant long-period signal ($\\sim$615 d) that has no counterpart in the radial velocity data or in the remaining HARPS ancillary time series. We significantly detected the same signal in the FWHM of the Th-Ar calibration lines used to compute the nightly wavelength solution, and attributed this systematic effect to a long-term variation of the HARPS instrumental profile.",

      "abstract": "The frequency-independent radio luminosity -- orbital/rotational period relation of RS CVn stars Qichen Huang, Biwei Jiang Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Radio emissions from RS CVn objects exhibit distinct characteristics at low and high frequencies, widely attributed to differing radiation mechanisms. The disparate processes of high-frequency gyrosynchrotron and low-frequency electron cyclotron maser emissions have traditionally suggested an absence of correlation in their radio luminosities. Our study presents a frequency-independent linear correlation between radio luminosity ($L_R$) and orbital/rotational periods ($P$) in RS CVn binaries. Analyzing the Sydney Radio Star Catalogue (SRSC) data, we derived orbital periods for 42 of 60 RS CVn sources using TESS light curves, revealing a strong positive correlation (PCC = 0.698, $P$ = 3.95e-7) between $\\log_{10}L_R$ and $\\log_{10}P$. This correlation remains across frequencies from 144-3000 MHz, showing uniform luminosity behavior. By combining light curve analysis with stellar mass-radius-luminosity relationships, we calculated parameters like binary mass, primary/secondary mass, Rossby number, and binary separation for eight RS CVn systems. The results show a notable correlation between radio luminosity and binary mass, primary mass, and separation (PCC = 0.663, 0.663, 0.719), with separation showing the strongest correlation. This suggests the radio emission may largely originate from the binary components' interaction, challenging existing models of RS CVn radio emission mechanisms and offering insights into the individual versus collective origins of these emissions.",

Dittmann 22 pages, 17 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Modelling the gravitational interaction between an eccentric perturber and a differentially shearing gas disc is a longstanding problem with various astrophysical applications, ranging from the evolution of planetary systems to the migration of black holes embedded in AGN discs. Recent work has advanced a global, linear, modal approach for calculating the excited wake and the resulting feedback on the perturber's orbital evolution. In this work we perform a complementary suite of targeted hydrodynamic simulations to test this linear framework across a range of disc temperature and density profiles. In particular, we push from circular orbits to highly eccentric trajectories for which the perturber moves supersonically with respect to the background gas. We find remarkable agreement between our simulations and the linear methodology across a range of diagnostics -- lending support to the predicted wake morphologies, complex radial torque density profiles, and torque reversal phenomena, which occur when the eccentricity exceeds the local aspect ratio. In contrast, comparison with previous fitting functions exposes noticeable discrepancies, cautioning against their indiscriminate use in studies which explore a wide range of perturber eccentricities, in varied disc structures. Our simulations also probe the fundamentally nonlinear effects of shock induced angular momentum deposition and coorbital horseshoe drags, which exhibit clear variations with eccentricity. Finally, this careful comparison between linear theory and numerics provides a detailed benchmark for planet-disc interaction problems and therefore we have provided a repository of our linear calculations for use as a rigorous test of future numerical investigations.",

We discuss intermediate survey diagnostics, including calibration of the known RV zero point offset introduced following the Contreras fire in 2022 and the identification of an undiagnosed and previously unknown zero point offset in 2021. An analysis of our data set using RVSearch demonstrates that for these target stars, NEID is independently sensitive to nearly all known planets with periods shorter than the NETS observing baseline.

Broadband ozone absorption features are key biosignatures that appear in the 200-400nm near-ultraviolet (UV) regime. Extending coronagraphy from visible wavelengths to the UV, however, brings with it a number of challenges, including tighter requirements on wavefront sensing and control, optical surface quality, scattered light, and polarization aberrations, among other things. We aim to partially quantify and address these challenges with a combination of modeling, high-resolution metrology to the scales required for UV coronagraphy, and ultimately a demonstration of UV coronagraphy on the Space Coronagraph Optical Bench (SCoOB) vacuum testbed. In these proceedings, we provide a status update on our modeling and contrast budgeting efforts, characterization efforts to understand performance limitations set by key optical components, and our plans to move toward a demonstration of UV coronagraphy.",

Medium-resolution IFS, such as MUSE at the VLT, are equipped to detect the emission lines of faint accreting companions when associated with dedicated stellar halo subtraction methods. We recently proposed a new approach based on polynomial modulations of a stellar spectrum estimate across the field of view, with orthogonal polynomials and lines masking. Aims. We seek to highlight and quantify analytically and on real data the benefits of this new approach over the one classically used, particularly with regard to distortions of the extracted spectra. Methods. We carried out analytical calculations based on simple toy models. Simulations of the most extreme situations identified were used to highlight these problems and corrections. Archival VLT/MUSE data of the young PDS70 and HTLup systems were used to vet the detection and characterization capabilities using on-sky observations. New images of the YSES1 planetary system were used to further illustrate the gains. Results. We show that the state-of-the-art method, based on low-pass filtering, can lead to the self-subtraction of the emission lines and modify the neighboring continua. We show that the proposed technique corrects these characterization problems, while maintaining the same detection capabilities. The two protoplanets PDS70 b and c were detected with 5sigma significance. The Halpha line estimate of the HTLup B stellar companion was improved by ~30% for the integrated flux and by ~8% for the 10%-width. As for YSES1 b, we found it uniquely displays a combination of Halpha, Hbeta, CaII H&K triplet, and HeI lines in emission. Conclusions. The proposed method better preserves the spectral information, notably the emission line fluxes and profiles, while achieving similar detection performance. Based on a linear and parametric approach, it can be extended and/or combined with additional faint signal search algorithms.",

Our code, mircxpol, is published in this https URL Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Polarimetric data provide key insights into infrared emission mechanisms in the inner disks of YSOs and the details of dust formation around AGB stars. While polarization measurements are well-established in radio interferometry, they remain challenging at visible and near-infrared due to the significant time-variable birefringence introduced by the complex optical beamtrain. In this study, we characterize instrumental polarization effects within the optical path of the CHARA Array, focusing on the H-band MIRC-X and K-band MYSTIC beam combiners. Using Jones matrix formalism, we developed a comprehensive model describing diattenuation and retardance across the array. By applying this model to an unpolarized calibrator, we derived the instrumental parameters for both MIRC-X and MYSTIC. Our results show differential diattenuation consistent with >= 97% reflectivity per aluminum-coated surface at 45 deg incidence. The differential retardance exhibits small wavelength-dependent variations, in some cases larger than we expected. Notably, telescope W2 exhibits a significantly larger phase shift in the Coude path, attributable to a fixed aluminum mirror (M4) used in place of deformable mirrors present on the other telescopes during the observing run. We also identify misalignments in the LiNbO_3 birefringent compensator plates on S1 (MIRC-X) and W2 (MYSTIC). After correcting for night-to-night offsets, we achieve calibration accuracies of $\\pm$ 3.4% in visibility ratio and $\\pm$ 1.4 deg in differential phase for MIRC-X, and $\\pm$ 5.9% and $\\pm$ 2.4 deg, respectively, for MYSTIC. Given that the differential intrinsic polarization of spatially resolved sources, such as AGB stars and YSOs, typically greater than these instrumental uncertainties, our results demonstrate that CHARA is now capable of achieving high-accuracy measurements of intrinsic polarization in astrophysical targets.",

Nanni Accelerator Physics (physics.acc-ph); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The low-level RF (LLRF) systems for linear accelerating structures are typically based on heterodyne architectures. The linear accelerators normally have many RF stations and multiple RF inputs and outputs for each station, so the complexity and size of the LLRF system grows rapidly when scaling up. To meet the design goals of being compact and affordable for future accelerators, or upgrading existing ones, we have developed and characterized the next generation LLRF (NG-LLRF) platform based on the RF system-on-chip (RFSoC) for S-band and C-band accelerating structures. The integrated RF data converters in RFSoC sample and generate the RF signals directly without any analogue mixing circuits, which significantly simplified the architecture compared with the conventional LLRF systems. We have performed high-power tests for the NG-LLRF with the S-band accelerating structure in the Next Linear Collider Test Accelerator (NLCTA) test facility at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and a C-band structure prototyped for Cool Cooper Collider (CCC). The NG-LLRF platform demonstrated pulse-to-pulse fluctuation levels considerably better than the requirements of the targeted applications and high precision and flexibility in generating and measuring the RF pulses. In this paper, the characterization results of the platform with different system architectures will be summarized and a selection of high-power test results of the NG-LLRF will be presented and analyzed.",

In this representation, the detector is a correlation between the corresponding time-frequency distributions. Since Bertrand's class is related to the power-law chirp signals, the new representation can be useful for their detection. The new approach is shown to be more effective then other time-frequency methods for the case of phase-insensitive detection.

Although a number of satellites and ground-based networks measure the total column volume mixing ratio (VMR) of these gases, they rely on sunlight, and column measurements at night are comparatively scarce. We present a new algorithm, Astroclimes, that hopes to complement and extend nighttime CO$_2$ and CH4 column measurements. Astroclimes can measure the abundance of GHGs on Earth by generating a model telluric transmission spectra and fitting it to the spectra of telluric standard stars in the near-infrared taken by ground-based telescopes. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis on an extensive dataset from the CARMENES spectrograph showed that Astroclimes was able to recover the long term trend known to be present in the molecular abundances of both CO$_2$ and CH$_4$, but not their seasonal cycles. Using the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) global greenhouse gas reanalysis model (EGG4) as a benchmark, we identified an overall vertical shift in our data and quantified the long term scatter in our retrievals. The scatter on a 1 hour timescale, however, is much lower, and is on par with the uncertainties on individual measurements. Although currently the precision of the method is not in line with state of the art techniques using dedicated instrumentation, it shows promise for further development.",

In this process, an incident photon deposits a fraction of its energy at the point of incidence and continues onwards with a change in direction that depends on the amount of energy deposited. By using a pair of detectors to detect the point of incidence and the direction of the scattered photon, we can calculate the scattering direction and angle. The position of a source in the sky can be reconstructed using many Compton photon pairs from a source. We demonstrate this principle in the laboratory by using a pair of Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) detectors sensitive in the energy range of 20-200 keV, similar to those used in $\\textit{AstroSat}$/CZT Imager (CZTI). The laboratory setup consists of the two detectors placed perpendicular to each other in a lead-lined box. The detectors are read out by a custom-programmed Xilinx PYNQ-Z2 FPGA board, and data are then transferred to a personal computer (PC)}. There are two key updates from CZTI: the detectors are read concurrently rather than serially, and the time resolution has been improved from $20~\\mu$s to $7.5~\\mu$s. We irradiated the detectors with a collimated $^{133}\\mathrm{Ba}$ source and identified Compton scattering events for the 356 keV line. We run a Compton reconstruction algorithm to correctly infer the location of the source in the detector frame, with a location-dependent angular response measure of $16°-30°$. This comprises a successful technology demonstration for a Compton imaging camera in the hard X-ray regime. We present the details of our setup, the data acquisition process, and software algorithms, and showcase our results. We also quantify the limitations of this setup and discuss ways of improving the performance in future experiments.",

      "abstract": "ImageMM: Joint multi-frame image restoration and super-resolution Yashil Sukurdeep, Tamás Budavári, Andrew J. Connolly, Fausto Navarro Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) A key processing step in ground-based astronomy involves combining multiple noisy and blurry exposures to produce an image of the night sky with an improved signal-to-noise ratio. Typically, this is achieved via image coaddition, and can be undertaken such that the resulting night sky image has enhanced spatial resolution. Yet, this task remains a formidable challenge despite decades of advancements. In this paper, we introduce ImageMM: a new framework based on the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm for joint multi-frame astronomical image restoration and super-resolution. ImageMM uses multiple registered astronomical exposures to produce a nonparametric latent image of the night sky, prior to the atmosphere's impact on the observed exposures. Our framework also features a novel variational approach to compute refined point-spread functions of arbitrary resolution for the restoration and super-resolution procedure. Our algorithms, implemented in TensorFlow, leverage graphics processing unit acceleration to produce latent images in near real time, even when processing high-resolution exposures. We tested ImageMM on Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) exposures, which are a precursor of the upcoming imaging data from the Rubin Observatory. The results are encouraging: ImageMM produces sharp latent images, in which spatial features of bright sources are revealed in unprecedented detail (e.g., showing the structure of spiral galaxies), and where faint sources that are usually indistinguishable from the noisy sky background also become discernible, thus pushing the detection limits. Moreover, aperture photometry performed on the HSC pipeline coadd and ImageMM's latent images yielded consistent source detection and flux measurements, thereby demonstrating ImageMM's suitability for cutting-edge photometric studies with state-of-the-art astronomical imaging data.",

We describe the development and application of the \\texttt{TESS-miner} package and associated vetting procedures used in this analysis.

Our pipeline demonstrates high sensitivity across all M-dwarf subtypes within the injection bounds. We estimate the occurrence rates of short-period GEMS as a function of stellar mass, and combine our measured occurrence rates with those derived for FGK stars and fit an exponential trend with stellar mass, consistent with core-accretion theory predictions.

Turner 26 pages, 16 figures, resubmitted to AJ after first round of peer review Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Ultra-hot Jupiters exhibit day-to-night temperature contrasts upwards of 1000 K due to competing effects of strong winds, short radiative timescales, magnetic drag, and H2 dissociation/recombination. Spectroscopic phase curves provide critical insights into these processes by mapping temperature distributions and constraining the planet's energy budget across different pressure levels. Here, we present the first NIRISS/SOSS phase curve of an ultra-hot Jupiter, WASP-121 b. The instrument's bandpass [0.6 - 2.85 micron] captures an estimated 50-83% of the planet's bolometric flux, depending on orbital phase, allowing for unprecedented constraints on the planet's global energy budget; previous measurements with HST/WFC3 and JWST/NIRSpec/G395H captured roughly 20% of the planetary flux. Accounting for the unobserved regions of the spectrum, we estimate effective day and nightside temperatures of T_day = 2717 +/- 17 K and T_night = 1562 +/- 19 K corresponding to a Bond albedo of A_B = 0.277 +/- 0.016 and a heat recirculation efficiency of epsilon = 0.246 +/- 0.014. Matching the phase-dependent effective temperature with energy balance models yields a similar Bond albedo of 0.3 and a mixed layer pressure of 1 bar consistent with photospheric pressures, but unexpectedly slow winds of 0.2 km/s, indicative of inefficient heat redistribution. The shorter optical wavelengths of the NIRISS/SOSS Order 2 yield a geometric albedo of A_g = 0.093 +/- 0.029 (3 sigma upper limit of 0.175), reinforcing the unexplained trend of hot Jupiters exhibiting larger Bond albedos than geometric albedos. We also detect near-zero phase curve offsets for wavelengths above 1.5 micron, consistent with inefficient heat transport, while shorter wavelengths potentially sensitive to reflected light show eastward offsets.",

We compared synthetic populations from the Generation 3 Bern Model of Planet Formation and Evolution (core accretion, solar-type host stars) and the HARPS/Coralie radial velocity sample. We biased the synthetic planet population according to the completeness of the observed data and performed quantitative statistical comparisons and systematically identified agreements and differences. Our nominal population reproduces many of the main features of the HARPS planets: two main groups of planets (close-in sub-Neptunes and distant giants), a bimodal mass function with a less populated `desert', an observed mean multiplicity of about 1.6, and several key correlations. The remaining discrepancies point to areas that are not fully captured in the model. For instance, we find that the synthetic population has 1) in absolute terms too many planets by ~70%, 2) a `desert' that is too deep by ~60%, 3) a relative excess of giant planets by ~40%, 4) planet eccentricities that are on average too low by a factor of about two (median of 0.07 versus 0.15), and 5) a metallicity effect that is too weak. Finally, the synthetic planets are overall too close to the star compared to the HARPS sample. The differences allowed us to find model parameters that better reproduce the observed planet masses, for which we computed additional synthetic populations. We find that physical processes appear to be missing and that planets may originate on wider orbits than our model predicts. Mechanisms leading to higher eccentricities and slower disc-limited gas accretion also seem necessary. We advocate that theoretical models should make a quantitative comparison between the many current and future large surveys to better understand the origins of planetary systems. (Abridged.)",

Tholen, Jianchun Shi, Xian Shi, Richard Wainscoat Under review in A&A. Comments are welcome Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We studied C/2025 D1 (Groeller), a long-period comet with an unprecedented perihelion distance of 14.1 au, using archival observations. The data reveals that it had been active at inbound heliocentric distances $r_{\\rm H} \\gtrsim 20$ au. Initially, the comet intrinsically brightened at $r_{\\rm H} \\gtrsim 16$ au, with brightening parameters comparable to those of other long-period comets. However, observations after late 2023 showed a gradual decay, despite the inbound trajectory of the comet. To our knowledge, such behaviours have not been observed for other long-period comets at similar heliocentric distances. We speculate that this might be linked to the onset of CO$_{2}$ sublimation and/or crystallisation processes. The surface brightness profile of the coma indicates a steady-state mass loss, implying supervolatile sublimation as the primary driver of the observed activity. Despite changes in the orbital plane angle, the circularly symmetric coma persisted throughout the observed period, indicative of the dominance of large grains in the coma. Assuming the activity trend is independent of bandpass, we found that comet was redder than many other solar system comets. Our model-dependent constraint estimates the nucleus radius to be $\\gtrsim\\!0.4$ km. We performed astrometric measurements, refined the orbital solution, and derived the original and future orbits of the comet. Our N-body integration, accounting for the Galactic tide, strongly favours that the comet is dynamically new, with its previous perihelion at $\\gtrsim\\!60$ au from the Sun $\\gtrsim\\!6$ Myr ago. It is highly likely that the comet will be lost from our solar system after the current apparition.",

      "abstract": "Initial conditions for tidal synchronisation of a planet by its moon Valeri V. Makarov, Michael Efroimsky Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Moons tidally interact with their host planets and stars. A close moon is quickly synchronised by the planet, or becomes captured in a higher spin-orbit resonance. However, the planet requires much more time to significantly alter its rotation rate under the influence of moon-generated tides. The situation becomes more complex for close-in planets, as star-generated tides come into play and compete with the moon-generated tides. Synchronisation of the planet by its moon changes the tidal dynamics of the entire star-planet-moon system and can lead to long-term stable configurations. In this paper, we demonstrate that a certain initial condition must be met for this to occur. Based on the angular-momentum conservation, the derived condition is universal and bears no dependence upon the planet's internal structure or tidal dissipation model. It is applicable to dwindling systems as well as tidally expanding orbits, and to the cases of initially retrograde motion. We present calculations for specific planet-moon systems (Earth and the Moon; Neptune and Triton; Venus and its hypothetical presently-extinct moon Neith; Mars, Phobos, and Deimos; Pluto and Charon), to constrain the dynamically plausible formation and evolution scenarios. Among other things, our analysis prompts the question of whether Pluto and Charon evolved into their current state from an initially more compact configuration (as is commonly assumed) or from a wider orbit -- a topic to be discussed at length elsewhere. Our results are equally applicable to exoplanets. For example, if asynchronous close-in exoplanets are detected, the possibility of tidal synchronisation by an exomoon should be considered.",

The absence of a detectable cometary xenon signature in the present-day Martian atmosphere suggests that the capture of solar nebular gas was significant enough to dilute later cometary contributions. By quantifying the mass of cometary material efficiently retained on Mars, we place a lower bound on the mass of the primordial Martian atmosphere. To test the robustness of our conclusions, we use cometary bombardment data from two independent studies conducted within a solar system evolutionary model consistent with its current structure. Our calculations show that, even under the most conservative scenario, the minimal mass of the primordial martian atmospheres would yield a surface pressure of no less than 2.9 bar. Such a massive nebular envelope is consistent with recent models in which atmospheric capture is strongly enhanced by the presence of heavier species on Mars - due to outgassing or redox buffering with a magma ocean.",

We present a new forward-modeling technique for ground-based stellar occultations based on wavelet decomposition. If profiles of refractivity are written as the product of an exponential and a wavelet decomposition, then we can analytically write the profiles of the bending angles and the bending angle derivatives that are needed to calculate occultation light curves.

Elucidating the mechanisms responsible for the generation of this field is critical for understanding atmospheric escape and the evolution of habitability on terrestrial planets. Yet, existing comparisons between ambipolar diffusion theory and in-situ potential measurements have largely neglected the effect of electron heat flow. Confronting the theory incorporating heat-flow effect with in-situ electrical potential data from the \\textit{Endurance} sounding rocket mission, we identify observational signatures of electron heat-flow effects. Furthermore, the implications of electron heat-flow effect across terrestrial planets are revealed, focusing on its capacity to resolve the enigma of Venusian electric potential drop anomaly. The anisotropic ion temperatures and the associated enhancement of electron heat-flow effect can explain the anomalous electric potential drop observed in the ionosphere of Venus.",

Pankaj Mehta, Jane Kondev Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech) In the 1970s, the renowned physicist Victor Weisskopf famously developed a research program to qualitatively explain properties of matter in terms of the fundamental constants of physics. But there was one type of matter prominently missing from Weisskopf's analysis: life. Here, we develop Weisskopf-style arguments demonstrating how the fundamental constants of physics can be used to understand the properties of living systems. By combining biophysical arguments and dimensional analysis, we show that vital properties of chemical self-replicators, such as growth yield, minimum doubling time, and minimum power consumption in dormancy, can be quantitatively estimated using fundamental physical constants. The calculations highlight how the laws of physics constrain chemistry-based life on Earth, and if it exists, elsewhere in our universe.",

Schäfer Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) There is a growing number of Earth's co-orbital bodies being discovered. At least five of them are known to be temporarily in quasi-satellite orbits. One of those, 469219 Kamo'oalewa, was identified as possibly having the same composition as the Moon. We explore the conditions necessary for lunar ejecta to evolve into Earth's co-orbital bodies, with particular attention to the formation of quasi-satellite orbits. We systematically investigate the parameter space of ejection velocity and geographic launch location across the entire lunar surface. The study employs numerical simulations of the four-body problem (Sun-Earth-Moon-particle) with automated classification methodology for identifying all co-orbital states. Particles are ejected from randomly distributed points covering the entire lunar surface with velocities ranging from 1.0 to 2.6 times the Moon's escape velocity. Trajectories co-orbital to Earth are found to be a common outcome, with approximately 6.15% of all simulated particles evolving into Earth co-orbital motion and 1.92% specifically exhibiting quasi-satellite behavior. We identify an optimal ejection velocity (1.2 times escape velocity) for quasi-satellite production, yielding over 6% conversion efficiency at this specific velocity. The spatial distribution of successful ejections shows a strong preference for the equatorial regions of the trailing hemisphere. Collisions with Earth or the Moon occur for only 4% of the sample. Our results strengthen the plausibility of lunar origin for Earth's co-orbital bodies, including quasi-satellites like Kamo'oalewa and 2024 PT5. We identify both \"prompt\" and \"delayed\" co-orbital formation mechanisms, with a steady-state production regime that could explain the presence of lunar-derived objects in Earth's co-orbital regions despite the infrequent occurrence of major lunar impacts capable of launching meter-scale fragments.",
