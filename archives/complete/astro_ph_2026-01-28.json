First, constraints on deviations from the standard weak interaction freeze-out temperature are derived using the most recent measurements of the primordial helium-4 mass fraction. Second, we perform a joint analysis incorporating five priors: Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic chronometers, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, and Cosmic Microwave Background in order to place bounds on the model parameters. The joint likelihood analysis significantly tightens the constraints compared to individual datasets. Third, we test the null, strong, and dominant energy conditions to evaluate the physical viability of the best-fit solutions across the cosmic redshift range. Our results show that all three f(T,B) models are consistent with current observations and exhibit stable behavior under the energy-condition criteria, supporting torsion-boundary modified gravity as a robust and viable alternative to General Relativity.",

Our prescription provides curvature- and projection-dependent phase features that are not recovered by local-expansion-based treatments. We perform parameter-space surveys and mock parameter inferences assuming the nominal sensitivity of the Einstein Telescope (ET) to identify the regime where the time-varying LOSA allows for separate constraints on the outer orbital parameters, in particular the tertiary mass and distance. We estimate that ET may detect a few to tens of such systems per year, provided that all binaries merge dynamically, and demonstrate that these constraints can be used to directly discriminate between a dynamical and AGN origin for BBHs. Finally, we reanalyse the GW190814 event and four O4a events finding no evidence for LOSA, with the previously claimed LOSA in GW190814 disappearing when a sufficiently long data segment is used.",

At the MeV scale, Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis constrains the fractional variation of the weak freeze-out temperature, |{\\delta}{\\tau}_f/{\\tau}_f|, thereby mapping light-element abundances into limits on deviations from the standard expansion history. At low redshift, we confront the model with type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and cosmic-chronometer data, which respectively probe distances, the late-time standard ruler, and the Hubble rate. Independent analyses highlight the complementary roles of each dataset, while a joint SNe Ia + BAO + CC fit breaks degeneracies and yields the tightest combined bounds. As an illustration, we examine two representative torsion-modified gravity scenarios: BBN strongly limits large departures from standard cosmology, whereas late-time probes remain compatible with a near-{\\Lambda}CDM background. This unified approach demonstrates the power of linking early-Universe nuclear physics with precision cosmological observables in assessing torsional extensions of gravity.",

We study the system in two physically distinct regimes: the near degenerate low temperature limit, and the high temperature regime. In the low temperature regime, we derive the thermodynamic quantities using the standard Sommerfeld expansion. In the high temperature regime, we evaluate all thermodynamic quantities numerically from the exact grand canonical potential and demonstrate that the thermodynamics of the Fermi gas reduces to the standard relativistic ideal gas behavior. We apply the resulting low temperature equation of state to study compact astrophysical objects, namely, non rotating white dwarfs and neutron stars. Helium white dwarfs exhibit a strong dependence on the deformation scale, while white dwarfs composed of heavier elements are less affected. For neutron stars, the modified equation of state leads to configurations that are smaller in radius and lower in mass than is by nucleonic equations of state. Our results highlight how modified relativity theories can be probed by studying astrophysical objects.",

Among competing models, the collapse of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos provide a plausible explanation for early SMBH formation. While previous studies on modeling the gravothermal collapse of SIDM halos have primarily focused on non-relativistic evolution under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, We advance this framework by relaxing the equilibrium assumption and additionally incorporating general-relativistic effects. To this end, we introduce the Misner-Sharp formalism to the SIDM context for the first time. Our model reproduces the standard hydrostatic models in the early long-mean-free-path (LMFP) regime, but displays interesting distinct behavior in the late short-mean-free-path (SMFP) regime, where intense outward heat flux drives a rapid expansion of the outer envelope, removing mass from the core and significantly decelerating the collapse. Our general relativistic treatment enables us to follow halo evolution to the final stage when the apparent horizon forms. Our simulation yields a seed black hole mass of approximately $3\\times10^{-8}$ of the halo mass at horizon formation, suggesting that additional mechanisms such as baryonic effects are critical for seeding black holes that are sufficiently massive to account for SMBHs in the early Universe.",

If the horizon entanglement entropy falls slightly below the Bekenstein-Hawking value, we parametrize the shortfall by a fractional deficit $\\delta(a)$ evolving with the FLRW scale factor $a$. The associated equipartition deficit at the Gibbons-Hawking temperature then sources a smooth, homogeneous component whose density scales as $H^{2}/G$, with a dimensionless coefficient $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ of order unity times $\\delta(a)$. Because this component tracks $H^{2}$, it is negligible at early times but can activate at redshifts $z\\lesssim 1$, raising the late time expansion rate by a few percent without affecting recombination or the sound horizon. We present a minimal three parameter activation model for $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ and derive its impact on the background expansion, effective equation of state, and linear growth for a smooth entanglement sector. The framework predicts a small boost in $H(z)$, a mild suppression of $f\\sigma_{8}(z)$, and a corresponding modification of the low-$z$ distance-redshift relation. We test these predictions against current low-redshift data sets, including SN~Ia distance moduli, baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements, cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, and redshift space distortion constraints, and discuss whether the $H_0$ tension can be consistently interpreted as a late-time, horizon-scale information deficit rather than an early universe modification.",

These noises contributions are computed in the frame of the Virgo detector and a sensitivity curve is calculated.

Zen Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Galaxy clusters are the largest virialized structures in the Universe and are predominantly dominated by dark matter. The hydrostatic mass and the mass obtained from gravitational lensing measurements generally differ, a discrepancy known as the hydrostatic mass bias. In this work, we derive the hydrostatic mass of galaxy clusters within the framework of Rastall gravity and investigate its implications under two scenarios: (i) the absence of dark matter and (ii) the existence of dark matter. In the first scenario, Rastall gravity effectively reduces the hydrostatic mass, bringing it closer to the observed baryonic mass. The best linear fit yields a slope $\\mathbf{M}=1.07\\pm0.11$, indicating a near one-to-one correspondence between the two masses. In the second scenario, Rastall gravity helps to alleviate the hydrostatic mass bias. The linear fit between the Rastall hydrostatic mass and the observed lensing mass results in a best-fit slope $\\mathbf{M}=1.01\\pm0.16$, which is very close to unity. These results suggest that Rastall gravity provides a statistically favorable framework for addressing mass discrepancies in galaxy clusters.",

Saridakis Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We show that Schwarzschild primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the radiation-dominated era can grow extremely rapidly through $\\textit{radiative absorption}$ governed by the full Stefan-Boltzmann law. By introducing a principle of isonomy - ensuring identical particle species dependence for Hawking emission and absorption - we find that, whenever the temperature of the PBH environment is larger than the PBH horizon temperature, PBHs generically gain mass. In particular, for PBH masses following the critical collapse mass-scaling law with critical exponent $\\gamma_\\mathrm{crit}$, with $\\gamma_\\mathrm{crit} \\in (0.33, 0.49)$, the aforementioned radiative absorption mass growth mechanism produces a striking effect: PBHs forming with a mass $10^6M_\\odot$ during BBN can reach $\\mathcal{O}(10^{10} M_\\odot)$ within $\\mathcal{O}(10^{6} \\mathrm{s})$ ($\\sim $ 58 days). Interestingly enough, small deviations from $\\gamma_\\mathrm{crit}$, depending itself on the number of relativistic species present in the primordial plasma, yield a continuous PBH mass spectrum providing us ultimately with a single, Standard-Model-based explanation for the origin of stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black holes (SMBHs), and naturally accounting for the early appearance of SMBHs. The Schwarzschild treatment presented here can be extended to spherically symmetric cosmological black holes, indicating that radiative absorption is a dominant and previously overlooked PBH growth channel in the early Universe.",

These templates are derived without assuming a particular inflaton potential, within a background history consisting of an initial kinetically dominated phase followed by an ultra-slow-roll inflationary regime, thereby isolating the universal imprints of curvature on tensor modes. Our results predict characteristic large-scale features -- including low-$\\ell$ cut-offs and oscillatory patterns -- that are consistent with numerical solutions and provide a clear physical interpretation of how curvature modifies the underlying dynamics. In particular, we show that curvature effects manifest mathematically as systematic shifts in the dynamically relevant wavevectors, mirroring the behaviour previously identified in the scalar power spectrum. These features translate into distinctive signatures in the large-angle $B$-mode polarisation spectrum, offering a potential discriminant for spatial curvature in forthcoming CMB observations.",

Within the framework, this article investigates how a smooth coarse-graining procedure affects the resulting PBH mass function. As a demonstrative example, we employ a Gaussian window function, for which the stochastic noise becomes fully correlated across scales. It is found that these correlated noises result in a mass function of PBHs, whose maximum and its neighbourhood are predominantly determined by the probability that the density contrast exceeds a given threshold at each mass scale. Our results clarify the role of noise correlations induced by smooth coarse-graining and highlight their importance in predicting the abundance of PBHs.",

The numerical analysis files used for the construction of the figures may be found at this https URL Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) The Hubble tension is commonly framed as a discrepancy between local, late-time measurements favoring $H_0 \\approx 73$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and early-time, Sound-Horizon-based measurements favoring $H_0 \\approx 67$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We challenge this viewpoint by analyzing 88 Sound Horizon Free $H_0$ measurements, categorized into four classes: Distance Ladder measurements using local calibrators; Local $\\Lambda$CDM measurements assuming the standard expansion history; Pure Local measurements independent of $H(z)$ shape; and CMB Sound--Horizon--Free measurements using CMB data without the Sound Horizon scale. Our analysis reveals that the 30 Distance Ladder measurements yield $H_0 = 72.73 \\pm 0.39$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($\\chi^2_\\nu = 0.72$), while the 58 Distance Ladder-Independent/Sound Horizon Free measurements collectively yield $H_0 = 69.37 \\pm 0.34$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($\\chi^2_\\nu = 0.95$), a $6.5\\sigma$ tension exceeding the Planck--SH0ES discrepancy. This tension remains significant at a minimum value of $3.9\\sigma$ after accounting for correlations. Among categories, Local $\\Lambda$CDM measurements favor the lowest value ($H_0 = 67.61\\pm 0.96$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), Pure Local yield an intermediate value ($H_0 = 71.03 \\pm 0.69$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), and CMB Sound Horizon Free measurements give $H_0 = 69.07 \\pm 0.44$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We conclude that the Hubble tension is better characterized as a discrepancy between the Distance Ladder and all other methodologies, rather than an early-vs-late-time split. We also identify a $2.9\\sigma$ internal tension among Distance Ladder Independent/Sound Horizon Free measurements: analyses assuming $\\Lambda$CDM systematically recover lower $H_0$ values compared to cosmological-model-independent methods.

Traditionally, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used as a flexible machine learning method to mitigate non-Gaussian noise. However, training CNNs requires many data samples, especially when the input data segments are long. Glitches that mimic high-mass black hole signals are empirically known to have a wavelet-like structure. We exploit this property in $\\texttt{WaveletNet}$ by using simple neural networks to learn the best family of wavelets to model glitches in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 data. Due to its simplicity, our framework is significantly more sample-efficient than CNNs. As a use case, we build upon the $\\texttt{TIER}$ method and show how $\\texttt{WaveletNet}$ can improve the performance of any search pipeline. We take potential GW candidates from the pipeline, and then downweight the candidates having noisy strain regions in their vicinity. We use our framework in a modular way: we provide an output score which can be added to the pipeline's existing detection statistic score for the candidates.

Weaver Published in Nature Astronomy, 2026 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Ordinary matter-including particles such as protons and neutrons-accounts for only about one sixth of all matter in the Universe. The rest is dark matter, which does not emit or absorb light but plays a fundamental role in galaxy and structure evolution. Because it interacts only through gravity, one of the most direct probes is weak gravitational lensing: the deflection of light from distant galaxies by intervening mass. Here we present an extremely detailed, wide-area weak-lensing mass map, covering 0.77 deg x 0.70 deg, using high-resolution imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as part of the COSMOS-Web survey. By measuring the shapes of 129 galaxies per square arcminute-many independently in the F115W and F150W bands-we achieve an angular resolution of 1.00 +/- 0.01 arcmin. Our map has more than twice the resolution of earlier Hubble Space Telescope maps, revealing how dark and luminous matter co-evolve across filaments, clusters, and under-densities. It traces mass features out to z ~ 2, including the most distant structure at z ~ 1.1. The sensitivity to high-redshift lensing constrains galaxy environments at the peak of cosmic star formation and sets a high-resolution benchmark for testing theories about the nature of dark matter and the formation of large-scale cosmic structure",

Wali Hossain, Amare Abebe, Prabhakar Tiwari, Xuelei Chen, Jackson Said, Jacob Oloketuyi Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present constraints on quintessence dark energy models using the observational detection of the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW)--thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) cross-correlation dataset. Our analysis compares three classes of quintessence dynamics: thawing, tracker, and scaling-freezing with the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Through a comprehensive likelihood analysis, we derive best-fit values and 68\\% confidence intervals for key cosmological parameters, finding $\\Omega_{\\rm m} = 0.322^{+0.027}_{-0.030}$ and $\\sigma_8 = 0.735^{+0.045}_{-0.035}$ for $\\Lambda$CDM, with deviations in alternative models consistent within $1\\sigma$. For the thawing model, we consider an exponential potential with slope $\\lambda = 0.736^{+0.270}_{-0.227}$, while for the tracker and scaling-freezing models, we use inverse axion-like and double exponential potentials, respectively. Observationally, the tracker model yields $n = 5.651^{+1.625}_{-1.604}$ and $f = 0.258^{+0.149}_{-0.096}$, and the scaling-freezing model gives $\\lambda_1 = 0.405^{+0.293}_{-0.322}$ and $\\lambda_2 = 23.226^{+7.975}_{-7.258}$. The dimensionless tSZ amplitude ($\\widetilde{W}^{\\rm SZ}$) and cosmic infrared background (CIB) parameters are tightly constrained across all models, providing additional insights into astrophysical foregrounds. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of ISW--tSZ cross-correlations as a probe of dark energy dynamics, with the Thawing quintessence model yielding the lowest $\\chi^2_{\\rm min}$ among the tested scenarios, and highlight the need for future high-precision measurements to distinguish between quintessence models and $\\Lambda$CDM.",

      "abstract": "Stellar Disruption of Axion Minihalos and Consequences for Direct Axion Detection Ian DSouza Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Scenarios such as the QCD axion with the Peccei-Quinn symmetry broken after inflation predict an enhanced matter power spectrum on sub-parsec scales. These theories lead to the formation of dense dark matter structures known as minihalos, which provide insights into early Universe dynamics and have implications for direct detection experiments. We examine the mass loss of minihalos during stellar encounters, building on previous studies that derived formulas for mass loss and performed N-body simulations. We propose a new formula for the mass loss that accounts for changes in the minihalo profile after disruption by a passing star. We also investigate the mass loss for multiple stellar encounters. We demonstrate that accurately assessing the mass loss in minihalos due to multiple stellar encounters necessitates considering the alterations in the minihalo's binding energy after each encounter, as overlooking this aspect results in a substantial underestimation of the mass loss. We further extend our analysis to the Galactic environment by more accurately incorporating multiple stellar encounters and dynamical relaxation timescales, simulating minihalo orbits in the Galactic potential. Our results show stellar interactions are more destructive than previously estimated, reducing minihalo mass retention at the solar system to ~30%, compared to earlier estimates of ~60%. This enhanced loss arises from cumulative energy injections when relaxation periods between stellar encounters are accounted for. The altered minihalo mass function implies a larger fraction of axion dark matter occupies inter-minihalo space, potentially increasing the local axion density and improving haloscope detection prospects. This thesis highlights the significance of detailed modeling of stellar disruptions in shaping the axion dark matter distribution.",

We measure and detect the three-point correlation function and third-order aperture-mass statistics of intrinsic alignments (IA) for galaxies and for haloes with $M_{\\rm halo} > 10^{13}\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$ in the $(2.8\\,\\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ simulation volume of the FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulation suite. We model the third-order aperture-mass statistics and show that on large scales both the galaxy and halo samples are well described by the tree-level effective field theory (EFT) of IA across the three dark matter density-shape combinations and a wide range of triangle configurations, with the alignment amplitude consistent with that inferred from two-point statistics. We compare the full EFT to several other models: a version neglecting the velocity-shear term, the non-linear alignment model (NLA), and to a reduced EFT assuming co-evolution relations that follow from the assumption that alignment is linear in Lagrangian space. The first two models yield biased constraints on the alignment amplitude, but the reduced EFT performs remarkably well, achieving a low reduced chi-squared and minimal bias. We examine the redshift and mass dependence of the higher-order bias parameters, finding that the linear Lagrangian bias assumption is approximately satisfied across the explored halo mass and redshift ranges for both galaxies and haloes, suggesting that the galaxies broadly follow the alignment properties of their host haloes. These co-evolution relations can be valuable for photometric shear surveys, where limited constraining power on IA parameters favours models with fewer free parameters.",

Here we present observational evidence that galaxy filaments connecting pairs of galaxy clusters undergo a split infall, with opposite velocity flows toward the two clusters. Using spectroscopic galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we isolate the internal filament velocity field by subtracting its rigid-body background motion and Hubble flow, and detect this effect at greater than $5\\sigma$ significance across a wide range of cluster and filament selections. The measured velocity profile exhibits a sign reversal near the filament midpoint and a maximum infall amplitude of $\\sim30$ km/s ($\\sim20$ km/s projected onto the line-of-sight) for clusters of mass $\\sim10^{14.3}M_\\odot$, substantially lower than expected for infall from an average cosmic environment. Multiple results on density-velocity correlation, mass-dependency, and validation with simulation indicate that filaments dynamically respond to competing gravitational potentials rather than acting as passive mass transport channels. Our results establish a new observational window on quasi-linear velocity fields in the cosmic web and provide a promising probe of mass measurement, testing gravity and velocity reconstruction with upcoming wide-field spectroscopic surveys.",

With foreground avoidance, spectroscopic redshift precision is essential; photometric redshifts render cross-correlations uninformative. Notably, cross-power spectra constrain ionizing source properties, the escape fraction $f_\\mathrm{esc}$ and star formation efficiency $f_*$, which remain degenerate in auto-power (PV $>$60%). Tight constraints require either deep surveys detecting faint galaxies ($M_\\mathrm{h,min} \\sim 10^{10}\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$) with moderate foregrounds, or conservative mass limits with optimistic foreground removal (PV $<$15%). 21cm-Galaxy cross-correlations enhance morphology constraints beyond auto-power while enabling previously inaccessible source property constraints.

BFC provides a computationally efficient alternative to expensive hydrodynamical simulations for modelling baryonic effects on cosmological scales. By applying the halo mass function and halo bias, we convolve contributions from individual halos across a range of masses and redshifts to derive the large-scale structure contribution to the DM PDF. We validate our analytical predictions against consistency-check simulations and compare them with the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation across a range of redshifts up to $z = 5$, demonstrating excellent agreement. We demonstrate that our model produces consistent results when fitting gas profiles and predicting the PDF, and vice versa. We show that the BFC parameters controlling the gas profile, particularly the halo mass scale ($M_\\mathrm{c}$), mass-dependent slope ($\\mu$), and outer truncation ($\\delta$), are the primary drivers of the PDF shape. Additionally, we investigate the validity of the log-normal approximation commonly used for DM distributions, finding that it provides a sufficient description for a few hundred FRBs. Our work provides a self-consistent model that links gas density profiles to integrated DM statistics, enabling future constraints on baryonic feedback processes from FRB observations.",

We apply our pipeline to two well-studied lensed SNe Ia, Zwicky and iPTF16geu. For SN iPTF16geu, unlike previous modeling efforts, we model only the images of the lensed point source (the SN) and do not use the lensed images of the extended host-galaxy. Nevertheless, we are able to infer all of the mass parameters modeled in earlier studies, and our best-fit values, including $\\gamma$, are fully consistent with published results.

Submitted to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present an improved semi-analytical model to predict density profiles of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos and apply it to constrain the self-scattering cross section using SPARC galaxy rotation curves. Building on the isothermal Jeans approach, our model incorporates (i) velocity-dependent cross sections, (ii) an empirical treatment of core collapse, and (iii) enhanced robustness for identifying solutions. These advances allow us to fit a large sample of galaxies, including systems with baryon-dominated centers often excluded in earlier studies. We find that roughly 1/6 of galaxies admit both a core-growth and a core-collapse solution, while the rest favor a unique evolutionary state. Joint constraints across the sample reveal clear velocity dependence: the allowed parameter space forms an L-shaped degeneracy, where both nearly constant, low cross sections ($\\sigma_0\\sim2\\,{\\rm cm}^2$/g, $\\omega\\gtrsim500\\,$km/s) and strongly velocity-dependent models ($\\sigma_0\\sim100\\,{\\rm cm}^2$/g, $\\omega\\sim60\\,$km/s) are viable. Adopting the core-growth interpretation yields best-fit values $\\sigma_0\\simeq5\\,{\\rm cm}^2$/g and $\\omega\\simeq250\\,$km/s. Our constraints are remarkably consistent with previous results derived from a variety of independent probes. Compared to cold dark matter (CDM) models, SIDM outperforms simple adiabatic-contraction profiles and rivals empirical feedback-based CDM profiles, yet shows no correlation with stellar-to-halo mass ratio, a proxy for feedback strength, offering a distinct explanation for dwarf galaxy diversity. Moreover, SIDM does not affect galaxy-halo scaling relations significantly and makes concentration systematically lower. Our results highlight SIDM as a compelling framework for small-scale structure, while future low-mass kinematic data will be crucial for breaking degeneracies in velocity-dependent cross-section models.",

White, Amina Helmi, Guilhem Lavaux, Jens Jasche Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Our Galaxy, Andromeda and their companion dwarf galaxies form the Local Group. Most of the mass in and around it is believed to be dark matter rather than gas or stars, so its distribution must be inferred from the effect of gravity on the motion of visible objects. Modelling efforts have long struggled to reproduce the quiet Hubble flow around the Local Group, as they require unrealistically little mass beyond the haloes of the two main galaxies. Here we revisit this using $\\Lambda$CDM simulations of Local Group analogues with initial conditions constrained to match the observed dynamics of the two main haloes and the surrounding flow. The observations are reconcilable within $\\Lambda$CDM, but only if mass is strongly concentrated in a plane out to 10 Mpc, with the surface density rising away from the Local Group and with deep voids above and below. This configuration, dynamically inferred, mirrors known structures in the nearby galaxy distribution. The resulting Hubble flow is quiet yet strongly anisotropic, a fact obscured by the paucity of tracers at high supergalactic latitude. This flattened geometry reconciles the dynamical mass estimates of the Local Group with the surrounding velocity field, thus demonstrating full consistency within the standard cosmological model.",

In this paper, we explore approaches to increase the applicability of machine learning models for photometric redshift estimation on a broader range of galaxy types. Typical models are trained with ground-truth redshifts from spectroscopy. We test the utility and effectiveness of two approaches for combining spectroscopic redshifts and redshifts derived from multiband ($\\sim$35 filters) photometry, which sample different types of galaxies compared to spectroscopic surveys. The two approaches are (1) training on a composite dataset and (2) transfer learning from one dataset to another. We compile photometric redshifts from the COSMOS2020 catalog (TransferZ) to complement an established spectroscopic redshift dataset (GalaxiesML). We used two architectures, deterministic neural networks (NN) and Bayesian neural networks (BNN), to examine and evaluate their performance with respect to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) photo-$z$ science requirements. We also use split conformal prediction for calibrating uncertainty estimates and producing prediction intervals for the BNN and NN, respectively. We find that a NN trained on a composite dataset predicts photo-$z$'s that are 4.5 times less biased within the redshift range $0.3<z<1.5$, 1.1 times less scattered, and has a 1.4 times lower outlier rate than a model trained on only spectroscopic ground truths. We also find that BNNs produce reliable uncertainty estimates, but are sensitive to the different ground truths. This investigation leverages different sources of ground truths to develop models that can accurately predict photo-$z$'s for a broader population of galaxies crucial for surveys such as Euclid and LSST.",

To process, analyse and identify such large amounts of GW signals arising from mergers of Binary Black Holes (BBH), we need both speed and accuracy. In the search for (massive) BBH signals, the biggest hurdle is posed by the various non-gaussian noise transients called glitches. Compared to our previous work, which used a simple convolutional neural network to distinguish BBHs from Blip glitches, this work uses transfer learning with InceptionNetV3 to distinguish BBHs from six types of most popular glitches from the third observing run of LIGO. While the glitches are real and identified via GravitySpy, the BBH signals are simulated and then injected into the real detector noise for each of the two LIGO detectors. We generate Sine-Gaussian Projection (SGP) maps by cross-correlating data with Sine-Gaussian functions of varied quality factors ($Q$) and central frequencies ($f_0$) and projected on the $Q$ - $f_0$ plane. We find that SGP maps make it easier to distinguish BBHs from glitches that look very similar to BBHs in the Time-Frequency maps like the Blips, while also maintaining significant morphological differences between BBHs and the more frequent glitches - Scattered Light and Fast Scattering. Our network has an accuracy of $87%$, a TPR of 0.83 for an FPR of 0.1 on our test dataset. It is also robust, retaining its level of accuracy, when tested on real BBH events identified in the first three observing runs of LIGO. Our proposed method shows the viability of using the SGP maps and neural networks for fast identification of GW events improving the efficiency of standard search pipelines.",

Find more information on AIDA-TNG here:this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The nature of Dark Matter (DM) is one of the most outstanding mysteries of modern astrophysics. While the standard Cold DM (CDM) model successfully explains observations on most astrophysical scales, DM particles have not yet been detected, leaving room for a plethora of different models. In order to identify their observable signatures, we use the AIDA-TNG cosmological simulation suite to predict the distributions of gas and neutral hydrogen (HI) in the CDM, Self-Interacting DM (SIDM), velocity-dependent SIDM (vSIDM), and Warm DM (WDM) models. We find that the DM models investigated have very limited impact on the median gas and HI profile of haloes. In particular, for the most massive haloes ($M_{\\rm vir}\\sim10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$), we find that DM self-interactions can shallow the central potential and thereby enhance gas cooling. We find that, in all models, the halo-to-halo variation in the HI profiles is explained by AGN feedback, and that the specific characteristics of DM model is largely subdominant. Nevertheless, we detect some systematic difference in the case of SIDM, with more HI surviving close to the centre with respect to other models. We provide fitting functions for the gas and HI profiles. We investigate the galaxy-Ly$\\alpha$ cross-correlation function (\\galacc) for different halo masses, redshift and observation strategies. We find that at $z=0$ vSIDM can be distinguished from CDM in haloes with $10^{12}\\lesssim M_{\\rm vir}\\lesssim10^{13}\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$, while SIDM1 can be distinguished from CDM in haloes with $M_{\\rm vir}\\gtrsim10^{13}\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$.

Completed manuscript not yet submitted to journal. Comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We investigate how the orbital evolution and mass distribution of infalling satellite galaxies shape the phase-space and radial distributions of intracluster light (ICL) relative to the underlying cluster dark matter (DM) halo. Using N-body simulations, we follow the tidal stripping and orbital evolution of satellite galaxies as they are accreted into a live cluster halo, systematically varying satellite-to-host mass ratio and orbital circularity. We measure the specific orbital energy and angular momentum of stripped stellar and DM material, finding that the stripped stars consistently occupy lower-energy and lower-angular momentum regions of phase-space than the stripped DM. The magnitude of this difference increases strongly towards more equal satellite--to--host mass ratios, while the dependence on orbital circularity is weak. We construct a predictive model for the phase-space properties of stripped stars and DM from a whole infalling satellite population and find that the resulting phase-space difference between the components are driven primarily by the characteristic mass of the infalling satellite stellar mass function. We find that the ICL is always more centrally concentrated than the DM. The magnitude of this offset depends on the characteristic mass and increases towards higher characteristic masses. Comparisons with four independent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations show that, once the infalling satellite stellar mass function is matched, the model reproduces the radial stellar-to-DM density profile offsets to better than the inter-simulation scatter. This demonstrates that the radial relationship between the ICL and the DM distribution is largely governed by satellite demographics. With adequate constraints on the infalling satellite population, ICL density profiles can therefore be used as informative tracers of the underlying radial DM distribution in clusters.",

The modified stellar structure equations are solved using realistic relativistic mean-field (RMF) equations of state (EOSs), including density-dependent linear models and nonlinear interacting models with meson self-couplings. Theoretical predictions are confronted with multimessenger constraints from heavy pulsars, NICER radius measurements, and GW170817 tidal deformability, imposing $M_{\\max}\\simeq 2.07\\, M_{\\odot}$ and $10.62~\\mathrm{km}<R_{1.4}<12.83~\\mathrm{km}$ to constrain both the EOS parameter space and $\\lambda$. We find that density-dependent EOSs such as DDH$_\\delta$ and TW satisfy all observational constraints for specific $\\lambda$ ranges, while nonlinear EOSs (NL3, GM1, TM1), despite large maximum masses, fail to simultaneously satisfy radius and tidal bounds even in modified gravity. The maximum neutron star mass is highly sensitive to the matter--geometry coupling and exhibits a strong degeneracy with the EOS, consistent with previous studies. The additional term in the modified Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations alters the pressure gradient, affecting EOS stiffness and the speed of sound squared $c_s^2$, while preserving causality ($c_s^2/c^2<1$). Pearson and Kendall analyses reveal a strong negative correlation between mass, radius, and $\\lambda$ ($-0.18$ and $-0.23$, respectively). Our results show that modified gravity alone cannot compensate for unrealistic dense-matter physics, highlighting the necessity of realistic EOSs and joint multimessenger constraints, and establish conservative $f(R,T)$ gravity as a viable strong-field extension of General Relativity.",

Romero Version 2 was published in Physical Review D Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) The spatial curvature of the Universe remains a central question in modern cosmology. In this work, we explore the potential of localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) as a novel tool to constrain the cosmic curvature parameter $\\Omega_k$ in a cosmological model-independent way. Using a sample of 120 FRBs with known redshifts and dispersion measures, we reconstruct the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ via artificial neural networks, and use it to obtain angular-diameter distances $D_A(z)$ through two complementary approaches. First, we derive the comoving distance $D_C(z)$ and $D_A(z)$ directly from FRBs without assuming a fiducial cosmology. Then, we combine the FRB-based $H(z)$ with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) DESI DR2 measurements to infer $D_A(z)$. By comparing the FRB-derived and BAO+FRB-derived $D_A(z)$, we constrain spatial curvature. Our covariance-based likelihood (accounting for correlated uncertainties) yields $\\Omega_k = -0.31\\pm0.57$, while a diagonal (Gaussian) treatment gives $\\Omega_k = -0.13\\pm0.46$. Both estimations are consistent with spatial flatness at the $1\\sigma$ level, albeit with a mild preference for negative curvature. Explicitly accounting for the full covariance broadens the intervals and avoids underestimation of uncertainties. These results highlight the growing relevance of FRBs in precision cosmology and their synergy with BAO as a powerful, cosmological model-independent probe of the large-scale geometry of the Universe.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) In this study, we use late-time probes, such as well-localized fast radio bursts (FRBs), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), supernovae (SNe), and cosmic chronometers (CC) to constrain cosmological parameters through a model-independent cosmographic approach. By integrating FRB data with BAO from DESI DR2, SNe, and CC, we derive constraints on the Hubble constant ($H_0$), the deceleration parameter ($q_0$), and the jerk parameter ($j_0$), using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis for parameter estimation. The cosmographic approach with FRBs alone provides $H_0 = 66.35^{+4.13}_{-5.04} \\, \\text{km} \\, \\text{s}^{-1} \\, \\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.33^{+0.21}_{-0.15}$, and $j_0 = 0.83^{+0.57}_{-0.67}$, corresponding to a precision of $\\sim 6\\%$ for the Hubble constant and showing consistency with the $\\Lambda$CDM expectation.

Combining the FRB, SNe, DESI+CMB, and CC datasets further tightens the constraints to $H_0 = 68.03^{+0.53}_{-0.52} \\, \\text{km} \\, \\text{s}^{-1} \\, \\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.41 \\pm 0.02$, and $j_0 = 0.55 \\pm 0.02$, with the jerk parameter remaining lower than $j_0 = 1$ at the $1\\sigma$ confidence level. These findings hint at a possible late-time kinematic tension, as indicated by the inferred value of the jerk parameter, which is primarily driven by the DESI+CMB dataset under standard early-Universe assumptions for the sound horizon.",

This process requires an accurate lensing tracer, which can be obtained either through internal reconstruction from high-resolution CMB observations or from external large-scale structure (LSS) surveys. Ground-based large-aperture telescopes (LATs) are crucial for internal reconstruction, yet existing and planned facilities are confined to the southern hemisphere, limiting effective delensing to that region. In this work, we assess the impact of introducing a northern hemisphere LAT, assumed to be situated near AliCPT (hence termed Ali-like LAT, or LATN), on delensing performance and PGW detection, using simulations. Our baseline setup includes a space-based small-aperture mission (LiteBIRD-like, SAT) and a southern LAT (SO-like, LATS). External LSS tracers, which have been shown to play an important role in delensing before the availability of ultra-sensitive polarization data, are also considered. We find that southern-hemisphere internal delensing reduces the uncertainty in r by approximately 21% compared to the no-delensing case. Adding LATN enables full-sky internal delensing, achieving a further ~19% reduction--comparable to that from including LSS tracers (~17%). Once LATN is included, the marginal benefit of LSS tracers drops to ~10%. These results highlight the significant role of LATN in advancing delensing capabilities and improving PGW constraints.",

All v1.0 data products now available on LAMBDA at this https URL ; for details of differences compared to the previous v0.11/arXiv v2 release, see the Change Log on LAMBDA at this https URL Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present the results of a search for galaxy clusters in the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6) microwave sky maps covering 16293 square degrees in three frequency bands, using data obtained over the lifetime of the project (2008-2022). We report redshifts and mass estimates for 10040 clusters detected via their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect with signal-to-noise greater than 4 at a 2.4 arcminute filter scale. The catalog includes 1180 clusters at redshifts greater than 1, and 124 clusters at redshifts greater than 1.5. Using a relation between cluster SZ signal and mass that is consistent with recent weak-lensing measurements, we estimate that clusters detected with signal-to-noise greater than 5 form a sample which is 90% complete for clusters with masses greater than $5 \\times 10^{14}$ MSun (measured within a spherical volume with mean density 500 times the critical density). El Gordo, a cluster found in an initial ACT survey of 755 square degrees, remains the most extreme cluster in mass and redshift; we find no cluster with a mass and redshift combination high enough to falsify the standard LCDM cosmology with Gaussian initial perturbations. We make public a variety of data products, including the full cluster candidate list, noise maps, and sky masks, along with our software for cluster detection and instructions for reproducing our cluster catalogs from the public ACT maps.",

Comments are welcome. Code available at this https URL Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present the constraint on the growth rate of structure from the combination of DESI DR1 BGS sample, Fundamental Plane, and Tully-Fisher peculiar velocity catalogues using the maximum likelihood fields method. The combined catalogue contains 415,523 galaxy redshifts and 76,616 peculiar velocity measurements. To handle the large amount of data in the DESI DR1 peculiar velocity catalogue, we significantly improve the computational efficiency by rewriting the algorithm with JAX. After removing outliers and Tully-Fisher galaxies that are affected by systematics, we find $f\\sigma_8 = 0.483_{-0.043}^{+0.080}(\\mathrm{stat}) \\pm 0.018(\\mathrm{sys})$, consistent within $1\\sigma$ with the power spectrum and correlation function analysis using the same dataset. Combining all three measurements with appropriate correlations, the consensus measurement is $f\\sigma_8 (z_{\\mathrm{eff}}=0.07) = 0.450\\pm0.055$, consistent with Planck $+\\Lambda$CDM cosmology $(f\\sigma_8 = 0.449 \\pm 0.008)$. Combining with the high redshift growth rate of structure measurements from DESI ShapeFit, the constraint on the growth index is $\\gamma = 0.58\\pm0.11$, consistent with GR.",

Accepted for publication in PASJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We investigate the diversity of dark matter (DM) density profiles in a large sample of late-type galaxies from the SPARC database, with the goal of testing whether a cusp-to-core transition occurs across galaxy mass scales. We perform Bayesian fits to high-quality rotation curves using flexible halo models that allow for variations in the inner slopes of DM density profiles. We quantify the central dark matter structure using the surface density within the inner region of the halo, defined as $\\Sigma_{\\rm DM}(<0.01r_{V_{\\rm max}})$, and compare the SPARC galaxies with Milky Way dwarf satellites as well as galaxy groups and clusters. Our results reveal significant diversity in the inner density slopes of SPARC galaxies, ranging from steep cusps to shallow cores, and show that many of them lie below the cuspy profiles predicted by the cold dark matter model, consistent with core-like structures. In contrast, both lower-mass dwarf galaxies and higher-mass galaxy clusters tend to follow the cuspy DM halos. These findings suggest that baryonic feedback may induce a cusp-to-core transition in Milky Way-mass galaxies, as predicted by hydrodynamical simulations. However, observational limitations and modeling uncertainties still prevent a definitive conclusion. This study provides new empirical insights into the halo mass-dependent nature of DM inner structures and the role of baryonic processes in shaping them.",

P. 134-148 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The environmental density of galaxies within the cosmic web constrains their 3D locations in filaments, voids, groups, and clusters. It traces the distribution of baryons and the influence of dark-matter halos on galaxy evolution, and helps diagnose external processes such as supernova and AGN feedback, tidal interactions, ram-pressure stripping, and large-scale flows. We focus on isolated barred galaxies, the parent population that includes Milky Way analogs. To measure local environmental density and verify isolation (|Delta v| <= 500 km s^-1), we built a Python pipeline that works in two redshift regimes: low (z0 < 0.02) and high (z0 >= 0.02). Densities were estimated with k-nearest neighbors and Voronoi tessellations and classified as void (Sigma < 0.05), filament (0.05 <= Sigma < 0.5), group (0.5 <= Sigma < 2.0), and cluster (Sigma >= 2.0). Our northern-sky sample contains 311 isolated barred galaxies from 2MIG plus Milky Way analog systems (z < 0.07). We find 157 void, 84 filament, 27 group, and 11 cluster galaxies; 30 have no detected neighbors. Sixty-seven lie in extremely low-density regions (Sigma_3D < 0.01 gal Mpc^-3), and 22 have the nearest companion beyond 5 Mpc, indicating residence in extended voids. The Milky Way (Sigma_5NN ~ 0.13 gal Mpc^-3, R ~ 2.1 Mpc) and its close analog NGC 3521 both lie in filamentary environments at the edge of a nearby void. For z > 0.02 we identify three additional Milky Way analog candidates from the density metrics: CGCG 208-043 (3D Voronoi) and NGC 5231 and CGCG 047-026 (5th-nearest neighbor). These results show that local environmental density is an effective, physically motivated criterion for selecting Milky Way analogs.",

Ho Accepted in the Astrophysical Journal (APJ) on 23-Jan-2026 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Individual radio pulses from a pulsar are directly linked to the underlying emission processes and the associated magnetic field geometry within its magnetosphere. Thus, single-pulse studies across frequencies can provide crucial insights into the physics of radio emission. Multiple studies have investigated single-pulse correlations in PSR B0329+54 with widely separated discrete frequencies, reporting the broadband nature of pulsar emission. However, understanding the frequency evolution of these correlations has been limited by poor frequency sampling, and the physical origin of these correlations remains unexplored. We present a detailed study of single-pulse correlations in PSR B0329+54 at low radio frequencies using the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), with well-sampled time series spanning 300-1460 MHz. We derived an inverted flux spectrum for this pulsar, with a turnover near 470 MHz. We used flux-calibrated and scintillation-corrected single pulses to study correlations across frequencies. Our results show that maximum correlations consistently occur near the longitude of the central component, with correlation strength exceeding 69\\% for all frequency combinations, while outer components exhibit correlations above 46\\%. These findings indicate very strong inter-frequency correlations, with no anticorrelations detected. No cross-component correlations were observed; only corresponding components correlate across frequencies. The longitudes of maximum correlation do not coincide with the intensity peaks of the average profile. We also examine how correlations vary with frequency at selected fiducial longitudes. The observations reported in this work favor curvature radiation from relativistic charge bunches in the pulsar plasma; however, reproducing the correlation curves along with spectra remains an open challenge.",

However, the dominant radiation process contributing to the $\\gamma$-ray emission is not well constrained. In the present work, we develop a model of CR acceleration at the termination shock in the superbubble inflated by the interaction of the cluster wind from the Wd 1 with the surrounding interstellar medium. We then calculate the flux and radial profile of $\\gamma$ rays produced by the inelastic collisions of the hadronic CRs with the ambient gas. Our results with reasonable parameters can explain well the spectrum and radial profile of the $\\gamma$-ray emission of HESS J1646-458, and consequently the $\\gamma$-ray emission of HESS J1646-458 is likely to be of hadronic origin.",

These features provide new constraints on supernova (SN) explosion physics and ejecta-circumstellar medium (CSM) interactions. We present high-resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a neutrino-driven SN explosion tailored to Cas A, following the system from core collapse to an age of $\\sim 1000$ yr. The models include key physical processes such as hydrodynamic instabilities, Ni-bubble effects, radiative cooling, non-equilibrium ionization, and electron-ion temperature equilibration. Our results show that the filamentary ejecta network naturally forms during the early explosion due to the interaction of neutrino-driven bubbles and instabilities, retaining a memory of the initial conditions before being progressively modified by the reverse shock. The GM morphology is reproduced by the interaction of dense ejecta clumps with an asymmetric, forward-shocked CSM shell, with radiative cooling enhancing fragmentation and generating the observed holes and rings. Overall, our study demonstrates that Cas A's complex morphology reflects both the imprint of the explosion mechanism and subsequent ejecta-CSM interactions.",

Draghis, Ken Ebisawa, Natalie Hell, Timothy R. Kallman, Richard L. Kelley, Pragati Pradhan, Shinya Yamada, Toshiyuki Azuma, Xiao-Min Tong High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The Fe K$\\alpha$ fluorescence line at 6.4 keV is a powerful probe of cold matter surrounding X-ray sources and has been widely used in various astrophysical contexts. The X-ray microcalorimeter spectrometer onboard XRISM can measure line shifts with unprecedented precision of $\\sim$0.2 eV, equivalent to a line-of-sight velocity of $\\sim$10 km s$^{-1}$. At this level of accuracy, however, several factors that influence the line energy must be carefully considered prior to astrophysical interpretation. One such important factor is the ionization degree, Fe$^{q+}$. The K$\\alpha$ line shifts redward by $\\sim$4 eV as $q$ increases from 0 (neutral) to 8 (Ar-like). Additionally, the accompanying Fe K$\\beta$ line at 7.06 keV shifts blueward by $\\sim$30 eV from $q=0$ to 8. We demonstrate that this effect is actually observable in the XRISM data of the high-mass X-ray binary Centaurus X-3 (Cen X-3). We advocate that the differential energy shift between the K$\\alpha$ and K$\\beta$ line provides a robust estimate of $q$ by decoupling from other effects that shift the two lines in the same direction. We derived $q \\sim 5$ (Sc-like) for the fluorescing matter by comparing the observation with atomic structure calculations of our own and in the literature. By accounting for the derived charge state and the corresponding shift in the rest-frame line energy, we made corrections for this effect and reached a consistent residual shift among the K$\\alpha$, K$\\beta$, and the optical measurement attributable to the systemic velocity of the system. Consequently, we obtained a new constraint on the location of the cold matter. This ionization effect needs to be assessed in all use cases of the Fe K$\\alpha$ line shift beyond Cen X-3, and the proposed metric is generally applicable to all of them.",

The latest experimental observations of the PeV total spectrum, composition energy spectrum, and anisotropy-particularly the precise measurements of the proton spectrum by the LHAASO experiment-have provided crucial breakthroughs in uncovering its origin. Based on the latest LHAASO measurements of the proton energy spectrum, combined with cosmic-ray spectral and anisotropy data, this study proposes that the spectral index variation in the knee region arises from changes in the propagation coefficient. By introducing a knee position $\\rm \\mathcal{R}_{knee}$ and an index variation $\\rm \\delta_{knee}$, we construct a rigidity-dependent double-power-law diffusion model to reproduce the knee-region spectral structure. Through modifications to the diffusion coefficient, we successfully replicate the observed knee-region spectral structure in the LHAASO proton spectrum and calculate the corresponding anisotropy. Under current data and model dependencies, a joint analysis of the energy spectrum and anisotropy does not support the propagation origin model of the cosmic-ray knee at a 95\\% confidence level. We hope that future LHAASO experiments will provide precise measurements of the energy spectra and anisotropies of various nuclei in the knee region, thereby offering a definitive test of the propagation model as the origin mechanism of the knee-region spectral structure.",

While recent studies suggest that magnetic reconnection governs the evolution of such systems, a comprehensive understanding has been lacking. Here we test a reconnection-mediated model for decaying magnetic turbulence in two-dimensional (strict-2D), 2.5D, and three-dimensional (3D) systems with both helical and nonhelical initial conditions. We show that the magnetic-energy decay timescale scales with the Lundquist number in a manner consistent with Sweet-Parker-type reconnection rather than Alfvenic or purely resistive timescales. We develop a broken power-law model for the magnetic energy spectra and provide analytic predictions for the temporal evolution of energy across both sub-inertial and inertial ranges, which are confirmed by high-resolution simulations. In nonhelical turbulence, these results favor anastrophy as the dominant constraint over helicity fluctuations. Using Minkowski functionals to analyze reconnecting current sheets in real space, we find that the structures controlling the decay are substantially smaller than the global magnetic correlation scale, implying local Lundquist numbers well below the system-scale value. This explains the weak sensitivity of global decay laws to current-sheet resolution and that the current-sheet aspect ratios converge toward Sweet-Parker predictions only at sufficiently high resolution. Together, these results establish magnetic reconnection as the organizing principle underlying inverse transfer, spectral evolution, and decay in magnetically dominated turbulence, providing a unified picture applicable across dimensionality and helicity regimes with direct implications for astrophysical plasmas.",

Using high-angular-resolution $^{12}$CO($J$ = 1-0) data from the Nobeyama 45-m telescope and HI data from the VLA, we investigated the spatial and kinematic properties of molecular and atomic gas that interact with the SNRs. We identified associated clouds in the velocity ranges of +50-+80 km s$^{-1}$ for W41 and +76-+110 km s$^{-1}$ for G22.7-0.2. Column density analysis indicates that target protons are dominated by molecular hydrogen, while atomic hydrogen contributes less than $\\sim$10-15% even after correction for self-absorption. The mean proton densities are $\\sim$1.2$\\times$10$^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$ for W41 and $\\sim$5.3$\\times$10$^{2}$ cm$^{-3}$ for G22.7-0.2.

Philip, Rohan Pattnaik, Shreya Watwe 11 pages, 7 figures, Submitted to ApJ (under review) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We perform the classification of black hole and neutron star X-ray binary systems using deep neural networks applied to archival RXTE X-ray spectral data. We first construct two neural network models: one trained using only spectral flux values and another trained using both fluxes and their associated errors. Both models achieve high classification accuracies of ~90-94 %. To gain physical interpretability of these networks, we fit all spectra with a simple phenomenological model consisting of a thermal disk component and a power-law. From this analysis, we identify the blackbody temperature, power-law index, the ratio of blackbody to power-law flux, the reduced $\\chi^2$, and the variance of the data as key parameters that likely contribute to the classification. We validate this inference by designing an additional neural network trained exclusively on this reduced parameter set, without using the spectral data directly. This parameter-based model achieves a classification accuracy comparable to that of the spectral models. Our results show that deep neural networks can not only classify compact objects in X-ray binaries with high accuracy but can also be interpreted in terms of physically meaningful spectral parameters derived from conventional X-ray spectral analysis. This framework offers a promising, mission-agnostic approach for compact object classification in current and future X-ray surveys.",

Submitted for publication in MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We investigate the role of resolution and initial magnetic field strength on core-collapse supernovae in simulations of a non-rotating $13 \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ progenitor. Specifically, we study the effect on shock revival, explosion dynamics, and the properties of the compact remnant. We run four models with different numerical grid resolutions with an initial central dipole field strength of $\\mathord{\\approx}10^{12}\\, \\mathrm{G}$. Two of those resolutions are also run with a weaker central magnetic field of $\\mathord{\\approx}10^{10}\\, \\mathrm{G}$ . The shock revival time for all models is largely independent of resolution and initial magnetic field strength, but we find higher explosion energies when the initial magnetism is stronger and at higher resolutions. We find that models with strong magnetic fields have lower neutrino luminosity and energies, due to a proto-neutron star (PNS) that is deformed by the strong magnetic fields. At higher resolutions, magnetic fields are amplified more efficiently in the gain region and in the PNS via the small-scale dynamo. Although the strong magnetic fields do not directly drive the explosion, they have a subsidiary impact on the explosion mechanism and compensate for the reduced neutrino heating. Stronger magnetic energies in the PNS also affect energy and angular momentum redistribution, leading to more extended and vigorous PNS convection zones at higher resolutions.",

      "abstract": "Exploring the role of accretion shocks in galaxy clusters as sources of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays A.D. Supanitsky, S.E. Nuza Accepted for publication in PRD High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Recently, the Pierre Auger Observatory has found strong evidence supporting the extragalactic origin of the most energetic cosmic rays. Despite several observed excesses in the distribution of arrival directions for the highest energy cosmic rays, the sources remain unidentified. Accretion shocks in galaxy clusters have been proposed as potential sources in the past. These immense shock waves, which can have radii on the order of megaparsecs, are generated by the infall of material from the intergalactic medium into the gravitational potential wells of galaxy clusters. In this work, we investigate the possibility that ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays are accelerated in these regions. Nearby massive galaxy clusters, including Virgo, are treated as a discrete component of the cluster mass distribution. Less massive galaxy clusters, as well as distant massive ones, are assumed to follow a continuous distribution in agreement with cluster mass statistics. We fit the flux at Earth and the composition profile measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory, assuming the injection of different nuclear species by these sources, to determine the values of the model parameters. Our results indicate that cosmic ray acceleration in cluster accretion shocks may account for at least a fraction of the observed UHECR flux at energies below the suppression scale. At higher energies, direct acceleration from the thermal pool would be feasible only if local fluctuations create favorable conditions, such as magnetic fields about an order of magnitude stronger than those typically expected in cluster accretion shocks, or for particular shock normal-magnetic field configurations.",

While effective for simple models and speedy spectral fitting, these local optimizers are prone to becoming trapped in local minima, particularly in high-dimensional or degenerate parameter spaces, and typically require extensive user intervention. In this work, we introduce XFit, a global optimization method for fitting X-ray data, which makes extensive use of the Ferret evolutionary algorithm. XFit enables automated exploration of complex parameter spaces, efficient mapping of confidence intervals, and identification of degenerate solutions that may be overlooked by local methods. We demonstrate the performance of XFit using two representative X-ray sources: the Central Compact Object in Cassiopeia A and the supernova remnant G41.1-0.3. These examples span both low- and high-dimensional models, allowing us to illustrate the advantages of global optimization. In both cases, XFit produces solutions that are consistent with or improve upon those found with traditional methods, while also revealing alternative fits or degenerate solutions within statistically acceptable confidence levels. The automated mapping of parameter space offered by XFit makes it a powerful complement to existing spectral fitting tools, particularly as models and data quality become increasingly complex. Future work will expand the application of XFit to broader datasets and more physically motivated models.",

Using follow-up high-resolution VLBI observations and archival data, we investigate the morphology and the variations in orientation and core flux density of the 3C 66A jet to gain a deeper insights into its kinematic behavior and physical origins. We performed KVN and VERA array (KaVA) observations at 22/43 GHz over three epochs in 2014 and collected 109 sets of Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) archival data at 43 GHz between 1996 - 2025. We imaged the parsec-scale jet and parameterized it using circular Gaussian fittings to the UV visibilities. Finally, we derived the inner jet PA and the core flux densities for the VLBA data. The jet presents a twisted morphology in the KaVA maps. The PA of the fitted Gaussian components is in the range between 170 deg and 195 deg. Our kinematic analysis using the VLBA data indicates that the PA oscillates with an amplitude of 7.77 pm 0.79 deg and a period of 10.94 pm 0.22 years, presented for the first time in this work. This oscillation is topped by a continuous clockwise shift of the PA by -0.83 pm 0.07 deg/year. We also identified a strong core flux variability with possible periodicity and a 2 sigma correlation between the core flux density and the inner jet PA change. We discuss possible physical models that could explain the observed features for this object; in particular, a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) system, Lense Thirring (LT) effect, and jet or disk instabilities. The oscillation and continuous shift of the PA and the possible radio flux periodicity, together with the optical flux periodicity of approximately 2 years that had previously been confirmed in several independent studies, favor a jet precession scenario driven by orbital motion and disk-orbit misalignment in a SMBHB system.",

Comments welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Bow-shock pulsar wind nebulae are valuable sources to investigate the dynamics of relativistic pulsar winds and the mechanisms by which they are converted into cosmic-ray leptons at the highest energies. The Lighthouse Nebula is one such object, famous for the high velocity of its pulsar and a long misaligned X-ray jet that is understood as a specific escape channel for the most energetic particles. We aim to get a better understanding of how the bulk of non-thermal particles are released into the interstellar medium. We focus on GHz radio observations, which probe lower-energy particles that are dominant in number and long-lived, thus offering a picture of how escape proceeds in the long run. We analyze 10.5h of MeerKAT observations in the 0.9-1.7GHz band. MeerKAT observations reveal a highly structured synchrotron nebula downstream of pulsar PSR J1101-6101. A cometary tail is detected up to beyond 5pc from the pulsar, while a system of multiple transverse two-sided emission streaks is observed for the first time. No radio counterpart of the misaligned X-ray jet is seen. The radio streaks are interpreted as the occasional charge-independent release of energetic leptons from the tail into the surrounding medium, as a result of dynamical instabilities and reconfiguration in the downstream flow. The intensity layout suggests that most of the particle content of the nebula is discharged into the ambient medium within several parsec. Once escaped, particles light up the ambient magnetic field, which appears to have a coherence length of at least a few parsec. The length and persistence of the streaks indicate a low level of magnetic turbulence, possibly slightly enhanced with respect to average cosmic-ray transport conditions in the Galaxy. Such a confinement may result from self-generated turbulence by resonant streaming instability, or be due to past activity of the progenitor star.",

To be published in the Proceedings of Science this https URL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Black holes are the simplest possible objects, characterised by only mass and spin. We see them via accretion, so there is one more fundamental parameter which is the mass accretion rate. Here I will review how the data from both stellar and supermassive black holes can be fit into a framework where there is a major spectral transition at $\\dot{m}=L/L_{\\rm Edd}\\sim 0.01$ where the optically thick disc is replaced by a hot flow. This dramatic spectral change also affects the expected properties of thermal and radiatively powered winds, matching the overall properties of winds seen in new XRISM data from the stellar mass binaries, though there can also be additional UV and dust driven winds in supermassive black holes. The radio data in stellar and supermassive black holes are clear that the hot flow (not the disc) connects to the radio jet, and the radio-X-ray 'fundamental plane' can be qualitatively understood if the radio quiet AGN and stellar mass black holes have low to moderate spins, with the jet power set as a constant fraction of the accretion power. A small fraction of AGN (radio loud) instead have much higher (factor $100-1000\\times$) radio-to-X-ray ratio at the same black hole mass and mass accretion rates. I speculate that these have higher jet power due to high black hole spin. I review the multiple issues still remaining in this picture, most of which are connected to the geometry and nature of the X-ray corona, and the conflicting constraints on this which come from reflection spectroscopy and polarimetry.",

      "abstract": "Closure models for the feedback of energetic particles on plasma turbulence J. Pratt High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) Energetic particles interact with the plasma surrounding them, resonating with certain plasma waves to stabilize them while destabilizing others, and changing the character of the background turbulence in ways that have not been fully quantified or understood. Interaction with the turbulent background plasma is key to the acceleration of many types of energetic particles including high-energy cosmic rays, solar energetic particles, and pick-up ions. This is a process that would ideally be described by a kinetic model, a type of model that follows a probability distribution function (PDF) for all particles in 7-dimensional space. Because of the high dimensionality of a kinetic model, such simulations use the largest computational resources available, and are yet unable to simulate a realistic number of particles, reach the large scales necessary for astrophysical problems, or use high-precision numerical methods. Two available alternatives to kinetic plasma models have been explored: a multi-fluid model, and a hybrid fluid/Fokker-Planck model. These methods are hampered by the physical modeling of the coupling. We develop a new model, which follows the PDF for all particles; this can be viewed as a step toward physical realism above a multi-fluid MHD model, while also being more computationally efficient than a kinetic model. The equations we develop model both the background plasma and the energetic particles self-consistently. Over the last decade, similar PDF methods have been developed to a high level of sophistication to model reactive flows and turbulent combustion for engineering applications. For treatment of the feedback of the energetic particles on a background plasma, a PDF closure approach should evaluate the mean characteristics, including the density, with better statistical quality than will particle-sampling procedures.",

Rodríguez, Andreas Reisenegger, Denis González-Caniulef, Cristóbal Petrovich High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The detection of likely thermal ultraviolet emission from a few old neutron stars suggests that at least one internal heating mechanism is present in these stars. One proposed mechanism is rotochemical heating, in which the continuous contraction of the neutron star due to its spin-down produces chemical imbalances that induce Urca reactions, and the latter deposit heat in the neutron star core. If the protons in the star are superconducting, their energy gap suppresses the reactions, except in microscopic magnetized regions (such as quantized flux tubes) in which the protons act as if they were normal. Therefore, the strength of the internal magnetic field controls the rate at which reactions proceed and thus affects the thermal evolution of the neutron star. Here, we present the first comprehensive study of the effect of an internal magnetic field in the superconducting interior on rotochemical heating. We simulate the evolution of neutron stars for different internal magnetic field strengths and neutron energy gaps, comparing the results to Hubble Space Telescope observations of old neutron stars. All the observational data can be accounted for if the proton energy gap is large ($\\sim 1.5\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$) and the neutron energy gap is small ($\\lesssim 0.1\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$) or vanishing, while the millisecond pulsar PSR~J0437$-$4715 needs to have a very weak internal magnetic field. Our results suggest that neutron-star cores are characterized by a large proton pairing gap and a small or vanishing neutron gap, and that millisecond pulsars have very weak internal magnetic fields. Under these conditions, rotochemical heating alone can account for the observed thermal emission of old neutron stars.",

Published in JCAP Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Primordial black holes (PBHs) can be produced in the very early Universe due to the large density fluctuations. The cosmic background of axion-like particles (ALPs) could be non-thermally generated by PBHs. In this paper, we investigate the ALPs emitted by ultra-light PBHs with the mass range $10 \\, {\\rm g} \\lesssim M_{\\rm PBH} \\lesssim 10^9 \\, \\rm g$, in which PBHs would have completely evaporated before the start of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and can therefore not be directly constrained. In this case, the minimal scenario that ALPs could interact only with photons is supposed. We study the stochastic oscillations between the ALPs and photons in the cosmic magnetic field in detail. The primordial magnetic field (PMF) can be modelled as the stochastic background field model with the completely non-homogeneous component of the cosmic plasma. Using the latest stringent limits on PMF, we show the numerical results of ALP-photon oscillation probability distributions with the homogeneous and stochastic magnetic field scenarios. The PBH-induced stochastic ALP-photon oscillations in the PMF may have the effects on some further phenomena, such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the cosmic X-ray background (CXB), and the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB).",

Accepted in Scientific Reports Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) Astrophysical radio sources are embedded in turbulent magnetised environments. In the 1 MHz sky, solar radio bursts are the brightest sources, produced by electrons travelling along magnetic field lines from the Sun through the heliosphere. We demonstrate that the magnetic field not only guides the emitting electrons, but also directs radio waves via anisotropic scattering from density irregularities in the magnetised plasma. Using multi-vantage-point type III solar radio burst observations and anisotropic radio wave propagation simulations, we show that the interplanetary field structure is encoded in the observed radio emission directivity, and that large-scale turbulent channelling of radio waves is present over large distances, even for relatively weak anisotropy in the embedded density fluctuations. Tracing the radio emission at many frequencies (distances), the effects of anisotropic scattering can be disentangled from the electron motion along the interplanetary magnetic field, and the emission source locations are unveiled. Our analysis suggests that magnetic field structures within turbulent media could be reconstructed using radio observations and is found consistent with the Parker field, offering a novel method for remotely diagnosing the large-scale field structure in the heliosphere and other astrophysical plasmas.",

Mogawana, A. van Dyk Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We report on optical spectroscopic and photometric follow-up observations of the eROSITA discovered transient SRGt 062340.2-265751 and show that it displays the characteristics of a nova-like cataclysmic variable (CV), with possible indications of being a magnetic system. We try to put better constraints on the classification of SRGt 062340.2-265751 using optical time-resolved spectroscopic and photometric observations to find any periodicities in the system. From these periodicities we can classify the CV sub-type that it belongs to. Spectroscopic observations revealed a very low amplitude, K $\\sim$ 14 km s$^{-1}$, in the radial velocity of the H$\\beta$ and H$\\gamma$ emission lines, suggesting that the system is likely observed at a low inclination angle. High-speed photometric observations revealed highly stochastic variability, characteristic of many magnetic cataclysmic variable systems. A probable 3.645 $\\pm$ 0.006 hour orbital period was found by applying Lomb-Scargle period analysis to the H$\\beta$ and H$\\gamma$ emission line radial velocities. A 24.905 $\\pm$ 0.065 min period was found from photometric observations, which we associate with the white dwarf spin. However, it was also found that the photometry revealed multiple periodicities from night to night. TESS observations in three sectors did not reveal any of the periodicities found from ground-based observations, but did show a prominent period in only one sector, which might be attributed to a positive superhump period. These multiple periodicities as well as the HeII $\\lambda$4686 and Bowen blend emission lines seen in the spectra indicate that SRGt 062340.2-265751 is likely a nova-like CV, and might belong to the VY Scl sub-type.",

The need for accurate atomic data has arose as we attempt detailed analysis of the high-resolution spectra they provide. This is because current spectral models, which heavily rely on theoretical calculations, entail non-negligible uncertainties. We employ a plasma spectroscopy device called electron beam ion trap (EBIT) to experimentally obtain precise atomic data. An EBIT with a design that allows combined operation with synchrotron radiation facilities was developed based on the Heidelberg Compact EBIT and installed at ISAS/JAXA for this purpose. We conducted a spectroscopic experiment using the JAXA-EBIT at the synchrotron radiation facility SPring-8, and successfully obtained high-resolution spectra of the L$\\alpha$ resonance transition of Ne-like Fe$^{16+}$ ions, 3C, as well as the K$\\alpha$ resonance transition of He-like O$^{6+}$ ions. We also measured another Ne-like Fe$^{16+}$ L$\\alpha$ resonance transition, 3G, and constrained an upper limit of the oscillator strength ratio of 3G to 3C, using our experimental results. The experimental values obtained in this study will be applied to observational studies of astrophysical objects as a part of the plasma spectral modeling.",

We here study the evolving phase of the GW waveform derived from a large set of simulations of BBH mergers forming in dense stellar clusters through binary-single interactions. We uncover that a well-defined fraction of the assembled eccentric GW sources will have a notable GW phase shift induced by the remaining third object. The magnitude of the GW phase shift often exceeds conservative analytical estimates due to strong 3-body interactions, which occasionally results in GW sources with clearly shifted and perturbed GW waveforms. This opens up promising opportunities for current and future GW detectors, as observing such a phase shift can identify the formation environment of a BBH, as well as help to characterise the local properties of its surrounding environment.",

One of the popular models, the star-disk collision model, suggests that QPEs can be produced through periodic collisions of an orbiting star with the accretion disk of a central black hole (BH). However, previous tests of the star-disk collision model mainly focus on the timing analysis. Other observed properties, such as peak luminosities $L_{\\rm{p}}$, durations $t_{\\rm{e}}$, and radiation temperatures $T_{\\rm{p}}$ of the eruptions, are not systematically investigated. For a sample of six QPE sources and two QPE-like sources, we test the shock-cooling emission model from star-disk collisions by using these observables to derive the constraints on the stellar radius $R_\\star$. We find that, except for two sources (eRO-QPE3 and eRO-QPE4), the rest of the sample either has no allowed $R_\\star$ to simultaneously reproduce the observed $L_{\\rm{p}}$ and $t_{\\rm{e}}$, or the required $R_\\star$ is too large to avoid being disrupted by the central BH.

The emission spanning several tens of parsecs suggests an efficient confinement of the ultra-relativistic lepton pairs produced by pulsars in their vicinity. The physical mechanism responsible for this suppressed transport has not yet been identified. In some scenarios, pair confinement may be linked to the medium the pulsars are located in. We aim at understanding the type of medium pulsars probe over their lifetime. We developed a model for the environment probed by moving pulsars, from their birth in core-collapse explosions - where they receive a natal kick - until their entry into the interstellar medium. The model involves: (i) a Monte-Carlo sampling of the properties of the massive-star progenitors of pulsars; (ii) a calculation of the structure of the surrounding medium shaped by these progenitors for the two cases of isolated stars and star clusters; and (iii) a computation of the evolution of supernova remnants in these parent environments. Ultimately, from a distribution of neutron star kick velocities, we assess the medium in which pulsars are located as a function of time. We first derived the statistical properties of a fully synthetic Galactic population and then applied the model to a selection of known pulsars to assess the likely nature of their environment. We show that pulsars escape into the interstellar medium at around 300 kyr, significantly later than assumed in the literature. Given our assumptions, all known pulsars with a confirmed TeV halo have high probabilities of still being in their parent environment, which suggests that efficient pair confinement is connected to the region influenced by progenitor stars. To test this, we provide the probability that known pulsars still reside in their parent environment for a list of known pulsars.",

Besides the widely studied $s$, $i$, and $r$ processes in moderately-to-strongly neutron-rich environments, an intriguing alternative site for lanthanide production could in fact be robustly $\\textit{proton-rich}$ matter outflows from core-collapse supernovae under specific conditions -- in particular, high-entropy winds with enhanced neutrino luminosity and fast dynamical timescales. In this environment, excess protons present after charged particle reactions have ceased can continue to be converted to neutrons by (anti-)neutrino interactions, producing a neutron capture reaction flow up to A~200. This scenario, christened the $\\nu i$ process in a recent paper, has previously been discussed as a possibility. Here, we examine the prospects for $\\nu i$ process through the lens of stellar abundance patterns, bolometric lightcurves, and galactic chemical evolution models, with a particular focus on hypernovae as candidate sites. We identify specific lanthanide signatures for which the $\\nu i$ process can provide a credible alternative to $r$/$i$ processes.",

Previous kinetic studies by particle-in-cell simulations have demonstrated that when maximum CR energy is near the injection scale, NRH instability efficiently amplifies magnetic field up to the saturation level. However, the efficiency of NRH instability goes down as maximum energy increase since CR current is carried by escaping CRs near the maximum energy. We employ a one-dimensional MHD--CR framework solving telegraph-type diffusion--convection equations to trace the coupled evolution of CRs, magnetic fields, and shock dynamics under realistic parameters. We find a distinct transition with magnetic field strength: for weak background fields ($B_{0}\\!\\lesssim\\!10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{G}$), NRH instability efficiently amplifies upstream turbulence, driving a self-regulated state where $E_{\\max}$ becomes independent of initial strength of magnetic turbulence. In contrast, for stronger background fields ($B_{0}\\!\\gtrsim\\!10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{G}$), the escaping CR current is too weak to drive NRH instability, and magnetic turbulence further decays through parametric instabilities, potentially reducing the acceleration efficiency. We give the physical interpretation for the transition and discuss conditions for PeV--EeV acceleration at UFO reverse shocks.",

We complement these observations with data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and the Einstein Probe, as well as radio observations from the Very Large Array. GRB 250221A is among the few short GRBs with direct afterglow spectroscopy, which gives a secure redshift determination of $z=0.768$ and allows the unambiguous identification of the host as a galaxy with a star-formation rate of $\\sim3\\,M_\\odot\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$. The X-ray and optical light curves up to $T_0+3\\times 10^4$ s (where $T_0$ refers to the GRB trigger time) are well described by forward-shock synchrotron emission in the slow-cooling regime within the standard fireball framework. However, at $T_0 \\sim 5\\times 10^4$ s, both the X-ray and optical bands exhibit an excess over the same interval, which we interpret as evidence of energy injection into a jet with a half-opening angle of $\\theta_j=11.5^{\\circ}$ through a refreshed shock powered by late central engine activity or a radially stratified ejecta. The burst properties (duration, spectral hardness, peak energy, and location in the Amati plane) all favour a compact binary merger origin. However, our modelling of the afterglow suggests a dense circumburst medium ($n\\sim80$ cm$^{-3}$), which is more typical of a collapsar environment.",

Samanta, S. Iyyani High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The minimum variability timescale (MVT) is a key observable used to probe the central engines of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) by constraining the emission region size and the outflow Lorentz factor. However, its interpretation is often ambiguous: statistical noise and analysis choices can bias measurements, making it difficult to distinguish genuine source variability from artifacts. Here we perform a comprehensive suite of simulations to establish a quantitative framework for validating Haar-based MVT measurements. We show that in multi--component light curves, the MVT returns the most statistically significant structure in the interval, which is not necessarily the fastest intrinsic timescale, and can therefore converge to intermediate values. Reliability is found to depend jointly on the MVT value and its signal-to-noise ratio ($\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{MVT}}$), with shorter intrinsic timescales requiring proportionally higher $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{MVT}}$ to be resolved. We use this relation to define an empirical MVT Validation Curve, and provide a practical workflow to classify measurements as robust detections or upper limits. Applying this procedure to a sample of Fermi-GBM bursts shows that several published MVT values are better interpreted as upper limits. These results provide a path toward standardizing MVT analyses and highlight the caution required when inferring physical constraints from a single MVT measurement in complex events.",

Accepted for publication in Nature Communications High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star crosses the tidal radius of a black hole (BH) and is ripped apart, providing a powerful way to probe dormant BHs over a wide mass range. In this study, we present our late-time observations and comprehensive multi-wavelength analyses of AT2018cqh, a TDE at the center of a dwarf galaxy that exhibited successive flares in the optical, X-ray, and radio bands. We discovered an unexpected high-state X-ray plateau phase following the peak until the present time. Along with its reported prolonged rise lasting at least 550 days, these unique characteristics are consistent with the scenario of a TDE caused by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) with a mass of approximately $(1-6) \\times 10^5$ solar masses. Furthermore, scaling relations derived from the host-galaxy properties indicated a similar BH mass in concert. This discovery highlights the invaluable role of TDEs in the search for elusive IMBHs.",

Corrected author metadata, updated affiliations and fixed a typo in figure legend High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph) Subatomic particles can interact with target nuclei in matter or decay in flight, and an individual high-energy particle can induce a particle shower composed of numerous, lower-energy secondaries. These particle showers broadly exhibit universality across diverse media, including air, water, ice, and other materials, with their development governed by the Standard Model. Full Monte Carlo simulation of particle showers, where each secondary is individually tracked and propagated, can be a computational challenge to perform at scale. Experiments thus resort to parametrized approximations when efficient simulation becomes necessary. Here, we construct distributions of parameters capable of describing the Cherenkov light yield from particle showers in ice, and extensible to other, similar media. Sampling from the distributions allows for a much improved description of event-to-event fluctuations, in amplitude and shape, along the shower axis. Including these effects is essential for a more accurate simulation of signal and background events in current and next-generation neutrino telescopes.",

Farrag High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The discovery of joint sources of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves has been a primary target for the LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and IceCube observatories. The joint detection of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves would provide insight into cosmic processes, from the dynamics of compact object mergers and stellar collapses to the mechanisms driving relativistic outflows. The joint detection of multiple cosmic messengers can also elevate the significance of the common observation even when some or all of the constituent messengers are sub-threshold, i.e. not significant enough to declare their detection individually. Using data from the LIGO, Virgo, and IceCube observatories, including sub-threshold events, we searched for common sources of gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos during the third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Our search did not identify significant joint sources. We derive constraints on the rate densities of joint sources. Our results constrain the isotropic neutrino emission from gravitational-wave sources for very high values of the total energy emitted in neutrinos (> $10^{52} - 10^{54}$ erg).",

However, the origin of rTDEs remains unclear. In addition, no statistical research on rTDEs with time intervals $>5$ years has been made yet. In this work, we searched for rTDEs with time intervals of 5--19 years using CRTS data in a sample of 16 ZTF BTS TDEs at $z<0.05$. We found 2 rTDE candidates, AT 2019azh and AT 2024pvu, with time intervals of 13.2 and 17.1 years, respectively. The peak luminosities of CRTS flares are close to those of ZTF flares. For the CRTS flare of AT 2024pvu, using GALEX UV observations near the peak, we measured a blackbody temperature of $\\sim19500$ K, consistent with TDEs and higher than SNe. Moreover, we estimated the expected number of SNe in the sample to be $\\lesssim0.08$, and hence the probability that both CRTS flares are SNe is only 0.3\\%. Therefore, the possibility that both CRTS flares are SNe can be ruled out, and it is likely that both are TDEs. Using the two rTDEs, we inferred that the TDE rate is 2--3 orders of magnitude higher than the average over 5--19 years prior to TDE detection. Considering another two rTDEs with intervals of $\\sim$2 years in the sample and possible rTDEs missed by CRTS, rTDEs with intervals of $<20$ years may account for 25\\%--60\\% of the TDE sample. We prefer to explain rTDEs as repeating partial TDEs. If so, the high fraction of rTDEs suggests that the observed optical TDE rate has been overestimated. However, the possibility of independent TDEs cannot be ruled out and requires future observational tests.",

Lazio, Kaitlyn Szekerczes, Steinn Sigurdsson, Collin Dabbieri Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Spectroscopic observations of the quasar J0950$+$5128 spanning 22 years reveal monotonic radial velocity variations in its broad H$\\beta$ emission line. Moreover, the line profile becomes broader over time, necessitating careful measurements. We present robust H$\\beta$ velocity shift measurements obtained via cross correlation, applied to both the full spectra and to isolated broad H$\\beta$ components derived from spectral decomposition. We also examine the light curves for variability consistent with the spectroscopic trends. Using Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis we find no significant periodic signal. We consider several interpretations for the observed changes, including a binary supermassive black hole, dust-cloud obscuration, outflows, a recoiling black hole, and a single perturbed, disk-like broad-line region. We deem the binary and perturbed broad-line region scenarios to be physically plausible. The binary interpretation is the only one for which we can immediately compare a physical model to the available data. Thus, we incorporate radial velocity ''jitter'' to emulate typical quasar variability and fit the radial velocity curve with a Keplerian model to examine whether it can reproduce the observations. In this context, the available observations trace only a segment of the putative orbit. The fit yields a period of 33 years (observed frame) and an eccentricity of 0.65, with lower limits on the semi-major axis and black hole mass of $10^{-2}\\;$pc and $10^7\\;{\\rm M}_\\odot$, respectively. Thus, J0950$+$5128 is a binary candidate deserving further study. The single, perturbed broad-line region interpretation remains viable but requires additional observations and modeling for further evaluation. Continued monitoring is, therefore, essential.",

This version matches the final published version Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Astronomical objects that change rapidly give us insight into extreme environments, allowing us to identify new phenomena, test fundamental physics, and probe the Universe on all scales. Transient and variable radio sources range from the cosmological, such as gamma-ray bursts, to much more local events, such as massive flares from stars in our Galactic neighbourhood. The capability to observe the sky repeatedly, over many frequencies and timescales, has allowed us to explore and understand dynamic phenomena in a way that has not been previously possible. In the past decade, there have been great strides forward as we prepared for the revolution in time domain radio astronomy that is being enabled by the SKA Observatory telescopes, the SKAO pathfinders and precursors, and other `next generation' radio telescopes. Hence it is timely to review the current status of the field, and summarise the developments that have happened to get to our current point. This review focuses on image domain (or `slow') transients, on timescales of seconds to years. We discuss the physical mechanisms that cause radio variability, and the classes of radio transients that result. We then outline what an ideal image domain radio transients survey would look like, and summarise the history of the field, from targeted observations to surveys with existing radio telescopes. We discuss methods and approaches for transient discovery and classification, and identify some of the challenges in scaling up current methods for future telescopes. Finally, we present our current understanding of the dynamic radio sky, in terms of source populations and transient rates, and look at what we can expect from surveys on future radio telescopes.",

Macciò 10 pages, 10 figures, submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Aims. We aim to investigate the connection between star formation histories (SFHs) and the inner dark matter density profiles of simulated galaxies. In particular, we test whether the burstiness and temporal distribution of star formation influence the formation of cored versus cuspy dark matter profiles. Methods. We homogeneously analysed simulated galaxies from the NIHAO and FIRE-2 projects. For each galaxy, we derived dark matter density profiles and measured the logarithmic slope in the inner region of the dark matter halo (1-2% of R$_{\\rm vir}$). To characterise star formation burstiness, we introduced a criterion based on comparing the star formation rate (SFR) averaged over two distinct timescales. We further quantified the duration of SFHs by computing $M_{\\star, \\rm post}$ / $M_{\\star, \\rm pre}$, the ratio of stellar mass formed after versus before the epoch of reionisation at redshift z $\\sim$ 6.5. Results. Homogeneous analysis reveals that inner slope versus stellar-to-halo mass ratio trends for NIHAO and FIRE-2 galaxies are in much better agreement than reported in previous works. The burstiness and duration of the SFH explain the scatter in the inner slope versus stellar-to-halo mass ratio relation, revealing that galaxies with above average burstiness and more extended SFHs are more efficient at developing cored dark matter profiles. In contrast, galaxies with smoother SFHs and earlier stellar mass assembly tend to maintain cuspier dark matter profiles. We present an analytic expression that improves predictions for the inner slope using the parameter $M_{\\star \\rm,post}$ / $M_{\\star \\rm,pre}$, which reduces the mean squared error in both simulation suites relative to previous formulations based solely on the stellar-to-halo mass ratio.",

Afruni Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The spatial and kinematic structure of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) remains poorly constrained observationally. In this article we compute the clustering of CIV absorption systems at cosmic noon using quasar pairs. We analyze VLT/UVES and Keck/HIRES high-resolution spectra (R = 45000) of a sample of 8 projected and 4 lensed quasar pairs that probe transverse separations, $\\Delta r$, from sub-kpc to a few Mpc, over the redshift range 1.6 < z < 3.3. We detect and fit Voigt profiles to a total of 141 CIV systems, corresponding to 620 velocity components across all quasar lines-of-sight. We compute the two-point correlation function of CIV, $\\xi(\\Delta v, \\Delta r)$, where $\\Delta v$ is the velocity difference between components across all available scales. We find a strong dependence of $\\xi(\\Delta r)$ with $\\Delta r$ at all velocities. $\\xi(\\Delta r)$ reaches a sharp peak at the smallest scales analyzed here, $\\Delta r\\approx 0.1$ kpc, decreases steadily up to $\\Delta r\\approx 5$ kpc and remains flat up to $\\Delta r\\approx 500$ kpc, where it begins to decrease again. By fitting power-laws to the projected transverse correlation function $\\Xi(\\Delta r)$, we infer two coherence lengths: $r_1 = 654^{+100}_{-87}$ kpc, which we interpret as a representative size for the CIV enriched regions at $z\\approx 2$, and $r_2 = 4.70^{+1.60}_{-1.19}$ kpc for the individual CIV-bearing \"clouds\". Projecting instead in $\\Delta r$, we find consistent amplitudes of $\\xi(\\Delta v)$ with previous work using quasars and extended background sources. Our results suggest that CIV may be a good tracer of not only the small, internal structure of the circumgalactic medium, but also of the way in which galaxies cluster at cosmic noon.",

Yung The Astrophysical Journal, Submitted Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate galaxies in the GARDEN (Galaxies at All Redshifts Deciphered and Explained with the NIRSpec MSA) survey that show auroral emission lines, enabling spatially resolved measurements of electron temperature and direct oxygen abundances. Two galaxies have spectra suitable for this analysis: CANDELS 8005 at z=3.794 and CANDELS 7986 at z=4.702. For both, we measure auroral and key nebular emission-line fluxes across their full extent, allowing direct-method oxygen abundance determinations in individual spaxels. These observations demonstrate the viability of deep JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy for spatially resolved chemical analyses at high redshift, aided by weak nebular continua and low interstellar extinction. We derive global direct abundances of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.008 (+0.025, -0.027) for CANDELS 8005 and 7.89 (+0.027, -0.028) for CANDELS 7986. Emission-line diagnostics indicate neither galaxy hosts an active galactic nucleus. A first-order kinematic analysis suggests a potential merger in CANDELS 8005. The direct abundances agree with strong-line estimates from our data and recent high-redshift calibrations. We build emission line, radial velocity, strong-line abundance, electron temperature, and direct abundance maps for both galaxies. From these maps, we measure linear radial metallicity gradients of -0.111 (+0.026, -0.025) dex/kpc for CANDELS 8005 (statistically significant) and -0.093 +/- 0.088 dex/kpc for CANDELS 7986, where the large uncertainties limit significance. These results represent the first detection of a radial metallicity gradient from direct-method abundances with measurements taken in galaxies at z>0, supporting inside-out galaxy growth with feedback-regulated chemical enrichment.",

Variations in turbulence regime and density-magnetic-field alignment across the warm (WNM), unstable (UNM), and cold (CNM) neutral media should imprint distinct signatures on the power spectra and $EE/BB$ power ratio, yet the relative phase contributions remain poorly constrained. Using high-resolution 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a turbulent multiphase ISM coupled with synthetic dust polarization maps, we quantify phase-dependent turbulence, anisotropy, and alignment properties. We find that the trans-Alfvénic and transonic WNM and UNM are strongly anisotropic, exhibiting tight alignment of density and velocity structures with the local magnetic field. In contrast, the super-Alfvénic and supersonic CNM displays reduced anisotropy and weak alignment. These dynamical differences are reflected in the statistical scaling of fluctuations: the square root of the second-order velocity structure function exhibits a slope near $1/3$ in the WNM, near $1/2$ in the CNM, and intermediate in the UNM. Our synthetic observations reproduce the polarization power spectra measured by Planck. We find that polarization from UNM dust yields spectral indices most consistent with Planck, whereas WNM and CNM dust produce steeper and shallower spectra, respectively. The WNM yields $EE/BB>2$, the UNM gives $EE/BB\\sim2$, and the CNM yields $EE/BB\\approx1$. These results indicate that UNM dust could be the dominant contributor to the polarized foreground. We present predictions at 150 GHz to improve foreground separation.",

Submitted to The Astrophysical Journal (ApJ) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Despite its proximity, the mass of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the spiral galaxy M81 (NGC~3031) has remained uncertain, with previous dynamical measurements being unreliable. We present the first robust stellar-dynamical measurement of its mass using high-resolution, two-dimensional kinematics from JWST/NIRSpec observations of the central $3''\\times3''$. By tracing stellar motions in the near-infrared, our data penetrate the obscuring nuclear dust and allow for the separation of stellar light from the non-thermal AGN continuum. We modeled the kinematics using JAM within a Bayesian framework, exploring a comprehensive suite of models that systematically account for uncertainties in the point-spread function, orbital anisotropy, and stellar mass-to-light ratio. This ensemble modeling approach demonstrates that a central dark mass unambiguously drives the central rise in velocity dispersion. The models yield a robust SMBH mass of $M_{\\rm BH} = (4.78^{+0.07}_{-0.10})\\times10^7$ M$_\\odot$. This result resolves a long-standing uncertainty in the mass of M81's black hole and provides a crucial, reliable anchor point for SMBH-galaxy scaling relations.",

This galaxy, CAPERS-39810, exhibits a metallicity of 12 + log(O/H) = $6.73\\pm0.13$, indicative of its primitive chemical composition, resembling the early stages of galaxy formation in the Universe. We use JWST NIRSpec/MSA for spectroscopic analysis, complemented by photometric data from the COSMOS2025 catalog. Our analysis employs the R3 strong-line diagnostic method to estimate metallicity, due to the lack of auroral lines in the spectrum. The galaxy's emission lines, including Hb, [O III], Ha and He I, are clearly detected. The rest-frame equivalent widths of the strong hydrogen recombination lines are EW_0(Hb) = $184\\pm48$ Åand EW_0(Ha) = $1144\\pm48$ Å. Furthermore, we perform detailed spectral energy distribution modeling to derive a galaxy logarithmic stellar mass of $8.02^{+0.22}_{-0.34}$ $M_\\odot$.

We perform a modified cross-correlation analysis between $\\psi$ and the figure rotation pattern speed, as well as the misalignment between the disk spin axis and (a) the figure rotation axis, (b) the halo minor axis, and (c) the gas angular momentum axis. We use snapshots spanning a lookback time $t_{lb} ~4$ Gyr with 25 linearly-spaced lags from $ 0 - 2.33$ Gyr. We do not find evidence for a consistent lag between the onset of a warp and any of the aforementioned factors on the population level. However, we find significant correlations between individual time-series at various lags. These maximum correlation coefficients were significantly offset from random chance at the population level, suggesting that several of these factors do correlate with disk warping in specific situations. By examining four case studies whose maximum correlation coefficients were significantly higher than random chance, we establish clear qualitative relationships between these factors and warps. While a non-warped galaxy typically shows minimal halo tilt and figure rotation, warped galaxies can have strong/weak tilts and/or strong/weak figure rotation.

Marquez-Lugo, R. Ibarra-Nuño 62 pages, 31 figures. AJ. Accepted Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Using a sample of $\\sim$126,000 late-type galaxies (LTGs) from SDSS, we analyzed stellar mass as a function of dynamical mass. Stellar masses were estimated using eight SPS models with constant IMFs, while dynamical masses were derived from seven formulations based on Newtonian dynamics and virial equilibrium, incorporating both stellar and gas velocity dispersions. We account for key factors affecting dynamical mass estimation, including inclination, colour, concentration, and Sérsic index. We find that the difference between dynamical and stellar mass ($\\Delta \\log \\mathbf{M}$) ranges from nearly zero to $\\sim$95% of the dynamical mass, depending on mass and redshift. $\\Delta \\log \\mathbf{M}$ appears to decreases with increasing redshift, but exhibits a saddle-like shape at low mass and low redshift-especially in disk-dominated LTGs-transitioning into a steep, linear trend at higher masses and redshifts. In the high-mass regime, the behavior resembles that of early-type galaxies. Moreover, our results indicate that this evolution is not discrete but follows a continuous transition between morphological regimes. Dark matter within LTGs is at most equal to $\\Delta \\log \\mathbf{M}$, depending on the impact of the IMF and SPS on stellar mass estimation. Although SPS-based stellar masses do not include the gas component, previous studies have shown that galaxies with log($\\mathbf{M_{Stellar}/M_{Solar}}) > 10$ at $z \\leq 0.3$ are predominantly stellar-mass dominated. Most galaxies in our sample fall within this regime, minimizing the impact of gas exclusion. Our findings go beyond the scope of single galaxies, providing insight into the nearby Universe and highlighting the influence of dark matter in determining the Universe's structure and evolution.",

Notably, all three systems are viewed at low inclination (i.e., nearly face-on), prompting an investigation into the role of galaxy orientation in the detectability of LyC emission from disk systems. Two of the three galaxies, however, host active galactic nuclei (AGNs), adding complexity to the interpretation of the LyC signal. We present a detailed analysis of the likely star-forming case, and report tentative evidence that a face-on viewing angle may enhance the likelihood of LyC detection in disk galaxies. This represents the first detection of LyC emission from well-characterized spiral galaxies at high redshift, offering a new window into LyC escape mechanisms in such systems. Our findings highlight the need to consider geometric factors and anisotropic escape pathways facilitated by feedback processes alongside more traditional density-bounded scenarios that imply isotropic escape.",

Bauer 23 pages, 14 figures, 5 tables; accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The energy released by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is considered to have a profound impact on the cold gas properties of their host galaxies, potentially heating or removing the gas and further suppressing star formation. To understand the feedback from AGN radio activity, we investigate its impacts on the cold gas reservoirs in AGNs with different radio activity levels. We construct a quasar sample with a mean $z\\sim1.5$ and a mean $L_{\\rm bol}\\sim10^{45.8}\\ \\rm erg\\ s^{-1}$, all with Herschel detections to enable estimates of the total gas mass through the galactic dust continuum emission. The sample is then cross-matched with radio catalogs and divided into radio loud (RL) quasars, radio-detected radio quiet (RQ) quasars and radio-undetected quasars based on their radio loudness. Through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, we find the radio-detected RQ quasars exhibit evidence of gas deficiency with host galaxies possessing $\\sim 0.3$ dex lower dust and gas masses compared to the other two groups, despite being matched in $M_{\\rm BH}$, $L_{\\rm bol}$, $M_{*}$ and SFR. Furthermore, evidence from optical spectra shows that both the fraction and velocity of outflows are higher in the radio-detected RQ group, suggesting a connection between the ionized gas outflows and the moderate radio activity. These results suggest that the AGN feedback could be more efficient in AGNs with weak/moderate radio emission than in those without radio detection or those with strong radio emission. Further high-resolution observations are needed to understand the interaction between the interstellar medium and the weak/moderate AGN radio activity.",

Comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a JWST/NIRSpec rest-frame optical spectroscopic census of ALMA 1-mm continuum sources in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF) identified by the deep ALMA UDF and ASPECS programs. Our sample is composed of the ALMA flux-limited ($S_{1\\,\\mathrm{mm}}\\gtrsim 0.1\\,\\mathrm{mJy}$) sources observed with medium-resolution NIRSpec spectroscopy from JADES and SMILES, 16 faint submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at spectroscopic redshifts of $z\\sim 1$-$4$. These SMGs show bright longer-wavelength optical lines (H$\\alpha$, [N II]$\\lambda\\lambda6548,6583$, and [S II]$\\lambda\\lambda6717,6731$) and faint shorter-wavelength optical lines (H$\\beta$ and [O III]$\\lambda\\lambda4959,5007$) with a large nebular attenuation, $E(B-V)\\sim0.3$-$1.8$. We test the SMGs using BPT diagnostics and Chandra X-ray fluxes, and find that most SMGs are classified as AGNs; the AGN fraction is $\\sim80\\%$ for the SMGs at $M_*>10^{10.5} M_\\odot$. We find only one SMG ($<10\\%$) with a broad Balmer line, indicating that the SMGs are predominantly obscured AGNs. With the optical lines, we estimate the metallicities of the SMGs to be moderately high, $\\sim0.4$-$2 Z_\\odot$, exceeding the model-predicted dust-growth critical metallicity ($\\sim0.1$-$0.2Z_\\odot$), which naturally explains the dusty nature of the SMGs. Interestingly, the SMGs fall in the mass-metallicity relation and the star-formation main sequence, showing no significant differences from other high-$z$ galaxies. Similarly, we find electron densities of $n_e\\sim10^2$-$10^3\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ for the SMGs that are comparable with other high-$z$ galaxies. Together with the high SMG fraction ($\\sim 100\\%$) at the massive end ($M_*>10^{10.5} M_\\odot$), these results indicate that the SMGs are mostly not special, but typical massive star-forming galaxies at high redshift.",

Worrakitpoonpon 18 pages, 8 figures, accepted in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech) We use $N$-body simulations to investigate the distinct bar formation processes in disks residing in halos of various concentrations. In a highly concentrated halo, the bar development is limited by the dominant multi-arm modes as a result of the swing amplification in the early stage. Only after the multi-arm modes decay, the bar growth proceeds mechanically owing to the particle trapping in continuation of that bar seed. In this scheme, the corotation resonance of the bar modes does not come into play at all, justified by a low amount of disk-halo angular momentum transfer and a modestly decreasing bar pattern speed. On the other hand, although reducing the halo concentration suggests the reduction of the preferred swing-amplified modes to be bi-symmetric, the bar formation in a lowly concentrated halo does not involve the swing amplification at all. Rather, the fast-growing linearly unstable bar modes of a single uniform frequency is solely the governing factor, attributed to a mild shearing. The bar modes trigger the corotation resonance since the beginning and such resonance is maintained until the end, which leads to a high amount of angular momentum transfer and a fast slowdown. For the intermediate halo concentration, the kinematical analyses of multiple non-axisymmetric modes suggests that the linear modes, the swing amplification, and the particle trapping are all present in the evolution chronology. To specify bars formed in the different halo concentrations, full analyses of the isophotal shape, the radial Fourier amplitude, and the resonance diagram can be of use.",

Westendorp Plaza Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The chemical evolution of pre-stellar cores during their transition to a protostellar stage is not yet fully understood. Detailed chemical characterizations of these sources are needed to better define their chemistry during star formation. Our goal is to characterize the chemistry of the starless cores C2 and C16 in the B213/L1495 filament of the Taurus Molecular Cloud, and to understand how it relates to the environmental conditions and the evolutionary state of the cores. We made use of two complete spectral surveys at 7 mm of these sources, carried out using the Yebes 40-m telescope. Derived molecular abundances were compared with those of other sources in different evolutionary stages and with values computed by chemical models. Including isotopologs, 22 molecules were detected in B213-C2, and 25 in B213-C16. The derived rotational temperatures have values of between $\\sim$ 5 K and $\\sim$ 9 K. A comparison of the two sources shows lower abundances in C2, except for l-C$_{3}$H and HOCO$^{+}$, which have similar values in both cores. Model results indicate that both cores are best fit assuming early-time chemistry, and point to C2 being in a more advanced evolutionary stage, as it presents a higher molecular hydrogen density and sulfur depletion, and a lower cosmic-ray ionization rate. Our chemical modeling successfully accounts for the abundances of most molecules, including complex organic molecules and long cyanopolynes (HC$_{5}$N, HC$_{7}$N), but fails to reproduce those of the carbon chains CCS and C$_{3}$O. Chemical differences between C2 and C16 could stem from the evolutionary stage of the cores, with C2 being closer to the pre-stellar phase. Both cores are better fit assuming early-time chemistry of t $\\sim$ 0.1 Myr. The more intense UV radiation in the northern region of B213 could account for the high abundances of l-C$_{3}$H and HOCO$^{+}$ in C2.",

Liu, Kai-Xing Lu, Mouyuan Sun, Jian-Guo Wang 14 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, accepted by ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The radius-luminosity ($R_{\\rm BLR}$-$L_{5100}$) relation is fundamental to active galactic nucleus (AGN) studies, enabling supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass estimates and AGN-based cosmology applications. However, its high-luminosity end remains poorly calibrated due to insufficient reliable reverberation mapping (RM) data. We present a four-year RM campaign of the luminous quasar E1821+643 using the Lijiang 2.4-m telescope, supplemented by archival multi-wavelength data. E1821+643 is the most luminous AGN with an \\hb\\ RM measurement to date. The measured time lag of $83.2_{-18.7}^{+17.5}$ days is a factor of 5.6 shorter than predicted by the canonical $R_{\\rm BLR}$-$L_{5100}$ relation. By compiling the full \\hb\\ RM sample, we find that such deviation defines a lower envelope ($0.2R_{\\rm BLR}$) of measured lags across the entire luminosity range, while the upper envelope lies near $2R_{\\rm BLR}$, implying that the scatter for individual AGNs can reach 1 dex. Spectral decomposition reveals two distinct \\hb\\ components: a core component with a lag of $267.0_{-17.6}^{+16.6}$ days closer to the $R_{\\rm BLR}$-$L_{5100}$ relation, and a redshifted tail with a much shorter lag of $-49.0_{-34.5}^{+50.5}$ days. The short-lag component not only accounts for the significantly shortened overall lag, but also leads to an opposite interpretation of the intrinsic BLR kinematics. These effects can introduce systematic uncertainties in black hole mass estimates by factors of up to tens. Our findings demonstrate that shortened lags in high-accretion-rate AGNs arise from multi-component BLR structures, posing substantial challenges to single-epoch mass estimates and impacting SMBH demographics and cosmological applications.",

Different filament morphology types do not show significant differences in $\\alpha_{\\rm asy}$ or $f_{\\rm asy}$. A bent filament shape does not necessarily correspond to an asymmetric radial profile, whereas a straight filament shape may be associated with a symmetric profile.

We found three filaments with 4-44% of their spine show asymmetric $\\rm N(H_2)$ and $\\rm T_d$ radial profiles in inverse trends, likely caused by nearby HII region.

Among present-day stellar systems, only globular clusters retain the ancient signatures needed to trace these primordial building blocks. Here we present the most detailed characterization to date of Tonantzintla 2, a prime candidate for a relic of the Milky Way's primordial bulge. It is a moderately metal-rich globular cluster projected onto the bulge that has remained largely unexplored despite its potential to constrain the early formation of the inner Milky Way. We derive its fundamental parameters using proper motion-corrected Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 and ACS photometry. By applying an isochrone fitting to very clean data, we obtain an age of 13.58 Gyr, a reddening E(B-V) = 1.44, a metallicity [M/H]=-0.68, and a heliocentric distance of d = 7.38 kpc. A complementary chemical-abundance analysis of seven member stars from APOGEE high-resolution spectroscopy reveals an enrichment pattern consistent with an in-situ origin. Tonantzintla 2 is among the oldest globular clusters studied in the literature, and the oldest so far analyzed in the Galactic bulge. Its age places a stringent constraint on the onset of the bulge formation, implying that star formation in the inner Galaxy began within ~0.2 Gyr of the Big Bang and that Tonantzintla 2 represents an exceptional relic of the Milky Way's earliest chemical enrichment.",

Chibueze Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal on January 24, 2026 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Methanol (CH$_{3}$OH) is a key complex organic molecule (COM) in the interstellar medium, widely used as a tracer of dense gas and hot molecular cores (HMCs). Using high-resolution ALMA observations from the ATOMS survey, we investigate the excitation and abundance of methanol nuclear spin isomers and their relationship to chemical complexity in massive star-forming cores. We identify 20 methanol transitions, including A- and E-type lines in the v=0 state and E-type lines in the v$_{t}$=1 state, and detect 94 HMC candidates. Rotational temperature analysis under the LTE assumption yields average values of 194 $\\pm$ 33 K for CH$_{3}$OH-E v$_{t}$=1, 178 $\\pm$ 33 K for CH$_{3}$OH-A v=0, and 75 $\\pm$ 33K for CH$_{3}$OH-E v=0. Emission from COMs other than methanol is detected in 87 of the 94 cores, with the CH$_{3}$OH-E v$_{t}$=1 line intensity showing a strong correlation with the channel detection ratio (CDR). These results demonstrate that CH$_{3}$OH-E v$_{t}$=1 lines are reliable tracers of HMCs and chemical complexity, and that the CDR provides a robust indicator of molecular richness. The temperature difference between A- and E-type methanol transitions is driven by anomalously strong J(2,J-2)$-$J(-1,J-1) lines, highlighting the importance of analyzing methanol symmetry types separately.",

These parameters are specifically designed to quantify the steepness of the cumulative radial distribution of stars in the innermost region of the host system, which tends to progressively increase with dynamical aging due to core contraction. Following the original definitions, here we measure A5 and P5 in a sample of 40 Galactic GCs homogeneously surveyed through HST photometric observations. In agreement with the predictions of our simulations, the largest values of A5 and P5 are found for the most dynamically evolved GCs, i.e., those previously classified as post-core collapse systems based on the shape of their density profile, and those characterized by the shortest central relaxation times. Moreover, the new dynamical parameters here measured strongly correlate with A+rh, another fully empirical, independent parameter that traces the dynamical age of star clusters through the level of central segregation of blue straggler stars.",

Conger 13 pages, 10 figures, submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) It is still not clear which environmental processes operate in filaments. Given the ubiquity of filaments and their importance in feeding clusters, a proper understanding of these mechanisms is crucial to a more complete picture of galaxy evolution. To investigate them, we need large galaxy samples with resolved imaging. For this study, we analyse resolved H$\\alpha$ maps of 685 galaxies inside and outside the filaments around the Virgo cluster in addition to extensive measurements of integrated physical properties. We create a pipeline to decompose the H$\\alpha$ images into individual clumps. We find that the number and average size of clumps in a galaxy are well-defined functions of distance and angular resolution. In particular, the power-law relation between the number of clumps and the distance of a galaxy is consistent with a fractal structure of star forming regions. We formulate an algorithm to compare filament and non-filament galaxies after removing observational differences. Although we do not have any conclusive evidence for a difference in clump size distributions between filament and non-filament galaxies, we do find that filament galaxies have slightly more peripheral clumps than their non-filament counterparts.",

This makes DEBS crucial targets for constraining the impact of various physical processes on stellar structure and evolution. Long-period binaries are particularly interesting because their separation minimises interactions between the components. This makes long-period binaries more comparable to single stars. However, the current sample of DEBS with high precision stellar parameters are dominated by short-period systems (e.g. ~90% of the Gaia DR3 eclipsing binaries have periods < 5 days). Facilities capable of performing detailed studies of long-period DEBS will be essential to further improve our understanding of stellar structure and evolution. Such facilities would need to be able to obtain spectroscopic observations of more distant objects at high resolution and cadence. 2-8m class telescopes with echelle spectrographs and an ability to monitor a large sample of stars would be required.",

Perotti Astronomy and Astrophysics 2026 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) This study characterizes the physical and kinematic properties within the innermost 500 au region of the L1527 bipolar outflow, a Class 0/I low-mass protostar using JWST MIRI/MRS spectroscopy across 5-28 micron at 0.2-1.0 arcsec resolution. We identify emission lines from molecular and ionized species and analyze their spatial morphology using line integrated intensity maps. We derive gas temperature and column density through excitation diagram analysis of H2 rotational lines and compared results with shock models. The observations reveal extended molecular hydrogen emission tracing the bipolar outflow, with the H2 gas temperatures distributed into warm (~550 K) and hot (~2500 K) components, likely originating from moderate velocity J-type shocks and some UV irradiation. We detect forbidden atomic and ionized emission lines of [Ni ii], [Ar ii], [Ne ii], [Ne iii], [S i], and [Fe ii] showing spatially extended morphology. Double peaked emission profiles were seen in [Ar ii], [Ne iii], and [Fe ii], in the eastern region, suggesting that the high velocity component traces a fast, highly ionized jet. Radial velocity map derived from [Ne ii] emission shows the eastern region to be redshifted and the western region blueshifted, contrary to earlier interpretations. The analysis of the MIRI/MRS observations reveals the presence of molecular, atomic, and ionized emission lines in this low-mass protostar connected with active outflow signatures. The most striking feature discovered is the presence of a poorly collimated high velocity ionized jet, embedded within a broader wide-angle molecular outflow likely driven by a disk wind. The co-existence of these components supports a stratified outflow structure and suggest L1527 exhibits unique jet-launching characteristics atypical for its early evolutionary stage.",

III: Quiescent Galaxies Loose Angular Momentum as They Evolve in a Mass-dependent Fashion Zhiyuan Ji, Mauro Giavalisco 18 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We study the evolution of stellar kinematics of a sample of 952 massive quiescent galaxies with $M_*>10^{10.5}M_\\odot$ at $0.6<z<1$. Utilizing spatially integrated spectroscopy from the LEGA-C survey, we focus on the relationship between the observed integrated stellar velocity dispersion ($\\sigma^\\prime_{star}$) and the morphological axial ratio ($q$), and its variation with the stellar age and mass of quiescent galaxies. For the youngest quiescent galaxies, regardless of stellar mass, $\\sigma^\\prime_{star}$ decreases with increasing $q$, a trend that is consistent with a system having significant rotation and hence suggests that massive galaxies still retain significant amount of angular momentum in the aftermath of quenching. As they continue to evolve, the variation of the $\\sigma^\\prime_{star}$-$q$ relationship depends on stellar mass. For quiescent galaxies with $M_*<10^{11.3}M_\\odot$, $\\sigma^\\prime_{star}$ decreases with $q$ in all stellar-age bins, suggesting that the quiescent populations of this mass regime retain significant rotation even long time after quenching. In contrast, for more massive quiescent galaxies with $M_*>10^{11.3}M_\\odot$, the relationship between $\\sigma^\\prime_{star}$ and $q$ becomes significantly flattened with increasing stellar age. This indicates that, as the very massive galaxy populations continue to evolve after quenching, angular momentum gradually reduces, which eventually transforms them into velocity-dispersion supported systems. We suggest that incoherent, continuous merging and accretion events onto the galaxies are the main drivers of the observed mass-dependent, posting-quenching dynamical evolution, because more massive galaxies are more likely to undergo such interactions. We are witnessing the early formation epoch of fast and slow rotators at $z \\sim 0.8$, when the Universe was only half of its age nowadays.",

To obtain the spectral energy distribution (SED), we exploited the CIGALE software and constructed SEDs without (model A) and with (model B) AGN module. The type of nuclear activity of NGC 3521 is confirmed as the LINER. We also present the results of the photometric data processing. Exploring the ZTF observations in 2018-2024, we found, for the first time, a weak photometric variability of the nuclear activity, where the correlation between g-r color indices and g-magnitude for long-term timescale shows a BWB trend (bluer-when-brighter) with a Pearson coefficient r(g-r)=0.56, which is a medium correlation. To detect the variability of NGC 3521 during the day (IDV), we provided observations using a Zeiss-600 telescope with an aperture size of 8\" at the Terskol observatory. The data obtained in the R-filter with an exposure of 90 sec for three hours on Feb 11, 2022, serve in favor of a trend towards an increase in brightness with the amplitude of variability of 0.04 +- 0.001 mag. According to the results of the simulations, the best fit to the observed SED is provided by model A, which considers the contribution to the radiation from all galaxy components, assuming that the galaxy nucleus is inactive. Within this model, we derived the stellar mass M$_{star}$ = 2.13 * 10$^{10} M_{Sun}$, the dust mass M$_{dust}$ = 8.45 * 10$^{7} M_{Sun}$, and the star formation rate SFR = 1.76 $M_{Sun}$ * yr$^{-1}$ with $\\chi^{2}$/d.o.f = 1.8. Also, based on the HIPASS radio data, we estimated the mass of neutral hydrogen to be M$_{HI}$ = 1.3 * 10$^{10} M_{Sun}$, which is an order of magnitude greater than the mass of the stellar component.",

By defining global environments, nodes, filaments, and voids within the Horizon Run 5 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, we explore when and where the enrichment of galaxies occurs, analysing key evolution parameters such as star-formation rate and changes in gas-fraction and gas-metallicity per unit time. At high redshift ($z>4.5$), there are minimal deviations from the MZR due to environment, however, larger deviations emerge as redshift decreases. Low stellar mass galaxies in nodes, $M_{\\star} < 10^{9.8}\\,\\text{M}_{\\odot}$, start showing deviations at $z = 3.5$, whilst other environments do not. For, $z < 2$, filaments and voids begin to show deviations above and below the MZR, respectively. By $z = 0.625$, the last epoch of HR5, deviations exist for all stellar masses and environments, with a maximum value of 0.13 dex at $M_{\\star} \\approx 10^{9.35}\\,\\text{M}_{\\odot}$, between the median gas metallicities of node and void galaxies. To explain this environmental variance we discuss gas accretion, AGN, ram-pressure-stripping and strangulation as regulators of $Z_{g}$. Concurrently, at high metallicities, for $z < 2$, while massive galaxies in nodes show increasing $Z_{g}$ and decreasing [O/Fe], void galaxies show a turnover where $Z_{g}$ falls with decreasing [O/Fe]. This directly points to the importance of cold-gas accretion in retaining lower $Z_{g}$ in massive void galaxies for $z < 2$, whilst its absence in nodes allowed $Z_{g}$ to access higher values.",

Swinbank (Durham-CEA) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a novel method of combining kinematic models obtained at multiple spatial resolution levels in a self-consistent manner. The MHONGOOSE survey has mapped atomic hydrogen emission in $30$ nearby dwarf and spiral galaxies. Each galaxy is imaged at multiple resolution levels with unprecedented dynamic range in spatial resolution (from $\\sim 10''$ to $ 90''$) and HI sensitivity, with the latter varying by almost a factor of $30$ across all resolution scales. We use radial weighting functions to combine kinematic models from all resolution levels. The weights are derived from the residuals of model fits to a set of observations of synthetic model galaxies with known rotation curves and geometries. We obtain combined (weighted and smoothed) inclination and position angle profiles for each galaxy. These suppress the sharp, often unphysical radial fluctuations arising in single-resolution profiles. We then fit the rotation speed and velocity dispersion profiles at each resolution level with the geometric profiles fixed to the combined profiles, finally combining these using the same weighting and smoothing approach. The combined rotation curves utilise all of the available information and have smaller typical systematic errors compared to those obtained using a single resolution level, particularly near the centres and outer edges of models. This initial demonstration is promising; there is scope to further refine the process to use such information-rich observations to their full potential.",

Spinoglio 17 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Cosmic rays (CRs), from active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets and supernovae (SNe), serve as a significant feedback mechanism influencing emission lines in narrow line region (NLR) clouds. These highly energetic particles, propelled by shocks, heat the interstellar medium (ISM) and modify its chemical composition. This study investigates the role of CRs, particularly in their ability to excite gas and align with observed line ratios across UV and optical diagnostics. We employ CLOUDY to explore CR ionization rate, ionization parameter, and initial hydrogen density effects on optical and mid-infrared (MIR) emission. Our analysis includes high-quality optical data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) for NGC 5728, supplemented by infrared observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our previous results indicate that CRs are instrumental in heating the inner regions of gas clouds, enhancing emission of low-ionization optical lines. Mid-infrared data reveal that emission lines like [Ar II] and [Ne II] within the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) field of view are sensitive to CRs. In contrast, high-ionization lines (for example, [Ne V]) serve as robust tracers of photoionization insensitive to CRs. Moreover, mixed optical and MIR diagnostics offer insight into the relative roles of CRs and shocks, which often produce similar signatures in emission lines. We find that while both mechanisms can elevate certain line ratios, their influence on MIR diagnostics diverges: shocks and CRs affect low-ionization lines differently, allowing for a better understanding when multi-wavelength data are available. Our approach not only helps to resolve the degeneracy between metallicity and CR ionization but also enables the potential differentiation of shocks and CR-driven processes in AGN.",

Bolton, Matteo Viel, Enrico Garaldi 14 pages, 11 figures, Version accepted for publication in MNRAS Main Journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Interpreting Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest properties during the epoch of reionization requires assumptions about the spectral energy distribution (SED) of ionizing sources. These are often simplified to blackbody or power-law spectra, potentially overlooking contributions from high-energy processes. In this work, we investigate how different SED models of reionization-era sources shape the thermal and ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and imprint on the Ly$\\alpha$ forest during the late stages of reionization. We perform $3D$ radiative transfer simulations with CRASH, post-processed on Sherwood-type hydrodynamical outputs, exploring both physically motivated SEDs including X-ray binaries, Bremsstrahlung from shock-heated interstellar medium, and binary stars and idealized blackbody and power-law spectra. While the large-scale morphology of ionized regions is broadly similar across all models, harder spectral components extend partially ionized zones, produce larger He III regions, and heat the surrounding IGM. By adopting simplified spectra there is the risk of underestimating the contribution of high-energy sources, which for most models we consider are found to alter the effective optical depth, the flux power, and the local transmissivity within the current $\\sim 1 \\sigma$ measurement uncertainties. The differences across models are most pronounced in the behavior of the proximity zone and in the power at intermediate scales, offering the most promising diagnostics to disentangle source populations. With upcoming high precision measurements from ELT and DESI, realistic SED modelling will be essential for robustly connecting Ly$\\alpha$ forest observations to the sources driving the end of reionization.",

Here we report on the astronomical detection of a six-membered sulfur-bearing cyclic hydrocarbon in the interstellar medium. Observations of the Galactic Centre molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027 reveal the presence of 2,5-cyclohexadien-1-thione, which is a structural isomer of thiophenol ($c$-C$_6$H$_6$S). For the astronomical identification, we first performed precise laboratory measurements of the thiophenol discharge products system. These measurements, conducted in the radio band using a chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave spectrometer, enabled us to characterize this highly polar molecular species and provided unambiguous fingerprints needed to identify this organosulfur compound in space, which now ranks as the largest interstellar sulfur-bearing molecule. These results herald the discovery of a family of prebiotically relevant sulfur-bearing species, which potentially act as a bridge between the chemical inventory of the interstellar medium and the composition of the minor bodies of the Solar System.",

Submitted to A&A; comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present an analysis of archival JWST NIRSpec IFS and HST imaging observations of the z = 3 Lyman-Continuum Emitter (LCE) candidate LACES104037. We show that a nearby galaxy, denoted LACES104037-S, has a redshift offset from the main galaxy by only $\\sim 450$ km/s. Together with the identification of tidal bridge features between the galaxies, this indicates that the galaxies are interacting and most likely in the early stages of a merger. We show that the restframe LCE cluster sits in a tidal bridge towards the companion, about 2.7 kpc from the galaxy's core. It is faint in non-ionizing stellar continuum, and shows faint but non-negligible H{\\alpha} and [O III] emission, suggesting that much of the gas surrounding the LCE cluster has been dispersed by feedback in the shallower gravitational potential of the tidal bridge. From comparing the direct LyC escape and the local H{\\alpha} emission, we find a total ionizing LyC escape fraction of $f_{\\mathrm{esc}} = 57 \\pm 8\\%$ from the LCE cluster. We estimate the age of the LCE cluster to be $\\lesssim 6.5$ Myr, indicating that the cluster must have formed in situ in the tidal bridge well after the time of closest interaction. LyC escape from tidal stripping or in-situ formed stars in tidal features would depend less on intrinsic galaxy properties than typically observed in low-z LCE surveys, and could help explain the higher cosmic escape fraction as well as the enhanced diversity of LCE galaxy properties observed at Cosmic Noon.",

While six-dimensional phase-space data of Galactic streams enable precise dark matter halo modelling in the Milky Way, streams around external galaxies are typically available only as low surface brightness features without kinematics (i.e. two-dimensional photometric data), providing only weak constraints when considered individually. We present a hierarchical Bayesian framework that infers the population distribution of halo flattening using only projected stream tracks. Streams are forward-modelled in StreaMAX, a new JAX-accelerated particle-spray package that achieves orders of magnitude faster stream generation when compared to traditional methods. For each stream we fit an axisymmetric dark matter halo model and obtain a posterior on the flattening. These posteriors are then combined through hierarchical reweighting to constrain the population distribution. Using mock data, we show that individual fits recover the correct flattening with modest precision and exhibit projection-induced multi-modalities. Nevertheless, aggregating these fits yields accurate and confident constraints on the underlying population distribution of dark matter halo morphologies, clearly distinguishing between oblate, spherical, and prolate populations. The total computational cost scales linearly with sample size. Our results demonstrate that ensembles of purely photometric streams carry sufficient information to constrain dark matter halo shapes in external galaxies at the population level. With the forthcoming samples from Euclid and Rubin/LSST, this approach offers a practical path to population-level inferences of halo morphology without any kinematic measurements.",

In this work, we demonstrate that II can also probe internal stellar kinematics by revealing a time-asymmetric Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) effect, causing a measurable shift in the temporal correlation peak away from zero delay. We develop numerical models to simulate this effect for two distinct astrophysical scenarios: an emission-line circumstellar disk and an absorption-line binary system. Our simulations reveal a clear sensitivity of this temporal asymmetry to the system's inclination angle, velocity symmetry, and internal dynamics. This suggests that, with sufficiently high time resolution, II can be used to extract quantitative information about internal kinematics, offering a new observational window on stellar dynamics.",

These systems have AU-scale separations and are thought to have undergone mass transfer (MT) when the WD progenitor was an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. Using high-resolution spectroscopy, we measure chemical abundances of the MS stars, focusing on s-process elements. Since s-process nucleosynthesis occurs mainly in AGB stars, s-process enhancement in the MS star is a key signature of accretion from an AGB companion. We identify 43 barium dwarfs -- 39 of them newly discovered -- roughly doubling the known population in astrometric WD+MS binaries and extending it to lower metallicities than previously studied. The s-process abundances show large star-to-star variations that correlate with component masses and with metallicity but not with orbital separation. At the lowest metallicities, three barium dwarfs display strong CH and $\\rm C_2$ absorption bands, confirming a link between barium stars and CEMP-s stars and implying that AGB mass transfer usually leads to strong carbon enhancement at low metallicity. By comparing the observed abundance patterns to AGB nucleosynthesis models, we show that the diversity of s-process enhancements can be explained by variations in donor mass, metallicity, and most importantly, the number of thermal pulses the AGB star experienced before the onset of MT. Variation in the depth of the accretors' convective envelopes, with which accreted material is diluted, strengthens correlations with MS star mass and metallicity. Our results establish Gaia WD+MS binaries -- which are homogeneously selected and probe shorter orbital periods than previous barium-star samples -- as a powerful laboratory for constraining mass transfer physics and the origin of chemically peculiar stars.",

Light curves extracted from FFIs can be used to measure stellar rotation periods ($P_{\\rm rot}$) in nearby open clusters, and are well-suited for studying low-mass stars ($\\lesssim$1.2 M$_\\odot$) younger than $\\approx$1 Gyr, whose $P_{\\rm rot}$ are generally still $\\leq$15 days. A challenge to exploiting TESS data fully is its 21$''$ pixel size, which can cause strong signals from a source to contaminate the signals of nearby sources in the crowded environments found, e.g., in the more distant and/or richest clusters. We conducted a test with the young ($\\approx$350 Myr old), moderately distant (470 pc), and rich open cluster NGC 3532 ($N_\\star$ > 3000), which has an extensive $P_{\\rm rot}$ catalog from ground-based photometry, to examine the reliability of $P_{\\rm rot}$ obtained from TESS data. We recovered 69% of the literature periods from at least one of the three TESS cycles in which NGC 3532 was observed before any quality analysis. We then used all available TESS data for low-mass members of NGC 3532 and, applying a set of quality cuts that combined information from TESS and from Gaia, measured $P_{\\rm rot}$ for 885 cluster stars, adding 706 new $P_{\\rm rot}$ to the existing catalog. We conclude that, when considered with appropriate caution, TESS data for stars in crowded fields can yield reliable $P_{\\rm rot}$ measurements.",

The satellites allow temperature to be found for these relatively low-temperature spectra, at which more conventional temperature-dependent line ratios are unavailable. By this means, the spectra can be arranged by temperature, showing that the \\ion{Fe}{17} lines are evident at temperatures of $<3$~MK. We confirm that the problem of the underintense Fe XVII 3C and 3D lines is not due to resonant scattering, and instead suggest that, for comparison with CHIANTI spectra, the problem may lie with a needed revision of collisional excitation rates. The line ratio 3G/3H is in theory density-dependent but for \\ion{Fe}{17} the ratio is in the low-density limit. However, we suggest that spectra taken during the impulsive stage of flares might reveal a departure from this limit and so allow densities to be derived and hence properties of the flaring plasma.

We find that a linear model, specifically a Skumanich-type relation, can best describe the overall decline of chromospheric activity with age, with the slope varying across different spectral types. However, we also identify variations in the decay rate along the main sequence, which call for more accurate follow-up investigation.

The flare triggers at 16:24~UT on June 7$^{th}$, 2017 from an active region (AR) 12661, and it maximizes at 16:54~UT. The magnetic flux cancellation occurs near the polarity inversion line (PIL) preceding the flare, and ultraviolet (UV) brightenings occur in the pre-flare phase at the flux cancellation sites, suggesting the reconnection occurs in the lower atmosphere, initially. The S-shaped sigmoid forms through successive steps in corona, i.e., small-scale brightenings, helical/twisted field lines, bright patches, and finally, a developed sigmoid. It justifies that runaway reconnection within the coronal arcades forms the sigmoid within the filament. The differential emission-measure (DEM) analysis reveals the existence of the plasma at a temperature of more than 10 MK within the sigmoid. The initial magnetic reconnection reorganizes the field overlying the filament as per the tether-cutting model. Therefore, it enables the filament to rise slowly, and around~16:41~UT, the eruption phase of the filament begins. The filament eruption removes the overlying coronal field, including the sigmoid. During the eruption phase, we have found intersecting/crossing of coronal loops and jet-like structures far away from the sigmoid-filament system. In conclusion, all the observational findings (e.g., magnetic flux convergence, cancellation, UV brightenings, and spatial and temporal correlation between formation/evolution of the sigmoid and rise/eruption of the filament) suggest that the formation of a solar flare and the eruption of the filament are consistent with the tether-cutting model of solar eruption.",

      "abstract": "Inferring photospheric horizontal flows from multiple observations with SUVEL models Quan Xie, Jiajia Liu, Robert Erdélyi, Yuming Wang 11 pages, 4 figures, accepted by the Astrophysical Journal Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Photospheric horizontal velocity fields play essential roles in the formation and evolution of numerous solar activities. Various methods for estimating the horizontal velocity field have been proposed in the past. Aiming at the highest available (and future) spatial resolution (10 km/pixel) observations, a new method the Shallow U-net models (SUVEL) based on realistic numerical simulation and machine learning techniques was recently developed to track the photospheric horizontal velocity fields. Although SUVEL has been tested on numerical simulation data, its performance on solar observational data remained unclear. In this work, we apply SUVEL to the photospheric intensity observations from four ground-based solar telescopes (DKIST, GST, NVST, and SST) with the largest available apertures, and compare the results obtained from SUVEL with the Fourier local correlation tracking method (FLCT). Average correlation indices between granular regions and velocity fields inferred by SUVEL (FLCT) are 0.63, 0.81, 0.80, and 0.87 (0.00, 0.11, 0.16, and 0.10) for DKIST, GST, NVST, and SST observations. Higher correlation indices between the velocity fields tracked by SUVEL and granular patterns than FLCT reveal the superior performance of SUVEL, validating its reliability with respect to solar observational data.",

However, the mechanisms behind mass loss, particularly at the end of AGB, are still not well understood. We aim to investigate the relationship between stellar parameters and envelope dynamics during the TP-AGB phase, evaluating whether dynamical instabilities in the envelope can act as a possible mass-loss mechanism. We use hydrodynamics method in MESA to simulate the dynamical pulsations and resulting mass loss during the TP-AGB phase of a star evolved from a 1.5 Msun zero-age main sequence. Our simulations reproduce the dynamical pulsation behavior of stars during the TP-AGB phase, demonstrating that the envelope mass is a key factor governing pulsational properties. As the envelope mass decreases, both the pulsation period and radial amplitude increase, consistent with observational trends. For 1.5 Msun model, once the envelope mass declines to approximately 0.25 Msun, the model enters a regime of violent pulsations, potentially ejecting the remaining envelope within a few hundred years. We suggest that the instability can act as the dominant mass-loss mechanism in the end of the TP-AGB phase, marking a rapid transitional stage toward the post-AGB phase.",

Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics, 131, e2025JA034777 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) Past kinetic simulations and spacecraft observations have shown that traveling foreshocks (TFs) are bounded by either foreshock compressional boundaries (FCBs) or foreshock bubbles (FBs). Here we present four TFs with a different kind of structure appearing at one of their edges. Two of them, observed by the Cluster mission, are bounded by a hot flow anomaly (HFA). In one case, the HFA was observed only by the spacecraft closest to the bow shock, while the other three probes observed an FCB. In addition, two other TFs were observed by the MMS spacecraft to be delimited by a structure that we call HFA-like FCB. In the spacecraft data, these structures present signatures similar to those of HFAs: dips in magnetic field magnitude and solar wind density, decelerated and deflected plasma flow and increased temperature. However, a detailed inspection of these events reveals the absence of heating of the SW beam. Instead, the beam almost disappears inside these events and the plasma moments are strongly influenced by the suprathermal particles. We suggest that HFA-like FCBs are related to the evolution and structure of the directional discontinuities of the interplanetary magnetic field whose thickness is larger than the gyroradious of suprathermal ions. We also show that individual TFs may appear together with several different types of transient upstream mesoscale structures, which brings up a question about their combined effect on regions downstream of the bow shock.",

Simulations with different ion-to-electron mass ratios are set up to investigate the role of electron scales in the formation of intermittent structures. We analyze the current sheet structures that develop in these simulations. Two algorithms, namely Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), are employed to determine the thickness, length, and width of the current sheets, and both methods are found to yield consistent results. The average current sheet thickness scales inversely with the square root of the ion-to-electron mass ratio, with values close to the electron skin depth ($d_e$), indicating the presence of electron-scale current sheets in the simulations. The widths and lengths of the current sheets show a weaker scaling with the mass ratio. The scale-dependent kurtosis reveals enhanced intermittency at electron scales, consistent with magnetosheath observations. Distributions of scale-dependent properties of the current sheets also align with the electron skin depth of the different simulations and they lie within ranges observed in kinetic scale solar wind turbulence. This study reveals the nature of sub-ion-scale current sheets in KAW turbulence and their role in dissipation.",

This article retraces the main stages of solar instrumental developments in Meudon, from its foundation by Jules Janssen in 1876 to the present day, limited to ground-based or balloon instrumentation, designed in Meudon and installed there or in other places (Nan{\\c c}ay, Pic du Midi, Canary Islands). The Meudon astronomers played a pioneering role in the history of solar physics through the experimentation of innovative techniques. After the golden age of inventions, came the time of large instruments, studied in Meudon but often installed in more favourable sites, and that of space, in a framework of international collaboration, but this is not discussed here.",

Zola 22 pages, 11 figures, submitted to A&A on 22.01.2026 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The microlensing event Gaia20fnr is a long-duration, non-caustic-crossing binary-lens event at high Galactic latitude. Triggered by a photometric rise detected by the Gaia space mission, the event was followed up with observations from multiple ground-based facilities and four space telescopes: Gaia, NEOWISE, Swift, and TESS. We characterize the Gaia20fnr microlensing system by determining the physical and orbital properties of the binary lens, the nature of the luminous source, and the kinematics of both the source and the lens. We employed a binary-lens microlensing model including full Keplerian orbital motion and annual microlens parallax to fit the photometric data. The event is best explained by a K2 giant source at $D_{\\rm S} = 3.10 \\pm 0.10\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$ lensed by a stellar binary composed of $M_{\\rm L,1} = 0.46 \\pm 0.06\\,M_\\odot$ and $M_{\\rm L,2} = 0.52 \\pm 0.06\\,M_\\odot$ at a distance of $D_{\\rm L} = 0.54 \\pm 0.05\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$. The light curve exhibits strong signatures of orbital motion and requires a full Keplerian model with a period of $P = 0.67 \\pm 0.04\\,\\mathrm{yr}$ and a radial-velocity semi-amplitude of $K_1 = 16.9 \\pm 0.9\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$. Gaia20fnr is one of the few microlensing events for which a complete Keplerian binary-lens solution has been derived. The model can be tested with follow-up radial-velocity and high-resolution imaging observations as well as forthcoming Gaia DR4 and DR5 astrometric time-series data. Its long duration, multi-peak structure, and extensive coverage make it a benchmark for studying faint nearby low-mass binaries through microlensing.",

Patchy clouds, auroral processes, stratospheric hot spots, and complex carbon chemistry have all been proposed as potential sources of this variability. Using time-resolved, low-to-mid-resolution spectroscopy collected with the JWST/NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments, we apply harmonic analysis to SIMP J013656.5+093347, a highly variable, young, isolated planetary-mass object. Odd harmonics (k = 3) at pressure levels ~ 1 bar, corresponding to iron and forsterite cloud formation, suggest a potential North-South hemispheric asymmetry in the cloudy, and likely equatorial, regions. We use the inferred harmonics, along with 1-D substellar atmospheric models, to map the flux variability by atmospheric pressure level. We identify distinct time-varying structures in the near-infrared that we interpret as planetary-scale wave (e.g., Rossby or Kelvin)-associated cloud modulation. We detect deviations from bulk (composite) variability in water (S/N = 14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands, providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the lowest pressures (< 100 mbar), we find mapped methane lines transition from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral heating via electron precipitation.",

While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($\\eta \\propto T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the ensemble of electron gyro-axes in a magnetized plasma as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the \"frozen-in\" condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the mean magnetic field. Unlike stochastic turbulence models, this framework predicts a coherent, explosive onset of resistivity that naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. We support this thesis with renormalization group theory and a novel analysis of Magnetospheric Multiscale mission data, which reveals an explosive phase space confinement consistent with collective phase slippage rather than chaotic scattering. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.",

Instead of sampling parameters uniformly within bounded regions, we extend the distribution beyond prior boundaries with smooth Gaussian tails. This eliminates sharp discontinuities that cause neural posterior estimators to fail when the posterior distribution intersects or extends beyond the prior bounds. The method requires minimal hyperparameter tuning, with tail widths of 10--30\\% of the prior width proving robust across problems. We demonstrate these benefits on a synthetic Gaussian linear task and cosmological parameter inference from the matter power spectrum. We also find that \\tail-trained models outperform \\textsc{Uniform} ones near the boundaries across various training set sizes and dimensions of the parameter space. This advantage grows in higher dimensions, where boundaries dominate parameter space volume. All code is publicly available on Github at this https URL.",

Wheeler Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We discuss the suite of STIS calibration programs executed during HST Cycle 30, covering the period 2022 Nov 07 through 2023 Nov 05. For each of the 19 current regular calibration programs, we provide brief descriptions of the objectives, observations, analysis procedures, and results - with comparisons to the results from previous cycles and to desired accuracies, as well as references to more detailed analyses of the calibration data. Many of these calibration programs produce routine reference file deliveries or demonstrate the continuing applicability of existing reference files for processing STIS observations. This ISR provides a brief snapshot of the current instrument performance, similar to those given in annual reports for Cycles 7-10 and 17-21. Two Appendices briefly discuss the state of the onboard calibration lamps and the ongoing major effort to revise the flux calibration for the many STIS spectroscopic and imaging modes.",

By optimizing the detection parameters and implementing a screening procedure that jointly evaluates the signal-to-noise ratio and central sharpness, the pipeline effectively identifies faint point sources that were previously undetected. Applying this method to eight representative sky regions improves the 2MASS detection limit from 16.20 to 16.60 mag and increases the number of detected point sources by approximately 21.36% relative to the 2MASS Point Source Catalog, with a false-positive rate of only 4.80%.

Supporting information to be published by the journal along with the paper Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph) Small asteroids and large meteoroids frequently impact the Earth, though their physical and material properties remain poorly understood. When observed as fireballs in Earth's atmosphere, these properties can be inferred from their ablation and fragmentation behavior. The 2022 release of previously classified United States Government (USG) satellite sensor data has provided hundreds of new fireball light curves, allowing for more detailed analysis. Here we present a new Bayesian inference method based on dynamic nested sampling that can robustly estimate these objects' physical parameters from their observed light curves, starting from relatively uninformative, flat priors. We validate our method against seven USG sensor-observed fireballs with independent ground-based observations and demonstrate that our results are consistent with previous estimates. We then apply our technique to $13$ decameter-size Earth impactors to conduct the most detailed population-level study of their structure and material strength to date. We identify three structurally distinct groups within the decameter impactors. The first group are primarily structurally homogeneous, weak objects which catastrophically disrupt below $\\sim1.5$ MPa. The second group are heterogeneous objects which progressively fragment starting from $\\sim1$ MPa typically up to $\\sim3-8$ MPa. The third group are strong aggregates which remain mostly intact until $9-10$ MPa. Our results also suggest that decameter-size asteroids fragment in two distinct phases: an initial phase at $\\sim0.04-0.09$ MPa and a second at $\\sim1-4$ MPa. While decimeter- to meter-size objects typically lose most of their mass in the initial phase, larger decameter-size objects instead lose most of their mass in the second phase.",

While the Newtonian point-mass approximation suffices for many preliminary studies, real celestial bodies exhibit deviations from spherical symmetry, including oblateness, localized mass concentrations, and higher-order shape irregularities. These features can significantly perturb spacecraft trajectories, especially in low-altitude or long-duration missions, leading to cumulative orbit prediction errors and increased control demands. This article presents a tutorial introduction to spherical harmonic gravity models, outlining their theoretical foundations and underlying assumptions. Higher-order gravitational fields are derived as solutions to the Laplace equation, providing a systematic framework to capture the effects of non-uniform mass distributions. The impact of these higher-order terms on orbital dynamics is illustrated through examples involving Low Earth Orbit satellites and spacecraft near irregularly shaped asteroids, highlighting the practical significance of moving beyond the point-mass approximation.",

Volnova 10 pages, 8 figures, submitted to Astronomy and Computing Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Separating turbulent fluctuations from coherent large-scale background flows is a fundamental challenge in the analysis of numerical simulations and astronomical observations. Traditional approaches to this problem commonly rely on decomposition-based techniques, including scale-based filtering methods such as Fourier or wavelet transforms, as well as adaptive methods like the Hilbert-Huang transformation. In realistic flows, however, coherent motions and turbulent fluctuations often overlap across a broad range of scales and interact nonlinearly, rendering any clear and unique separation inherently ambiguous, particularly in astrophysical settings where data are projected or sparsely sampled. In this work, we assess the robustness of AI-based turbulence-background separation using two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes simulations of decaying hydrodynamic turbulence. The simulations are initialized with a coherent background flow and divergence-free turbulent perturbations with a Kolmogorov-like power spectrum, and evolve without external forcing, providing a conservative physical testbed. A neural network trained exclusively on static synthetic images is applied to simulation snapshots at different evolutionary stages. We find that the model successfully recovers turbulent fluctuations during early and intermediate stages, when partial scale separation is preserved. At later stages, despite the substantial decay of turbulent energy and the resulting reduction in fluctuation strength, the model continues to recover visually and spectrally plausible turbulent structures and preserves inertial-range spectral scaling, demonstrating robust separation under increasingly challenging conditions. These results demonstrate the potential of applying AI models trained on static data to time-evolving turbulent flows, with direct implications for astrophysical and cosmological applications.",

Published in A&A, 705, A68 (2026) Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Astronomical observations at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths heavily depend on the amount of Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) in the atmosphere, directly affecting the sky transparency and degrading the quality of the signals received by radio telescopes. Predictions of PWV at different forecasting horizons is crucial to support telescope operations, engineering planning, and observational scheduling and efficiency of radio observatories installed in the Chajnantor area in northern Chile. We developed and validated a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning-based model to predict PWV at forecasting horizons of 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours using historical data from two 183 GHz radiometers and a weather station in the Chajnantor area. We find the LSTM method is able to predict PWV in the 12 and 24 hours forecasting horizons with Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 22% compared to 36% of the traditional Global Forecast System (GFS) method used by Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in mm are reduced by 50%. We present a first application of deep learning techniques for preliminary predictions of PWV in the Chajnantor area. The prediction performance shows significant improvements to traditional methods in 12 and 24 hours time windows. We also propose upgrades to improve our method in short (< 1 hour) and long (> 36 hours) forecasting timescales for future work.",

Errors in these measurements have significant implications, affecting the calculated pre-impact orbit, influencing mass estimates, and impacting the accuracy of dark flight simulations, where applicable. Here we implement a new atmospheric refraction correction technique that addresses a significant aspect previously overlooked in the field of meteor science. Traditional refraction correction techniques, originally designed for objects positioned at infinite distances, tend to overcompensate when applied to objects within the Earth's atmosphere. To rectify this issue, our study introduces the concept of the atmospheric refraction delta z correction technique, involving the artificial elevation of the observer site height above sea level. We utilize analytically derived formulas for the delta z correction in conjunction with commonly used refraction models, validating these results against a numerical solution that traces light rays through the atmosphere. This ray-tracing model is applied to finely meshed atmospheric layers, yielding precise correction values. We evaluate multiple sources of error in order to quantify the achievable accuracy of the proposed method. Our approach (1) enables the determination of fireball positions with improved astrometric accuracy, (2) removes the explicit dependence on the fireball distance from the observer or its height above Earth's surface within the limits imposed by realistic atmospheric variability, and (3) simplifies meteor data processing by providing a robust framework for analyzing low-elevation fireball observations, for which atmospheric refraction is significant and is automatically corrected by the method. As a result of this work, we provide open, publicly accessible software for calculating the delta z correction.",

The model links on-orbit generation (solar arrays and wall-plug to optical), terrain-masked visibility and range, beam propagation with realistic divergence and jitter, and surface conversion with thermal and dust limits, returning delivered daily energy. Baseline loads for early polar activities (habitat survival, mobility, comm/nav, pilot ISRU) set target W h/day and are used consistently in scaling laws and design maps. A near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) to a Shackleton-rim site provides a worked example: for a 2 m-class phased array at 1064 nm the reference geometry yields ~0.6-0.8 kW h/day to a 1m$^2$ receiver (about 28 W averaged over the day). We place this result in context by comparing on the same daily-energy metric to surface photovoltaics (PV) with storage and to compact fission, and by showing how delivered energy scales nearly linearly with transmit power and as $D_{\\rm eff}^2$ via encircled-energy capture, with a multiplicative gain from visibility (constellations). The same framework indicates practical regimes already within reach: e.g., a 10 m effective-aperture optical phased array at $P_{\\rm tx}=100$ kW delivers ~30-50 kW h/day at polar sites with typical single-orbiter visibility, as quantified by the delivered-energy and sizing maps. Thus, laser beaming is mass-competitive where darkness or permanent shadow forces deep storage for PV, or where distributed and duty-cycled users can amortize a shared transmitter; compact fission retains advantage for continuous multi-kW baseload at fixed sites.",

Smallwood, Min-Kai Lin, Chao-Chin Yang, Nicolás Cuello 19 pages, 17 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Stellar flybys are a common dynamical process in young stellar clusters and can significantly reshape protoplanetary discs. However, their impact on dust dynamics remains poorly understood, particularly in the weakly coupled regime (St$\\gg$1). We present three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of parabolic stellar flybys-both coplanar and inclined-interacting with a gaseous and dusty protoplanetary disc. Dust species with Stokes numbers ranging from 15 to 100, corresponding to four grain sizes under a uniform initial gas surface density, are included. Perturber masses of 0.1 and 1$\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ are considered. The induced spiral structures exhibit distinct dynamical behaviours in gas and dust: dust spirals retain a nearly constant pattern speed, while gas spirals gradually decelerate. The pitch angles of both components decrease over time, with dust evolving more rapidly. In the weakly coupled regime, gas and dust spirals are spatially offset, facilitating dust accumulation around both structures. Equal-mass flybys truncate the disc at approximately $\\sim$0.55$r_{\\mathrm{Hill}}$, producing tightly wound, ring-like spirals that promote dust concentration. By mapping the streaming instability growth rates in the solid abundance-Stokes number space across three evolutionary phases, we find that a low-mass flyby suppresses dust concentration below the critical clumping threshold after periastron and maintains this suppression over time, indicating long-lasting inhibition of dust clumping. An equal-mass flyby raises local solid abundance well above the threshold, suggesting that such encounters may foster conditions favourable for dust clumping. Flyby-induced spirals play a central role in shaping dust evolution, leading to distinct spatial and temporal behaviours in weakly coupled discs.",

Pravec Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The rotational properties of asteroids provide critical information about not only their internal structure but also their collisional and thermal histories. Previous work has revealed a bimodal distribution of asteroid spin rates, dividing populations into fast and slow rotators, but to date this separation remains poorly understood (e.g. its dependency on composition). We investigate whether the valley separating fast and slow rotators in rotational period-diameter space depends on the composition of the asteroid, approximated by asteroids' spectral class. First, we extended the Minor Planet Physical Properties Catalogue (MP3C) to include the available spectral classes of asteroids. Then, for each asteroid we selected the best diameter, rotational period, and spectral class. Building upon a semi-supervised machine-learning method, we quantify the valley between fast and slow rotators for S- and C-complex asteroids, which are linked to ordinary and carbonaceous chondrites respectively. The method iteratively fits a linear boundary between the two populations in rotational period-diameter space to maximise their separation. We find a clear compositional dependence of the valley: for C-complex asteroids the transition occurs at longer periods than for S-complex, with P* = 14.4 D_km^0.739 (C-complex) and P* = 11.6 D_km^0.718 (S-complex), where period and diameter are given in hours and kilometres respectively. This corresponds to mu Q approximately 2 and 13 GPa, respectively, where mu is the rigidity and Q the quality factor. The dependence of the valley on spectral classes likely reflects compositional and structural differences: C-complex asteroids, being more porous and weaker, dissipate angular momentum more efficiently than stronger, more coherent S-complex asteroids. This represents quantitative evidence of class-dependent rotational valleys within asteroid populations.",

Eriksson, Hongping Deng, Bin Liu, Ping Chen 15 pages, 9 figures; accepted for publication in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The formation of planetesimals via the streaming instability (SI) is a crucial step in planet formation, yet its triggering conditions and efficiency are highly sensitive to both disk properties and specific evolutionary processes. We aim to study the planetesimal formation via the SI, driven by the stellar X-ray photoevaporation during the late stages of disk dispersal, and quantify its dependence on key disk and stellar parameters. We use the DustPy code to simulate the dust dynamics including coagulation, fragmentation, and radial drift in a viscously accreting disk undergoing stellar X-ray photoevaporation. Stellar X-rays drive the disk dispersal, opening a cavity at a few au orbital distance and inducing the formation of an associated local pressure maximum. This pressure maximum acts as a trap for radially drifting dust, therefore enhancing the dust density to the critical level required to initiate the streaming instability and the subsequent collapse into planetesimals. The fiducial model produces 31.4 M_\\oplus of planetesimals with an initial dust to final planetesimal conversion efficiency of 20.4%. This pathway is most efficient in larger disks with higher metallicities, lower viscosities, higher dust fragmentation threshold velocities, and/or around stars with higher X-ray luminosities. This work demonstrates that stellar X-ray photoevaporation is a robust and feasible mechanism for triggering planetesimal formation via the SI during the final clearing phase of protoplanetary disk evolution.",

      "abstract": "Possible favored Great Oxidation Event scenario on exoplanets around M-Stars with the example of TRAPPIST-1e Adam Y. Jaziri, Nathalie Carrasco, Benjamin Charnay Accepted in Nature Scientific Report Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The Great Oxidation Event (GOE), which marked the transition from an anoxic to an oxygenated atmosphere, occurred 2.4 billion years ago on Earth, several hundreds of millions of years after the emergence of oxygenic photosynthesis. This long delay implies that specific conditions in terms of biomass productivity and burial were necessary to trigger the GOE. It could be a limiting factor for the development of oxygenated atmospheres on inhabited exoplanets. In this study, we explore the specificities of a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone of an M dwarf for a GOE. Using a 1D coupled photochemical-climate model, we simulate the atmospheric evolution of TRAPPIST-1 e, an Earth-like exoplanet, exploring the effect of oxygen sources (biotic or abiotic). Our results show that the stellar energy distribution promotes O3 production at lower O2 concentrations compared to Earth, and the ozone layer on TRAPPIST-1 e forms more efficiently. This lowers the threshold for atmospheric oxidation, suggesting that the GOE on TRAPPIST-1 e would occur quickly after the rise of oxygenic photosynthesis, up to 1Gyrs earlier than on Earth, and would reach O2 enabling oxygenic respiration and thus the development of animals. We may question whether this is a general behavior around several M-stars. Furthermore, we discuss how the overproduction of ozone could make O3 detection possible using the James Webb Space Telescope, providing a potential method to observe oxygenation signatures on exoplanets in the near future. Previous studies predicted that for an Earth-like atmosphere O3 would require over 150 transits for detection, but our results show that significantly fewer transits could be needed.",

In compact multiplanetary systems, secular spin-orbital resonance may preserve high obliquities and asynchronous rotation even for tidally-despinning, low-mass planets, potentially leading to unique atmospheric circulation patterns. To understand the impact on the atmospheric circulation and to identify the potential atmospheric observational signatures of such high-obliquity planets, we simulate the three dimensional circulation of a representative mini-Neptune K2-290 b, whose obliquity may reach about 67 degrees. Whether synchronously rotating or not, the planet's slow rotation, moderate temperature and radius result in a global Weak-Temperature-Gradient (WTG) behavior with moderate horizontal temperature contrasts. Under synchronous rotation, broad eastward superrotating jets efficiently redistribute heat. Circulation in an asynchronous rotation exhibits a seasonal cycle driven by high obliquity, along with quasi-periodic oscillations in winds and temperatures with a period of about 70 orbital periods. These oscillations, driven by wave-mean flow interactions, extend from low to mid-latitudes due to the slow planetary rotation. Higher atmospheric metallicity strengthens radiative forcing, increasing temperature contrasts and jet speeds. Clouds have minimal impact under synchronous rotation but weaken jets under nonsynchronous rotation by reducing temperature contrasts. In all cases, both thermal emission and transmission spectra exhibit moderate observational signals at a level of 100 ppm, and high-obliquity effects contribute differences at the 10 ppm level. Our results are also applicable to a range of potential high-obliquity exoplanets, which reside in the WTG regime and likely exhibit nearly homogeneous horizontal temperature patterns.",

Wogan, Suvrath Mahadevan, Sagnick Mukherjee Submitted to AAS Journals (26 pages) Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Sub-Neptune planets are often modeled with a dense rocky or metal-rich interior beneath a thick hydrogen/helium (H/He) atmosphere; though their bulk densities could also be explained by a water-rich interior with a thin H/He atmosphere. Atmospheric composition provides a key mechanism to break this degeneracy between competing interior models. However, the overall composition of sub-Neptunes inferred from spectra obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope, remains debated in part due to differences in modeling assumptions. While previous studies explored parameter spaces such as stellar spectra, atmospheric metallicities, and carbon-to-oxygen ratios, they often assumed fixed intrinsic temperatures (Tint) and vertical eddy diffusion coefficients (Kzz) - two critical, yet poorly constrained, drivers of atmospheric chemistry. To address this, we present a self-consistent grid of models that covers the full plausible range of Tint (60 - 450 K) and Kzz (10^{5} - 10^{12} cm^2/s) using the open-source PICASO and VULCAN packages to better characterize sub-Neptune atmospheres. Focusing on K2-18b analogs, we demonstrate that Tint and Kzz significantly impact CH4, CO2, CO, NH3 and HCN abundances, with H2O being largely unaffected. Our work demonstrates that comprehensive parameter space exploration of thermal and mixing parameters is essential for accurate interpretation of sub-Neptune spectra, and that single-parameter assumptions can lead to misclassification of planetary interiors. We provide a diagnostic framework using multi-molecule observations to distinguish between competing atmospheric models and advance robust characterization of sub-Neptunes.",

Tan, Kathryn Volk, Mike Alexandersen, Jean-Marc Petit 20 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in PSJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The Colours of the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (Col-OSSOS) measured the optical/NIR colours of a brightness-complete sample of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs). Like previous surveys, this one found a bimodal colour distribution in TNOs, categorised as red and very red. Additionally, this survey proposed an alternative surface classification scheme: FaintIR and BrightIR. Cold classical TNOs mostly have very red or FaintIR surfaces, while dynamically excited TNOs show a mixture of surfaces. This likely indicates that formation locations and proximity to the Sun influenced surface characteristics and color changes. Our study combines the data from Col-OSSOS with two dynamical models describing the formation of the Kuiper belt during Neptune's migration. We investigate the proposed surface-colour changing line and explore the distribution of different surfaces within the primordial disk. By comparing radial colour transitions across various scenarios, we explore the origins of surface characteristics and their implications within the context of BrightIR and FaintIR classifications. Moreover, we extend our analysis to examine the distribution of these surface classes within the present-day Kuiper Belt, providing insights into the configuration of the early solar system's planetesimal disk prior to giant planet migration. We find that the most likely primordial disk compositions are inner neutral / outer red (with transition $30.0^{+1.1}_{-1.2}$ au), or inner BrightIR / outer FaintIR (with transition $31.5^{+1.1}_{-1.2}$ au).",

Wolf 18 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables, AJ in press, author's version; abstract has been slightly modified for clarity Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Future direct-imaging missions such as the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) aim to observe thermal emission from potentially habitable planets to characterize their surface environments and search for signs of life. Previous studies of directly imaged Earth-like planets have mainly examined the signatures of atmospheric composition, often using 1D models, while the effect of horizontal temperature gradients has received limited attention. Because a pronounced horizontal temperature gradient may signal the absence of a global ocean, we investigate its detectability through thermal-emission direct imaging. Adopting Teegarden's Star b (zero-albedo equilibrium temperature ~280 K) as a benchmark, we compute 3D atmospheric structures with and without a global ocean using the ROCKE-3D general circulation model and simulate geometry-dependent thermal emission spectra. We show that the temperature gradients that disfavor a global-ocean scenario manifest in both orbital phase variation and spectral shape of the snapshot spectra. The phase variation is more readily detectable: one-day integrations with LIFE at two orbital phases would reveal flux variations in no-ocean cases with 1-10 bar atmospheres, depending on background atmospheric composition. Shapshot spectra provide complementary diagnostics, including the running brightness temperature of the continuum and detailed absorption band shapes, but detecting these features requires longer integration times. These 3D effects, if neglected, can bias interpretations based on 1D models, and could also lead to misidentification of the H$_2$O band beyond 10 $\\mu$m. We also assess the detectability of these 3D effects on other nearby planets. Our results highlight the need to incorporate 3D atmospheric structures when characterizing rocky exoplanets, both to constrain surface conditions and to avoid misinterpretation of spectral data.",

      "abstract": "Timescales diagnostics for saving viscous and MHD-driven dusty discs from external photoevaporation Gabriele Pichierri, Giovanni Rosotti, Rossella Anania, Giuseppe Lodato Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The evolution of protoplanetary discs is a function of their internal processes and of their environment. It is unclear if angular momentum is mainly removed viscously or by magnetic winds, or by a combination of the two. While external photoevaporation is expected to influence disc evolution and dispersal, there are observational limitations towards highly irradiated discs. The interplay between these ingredients and their effect on the gas and dust distributions are poorly understood. We investigate the evolution of both the gaseous and solid components of viscous, MHD-wind or hybrid discs, in combination with external FUV-driven mass loss. We test which combinations of parameters protect discs from external irradiation, allowing the solid component to live long enough to allow planet formation to succeed. We run a suite of 1D simulations of smooth discs with varying initial sizes, levels of viscous and MHD-wind stresses modelled via an $\\alpha$ parametrisation, and strengths of the external FUV environment. We track disc radii, various lifetime diagnostics, and the amount of dust removed by the photoevaporative wind, as a function of the underlying parameters. The biggest role in determining the fate of discs is played by a combination of its ability to spread radially outwards and the strength of FUV-driven erosion. While MHD wind-driven discs experience less FUV erosion due to the lack of spread, they do not live for longer compared to viscously evolving discs, especially at low-to-moderate FUV fluxes, while higher fluxes yield disc lifetimes that are insensitive to the disc's angular momentum transport mechanism. For the solid component, the biggest role is played by a combination of inward drift and removal by FUV winds. This points to the importance of other physical ingredients, such as disc substructures, even in highly-irradiated disc regions, in order to retain solids.",
