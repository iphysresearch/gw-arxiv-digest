Mercurio, M. D'Addona 18 pages plus appendix, 11 figures, submitted to JCAP Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate the anisotropic stress parameter, $\\eta=\\Psi/\\Phi$, defined as the ratio of the gravitational potentials in the linearly perturbed Friedmann-Lemaître Robertson-Walker metric, as a probe of deviations from general relativity across astrophysical to cosmological scales. Using mass profiles reconstructed from high-precision lensing and kinematics of nine galaxy clusters from the CLASH-VLT sample, we derive $\\eta(r)$ as a function of the radial distance from the cluster centres, over the range $[0.1 \\,\\text{Mpc},1.2\\,r_{200}^L]$, where $r_{200}^L$ is virial radius best-fit from lensing data. When using a Navarro-Frenk-White or an Hernquist profile to model the total matter distribution, we find consistency with general relativity ($\\eta = 1$) within $2\\sigma$ for the full radial range for all the sampled clusters. However, adopting a Burkert profile introduces mild tension with general relativity, reaching the $3\\sigma$ level in two systems. Assuming a negligible time-dependence in the redshift range spawned by the clusters, we obtain the joint constraint $\\eta (r= 1.0 \\, \\text{Mpc}) = 0.93^{+0.48}_{-0.40}$ (stat) $\\pm 0.47$ (syst) at $95\\% $ confidence level -- an improvement of approximately $40\\%$ over previous estimates. We discuss the impact of systematics on the constraints, and we highlight the implications of this result for current and upcoming cluster surveys.",

      "abstract": "Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate the evolution of primordial cosmological perturbations in a vacuum decay model where de Sitter space transitions to radiation domination through quantum-thermal decay processes. Unlike standard inflation, this framework generates curvature perturbations through stochastic noise from vacuum decay rather than quantum fluctuations of an inflaton field. We derive the stochastic differential equation governing the curvature perturbation $\\mathcal{R}(t)$ and show that any horizon crossing is brief and does not constitute the primary mechanism for perturbation generation. Scale dependence emerges from spatial correlations in the noise rather than horizon crossing dynamics. The model naturally addresses the horizon and flatness problems through initial thermal equilibrium in de Sitter space and predicts zero tensor-to-scalar ratio. We demonstrate that spatially correlated noise can generate observationally viable spectral tilts while maintaining Gaussian statistics.",

Sutherland, A. Einstein, and independently by Yu.S. Vladimirov, are discussed in the paper. According to this hypothesis, the electric charges of the electron and proton slightly differ in magnitude, leading to the emergence of a magnetic field in rotating astrophysical objects. The theoretical justification of the Sutherland-Einstein hypothesis is presented in a simplified version of the 6D Kaluza-Klein theory, taking into account the consequences of the Kerr-Newman metric. The analysis shows that a fundamental dipole-type magnetic field should arise around any massive rotating body. However, in real astrophysical objects, such a field is largely screened and distorted by induced charges and currents. As an application, we consider the problem of determining the magnetic fields of hot Jupiters, since the strong tidal effects in these giant exoplanets should result in approximately similar screening mechanisms.",

Some of these events have also been potentially associated with transient electromagnetic flares, indicating that BBH mergers in dense environments may be promising sources of multi-messenger signals. To investigate the prospects for electromagnetic emission from these systems, we study the dynamics of accretion flows onto BBHs embedded in AGN disks using numerical simulations. Although recent studies have explored this scenario, they often employ simplified disk models that neglect magnetic fields. In this work, we examine how strong magnetic fields influence and regulate the accretion onto such binary systems. In this context, we conduct three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical local shearing-box simulations of a binary black hole system embedded within a magnetized disk of an AGN. We observe that the dynamically important magnetic fields can drive the formation of well-collimated outflows capable of penetrating the vertical extent of the AGN disk. However, outflow generation is not ubiquitous and strongly depends on the radial distance of the binary from the supermassive black hole (SMBH). In particular, binaries placed at a larger distance from the central SMBH show relatively more transient accretion and the formation of stronger spiral shocks. Furthermore, accretion behavior onto the binary system via individual circum-singular disks (CSDs) is also modulated by local AGN disk properties. Our simulations highlight the importance of shear velocity in the amplification of the toroidal magnetic field component, which plays a crucial role in governing the outflow strength.",

Published in RMPP Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) Space-borne gravitational wave detections raise new questions for heliophysics: how the Sun-Terrestrial space environment affect gravitational wave detection, and to what extent? Space-borne gravitational wave detectors use laser interferometry to measure displacement variations between two free test masses caused by gravitational waves. Space-borne gravitational wave detectors require extremely high measurement accuracy, making it necessary to take into account the effects of space plasma and magnetic field. On one hand, laser propagation through space plasma can induce optical path difference noise, affecting distance measurement accuracy. On the other hand, interactions between space magnetic field and the test masses can generate acceleration noise. This review introduces studies on laser propagation noise and space magnetic acceleration noise in space gravitational wave detection. And this review presents a method, time-delay interferometry, to suppress laser propagation noise.",

Comments are welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy is a one-parameter extension of the standard HDE framework, in which the horizon entropy is reformulated using Kaniadakis entropy. At the cosmological level, it has been shown to give rise to modified Friedmann equations, leading to a richer phenomenology compared to $\\Lambda$CDM. In this work we test the Kanadiakis holography model against multiple late-time observational probes, including Type Ia supernovae from PantheonPlus and Union3, Cosmic Chronometer measurements of the Hubble parameter and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2). Using a Bayesian inference approach with MCMC methods, we constrain the cosmological parameters of the model and evaluate its performance against $\\Lambda$CDM through the Akaike Information Criterion. We find that Kaniadakis holography can provide a better fit for some data combinations, although $\\Lambda$CDM remains slightly statistically favored overall. These results highlight Kaniadakis holography as a competitive alternative to the standard cosmological model, offering valuable insights into the role of generalized entropy in dark energy dynamics.",

Ferreira, Carlos García-García Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Current cosmological data seem to show that dark energy is evolving in time and that it possibly crossed the phantom divide in the past. So far the only theories that lead to such a behavior involve a non-trivial coupling between dark energy, in the form of a scalar field, and the gravitational or matter sector. We show that there is another possibility involving both a non-trivial kinetic sector in a cubic Galileon theory and a scalar field potential that breaks the Galileon shift symmetry, which can lead to a similar phenomenology on large scales. We perform a full Bayesian analysis using the latest cosmological data, including DESI DR2 BAO measurements, type Ia SNe measurements from DESY5, Union3, and Pantheon+, and CMB data from Planck and ACT. We find that it is statistically strongly favored over a Universe dominated by a cosmological constant (with a Bayes factor of $\\log B\\simeq 6.5$). Yet, as with other non-minimally coupled theories, it has severe ancillary gravitational effects. These can be mitigated to some extent, but as with other viable theories, the penalty is ever more elaborate scalar field models of dark energy.",

We assess the usability of neural likelihood for GW parameter estimation and report the parameter space where neural likelihood performs as a robust estimator to output posterior probability distributions using modest computational resources. In addition, we demonstrate that the trained Neural likelihood can also be used in further analysis, enabling us to obtain the evidence corresponding to a hypothesis, making our method a complete tool for parameter estimation. Particularly, our method requires around 100 times fewer likelihood evaluations than standard Bayesian algorithms to infer properties of a GW signal from a binary black hole system as observed by current generation ground-based detectors. The fairly simple neural network architecture chosen makes for cheap training, which allows our method to be used on-the-fly without the need for special hardware and ensures our method is flexible to use any waveform model, noise model, or prior. We show results from simulations as well as results from GW150914 as proof of the effectiveness of our algorithm.",

Here, we first update the computation of the entropy associated with various sectors of the observed universe, including in the diffuse cosmic and late-time gamma-ray and neutrino backgrounds, in baryonic matter both in diffuse components, in stars and stellar remnants, and in cosmic rays; we then update, crucially, the estimate of entropy in stellar-mass and super-massive black holes, whose abundance and mass function has come into increasingly sharp definition with recent observations and with the rapidly growing statistics of black-hole-black-hole mergers observed with gravity wave detectors. We also provide a new, corrected estimate of the potential entropy associated with a stochastic gravitational wave background, with dark sector radiations, and with several dark matter models. Finally, we utilize the similarly recently updated constraints on the abundance of hypothetical primordial black holes - black holes, that is, of non-stellar origin - to assess the maximal amount entropy they could store. We find that if supermassive primordial black holes exist, they can dominate the entropy budget of the universe consistently with current constraints on their abundance and mass function, to a level potentially not distant from the posited entropy associated with the cosmic event horizon of de Sitter spacetime. The same conclusion holds for certain dark sector models featuring a large number of dark degrees of freedom.",

We calibrate the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch $r_d$ to the Planck value, ensuring consistency with early-universe physics. With the reconstructed cosmic distances and their derivatives, we obtain seven characteristic redshifts in the range $0.3 \\leq z \\leq 1.7$. We derive the normalized expansion rate of the Universe $E(z)$ at these redshifts. Our findings reveal significant deviations of approximately $4$ to $5\\sigma$ from the Planck 2018 $\\Lambda$CDM predictions, particularly pronounced in the redshift range $z \\sim 0.35-0.55$. These anomalies are consistently observed across both reconstruction methods and combined datasets, indicating robust late-time tensions in the expansion rate of the Universe and which are distinct from the existing \"Hubble Tension\". This could signal new physics beyond the standard cosmological framework at this redshift range. Our findings underscore the role of characteristic redshifts as sensitive indicators of expansion rate anomalies and motivate further scrutiny with forthcoming datasets from DESI-5YR BAO, Euclid, and LSST. These future surveys will tighten constraints and will confirm whether these late-time anomalies arise from new fundamental physics or unresolved systematics in the data.",

Gravitational wave observations have recently emerged as a powerful tool to test the existence and properties of PBHs, as these objects leave distinctive imprints on the gravitational waveform. Notably, there are no known astrophysical processes that can form sub-solar mass black holes, making their discovery a compelling signal of new physics. In addition to PBHs, we consider other exotic compact object (ECO) candidates-such as strange quark stars and boson stars-which can produce similar gravitational signatures and potentially mimic PBHs. In this work, we employ the Fisher matrix formalism to explore a broad parameter space, including binary masses, spins, and a variety of nuclear and quark matter equations of state. Our goal is to assess the ability of next-generation gravitational wave detectors-specifically Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope-to distinguish PBHs from ECOs, stellar BHs and neutron stars. We compute the maximum luminosity distances at which confident ($\\geq 3\\sigma$) detections of sub-solar masses or tidal effects are possible, providing quantitative benchmarks for PBH identification or exclusion under various observational scenarios. Our results indicate that next-generation detectors will be capable of probing sub-solar mass PBHs out to cosmological distances of $z \\sim 3$. For heavier objects with masses up to $M \\lesssim 2 M_\\odot$, we show that PBHs can be distinguished from neutron stars via their lack of tidal effects up to redshifts of $z \\sim 0.2$.",

The future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect thousands of these systems, and they are predicted to be the most numerous science targets of the mission. We develop a strategy to identify LISA source candidates in multiband photometric surveys. We constructed a synthetic EM catalogue of white dwarf (WD) detections based on a population synthesis code combined with a semi-analytical model of the Milky Way and a consistent cooling model for the evolution. We compared sources in the LISA band with other WD observations in magnitude-colour and colour-colour plots. From a full sky survey with $u \\le$24.5, we find that 57$\\%$ of the sources in the LISA band occupy a specific region in colour-colour diagrams. Inside this area, we find that $\\sim 63\\%$ (6.5 $\\times 10^4$) of EM observations are LISA candidates, $\\sim 31\\%$ ($ 3.2 \\times 10^4$) are DWDs slightly outside the LISA frequency range, and only a small contamination comes from single WDs and wider binaries. We find that the colour distributions of close DWDs represent a powerful tool to distinguish potential LISA sources from the broader WD population. This is an avenue to select candidates for further follow-up and identification.",

Submitted to PRL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas, merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets. Here we report on a numerical simulation that covers the late inspiral, merger, and initial postmerger phase of such a system where both black holes have the same mass and spin, and both spin axes are parallel to the orbital angular momentum. The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau. Such a distinct lightcurve should aid efforts to identify supermassive black hole mergers, with or without accompanying gravitational wave detections.",

We account for this effect via a new Bayesian estimator, based on the negative binomial distribution. Combining the two best understood wide-area surveys, NVSS and RACS-low, and the deepest wide-area survey, LoTSS-DR2, we find that the source count dipole exceeds its expected value as the kinematic dipole amplitude from standard cosmology by a factor of $3.67 \\pm 0.49$ -- a $5.4\\sigma$ discrepancy.",

However, severe challenges to the phenomenological $\\Lambda$CDM model have emerged recently, including the Hubble constant tension and the significant deviation from the $\\Lambda$CDM model reported by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration. Despite many explanations for the two challenges have been proposed, the origins of them are still intriguing mysteries. Here, we investigate the DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) measurements to interpret the Hubble constant tension. Employing a non-parametric method, we find that the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ evolves with redshift from DESI BAO data and type Ia supernovae. From the Friedmann equations, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) is derived from $w(z)$ model-independently. We find that the values of $H_0$ show a descending trend as a function of redshift, and can effectively resolve the Hubble constant tension. Our study finds that the two unexpected challenges to the $\\Lambda$CDM model can be understood in one physical framework, e.g., dynamical dark energy.",

      "abstract": "Challenges of standard halo models in constraining galaxy properties from CIB anisotropies Athanasia Gkogkou, Guilaine Lagache, Matthieu Béthermin, Abhishek Maniyar Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The halo model, combined with halo occupation distribution (HOD) prescriptions, is widely used to interpret cosmic infrared background (CIB) anisotropies and connect star-forming galaxies to large-scale structure. Recent implementations adopt more physical parameterizations, but it remains unclear whether these models reliably recover astrophysical quantities. We test whether current CIB halo models can constrain the star formation efficiency, $\\eta(M_h,z)$, and the halo mass where it peaks, $M_{\\rm max}$, when fitted to mock data. We examine whether discrepancies arise from emission assumptions (the HOD ingredients) or from more fundamental components, such as bias and matter clustering. Using the M21 CIB HOD model within the halo framework, we fit mock CIB power spectra and star formation rate density (SFRD) data from the SIDES-Uchuu simulation, then repeat the analysis with a simplified simulation (SSU) matched to the HOD assumptions. Comparing best-fit parameters to known inputs, we find that although the M21 model fits the mock data well, it fails to recover intrinsic parameters, especially $M_{\\rm max}$, even when applied to data generated with consistent assumptions. Emission-related quantities (SFRD, emissivity) agree within 5%, but the two-halo term shows a redshift- and scale-dependent offset exceeding 20%, likely due to the linear treatment of halo bias and matter clustering. Scatter in the SFR-halo mass relation and spectral energy distributions significantly impacts shot noise ($\\sim 50\\%$) but only modestly ($<10\\%$) the clustered signal. We conclude that robust recovery of physical parameters from CIB clustering requires improved cosmological ingredients in halo models, including scale-dependent halo bias and nonlinear matter power spectra, alongside refined emission modeling.",

Our principal aim is to advance the mapping of the cosmic web at high redshifts using observational and synthetic catalogues of quasars (QSOs), which offer a powerful probe of structure formation and the validity of the concordance cosmological model. In this analysis, we selected 708,483 QSOs at $0.8<z<2.2$ from the Quaia data set, allowing a reconstruction of the matter density field using 24,372 deg$^2$ sky area with a well-understood selection function, and thus going beyond previous studies. Using the REVOLVER method, we created catalogues of voids and clusters based on the estimation of the local density at QSO positions with Voronoi tessellation. We tested the consistency of Quaia data and 50 mock catalogues, including various parameters of the voids and clusters in data subsets, and also measurements of the density profiles of these cosmic super-structures at $100 h^{-1}$Mpc scales. We identified 12,842 voids and 41,111 clusters in the distribution of Quaia QSOs. The agreement between data and mocks is at a level of 5-10%, considering void and cluster radii, average inner density, and density profiles. In particular, we tested the role of survey mask proximity effects in the void and cluster detection, which albeit present, are consistent in simulations and observations. The largest voids and clusters reach $R_{eff} \\approx 250 h^{-1}$Mpc and $150 h^{-1}$Mpc, respectively, but without evidence for ultra-large cosmic structures exceeding the dimensions of the largest structures in the mocks. As an important deliverable, we share our density field estimation, void catalogues, and cluster catalogues with the public, allowing various additional cross-correlation probes at high-z.",

Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate the origin and formation mechanisms of the intra-cluster light (ICL) in The Three Hundred simulations, a set of 324 hydrodynamically resimulated massive galaxy clusters. The ICL, a diffuse component of stars not bound to individual galaxies, serves as a key tracer of cluster formation and evolution. Using two hydrodynamics implementations, Gadget-X and Gizmo-Simba, we identify the stellar particles comprising the ICL at z=0 and trace them back in time to the moments when they were formed and accreted into the ICL. Across our 324 clusters, half of the present-day ICL mass is typically in place between $z \\sim $ 0.2 and 0.5. The main ICL formation channel is the stripping of stars from subhalos after their infall into the host cluster. Within this channel, 65-80 per cent of the ICL comes from objects with stellar (infall) masses above $10^{11}$ M$_\\odot$, i.e., massive galaxies, groups and clusters. Considering the ratio of the infalling halo to the total cluster mass, a median of 35 per cent of the mass is brought in major merger events, though this percentage varies significantly across clusters (15-55 per cent). Additional contributions come from minor mergers (25-35 per cent) and smooth accretion (20-50 per cent). The primary contributors typically infall at $z \\leq 1$, with smaller fractions arriving at redshifts between 1 and 2. Regarding other formation channels, we find minor contributions from stars formed in subhalos after their infall and stars stripped while their contributing halo remains outside the host cluster (and can eventually fall inside or stay outside). Finally, for our two sets of simulations, we find medians of 12 (Gadget-X) and 2 (Gizmo-Simba) per cent of the ICL mass formed in-situ, that is, directly as part of the diffuse component. However, this component can be attributed to stripping of gas in high-velocity infalling satellite galaxies.",

In the last decade, there has been significant progress in our understanding of the cosmic history of extragalactic emissions associated with stellar evolution and accretion onto supermassive black holes, largely enabled by the extensive body of multi-wavelength data. The brightness of the extragalactic sky is now measured in photons, neutrinos, and cosmic rays, using observatories on the ground, in the sea, and in the ice, satellites in Earth orbit, and probes at the edge of the solar system. This wealth of disparate data is essential to unraveling the mysteries of the source populations that contribute to the extragalactic background. In this contribution, we present an open database containing the most comprehensive collection of measurements of the extragalactic background spectrum to date. The combination of multi-messenger measurements over 27 frequency decades allows us to estimate the energy density of most extragalactic background components with an uncertainty of less than 30%. We explore the consistency of this cosmic inventory of the observed fields of relativistic particles populating the Universe with the cosmic history of star formation and accretion around supermassive black holes. Models incorporating these cosmic histories, as well as the redshift-dependent luminosity functions of extragalactic sources, currently match the electromagnetic component of the extragalactic background spectrum over 14 frequency decades, from the near UV to sub-TeV gamma rays. The knowledge gained from synthetic population models in the electromagnetic bands may become a crucial tool for understanding the origin of the most energetic extragalactic messengers, neutrinos and ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays.",

Comments welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate how the star formation activity of galaxies depends on their position within the cosmic web using the SIMBA cosmological simulation from redshift $z=3$ to $z=0$. While previous studies found that galaxies closer to filaments tend to be more massive and quenched, it remained unclear whether these trends reflect intrinsic environmental effects or changes in the galaxy population mix. To address this, we focus exclusively on star-forming galaxies, robustly selected using both the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and gas depletion timescale criteria, in order to isolate the direct impact of the cosmic web on star-forming galaxies. We reconstruct the 3D cosmic web skeleton using DisPerSE and compute each galaxy's distance to its nearest filament. After removing mass dependencies, we examine deviations in star formation rate (SFR), sSFR, molecular and atomic gas depletion timescales, and gas fractions as a function of this distance. We find a clear and redshift-dependent modulation of star formation with filament proximity: at high redshift ($z \\gtrsim 2$), galaxies closer to filaments show enhanced SFR and gas accretion, reflecting efficient filament-fed growth. At $z=0$, we observe a V-shaped trend in the sSFR and depletion timescales, with minima at intermediate distances ($\\sim 0.25$ cMpc) and a surprising upturn very close to the filament cores, suggesting a resumed accretion in the densest environments. These effects are not driven by mergers and are primarily associated with satellite galaxies at low redshift. Our results demonstrate that large-scale cosmic web proximity modulates star formation in star-forming galaxies through a combination of gas supply regulation and environmental processing, with different mechanisms dominating across cosmic time.",

These observations are part of an ongoing effort to build a large, spectroscopically confirmed sample of strong lensing systems for studies on dark matter, galaxy structure, and cosmology. Our MUSE program targets both lens and source redshifts, with particular emphasis on southern hemisphere systems. MUSE's wide spectral coverage and integral field capability allow for efficient identification of multiple sources, lens environments, and weak spectral features. Redshifts for lenses and sources were obtained via manual identification of spectral features in extracted 1D spectra. Our dataset includes systems with complex configurations, such as multiple source planes and group or cluster-scale environments. We extracted and analyzed 185 spectra, successfully determining both the lens and the source redshifts for 48 gravitational lens systems. For an additional 21 targets, we measured the redshifts of the lenses but were unable to determine the redshifts of the background sources. Six targets were confirmed to not be gravitational lenses. The results presented here complement space-based imaging from our HST SNAPshot program and spectroscopic follow-up with DESI and Keck, and have lasting legacy value for identifying interesting high-redshift sources and complex lensing configurations.",

Submitted Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present spectroscopic data of strong lenses and their source galaxies using the Keck Near-Infrared Echellette Spectrometer (NIRES) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), providing redshifts necessary for nearly all strong-lensing applications with these systems, especially the extraction of physical parameters from lensing modeling. These strong lenses were found in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys using Residual Neural Networks (ResNet) and followed up by our Hubble Space Telescope program, with all systems displaying unambiguous lensed arcs. With NIRES, we target eight lensed sources at redshifts difficult to measure in the optical range and determine the source redshifts for six, between $z_s$ = 1.675 and 3.332. DESI observed one of the remaining source redshifts, as well as an additional source redshift within the six systems. The two systems with non-detections by NIRES were observed for a considerably shorter 600s at high airmass. Combining NIRES infrared spectroscopy with optical spectroscopy from our DESI Strong Lensing Secondary Target Program, these results provide the complete lens and source redshifts for six systems, a resource for refining automated strong lens searches in future deep- and wide-field imaging surveys and addressing a range of questions in astrophysics and cosmology.",

Pober Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det) The 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is a powerful probe of the evolution of the Universe. However, accurate measurements of the EoR signal from radio interferometric observations are sensitive to efficient foreground removal, mitigating radio-frequency interference and accounting for instrumental systematics. This work represents the first in a series of papers, where we will be introducing a novel ML based pipeline, step-by-step, to directly infer reionization parameters from 21-cm radio-interferometric images. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the variations in the point spread function (PSF) on parameter estimation by simulating visibilities corresponding to input 21-cm maps as observed by the 128-antenna configuration of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) Phase II. These visibilities are imaged to obtain dirty images, which are then used to train a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict $\\rm x_{HI}$. To systematically assess the effect of PSF mis-modelling, we generate multiple test sets by varying the MWA's antenna layout, thereby introducing controlled variations in the PSF; we then feed these alternative PSF dirty images to our CNN trained using only dirty images with the PSF of the true antenna layout. Our results demonstrate that PSF variations introduce biases in the CNN's predictions of $\\rm x_{HI}$, with errors depending on the extent of PSF distortion. We quantify these biases and discuss their implications for the reliability of machine-learning-based parameter inference in 21-cm cosmology and how they can be utilized to improve the robustness of estimation against PSF-related systematics in future 21-cm surveys. In concluding, we also discuss how this approach to incorporating realistic instrument error into an ML analysis pipeline can be expanded to include multiple other effects.",

Submitted to PRD Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present a study of unbiased reconstruction of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization maps from data collected by modern ground-based observatories. Atmospheric emission is a major source of correlated noise in such experiments, complicating the recovery of faint cosmological signals. We consider estimators that require minimal assumptions about unpolarized atmospheric emission properties, instead exploiting hardware solutions commonly implemented in modern instruments, such as pairs of orthogonal antennas in each focal plane pixel, and polarization signal modulation via a continuously rotating half-wave plate (HWP). We focus on two techniques: (i) statistical down-weighting of low-frequency atmospheric signals, and (ii) pair-differencing (PD), which involves differencing signals collected by two detectors in the same focal plane pixel. We compare their performance against the idealized case where the atmospheric signal is perfectly known and cleanly subtracted. We show that PD can be derived from maximum likelihood principles under general assumptions about the atmospheric signal, optimizing map sensitivity. In the absence of instrumental systematics but with reasonable detector noise variations, PD yields polarized sky maps with noise levels only slightly worse than the ideal case. While down-weighting could match this performance, it requires highly accurate atmospheric models that are not readily available. PD performance is affected by instrumental systematics, particularly those leaking atmospheric signal to the difference time stream. However, effects like gain mismatch are efficiently mitigated by a rotating HWP, making PD a competitive, robust, and efficient solution for CMB polarization mapmaking without atmospheric modeling.",

The X-ray emitting region is far too small to be directly imaged, but rapid variability of the X-ray signal can be used to infer the geometry by measuring time lags caused by material propagating towards the black hole and by coronal X-rays reflecting off the disk to imprint a reverberation lag. Reverberation lags can be recognized by characteristic spectral features, including an iron emission line at $\\sim 6.4$ keV and a broad Compton hump peaking at $\\sim 30$ keV. These reverberation features have both previously been detected for a few supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, it is much more challenging to detect reverberation lags from stellar-mass black holes because they are more than a million times smaller. Previous reverberation lag measurements for stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems have thus been limited to energies below 10 keV. Here we report on the first detection of the Compton hump reverberation feature from an X-ray binary, achieved by measuring lags in the broad energy range of $\\sim 1-150$ keV. The accompanying detection of an iron line feature confirms the scenario of X-ray reverberation and provides strong evidence that the accretion flows in AGNs and X-ray binaries are governed by an ubiquitous process. Reverberation lags are prominent only in the most rapid variability, whereas lags in the slower variability are commonly attributed to propagating mass accretion rate perturbations. Our lag measurements up to the highest energy to date reveal that this lag in the slower variability evolves dramatically on timescales of days.",

Last version here includes minor typo corrections Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The change of physical conditions across the turbulent and magnetized interstellar medium (ISM) induces a 3D spatial variation of the properties of Galactic polarized emission. The observed signal results from the averaging of different spectral energy distributions (SED) and polarization angles, along and between lines of sight. As a consequence, the total Stokes parameters $Q$ and $U$ will have different distorted SEDs, so that the polarization angle becomes frequency dependent. In the present work, we show how this phenomenon similarly induces a different distorted SED for the three polarized angular power spectra $EE$, $BB$ and $EB$, implying a variation of the $EE/BB$ ratio with frequency. We demonstrate how the previously introduced spin-moment formalism provides a natural framework to grasp these effects, allowing us to derive analytical predictions for the spectral behaviors of the polarized spectra, focusing here on the example of thermal dust polarized emission. After a quantitative discussion based on a model combining emission from a filament with its background, we further reveal that the spectral complexity implemented in the dust models commonly used by the cosmic microwave background (CMB) community produce such effects. This new understanding is crucial for CMB component separation, in which an extreme accuracy is required in the modeling of the dust signal to allow for the search of the primordial imprints of inflation or cosmic birefringence. For the latter, as long as the dust $EB$ signal is not measured accurately, great caution is required about the assumptions made to model its spectral behavior, as it may not simply follow from the other dust angular power spectra.",

In the present work, we demonstrate that the spin-moment expansion formalism provides a powerful framework to model and understand this complexity, with a special focus on that arising from variations of the physical conditions along each line-of-sight on the sky. We perform the first application of the moment expansion to reproduce a thermal dust model largely used by the CMB community, demonstrating its power as a minimal tool to compress, understand and model the information contained within any foreground model. Furthermore, we use this framework to produce new models of thermal dust emission containing the maximal amount of complexity allowed by the current data, remaining compatible with the observed angular power-spectra by the $Planck$ mission. By assessing the impact of these models on the performance of component separation methodologies, we conclude that the additional complexity contained within the third dimension could represent a significant challenge for future CMB experiments and that different component separation approaches are sensitive to different properties of the moments.",

This places Starobinsky inflation at the edge of the $2\\sigma$ constraints for a number of e-folds $N_\\star$ around $60$ when using the usual analytical approximations. We present refined predictions for Starobinsky inflation that go beyond the commonly used analytical approximations. By evaluating the model with these improved expressions, we show that for $N_\\star \\gtrsim 58$ it remains consistent with current observational constraints at the $2\\sigma$ level. Additionally, we examine the implications of the ACT results for post-inflationary reheating parameters. Specifically, we find a lower bound on the effective equation of state parameter during reheating of approximately $\\omega \\gtrsim 0.462$; this excludes purely perturbative reheating, which leads to $\\omega \\simeq 0$. We also show that the reheating temperature is constrained to be $T_{\\text{rh}} \\lesssim 2 \\times 10^{10}~\\text{GeV}$, assuming $\\omega \\leq 1$.

Pedersen, Judit Prat, Theo Schutt, Tianqing Zhang, the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration 27 pages, 14 figures, 9 tables. Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) In recent years, shear catalogs have been released by various Stage-III weak lensing surveys including the Kilo-Degree Survey, the Dark Energy Survey, and the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program. These shear catalogs have undergone rigorous validation tests to ensure that the residual shear systematic effects in the catalogs are subdominant relative to the statistical uncertainties, such that the resulting cosmological constraints are unbiased. While there exists a generic set of tests that are designed to probe certain systematic effects, the implementations differ slightly across the individual surveys, making it difficult to make direct comparisons. In this paper, we use the TXPipe package to conduct a series of predefined diagnostic tests across three public shear catalogs -- the 1,000 deg$^2$ KiDS-1000 shear catalog, the Year 3 DES-Y3 shear catalog, and the Year 3 HSC-Y3 shear catalog. We attempt to reproduce the published results when possible and perform key tests uniformly across the surveys. While all surveys pass most of the null tests in this study, we find two tests where some of the surveys fail. Namely, we find that when measuring the tangential ellipticity around bright and faint star samples, KiDS-1000 fails with a $\\chi^2$/dof of 121.1/16 and 257.7/16 for bins 4 and 5 for faint, weighted stars. We also find that DES-Y3 and HSC-Y3 fail the $B$-mode test when estimated with the Hybrid-$E$/$B$ method, with a $\\chi^2$/dof of 37.9/10 and 36.0/8 for the fourth and third autocorrelation bins. We assess the impacts on the $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ - S$_{8}$ parameter space by comparing the posteriors of a simulated data vector with and without PSF contamination -- we find negligible effects in all cases. Finally, we propose strategies for performing these tests on future surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.",

Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) offer a mechanism to alleviate these tensions within the framework of the standard model. These fields source excess small-scale baryon clumping, which can speed up recombination and shrink the comoving sound horizon at the surface of last scattering. Computing the modified recombination history requires coupling the radiative transport of Lyman-$\\alpha$ photons to compressible magnetohydronamic simulations. Since doing so is generically computationally intractable, we have developed a linearized treatment which self-consistently computes the modified recombination history in the presence of PMF induced baryon clumping for fields with red-tilted spectra. The clumping factors we find are too small to alleviate outstanding cosmological tensions, but our general framework can be applied to other PMF spectra, and provides a significant theoretical step towards a complete account of recombination in the presence of small-scale baryon clumping.",

This work tests the CDDR and cosmic transparency using angular diameter distances from DESI DR2, luminosity distances from Pantheon+, and direct measurements of the Hubble parameter. First, we use two redshift matching reconstruction method, the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Control Points Interpolating (CPI) finding that the results are highly dependent on the cosmological prior choose which relates to Hubble tension. We then estimate parameters for several phenomenological models, comparing reconstruction methods and the effect of marginalization. The results show that marginalization has no significant impact, but the choice of reconstruction method is highly influential, highlighting methodology as a primary source of systematic uncertainty. Furthermore, our test for cosmic opacity rules out cosmic dust and provides auxiliary support for the validity of the CDDR. Therefore, we conclude that the CDDR itself exhibits no significant deviation, but different redshift matching methods strongly affect the results, and some singular results are more likely attributed to supernova calibration.",

In this paper, we use image simulations to investigate how a joint analysis of high-resolution space-based and deep ground-based imaging can improve shear estimation. We simulate two scenarios: a grid-based setup, where galaxies are placed on a regular grid to mimic an idealised, blending-free scenario, and a random setup, where galaxies are randomly distributed to capture the impact of blending. Comparing these cases, we find that blending introduces significant biases, particularly in LSST-like data due to its larger point spread function. This highlights the importance of including realistic blending effects when evaluating the performance of joint analyses. Using simulations that account for blending, we find that the most effective catalogue-level synergy is achieved by combining all galaxies detected in either survey. This approach yields an effective galaxy number density of $44.08~\\rm arcmin^{-2}$ over the magnitude range of 20.0 to 27.5, compared to $39.17~\\rm arcmin^{-2}$ for LSST-like data alone and $30.31~\\rm arcmin^{-2}$ for \\textit{Euclid}-like data alone. Restricting the analysis to only the overlapping sources detected in both surveys results in a gain of ${\\sim}12\\%$ compared to using either survey alone. While this joint-object approach is suboptimal at the catalogue level, it may become more effective in pixel-level analyses, where a joint fit to individual galaxy shapes can better leverage the complementary strengths of both data sets. Studying such pixel-level combinations, with realistic blending effects properly accounted for, remains a promising direction for future work.",

Valenzuela-Toledo Main text: 26 pages, 21 figures Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The cosmological principle is a cornerstone of the standard cosmological model. However, recent observations suggest potential deviations from this assumption, hinting at a small anisotropic expansion. Such an expansion can arise from sources that break rotational invariance. A minimal realization of this scenario is described by a Bianchi I geometry, where the degree of anisotropy is quantified by the shear parameter $\\Sigma$. In this work, we constrain the present-day value of the shear, $\\Sigma_0$, by confronting theoretical predictions with recent cosmological data. We implement various anisotropic models within the Boltzmann code \\texttt{CLASS} and explore their parameter space using the sampler \\texttt{MontePython}. Although our results show that $\\Sigma_0$ is model-dependent, notably, in one specific scenario considering a homogeneous scalar field coupled to a 2-form field, $\\Sigma_0 = 0$ is excluded at the $2\\sigma$ confidence level, with mean value around $|\\Sigma_0| \\sim 10^{-4}$ while remaining consistent with observations. These findings challenge the conventional assumption that cosmic shear is negligible in the present universe. Moreover, the anisotropic expansion in this model is driven by a steep scalar field potential, a feature often found in supergravity-inspired scenarios. While anisotropic models offer interesting alternatives and could help explain some cosmological anomalies, they generally introduce additional parameters, making the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model statistically favored in most cases. Still, they remain compatible with current observations and provide new perspectives on features not fully explained within the standard framework. These results highlight the importance of further exploring anisotropic cosmologies to better understand their implications.",

Kao 15 pages, 2 tables, 4 figures, accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal (ApJ) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present a scalar-field formulation of the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) and modified Chaplygin gas (MCG) models, in which the cosmic fluid dynamics are reproduced by canonical Lagrangians with analytically derived energy density $\\rho(\\phi)$, pressure $p(\\phi)$, and scalar potential $V(\\phi)$. This framework provides a unified description of dark matter and dark energy, transitioning naturally from a matter-dominated phase at early times to a negative-pressure dark-energy phase at late times. In this scalar-field formulation, the GCG and MCG models are naturally applicable to both theoretical analyses and numerical simulations. Extending this approach, we develop a systematic method to obtain a class of integrable scalar-field cosmological models. In this study, we use this method to construct a new scalar-field altered Chaplygin gas (ACG) model. To investigate the viability of Chaplygin-type models, we perform a likelihood analysis using the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova compilation together with Cepheid-calibrated distances. We examine four models, $\\Lambda$CDM, GCG, MCG, and ACG, obtaining posterior constraints on the Hubble constant $H_0$, the present-day effective equation of state $\\omega_0$, the transition redshift $z^\\star$, and the cosmic age $t_0$. With the Cepheid calibration fixing the absolute distance scale, the inferred $H_{0}$ remains nearly model-independent. The Chaplygin-type models predict an earlier onset of cosmic acceleration than $\\Lambda$CDM and give a broader range for the inferred age of the Universe, reflecting their greater flexibility in late-time expansion histories. Among them, the ACG model provides tighter parameter constraints, while the GCG and MCG models produce broader posteriors due to parameter degeneracies.",

However they are expensive to obtain, making them prohibitive for large galaxy samples and at higher redshift. Spatially integrated HI flux profiles are more accessible and present the information in a different form, but -- except in a highly compressed form, as linewidths -- have not so far been compared in detail with RCs or employed for dynamical inferences. Here we study the consistency of RCs and HI surface density profiles from SPARC with spatially integrated HI flux profiles from ALFALFA, by combining the resolved properties in a forward model for the flux profile. We define a new metric for asymmetry in the flux profiles, enabling us to cleanly identify those unsuitable for our axisymmetric method. Among all SPARC galaxies the agreement between RCs and flux profiles is satisfactory within the limitations of the data -- with most galaxies having an uncertainty normalised mean squared error (MSE) below 10 -- while no galaxy deemed symmetric has a MSE above 1.2. Most cases of good agreement prefer a HI gas dispersion $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{HI}}$ of ~13 km/s, consistent with resolved studies of gas dispersion from the literature. These results open the door for spatially integrated HI flux profiles to be used as proxies for spatially resolved dynamics, including a robust appraisal of the degree of asymmetry.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Galaxy clusters provide a unique environment to study galaxy evolution. The role of cluster dynamical states in shaping the physical and morphological properties of member galaxies remains an open question. We aim to assess the impact of the dynamical state of massive ($M_{500} \\geq 1.5 \\times 10^{14} M_{\\odot}$) galaxy clusters on the physical and structural properties of their member galaxies, and also in their fundamental relations in the redshift range $0.10 < z < 0.35$. We use a mass-matched sample of galaxies from relaxed and disturbed clusters. Morphological types were assigned using both parametric and nonparametric methods, while physical properties were derived through SED fitting. Galaxies were further divided into subpopulations to investigate trends with cluster dynamical states. The dynamical state of galaxy clusters does not alter their fundamental relations at low redshift (such as color-magnitude, mass-size, morphology-density, and SF-density relations), nor does it significantly affect the mean or dispersion of galaxy properties. However, it does impact the distributions at the level of third- and fourth-order moments, introducing asymmetries and heavier tails in the properties of galaxies. The greatest effects are observed in the sSFRs of low-mass and red sequence galaxies. These findings suggest that, at low redshift, the fundamental relations of massive galaxy clusters are already well established and resilient to recent dynamical activity. Nonetheless, the influence of the dynamical state on the higher-order moments of galaxy properties indicates that environmental processes associated with disturbed clusters still leave measurable imprints, particularly on low-mass and red sequence galaxies. This is consistent with the idea that galaxy evolution is shaped both by early pre-processing and by subsequent interactions within dynamically active environments.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Context. Galaxies in the Universe show a conformity in the fraction of quenched galaxies out to large distances, being much larger around quenched central galaxies than for star-forming ones. On the other hand, simulations have shown that the clustering of halos and the galaxies within them depends on secondary properties other than halo mass, a phenomenon termed assembly bias. Aims. Our aim is to study whether samples that show galactic conformity also show assembly bias and to see if the amplitude of these two effects is correlated. Methods. We use synthetic galaxies at $z = 0$ from the semi-analytical model SAG run on the MultiDark Planck 2 (MDPL2) cosmological simulation and measure both conformity and galaxy assembly bias for different samples of central galaxies at fixed host halo mass. We focus on central galaxies hosted by low-mass halos of 10$^{11.6}$ $\\leq$ $M_{\\rm h}$/$h^{-1}$ M$_{\\odot}$ $<$ 10$^{11.8}$ because it is a mass range where the assembly bias has been reported to be strong. The samples of central galaxies are separated according to their specific star formation rate and stellar age. Results. We find that the level of conformity shown by our different samples is correlated with the level of assembly bias measured for them. We also find that removing central galaxies around massive halos diminishes the conformity signal and lowers the amount of assembly bias. Conclusions. The high correlation in the amplitude of conformity and assembly bias for different samples with and without removing galaxies near massive halos clearly indicates the strong relationship between both phenomena.",

      "abstract": "A new classification of ex-situ and in-situ Galactic globular clusters based on a method trained on Milky Way analogues in the TNG50 cosmological simulations Pierre Boldrini, Paola Di Matteo, Chervin Laporte, Oscar Agertz, Sergey Khoperskov, Giulia Pagnini 12 pages, 10 figures. Accepted by A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present a novel method combining existing cosmological simulations and orbital integration to study the hierarchical assembly of globular cluster (GC) populations in the Milky Way (MW). Our method models the growth and evolution of GC populations across various galactic environments as well as the dynamical friction and mass-loss experienced by these objects. This allows us to follow the trajectory of $\\sim$18,000 GCs over cosmic time in 198 MW-like galaxies from TNG50. This cosmological-scale tracking of the dynamics of in-situ and ex-situ GC populations with such a large statistical sample allows us to confirm the presence of an overlap between the two populations in MW-like galaxies, occurring below an energy threshold of $E < -0.7 |E_{\\rm circ}(r_{\\rm hm}^{*})|$ where $E_{\\rm circ}(r_{\\rm hm}^{*})$ is the energy of a circular orbit at the galaxy's stellar half-mass radius $r_{\\rm hm}^{*}$. Our results challenge the validity of current classification schemes commonly adopted in the literature, which ultimately fail to provide a clear separation between the two populations. Instead, they tend to isolate only a subset of the ex-situ GCs. More precisely, we argue that it is highly unlikely to find in-situ clusters at $E > -0.7 |E_{\\rm circ}(r_{\\rm hm}^{*})|$, and that the real challenge lies in distinguishing the two populations below this energy threshold. In this context, we provide new predictions regarding the origins of the MW GCs observed with Gaia, as well as a comparison with existing literature. Additionally, we highlight that even if ex-situ clusters share a common origin, they inevitably lose their dynamical coherence in the $E$-$L_{z}$ space within MW-like galaxies. We observe a dispersion of GC groups as a function of $E$ and $L_{z}$, primarily driven by the evolution of the galactic potential over time and by dynamical friction, respectively.",

Accepted for publication in SCIENCE CHINA Physics, Mechanics & Astronomy Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is an upcoming Stage-IV sky survey telescope, distinguished by its large field of view (FoV), high image quality, and multi-band observation capabilities. It can simultaneously conduct precise measurements of the Universe by performing multi-color photometric imaging and slitless spectroscopic surveys. The CSST is equipped with five scientific instruments, i.e. Multi-band Imaging and Slitless Spectroscopy Survey Camera (SC), Multi-Channel Imager (MCI), Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS), Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C), and THz Spectrometer (TS). Using these instruments, CSST is expected to make significant contributions and discoveries across various astronomical fields, including cosmology, galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN), the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, stars, exoplanets, Solar System objects, astrometry, and transients and variable sources. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the CSST instruments, observational capabilities, data products, and scientific potential.",

Sullivan Accepted for publication in MNRAS, 25 pages, 13 figures (+ 3 figures in the Appendix) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Using the Dark Energy Survey 5-year sample, we determine the properties of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) host galaxies across a wide multi-wavelength range - from the optical to far-infrared - including data from the $Herschel$ and $Spitzer$ space telescopes. We categorise the SNe Ia into three distinct groups according to the distribution of their host galaxies on the star-formation rate (SFR) - stellar mass ($M_\\star$) plane. Each region comprises host galaxies at distinct stages in their evolutionary pathways: Region 1 - low-mass hosts; Region 2 - high-mass, star-forming hosts and Region 3 - high-mass, passive hosts. We find SNe Ia in host galaxies located in Region 1 have the steepest slope (quantified by $\\beta$) between their colours and luminosities, with $\\beta_{\\mathrm{R_1}} = 3.51 \\pm 0.16$. This differs at the ${\\sim}6\\sigma$ significance level to SNe Ia in Region 3, which have the shallowest colour-luminosity slope with $\\beta_{\\mathrm{R_3}} = 2.12 \\pm 0.16$. After correcting SNe Ia in each subsample by their respective $\\beta$, events in Region 3 (high-mass, passive hosts) are $0.07 - 0.12$ mag ($>3\\sigma$) brighter, post-standardisation. We conclude that future cosmological analyses should apply standardisation relations to SNe Ia based upon the region in which the SN host galaxy lies in the SFR-$M_\\star$ plane. Alternatively, cosmological analyses should restrict the SN Ia sample to events whose host galaxies occupy a single region of this plane.",

Submitted to PRD High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) The flux of astrophysical neutrinos is now measured with unprecedented accuracy and on several decades of energy spectrum. Their origin traces back to hadronic collisions between protons and nuclei in the cosmic rays with hydrogen and helium in the target gas. To accurately interpret the data, a precise determination of the underlying cross sections is therefore mandatory. We present a new evaluation of the neutrino production cross section from $p+p$ collisions, building on our previous analysis of the production cross section for $\\pi^\\pm$, $K^\\pm$, and minor baryonic and mesonic channels. Cross sections for scatterings involving nuclei heavier than protons are also derived. The novelty of our approach is the analytical description of the Lorentz invariant cross section $\\sigma_{\\rm inv}$, and the fit of the model to the available accelerator data. We work with neutrino energies from $10$ GeV to $10^7$ GeV, and, correspondingly, to incident proton (nuclei) energies from $10$ GeV to $10^9$ GeV (GeV/n). We obtain the total differential cross section, $d\\sigma(p+p\\rightarrow \\nu+X)/dE_{\\nu}$ as a function of neutrino and proton energies, with an estimated uncertainty of 5% for neutrino energies below 100 GeV, increasing to 10% above TeV energies. Predictions are given for $\\nu_e, \\nu_\\mu, \\bar{\\nu_e}$ and $\\bar{\\nu_\\mu}$. A comparison with state-of-the-art cross sections, all relying on Monte Carlo generators, is also presented. To facilitate the use by the community, we provide numerical tables and a script for accessing our energy-differential cross sections.",

This study analyzes new NICER observations of QPEs in Ansky (a transient event in the nucleus of the galaxy SDSS J1335+0728), taken between January and June 2025. By examining flare durations, peak-to-peak recurrence times, and profiles, we compare the 2025 data with those from 2024 to investigate changes in energy, timescales, and flare shapes. The 2025 QPEs are found to be four times more energetic, with recurrence times of approximately 10 days and flare durations ranging from 2.5 to 4 days, making them both about twice as long as in 2024. Additionally, the flare profiles have become more asymmetric, showing longer decays. We explore different theoretical scenarios to explain the observed properties of the QPEs in Ansky, including evolving stream-disk interactions in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) system as a potential mechanism behind the observed changes in recurrence time and energetics, while also considering alternative models based on mass transfer and accretion disk instabilities. Continued observational efforts will be crucial for unveiling the nature of Ansky.",

Fiorillo (DESY) Contribution to Encyclopedia of Particle Physics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) The core of a massive star (M > 8 Msun) eventually collapses. This implosion usually triggers a supernova (SN) explosion that ejects most of the stellar envelope and leaves behind a neutron star (NS) with a mass of up to about 2 Msun. Sometimes the explosion fails and a black hole forms instead. The NS radiates its immense binding energy (some 10% of its rest mass or $2-4\\times10^{53}$ erg) almost entirely as neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors with typical energies of some 10 MeV. This makes core-collapse SNe the most powerful neutrino factories in the Universe. Such a signal was observed once - with limited statistics - from SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Today, however, many large neutrino detectors act as SN observatories and would register a high-statistics signal. A future Galactic SN, though rare (1-3 per century), would produce a wealth of astrophysical and particle-physics information, including possible signatures for new particles. Neutrinos are key to SN dynamics in the framework of the Bethe-Wilson delayed explosion paradigm. After collapse, they are trapped in the core for a few seconds, forming a dense neutrino plasma that can exhibit collective flavor evolution caused by the weak interaction, a subject of intense theoretical research.",

      "abstract": "Numerical Modeling of Relativistic Effects in Synchrotron-Emitting Shocks Ross Ferguson, Ben Margalit 25 pages, 8 figures. Submitted to ApJ. Comments welcome! High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Synchrotron emission is seen in a vast array of astrophysical transients, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), radio supernovae, neutron star (NS) mergers, tidal disruption events (TDEs), and fast blue optical transients (FBOTs). Despite the ubiquity of synchrotron-emitting sources, modeling of the emergent flux from these events often relies on simplified analytic approximations. These approximations are inaccurate for high-velocity shocks, where special-relativistic effects are important. Properly incorporating these effects considerably complicates calculations, and generally requires a numerical treatment. In this work we present a novel numerical model which solves the full radiative-transfer problem in synchrotron-emitting shocks, accounting for all relativistic effects. This `full-volume' model is capable of calculating synchrotron emission from a shock of arbitrary velocity, and is designed to be flexible and applicable to a wide range of astrophysical sources. Using this new code, we evaluate the accuracy of more commonly-used approximate models. We find that the full-volume treatment is generally necessary once the shock proper-velocity exceeds $(\\Gamma\\beta)_{\\rm sh}\\gtrsim 0.1$, and that approximate models can be inaccurate by $\\gtrsim$ an order-of-magnitude in trans-relativistic shocks. This implies that there may be a bias in the inferred physical properties of some FBOTs, jetted TDEs, and other relativistic explosions, where approximate analytic models are typically employed. The code associated with our model is made publicly available, and can be used to study the growing population of relativistic synchrotron-emitting transients.",

Coleman High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present the first three-dimensional study of the asymptotic ejecta distributions for a suite of theoretical Type IIp supernovae originating from red supergiant progenitors. We simulate using the radiation-hydrodynamic code F{\\sc{ornax}} from core bounce through the first seconds of the neutrino-driven explosion and then follow using a hydrodynamic variant of the code FLASH until shock breakout of the star and through to homologous expansion of the ejecta into the circumstellar environment. Our studied progenitor models range from 9 to 25 M$_{\\odot}$, with explosion energies spanning $\\sim$0.1$-$1 Bethe. The shock breakout times span the range $\\sim$1$-$4 days, with a breakout time spread by direction ranging from hours to over a day. We find that the dipole orientation of the $^{56}$Ni ejecta is well-preserved from the first seconds out to shock breakout. The $^{56}$Ni ejecta penetrates through the initially outer oxygen shell, and its global structure is imprinted with small-scale clumping as the ejecta evolve through the stellar envelope. For the majority of our models, the neutron star kick is anti-aligned with the $^{56}$Ni ejecta. Models with strongly dipolar ejecta morphology and a massive hydrogen/helium envelope with an inner boundary located deep see as much as $\\sim$70\\% of the $^{56}$Ni ejecta mixed into that outer envelope, reaching asymptotic velocities ranging from $\\sim$350 to 3200 km s$^{-1}$.

Developed within a Docker-based architecture, it leverages cloud-native technologies and distributed computing principles to enhance system observability and reliability. At its core, ServiMon integrates key technologies such as Prometheus, Grafana, Kafka, and Cassandra. Prometheus serves as the primary engine for real-time performance metric collection, enabling efficient monitoring across multiple nodes. Grafana provides interactive, service-oriented data visualization, facilitating system performance analysis. Additionally, Kafka and Cassandra expose system metrics via the JMX Exporter, offering critical insights into infrastructure availability and performance. This contribution exposes how ServiMon could provide an enhancement on scalability, security, and efficiency in a distributed computing environment, such as the CTAO monitoring, logging, and alarm subsystems. This integrated approach not only ensures robust real-time monitoring, but also optimizes operational costs. Furthermore, ServiMon's ability to generate large volumes of diverse data over time provides a strong foundation for predictive maintenance. By incorporating stochastic and approximate computing techniques, it enables proactive failure detection and system optimization, minimizing downtime and maximizing telescope availability.",

Telkamp Submitted to MNRAS. Comments welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Time-variable propagation effects provide a window into the local plasma environments of repeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources. Here we report high-cadence observations of FRB 20240619D, as part of the HyperFlash and ÉCLAT programs. We observed for $500$h and detected $217$ bursts, including $10$ bursts with high fluence ($>25$ Jy ms) and implied energy. We track burst-to-burst variations in dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM), from which we constrain the parallel magnetic field strength in the source's local environment: $0.32\\pm0.19$ mG. Apparent DM variations between sub-bursts in a single bright event are interpreted as coming from plasma lensing or variable emission height. We also identify two distinct scintillation screens along the line of sight, one associated with the Milky Way and the other likely located in the FRB's host galaxy or local environment. Together, these (time-variable) propagation effects reveal that FRB 20240619D is embedded in a dense, turbulent and highly magnetised plasma. The source's environment is more dynamic than that measured for many other (repeating) FRB sources, but less extreme compared to several repeaters that are associated with a compact, persistent radio source. FRB 20240619D's cumulative burst fluence distribution shows a power-law break, with a flat tail at high energies. Along with previous studies, this emphasises a common feature in the burst energy distribution of hyperactive repeaters. Using the break in the burst fluence distribution, we estimate a source redshift of $z=0.042$-$0.240$. We discuss FRB 20240619D's nature in the context of similar studies of other repeating FRBs.",

ARA consists of an array of five autonomous stations with 2 km spacing. Each station consists of 16 radio antennas embedded ${\\sim}200$ m deep in the ice that are sensitive to either vertically- or horizontally-polarized signals. Radio arrays like ARA represent a cost-efficient means of achieving the enormous detection $O(10~\\text{km}^3)$ volumes necessary for UHE neutrino detection. This contribution presents the current status of the first-ever array-wide search for UHE neutrinos, leveraging ARA's unprecedented ${\\sim}28$ station-years of livetime. This search will have the best sensitivity of any neutrino detector above $3$ EeV, sufficient to probe the $220$ PeV flux inferred from KM3NeT's observation of KM3-230213A. Importantly, this study demonstrates the feasibility of array-wide neutrino searches, which are necessary for next-generation detectors, like RNO-G (35 stations planned) and IceCube-Gen2 Radio (361 stations proposed), to achieve their design sensitivity.

With the recent KM3Net observation of an approximately $220$ PeV neutrino, there is renewed, urgent interest in further unlocking the ultra-high energy neutrino sky. We present updated calculations of ARA's array-wide effective volume, sensitivity, and expected event rates for ultra-high energy neutrino-induced cascades. Notably, results now account for the contributions of secondary particles from neutrino interactions (such as muon tracks) and multi-station detections within a detailed detector simulation framework. Previous work has shown these secondary interactions and multi-station coincidences compose 25\\% and 8\\% of the detector's effective area, respectively. We intend to extend these results towards a novel analysis that estimates the degree to which secondary cascades and multi-station observations are detectable in a real neutrino search.

Using a representative DM mass $m_{\\chi} = 10$ GeV and a barotropic DE relation, we add source terms Qi to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations and examine three cases: (i) noninteracting fluids (Model I), (ii) fully interacting baryon plus DM and DM with DE fluids with optional DM self repulsion (Model II), and (iii) a unified dark sector coupled to baryons (Model III). Two effects dominate: softening by massive, pressure-poor DM, and additional softening/ and binding from DE with negative pressures. Model I isolates these baselines. In Model II, exchange terms self regulate, making the mass radius curves nearly independent of the coupling parameter $\\alpha$ for nearly five orders of magnitude. Model III breaks this $\\alpha$ degeneracy: a sizable vacuum fraction suppresses the baryonic pressure gradient, reducing both the maximum mass and radii, whereas a pure-DM core is less sensitive.

      "abstract": "Light curves of time-dependent accretion disk in tidal disruption events Chenlei Guo, Erlin Qiao 18 pages, 9 figures. Submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are believed to be an ideal laboratory for studying the evolution of accretion flow around a supermassive black hole (BH). In general, the mass feeding rate to the BH is suggested to be super-Eddington initially, and evolves to be sub-Eddington on timescale of years. In this paper, we carry out calculations of the time-dependent evolution of accretion disk in the standard environment of TDE, i.e., injecting matter at the circularization radius of the stellar debris in the form of $\\dot M_{\\rm inject} \\propto t^{-5/3}$. One of the main findings is that when $\\dot M_{\\rm inject}$ evolves to a value around the Eddington accretion rate, the radiation pressure instability occurs. We test the influence of the model parameters on the light curves, such as the BH mass $M_{\\rm BH}$, viscosity parameter $\\alpha$, and mass-injecting radius $R_{\\rm{out}}$, all of which are found to affect the light curves to some extent. In most cases, we find that the light curves oscillate significantly due to the radiation pressure instability. As an exception, when $\\alpha$ is small or $R_{\\rm{out}}$ is large, we find that the oscillations are completely suppressed. In this case, the light curve drops steeply and then becomes flat in the late-time evolution, which is applied to explaining the observed ultraviolet (UV) light curves of ASASSN-15oi and ASASSN-14ae together with the assumption of a photosphere. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of our time-dependent accretion disk model to explaining multi-band light curves of TDEs in the future.",

Fittings across altitudes of 5000-5900 m and zenith angles from 0 to 40 degrees quantify deviations in particle numbers, showing that the modified profile yields deviations below 4.7%, compared to up to 12.5% for the classical profile. These improvements address low-energy ionization losses, atmospheric density variations, and zenith-angle effects, enhancing accuracy for high-altitude observatories like HAWC and the proposed CONDOR array.

However, the dominant jet component hinders the application of RM method for blazars. In this work, we present a new algorithm to disentangle the contributions of the accretion disk and relativistic jet in blazars by analyzing the optical spectroscopic data. Applying this method to two flat-spectrum radio quasars, PKS 1510-089 and PKS 0736+017, we find that the H$\\gamma$ variability in PKS 1510-089 lags behind the disk by approximately 116 days, while the H$\\beta$ line exhibits a lag of about 52 days relative to the disk in PKS 0736+017. Based on these measured time lags, we estimate that the black hole masses are about $1.8 \\times 10^8\\ M_\\odot$ for PKS 1510-089 and about $7.0 \\times 10^7\\ M_\\odot$ for PKS 0736+017, respectively.

We report \\textit{IXPE} results and SED modeling of PKS 2155$-$304 and 3C 454.3, a high- and low-synchrotron-peaked blazar. For PKS 2155$-$304, model-independent analysis gives polarization angle $\\Psi_X$ = (130$\\pm$2.5) deg and polarization degree $\\Pi_X$ = (20.9$\\pm$1.8)\\% in the 2$-$8 keV band, in agreement with spectro-polarimetric analysis. We found $\\Pi_X$ varies with time and shows indications of energy dependence, suggesting stratified emission regions. For 3C 454.3, no X-ray polarization is detected in the June 2023 observation, analyzed here for the first time. The detection in PKS 2155$-$304 and non-detection in 3C 454.3 are consistent with X-ray emission from synchrotron and inverse Compton processes, respectively. Dividing the dataset into finer time bins allows a more granular view of polarization variability. We modeled the broadband SEDs using quasi-simultaneous optical, UV, and X-ray data from {\\it Swift}, {\\it AstroSat}, and $\\gamma$-rays from {\\it Fermi}. In PKS 2155$-$304, X-rays lie in the high-energy tail of the synchrotron component, while in 3C 454.3 they lie in the rising part of the inverse Compton component. Our SED modeling with X-ray polarization favors a leptonic scenario for PKS 2155$-$304. These results support a structured jet model where X-ray emission originates from a compact acceleration zone near the shock front, while lower-energy optical emission comes from a broader turbulent region.",

      "abstract": "Radiation Mediated Shock and Planar Shock Breakout in the Presence of Atomic Transition Lines Jonathan Morag High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We numerically study fast Newtonian radiation mediated shocks (RMS - v/c~0.2) in two simplified problems in the context of supernova shock breakout; (1) An RMS traveling in a uniform medium, and (2) an RMS escaping a powerlaw density profile in planar geometry (\\rho~x^n). Both problems were previously solved in the literature assuming a fully ionized plasma medium emitting Bremstrahllung. It was shown that at high shock velocities photons can deviate from local thermal equilibrium (LTE) and reach distributions peaked at many keV. In this study we incorporate, for the first time, opacity from bound species of heavy elements (solar-like composition) into these two problems, at times drastically augmenting the photon production due to bound-free and bound-bound radiative processes. We use a previously developed hydrodynamically coupled multi-group radiative diffusion code, including inelastic Compton scattering and frequency-dependent opacity from the publicly available TOPS table. Adding a more realistic opacity leads the radiation to maintain LTE at higher velocities in comparison to the fully ionized problem. In the planar SBO problem this opacity can reduce the emission temperature by half and even an order of magnitude. This result is important for the observation of supernova shock breakout emission. The SED of SN envelope breakout will very likely remain in LTE for explosions in red super giant stars without stellar wind (and part of blue super giant star explosions), making X-Ray observations less likely in these cases by orders of magnitude relative to previous predictions. We provide a semi-analytic description for the SED in the case where LTE is maintained. A correct shock-breakout calculation requires opacity tables that include bound yet highly ionized species, ruling out the use of certain line tables (such as the commonly used Kurucz table).",

      "abstract": "On Atomic Line Opacities for Modeling Astrophysical Radiative Transfer Jonathan Morag High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) In astrophysics, line opacity is a primary source of uncertainty in theoretical calculations of radiative transfer. Much of this uncertainty is dominated by the inability to resolve the width and separation in frequency of sharp atomic transition lines, leading to the common use of approximate frequency-averaged treatments for the lines. In a previous paper, we calculated shock-cooling emission following explosions in core-collapse supernovae using a mult-group radiative transfer code, and compared the results to those of the similar and often used STELLA code from the literature. We found important differences in the spectral energy distribution (SED) resulting from different choices of line opacity treatment. In our code, we used in the emissivity a frequency-binned average of a high-resolution opacity, while in STELLA the often-used Eastman Pinto 1993 (EP93) prescription was employed. In this short letter we revisit this comparison, essentially reproducing STELLA bound-free (photoionization) and bound-bound (line transition) opacities. We show the importance of introducing micro-plasma electron excitation level cutoffs in the equation of state (EOS). We also argue that EP93 is useful for estimating photon mean free-path in the presence of a forest of lines, but that it can underestimate photon production and reprocessing rates (emissivity) by orders of magnitude. To our knowledge, no fully-consistent coarse-frequency solution currently exists for line modeling in these systems. Finally, we describe new features in our updated publicly available high-resolution frequency-dependent opacity table.",

A hybrid detector design with a surface array and deep underground detector, such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, allows simultaneous measurements of muons at two vastly different energies: at GeV energies and above a few 100GeV. We present phenomenological studies of low-energy and high-energy muons in simulated air showers, and discuss how hybrid measurements can provide constraints on multi-particle production in hadronic interaction models.",

In recent years, changing-look blazars have put into question the traditional BL Lacs-flat spectrum radio quasars empirical classification of blazars based on the intensity of optical spectral lines, as they appear to transition between the two classes over time. Aims. We focus on the blazar 5BZQ J1243+4043, recently proposed as a promising candidate for the emission of high-energy neutrinos observed by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and reported as a changing look in the literature. We study the spectral properties of this blazar, inferring its radiation field and accretion regime properties among different epochs. Methods. This study presents new optical spectroscopy observations of 5BZQ J1243+4043 taken with the Gran Telescopio Canarias. We use this new dataset and two optical spectra available from the literature to investigate the continuum and line emissions and pinpoint the physical properties of the source. Results. The newly collected data for 5BZQ J1243+4043 shows broad emission lines, consistent with the spectrum of the first epoch and the redshift $z = 1.5181\\pm0.0002$ known from the literature. For the second epoch, the spectrum appears featureless, and we place limits on the emission lines and related physical properties. We observe spectral variability for both the continuum and line emissions among the three spectra. Despite this, the accretion properties of the blazar remain, overall, unvaried, indicating that the intrinsic physics remains the same across the three epochs. In the broader multi-messenger context, this suggests that, despite the changing look in the optical band, the candidate neutrino-emitter blazar 5BZQ J1243+4043 remains characterized by the presence of intense external radiation fields and radiatively efficient accretion, typical of high-excitation radio galaxies, that may foster neutrino production.",

EAS measurements above the knee, for instance, have helped to understand some aspects about the acceleration and propagation mechanisms of the PeV component of cosmic rays and have shown possible hints about the transition from the galactic to the extragalactic regime. Meanwhile, EAS data in the TeV energy range have revealed unexpected features in the all-particle and elemental spectra, which may indicate the presence of previously unknown cosmic-ray phenomena. In this contribution, I will present a brief account on these EAS results, with particular emphasis on the recent measurements of the all-particle energy spectrum and the elemental composition of cosmic rays from 10 TeV up to 1 EeV. In addition, I will compare the latest results of EAS experiments and direct detectors at energies just below the knee, where there exists an overlap between both detection techniques.",

In this study, we systematically compare various techniques for detecting GRB-like transient emissions at very high energies (VHE, >100 GeV). Our analysis includes time-dependent extension of the standard method (i.e., Li & Ma 1983) and other previously developed methods in the literature, alongside a novel likelihood-based approach, which directly fits spectral and temporal decay features to IACT data. Through dedicated observation simulations, we evaluate the performance of these methods for the Large-Sized Telescope prototype (LST-1) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). We characterised the enhanced sensitivity found in some of these methods compared to the standard significance estimation. For GRBs simulated with very fast afterglow decay, an improvement of more than a factor of two is seen in detections for some of the methods presented here, compared to the standard Li&Ma approach.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Analysis of radio emission from tidal disruption events allows for detailed constraints on the properties of ejected outflows and the host environment surrounding the black hole. However, the late-time radio behaviour of tidal disruption events is not well-studied due to a lack of observations. In this work we present long-term radio monitoring observations of the tidal disruption event AT2019azh spanning 1167-2159 days post disruption. We fit a physically motivated synchrotron model to the radio spectra at each epoch, and model the decay of the light curve under the assumption that the outflow transitions into the non-relativistic Sedov-Taylor regime at late times. Through this modelling we obtain strong constraints on the density profile of the circumnuclear medium, finding an unusually flat density profile proportional to $r^{0.24^{+0.11}_{-0.15}}$. Overall we find that unlike some tidal disruption events, AT2019azh does not show late time re-brightening up to 6 years post-disruption. The Sedov-Taylor light curve decay model provides a good fit to the data, motivating the assumption that the outflow was produced by a single ejection of material close to the time of stellar disruption. From forward modelling the evolution of the radio light curve decay we predict that the radio afterglow from AT2019azh should be detectable for decades at its current rate of evolution.",

Radio detection promises significant advantages for detecting highly inclined air showers induced by UHE neutrinos, including a larger exposure range compared to particle detectors, which is due to minimal atmospheric attenuation of radio signals combined with good reconstruction precision. Furthermore, this technique improves the air shower longitudinal reconstruction, which can be used to identify neutrinos with their first interaction far below the top of the atmosphere. In this work, we present a method for identifying UHE neutrinos using radio antennas deployed in ground-based observatories. We introduce a reconstruction algorithm based on the radio emission maximum ($X^{\\text{radio}}_{\\text{max}}$) and demonstrate its power in distinguishing deeply developing neutrino-induced showers from background cosmic rays. Using the Pierre Auger Observatory as a case study, we use the simulations of $\\nu_e$-CC-induced air showers and evaluate the trigger efficiency, reconstruction performance, and resulting effective area. Our results show that radio detection significantly enhances the sensitivity to very inclined showers above 1~EeV, complementing traditional surface detectors. This technique is highly scalable and applicable to future radio observatories such as GRAND. The proposed reconstruction and identification strategy provides a pathway toward achieving the sensitivity needed to detect UHE neutrinos.",

In this study, we explore a novel observational strategy to search for Hawking radiation from asteroid-mass black hole morsels -- hypothetical small black holes that may form and be ejected during catastrophic events such as binary black hole mergers. These black hole morsels are expected to emit gamma rays in the GeV-TeV range on observable timescales. We analyze data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope coinciding with the well-localized binary black hole merger GW170814, searching for delayed gamma-ray signatures associated with morsel evaporation. While we find no evidence for such emission, we place exclusion limits on morsel masses, ruling out the 4 x 10^8 kg scenario at the 95 percent confidence level for a total emitted mass of one solar mass. We also outline future directions, including the incorporation of late-time evaporation spikes, systematic application across the growing gravitational wave catalog, and the enhanced discovery potential of next-generation facilities such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory.",

Master thesis in Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, supervised by Pedro de la Torre Luque and Miguel Ángel Sánchez Conde High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Despite decades of direct and indirect searches within the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) framework, no conclusive results have been found in the GeV--TeV range. This has motivated exploring alternatives, including new particles and macroscopic objects. Two well-motivated scenarios are sub-GeV DM and Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). Molecular clouds (MCs), typically studied as star-forming sites, can serve as astrophysical laboratories to probe these candidates via their ionization rates. Observations show ionization levels exceeding expectations from known CR fluxes, pointing to an additional ionizing component. Here, we consider electrons and positrons from annihilating and decaying MeV DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation from evaporating PBHs, as possible contributors. We model transport driven by energy losses within the clouds. By comparing predicted ionization rates with observations, conservative constraints are set on the thermally averaged cross section $\\langle\\sigma v\\rangle$, decay lifetime $\\tau$ and PBH abundances $f_{PBH}$. The analysis assumes all the observed ionization comes from DM and adopts a 95% confidence level. Results show that, even in the most conservative case of local MCs such as L1551, these constraints are very close to the most competitive bounds from X-ray observations, while inner-Galaxy clouds like DRAGON or G1.4--1.8+87 provide stronger limits, sometimes improving X-ray and cosmological constraints. For sub-GeV DM, MCs exclude parameter space competitive with the one tested by NuSTAR, INTEGRAL, or Voyager, especially below $\\sim$30 MeV. In the PBH case, asteroid-mass black holes are restricted to a low fraction of DM, with optimistic scenarios getting close to the strongest limits. This demonstrates the potential of MCs as a novel probe in indirect DM searches.",

Veres, Julia Becker Tjus High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Seyfert-starburst composite galaxies host two promising phenomena of non-thermal high-energy radiation. In this regard the IceCube observation of high-energy neutrinos from the direction of the Seyfert-starburst composite galaxy NGC 1068 is not surprising. More recently, another Seyfert-starburst composite galaxy, NGC 7469, has shown hints for neutrino emission at even higher energies. Theoretical investigations could clarify that their so-called AGN corona is the most-likely origin of these neutrinos due to the need of being partially $\\gamma$-ray opaque. In this work, we present an updated version of our Seyfert-starburst composite model from 2022, that accounts for a proper treatment of the stochastic acceleration processes in the AGN corona and the secondary electrons and positrons from leptonic radiation processes. Moreover, we use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to study the parameter space of these two potential high-energy neutrino sources under consideration of the given prior knowledge. In the case of NGC 1068, we can successfully explain its non-thermal observational features, where both its AGN corona and starburst ring are needed to account for the observations at high- energies. In the case of NGC 7469, the high-energy signatures can only be explained assuming a small coronal radius and the including external $\\gamma\\gamma$-pair attenuation. In general, both sources exhibit a strong influence of the $\\gamma$-ray opaqueness on the results, highlighting the need for an accurate treatment of the intrinsic coronal X-ray field and the spatial extent of the $\\gamma$-ray production site.",

Comments welcome Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) A variety of physical processes leads to the low-energy ejection of material from the hydrogen-rich envelopes of red and yellow supergiants. These include common envelope events, stellar mergers, eruptive mass loss, and failed supernovae. These events may appear as luminous red novae, intermediate luminosity red transients, supernova imposters, or other transients with similar lightcurves and colors that are followed by the disappearance of the progenitor star (e.g. failed supernovae). The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will find these events in large numbers; detailed modeling of their lightcurves is essential for photometrically differentiating between these important physical processes in the lives of massive stars. We use one-dimensional, radiation hydrodynamic simulations to model the lightcurves of low-energy explosions of red and yellow supergiants. Red supergiant explosions have durations of 100-400 days, longer than Type IIp supernovae, while stripped, yellow supergiant explosions have durations of 10s of days. Our models probe the boundary between the radiation-pressure dominated and gas-pressure dominated regimes. We provide fitting formulae for the plateau luminosity and duration of the events. Finally, we show that the failed supernovae candidates in NGC 6946 and M31 are consistent with failed supernovae models for explosion energies of $\\sim10^{47}-10^{49}$ erg.",

Despite their importance, the driving physics behind galactic outflows and their interaction with the surrounding halo is yet to be fully understood. In particular, the influence of a pre-existing reservoir of cosmic rays (CRs) in galaxy halos has not been clearly established. We determine the conditions required to launch outflows in the presence of halo CRs and investigate how CR pressure gradients modify outflow speeds. We find that CR halos suppress the development of large-scale, CR-driven winds and redirect CR feedback toward local recycling flows. Slow outflows are therefore more likely in young galaxies lacking extended CR halos, while fast winds in intense starbursts are dominated by momentum injection and largely unaffected by halo CRs.",

Furthermore, the experiment intends to test new tools for the detection of photons in the energy range of about 0.03-50 MeV, allowing the investigation of transient phenomena like gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). A high-density segmented calorimeter exploiting novel scintillator crystals and silicon photomultiplier technology for the readout system will serve this purpose along its main task of calorimetric energy measurement of the cosmic-ray charged particles. In this work, we discuss the functionality of the calorimeter as a GRB monitor through the calculation of its performance in terms of effective area, sensitivity, and timing response for the transient outbursts.",

In this work, we investigated how variations in the ${}^{12} \\mathrm{C}(\\alpha, \\gamma)^{16} \\mathrm{O}$ reaction rate affect the evolution of a 14 $\\rm M_{\\odot}$ He star using the MESA code. Our simulations indicate that the ${}^{12} \\mathrm{C}(\\alpha, \\gamma)^{16} \\mathrm{O}$ reaction rate determines the conditions for C burning, affecting its explodability. As the reaction rate increases, central C-burning becomes neutrino-dominated, transitioning from the convective to the radiative regime. This leads to higher compactness and a larger iron core, indicating a more compact pre-SN core structure that is difficult to explode. Conversely, lower reaction rates shorten the C-burning lifetime and trigger earlier central Ne ignition, which counteracts core contraction. This results in reduced compactness and iron core mass. We also found that variations in reaction rates shift the location of the last C-burning shell. When this shell exceeds the mass coordinate used for compactness evaluation, the overall compactness increases significantly. Although the Si- and O-burning convective shells decrease compactness, the overall increase remains unaffected. This work suggests that the ${}^{12} \\mathrm{C}(\\alpha, \\gamma)^{16} \\mathrm{O}$ reaction play an important role in the pre-SN core structure and potentially impact the explodability of massive He stars.",

Submitted to A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Between 40$\\%$ and 80$\\%$ of cataclysmic variables (CVs) are expected to have evolved past the period-minimum and contain a degenerate donor. However, observational surveys for CVs have only been able to detect a few of these highly evolved \"period-bouncers\", most likely due to the intrinsic faintness associated with their predicted low mass accretion rates. We have produced an initial selection of 137 high-likelihood period-bounce candidates from WD catalog based on our multiwavelength period-bouncer scorecard and selection cuts including X-ray data from the extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma spacecraft (SRG). We have laid out three main requirements (classification as a CV, determination of an orbital period and detection of a very late-type donor) that should result in the confirmation of several of these candidates. Our path for confirming these candidates has already produced its first successful result with the confirmation of GALEX J125751.4-283015 as a new period-bouncer. Several other candidates have already fulfilled at least one of our three requirements making their future confirmation likely. Our search for period-bouncers using the X-ray eROSITA emission of objects in optical WD catalogs has led to the confirmation of six new period-bouncers identified from the Gaia DR3 WD catalog (five previously known CVs and one WD candidate), a 18$\\%$ increase that brings the present population to 39 systems. Both the selection method for period-bounce candidates and the confirmation path that we outlined will aid in future searches for new period-bounce candidates, contributing to the goal of resolving the discrepancy between the predicted high number of period-bouncers and the low number of these systems successfully observed to date.",

Our study intended to determine the optimal SiPM design for the Terzina Cherenkov satellite in sun-synchronous low Earth orbit (LEO) at an altitude of 550 km.

Most 21 pages, 8 Figures, Published in ApJL. Animations available at this https URL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Supermassive binary black holes in galactic centers are potential multimessenger sources in gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation. To find such objects, isolating unique electromagnetic signatures of their accretion flow is key. With the aid of three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations that utilize an approximate, semi-analytic, super-imposed spacetime metric, we identify two such signatures for merging binaries. Both involve magnetic reconnection and are analogous to plasma processes observed in the solar corona. The first, like colliding flux tubes that can cause solar flares, involves colliding jets that form an extended reconnection layer, dissipating magnetic energy and causing the two jets to merge. The second, akin to coronal mass ejection events, involves the accretion of magnetic field lines onto both black holes; these magnetic fields then twist, inflate, and form a trailing current sheet, ultimately reconnecting and driving a hot outflow. We provide estimates for the associated electromagnetic emission for both processes, showing that they likely accelerate electrons to high energies and are promising candidates for continuous, stochastic, and/or quasi-periodic higher energy electromagnetic emission. We also show that the accretion flows around each black hole can display features associated with the magnetically arrested state. However, simulations with black hole spins misaligned with the orbital plane and simulations with larger Bondi radii saturate at lower values of horizon-penetrating magnetic flux than standard magnetically arrested disks, leading to weaker, intermittent jets due to feedback from the weak jets or equatorial flux tubes ejected by reconnecting field lines near the horizon.",

Replaced to match the last version High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Radio transients, such as pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), are primarily detected at centimetre radio wavelengths, where higher luminosities are found. However, observations of sources in dense environments are heavily affected by propagation effects which may hinder a detection. Millimetre wave observations bypass this complication but require the largest radio telescopes to compensate for the lower flux densities. When used in phased mode, the ALMA radio telescope provides an equivalent dish size of 84m, being the most sensitive instrument at mm/sub mm. With its high time resolution it offers a unique opportunity to study radio transients in an unexplored window. We study the Galactic Centre (GC) magnetar, PSR J1745$-$2900, as a laboratory for magnetars in complex magneto-turbulent environments and to link with FRBs. We showcase the potential of ALMA in phased mode to observe radio transients and to achieve, for some sources, the first ever detections outside the cm wave range. We studied the GC magnetar using ALMA archival data of Sgr A* at Band 3 from the 2017 GMVA campaign. We searched in intensity and classified the pulses based on their circular and linear polarisation properties and arrival phase. We detected eight pulses with energies in the range of 10$^{29}$ erg. We constructed its cumulative energy distribution and we fit a power law, where the event rate scales with energy as $R \\propto E^{\\gamma}$. The result is an exponent of $\\gamma = -2.4 \\pm 0.1$. With the $\\gamma -$value and the system properties of phased ALMA, we estimate that over 160 known pulsars could be detected by ALMA. For repeating FRBs, observing during their peak activity window could lead to several detections. We expect that ALMA's lower frequency bands with polarisation capabilities, will serve as a pioneer on mm wave searches for pulsars and to study complex environments involving radio transients.",

We study the evolution of hard ($4$-150$ keV) and soft ($2$-$4$ keV) band photon count rates, the hardness ratio (HR), QPO frequencies, and spectral features using daily observations from the HXMT/LE, ME, and HE instruments between August 25 and October 5, 2023.

Based on the evolution of the temporal and spectral properties, the rising phase of the outburst is subdivided into six parts. The evolution of the QPOs in parts 1-5 is fitted with the propagating oscillatory shock (POS) solution to understand the nature of the evolution from a physical perspective.

Motivated by this, we investigate the influence of fermionic asymmetric dark matter (ADM) on the equilibrium structure of progenitor cores and the formation of their neutron star remnants. Using a general relativistic two-fluid formalism, we model the coupled evolution of ordinary matter (OM) and ADM, treated as separately conserved fluids interacting solely through gravity. Our analysis focuses on neon-rich white dwarfs (Ne WDs), which are typical progenitor cores for ECSNe. We assume conservation of both baryon number ($N_B$) and dark matter particle number ($N_D$) during collapse, allowing for a consistent mapping between progenitor and remnant configurations. We find that ADM significantly enhances the central density of the WD progenitor. This lowers the threshold gravitational mass $M^*$ required to initiate electron capture, enabling ECSNe from lower-mass progenitors. The resulting remnants are stable, dark matter-admixed neutron stars with gravitational masses potentially well below current observational bounds. Moreover, we find that the conversion energy during the WD-to-NS conversion is also significantly reduced for higher ADM particle masses and fractions, suggesting that unusually low-energy ECSNe may serve as potential indicators of ADM involvement in stellar collapse.",

      "abstract": "The Landscape of Collapsar Outflows: Structure, Signatures and Origins of Einstein Probe Relativistic Supernova Transients Ore Gottlieb High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The Einstein Probe is revolutionizing time-domain astrophysics through the discovery of new classes of X-ray transients associated with Type Ic-Broad Line supernovae. These events commonly exhibit bright early-time optical counterparts, and sudden afterglow rebrightening within the first week - features that existing models fail to explain. In particular, structured jet and cocoon scenarios are inconsistent with the observed sharp rebrightening and multi-day optical emission, while the refreshed shock model is ruled out due to its inconsistency with collapsar hydrodynamics. Drawing on 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we present the multi-scale angular and radial structure characterizing collapsar outflows. The resulting morphology features episodic, wobbling jets with a \"top-hat\" geometry, embedded within a smoother global cocoon and disk ejecta angular structure. The wobbling jets give rise to variations in radiative efficiency that can account for the observed alternation between X-ray-dominated and $\\gamma$-ray-dominated jet emission. The top-hat structure of individual wobbling jet episodes naturally explains the sudden rebrightening observed when the emission from the top-hat jet cores enters the observer's line of sight. The radial structure is consistent with that inferred from observations of stripped-envelope supernovae. It comprises a mildly relativistic cocoon ($0.3\\lesssim\\beta\\Gamma\\lesssim3$) that may power an early ($\\sim1\\,{\\rm day}$) rapidly decaying emission, followed by slower, black hole accretion disk-driven outflows ($\\beta\\lesssim0.3$), which dominate the slowly evolving optical emission at $t\\gtrsim1\\,{\\rm day}$. This novel multi-component outflow structure provides a unified explanation for the multiband light curves observed in Einstein Probe transients and is likely a common feature of Type Ic-Broad Line supernovae more broadly.",

We conduct a spectro-polarimetric analysis combining IXPE data with archival Chandra, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and Swift observations. We explore two limiting magnetic field configurations, parallel and perpendicular to the bulk flow, and simulate their expected polarization signatures using the {\\tt 3DPol} radiative transport code. To account for the rapid rotation of the polarization angle predicted by these models, we implement a phase-dependent Stokes alignment procedure that preserves the polarization degree while correcting for a phase-rotating PA. We also devise a new maximum-likelihood fitting strategy to determine the phase-dependence of the polarization angle by minimizing the polarization degree uncertainty. This technique hints that the binary may be rotating clockwise relative to the celestial north pole. We find no significant detection of polarization in the IXPE data, with PD<50% at 99% confidence level. Our results excludes the high-polarization degree scenario predicted by the perpendicular field model during the brightest orbital phase bin. Simulations show that doubling the current exposure would make the parallel configuration detectable. The new PA rotation technique is also applicable to IXPE data of many sources whose intrinsic PA variation is apriori not known but is strictly periodic.",

This population consists of a well-known subset called Little Red Dots (LRDs) and the remaining non-LRDs. If all of these broad H$\\alpha$ emitters were attributed to type $1-1.9$ Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), it would imply a significantly higher number density of low-luminosity AGNs than extrapolated from that of more luminous AGNs. Here, we have examined the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV)-optical flux variability of three LRD and two non-LRD broad H$\\alpha$ emitters using multi-epoch, multi-band JWST/NIRCam imaging data. The rest-frame temporal sampling interval of the NIRCam data ($\\sim 400-500$~days$/(1+z)$) is comparable to typical variability timescales of AGNs with black hole (BH) masses of $M_{\\text{BH}} \\sim 10^{7}~M_{\\odot}$; thus, the flux variations should be detectable if AGNs were present. However, no measurable flux variation over the rest-frame wavelength range of $\\lambda_{\\text{rest}} \\sim 1,500-9,000$Å has been detected, placing stringent upper limits on the variability amplitudes. This result, combined with the X-ray faintness confirmed by the ultra-deep Chandra data, indicates that, under the AGN scenario, we need to postulate peculiar Compton-thick broad-line AGNs with either ($a$) an intrinsically non-variable AGN disk continuum, ($b$) a host galaxy-dominated continuum, or ($c$) scattering-dominated AGN emission. Alternatively, ($d$) they could be non-AGNs where the broad-line emission originates from unusually fast and dense/low-metallicity star-formation-driven outflows or inelastic Raman scattering of stellar UV continua by neutral hydrogen atoms.",

The source SDSS J2320+0024 was recently proposed as a promising SBHB candidate due to a possible periodicity in its light curve and variability in the MgII emission line. In this work, we reanalysed the optical (g, r, and i bands) light curves of J2320+0024 within the framework of Bayesian model selection. When periodicity was searched for together with red noise, analysis of the g-band light curve reveals a peak in the posterior of the period at ~290 days. The posterior profile is too broad to yield a preference for periodic models over models that include only red noise. Furthermore, the same peak is not present in the analysis of the r-band and i-band light curve. A periodic model without red noise identified a different (~1100 days) periodicity, but this model is statistically significantly disfavoured relative to the other models tested. In summary, we find no significant evidence in favour of a true periodic signal over red-noise variability. Our analysis questions the robustness of the previously proposed periodicity and emphasises the importance of rigorous statistical treatment. While our findings challenge the binary interpretation for J2320+0024, they do not rule it out. A statistically robust joint analysis of the photometric light curves and evolving broad-line profiles would shed further light on the true nature of this object.",

Comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of three recently discovered star-forming dwarf galaxies beyond the Local Group: Pavo, Corvus A, and Kamino. The discovery of Kamino is reported here for the first time. They rank among the most isolated faint dwarf galaxies known, hence they provide unique opportunities to study galaxy evolution at the smallest scales, free from environmental effects of more massive galaxies. Our HST data reach $\\sim$2-4 magnitudes below the tip of the red giant branch for each dwarf, allowing us to measure their distances, structural properties, and recent star formation histories (SFHs). All three galaxies contain a complex stellar population of young and old stars, and are typical of field galaxies in this mass regime ($M_V=-10.62\\pm0.08$ and $D=2.16^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ Mpc for Pavo, $M_V=-10.91\\pm0.10$ and $D=3.34\\pm0.11$ Mpc for Corvus A, and $M_V=-12.02\\pm0.12$ and $D=6.50^{+0.15}_{-0.11}$ Mpc for Kamino). Our HST-derived SFHs reveal differences among the three dwarfs: Pavo and Kamino show relatively steady, continuous star formation, while Corvus A formed $\\sim$$60$% of its stellar mass by 10 Gyr ago. These results align with theoretical predictions of diverse evolutionary pathways for isolated low-mass galaxies.",

We classify sources using stellar evolution and population synthesis models combined with empirical classifications derived from the literature. Our classifications include H$\\alpha$-bright and dust-embedded optically faint clusters, red supergiants (RSGs), oxygen-rich and carbon-rich AGB stars, and a range of rarer stellar types. In sampling a broad range of star forming environments with a uniform, well-characterized selection, this catalog enables enables analyses of infrared-bright stellar populations. We find that H$\\alpha$-faint sources account for only 10% of dusty (likely young) clusters, implying that the infrared-bright, optically-faint phase of cluster evolution is short compared to the H$\\alpha$-bright stage. The luminosity functions of 10 and 21 $\\mu$m sources follow power-law distributions, with the 21 $\\mu$m slope ($-1.7 \\pm 0.1$) similar to that of giant molecular cloud mass functions and ultraviolet bright star-forming complexes, while the 10 $\\mu$m slope ($-2.0 \\pm 0.1$) is closer to that of young stellar clusters.",

This wide-angle tail (WAT) galaxy exhibits a complex radio morphology, characterised by a right-angled bend in the northern jet, which resembles an axe, and multiple kinks in the southern jet, as observed in the deep uGMRT radio observations. The radio power of J1051+5523 at 150 MHz is estimated to be $2.91 \\times 10^{25}\\,\\mathrm{W\\,Hz^{-1}}$, placing it in the transition zone between FRI and FRII radio galaxies. The spectral index map reveals a flat core and relatively flat lobes, which may indicate ongoing particle acceleration or a relatively young population of relativistic electrons in the lobes. Further, we estimate the equipartition magnetic fields, and spectral ages of the northern and southern lobes to be approximately 150 Myr and 153 Myr, respectively, suggesting a long-lived radio source with sustained AGN activity. A relative velocity of 278 $\\pm$ 2643 $\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$ is obtained for the host galaxy. Due to the large uncertainty associated with the relative velocity estimates, the contribution of ram pressure to the jet bending remains inconclusive. The low mass of the host cluster ($\\sim 2 \\times 10^{14}\\,M_\\odot$) and the lack of diffuse X-ray emission indicate a reduced likelihood of major mergers, but minor mergers or interactions remain possible. We propose that the observed WAT morphology of J1051+5523 is likely shaped by a combination of ram pressure and/or buoyant forces within the cluster environment.",

Tailo Accepted for publication on A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) \\omega}Centauri ({\\omega}Cen) is the most enigmatic Galactic globular cluster (GC), with unmatched chemical complexity. We combine photometric and spectroscopic catalogs to identify its distinct stellar populations and to investigate their spatial distribution and chemical properties, uncovering new insights into the cluster's formation history. We identify the iron-poor stars commonly found in GCs: the first population (1P), with halo-like chemical composition, and the second population (2P), enriched in elements produced by p-capture processes. Similarly, we divided the iron-rich stars (the anomalous stars) into two groups: the AI and the AII, exhibiting light-element abundance distributions similar to 1P and 2P stars, respectively. The wide extension of our dataset (five times the half-light radius) allowed us to directly and unambiguously compare the fraction of these populations at different radii. We find that 2P and AII stars are more centrally concentrated than the 1P and AI. The remarkable similarities between the 1P-2P and AI-AII radial distributions strongly suggest that these two groups of stars originated from similar mechanisms. Our chemical analysis indicates that the 1P and AI stars (the lower stream) developed their inhomogeneities through core-collapse supernova (and possibly other massive stars') self-enrichment, and that these populations contributed p-capture-processed material to the intracluster medium, from which the chemically extreme 2P and AII stars (the upper stream) formed. Additional polluters, such as intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch stars and Type Ia supernovae, likely played a role in shaping the AII. Finally, we propose that 2P and AII stars with intermediate light-element abundances (the middle stream) formed via dilution between the pure ejecta that created the upper stream and lower-stream material.",

These spectra cover a broad wavelength range of ~3630-10370 A, enabling detection of numerous emission lines critical for nebular analysis, including [O II] 3727 and [O III] 4363 in the blue and [S III] 6312,9069 in the red. Also detected in the spectrum of PNG068.7+14.8 are broad C III and C IV lines probably due to stellar emission, indicating that the central star of this PN is [WC]-type. These GTC optical-IR spectra were analyzed in details in conjunction with the archival Spitzer/IRS mid-IR spectra, and elemental abundances of the two PNe determined. Photoionization models were established for the two PNe using CLOUDY, based on the ratios of line fluxes measured from the GTC optical-NIR spectra. Our best photoionization modeling, in combination with state-of-the-art post-AGB evolutionary model tracks, shows that both PNe evolved from low-mass progenitors (<2 M_sun) with relatively young ages (<3 Gyr), although their central cores are probably in different evolutionary stages - the central star of PNG068.7+14.8 is still in the process of heating up, while that of PNG048.5+04.2 has already entered the white dwarf cooling track. A comparison with AGB model predictions also constrains the progenitors of both PNe to be of low masses. Moreover, the two PNe are in line with the radial oxygen gradients exhibited by the Galactic PN populations, using the most up-to-date distances.",

Ashby 18 pages, 16 figures, Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) A galaxy's mid-IR spectrum encodes key information on its radiation field, star formation, and dust properties. Characterizing this spectrum therefore offers strong constraints on a galaxy's activity. This project describes a diagnostic tool for identifying main-sequence (MS) star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the local Universe using IR dust emission features that are characteristic of galaxy activity. A physically-motivated sample of mock galaxy spectra has been generated to simulate the IR emission of SFGs. Using this sample, we developed a diagnostic tool for identifying MS SFGs based on machine learning methods. Custom photometric bands were defined to target dust emission features, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the dust continuum. Three bands were chosen to trace PAH features at 6.2 {\\mu}m, 7.7 {\\mu}m, 8.6 {\\mu}m, and 11.3 {\\mu}m, along with an additional band to probe the radiation field strength responsible for heating the dust. This diagnostic was subsequently applied to observed galaxies to evaluate its effectiveness in real-world applications. Our diagnostic achieves high performance, with an accuracy of 90.9% on MS SFGs (observed sample of SFGs). Additionally, it shows low contamination, with only 16.2% of AGN galaxies being misidentified as SF. Combining observational data with stellar population synthesis models enables the creation of physically-motivated samples of SFGs that match the spectral properties of real galaxies. By positioning custom photometric bands targeting key dust features, our diagnostic can extract valuable information without the need to measure emission lines. Although PAHs are sensitive indicators of star formation and interstellar medium radiation hardness, PAH emission alone is insufficient for identifying MS SFGs. Finally, we developed a physically-motivated spectral library of MS SFGs spanning from UV to FIR wavelengths.",

Comments are very welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Wide-separation lensed quasars (WSLQs) are a rare subclass of strongly lensed quasars produced by massive galaxy clusters. They provide valuable probes of dark-matter halos and quasar host galaxies. However, only about ten WSLQ systems are currently known, which limits further studies. To enlarge the sample from wide-area surveys, we developed a catalog-based pipeline and applied it to the CatNorth database, a catalog of quasar candidates constructed from Gaia DR3. CatNorth contains 1,545,514 quasar candidates with about 90% purity and a Gaia G-band limiting magnitude of roughly 21. The pipeline has three stages. First, we identify groups with separations between 10 and 72 arcsec using a HEALPix grid with 25.6 arcsec spacing and a friends-of-friends search. We then filter by intra-group color and spectral similarity, reducing the 1,545,514 sources to 14,244 groups while retaining all known, discoverable WSLQs. Finally, a visual check, guided by image geometry and the presence of likely foreground lenses, yields the candidate list with quality labels. We identify 333 new WSLQ candidates with separations from 10 to 56.8 arcsec. Using available SDSS DR16 and DESI DR1 spectroscopy, we uncover two new candidate systems; the remaining 331 candidates lack sufficient spectra and are labeled as 45 grade A, 98 grade B, and 188 grade C. We also compile 29 confirmed dual quasars as a by-product. When feasible, we plan follow-up spectroscopy and deeper imaging to confirm WSLQs among these candidates and enable the related science.",

We select stars that are more metal-rich than the interstellar medium (ISM) at their guiding radius (the so-called Local Metal-Rich stars, LMR) and investigate their chemo-kinematics. Until recently, existing catalogues did not contain such targets in large quantities, but one can now select many millions of them by using Gaia photometric metallicities. Once selected, we investigate their kinematics and age distributions across the disc, and compare them to the stellar populations having the metallicity of the ISM. Compared to locally born stars with [M/H]=[M/H]_ISM, we find that LMR stars, at a given location, are always older (mean age up to 2 Gyr older) and with velocity dispersions similar or slightly higher. Furthermore, at a given [M/H], LMR stars are older at larger galactocentric radiii, reflecting the fact that they need time to migrate. Finally, whereas we do not find any correlation between the location of the spiral arms and the spatial density of LMR stars, we find that the mean stellar eccentricity and mean ages show smaller values where the spiral arms are. Our results confirm a well established theoretical result that has not yet been formally confirmed via observations on large datasets without modelling: churning is not significantly heating the Galactic disc. Furthermore, the age distribution of these stars rule-out any significant contribution from Galactic fountains as their origin, and confirm the effect of the spiral arms on them.",

Re-submitted to A&A after (minor) revision Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) It is well-known that star-forming galaxies (SFGs) exhibit a tight correlation between their radio and infrared emissions, commonly referred to as the infrared-radio correlation (IRRC). Recent empirical studies have reported a dependence of the IRRC on the galaxy stellar mass, in which more massive galaxies tend to show lower infrared-to-radio ratios (qIR) with respect to less massive galaxies. One possible, yet unexplored, explanation is a residual contamination of the radio emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN), not captured through \"radio-excess\" diagnostics. To investigate this hypothesis, we aim to statistically quantify the contribution of AGN emission to the radio luminosities of SFGs located within the scatter of the IRRC. Our VLBA program \"AGN-sCAN\" has targeted 500 galaxies that follow the qIR distribution of the IRRC, i.e., with no prior evidence for radio-excess AGN emission based on low-resolution (~ arcsec) VLA radio imaging. Our VLBA 1.4 GHz observations reach a 5-sigma sensitivity limit of 25 microJy/beam, corresponding to a radio brightness temperature of Tb ~ 10^5 K. This classification serves as a robust AGN diagnostic, regardless of the host galaxy's star formation rate. We detect four VLBA sources in the deepest regions, which are also the faintest VLBI-detected AGN in SFGs to date. The effective AGN detection rate is 9%, when considering a control sample matched in mass and sensitivity, which is in good agreement with the extrapolation of previous radio AGN number counts. Despite the non-negligible AGN flux contamination (~ 30%) in our individual VLBA detections, we find that the peak of the qIR distribution is completely unaffected by this correction. We conclude that residual AGN contamination from non-radio-excess AGN is unlikely to be the primary driver of the M* - dependent IRRC.",

Submitted to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a multiphase, resolved study of the galactic wind extending from the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 4666. For this we use VLT/MUSE observations from the GECKOS program and HI data from the WALLABY survey. We identify both ionised and HI gas in a biconical structure extending to at least $z\\sim$8 kpc from the galaxy disk, with increasing velocity offsets above the midplane in both phases, consistent with a multiphase wind. The measured electron density, using [SII], differs significantly from standard expectations of galactic winds. We find electron density declines from the galaxy centre to $\\sim2$ kpc, then rises again, remaining high ($\\sim100-300$ cm$^{-3}$) out to $\\sim$5 kpc. We find that HI dominates the mass loading. The total HI mass outflow rate (above $z~>2$ kpc) is between $5-13~M_{\\odot}~\\rm yr^{-1}$, accounting for uncertainties from disk-blurring and group interactions. The total ionised mass outflow rate (traced by H$\\alpha$) is between $0.5~M_{\\odot}~\\rm yr^{-1}$ and $5~M_{\\odot}~\\rm yr^{-1}$, depending on $n_e(z)$ assumptions. From ALMA/ACA observations, we place an upper-limit on CO flux in the outflow which correlates to $\\lesssim2.9~M_{\\odot}~\\rm yr^{-1}$. We also show that the entire outflow is not limited to the bicone, but a secondary starburst at the edge generates a more widespread outflow, which should be included in simulations. The cool gas in NGC 4666 wind has insufficient velocity to escape the halo of a galaxy of its mass, especially because most of the mass is present in the slower atomic phase. This strong biconical wind contributes to gas cycling around the galaxy.",

Astron. Telesc. Instrum.

The mission features two advanced instruments: PRIMAger and FIRESS. PRIMAger will operate across the mid- to far-IR spectrum, covering wavelengths from approximately 25 to 260 $\\mu$m. It will offer hyperspectral imaging in medium resolution bands (R $\\sim$ 8, using a linear variable filter) from 25 to 80 $\\mu$m, and broad band (R $\\sim$ 4) photometric and polarimetric imaging in four bands spanning 80 to 260 $\\mu$m. The capabilities of PRIMAger will enable a broad range of unique scientific programs, accessible through General Observer (GO) projects. In this paper, we present and define a PRIMAger survey over 25\\% of the sky, called $\\pi$-IR survey. This survey would exploit PRIMAger's hyperspectral and polarimetric modes to collect data on about 8 $\\times$ 10$^{6}$ galaxies to z $\\sim$ 4. The R=8 spectral resolution of the PRIMAger Hyperspectral Imaging (PHI) filters will enable users to study the emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). A large sample of galaxies will be observed with the polarimetric bands of PRIMAger, allowing unique statistical information for galaxies to be harvested for the first time.",

Xie Submitted to A&A, comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Galaxy properties correlate with their position within the cosmic web. While galaxies are observed in an environment today, they may have experienced different environments in the past. The environmental history, linked to pre-processing, leaves an imprint on the properties of galaxies. We use the GAEA semi-analytic model and IllustrisTNG to reconstruct the environmental histories of galaxies between $z=0$ and $z=4$ that today reside in filaments. Our goal is to understand how galaxy properties are related to their past environments, and the role of the cosmic web in shaping their properties. We find that filament galaxies at $z=0$ are a heterogeneous mix of populations with distinct environmental histories. The vast majority of them have experienced group processing, with only $\\sim$20\\% remaining centrals throughout their life. For $\\rm 9 < \\log_{10}(M_{star}/M_{sun}) < 10$ galaxies, models confirm that the environmental effects are primarily driven by group processing: satellites stop growing stellar mass and exhibit elevated quenched fractions, whereas filament galaxies remain centrals have properties that are similar to field galaxies. Massive galaxies ($\\rm \\log_{10}(M_{star}/M_{sun}) > 10$) that have never been satellites and entered filaments more than 9 Gyr ago show accelerated stellar mass assembly and higher quenched fractions relative to the field, due to a higher frequency of merger events inside filaments, even at fixed mass. The most massive $\\rm \\log ((M_{star} / M_{sun}) > 11$) galaxies accreted onto filaments over 9 Gyr ago, highlighting the role of filaments in building up the high-mass end of the galaxy population. Filaments regulate galaxy evolution in a mass-dependent way: group environments regulate low-mass galaxies, while filaments favour the growth of massive galaxies.",

As merging nuclei approach each other, the physical properties of the participating galaxies and the associated SMBH growth are expected to evolve significantly. This study measures and characterizes these physical properties throughout the merger sequence. We constructed multiwavelength Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) from hard X-rays to the far-infrared (FIR) for a sample of 72 nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) host galaxies. The sample comprises 64 interacting systems, including single AGNs in mergers and dual AGNs, with nuclear separations $\\leq$30 kpc, as well as eight isolated active galaxies with merging features. We carefully adapted available photometric measurements at each wavelength to account for their complex morphologies and varying spatial resolutions, to perform SED fitting using CIGALE, aimed to derive critical physical properties. Our results reveal that merging galaxies hosting AGN(s) show deviations from the star-forming main sequence, and a wide range of star formation rates (SFRs). Both AGN activity and star formation are significantly influenced by the merger process, but these effects are more prominent in major, mass ratios $<$4:1, interactions. We find that the projected nuclear separation is not a good tracer of the merger stage. Instead, morphological classification accurately assesses the merger progression. Based on this morphological analysis, late-stage mergers exhibit elevated SFRs (5.1$\\times$), AGN luminosities (2.4$\\times$), and nuclear obscuration (2.8$\\times$) compared to earlier stages, supporting previous findings and reinforcing the link between merger-driven galaxy evolution and SMBH growth.",

Church Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We investigate the young stellar cluster population of M51 and how it is affected by encounters with giant molecular clouds (GMCs). We combine a galactic model with $N$-body simulations of 5000 unique clusters in the mass range [600 - 24000] $M_{\\odot}$. We simulate each cluster twice: with ($C_R$) and without ($C_N$) tidal perturbations from the GMCs. We are able to reproduce the majority of the observed mass- and age functions. However, for the age function we see a large discrepancy for clusters with masses $\\sim$ 5000 $M_{\\odot}$, which is likely related to incompleteness in the observations. We find that old low-mass clusters, located close to the galactic centre, are most likely to be disrupted. The effect of GMC encounters causes a decrease in survivability by 8 per cent points for the oldest clusters with initial masses below 6000 $M_{\\odot}$. For 15 clusters we find that the presence of GMCs can protect the $C_R$ clusters from the rest of the galactic tidal field and thereby cause them to retain a significantly higher fraction of stars compared to the $C N$ clusters. For clusters that are super-virialized we find that the $C_R$ clusters have a higher virial ratio compared to the $C_N$ clusters, which is a result of interactions with GMCs. We see no significant difference between the $C_R$ and $C_N$ populations, indicating that over a time period of 200 Myr the effect of the GMCs cannot be detected.",

Spekkens Accepted by MNRAS; 14 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) As part of the pilot survey of the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Survey (WALLABY), high-resolution neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) observations of the dwarf galaxy pair NGC 4532/DDO 137 (WALLABY J123424+062511) have revealed a huge (48 kpc) bridge of gas between the two galaxies, as well as numerous arms and clouds which connect with the even longer (0.5 Mpc) tail of gas previously discovered with the Arecibo telescope. Our modelling suggests that a combination of ram pressure and tidal forces are responsible for the nature of the system. Although the pair lies well outside of the virial radius of the Virgo cluster, ram pressure due to infall through an extensive envelope of hot gas around the cluster is most likely responsible for the HI tail. Over a timescale of 1 Gyr, the predicted electron density ($1.2\\times 10^{-5}$ cm$^{-3}$) and infall velocity (880 km s$^{-1}$) are probably sufficient to explain the extensive stripping from the common gaseous envelope of NGC 4532/DDO 137. The ongoing tidal interaction with the Virgo cluster appears to have prevented a rapid merger of the binary pair, with the mutual tidal interaction between the galaxy pair being responsible for raising gas from the outer parts of the galaxy potential wells into the HI bridge and common envelope. The NGC 4532/DDO 137 system mirrors many of the physical features of the Magellanic System, and may lead to a better understanding of that system, as well as casting more light on the relative importance of interaction mechanisms in the outskirts of dynamically young galaxy clusters such as Virgo.",

Our 564 sources at $z=4$--7 have a median stellar mass of $\\log(M_{*}/M_{\\odot})=8.46$ and a median star-formation rate of $\\log(\\mathrm{SFR}/M_{\\odot}\\,\\mathrm{yr^{-1}})=0.30$, placing them close to the star-formation main sequence. We find that the stacked spectrum of all our 564 sources has relatively low [C/O]$=-0.70$, moderate [Ne/O]$=-0.09$, and low [Ar/O]$=-0.28$ values at a low gas-phase metallicity of $12+\\log(\\mathrm{O/H})=7.71$ ($Z\\sim 0.1~Z_\\odot$), suggesting dominant yields of core-collapse supernovae evolved from massive stars. The detection of a weak SiIII] emission line in our stacked spectrum provides a silicon-to-oxygen abundance ratio of [Si/O]$=-0.63$, which is lower than that of stars in the Milky Way disc and lower than expected by chemical evolution models, suggesting silicon depletion onto dust grains. Likewise, this Si/O value is lower than that we newly derive for two individual $z>6$ galaxies (GN-z11 and RXCJ2248) with negligible dust attenuation. By performing spectral stacking in bins of $M_{*}$, SFR, specific SFR (sSFR), and ultra-violet (UV) continuum slope $\\beta_{\\mathrm{UV}}$, we identify [FeIII] line detections in the high-sSFR bin and the blue-$\\beta_{\\mathrm{UV}}$ bin, both of which exhibit supersolar Fe/O ratios, while their C/O, Ar/O, and Si/O ratios are comparable to those of the all-sources stack. Our findings support a chemically young gas composition with rapid dust depletion in the general population of high-$z$ star-forming galaxies, while raising the possibility of anomalous, selective Fe/O enhancement at the very early epoch of star formation.",

Anderson, Mauricio Cruz Reyes, Giordano Viviani Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Recent work has established large samples of astrometrically confirmed RR Lyrae and type-II Cepheid members of Galactic globular clusters (GCs). Any given GC can contain multiple such stars at once, notably RR Lyrae stars pulsating in the fundamental mode (RRab) or the first overtone (RRc), and type-II Cepheids (T2Cep) of BL Her and W Vir types. Here, we present the first joint calibration of the Leavitt laws (LLs) exhibited by 802 RRab, 345 RRc, and 21 T2Cep stars anchored to trigonometric parallaxes. Using the third data release of the ESA Gaia mission (GDR3), we have calibrated the intercepts of the RRab and RRc Leavitt laws in the reddening-free Gaia Wesenheit magnitude to better than 1.0% in distance, and that of T2Cep to 1.3%, using a global fit to all data. The absolute scale is set by 37 nearby GCs with high-accuracy parallaxes while 56 additional GCs provide constraints on LL slopes as well as the LL intercept differences of RRc and T2Cep relative to RRab stars. Our global fit yields homogeneous high-accuracy distances of 93 GCs that show no evidence of bias for Gaia parallaxes of distant GCs. Control of systematics was demonstrated by 31 alternative fit variants, notably involving different treatments of metallicity effects, as well as by Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. Our results suggest that photometric metallicities of RR Lyrae stars require further improvements while also exhibiting possible signs of intra-cluster chemical inhomogeneity. This work lays the foundation for exploiting RRab, RRc, and T2Cep stars as high-accuracy standard candles for near-field cosmology and the extragalactic distance scale.",

This population emerged from a detailed analysis of low-resolution spectroscopic data obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), where the observed frequency trends with the decreasing metallicity of CEMP-s (s-process-enhanced) and CEMP-no (no neutron-capture enhanced) stars deviated from established expectations. In contrast to earlier findings, we observe a rise in high-A(C) stars below [Fe/H] = -3.1, which we interpret as a distinct group not accounted for in traditional CEMP classifications. Following the Yoon-Beers group classification, we define these stars as Group IV. Statistical modeling confirms their presence as a separate peak in the A(C) distribution, and available radial velocity data suggest that about 30% of Group IV stars may be binaries, indicating possible binary-related formation mechanisms. This discovery challenges the current CEMP-no star formation pathways and implies the existence of alternative or hybrid enrichment scenarios in the early Universe. High-resolution spectroscopic follow-up of Group IV candidates will be crucial for identifying their progenitors and understanding their evolutionary implications.",

We find higher Ba, La, and Eu dispersions in the first generation of stars than in the second generation at a significance of $\\ge$2 $\\sigma$. This is evidence for inhomogeneous mixing of gas during the formation of the first generation of stars, which subsequently became well-mixed prior to the formation of the second generation of stars.

We present the Volume Density Mapper, a novel algorithm based on constrained diffusion to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) density distributions of molecular clouds from 2D observations. This method decomposes the column density into multi-scale components, reconstructing a 3D density field that preserves key physical properties such as mean density, maximum density, and standard deviation along the line of sight. Validated against numerical simulations (FLASH and ENZO), the algorithm achieves high accuracy, with mean density estimates within 0.1 dex and dispersions of 0.2 to 0.3 dex across varied cloud structures. The reconstructed 3D density fields enable the derivation of critical parameters, including volume density, cloud thickness, and density probability distribution functions, offering insights into star formation and ISM evolution. The versatility of the method is demonstrated by applying diverse systems from galaxies (NGC 628) to protostellar disks. The code is available at this https URL.",

We find that the evolutionary histories of individual galaxies in the $M_{\\rm BH}$-$M_*$ plane can be decomposed into four distinct phases, separated by three transition points. We identify the driving processes of galaxy evolution within each phase and derive the conditions necessary and sufficient for transitions to subsequent phases. The first phase is dominated by star formation, with its duration primarily determined by the mass of the SMBH seed and the surrounding gas environment. The second phase is characterized by rapid SMBH growth, and the transition to the next phase occurs when the thermal-mode feedback of active galactic nucleus (AGN) can unbind gas from the galaxy. The third phase involves self-regulation of the SMBH, and the transition to the quenched phase occurs when the kinetic-mode feedback of AGN counterbalances gas cooling within the subhalo. The final phase is dominated by mergers. We investigate the use of scaling relations among different mass components and evolutionary phases to understand processes implemented in TNG and other simulations, and discuss how current and forthcoming observations can be used to constrain models.",

Due to the small mass of ULDM, even minor self-interactions can drastically alter these scales in the Thomas-Fermi limit. We suggest that these characteristic scales are connected to mysteries of observed galaxies. Oscillation of ULDM field can explain the current cosmological density of dark matter. Many cosmological constraints suggest that the energy scale $\\tilde{m}$ for self-interacting ULDM is typically of the order $10~eV$, whereas the mass $m$ for the non-interacting case is around $10^{-21}~eV$.

For satellites, a notable importance given by RF to stellar mass implies in-situ pre-quenching rather than ex-situ preprocessing prior to infall to the current host halo.

Several typos fixed; Accepted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We generalize the magnetically enhanced radiative torque (MRAT) alignment theory for general astrophysical environments described by a dimensionless parameter $U/(n_{1}T_{2})$ with $U$ local radiation strength, $n_{1}=n_{\\rm H}/(10{\\rm cm}^{-3})$ the hydrogen density, and $T_{2}=T_{\\rm gas}/100{\\rm K}$ the gas temperature. We first derive the critical magnetic relaxation $\\delta_{\\rm mag,cri}$ required to produce high-J attractors for different RAT models and local conditions and find that $\\delta_{\\rm mag,cri}$ must be larger for stronger radiation fields. We then numerically study the grain alignment and rotational disruption by the MRAT mechanism taking into account gas collisions and magnetic fluctuations. We find that, for the collision-dominated (CD) regime ($U/(n_{1}T_{2})\\leq 1$), collisional and magnetic excitations can slowly transport large grains from low-J rotation to high-J attractors, leading to the perfect {\\it slow alignment} within $\\sim 10-100$ damping times due to MRATs. However, for the radiation-dominated (RD) regime ($U/(n_{1}T_{2})>1$), only a fraction of grains can be fast aligned at high-J attractors by MRATs, and the majority of grains are trapped at low-J rotation due to strong radiative torques, a new effect we term {\\it radiative torque (RAT) trapping}. For extreme radiation fields of $U/(n_{1}T_{2})>10^{4}$, the efficiency of magnetic relaxation on grain alignment is suppressed, and grains only have fast alignment and disruption purely determined by RATs. We quantified the fraction of grains with fast alignment at high-J attractors, $f_{\\rm high-J}^{\\rm fast}$, for different RAT models, magnetic relaxation, and $U/(n_{1}T_{2})$, and found that the maximum $f_{\\rm high-J}^{\\rm fast}$ can reach $45\\%$ by MRATs and $22\\%$ by RATs.",

Moment maps show that both cold and warm molecular gas follow the rotation of the stellar disk along the circumnuclear ring. The ionized gas displays flux and kinematic patterns that depend on ionization potential (IP): low-IP species (<25 eV) trace the disk, while higher-IP lines (up to ~120 eV) trace outflowing material. The [O III]5700 and [Ne V]14 lines both trace the southeast nuclear outflow cone. Additionally, [Ne V]14 detects the northwest counter-cone, obscured in the optical and thus invisible in [O III]5700. Mid-IR diagnostics, unlike optical ones, clearly reveal the AGN as the primary ionization source in the nucleus. Emission from high-IP species is spatially coincident with the ionization cones and not with star-forming regions. Using the [Ne V]24/[Ne V]14 ratio, we derive an electron density of (750+-440) cm^(-3), in agreement with values from the [S II] optical doublet. For the first time, we apply a fully self-consistent approach combining advanced photoionization and kinematic models (HOMERUN+MOKA3D) to constrain intrinsic outflow properties, overcoming the limitations of simplified classical methods. Exploiting the synergy of JWST/MIRI and VLT/MUSE, HOMERUN reproduces fluxes of over 60 emission lines from optical to mid-IR, disentangling AGN and star formation contributions and yielding robust estimates of outflow mass, geometry, and energetics.",

Zavala 22 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present JWST/NIRSpec PRISM observations of three luminous ($M_{\\rm UV}<-20$) galaxies at $z\\sim10$ observed with the CAPERS Cycle 3 program. These galaxies exhibit extreme UV slopes compared to typical galaxies at $z=10$. Of the three sources, two of them are a close pair (0.22 - arcsec) of blue galaxies at $z=9.800\\pm0.003$ and $z=9.808\\pm0.002$ with UV slopes of $\\beta=-2.87\\pm0.15$ and $\\beta=-2.46\\pm0.10$ respectively, selected from PRIMER COSMOS NIRCam imaging. We perform spectrophotometric modeling of the galaxies which suggests extremely young stellar ages and a lack of dust attenuation. For the bluest galaxy, its UV slope also suggests significant Lyman continuum escape. In contrast, the third source (selected from CEERS NIRCam imaging) at $z=9.942\\pm0.002$ exhibits a red UV slope with $\\beta=-1.51\\pm0.08$. We rule out the possibility of a strong nebular continuum due to the lack of a Balmer jump and find no evidence to support the presence of active galactic nucleus continuum due to a lack of strong UV emission lines and no broad component to H$\\gamma$ or H$\\beta$. Instead, it is most likely that the red UV slope is due to dust-reddening ($A_{\\rm V}\\simeq0.9$) implying a significant level of dust-obscured star-formation only $\\simeq480\\, \\rm Myr$ after the Big Bang. Under standard assumptions for dust attenuation, EGS-25297 would be the most intrinsically UV-luminous galaxy ($M_{\\mathrm{UV,corr}}\\simeq -22.4^{+0.7}_{-1.1}$) yet spectroscopically confirmed at $z \\sim 10$. This work highlights that luminous galaxies at $z\\gtrsim10$ have a diversity of dust properties and that spectroscopy of these galaxies is essential to fully understand star-formation at $z\\gtrsim10$.",

Traditional methods, such as spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, can be computationally expensive and may struggle to capture complex galaxy properties. This study aims to develop a robust and efficient machine learning (ML) classification method to identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies within the Farmer COSMOS2020 catalog. We utilized JWST wide-field light cones from the Santa Cruz semi-analytical modeling framework to train a supervised ML model, the CatBoostClassifier, using 28 color features derived from 8 mutual photometric bands within the COSMOS catalog. The model was validated against a testing set and compared to the SED-fitting method in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and execution time. Preprocessing steps included addressing missing data, injecting observational noise, and applying a magnitude cut (ch1 < 26 AB) along with a redshift range of 0.2 < z < 3.5 to align the simulated and observational datasets. The ML method achieved an F1-score of 89\\% for quiescent galaxies, significantly outperforming the SED-fitting method, which achieved 54%. The ML model demonstrated superior recall (88% vs. 38%) while maintaining comparable precision. When applied to the COSMOS2020 catalog, the ML model predicted a systematically higher fraction of quiescent galaxies across all redshift bins within 0.2 < z < 3.5 compared to traditional methods like NUVrJ and SED-fitting. This study shows that ML, combined with multi-wavelength data, can effectively identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies, providing valuable insights into galaxy evolution. The trained classifier and full classification catalog are publicly available.",

We find that the formation of these galaxies follows a two-phase pattern, with an early phase featured by hot dynamics, bulge-dominated structure and bursty star formation, and a later phase featured by cold dynamics, disk-dominated structure and steady star formation. The transition times of these galaxy properties are tightly correlated with the time when the host halo transits from fast to slow accretion, suggesting that the two-phase assembly of halos drive the two-phase formation of galaxies. The physical origin of dynamical hotness can be summarized into two modes of star formation: a scattered mode in which stars form at large radii within cold gas streams associated with fast assembly of halos, and a concentrated mode in which stars form at small radii through violent fragmentation from globally self-gravitated gas when halo assembly is about to slow down. Cold gaseous and stellar disks can form only when the conditions of the two modes are removed by the stall of halo assembly and the reduction of gas by feedback processes. The two modes of star formation leave distinct imprints on the structural properties of high-redshift galaxies, providing implications to be tested by JWST and future observations.",

Zijlstra Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Low- and intermediate-mass stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) account for a significant portion of the dust and chemical enrichment in their host galaxy. Here we present ALMA observations of the continuum emission at 1.24 mm around a sample of 17 stars from the ATOMIUM survey. From our analysis of the stellar contributions to the continuum flux, we find that the semi-regular variables all have smaller physical radii and fainter monochromatic luminosities than the Mira variables. Comparing these properties with pulsation periods, we find a positive trend between stellar radius and period only for the Mira variables with periods above 300 days and a positive trend between the period and the monochromatic luminosity only for the red supergiants and the most extreme AGB stars with periods above 500 days. We find that the continuum emission at 1.2 mm can be classified into four groups. \"Featureless\" continuum emission is confined to the (unresolved) regions close to the star for five stars in our sample, relatively uniform extended flux is seen for four stars, tentative elongated features are seen for three stars, and the remaining five stars have unique or unusual morphological features in their continuum maps. These features can be explained by binary companions to 10 out of the 14 AGB stars in our sample. Based on our results we conclude that there are two modes of dust formation: well established pulsation-enhanced dust formation and our newly proposed companion-enhanced dust formation. If the companion is located close to the AGB star, in the wind acceleration region, then additional dust formed in the wake of the companion can increase the mass lost through the dust driven wind. This explains the different dust morphologies seen around our stars and partly accounts for a large scatter in literature mass-loss rates, especially among semiregular stars with small pulsation periods.",

Current models provide limited insight into how stellar properties, particularly how metallicity and mass, affect RGB mass loss. Here, I introduce a new observational approach that uses the age-velocity-dispersion relation and the lower-mass boundary of red giants as precise evolutionary markers. These markers, informed by Galactic evolution, allow us to construct observational isochrones for field stars. By comparing masses of RGB stars and red clump (RC) stars at the same age in the Kepler sample, I derive empirical measurements of integrated RGB mass loss at several points in age and metallicity. Combining these new observational measurements with open-cluster studies, I showed that the integrated mass loss on the RGB decreases with metallicity, and may also decrease with stellar mass. The average mass-loss rate, which accounts for RGB lifetimes and the initial mass differences between RGB and RC stars at the same age, also shows a similar trend. These findings challenge current mass-loss prescriptions widely adopted in stellar evolutionary models, since none of them is able to produce the observed mass-loss trend without widely adjusting free parameters. This highlights an urgent need to revise mechanisms that govern RGB mass loss.",

With the rapid improvement in technology and different mission requirements, the data products are subject to constant change. However, for long-term studies such as solar variability or multi-instrument investigations, uniform data series are required. In this study, we build on and expand the Instrument-to-Instrument translation (ITI) framework, which provides unpaired image translations. We apply the tool to data from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI), specifically the Full Sun Imager (FSI) on Solar Orbiter (SolO) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). This approach allows us to create a homogeneous data set that combines the two extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imagers. We demonstrate that ITI is able to provide image calibration between SolO and SDO EUV imagers, independent of the varying orbital position of SolO. The comparison of the intercalibrated light curves derived from EUI and AIA shows that ITI can provide uniform data series that outperform a standard baseline calibration. We evaluate the perceptual similarity in terms of the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), which demonstrates that ITI achieves a significant improvement of perceptual similarity between EUI and AIA. The study provides intercalibrated observations from SolO/EUI/FSI with SDO/AIA, enabling a homogeneous data set suitable for solar cycle studies and multi viewpoint investigations.",

Young, Bala Poduval Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) The Energetic Particle Radiation Environment Model (EPREM) solves the focused transport equation (FTE) on a Lagrangian grid in a frame co-moving with the solar wind plasma and simulates the acceleration and transport of solar energetic particles (SEP) in the heliosphere. When not coupled to an external magnetohydrodynamic model, EPREM functions in an uncoupled mode where an ideal cone-shock is injected into a homogeneous background solar wind. We carried out an analysis of the effects of multiple physical parameters in producing widespread SEP events simulated by the uncoupled EPREM using a relatively simple model of a strong magnetized shock propagating radially outward through the inner heliosphere to produce the requisite MHD quantities for EPREM's sophisticated model of proton acceleration and transport. We compared a baseline simulation with seven variations in which the value of a single parameter differed from its baseline value. All simulations exhibit complex profiles of SEP flux as a function of time and energy, with clear dependence on parameters related to diffusion, mean free path, and shock profile. Moreover, while all simulations exhibit significant longitudinal spread in SEP flux, for certain parameter values there exists a decrease or absence in SEP flux at observers located >=90 degrees from the shock origin. Relating the differences in SEP flux to the specific values of each parameter in the simulations provides insight into the morphology of observed SEP events and the state of the solar wind through which the driving CME propagates.",

Making such measurements is important both from a space weather perspective and for understanding the detailed evolution of the CME. In spite of significant efforts and multiple proposed methods, achieving this goal has not been possible to date. Here we report the first possible detection of gyroresonance emission from a CME. Assuming that the emission is happening at the third harmonic, we estimate that the magnetic field strength ranges from 7.9--5.6 G between 4.9-7.5 $R_\\odot$. We also demonstrate that this high magnetic field is not the average magnetic field inside the CME, but most probably is related to small magnetic islands, which are also being observed more frequently with the availability of high-resolution and high-quality white-light images.",

Shkolnik, Joe Llama Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Stellar eruptive events, such as flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), can affect planetary habitability by disturbing the stability of their atmospheres. For instance, strong stellar flares and CMEs can trigger atmospheric escape and, in extreme cases, may strip away the atmosphere completely. While stellar flares have been observed and explored at a wide range of wavelengths, the physical properties of stellar CMEs remain unconstrained due to the difficulty in observing them. In this context, the Sun provides our only window on the potential characteristics of CMEs on Sun-like stars. A correlation between solar X-ray flare peak flux and the mass of flare-associated solar CMEs has been reported using solar data collected during Solar Cycle 23 (1996-2006) (Aarnio et al. 2011). Here, we build upon that work. We extend the correlation into the far-UV (FUV), where stellar flares are and will be routinely detected with existing and future FUV observatories by incorporating data spanning two entire Solar Cycles (23 and 24; 1996-2019). Using three different space missions (CMEs from LASCO/SOHO, X-ray flare events from XRS/GOES, and FUV flares from AIA/SDO), we report a correlation between FUV flare peak flux and energy centered at 1600Å and mass, kinetic energy, and linear speed of flare-associated CMEs. These empirical relations enable estimates of CME masses and kinetic energies from FUV flares on Sun-like stars. While direct stellar-CME detections remain elusive, the correlations derived here are likely applicable to Sun-like stars and provide a working framework for evaluating exoplanet atmospheric erosion.",

This study is based on high-resolution optical spectra obtained with ESPaDOnS at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. We first calculated the average chemical element abundance, the rotational velocity, and the radial velocity of the stars using the ZEEMAN2 spectrum synthesis code with the PHOENIX model atmospheres. We then studied the abundances of titanium and iron inferred from individual lines in the spectra of each star and their variations with their predicted formation depths $\\tau_{\\rm 5000}$. Similarly to the BHB stars cooler than 11500~K observed in globular clusters, no clear observational evidence of vertical stratification is detected in the atmosphere of these stars. In the second part of this project, we searched for the presence of a magnetic field in the stars applying the Least-Squares Deconvolution technique on the Stokes $I$ and $V$ spectra. The measured mean longitudinal magnetic field uncertainties, ranging from 8 to 30~G, effectively rule out the presence of an organized magnetic field in these targets with a strength larger than a few 100~G.",

In this study, we report on two consecutive heliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossings by Parker Solar Probe (PSP), separated by ~10.5 hours, at a heliocentric distance of ~12 solar radii. For each crossing, we identified a series of flux ropes embedded within reconnection exhausts on the sunward side of X-line. Their passage durations are <20sec, corresponding to spatial scales of a few thousands kilometers, still larger by three orders of magnitude than ion inertial length. This identification was possible particularly during intervals when PSP was closest to the HCS center. These flux ropes are distinguishable from the background exhausts by enhancements in magnetic field strength, significantly in the guide field component, travel speed slightly faster (typically by <10km/s) than surrounding outflows, and often accompanied by, though not always, increased density and reduced temperature. We attribute their origin to secondary reconnection within the exhausts and subsequent merging of smaller flux ropes into larger structures, consistent with predictions by various simulations. We suggest that such flux ropes are most readily identifiable at the HCS center where the background magnetic field is weakest so that the relative enhancement in flux rope field becomes most prominent. This observational advantage is particularly notable closer to the Sun where the high ambient magnetic field strength can otherwise obscure such structures unless the spacecraft trajectory remains within the HCS central region for a sufficient duration.",

We characterized the system by analysing the photometric observations from the Solaris network, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, and the Super Wide Angle Search for Planets survey, combined with the radial velocities from four high-resolution spectrographs: HARPS, FEROS, CHIRON, and HRS. We derived the parameters of the eclipsing components, which are $M_{\\rm Aa} = 1.004^{+0.027}_{-0.026}\\,$M$_\\odot$, $R_{\\rm Aa} = 1.007\\pm0.021\\,$R$_\\odot$, and $T_{\\rm eff,Aa} = 5379\\pm289\\,$K for the primary, and $M_{\\rm Ab} = 0.985^{+0.024}_{-0.025}\\,$M$_\\odot$, $R_{\\rm Ab} = 1.024\\pm0.023\\,$R$_\\odot$, and $T_{\\rm eff,Ab} = 5322\\pm278\\,$K for the secondary. We determined the age of the system from the observed parameters using two evolution codes, MESA and Cesam2k20. We obtained an age of $\\sim$28$\\,$Myr, placing the two stars at the very end of the pre-main-sequence phase. We also derived the minimum mass and orbital period of the tertiary companion, which are found to be $M_{\\rm B} = 89.0\\pm3.5\\,$M$_{\\rm Jup}$ and $P_{\\rm AB} = 23.79 ^{+0.10 }_{-0.25}\\,$yr, respectively. We conclude that RX Gru consists of a tight inner binary composed of two twin components and an outer low-mass companion (a massive brown dwarf or a very low-mass star) in a relatively wide orbit, and we suggest that the system was formed via the dynamical unfolding mechanism coupled with the shared accretion of the circumbinary material by the binary components.",

Through inspecting the light variations, we estimate the fractions of reflection effect systems detected in different subclasses of hot subdwarfs and constrain their possible formation channels. We noticed that none of the helium-rich hot subdwarfs were found with the reflection effect. Most of them might form through the merger channel. About 13\\% of the He-poor hot subdwarfs on the extreme horizontal branch (EHB) with $T_{\\rm eff}$ $\\sim$ 25,000 -- 33,000 K are discovered with the reflection effect. Nevertheless, the cooler hot subdwarfs located on the top of the EHB, those grouped on the bottom of the EHB, and those located above the EHB with $T_{\\rm eff}$ $\\sim$ 45,000 -- 75,000 K exhibit lower fractions of reflection effect systems of about 2\\%. These three subclasses of hot subdwarfs might contain higher fractions of single stars. Hot subdwarfs below the EHB also show a low fraction of reflection effect systems. They might have a higher fraction of stars with close WD companions. A similar fraction of reflection effect systems to those on the EHB with $T_{\\rm eff}$ $\\sim$ 25,000 -- 33,000 K is found in hot subdwarfs located above the EHB with $T_{\\rm eff}$ $\\sim$ 35,000 -- 45,000 K.

Comments are welcome Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) One prominent feature of solar cycle is its irregular variation in its cycle strength, making it challenging to predict the amplitude of the next cycle. Studies show that fluctuations and nonlinearity in generating poloidal field throughout the decay and dispersal of tilted sunspots produce variation in the solar cycle. The flux, latitudinal position, and tilt angle of sunspots are the primary parameters that determine the polar field and, thus, the next solar cycle strength. By analysing the observed sunspots and polar field proxy, we show that the nonlinearity in the poloidal field generation becomes important for strong cycles. Except for strong cycles, we can reasonably predict the polar field at the end of the cycle (and thus the next cycle strength) using the total sunspot area alone. Combining the mean tilt angle and latitude positions with the sunspot area, we can predict the polar field of Cycles 15 -- 24 (or the amplitude of sunspot Cycles 16-25) with reasonable accuracy except for Cycle 23 for which the average tilt angle cannot predict the polar field. For Cycles 15--22, we show that the average tilt angle variation dominates over the latitude variation in determining the polar field of a cycle. In particular, the reduction of tilt in Cycle 19 was the primary cause of the following weak cycle (Cycle 20). Thus, we conclude that tilt quenching is essential in regulating the solar cycle strength in the solar dynamo.",

The solar Alfvén surface is the only such structure that is directly measurable and since 2021, has been routinely measured in situ by NASA's Parker Solar Probe (Parker). We use these unique measurements in concert with Solar Orbiter and L1 in situ data spanning the first half of the Solar Cycle 25 in time and from 0.045 - 1 au in heliocentric distance to develop a radial scaling technique to estimate the morphology of the Alfvén surface from measurements of the solar wind speed and local Alfvén speed. We show that accounting for solar wind acceleration and mass flux is necessary to achieve reasonable agreement between the scaled location of the Alfvén surface and the locations of direct crossings measured by Parker. We produce continuous 2D equatorial cuts of the Alfvén surface over half a Solar Cycle (ascending phase and maximum). Parker's earliest crossings clipped outward extrusions, many of which are likely transient related, while more recently Parker has unambiguously sampled deep sub-Alfvénic flows. We analyze the average altitude, departure from spherical symmetry, and surface roughness, finding that all are positively correlated to solar activity. For the current modest Solar Cycle, the height varies up to 30\\% which corresponds to a near-doubling in angular momentum loss per unit mass loss.",

Comments are welcome Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Bipolar Magnetic Regions (BMRs) that appear on the solar photosphere are surface manifestations of the solar internal magnetic field. With modern observations and continuous data streams, the study of BMRs has moved from manual sunspot catalogs to automated detection and tracking methods. In this work, we present an additional module to the existing BMR tracking algorithm, AutoTAB, that focuses on identifying emerging signatures of BMRs. Specifically, for regions newly detected on the solar disk, this module backtracks the BMRs to their point of emergence. From a total of about 12000 BMRs identified by AutoTAB, we successfully backtracked 3080 cases. Within this backtracked sample, we find two distinct populations. One group shows the expected behaviour of emerging regions, in which the magnetic flux increases significantly during the emerging phase. The other group consists of BMRs whose flux, however, does not exhibit substantial growth during their evolution. We classify these as non-emerging BMRs and examine their statistical properties separately. Our analysis shows that these non-emerging BMRs do not display any preferred tilt angle distribution nor show systematic latitudinal tilt dependence, in contrast to the trends typically associated with emerging BMRs. This indicates that including such regions in statistical studies of BMR properties can distort or mask the underlying physical characteristics. We therefore emphasise the importance of excluding the non-emerging population from the whole dataset when analysing the statistical behaviour of BMRs.",

The prominence lifts off and propagates nonradially in the southeast direction. Using the revised cone model, we carry out three-dimensional reconstructions of the icecream-like prominence. The latitudinal inclination angle decreases from $\\sim$60$\\degr$ to $\\sim$37$\\degr$, indicating that the prominence tends to propagate more radially. The longitudinal inclination angle almost keeps constant (-6$\\degr$). The highly inclined prominence eruption and the related CME drive an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wave, which propagates southward at speeds of $\\sim$381.60 km s$^{-1}$ and $\\sim$398.59 km s$^{-1}$ observed in 193 Å and 304 Å, respectively. The M3.5 class flare presents quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in soft X-ray, hard X-ray, EUV, and radio wavelengths with periods of 80$-$120 s. Cotemporary with the flare QPPs, a thin current sheet and multiple plasmoids are observed following the eruptive prominence. Combining with the appearance of drifting pulsation structure, the QPPs are most probably generated by quasi-periodic magnetic reconnection and particle accelerations as a result of plasmoids in the current sheet.",

Here we compare the ion-scale density fluctuation levels inferred from the properties of solar radio bursts with the magnetic field fluctuation levels obtained through in-situ measurements in the inner heliosphere. We find that the observed magnetic and density fluctuation amplitudes are consistent with excitation by kinetic Alfvén waves and/or KAW structures over broad range of distances from the Sun. We then use the radio diagnostics and the KAW scenario to deduce the radial variation of magnetic fluctuation amplitudes in regions close to the Sun where in-situ measurements cannot be obtained. Further, we calculate the energy cascade rate (plasma heating rate) profile over a region that extends from the low corona ($\\sim 0.1$~R$_\\odot$) into the heliosphere (out to $\\sim 1$~au), and compare it to the energy deposition rate required to drive the solar wind. The cascade rate agrees with the available in-situ measurements and also provides predictions closer than $\\sim 10$~R$_\\odot$ where in-situ approaches are not available. The results provide unique diagnostics of the ion-scale plasma turbulence amplitude and energy cascade rate spanning over three orders of magnitude in solar distance.",

Larsen, James MacDonald 9 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in PASP Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The convective kissing instability (CKI) is postulated to occur in low mass stars around the fully convective transition. Non-equilibrium $^{3}$He burning leads to the merging of core and envelope convective zones, which causes abrupt decreases in the stellar radius. It has been suggested by van Saders & Pinsonneault (2012) that these effects may be relevant for cataclysmic variables (CVs). We have performed stellar evolution modeling to study the role of the CKI in CV evolution. We find that the CKI has no effect on normal CVs which evolve via magnetic braking and gravitational radiation above the period gap. CKI cycles either do not occur or are abruptly halted once mass transfer begins. If only gravitational radiation is considered, the CKI does occur. The abrupt radius changes can cause detachment phases which produce small period gaps with widths of a few minutes. We describe how the size of the period gaps is controlled by the $^{3}$He profiles of the secondaries. We also discuss how the results of this study apply to the evolution of strong field polars, where the magnetic field of the white dwarf is strong enough to suppress magnetic braking.",

G. Vivien Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Context. In the search for exoplanets using radial velocities (RV), stellar activity has become one of the main limiting factors for detectability. Fortunately, activity-induced RV signals are wavelength-dependent or chromatic, unlike planetary signals. This study exploits the broad spectral coverage provided by the combined use of SOPHIE and SPIRou velocimeters to investigate the chromatic nature of the activity signal of the highly active M dwarf EV Lac. Aims. We aim to understand the origin of the strong wavelength dependence (chromaticity) observed in the RV signal of EV Lac by selecting spectral lines based on physical properties. In particular, we explore the impact of starspots by defining the contrast effect at the level of individual lines. The Zeeman effect is also considered in this study. Methods. SPIRou and SOPHIE spectra were reduced using the line-by-line (LBL) method. We performed custom RV calculations, using groups of spectral lines selected for their sensitivity to either the spot-to-photosphere contrast or the Zeeman effect. The sensi- tivity of each line to the spot is defined using a two-temperature model based on PHOENIX spectra, while Landé factors were used to quantify Zeeman sensitivity. Results. We find that the spectral lines are distributed in two distinct families of contrasts, producing anti-correlated RV signals. This leads to a partial cancellation of the total RV signal, especially at longer wavelengths and provides a natural explanation for the strong chromaticity observed in EV Lac. This sign-reversal effect is demonstrated here, for the first time, on empirical data. Building on this discovery, we propose a new approach to constraining spot temperatures and to mitigating stellar activity. This will open up promising avenues for improving activity corrections and enhancing the detection of exoplanets around active M dwarfs.",

Innocenti Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) Context. In a previous paper (Afify et al. 2024), we have investigated the stability threshold of the ion-ion acoustic instability (IIAI) in parameter regimes compatible with recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP, (Fox et al. 2016)) observations, in the presence of a Maxwellian electron distribution. We found that observed parameters are close to the instability threshold, but IIAI requires a higher electron temperature than observed. Aims. As electron distributions in the solar wind present clear non-Maxwellian features, we investigate here if deviations from the Maxwellian distribution could explain the observed IIAI. We address specifically the kappa ( $\\kappa$ ) and core-strahl distributions for the electrons. Methods. We perform analytical studies and kinetic simulations using a Vlasov-Poisson code in a parameter regime relevant to PSP observations. The simulated growth rates are validated against kinetic theory. Results. We show that the IIAI threshold changes in the presence of $\\kappa$ or core-strahl electron distributions, but not significantly. In the latter case, the expression of an effective temperature for an equivalent Maxwellian electron distribution given in Jones et al. (1975) is confirmed by simulations. Such an effective temperature could simplify stability assessment of future observations.",

Chen, Davide Manzini Space Physics (physics.space-ph); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) The nature of turbulence at sub-electron scales has remained an open question, central to understanding how electrons are heated in the solar wind. This is primarily because spacecraft measurements have been limited to magnetic field fluctuations alone. We resolve this by deriving new high-resolution density fluctuations from spacecraft potential measurements of Parker Solar Probe resolving scales smaller than the electron gyro-radius ($\\rho_e$). A systematic comparison of the density and magnetic spectra shows that both steepen near the electron scales. Notably, the density spectrum exhibits slopes close to $-10/3$, while the magnetic spectrum becomes consistently steeper than the density spectrum at scales smaller than $\\rho_e$, indicating that the turbulence becomes electrostatic. These results are consistent with theoretical predictions of an electron entropy cascade, which may explain the irreversible dissipation of turbulent energy at sub-$\\rho_e$ scales.",

Constraining the planet formation processes in multiple stellar systems is then key to understand the global exoplanet population. This study focuses on investigating the dust reservoir within the triple system V892 Tau. Our objective is to establish constraints on the properties and characteristics of the dust present in the system's circumbinary ring. Based on archival ALMA and VLA data from 0.9 mm to 9.8 mm, we present a multi-wavelength analysis of the ring of V892 Tau. We first studied the spatial variation of the spectral index, before employing 3D full radiative transfer calculations to constrain the ring's geometry and the radial dependence of the dust grain properties. Spectral indices are consistent with non-dust emission in the vicinity of the central binary, and with dust emission in the ring likely remaining optically thick up to 3.0 mm. Our radiative transfer analysis supports these interpretations, yielding a model that reproduces the observed intensities within the 1-sigma uncertainties across all wavelengths. The resulting dust surface density and temperature profiles both decrease with increasing radius, and are in agreement with values reported in the literature. Maximum grain sizes are constrained to 0.2 cm, with a size distribution power-law index -3.5. These results imply that the dust grain fragmentation velocity does not exceed 8 m/s. Whilst our results suggest dust trapping at the cavity edge, they also suggest that tidal perturbations triggered by the central binary limit grain growth within the ring. This highlights the need to further constrain planet formation efficiency in multiple stellar systems, a goal that may be advanced by applying the methodology of this work to a wider sample of systems.",

The Gnevyshev-Ohl Rule and its Generation Mechanism Zi-Fan Wang, Jie Jiang, Jing-Xiu Wang 20 pages, 7 figures, accepted by Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The Gnevyshev-Ohl (G-O) rule, or even-odd effect, is an important observational phenomenon in solar cycles, originally suggesting that even-numbered cycles are typically followed by stronger odd-numbered ones. However, subsequent studies have reported varied forms and often conflicting manifestations of this rule, along with diverse interpretations of its physical origin. Using an observation-based iterative map, we investigate these different forms of the G-O rule and propose a more general underlying rule: statistically, a given solar cycle is more likely to be followed by a stronger one, regardless of even-odd numbering. This transition asymmetry arises from the map's inherent asymmetry relative to the diagonal. Over timescales comparable to historical observations, both the G-O rule and its reversal can arise randomly, without a consistent preference. The short-term behavior of the rule is sensitive to the initial cycle, the selected time interval, and the parameters of the recursion function. These findings reconcile previously conflicting reports and point to a general generation mechanism: G-O-like behavior arises naturally from nonlinear stochastic dynamics. While different recursion parameters may lead to varying short-term patterns and statistical strengths, the emergence of G-O-like features appears to be a generic property of such systems.",

Buchhave Accepted for publication in ApJS; 20 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) As the field of exoplanetary astronomy has matured, demand has grown for precise stellar abundances to probe subtle correlations between stellar compositions and planetary demographics. However, drawing population-level conclusions from the disparate measurements in the literature is challenging, with various groups measuring metallicities using bespoke codes with differing line lists, radiative transfer models, and other assumptions. Homogeneous analyses are thus critical. Here we use the neural-net framework uberMS to measure iron abundances and alpha enrichments from high-resolution optical spectra observed by the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph (TRES), a key resource used for the follow-up of candidate exoplanet hosts. To contextualize these measurements and benchmark our method's performance, we compare to external constraints on metallicity using the Hyades cluster, wide binaries, and asteroids, to external constraints on $T_{\\rm eff}$ and $\\log g$ using stars with interferometric radii, and to the results of other abundance measurement methods using overlap samples with the APOGEE and SPOCS catalogs, as well as by applying the SPC method directly to TRES spectra. We find that TRES-uberMS provides reliable parameter estimates with errors of roughly 100 K in $T_{\\rm eff}$, 0.09 dex in $\\log g$, and 0.04 dex in [Fe/H] for many nearby dwarf stars, although [Fe/H] performance is poorer for mid-to-late K dwarfs, with the bias worsening with decreasing $T_{\\rm eff}$. Performance is also worse for evolved stars. For [$\\alpha$/Fe], our error may be as good as 0.03 dex for dwarfs based on external benchmarks, despite sizable and variable systematic differences when comparing with specific alpha-element abundances from other catalogs.",

With data from the Very Large Array and the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we analyze the spectral index, morphology and multiplicity of the detected radio sources. The high-sensitivity, high-resolution observations allow us to resolve many sources; 65$\\%$ of the reported sources are resolved at least within the synthesized beam. We report thirteen new detections and two previously known detections that we observed for the first time in radio frequencies. We use the observations to build radio spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to calculate spectral indices. With radio morphologies and the spectral indices, we give assessments on the nature of the sources, highlighting six sources that display a radio jet-like morphology and a spectral index consistent with ionized jets. Combining with the SOMA Radio I sample, we present the radio - bolometric luminosity relation, especially probing the regime from $L_{\\rm bol}\\sim 10^4$ to $10^6\\:L_\\odot$.

Each light curve is carefully scrutinized and its properties are summarized in a set of five parameters. One of these, which measures the relative width of the light maxima and minima, is found to be particularly efficient at revealing significant correlations with the current state of the star on the AGB. The picture that had been sketched in an earlier work is clarified and new features are revealed. In particular, the evolution on the AGB of stars having not yet experienced a third dredge-up event is shown to go together with a closely related path followed by the light curve in the parameter space. Moreover, evidence is found for the existence of two different types of light curves for stars having experienced dredge-up events strong enough for their impact to be detectable. For some, probably associated with higher initial mass stars, the light maximum becomes broader as the star evolves along the AGB, while for others it becomes narrower. Interpretations are proposed, however often too speculative to be firmly ascertained: the results presented raise several unanswered questions and point to the need for new observations and analyses, suggesting that light curves still carry more messages and information than has been currently possible to decrypt.",

On the Sun, granular-scale vortex flows couple strongly with magnetic fields, channeling energy into the corona. At high Reynolds numbers, vorticity and magnetic fields are nearly frozen into the charged fluid, and MHD flows emerge from the Lorentz force mediated interactions between coherent vortex structures in matter and the field. To probe this competition in a controlled setting, we revisit the canonical problem of two antiparallel flux tubes. By varying the magnetic flux threading each tube--and thus sweeping the interaction parameter $N_i$, which gauges Lorentz-to-inertial force balance--we uncover three distinct regimes: vortex-dominated joint reconnection, instability-triggered cascade, and Lorentz-induced vortex disruption. At low $N_i$, classical vortex dynamics dominate, driving joint vortex-magnetic reconnection and amplifying magnetic energy via a dynamo effect. At moderate $N_i$, the system oscillates between vorticity-driven attraction and magnetic damping, triggering instabilities and nonlinear interactions that spawn secondary filaments and drive an energy cascade. At high $N_i$, Lorentz forces suppress vortex interactions, aligning the tubes axially while disrupting vortex cores and rapidly converting magnetic to kinetic energy. These findings reveal how the inertial-Lorentz balance governs energy transfer and coherent structure formation in MHD turbulence, offering insight into vortex-magnetic coevolution in astrophysical plasmas.",

This question is crucial because such sub-Neptune-sized planets are among the most common in our galaxy, yet we have no analog in our own solar system, making them a key to understanding planet formation and diversity. It also directly impacts the search for habitable worlds: larger-than-Earth planets with solid surfaces or oceans could support life, whereas gas-rich mini-Neptunes likely cannot. However, distinguishing these types using only a planet's mass and radius is very challenging, because different compositions can produce similar densities, leaving a world's nature ambiguous with current data. The proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), a future NASA flagship telescope, offers a solution. HWO could directly image and spectroscopically analyze starlight reflected from 50~100 sub-Neptunes around nearby stars, aiming to reveal their atmospheric compositions and potential surfaces. Using visible and near-infrared spectroscopy along with sensitive polarimetry, HWO would detect atmospheric gases (such as water vapor, methane, and carbon dioxide) and search for telltale surface signatures, including rock absorption features and the characteristic reflectivity patterns of oceans. By analyzing these signals, we could determine whether sub-Neptunes are large rocky planets or water worlds rather than gas-dominated mini-Neptunes. Crucially, expanding the search beyond Earth-sized planets to include these abundant sub-Neptunes may uncover entirely new classes of potentially habitable worlds, directly advancing HWO's mission to identify and characterize planets that could support life.",

The LNA closely interfaces to a custom-made antenna feed with an impedance co-designed to provide noise matching over a 5:1 bandwidth. Additionally, a method of broadband noise and power matching that allows the input impedance to be controlled independently from the optimum signal-source impedance to achieve minimum noise is also discussed. When measured in a 50-\\Omega system, the LNA exhibits a return loss (RL) of > 8 dB between 0.32 to 1.5 GHz, S21 of 32 dB \\pm 1.2 dB, IP1dB > -37 dBm, and IIP3 > -20 dBm.

These effects reduce the signal entering the spectrograph and introduce systematic errors in radial velocity measurements. To address this challenge, atmospheric dispersion correctors are utilised. However, many existing designs of these correctors, which are based on theoretical models, often lack practical validation and consistency. The forthcoming National Large Optical Telescope (NLOT) will be installed at Hanle, a site known for its favourable astronomical sky conditions. Thus, the design of an effective dispersion corrector for the instruments on the NLOT, specifically one that compensates for the measured dispersion, is crucial. For the first time, we have directly measured atmospheric dispersion at the Hanle site using the Himalayan Faint Object Spectrograph mounted on the Himalayan Chandra Telescope. In this study, we present our methodology, the dispersion measurements obtained within the 400 to 700 nm wavelength range, and a comparison with modelled dispersion values.",

Comments welcome Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Black hole population studies are currently performed either using astrophysically motivated models (informed but rigid in their functional forms) or via non-parametric methods (flexible but not directly interpretable). In this paper, we present a statistical framework to complement the predictive power of astrophysically motivated models with the flexibility of non-parametric methods. Our method makes use of the Dirichlet distribution to robustly infer the relative weights of different models as well as of the Gibbs sampling approach to efficiently explore the parameter space. After having validated our approach using simulated data, we apply this method to the BBH mergers observed during the first three Observing Runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration using both phenomenological and astrophysical models as parametric models, finding results in agreement with the currently available literature.",

In order to explore implications of this emerging change in the HPC landscape for radio astronomy, we report results from a survey conducted via semi-structured interviews with 14 Australian scientists and providers with experience of commercial HPC in astronomy and similar data intensive fields. We supplement these data with learnings from two earlier studies in which we investigated the application of commercial HPC to radio astronomy data processing, using cases with very different data and processing considerations. We use the established qualitative research approach of thematic analysis to extract key messages from our interviews. We find that commercial HPC can provide major advantages in accessibility and availability, and may contribute to increasing researchers' career productivity. Significant barriers exist, however, including the need for access to increased expertise in systems programming and parallelisation, and a need for recognition in research funding. We comment on potential solutions to these issues.",

Gia Trinh, Paulina Turekova, Sander ter Veen Under review with Nature Communications Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph) We show that it is possible to locate the few places on the body of an airplane, while it is flying through high clouds, from which broad-band, pulsed, radiation is emitted at Very High Frequency (VHF) radio frequencies. This serendipitous discovery was made whilst imaging a lightning flash using the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR). This observation provides insights into the way the airplane sheds the electrical charge it acquires when flying through clouds. Furthermore, this observation allowed us to test and improve the precision and accuracy for our lightning observation techniques. Our new results indicate that with the improved procedure the location precision for strong pulses is better than 50~cm, with the orientation of linear polarization being accurate to within 25$^\\circ$. For the present case of a Boeing 777-300ER, VHF emissions were observed exclusively associated with the two engines, as well as a specific spot on the tail. Despite the aircraft flying through clouds at an altitude of 8~km, we did not detect any emissions from electrostatic wicks.",

ALMA data and GCM simulations can predict middle atmosphere zonal wind distributions, which in turn produce diagnostic occultation image sequences. We construct an occultation forward model using the temperature profile measured by the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument, which is then distorted using latitudinal zonal wind profiles from the ALMA data or GCM simulations. The occultation forward model yields simulated light distributions around Titan's limb, which we compare directly to the light distributions observed during the occultation. The GCM zonal wind profile corresponding to slightly before the time of the stellar occultation provides the best overall match to the data. The ALMA wind profile provides the best match to the occultation data when only the ingress data were considered, but is not the best match when data from ingress and egress are combined. Our data support the presence of stronger winds in the southern hemisphere during late northern summer.",

While most observations have relied on space facilities such as HST and JWST, ground-based high-resolution transmission spectroscopy (HRTS) has also provided valuable insights by resolving individual atomic features. In this work, we present an initial performance assessment and feasibility test of the Hanle Echelle Spectrograph (HESP) on the 2 m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) for HRTS. As a benchmark, we observed the hot Jupiter HD 209458b during a single transit at a resolution of R = 30,000. We developed a Python-based, semi-automated data reduction and analysis pipeline that includes corrections for telluric contamination and stellar radial velocity shifts. The final achieved signal-to-noise ratio and spectral stability allow us to probe for features at the 0.1% level. This work establishes a methodology and demonstrates the operational capability of the HESP-HCT for obtaining high-resolution transmission spectra.",

Comments from the community are welcome Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Machine Learning (cs.LG) We present RAVEN, a newly developed vetting and validation pipeline for TESS exoplanet candidates. The pipeline employs a Bayesian framework to derive the posterior probability of a candidate being a planet against a set of False Positive (FP) scenarios, through the use of a Gradient Boosted Decision Tree and a Gaussian Process classifier, trained on comprehensive synthetic training sets of simulated planets and 8 astrophysical FP scenarios injected into TESS lightcurves. These training sets allow large scale candidate vetting and performance verification against individual FP scenarios. A Non-Simulated FP training set consisting of real TESS candidates caused primarily by stellar variability and systematic noise is also included. The machine learning derived probabilities are combined with scenario specific prior probabilities, including the candidates' positional probabilities, to compute the final posterior probabilities. Candidates with a planetary posterior probability greater than 99% against each FP scenario and whose implied planetary radius is less than 8$R_{\\oplus}$ are considered to be statistically validated by the pipeline. In this first version, the pipeline has been developed for candidates with a lightcurve released from the TESS Science Processing Operations Centre, an orbital period between 0.5 and 16 days and a transit depth greater than 300ppm. The pipeline obtained area-under-curve (AUC) scores > 97% on all FP scenarios and > 99% on all but one. Testing on an independent external sample of 1361 pre-classified TOIs, the pipeline achieved an overall accuracy of 91%, demonstrating its effectiveness for automated ranking of TESS candidates. For a probability threshold of 0.9 the pipeline reached a precision of 97% with a recall score of 66% on these TOIs. The RAVEN pipeline is publicly released as a cloud-hosted app, making it easily accessible to the community.",

Lett. 135 (Sep, 2025) 121002 Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex) The annual modulation signal, claimed to be consistent with dark matter as observed by DAMA/LIBRA in a sodium-iodide based detector, has persisted for over two decades. COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112 were designed to test the claim directly using the same target material. COSINE-100, located at Yangyang Underground Laboratory in South Korea, and ANAIS-112, located at Canfranc Underground Laboratory in Spain, have been taking data since 2016 and 2017, respectively. Each experiment published its respective results independently. In this paper, we present the results of an annual modulation search as a test of the signal observed by DAMA/LIBRA with the first three respective years of data from COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we find best fit values for modulation amplitude of $-0.0002 {\\pm} 0.0026$ cpd/kg/keV in the 1-6 keV and $0.0021 {\\pm} 0.0028$ cpd/kg/keV in the 2-6 keV energy regions. These results are not compatible with DAMA/LIBRA's assertion for their observation of annual modulation at $3.7{\\sigma}$ and $2.6{\\sigma}$, respectively. Performing a simple combination of the newly released 6-years datasets from both experiments find values consistent with no modulation at $0.0005 {\\pm} 0.0019$ cpd/kg/keV in the 1-6 keV and $0.0027 {\\pm} 0.0021$ cpd/kg/keV in the 2-6 keV energy regions with $4.68{\\sigma}$ and $3.53{\\sigma}$ respective exclusions of the DAMA/LIBRA signal.",

      "abstract": "Identifying close-in Jupiters that arrived via disk migration: Evidence of primordial alignment, preference of nearby companions and hint of runaway migration Yugo Kawai, Akihiko Fukui, Noriharu Watanabe, Sho Fukazawa, Norio Narita 18 pages, 5 Figures, Accepted for publication in AJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Two leading hypotheses for hot Jupiter migration are disk migration and high-eccentricity migration (HEM). Stellar obliquity is commonly used to distinguish them, as high obliquity often accompanies HEM. However, low obliquity does not guarantee disk migration, due to possible spin-orbit realignment or coplanar HEM. Seeking a proxy for disk migration, we investigate the idea that when the circularization timescale of a planet on circular orbit is longer than its age ($\\tau_\\mathrm{cir} > \\tau_\\mathrm{age}$), HEM would not have had sufficient time to complete, favoring disk migration. We empirically calibrate the reduced planetary tidal quality factor to be $Q_\\mathrm{p}=4.9^{+3.5}_{-2.5}\\times10^5$ using the eccentricity distribution of 500+ Jovian mass ($0.2M_\\mathrm{J}<M_\\mathrm{p}<13M_\\mathrm{J}$) planets with measured masses and radii, a value consistent with solar system Jupiter. We then calculate $\\tau_\\mathrm{cir}$ and identify dozens of disk migration candidates ($\\tau_\\mathrm{cir} > \\tau_\\mathrm{age}, \\ e < 0.1$). These planets show three notable trends. We first find a clear cutoff of obliquity at $\\tau_\\mathrm{cir} \\sim \\tau_\\mathrm{age}$, suggesting the primordial alignment of protoplanetary disks. Secondly, we find that among hot Jupiters ($a<0.1$ au), nearby companions are preferentially found around disk migration candidates, suggesting that either HEM dominates hot Jupiter formation, or disk migration also disrupts nearby companions at short separations. Finally, we find a possible dearth of disk migration candidates around mass ratio $\\log q \\sim -3.2$, consistent with a similar dip suggested at longer orbits from microlensing. The lack of planets across different orbital distance, if true, could be interpreted as a hint of runaway migration.",

Bott, Connor J. Vancil, Maxwell A. Millar-Blanchaer, Nicholas F. Wogan, Eric T. Wolf 23 pages, 17 figures. Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Determining the habitability of terrestrial exoplanets is a complex problem that represents the next major step for the astrophysical community. The majority of current models treat these planets as homogeneous or contain heterogeneity that is constant in time. In reality, habitable exoplanets are expected to contain atmospheric and surface heterogeneities similar to Earth, with diurnal rotation, seasonal changes, and weather patterns resulting in complex, time-dependent signatures. Due to its ability to measure light as a vector, polarimetry provides an important tool that will enhance the characterizations of heterogeneous worlds. Here we model the visible to near-infrared linear spectropolarimetric signatures, as functions of wavelength and planetary phase angle, of various heterogeneous Earth scenarios as well as the first signals of an early wet and potentially habitable Mars. The contributions from the different atmospheric and surface properties result in asymmetric phase curves and variable spectra, with the polarization appearing to be more sensitive than flux to heterogeneities such as patchy clouds and continents moving into and out-of-view. Our models provide important predictions of expected polarized and unpolarized signatures of heterogeneous exoplanets that will help guide the designs and observing plans of future polarimeters, including those proposed for the upcoming Habitable Worlds Observatory.",

Accepted for publication in PASP Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Many potential direct imaging candidates suffer from large orbital period uncertainties, leading to challenges in accurate predictions of future orbital positions and imprecise direct imaging measurements of planetary parameters. To improve the precision in orbital properties, precursor radial velocity (RV) follow-up observations for selected candidates are essential. This study examines the impact of three variables on the orbital period uncertainties of long-period giant planets: the number of future observations, the temporal gap between past and future data, and the temporal coverage of upcoming observations. Our simulations indicate that the orbital phases at which future RV observations are acquired play a significant role in reducing period uncertainties. Additionally, observing too frequently within a given time frame adds limited value to the program once a certain number of observations has been achieved. The temporal gap proves to be the most important factor when there is no strict end time to the observing campaign. However, if a strict end time is set, starting observations earlier yields improved reductions in orbital period uncertainty. These insights offer practical guidance for planning efficient RV follow-up campaigns to maximize the science yield of future space-based direct imaging missions.",

Pierrehumbert, Emma Postolec, Samuel Boucher, Alex McGinty, Bo Peng, Diana Valencia, Mark Hammond Accepted in ApJL September 20, 2025 Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Ultra-short period (USP) exoplanets -- with $R_p \\leq 2~$R$_{\\oplus}$ and periods $\\leq$1 day -- are expected to be stripped of volatile atmospheres by intense host star irradiation, which is corroborated by their nominal bulk densities and previous eclipse observations consistent with bare rock surfaces. However, a few USP planets appear anomalously under-dense relative to an Earth-like composition, suggesting an exotic interior structure (e.g., core-less) or a volatile-rich secondary atmosphere increasing their apparent radius. Here we present the first dayside emission spectrum of the low density (4.3$\\pm$0.4 g~cm$^{-3}$) ultra-short period planet TOI-561 b, which orbits an iron-poor, alpha-rich, $\\sim$10 Gyr old thick disk star. Our 3-5 $\\mu$m JWST/NIRSpec observations demonstrate the dayside of TOI-561 b is inconsistent with a bare-rock surface at high statistical significance, suggesting instead a thick volatile envelope that is cooling the dayside to well below the $\\sim$3000 K expected in the bare rock or thin atmosphere case. These results reject the popular hypothesis of complete atmospheric desiccation for highly irradiated exoplanets and support predictions that planetary-scale magma oceans can retain substantial reservoirs of volatiles, opening the geophysical study of ultra-hot super-Earths through the lens of their atmospheres.",

However, these methods struggle with overlapping families, interlopers, and the detection of older structures. Spectroscopic data can help overcome these limitations. The Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) contains reflectance spectra at visible wavelengths for 60,518 asteroids over the range between 374-1034 nm, representing a large sample that is well suited to studies of asteroid families. Using Gaia spectroscopic data, we investigate a region in the central Main Belt centered around 2.72 AU, known for its connection to L- type asteroids. Conflicting family memberships reported by different HCM implementations underscore the need for an independent dynamical analysis of this region. We determine family memberships by applying a color taxonomy derived from Gaia data and by assessing the spectral similarity between candidate members and the template spectrum of each family. We identify an L- type asteroid family in the central Main Belt, with (460) Scania as its largest member. Analysis of the family's V-shape indicates that it is relatively old, with an estimated age of approximately 1 Gyr, which likely explains its non detection by the HCM. The family's existence is supported by statistical validation, and its distribution in proper element space is well reproduced by numerical simulations. Independent evidence from taxonomy, polarimetry, and spin-axis obliquities consistently supports the existence of this L- type family. This work highlights the value of combining dynamical and physical data to characterize asteroid families and raises questions about the origin of L- type families, potentially linked to primordial objects retaining early protoplanetary disk properties. Further spectroscopic data are needed to clarify these families.",

Zechmeister Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) CARMENES is a dual-channel high-resolution spectrograph at the 3.5 m Calar Alto telescope designed to detect low-mass planets around late-type dwarfs by measuring their radial velocities (RVs). High thermal stability in both the visible (VIS) and near infrared channels is essential to achieve the precision required for these measurements. In particular, stabilising the NIR channel to the millikelvin level, which operates at cryogenic temperatures (140 K), poses significant engineering this http URL CARMENES-PLUS project was initiated to improve the instruments intrinsic RV precision. In this article, we focus on the thermal stability improvements made to the NIR channels cooling system. The NIR cooling system was originally conceived to operate with a discontinuous flow of cryogenic nitrogen gas. As part of CARMENES-PLUS, this was upgraded to a continuous flow configuration. Additional changes included the installation of an automatic vacuum system, a proportional control valve, and a pressure regulation system. These upgrades were designed to reduce thermal fluctuations and enhance long-term stability. The implemented upgrades significantly improved the intrinsic RV precision of the NIR channel. We quantified this improvement using Fabry Perot calibration spectra, obtaining an intrinsic RV precision of 0.67 ms after the interventions, an improvement of nearly 2 ms . We also assessed the stability of the nightly zero points, finding a reduced scatter of 3.9 ms post upgrade, compared to 6.1 ms before. For a sample of slowly rotating stars (vsin i below 2 kms), the median scatter decreased from 8.8 ms to 6.7 ms after the upgrades. These results demonstrate that the thermal control upgrades introduced in CARMENES PLUS have enhanced the NIR channels RV performance, bringing it closer to the VIS channels stability and reinforcing CARMENES capabilities for exoplanet detection around M dwarfs.",

Two of these, K2-19 b and c, are between the size of Neptune and Saturn and have orbital periods near a 3:2 commensurability, and exhibit strong transit-timing variations (TTVs). A previous TTV analysis reported moderate eccentricities of $\\approx0.20 \\pm0.03$ for the two planets, but such high values would imply rapid orbital decay for the innermost planet d. Here, we present an updated analysis that includes eight new transit times from TESS, which extends the time baseline from three years to a decade, and employ a gradient-aware TTV modeling code. We confirm that the system resides in resonance with a small libration amplitude, but find a broader constraints on eccentricity that range from a few percent up to 0.2. These revised eccentricities alleviate previous concerns regarding rapid tidal circularization and support the long-term dynamical stability of the system.",

A key question regarding the two planets is the similarity of their observed flows despite the great differences in their obliquity and internal heating. To answer this fundamental question and understand the ice giants atmospheric circulation, we developed a new general circulation model (GCM). This tool will also be key to facilitating the success of future missions to the ice giants, for which atmospheric flows will be a measurable quantity. Past GCMs for the ice giants have struggled to reproduce the observed winds on Uranus and Neptune. Using our idealized GCM, we systematically explored how the zonal wind and meridional circulation respond to different model and physical parameters; our main focus was on the depth of the domain. We show that in cases where the bottom layer of the model is deep enough, the simulated flow is independent of the meridional structure of the forcing temperature, indicating that dynamical processes, and not the imposed thermal forcing, are the dominant drivers of the circulation and the thermal structure. A momentum balance analysis further shows that meridional and vertical eddy momentum flux convergence are both central to maintaining the circulation. These results provide a physical explanation for the similarity of the flow on Uranus and Neptune although their solar and internal forcing are significantly different. The modeling framework developed in this study can serve as a foundation for the development of more comprehensive GCMs of the ice giants and help guide the interpretation of future mission data.",
