These results implied that primordial black holes and other compact objects with masses from 10^{-8} to 10^3 M_solar cannot comprise a substantial fraction of the Milky Way dark matter halo. Unfortunately, the Hawkins & Garcia-Bellido post contained a number of scientific misrepresentations of our work. Here, we demonstrate that their arguments lack a solid basis or are simply incorrect. As we show below, \"and yet they are not found\" - compact objects (including primordial black holes) in the dark halo of the Milky Way remain undetected, despite extensive searches.",

In fact, in such gravitational wave detectors even minimal laser power absorption can induce performance-limiting thermal effects. This paper presents a detailed investigation into the steady-state thermal behavior of TTMs. In particular, future scenarios of increased intracavity laser beam power and optical coating absorption are considered. We develop and compare two numerical models: a comprehensive model incorporating volumetric heat absorption in both the multilayer coating and the bulk substrate, and a simplified reduced model where the coating's thermal impact is represented as an effective surface boundary condition on the substrate. Our simulations were focused on a ternary coating design, which is a candidate for use in next-generation detectors. Results reveal that higher coating absorption localizes peak temperatures near the coating--vacuum interface. Importantly, the comparative analysis demonstrates that temperature predictions from the reduced model differ from the detailed model by only milli-Kelvins, a discrepancy often within the experimental uncertainties of the system's thermo-physical parameters. This finding suggests that computationally efficient reduced models can provide sufficiently accurate results for thermal management and first-order distortion analyses. Moreover, the critical role of accurately characterizing the total power absorbed by the coating is emphasized.",

At the final stage of the evolution of such systems, the low-mass neutron star fills its Roche lobe, whereupon its mass is gradually transferred to the more massive component. At a certain point, the stability of the mass transfer is lost, causing the minimum-mass neutron star to explode. In the present stripping calculations, the effect of non-conservative mass transfer has been taken into account for the first time, resulting in an increase in the duration of stable mass transfer from a few tenths of a second to a few seconds. This allows the time delay of 1.7 s between the loss of the gravitational-wave signal and the detection of the gamma-ray burst from the multimessenger event GW170817-GRB170817A to be naturally explained. The interaction of the envelope of the exploded minimum-mass neutron star with the matter ejected during non-conservative mass transfer may explain two episodes in the light curve of this gamma-ray burst.",

DM environments surrounding massive binary black holes (BBHs) modify their orbital dynamics, thereby altering gravitational wave (GW) emissions. For BBH systems at the Galactic Center, dynamical friction induced by DM spikes could produce detectable deviations in GW spectra, potentially observable by future space-based detectors. To address the uncertainties in the Galactic Center's DM profile, we systematically examine two scenarios: the generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (gNFW) profile and its post-spike modification. We investigate the evolutionary effects of DM dynamical friction and accretion on the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum of secondary black holes (BHs) in elliptical orbits. By constructing orbital models with varying initial eccentricities across the mass-semi-latus rectum parameter space and utilizing 30 years of simulated pulsar timing array data from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), we identify detectable parameter regimes of DM effects and employ these GW observational signatures to constrain different DM density profiles. Our analysis reveals that among gNFW profiles ($\\gamma=2,1.5,1,0.5$), only $\\gamma=2$ produces significant detectable signatures. The formation of DM spikes further enhances these observable waveform deviations for all gNFW slopes.",

The dynamics of fragmentation, at least in the context of dark matter production, have so far been studied semi-analytically using perturbation theory. In this work, we present the first classical lattice simulation of kinetic axion fragmentation in the context of dark matter production, focusing on parameters relevant to the QCD axion. Our findings indicate that the non-perturbative dynamics captured by the lattice lead to a significantly broader spectrum of axion fluctuations, with a sustained transfer of energy to mildly relativistic modes and with smaller occupation numbers compared to the linear approximation. As a consequence, the final dark matter abundance is typically O(1) lower than in the linear approximation, which is itself O(1) lower than the zero-mode-only prediction. This broadening and suppression of the spectrum could have a significant impact on axion mini-halo formation, one of the main experimental handles on kinetic fragmentation.",

Ratajczak Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex) Some previous studies have suggested that massive and intermediate-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) could comprise a substantial fraction of dark matter in the Universe. Such black holes, if they existed in the Milky Way halo, would give rise to long-duration microlensing events that may potentially last for years. However, earlier searches were not sufficiently sensitive to detect such events. Here, we present the results of searches for long-timescale gravitational microlensing events toward the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using nearly 20 years of photometric observations collected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2001 to 2020. We found six events, three of which are new discoveries. We use a sample of five events to measure the microlensing optical depth toward the SMC $\\tau = (0.32 \\pm 0.18) \\times 10^{-7}$ and the event rate $\\Gamma = (1.18 \\pm 0.57) \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{star}^{-1}$. The properties of the detected events are consistent with lenses originating from known stellar populations within the SMC or in the Milky Way disk. No events with timescales longer than 1 yr were detected, which provides competitive limits on the fraction of massive compact objects, including PBHs, in the Milky Way dark matter halo. Together with the earlier OGLE studies of microlensing events in the direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud, these observations rule out PBHs and other compact objects with masses ranging from $10^{-8}$ to $10^3\\,M_{\\odot}$ as dominant components of dark matter.",

Comments welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Recent work has developed a formalism for computing angular power spectra directly from catalogues containing field values at discrete positions on the sky, thereby circumventing the need to create pixelised maps of the fields, as well as avoiding aliasing and finite-resolution effects. Here, we adapt this formalism to incorporate template deprojection as a means of mitigating systematic biases in the measured angular power spectra. We also introduce and validate an alternative method of mitigating the so-called `deprojection bias', caused by the loss of modes after deprojection, employing the use of simple simulations to compute a transfer function. We find that this approach performs at least as well as existing methods, and is relatively insensitive to how well one can guess the true power spectrum of the observed field, except at the largest scales ($\\ell \\lesssim 3$). Additionally, we develop exact expressions for the bias introduced by deprojection in the shot-noise component, which further improves the accuracy of this approach. We test our formalism on simulated datasets, demonstrating its applicability both to discretely sampled fields, and to the special case of galaxy clustering, with the survey selection function defined in terms of a random catalogue or as a continuous sky map. After computing and removing the bias in the shot noise and using a transfer function to correct for the remaining mode loss, our formalism is able to produce unbiased measurements of the angular power spectrum in all scenarios tested here. Finally, we apply our formalism to real data and demonstrate that it produces results consistent with the standard map-based pseudo-$C_\\ell$ formalism. We implement our method in the publicly available code NaMaster.",

Cheung, Emery Trott, Neal Dalal, Donghui Jeong 18 pages, 8 figures. Comments welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens have the potential to measure the Hubble constant $H_0$ in the local universe independently of the distance ladder, and thus offer unique new insights into the Hubble tension. A key challenge with standard sirens is detecting their electromagnetic counterparts, and therefore assigning redshifts to the measured distances. One promising way to proceed is to utilize GW `dark sirens' -- events without an identified electromagnetic counterpart -- and cross-correlate their angular distribution with that of galaxies. We present a quantitative study of how precisely the Hubble constant can be measured using tomographic cross-correlation between galaxies and GW sources. Overall, we find that the constraints on $H_0$ will be limited by the quality and quantity of GW data. We find that percent-level constraints on $H_0$ will primarily depend on achieving small distance uncertainties ($\\sigma_{d_L}=0.1\\,d_L$), obtaining a large number of GW dark sirens ($\\gtrsim$$5{,}000$), and accurate sky localization in the tomographic analysis.",

Bengaly Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) According to the perturbed Friedmann model, the difference between Hubble constant measurements in two rest frames, at leading order in velocity, is determined solely by the relative motion of the observers and remains unaffected by the peculiar velocities of the sources. This implies that, when averaging over a sufficiently large and distant set of sources where local nonlinear inhomogeneities are diminished, such a difference should vanish, so that the Hubble flow is statistically uniform, as predicted by the Cosmological Principle -- a core assumption of the standard cosmological paradigm. In previous works, distance measurement compilations, e.g. the CosmicFlows-3 catalogue, were used for this purpose, as it comprises a large number ($\\sim 10^4$) of sources of different types. Due to the increasing amount of precise luminosity distance measurements of Type Ia Supenovae (SNe) in the last few years, in this work we investigate whether we can confirm the uniformity of the Hubble flow with low-$z$ SN distances only. By means of the Pantheon+ and SH0ES compilation, we find that the results align well with previous works based on the CF3 catalogue, and are in good agreement with the expected Hubble variance in the standard model across cosmic scales of $20-150$ Mpc. Notably, the Hubble constant difference $\\Delta H_0 \\approx 0$ is observed at around $85$ Mpc. Despite the smaller sample size ($\\sim 10^2$ versus $\\sim 10^4$) relative to CF3 at those scales, our analysis show that the Pantheon+ and SH0ES dataset supports the standard model paradigm, which indicates that the Hubble flow becomes statistically uniform at around $70-100$ Mpc, which is compatible with independent determinations of the homogeneity scale based on galaxy number counts.",

We present MG-NECOLA, a convolutional neural network that enhances fast MG-PICOLA simulations to near-N-body fidelity at a fraction of the cost. MG-NECOLA reproduces QUIJOTE-MG N-body results in the power spectrum and bispectrum with better than 1% accuracy down to non-linear scales ($k \\simeq 1~h~\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), while reducing computational time by several orders of magnitude. Importantly, although trained only on $f(R)$ models with massless neutrinos, the network generalizes robustly to scenarios with massive neutrinos, preserving accuracy to within 5% at non-linear scales. This combination of precision and robustness establishes MG-NECOLA as a practical emulator for producing large ensembles of high-fidelity simulations, enabling efficient exploration of modified gravity and beyond-$\\Lambda$CDM cosmologies in upcoming surveys.",

By leveraging the angular clustering of astrophysical gravitational wave sources (AGWS) from the third-generation detectors and CSST's weak lensing surveys, we develop a theoretical framework to compute auto- and cross-angular power spectra of AGWS clustering, cosmic shear, and their cross-correlation. Mock datasets are generated by considering the detector-specific selection functions, uncertainties in luminosity distance, and weak lensing systematics. We employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to constrain the $\\Lambda \\mathrm{CDM}$ cosmological parameters, AWGS bias parameters, and star formation rate (SFR) parameters under three detector configurations. Our results demonstrate that the joint observation can achieve sub-$5\\%$ precision on $H_0$ ($2.19\\%$) and $w$ ($5.7\\%$). Besides, the AGWS clustering bias parameters can be constrained to the precision of $4\\%-5\\%$, enabling the differentiation between stellar-origin compact binaries and primordial black hole scenarios. This multi-messenger approach can also be helpful to resolve mass-redshift degeneracies in the dark siren methods, providing independent validation for the Hubble tension. Our work indicates that the joint observation of the third-generation GW detectors and the CSST can be a powerful probe of the large-scale structure and the cosmic expansion history.",

Urbaneka, Eva Sextl to be published in the Astrophysical Journal 2025, The Astrophysical Journal Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Blue supergiant distances of nearby galaxies obtained with the flux-weighted gravity-luminosity relationship are used for a measurement of the zero points of Tully-Fisher relationships at different photometric passbands. The Cousins I-band and the infrared WISE bands W1 and W2 are investigated. The results are compared with previous work using Cepheid and Tip-of-the-Red-Giant-Branch distances. No significant differences were encountered. This supports the large values of the Hubble constant greater than 73km/s/Mpc found with the Tully-Fisher distance ladder work over the last decade. Applying blue supergiant distances on the I-band Tully-Fisher relation observations yields a Hubble constant H0 = 76.2+/-6.2 km/s/Mpc. The large uncertainty is caused by the still relatively small blue supergiant galaxies sample size but will be reduced in future work.",

Submitted to A&A Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Extragalactic very high-energy (VHE; $E>100\\,$GeV) gamma rays suffer absorption in interactions with photons of the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL). The EBL is an isotropic diffuse photon field from optical to infrared wavelengths, which is difficult to measure directly due to strong foreground emission. We present niebla, the first open-source code to compute the EBL using a forward-folding approach that accepts fully customizable inputs. This software enables a detailed modelling of the influence of EBL opacities on VHE observations and facilitates the distinction between different dust reemission models. The code models the optical background primarily from stellar emission, by evolving the spectrum of a single stellar population as a function of redshift, considering mean metallicity evolution and star formation rate density. Additional sources to the EBL can be provided by the user. The code already includes optional contributions from, e.g., stripped stars, intra-halo light, or the decay of axion dark matter. The optical emissivity is then absorbed by interstellar dust and reemitted in the infrared regime. We provide multiple prescriptions to model this process, using spectral dust templates or a combination of blackbodies. We provide three EBL models calculated with different dust reemission prescriptions, which have been fitted to various observational data sets. In addition, we showcase the versatility of our model through a simulated observation of the blazar Markarian 501 in a high-flux state with the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory array. We find that the simulated VHE spectrum is highly sensitive to the EBL opacity coming from the infrared. Our model will therefore allow the community to distinguish between different dust reemission models and constrain EBL parameters with future observations.",

GRBs are ideal probes for testing the cosmological principle thanks to their high luminosity, wide redshift range, and nearly isotropic sky coverage. For the first time, we employ the luminosity-time (L-T) relation, known in the literature as the bidimensional X-ray Dainotti relation, corrected for redshift evolution, to standardize a sample of 176 long GRBs detected by \\textit{Swift}. We test for dipolar modulations in the GRB Hubble diagram using both the Dipole Fit Method and a new approach introduced here, the Anisotropic Residual Analysis Method. Both methods yield consistent results: a dipole amplitude of $A_d \\simeq 0.6 \\pm 0.2$ pointing towards (RA, DEC) $\\approx (134^\\circ \\pm 30^{\\circ}, -36^\\circ \\pm 21^{\\circ})$ (equatorial coordinates). As shown in the Appendix, this corresponds to a boost velocity of the observer with respect to the GRB rest-frame in the antipodal direction from the dipole direction. Extensive isotropy tests and 20,000 Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the detected signal cannot be explained by chance alignments or by the angular distribution of the GRB sample. We also show how, by incorporating a dipole term, residual correlations are eliminated, showing that the dipole model provides a better fit than standard isotropic $\\Lambda$CDM.",

The kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect offers a robust observational window into these properties. The pairwise kSZ estimator probes the pairwise momentum of groups of galaxies by cross-correlating cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps with spectroscopic galaxy catalogs, using galaxies to trace the positions of dark matter halos. This note introduces iskay2, an efficient pipeline designed to apply the pairwise kSZ estimator to maps of the CMB and large galaxy catalogs. Pairwise kSZ measurements obtained using this pipeline are compared to previously published results and are shown to be consistent within statistical expectations. This pipeline will enable high-precision measurements of the pairwise kSZ utilizing galaxy catalogs like DESI combined with past, current and next-generation high-resolution CMB experiments such as ACT, SPT and the Simons Observatory.",

With data from the upcoming LSST survey, we anticipate using a sample of O(1000) lensed AGN for TDC. To prepare for this dataset and enable this measurement, we construct and analyze a realistic mock sample of 1300 systems drawn from the OM10 (Oguri & Marshall 2010) catalog of simulated lenses with AGN sources at $z<3.1$ in order to test a key aspect of the analysis pipeline, that of the lens modeling. We realize the lenses as power law elliptical mass distributions and simulate 5-year LSST i-band coadd images. From every image, we infer the lens mass model parameters using neural posterior estimation (NPE). Focusing on the key model parameters, $\\theta_E$ (the Einstein Radius) and $\\gamma_{lens}$ (the projected mass density profile slope), with consistent mass-light ellipticity correlations in test and training data, we recover $\\theta_E$ with less than 1% bias per lens, 6.5% precision per lens and $\\gamma_{lens}$ with less than 3% bias per lens, 8% precision per lens. We find that lens light subtraction prior to modeling is only useful when applied to data sampled from the training prior. If emulated deconvolution is applied to the data prior to modeling, precision improves across all parameters by a factor of 2. Finally, we combine the inferred lens mass models using Bayesian Hierarchical Inference to recover the global properties of the lens sample with less than 1% bias.",

Comments are welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Current and future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments aim to achieve high-precision reconstruction of the CMB polarization signal, with the most ambitious objective being the detection of primordial $B$ modes sourced by cosmic inflation. Given the expected low amplitude of the signal, its estimate, parametrized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, is highly susceptible to contamination from Galactic foreground residuals that remain after component separation. In this work, we introduce an agnostic, model-independent procedure to construct a spectral template of residual foreground contamination in the observed angular power spectrum. Specifically, a cleaned multifrequency set of foreground-emission maps is blindly reconstructed from the observed data using the Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (GNILC) technique. These maps are then combined with the weights adopted for CMB reconstruction, yielding an estimate of the spatial distribution of foreground residuals after component separation. The power spectrum of this residual map, after proper noise debiasing, is incorporated into the spectral model of the cosmological likelihood, thereby enabling unbiased inference of cosmological parameters. We validate the method on realistic simulations of a LiteBIRD-like experiment, focusing on constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We demonstrate that including the residual template in the likelihood yields unbiased estimates of $r$, regardless of its input value, the assumed foreground model, or the adopted masking strategy, thus proving the robustness of the proposed procedure.

Vielva 30 pages, 15 figures, submitted to JCAP Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Upcoming cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments aim to detect primordial gravitational waves with unprecedented sensitivity. Effective foreground removal is essential to avoid biases in the measurement of the tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) in this high-precision regime. Recent analyses highlight the unexpected complexity of synchrotron emission at low frequencies, underscoring the need for more sensitive low-frequency data. To address this challenge, the European Low-Frequency Survey (ELFS) initiative and the Simons Array collaboration propose installing two European low-frequency receivers on one of the Simons Array telescopes. These receivers will enable measurements in the Southern Hemisphere between $6$ and $20$,GHz, complementary to those of current and proposed experiments targeting the measurement of cosmological gravitational waves. In this work, we study the benefits of combining these low-frequency observations with a representative future CMB experiment operating from the Southern Hemisphere. We find that the extra information can improve the knowledge of the underlying synchrotron spectral energy distribution (SED), with positive impacts on the robustness of measurement of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, against the complexity of low-frequency foregrounds.",

This paper implements a novel Bayesian graph deep learning framework for estimating key cosmological parameters in a primordial magnetic field (PMF) cosmology directly from simulated Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps. Our methodology utilizes DeepSphere, a spherical convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed to respect the spherical geometry of CMB data through HEALPix pixelization. To advance beyond deterministic point estimates and enable robust uncertainty quantification, we integrate Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) into the framework, capturing aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties that reflect the model confidence in its predictions. The proposed approach demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving $R^{2}$ scores exceeding 0.89 for the magnetic parameter estimation. We further obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates through post-hoc training techniques including Variance Scaling and GPNormal. This integrated DeepSphere-BNNs framework not only delivers accurate parameter estimation from CMB maps with PMF contributions but also provides reliable uncertainty quantification, providing the necessary tools for robust cosmological inference in the era of precision cosmology.",

Comments welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We develop a highly accurate analytic approximation for small-scale non-cold relic perturbations by solving the collisionless Boltzmann equation in the quasi-stationary regime. The approximation is implemented in CLASSIER (CLASS Integral Equation Revision), a modified version of the Boltzmann solver CLASS that replaces the traditional truncated Boltzmann hierarchy of non cold relic multipoles with a small set of integral equations solved iteratively. Applying it to massive neutrinos yields a factor-of-two reduction in total runtime relative to CLASSIER without the approximation. Compared to standard CLASS runs (with $\\ell_{\\rm max}^{\\rm NCDM}=40$ and no late-time massive neutrino fluid approximation) under the same precision setting, CLASSIER with this approximation is faster by a factor of 3-6. The approximation faithfully reproduces the late-time behavior of massive neutrino perturbations and preserves sub-$0.1\\%$ accuracy in the matter power spectrum today up to comoving wavenumber $k=100\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. With this approximation, massive-neutrino perturbations are no longer the computational bottleneck on small scales for linear-theory predictions.

The MFI instrument (2012-2018), installed on QT1, observed the sky at four frequency bands (11, 13, 17, and 19 GHz) with one degree angular resolution. Its successor, MFI2, began operations in 2024 and operates in the same bands. This paper has two main goals: first, to characterise the atmospheric conditions at Teide Observatory to improve existing models at these frequencies, and second, to empirically characterise atmospheric turbulence using QUIJOTE MFI and MFI2 observations. This work has implications for both atmospheric physics and CMB studies and can support future reanalyses of MFI data or the preparation of upcoming instruments such as the Tenerife Microwave Spectrometer. We used data from GPS antennas, the STELLA observatory, and radio soundings to derive median profiles and distributions of key atmospheric parameters for 2012-2018. MFI data were analysed to compute atmospheric structure functions at 17 and 19 GHz and to study the correlation properties of the atmospheric signal through cross-correlation between horns at the same frequency. MFI2 observations were used to estimate the atmospheric power spectrum and compare it with the structure function derived from MFI data. The water vapour density profile follows an exponential decay with a characteristic half-height of about 1000 m. Median PWV in 2012-2018 is 3.3 mm. For high PWV conditions, the structure function agrees with the Kolmogorov turbulence model. The slope of the power spectrum also matches the model prediction, within the frequency range limited by the outer scale and instrument noise. Finally, from the correlation function, we find that atmospheric conditions remain stable for about 1-2 hours.",

An understanding of the impact of nuisance effects such as noise on such field-level frameworks, however, still remains elusive. In this work we conduct a systematic investigation into the efficacy of DL inference from noisy Ly{\\alpha} forest spectra. Building upon our previous, proof-of-concept framework (Nayak et al. 2024) for pure spectra, we constructed and trained a ResNet neural network using labeled mock data from hydrodynamical simulations with a range of noise levels to optimally compress noisy spectra into a novel summary statistic that is exclusively sensitive to the power-law temperature-density relation of the intergalactic medium. We fit a Gaussian mixture surrogate with 23 components through our labels and summaries to estimate the joint data-parameter distribution for likelihood free inference, in addition to performing inference with a Gaussian likelihood. The posterior contours in the two cases agree well with each other. We compared the precision and accuracy of our posterior constraints with a combination of two human defined summaries (the 1D power spectrum and PDF of the Ly{\\alpha} transmission) that have been corrected for noise, over a wide range of continuum-to-noise ratios (CNR) in the likelihood case. We found a gain in precision in terms of posterior contour area with our pipeline over the said combination of 65% (at a CNR of 20 per 6 km/s) to 112% (at 200 per 6 km/s). While the improvement in posterior precision is not as large as in the noiseless case, these results indicate that DL still remains a powerful tool for inference even with noisy, real-world datasets.",

We validate the simulated population with the UVLF and $M_{\\mathrm{UV}}-M_*$ relation and see that the simulated results are consistent with observations at lower masses. We extract local gas volumetric grids of density and mass-weighted metallicity, then we use \\texttt{Cloudy} to produce synthetic emission spectra of \\species{H}{ii} regions. The mass-metallicity relation does not evolve, which is also consistent with observations. The predicted oxygen abundance exceeds observational inferences by about 0.5 dex, suggesting either overly efficient enrichment or weak feedback. However, applying the O32 diagnostic directly to our synthetic spectra shows an offset of 1 dex from the correct outputted gas-phase metallicity. This suggests that O32 is biased high at a level that is more than sufficient to account for the simulation-observation offset. The simulated galaxies' line diagnostics show mostly weaker [\\species{O}{iii}] lines and lower diagnostic values of O3 and Ne3O2 compared to observations. This suggests higher ionization parameters within the simulated galactic population in general.",

In this study, we searched for protoclusters at $z\\sim$9-10 using 366 F115W dropout galaxies. We evaluated the reliability of our photometric redshift by validation tests with the JADES DR3 spectroscopic sample, obtaining the likelihood of falsely identifying interlopers as $\\sim25\\%$. Overdensities ($\\delta$) are computed by weighting galaxy positions with their photometric redshift probability density functions (PDF), using a 2.5 cMpc aperture and a redshift slice of $\\pm$0.5. We selected the most promising core galaxies of protocluster candidate galaxies with an overdensity greater than the 95th percentile of the distribution of 366 F115W dropout galaxies. The member galaxies are then linked within an angular separation of 7.5 cMpc to the core galaxies, finding seven protocluster candidates. These seven protocluster candidates have inferred halo masses of $M_{\\text{halo}} \\sim 10^{11} M_{\\odot}$. The detection of such overdensities at these redshifts provides a critical test for current cosmological simulations.

Foo Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Strong gravitational lensing by massive galaxy clusters offers particularly rare opportunities to observe multiple images of distant ($z\\gtrsim2$) Type Ia supernovae (SNe) and resolve the properties of their host galaxies. A recent outstanding example is the Type Ia SN \"H0pe\" ($z=1.78$), discovered in James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam images when it was still triply imaged by the galaxy cluster PLCK G165.7+67.0 (G165, $z=0.35$). In this work we build a new strong lensing model of G165, first by using only the position of multiple images of background galaxies. We then increase significantly the number of constraints around the position of SN H0pe by modeling the extended surface brightness of the SN host galaxy. The average uncertainty on mass model parameters is reduced by more than an order of magnitude. We also study the spatial distribution of dust in the arc to estimate the dust extinction at the position of SN H0pe. We find good statistical agreement of the extinction estimate at $\\lesssim1\\sigma$ with three fully independent methods based on spectral energy distribution fitting. Moreover, our extended-image lens model of G165 allows us to map the dust distribution of the host galaxy from the image plane to the source plane. Supernova H0pe exploded in a region with a relatively high extinction of $A_V \\approx 0.9\\ {\\rm mag}$ at around $\\sim 1\\ {\\rm kpc}$ from its host center. This work shows that extended image modeling in lensing clusters simultaneously reduces the uncertainty on lens model parameters and enables spatially resolved analyses of lensed transients host galaxies. Such modeling advances are expected to play an important role in future cosmological analyses using strongly lensed SNe.",

The extragalactic radio background, as detected by ARCADE-2 and LWA-1, suggests a strong radio background from cosmic dawn, which can significantly alter the cosmological 21 cm signal, enhancing both the global signal amplitude and the 21 cm power spectrum. In this paper, we employ an artificial neural network (ANN) to check if there is a radio excess over the cosmic microwave background in mock data, and if present, we classify its type into one of two categories, a background from high-redshift radio galaxies or a uniform exotic background from the early Universe. Based on clean data (without observational noise), the ANN can predict the background radiation type with $96\\%$ accuracy for the power spectrum and $90\\%$ for the global signal. Although observational noise reduces the accuracy, the results remain quite useful. We also apply ANNs to map the relation between the 21 cm power spectrum and the global signal. By reconstructing the global signal using the 21 cm power spectrum, an ANN can estimate the global signal range consistent with an observed power spectrum from SKA-like experiments. Conversely, we show that an ANN can reconstruct the 21 cm power spectrum over a wide range of redshifts and wavenumbers given the global signal over the same redshifts. Such trained networks can potentially serve as a valuable tool for cross-confirmation of the 21 cm signal.",

D 112, 083538, Published 21 October, 2025 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Un-doing the effect of gravitational lensing on the Cosmic Microwave Background (`de-lensing') is essential in shaping constraints on weak signals limited by lensing effects on the CMB, for example on a background of primordial gravitational waves. Removing these anisotropies induced by large-scale structures from the CMB maps also generally helps our view of the primordial Universe by sharpening the acoustic peaks and the damping tail. However, practical implementations of delensing transfer parts of these anisotropies to the noise maps. This will induce a new large scale `mean-field' bias to any anisotropy estimator applied to the delensed CMB, and this bias directly traces large-scale structures. This paper analytically quantifies this delensed noise mean-field and its impact on quadratic (QE) and likelihood-based lensing estimators. We show that for Simons-Observatory-like surveys, this mean-field bias can reach 15\\% in cross-correlation with large-scale structures if unaccounted for. We further demonstrate that this delensed noise mean-field can be safely neglected in likelihood-based estimators without compromising the quality of lensing reconstruction or $B$-mode delensing, provided the resulting lensing map is properly renormalized.",

For a given smoothing scale, however, that information is not evenly distributed throughout the smoothed field. We investigate which parts of the field contain the most information by smoothing and splitting the field into different levels of density (using the formalism of indicator functions), deriving analytic expressions for the information content of each density bin in the joint-probability distribution (given a distance separation). When we choose one particular distance regime (i.e., cells separated by $60$-$80h^{-1}$ Mpc), we find that the information in that range peaks at moderately rare densities (where the number of smoothed survey cells is roughly of order of magnitude 100). Counter-intuitively, we find that, for a finite survey volume (again at a particular distance range), indicator function analysis can outperform conventional two-point statistics while using only a fraction of the total survey cells, and we explain why. In light of recent developments in marked statistics (such as the indicator power spectrum and density-split clustering), this result elucidates how to optimize sampling for effective extraction of cosmological information.",

This discrepancy leads to a preference for a total neutrino mass that is lower than the minimum value inferred from neutrino oscillation experiments. Alternatively, this tension can be eased within $\\Lambda$CDM by assuming a higher optical depth ($\\tau \\simeq 0.09$), but such a value conflicts with large-scale CMB polarization data. We point out that cosmic birefringence, as suggested by recent Planck reanalyses, resolves this discrepancy if the birefringence angle varies significantly during reionization. Specifically, we consider the fact that the measured cosmic birefringence angle $\\beta_0=0.34\\pm0.09\\,(1\\,\\sigma)\\,$deg has the phase ambiguity, i.e., the measured rotation angle is described by $\\beta=\\beta_0+180n\\,$deg ($n\\in \\mathbb{Z}$).

We use Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) from DESI and DES, Cosmic Microwave Background from Planck with and without lensing from Planck and ACT (noted CMBL and CMB, respectively), supernova (SN), and cross-correlations between galaxy positions and galaxy lensing from DES. First, we use pairs or trios of datasets where we exclude one type of dataset each time and categorize them as ``NO SN\", ``NO CMB\" and ``NO BAO\" combinations. In all cases, we find that the combinations favor the $w_0 w_a$CDM model over $\\Lambda$CDM, with significance ranging from 2.3$\\sigma$ to 3.3$\\sigma$. For example, DESI+DESY6BAO+CMB yields 3.2$\\sigma$ without SN, DESI+DESY6BAO+DESY5SN yields 3.3$\\sigma$ without CMB, and CMB+DESY5SN+DES3x2pts yields 2.6$\\sigma$ without BAO. The persistence of this pattern across various dataset combinations even when any of the datasets is excluded supports an overall validation of this trending result regardless of any specific dataset. Next, we use larger combinations of these datasets after verifying their mutual consistency within the $w_0 w_a$CDM model. We find combinations that give significance levels $\\sim$4$\\sigma$, with DESI+DESY6BAO+CMBL+DESY5SN reaching 4.4$\\sigma$. In sum, while we need to remain prudent, the combination of the first step that supports a validation of the pattern of these results beyond any single type of dataset and their associated systematics, together with the second step showing high-significance results when such datasets are combined, presents a compelling overall portrait in favor of a dynamical dark energy with a time-evolving equation of state over a cosmological constant, and constitutes a serious challenge to the $\\Lambda$CDM model's reign.

Host galaxy identification is essential for redshift determination but remains challenging due to poor GW sky localization and uncertainties in EMc models. To overcome these limitations, we exploit the ultra-high-precision localization ($\\Delta \\Omega_s \\sim 10^{-4} \\, \\text{deg}^2$) with a space-based GW detector network (LISA-Taiji-TianQin), which permits unique host identification solely from GW signals. We integrate five massive black hole binary (MBHB) population models and two galaxy number density models to compute the redshift horizon for host galaxy identification and evaluate $H_0$ constraints. We find that (1) The network enhances localization by several orders of magnitude compared to single detectors; (2) The identification horizon reaches $z\\sim 1.2$ for specific MBHBs in the most accurate localization case; (3) The population model choice critically impacts the outcomes: the most refined population models yield to independent EMc identification rate of 0.6-1 $\\text{yr}^{-1}$ with $H_0$ constraints $< 1\\%$ fractional uncertainty, the less refined models lead to the rate $<0.1\\text{yr}^{-1}$ and $1-2\\%$ uncertainty on $H_0$.",

However, severe challenges to the phenomenological $\\Lambda$CDM model have emerged recently, including the Hubble constant tension and the significant deviation from the $\\Lambda$CDM model reported by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration. Despite many explanations for the two challenges have been proposed, the origins of them are still intriguing mysteries. Here, we investigate the DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) measurements to interpret the Hubble constant tension. Employing a non-parametric method, we find that the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ evolves with redshift from DESI BAO data and type Ia supernovae. From the Friedmann equations, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) is derived from $w(z)$ model-independently. We find that the values of $H_0$ show a descending trend as a function of redshift, and can effectively resolve the Hubble constant tension.

A. Yung 24 pages, 16 figures, 6 tables; Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We designed customized Lyman-break color selection techniques to identify galaxy candidates in the redshift ranges $15 \\leq z \\leq 20$ and $20 \\leq z \\leq 28$. The selection was performed on the ASTRODEEP-JWST multi-band catalogs of the CEERS, Abell-2744, JADES, NGDEEP, and PRIMER survey fields, covering a total area of $\\sim0.2$ sq. deg. We identify five candidates at $15 \\leq z \\leq 20$, while no objects are found based on the $z\\gtrsim20$ color selection criteria. Despite exhibiting a $>$1.5 mag break, all the objects display multimodal redshift probability distributions across different SED-fitting codes and methodologies. The alternative solutions correspond to poorly understood populations of low-mass quiescent or dusty galaxies at z$\\sim$3-7. This conclusion is supported by the analysis of five F200W-dropout objects that we find to be interlopers on the basis of NIRSpec PRISM spectra: four dusty star-forming galaxies at z$\\sim$2.2-6.6, and a passive galaxy at z=4.91 with log$(M_{\\rm star}/{\\rm M}_{\\odot}) \\lesssim$ 9. We measured the UV luminosity function under different assumptions on the contamination level within our sample. We find that if even a fraction of the candidates is indeed at $z\\gtrsim15$, the resulting UV LF points to a very mild evolution compared to estimates at $z<15$, implying a significant tension with existing theoretical models. In particular, confirming our bright ($M_{\\text{UV}}<-21$) candidates would require substantial revisions to the theoretical framework. In turn, if all these candidates will be confirmed to be interlopers, we conclude that future surveys may need ten times wider areas to select $M_{\\text{UV}}\\lesssim-20$ galaxies at $z>15$. Observations in the F150W and F200W filters at depths comparable to those in the NIRCam LW bands are also required to mitigate contamination from rare red objects at z$\\lesssim$8.",

The Roman Observations Time Allocation Committee (ROTAC) was convened to recommend time allocations for the three Core Community Surveys (CCS) using the Wide Field Instrument (WFI): the High Latitude Wide Area Survey, the High Latitude Time Domain Survey, and the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey, as well as balance the time allocation for the General Astrophysics Surveys. Each CCS had a corresponding Definition Committee that collected community input and designed proposals for a nominal (in-guide) survey, as well as underguide and overguide options with smaller and larger time allocations, respectively. These options explored different ways of fulfilling the mission science requirements while maximizing general astrophysics science goals enabled by the surveys. In this report, the ROTAC lays out its recommendations for the three CCS observing designs and the WFI time allotment for CCS (74.5%) and the General Astrophysics Surveys (25.5%).",

      "abstract": "On the Evolution of Disk-Embedded Binaries: Framing Local Models in Global Context Philip Kirkeberg, Rixin Li, Martin E. Pessah High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The disks of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) have in recent years been recognized as possible sites for gravitational wave sources, leading to a series of numerical studies on the evolution of disk-embedded black hole binaries. The majority of these works have been carried out so far using the shearing box, a local Cartesian domain co-rotating with the binary center-of-mass around the supermassive black hole. The local nature of this framework allows for focusing computational power close to the binary at the expense of detaching the gas flow around the binary from the global dynamics. In this paper, we provide a framework to assess the applicability of the shearing box for studying the long-term evolution of the orbital elements of the embedded binary in viscous hydrodynamic disks. We accomplish this by identifying the conditions under which relevant global timescales are longer than the gas-induced evolution timescale of the embedded binary across various AGN disk models. For black hole masses of interest, we report the existence of radii beyond which the global influence of the disk may be reasonably neglected, supporting the use of the shearing box. More generally, we introduce a systematic approach to link local simulations with the global problem they aim to approximate while providing a way to gauge their accuracy. This will prove to be essential as we seek to add additional physics, such as magnetic fields and radiative transport, to develop more realistic models for black hole binary mergers and their potential electromagnetic signatures in AGN disks.",

Using 45 two-dimensional simulations for three different EoS compatible with the current tight constraints, we show that the EoS remains a major uncertainty for the outcome of core-collapse supernovae. Whereas explosions are obtained in most cases for the SFHo and SFHx EoS, for the CMF EoS, which includes a crossover from nucleonic matter to a quark phase, explosions occur only for 2 out of 15 progenitors. Less favourable conditions for neutrino-driven explosions arise for the CMF EoS due to lower neutrino luminosities and mean energies and slightly weaker contraction of the warm proto-neutron star. Our results suggest that the explodability of massive stars cannot yet be predicted based on first principles without better knowledge of the nuclear EoS. Conversely, observational constraints on stellar explodability may help further constrain the EoS.",

We present an analysis of the first XRISM/Resolve spectrum of the Seyfert-1 galaxy Mrk 279, known for its complex line profiles and variability. The data reveal velocity components within the Fe K$_{\\alpha}$ emission line that can be associated with the inner face of the molecular torus ($r \\geq 10^{4}~GM/c^{2})$, the broad line region (BLR; $r = 1650^{+5780}_{-1480}~GM/c^{2}$), and the inner accretion disk ($r = 81^{+280}_{-75}~GM/c^{2}$). We find evidence of low-velocity, highly ionized gas that contributes an H-like Fe XXVI emission line at 6.97 keV, confirming suggestions from prior low-resolution spectra. The data do not show slow winds in absorption, but two pairs of lines - consistent with He-like and H-like Fe shifted by $v\\simeq 0.22c$ and $v\\simeq 0.33c$ - improve the fit, and could represent an ultra-fast outflow (UFO). Their addition to the model only reduces the Akaike Information Criterion by 3.6 and 3.5, respectively, signaling modest support. Additional observations are needed to definitively test for the presence of fast X-ray winds in Mrk 279. We discuss these results in the context of the geometry of the central engine in AGN, emerging trends in XRISM studies of AGN, and the nature of the potential UFOs.",

The Fluorescence detector Array of Single-pixel Telescopes (FAST) is a next-generation cosmic ray experiment which utilizes ground-based fluorescence telescopes designed to detect these extremely rare particles at energies exceeding 30 EeV. FAST offers a cost-effective and low-maintenance solution to cover the huge detection areas required for UHECR observation. FAST telescopes are currently installed and remotely operated in both hemispheres, at the Pierre Auger Observatory and the Telescope Array experiment. To enable fully autonomous operation, a sophisticated trigger for data acquisition is essential. In this paper, we present two novel triggering algorithms inspired by those used at the largest observatories, but improved to meet the specific requirements imposed by the FAST design. Their performance is validated using Monte Carlo simulations of extensive air showers and UHECR events detected by the FAST telescope in the southern hemisphere. Finally, we present the sensitivity analysis estimate for FAST.",

By varying the fluctuation-to-mean magnetic-field ratio $\\delta B_0/B_0$, we examine curvature $\\kappa$ statistics and their connection to particle acceleration. The curvature probability densities display broad power-law wings, scaling linearly in $\\kappa$ below the peak and developing hard high-$\\kappa$ tails for $\\delta B_0/B_0 \\gtrsim 1$. As the mean field strengthens, the high-$\\kappa$ tails steepen, and large-curvature events are suppressed when $\\delta B_0/B_0 \\ll 1$. The probability density functions of magnetic field-line contraction, ${\\bf v}_E \\cdot {\\bf \\kappa}$, with ${\\bf v}_E$ the field-line velocity, develop power-law tails well described by a symmetric Pareto distribution, characteristic of stochastic energy exchanges, with the tails becoming harder as $\\delta B_0/B_0$ increases. Our guiding-center analysis shows that curvature-drift acceleration accounts for a substantial fraction of the energization via the motional electric field, and that it strengthens with increasing $\\delta B_0/B_0$. For well-magnetized particles, curvature-drift acceleration typically exceeds ${\\bf\\nabla}B$ drift, polarization drift, and betatron contributions. These results identify curvature-drift acceleration as a principal pathway through which magnetized turbulence transfers energy to nonthermal particles in astrophysical plasmas.",

Submitted to Astrophysical Journal. Comments welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) While the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) gravitational wave (GW) detectors have detected over 300 binary black hole (BBH) mergers to date, the first confirmation of an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to such an event remains elusive. Previous works have performed searches for counterpart candidates in transient catalogs and have identified active galactic nuclei (AGN) flares coincident with GW events; existing theory predicts that such flares may arise from the interaction of the merger remnant with the embedding accretion disk environment. We apply a statistical formalism to measure the significance of coincidence for the catalog as a whole, measuring that less than 3\\% (90\\% credible interval) of LVK BBH mergers give rise to observable AGN flares. This result still allows up to $\\sim 40\\%$ of BBH mergers to originate in AGN disks. We also examine the individual coincidences of each merger/flare pairing, determining that in all cases the flares are more likely to belong to a background population of flares not associated with GW events. Our results are consistent with theoretical predictions accounting for the observability of EM counterparts in AGN disks, as well as based on the fact that the most massive AGNs (such as those included in the search) are not expected to harbor the majority of the BBHs. We emphasize that developing both the means to distinguish BBH counterpart flares from background AGN flares and an understanding of which BBHs are most likely to produce AGN flares as counterparts is critical to optimize the use of follow-up resources.",

We calculate Rosseland Mean Opacities (RMO) within a range of temperatures and densities and analyze how they vary under different plasma conditions. In this study, we specifically focus on electron collisional and Stark ion microfield broadening effects on autoionizing resonances in photoabsorption cross sections. Our results are relevant to astrophysical models, particularly in the context of the solar opacity problem, and provide insights into discrepancies between theoretical calculations and experimental measurements. In addition, we investigate the equation-of-state (EOS) and its impact on opacities. In addition, we examine the equation-of-state (EOS) and its impact on opacities of the \"chemical picture\" Mihalas-Hummer-Dappen EOS with respect to level populations of excited levels included in the R-matrix calculations. This study should contribute to improving opacity models of HED sources such as stellar interiors adn laboratory fusion plasma experiments.",

By modeling this glitch dynamics, including vortex motion, mutual friction, and angular momentum exchange, we can probe the dense matter equation of state. We match theoretical predictions of glitch rise times, overshoot patterns, and relaxation timescales to the well-documented observations of the 2016 Vela glitch. Our model incorporates microphysical parameters such as the mutual friction coefficient $\\mathcal{B}$, which in the core arises from electron scattering off magnetized vortices, and in the crust from Kelvin wave excitation during vortex-lattice interactions. Our Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of the timing residuals reveals detailed glitch dynamics: the crustal superfluid couples on timescales of $\\sim100$ seconds, the core exhibits overshoot behavior due to strong central behavior, and the inner crust shows weak entrainment, with $\\sim70\\%$ of free neutrons remaining superfluid. The modeled rise times are consistent with the observed upper limit of 12.6 seconds, and the observed overshoot requires strong crustal friction but weak core friction, supporting a spatially varying $\\mathcal{B}$.These findings highlight the importance of microphysical modeling and demonstrate the potential of future high-cadence timing observations to further constrain the internal dynamics and composition of neutron stars.",

Despite decades of observation and modeling, the precise nature of its progenitor binary remains uncertain. To estimate the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) properties of binaries that evolve into SS\\,433-like systems, we apply simulation-based calibration to Bayesian inference and convolve a multivariate Gaussian likelihood constructed from six measured binary parameters of SS\\,433 with the isolated binary evolution model \\textsc{COSMIC}. Employing the dynamic nested sampler of \\texttt{dynesty}, we perform posterior inference over a ten-dimensional progenitor parameter space defined by the masses, orbital parameters, mass transfer possibilities, and natal kick velocity. We find that SS\\,433-like systems arise from specific regions of binary evolution parameter space depending on key assumptions, such as the mass transfer rate and uncertainty taken from observations. Our simulation-based calibration framework, implemented with a suite of machine learning algorithms and scored by a heuristic reliability metric, allows us to iteratively build posterior distributions of the progenitors of SS\\,433-like systems. This analysis reveals 90\\% confidence intervals for the ZAMS primary mass $(8, 11)$ M$_\\odot$, secondary mass $(32, 40)$ M$_\\odot $, orbital period $(136, 2259)$ days, eccentricity $(0.26, 0.6)$, common envelope evolution efficiency $(0.44, 0.76)$, accreted fraction in stable mass transfer $(0.22, 0.6)$, and black hole natal kick velocity magnitude $(5, 68)$ km/s. These results demonstrate the feasibility of direct probabilistic inference of X-ray binary progenitors to offer new insights into the evolution of high-accretion-rate systems such as SS\\,433.",

      "abstract": "Living on the edge: Testing for compact population features at the edges of parameter space Asad Hussain, Maximiliano Isi, Aaron Zimmerman Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Many astrophysical population studies involve parameters that exist on a bounded domain, such as the dimensionless spins of black holes or the eccentricities of planetary orbits, both of which are confined to $[0, 1]$. In such scenarios, we often wish to test for distributions clustered near a boundary, e.g., vanishing spin or orbital eccentricity. Conventional approaches -- whether based on Monte Carlo, kernel density estimators, or machine-learning techniques -- often suffer biases at the boundaries. These biases stem from sparse sampling near the edge, kernel-related smoothing, or artifacts introduced by domain transformations. We introduce a truncated Gaussian mixture model framework that substantially mitigates these issues, enabling accurate inference of narrow, edge-dominated population features. While our method has broad applications to many astronomical domains, we consider gravitational wave catalogs as a concrete example to demonstrate its power. In particular, we maintain agreement with published constraints on the fraction of zero-spin binary black hole systems in the GWTC-3 catalog -- results originally derived at much higher computational cost through dedicated reanalysis of individual events in the catalog. Our method can achieve similarly reliable results with a much lower computational cost. The method is publicly available in the open-source packages gravpop and truncatedgaussianmixtures.",

The secondary particles, which originate from the interaction of GCRs with the atmosphere, can be revealed by an array of ground detectors. We show that the low-threshold rate (scaler) time series recorded over 16 years of operation by the surface detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory in Malargüe (Argentina) strongly reflects solar activity and can be considered as a new proxy of solar variability. To achieve this result, we apply advanced spectral methods to this time series and to the classical solar sunspot number and sunspot area series. We detect and compare highly significant variations with periods ranging from the decadal to the daily scale and identify the origin of each variability mode. In conclusion, we show that the Auger scaler data, thanks to the very low noise level and high statistical significance related to the very high count rates ($\\sim 10^6$ counts per second), allow for a thorough and detailed investigation of the GCR flux variations in the heliosphere.",

Fryer High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Astrophysical transients can be powered by a broad range of energy sources including shock-heating (internal and external shocks), decay of radioactive isotopes, and long-lived central engines (magnetar and fallback). The dominant energy source for astrophysical transients depends on the nature of the explosive engine and its progenitor. To model all transients, light-curve codes must include all of these energy sources. Here we present a supernova light-curve code implementing analytic source models to compare the role of different energy sources in these transients. To demonstrate the utility of this code, we conduct an extensive study of type Ic broad-line supernovae. A diverse set of energy sources have been linked to Ic broad-line supernovae making them an excellent candidate for this light-curve code. In this paper, we explore which features of the explosion (mass, velocity, etc.) affect the type Ic supernovae light-curves, focusing on shock-interaction and radioactive decay energy sources. Although the explosion properties under both energy sources can be tuned to match the peak emission, matching the light-curve evolution in many Ic broad-line supernovae requires fine-tuned conditions. We find that shock interactions in the stellar wind are likely to be the dominant energy source at peak for these supernovae.",

Wieringa, Brendan O'Connor, Yacheng Kang, Rosa L. Becerra, Geoffrey Ryan, Malte Busmann 11 pages, 8 figures, comments welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Fast X-ray transients (FXRTs) are short-lived X-ray outbursts with diverse progenitor scenarios, including compact object mergers, stellar core-collapses and tidal disruption events. The Einstein Probe (EP) has enabled the rapid discovery and follow-up of dozens of FXRTs, revealing that while some of them overlap with traditional gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), a larger fraction of FXRTs have no associated gamma-ray counterpart down to deep limits. The origin of these gamma-ray dark FXRTs and their connection to the diverse landscape of stellar explosions remains an open question, which can be tackled through the study of their multi-wavelength counterparts and environment. In this paper, we present long-term radio observations of the gamma-ray dark EP241021a, which exhibits sustained radio emission for over 100 days, placing it among the longest-lived radio afterglows. We detect signature of interstellar scintillation in early epochs, allowing us to constrain the angular size and Lorentz factor of the emitting region. Our observations point to an outflow that is at least mildly relativistic with Lorentz factor > 4. Afterglow modeling favors a moderately relativistic and collimated outflow interacting with a low-density interstellar medium. The derived beaming-corrected kinetic energy and low radiative efficiency are consistent with a standard relativistic explosion which did not produce bright gamma-rays. Alternatively, a highly-relativistic structured jet remains consistent with our observations if seen substantially off-axis. In the latter case, the initial X-ray flare detected by EP would be caused by the slower ejecta from the lateral wings intercepting our line of sight rather than by traditional prompt-emission mechanisms within the jet core.",

Kovankin Journal of High Energy Astrophysics, Volume 50, February 2026, 100492 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a search for spatio-temporal clusters in 16 years of Fermi-LAT very-high-energy (VHE; $E>100$~GeV) data using the DBSCAN algorithm, focusing on high Galactic latitude ($|b|>10^{\\circ}$) clusters with $\\geq5$ events and transient doublets (two events within $\\leq 3$ days). Of 107 detected clusters, two correspond to previously unidentified VHE sources: weak BL Lacertae objects 4FGL J0039.1-2219 and 4FGL J0212.2-0219, promising targets for next-generation VHE observatories. Due to the low VHE photon background, even doublets with a duration of several days exhibited high statistical significance. While most of the 114 detected doublets originated from bright TeV emitters (e.g., Mrk 421, Mrk 501), we identified six VHE flares lacking TeVCat associations. Five of these flares correlate with sources from the Third Catalog of Fermi-LAT High-Energy Sources (3FHL), while one 'orphan' flare lacks a high-energy (HE; $E > 10$~GeV) source counterpart. Some of these flares reached extreme luminosities of $\\mathcal{O}(10^{47}~\\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}})$. No consistent temporal correlation emerged between HE and VHE activity: HE flares preceded, coincided with, or followed VHE emission across sources, with some showing no HE counterpart. Remarkably, 3FHL J0308.4+0408 (NGC 1218) is a Seyfert Type I galaxy, while no object of this class was known as a VHE emitter before. The 'orphan' flare without any known HE source in the vicinity may originate from NGC 5549, a low-luminosity LINER galaxy. Both sources expand the limited sample of non-blazar AGN detected at VHE energies. The fact that some weak sources with non-aligned jets and, sometimes, even without any traces of HE activity, could demonstrate very short and powerful VHE flares cannot be easily accounted in many current AGN models and calls for their further development.",

Electronic tables (TXT format) available at: this https URL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The association between long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) and core-collapse supernovae (SNe) has been well established since the discovery of SN 1998bw, which was linked to the low-luminosity LGRB 980425. However, long-term monitoring of several well-localized, low-redshift LGRBs has yielded compelling evidence for the absence of accompanying SNe. Notably, two long bursts, GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A, show signatures consistent with kilonova emission from compact binary mergers, indicating that at least some long events may originate from progenitors other than core-collapse SNe. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of two samples of LGRBs, i.e., LGRBs with and without SN associations, to investigate the differences that may reveal intrinsic distinctions in their progenitors. A detailed examination of their prompt emission properties, host galaxy environments, and event rates is performed. While the two samples exhibit considerable overlap in most observed properties, a significant discrepancy in their event rate is revealed. LGRBs without SN association have an event rate that aligns well with the star formation rate, whereas that of SN-associated LGRBs differs significantly. It indicates that LGRBs without an SN association may constitute a distinct subclass with intrinsically different progenitors.",

The analysis reveals significant polarisation, with polarisation degrees (PD) of ${\\sim}1.4$\\% in the NB and ${\\sim}3.7$\\% in the HB, indicating a notable decrease in polarisation when transitioning from the HB to the NB. The polarisation angles show a consistent trend across the states. Spectropolarimetric analysis favours a dependence of the polarisation on the energy. The Comptonised component shows similar polarisation in both the HB and NB and is higher than the theoretical expectation for a boundary or spreading layer. This suggests a contribution from the wind or the presence of an extended accretion disc corona (ADC) to enhance the polarisation. The results obtained here highlight the importance of using polarimetric data to better understand the accretion mechanisms and the geometry of this class of sources, providing insights into the nature of the accretion flow and the interplay between different spectral components. Overall, the findings advance our understanding of the physical processes governing accretion in low-mass X-ray binaries.",

We complement these observations with data from the \\textit{Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory} and the \\textit{Einstein Probe}, as well as radio observations from the Very Large Array. GRB 250221A is among the few short GRBs with direct afterglow spectroscopy, which gives a secure redshift determination of $z=0.768$ and allows the unambiguous identification of the host as a galaxy with a star-formation rate of $\\sim3\\,M_\\odot\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$. The X-ray and optical light curves up to $T_0+10$ ks (where $T_0$ refers to the GRB trigger time) are well described by forward-shock synchrotron emission in the slow-cooling regime within the standard fireball framework. However, at $T_0+0.6$ days, both the X-ray and optical bands exhibit an excess over the same interval, which we interpret as evidence of energy injection into a jet with a half-opening angle of $\\theta_j=11.5^{\\circ}$ through a refreshed shock powered by late central engine activity or a radially stratified ejecta. The burst properties (duration, spectral hardness, peak energy, and location in the Amati plane) all favour a compact binary merger origin. However, our modelling of the afterglow suggests a dense circumburst medium ($n\\sim80$ cm$^{-3}$), which is more typical of a Collapsar environment. This tension over the classification of this burst (short-hard vs. long-soft) as inferred from the prompt and afterglow emissions makes GRB~250221A an unusual event and underscores the limitations of duration-based classifications and the importance of multi-wavelength, time-resolved follow-up observations.",

Feedback from massive stars from their stellar winds, photoionising radiation and supernovae is postulated to expel significant amounts of gas, altering the gravitational potential energy of the star-forming region and causing a supervirial expansion, which disperses the stars into the Galaxy on rapid timescales (<10Myr). The majority of previous work has utilised N-body simulations with a background potential to model the effects of gas removal. Here, we adopt a different approach where we take the end point of hydrodynamic simulations of star formation in which stars form with and without feedback from massive stars and then evolve the stars as N-body simulations. We also scale the velocities of the stars to various virial ratios, to mimic slower or faster removal of gas, and evolve these as additional N-body simulations. We find that the simulations where the stars inherit the velocities of the sink particles from the hydrodynamic simulations predominantly evolve more like a simulation in virial equilibrium, rather than the supervirial behaviour we would expect after gas removal. We see no significant differences in the dynamical evolution between the simulations where the stars inherit velocities directly from the hydrodynamical simulations and the simulations with (sub)virial velocities. This strongly suggests that gas removal by feedback processes does not lead to rapid expansion of star-forming regions, beyond the expansion caused by dynamical relaxation in star-forming regions.",

Submitted to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Central starbursts and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are thought to be fueled by either galaxy interactions or secular processes in gravitationally unstable discs. We employ cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project to propose a new nuclear fueling scenario based on the transition that galaxies undergo from bursty to smooth star formation and from prominent global galactic winds to inefficient stellar feedback as they grow above $M_{\\star}\\sim 10^{10-10.5}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$: the last major galactic wind event shuts down star formation, evacuates gas from the galaxy, and slows down gas accretion from the circumgalactic medium (CGM), creating a $\\sim$$10^{10}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ pileup of gas in the inner CGM which later accretes coherently onto the galaxy, achieving a tenfold increase in inflow rate over pre-outflow conditions. We explicitly track the accumulation of gas along the outflow pathway owing to hydrodynamic interactions and show that $\\sim$50% of gas fueling the central $\\sim$10-100$\\,{\\rm pc}$ over the subsequent $\\sim$15$\\,{\\rm Myr}$ can be traced back to pileup gas having experienced $>$50% change in infall velocity owing to the wind interaction. This galactic wind pileup effect may thus represent a significant fueling mode for compact starbursts and luminous AGN. Galactic winds at earlier times or AGN-driven outflows can have qualitatively similar effects, but the pileup of gas driven by the last major galactic wind event refuels the galaxy precisely when the deepening stellar potential prevents further gas evacuation by stellar feedback, providing the ideal conditions for quasar fueling at the time when AGN feedback is most needed to regulate central star formation in massive galaxies at their peak of activity.",

Simpson Submitted to ApJ. 22 pages, 11 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present an analysis of high-resolution mid-infrared observations at 25 and 37 $\\mu m$ of the Sagittarius C Complex (Sgr C) in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), based on data from the SOFIA/FORCAST Galactic Center Legacy Survey. Enabled by the high bright-source limit of the FORCAST instrument, we perform a map-level dust temperature and optical depth analysis with a focus on the Sgr C HII region, which has an average dust temperature of 61 K and an average 37 $\\mu m$ optical depth of 0.05. We find that the Sgr C HII region contains several high-density dust emission ridges, with lengths of up to several parsecs. Noting prior evidence for nonthermal radio emission from these density ridges, we postulate that there is an enhancement of relativistic electrons within them, possibly attributable to diffusive shock acceleration induced by the wind of a known nearby Wolf-Rayet (WR) star impacting the density ridges and the ambient gas in the surrounding photo-dissociation region. Additionally, the tangential magnetic field in the outskirts of the Sgr C HII region may serve to confine the electrons within this region. We examined the heating effect of the WR star by calculating its heating profile and performing a spectral energy distribution modelling of the HII region. We found an integrated MIR luminosity of $(1.40\\pm0.19)\\times10^{6} L_\\odot$, which implies that presently unidentified massive stars must be present in the HII region in addition to the WR star. We also present a brief analysis of adjacent regions, such as a mid-infrared/radio source denoted \"Source C\" and the G359.43+0.02 young stellar object cluster near the northern end of the prominent Sgr C non-thermal filament (NTF).",

Hough 15 pages, 10 figures, Submitted to ApJ, Comments Welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Modern cosmological simulations have now matured to the point of reproducing the evolution of realistic galaxy populations across cosmic time. These simulations rely on feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) to quench massive galaxies, yet the details of this process remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we introduce RAFIKI (Refining AGN Feedback In Kinetic Implementations), a novel suite of simulations built upon SIMBA-C that vary the mass loading of AGN-driven winds. Unlike the fiducial SIMBA-C simulation, RAFIKI separates the efficiencies of the two kinetic feedback modes, enabling a detailed study of their impact on galaxies, black holes, and the circumgalactic medium. We explore a range of galaxy and baryon properties in the RAFIKI runs and find that even with enhanced mass loading, the lower-velocity, quasar-type mode cannot quench massive galaxies. However, it plays a significant role in regulating black hole growth and star formation in intermediate-mass galaxies. We also uncover degeneracies in the parameter space that highlight the limited current constraints on AGN feedback. RAFIKI provides a controlled framework to disentangle these degeneracies using current and upcoming observations.",

We provide a similar relation correlating the size of galaxies with the size of their dark matter haloes by leveraging the small scatter of the aforementioned relation. We analysed the simulated galaxies of the two main cosmological volumes of the EAGLE simulations, and computed the size of galaxies and their mass mimicking the observational analysis. For central galaxies, we computed the relation between galaxy size and halo size. We show that the simulated galaxies reproduce the observed stellar mass-size relation's normalisation and slope. The scatter of this relation, 0.06 dex, matches the intrinsic scatter measured in observation. We then computed the correlation between galaxy size and halo size, and found that the relation is steeper than when using the half-mass radius as measure of size, with the scatter (0.1 dex) a factor of two smaller than the observed relation. As well, the galaxy-to-halo mass relation derived from simulations provides a factor of two better scatter than observed. This opens the possibility of measuring the size of dark matter haloes with great accuracy (less than fifty percent, i.e. around six times better than using the effective radius) by using only deep imaging data.",

By contrast, while tidal interactions are known for having an influence, their contribution remains comparatively under explored. The LMC, the nearest disc galaxy to the Milky Way (MW) and currently interacting with the SMC, provides a unique laboratory to investigate this interplay. We aim to quantify the impact of tidal interactions on radial migration and metallicity distribution in high-resolution simulations of LMC-like disc galaxies. We leverage a subsample of KRATOS, a suite of 28 pure $N$-body simulations of the LMC-SMC-MW system. Specifically, we use 6 simulations of both isolated and interacting LMC-like galaxies, exploring different values of the Toomre stellar parameter $Q$. These simulations allow to map the evolution of the stars' guiding radii $R_g(t)$ and compute radial migration fluxes in interacting systems and compare with their isolated counterparts, allowing to quantify the link between tidal interactions, radial migration, non-axisymmetric patterns, disc internal stability, and radial metallicity distribution. We present tidally-triggered wave-like radial migration fluxes reaching up to $\\sim40\\%$ of disc stellar mass per Gyr. This wave-like migration appears during the satellite's pericentre passages, almost independently of $Q$ and induces a metallicity drop of $\\sim$3-5\\% of the isolated galaxy's maximum metallicity in the inner disc. Additionally, in the isolated simulations, the extent of variation in the bar's resonance region coincides with the mixing zones in the metallicity distribution. We propose a novel description of a wave-like radial migration flux as a dynamical response of a galaxy undergoing tidal interactions and sketch its impact on the galaxy's metallicity distribution.",

Galaxy clusters and their surroundings provide ideal laboratories to study these effects, particularly mechanisms such as quenching and morphological transformation. The Chilean Cluster galaxy Evolution Survey (CHANCES) Low-z sub-survey is part of the CHileAN Cluster galaxy Evolution Survey, a 4MOST community survey designed to uncover the relationship between the formation and evolution of galaxies and hierarchical structure formation as it happens, through deep and wide multi-object spectroscopy. We present the target selection strategy followed to select galaxy cluster candidate members for the CHANCES low-z sub-survey, in and around 50 clusters and two superclusters at z<0.07, out to (5XR200) and down to mr= 20.4. Combining public photometric redshift estimates from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey and T80S/S-PLUS iDR5, with custom photometric redshifts, we identify likely galaxy cluster candidate members whose photometric redshifts are consistent with being at the known redshift of the cluster and measure the average deviations of their photometric redshifts with respect to the spectroscopic redshift measurements {\\sigma}NMAD. We have successfully compiled our CHANCES-low-redshift catalogues, split into three different sub-surveys: low-z bright (mr<18.5), low-z faint (18.5<=mr<20.4) and low-z faint supplementary, by selecting>= 500,000 galaxy cluster candidate members and including confirmed spectroscopic galaxy cluster members, from which we expect to obtain 4MOST low-resolution (R~6500) spectra for ~320,000 galaxies. The CHANCES Low-z target catalogues form a statistically robust sample for spectroscopic follow-up, allowing studies of galaxy evolution and environmental effects in nearby cluster and supercluster environments.",

Main result: Fig. 6 (direct-Te MZR) and 9 (Impact of selection effects). Resubmitted to A&A after first round of referee comments Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We aim to characterise the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and the 3D correlation between stellar mass, metallicity and star-formation rate (SFR) known as the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) for galaxies at $5<z<7$. Using $\\sim800$ [O III] selected galaxies from deep NIRCam grism surveys, we present our stacked measurements of direct-$T\\rm_e$ metallicities, which we use to test recent strong-line metallicity calibrations. Our measured direct-$T\\rm_e$ metallicities ($0.1$-$0.2\\,\\rm Z_\\odot$ for M$_\\star$ $\\approx5\\times10^{7-9}$ M$_{\\odot}$, respectively) match recent JWST/NIRSpec-based results. However, there are significant inconsistencies between observations and hydrodynamical simulations. We observe a flatter MZR slope than the SPHINX$^{20}$ and FLARES simulations, which cannot be attributed to selection effects. With simple models, we show that the effect of an [O III] flux-limited sample on the observed shape of the MZR is strongly dependent on the FMR. If the FMR is similar to the one in the local Universe, the intrinsic high-redshift MZR should be even flatter than observed. In turn, a 3D relation where SFR correlates positively with metallicity at fixed mass would imply an intrinsically steeper MZR. Our measurements indicate that metallicity variations at fixed mass show little dependence on the SFR, suggesting a flat intrinsic MZR. This could indicate that the low-mass galaxies at these redshifts are out of equilibrium and that metal enrichment occurs rapidly in low-mass galaxies. However, being limited by our stacking analysis, we are yet to probe the scatter in the MZR and its dependence on SFR. Large carefully selected samples of galaxies with robust metallicity measurements can put tight constraints on the high-redshift FMR and, help to understand the interplay between gas flows, star formation and feedback in early galaxies.",

Sven Buder, Tobias Buck, Ása Skúladóttir, Melissa Ness, Madeleine McKenzie, Stephanie Monty 9 pages, 7 figures, submitted to MNRAS, comments welcome, Paper I can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11284. GitHub Repository at this http URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) One of the most debated consequences of the Milky Way's last major merger is the so-called $Splash$: stars with disc-like chemistry but halo-like kinematics, often interpreted as evidence for the violent heating of an early protodisc. Using the same high-resolution NIHAO-UHD cosmological simulation analysed in Buder et al. (2025b, hereafter Paper I), we test whether, and if so how, a Splash-like population arises in the Milky Way analogue. By tracing stellar birth positions, ages, and present-day orbits, we find that protodisc stars were already born on dynamically hot orbits, with no evidence for significant additional dynamical $splashing$ of these particular in-situ stars despite a 1:5 stellar mass merger. The observed Splash may therefore reflect the already turbulent early disc, subsequently intermixed with accreted stars and those formed from merger-driven gas inflows, rather than a distinct merger-heated population. When selecting stars with similar chemistry and age as the Splash-like ones, we find their azimuthal velocity distribution to be broad and positively skewed, with $V_\\varphi = 73_{-59}^{+74}\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$. The transition to a rotation-supported disc with large azimuthal velocities occurs only during or after the merger. Our results suggest an alternative to the proposed splashing scenario and highlight the need to disentangle the relative contributions of merger-induced heating and intrinsically hot disc formation to clarify the nature of Splash-like stars and their role in shaping the early Milky Way.",

Blakeslee, Joseph B. Jensen, Marco Mirabile, Enzo Brocato, Massimo Brescia, Claudia M. Raiteri Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The Surface Brightness Fluctuation method is one of the most reliable and efficient ways of measuring distances to galaxies within 100 Mpc. While recent implementations have increasingly relied on space-based observations, SBF remains effective when applied to ground-based data. In particular, deep, wide-field imaging surveys with sub-arcsecond seeing conditions allows us for accurate SBF measurements across large samples of galaxies. With the upcoming next generation wide-area imaging surveys, the thousands of galaxies suitable for SBF measurements will give us the opportunity to constrain the 3D structure of the local universe. We present FAST-SBF, a new Python-based pipeline for measuring SBF, developed to support the analysis of large datasets from upcoming wide-field imaging surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and Roman. The procedure, still in the testing and development stage, is designed for automation and minimal user intervention, offering a fast and flexible approach to SBF distance estimation. We validate the performance of the procedure on high-quality imaging data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP), a precursor to LSST, analyzing a sample of both luminous early-type galaxies and fainter dwarfs. Our measurements are also compared with recent results from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS) and with the SPoT stellar population synthesis models. The results show excellent agreement with published distances, with the capability of measuring the SBF signal also for faint dwarf galaxies. The pipeline allows the user to completely analyze a galaxy in relatively short time ($\\approx$ minutes) and significantly reduces the need for user intervention. reduces at minimum the user intervention. The FAST-SBF tool is planned for public release to support the community in using SBF as a distance indicator in next-generation surveys.",

Paper presented at the IAU Symposium 398 & MODEST-25 : Compact Objects and Binaries in Dense Stellar Systems Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The hierarchical nature of galaxy formation in the {\\Lambda}CDM framework often leads to multiple supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the galactic nuclei. The timescale over which galaxies merge, plays a crucial role in shaping the dynamical evolution and the merger dynamics of their central SMBHs. While binary SMBH evolution is well studied, the long-term dynamics of triple SMBH systems, particularly in non-spherical potentials, remain less understood. We investigate the role of triaxiality in the evolution and dynamics of triple SMBHs with initial conditions drawn from the ROMULUS25 cosmological simulation, using high-resolution gravitodynamical N-body simulations. We explore different orbital configurations and host shapes, tracking the evolution from galactic inspiral to hard binary formation at sub-parsec scales. In all cases, the two most massive SMBHs form a rapidly hardening binary that coalesces within a fraction of a Hubble time, while the third forms a stable hierarchical triple system with the heavier binary, or remains on a wide orbit.",

Carlberg (University of Toronto) 10 pages, 8 figs, to appear in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The well-known bar instability of rotationally-supported disk galaxy models has been studied extensively since its first discovery over half a century ago. We were therefore very surprised to find cases of disks embedded in rigid halos, which on the basis of widely-cited criteria should be unstable, that appeared to be robustly stable. Here we show that the unstable bar mode in such simulations was being suppressed by changes to the disk caused by other instabilities having higher angular symmetry that were the first to saturate. Although this may seem like a promising solution to the long-standing puzzle presented by the apparent stability of real disk galaxies, we also show that instability is restored in the same models when the rigid halo is replaced by a live population of particles, where the usual stability conditions apply. Our study has been confined to a narrow range of models, and we cannot therefore exclude the possibility that mode interference may be able to prevent bar formation in other models having live halos.",

Suelves 18 pages, 14 figures, 2 tables, accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Galaxy mergers can change the rate at which stars are formed. We can trace when these changes occur in simulations of galaxy mergers. However, for observed galaxies we do not know how the star-formation rate (SFR) evolves along the merger sequence as it is difficult to probe the time before or after coalescence. We aim to derive how SFR changes in observed mergers throughout the merger sequence, from a statistical perspective. Merger times were estimated for observed galaxy mergers in the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN was trained on mock KiDS images created using IllustrisTNG data. The SFRs were derived from spectral energy density fitting to KiDS and VIKINGs data. To determine the change in SFR for the merging galaxies, each merging galaxy was matched and compared to ten comparable non-merging galaxies; matching redshift, stellar mass, and local density. Mergers see an increase in SFR for galaxies from 300~Myr before the merger until coalescence, continuing until at least 200~Myr after the merger event. After this, there is a possibility that SFR activity in the mergers begins to decrease, but we need more data to better constrain our merger times and SFRs to confirm this. We find that more galaxies with larger stellar mass (M$_{\\star}$) have greater SFR enhancement as they merge compared to lower M$_{\\star}$ galaxies. There is no clear trend of changing SFR enhancement as local density changes, but the least dense environments have the least SFR enhancement. The increasing SFR enhancement is likely due to closer proximity of galaxies and the presence of more close passes as the time before merger approaches 0~Myr, with SFR slowing 200~Myr after the merger event.",

Matthews, George Blaney 13 pages, 6 figures. Comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are known to correlate with many properties of their host galaxies, but we do not fully understand these correlations. The strengths (tightness) of these correlations have also been widely debated. In this work, we explore SMBH-host relations in three state-of-the-art cosmological simulations: Illustris, TNG, and EAGLE. Using a variety of machine learning regressors, we measure the scaling relations between black hole mass ($M_{\\rm BH}$) and galaxy properties including stellar velocity dispersion ($\\sigma$), stellar mass ($M_{\\star}$), dark matter halo mass ($M_{\\rm Halo}$), and the Sersic index. We find that machine learning regressors provide predictive capabilities superior to linear regression in many scaling relations in simulations, and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) regressor has the strongest performance. SMBH-host relations have different strengths in different simulations as a result of their sub-grid models. Similar to the observations, the $M_{\\rm BH} $-$\\sigma$ relation is a strong correlation in all simulations, but in TNG, the $M_{\\rm BH} $-$M_{\\star}$ relation is even tighter than $M_{\\rm BH} $-$\\sigma$. EAGLE produces the weakest SMBH-host correlations among all simulations. Low mass SMBHs tend to be poorly correlated with their host galaxies, but including them can still help machines better grasp the correlations in Illustris and TNG. Combining galaxy properties that strongly correlate with $M_{\\rm BH} $ but poorly correlate with each other can improve MLP's performance. $M_{\\rm BH} $ is most accurately predicted when all galaxy properties are included in the training, suggesting that SMBH-host correlations are fundamentally multi-dimensional in these simulations.",

Our method consists in obtaining a generic SED for a large sample of Seyfert 1 (Sy1; part 1), then applying this SED to Seyfert 2 (Sy2; Part~II), expecting that the only difference will be the line-of-sight (LOS) angle, $i$, relative to the polar axis of the torus of gas and dust obscuring the broad line regions (BLRs). Our sample is composed of 3,896 Type 1, Sy1 at low redshifts, $ z<0.4$, separated into four spectral subgroups depending on the presence or absence in their spectra of narrow emission lines, Sy1N/Sy1B, and AGN wind, Sy1Bw and Sy1Nw. The generic SED produced by X-CIGALE applies to 90\\% of the Sy1 in our sample. It includes a clumpy torus with an AGN engine seen face-on ($i \\sim 10^\\circ \\pm 5^\\circ$). Our analysis not only supports the existence of a torus in Sy1, in good agreement with UPAGN, but also reveals new facts about the accretion of matter and AGN wind: 1- a sudden accretion of matter from the BLR to the accretion disk triggered the wind, 2- matter from the wind replenishes the torus, consistent with a gradual formation of this structure by recurrent AGN winds, and 3- Sy1Bw and Sy1Nw eventually evolve as AGN without wind, leaving behind a torus as evidence of a higher AGN activity in their past.",

Stellar clusters, with low velocity dispersions and high number densities, can be the source of strong and frequent flybys. As a result, we can infer what properties of the solar birth environment would be incompatible with the structure of the outer solar system observed today.

Our JWST/NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy targeting three galaxies at $z=6-7$ detects key rest-frame optical emission lines, allowing us to derive [OII]$\\lambda\\lambda$3726,3729-based electron densities of $n_\\mathrm{e,optical}\\sim1000$ cm$^{-3}$ on average and [OIII]$\\lambda$4363-based metallicities of $\\mathrm{12+log(O/H)}=8.0-8.2$ in two galaxies. New ALMA Band 9/10 observations detect the [OIII]52$\\mu$m line in one galaxy but do not in the others, resulting in FIR-based densities of $n_\\mathrm{e,FIR}\\lesssim500$ cm$^{-3}$ from the [OIII]52$\\mu$m/[OIII]88$\\mu$m ratios, systematically lower than the optical [OII]-based measurements. These low FIR-based densities are comparable to those at both $z\\sim0$ and $z>6$ in the literature, including JADES-GS-z14-0 at $z=14.18$, suggesting little evolution up to $z\\sim14$, in contrast to the increasing trend of optical-based densities with redshift. By conducting a JWST and ALMA joint analysis using emission lines detected with both telescopes, we find that the observed FIR [OIII]52,88$\\mu$m luminosities are too high to be explained by the optical-based densities at which they would be significantly collisionally de-excited. Instead, a 2-zone model with distinct high- and low-density regions is required to reproduce all observed lines, indicating that FIR [OIII] emission arises predominantly from low-density gas, while optical [OIII] and [OII] lines trace both regions. We further demonstrate that the direct-$T_\\mathrm{e}$ method can sometimes significantly underestimate metallicities up to 0.8 dex due to the presence of the low-density gas not fully traced by optical lines alone, highlighting the importance of combining optical and FIR lines to accurately determine gas-phase metallicities in the early universe.",

These outflows are often modelled theoretically using wind tunnel simulations of a cold ($\\sim 10^4$ K) cloud interacting with a uniform hot ($\\sim 10^6$ K) wind. However, real outflows expand downstream, a feature overlooked in most idealised simulations. We study how an expanding wind affects the survival, morphology, and dynamics of a cloud. We conduct idealised hydrodynamic simulations with optically thin radiative cooling of a cloud in an expanding wind, modelled using the adiabatic Chevalier & Clegg (1985) solution. We find that clouds remain locally isobaric with the wind, leading to a steep decline in their density contrast and eventual dissolution downstream. Compared to a plane-parallel wind, this suppresses cold gas mass growth because as clouds travel downstream, the surrounding mixed boundary layer becomes diffuse and less radiative. Our analytical scaling arguments show that cloud expansion and local pressure equilibrium are the key regulators of cold mass growth. Unlike traditional simulations, our model accounts for the differential expansion experienced by the long cometary tails of clouds in wind tunnels. This creates a strong head-to-tail emission gradient in the filamentary cold gas, which is more consistent with observations. We also demonstrate that the dynamics of individual clouds can substantially alter the radial properties of their host multiphase outflows.",

Observations of the long-wavelength dust continuum, a proxy for the cold gas, are widely used in the high-redshift community because of their ease and efficiency. These measurements rely on the assumption of a molecular gas-to-dust mass ratio, typically taken to be GDR ~ 100 in massive, metal-rich systems. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the 870um dust continuum in a sample of five massive quiescent galaxies at z ~ 1 with existing detections of CO(2-1). We find surprisingly weak dust emission, falling a factor of >~0.4-0.8 dex below the typical correlation between CO and continuum luminosity. We interpret this dust deficiency as evidence for unusually high GDR in these galaxies, which we calculate to range from 300 to at least 1200. Our results and other observations from the literature are generally compatible with predictions from the SIMBA cosmological simulation that dust is preferentially destroyed in quiescent galaxies. Ultimately, we conclude that the dust continuum is a highly unreliable tracer of the molecular gas in high-redshift quiescent galaxies. As a consequence we may know much less about the cold gas contents of this population than previously thought.",

Accepted for publication to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The polar mid-infrared (MIR) emission detected within 10-100s pcs in some active galactic nuclei (AGN) has been associated with dusty winds driven away by radiation pressure. The physical characterization of this extended polar emission remains uncertain. Here we combine 10-21 $\\mu$m JWST/MIRI imaging observations with 7-25 $\\mu$m JWST/MRS integral field spectroscopic observations of 6 nearby, $\\bar{D}=35.4\\pm4.6$ Mpc, AGN from the GATOS Survey to quantify the nature of the extended MIR emission at ~75 pc resolution at 21 $\\mu$m. These AGN have similar bolometric luminosities, $\\log_{10}(\\bar{L}_{bol}\\,[erg\\,s^{-1}])=44.0\\pm0.3$, span a wide range of optical outflow rates, $\\dot{M}=0.003-0.21$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, column densities, $\\log_{10}(N_{H}^{X-ray}[cm^{-2}])=22.2-24.3$, and Eddington ratios, $\\lambda_{Edd}=0.005-0.06$. We cross-correlate the line-only and continuum-only images and find a poor correlation, which indicates that the extended MIR continuum emission is spatially uncorrelated with the warm outflows associated with narrow emission lines within 10-15 $\\mu$m. Line emission is resolved along the jet axis, while dust emission is perpendicular to it. The 75-450 pc continuum emission has a fairly constant dust temperature, $T_{d}=132^{+7}_{-7}$ K, and mass, $M_{d}=728^{+29}_{-27}$ M$_{\\odot}$. Using the conditions of energy balance between radiation-pressure and gravity ($\\lambda_{Edd}$ vs. N$_{H}$), we find that our AGN sample is in the gravitationally bounded regime consistent with no detection of dusty winds. At 10 $\\mu$m, the level of extended line emission contribution is correlated with the outflow kinetic energy and mass outflow rates. We find no correlation with the AGN properties. These results indicate that the radio jet may be triggering the gas outflow and line emission, while the extended dust emission is distributed in molecular clouds and/or shocked regions.",

Bryan 16 pages, 14 figures; A&A in press; abstract slightly abridged; comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Major mergers of galaxies are likely to trigger bursty star formation activities. The accumulation of dense gas and the boost of star formation efficiency (SFE) are considered to be the two main drivers of starbursts. However, it remains unclear how each process operates on the scale of individual star-forming clouds. Here, we present a high-resolution (2 Msun) RHD simulation of a gas-rich dwarf galaxy merger using the RIGEL model to investigate how mergers affect the properties of the structure of dense star-forming gas and the cloud-scale SFE. We tracked the evolution of sub-virial dense clouds in the simulation by mapping them across successive snapshots taken at intervals of 0.2 Myr. We find that the merger triggers a 130 fold increase in the SFR and shortens the galaxy-wide gas-depletion time by two orders of magnitude compared to those in two isolated galaxies. However, the depletion time of individual clouds and their lifetime distribution remained unchanged over the simulation period. The cloud life cycles and cloud-scale SFE are determined by the local stellar feedback rather than such environmental factors as tidal fields regardless of the merger process, and the integrated SFE ($\\epsilon_{\\rm int}$) of clouds in complex environments remains well-described by an $\\epsilon_{\\rm int}-\\Sigma_{\\rm tot}$ relation found in idealized isolated-cloud experiments. During the peak of the starburst, the media SFE was lower by only 0.17-0.33 dex compared to the value when the galaxies were not interacting. The merger boosts the SFR through the accumulation and compression of dense gas fueling star formation. Strong tidal torques assemble $>10^5$ Msun clouds, which seed massive star clusters. The average separation between star-forming clouds decreases during the merger, which in turn decreases the cloud--cluster spatial de-correlation from >1 kpc to 0.1 kpc depicted in tuning fork diagrams.",

Code of this work can be found at this https URL Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) RR Lyrae stars have long been considered reliable tracers of old, metal-poor populations, primarily due to their prevalence in globular clusters and the Galactic halo. However, the discovery of a metal-rich subpopulation in the Galactic disc, kinematically colder and more rotationally supported, challenges this classical view. Understanding the age of these metal-rich RR Lyrae stars is crucial for constraining their formation pathways and assessing what Galactic populations they are tracing. In this work, we leverage the unprecedented astrometric precision of Gaia DR3 to infer the age distribution of metal-rich RR Lyrae stars through a kinematic comparison with O-rich Mira variables. Mira variables, with their well-established period-age relation, serve as a natural clock, allowing us to transfer age information to RR Lyrae stars via their phase-space properties. By applying this approach across different metallicity bins, we find that the most metal-rich RR Lyrae stars ($[\\rm Fe/H] > -0.5$) exhibit kinematics consistent with long-period ($\\rm{period}\\approx 150\\,\\rm{days}$), young Mira variable population; its age corresponds to $\\sim 6-7$ Gyr (adopting the period-age relation in Zhang & Sanders 2023) that is significantly younger than typically assumed for RR Lyrae stars. In contrast, those with $-1 < [\\rm Fe/H] < -0.5$ show properties more aligned with older ($\\approx 9-11$ Gyr) populations. Interestingly we also find evidence of a possible double age populations for the most metal-rich RR Lyrae, one younger with ages between 4 and 6 Gyr, and another one older ranging from 8 to 9 Gyr. These results provide strong evidence that metal-rich RR Lyrae stars in the Galactic field do not exclusively trace ancient populations. This finding challenges the current model of RR Lyrae formation and supports alternative formation scenarios, such as binary evolution.",

      "abstract": "A comprehensive grid of massive binary evolution models for the Galaxy - Surface properties of post-mass transfer stars Harim Jin, Norbert Langer, Andrea Ercolino, Selma E. de Mink Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Massive stars often evolve in binary systems, in which binary interactions significantly affect their evolution. Massive stars in the Galaxy serve as valuable testbeds for this due to their proximity. We computed the evolution of more than 38000 galactic binary systems with initial primary star masses of 5...100 Msun. In this paper, we aim to investigate the surface properties of post-mass transfer mass donor and mass gainer stars through core hydrogen burning, core helium burning, and for the pre-supernova stage. The models are computed with MESA, incorporating detailed stellar and binary physics, including internal differential rotation, magnetic angular momentum transport, mass-dependent overshooting, stellar wind mass-loss, mass and angular momentum transfer and tidal interaction. They incorporate a new extensive nuclear network for hydrogen burning, which allows us to track the full range of hydrogen burning nucleosynthesis products, from the light elements to aluminum. The widest, non-interacting binary models in our grid effectively serve as single star models. We find that mass gainers and mass donors may evolve through long-lived blue and yellow supergiant stages during core helium burning where single stars of the same mass remain red supergiants. Furthermore, some of our gainers evolve into more luminous yellow and blue supergiants prior to core collapse than single stars, while some donors end their life as red or yellow supergiants, showing a rich diversity in supernova progenitors. We show that the surface elemental and isotopic abundances carry valuable information about a star's evolutionary history and can be used to distinguish binary interaction products from single stars. Our binary model grid may serve as a tool for identifying post-mass transfer stars and supernovae, and holds potential for population studies, supernova modeling, and guidance of future observations.",

Nóbrega-Siverio Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal. Contains 5 animations, provided as ancillary files Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present a radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulation of a magnetic cancellation event. The model is calculated with the Bifrost code and spans from the uppermost convection zone to the corona. The cancellation occurs between the positive polarity of an emerged magnetic bipole and a preexisting negative polarity. We try both to understand the RMHD aspects as well as to carry out comparison to observations, in part via spectral synthesis of optically thick photospheric and chromospheric lines using the RH1.5D code, and optically thin coronal ones. The reconnection between the opposite flux systems takes place at chromospheric heights through a quasi-separatrix layer without null points. Sharp V-shaped upward-moving field lines and highly warped downward-moving post-reconnection loops are created. The chromospheric reconnection is in full swing when the colliding magnetic patches are still separated by a granular cell at the photosphere. In a later phase, photospheric cancellation takes place with submergence of the closed magnetic loops linking the opposite polarities. We carry out comparisons with the observations of the photospheric magnetic flux loss rates, as well as of the horizontal magnetic field and vertical velocity at the polarity inversion line. The reconnection outflows cause intensity brightenings, jets and different spectral features in the synthesized chromospheric spectral lines, strongly reminiscent of those found in recent observations. Coherent, twisted magnetic flux ropes are created by the flows associated with the process. Including coronal levels is crucial for proper modeling, even if no major ejection or brightening is produced in the corona in this event.",

Open clusters provide a unique opportunity to study $\\delta$ Scuti pulsations among coeval populations with uniform chemical composition. Here we use data from the TESS Mission to discover 79 $\\delta$ Scuti pulsators in the 300 Myr old open cluster NGC 3532, the largest number found within a single open cluster to-date. We report a $50\\pm5\\%$ pulsator fraction in NGC 3532, considerably lower than in younger stellar populations, such the Pleiades (110 Myr), NGC 2516 (100 Myr), and the Cep-Her Complex ($\\leq\\,$80 Myr), and similar to the pulsator fraction found among field star samples. We introduce the concept of pulsator occurrence, which corrects for incompleteness, and find it to be $63\\pm6\\%$. For the stars that do pulsate, we find that the hotter stars occupy a distinct branch in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) due to faster rotation ($>\\,$150 km/s) than their non-pulsating counterparts. These results suggest that pulsator occurrence decreases with age and that rapid rotation is important in maintaining $\\delta$ Scuti pulsations over time. We also investigate the Period-Luminosity (P-L) relation and the $\\nu_{\\rm max}$--$T_{\\rm eff}$ relation of $\\delta$ Scuti stars in NGC 3532.

We consider stars with masses in the range of $0.09 - 0.75 M_\\odot$ and planets with a surface dipolar magnetic field of 0.5 G. We estimate the size of the magnetospheres of such exoplanets using the pressure balance equation including the contribution of magnetic and ram pressures from stellar winds. We explore different scenarios, including fast and slow stellar winds, to assess the relevance of kinetic contribution. Furthermore, the effect of tidal locking and potential deviations from the Parker spiral, typically used to describe the interplanetary magnetic field, are analyzed. We show that for low mass stars ($M < 0.15 M_\\odot$), the ram pressure exerted by stellar winds affects the size of the magnetosphere more than the stellar wind magnetic pressure. Interestingly, when the ram pressure is not much stronger than the magnetic pressure, typically for higher mass stars, the inclusion of ram pressure can be beneficial to the magnetosphere due to the magnetopause currents. A magnetosphere with the size of that of modern Earth is difficult to achieve with the current assumptions. However, an early Earth magnetosphere is achieved by roughly half of our hypothetical planets orbiting the outer radius of the HZ in most of the considered cases. We find that deviations from the Parker spiral can affect the results significantly, reducing the magnetosphere by $56\\%$ in extreme cases. Most of the hypothetical planets are most likely (or might be) tidally locked, with the notable exception of those orbiting the outer HZ of GJ 846 and V1005 Ori.",

While the non-LTE effect tends to strengthen lines in G stars, it acts in the direction of line weakening in the regime of A stars due to increasing imortance of overionization. The Ba abundances of G stars turned out almost constant (<A>= 2.33), indicating that the primordial composition of Ba in Hyades is mildly supersolar by ~+0.2dex. In contrast, A-type stars show Ba overabundances of considerably large dispersion (0~<[Ba/H]~<2). Since this Ba excess tends to increase with an increase/decrease in Teff/vsini, these two parameters may be essential for producing or controling the anomaly. Regarding Hyades F-type stars, their Ba abundances are not uniform but show a broad depression (by <~0.3dex) around Teff~6500K, interestingly coinciding with the location of Li-dip.",

As a recently discovered class of radial-mode pulsators, the origin and nature of these variables remain the subject of ongoing investigations. Here, we present a comprehensive summary of all BLAPs identified in the data of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE), including the discovery of 88 new BLAPs in the inner Galactic bulge fields. We performed a systematic search for periodic signals in the $I$-band light curves of more than 400 milion stars with magnitudes down to $I = 21$. Our search effectively doubles the number of these variables to almost 200. The detected BLAPs exhibit pulsation periods between roughly 5 and 76 minutes. The analyzed dataset covers a timespan from 2001 to 2024, with some stars observed up to 20,000 times, providing the temporal coverage needed to study period and amplitude variations. We report on three objects that show enormous period changes, at a rate of $10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$, which could provide important clues to the evolutionary status of BLAPs. Full dataset is incorporated into the publicly available OGLE Collection of Variable Stars (OCVS), enabling future studies of these enigmatic objects.",

The mid-infrared JWST spectrum of T Cha shows multiple prominent aromatic infrared bands (AIBs) around 6.2, 8.1, and 11.3 $\\mu$m. AIBs are commonly accepted as the emission stemming from PAH molecules. We aim to characterize the PAHs giving rise to the AIBs observed in the JWST spectrum of T Cha. Our objective is to estimate the PAH abundances, in terms of their sizes, ionization fraction, and mass, in the disk of T Cha. We perform spectral fitting of the observed AIBs to identify the possible underlying PAH emission components. We transfer the stellar radiation through a parametric disk model in order to reproduce the mid-IR spectrum, optical photometric fluxes, and mm continuum band fluxes of T Cha. We include PAH dust grains, which are stochastically heated, in our model calculations to simulate the AIBs. Thus, we estimate the PAH abundances from our modelling. We use the results from previous observations and modelling efforts to reduce our model degeneracies. The overall disk morphology - an inner and an outer disk separated by a dust gap - derived in this work is consistent with the previous results from Spitzer, VLT, and ALMA observations. PAHs are located within the outer disk in our model. Given our best fiducial model, we estimate a population of small PAHs of <26 C atoms, with an ionized PAH fraction of $\\sim0.15$. We also obtain a PAH-to-dust mass ratio of ~7$\\times$10$^{-3}$, which amounts to ~17% of the PAH-to-dust mass ratio observed in the ISM. We predict the outer disk to have a frontal wall with smaller dust grains, sizes limited up to $\\mu$m-order, in order to properly fit the continuum slope within 14-25 $\\mu$m. We propose a possibility of sub-micron dust grains within the gap to justify an observed plateau around ~10 $\\mu$m in the JWST spectrum.",

Here we investigate the growth of a BH embedded at the center of a quasi-star, a theoretically predicted object formed via direct collapse. In a quasi-star, the central BH accretes at a highly super-Eddington rate, while the excess energy is transported outward by convection and radiated at approximately the Eddington luminosity of the entire star. We employ the open-source stellar evolution code \\texttt{MESA} to construct quasi-star models and follow the time-dependent growth of the central BH under different prescriptions for the accretion rate at the inner boundary $R_i$, and further considering the effect of winds. For the case $R_i=NR_{\\rm B}$, where $N$ is a constant and $R_{\\rm B}$ is the Bondi radius corresponding to the mass of the BH and the gas infalling onto it, our models terminate when the BH mass reaches a critical value $M_{\\mathrm{crit}}(N)=c_{s,i}^3/(12\\sqrt{N^3G^3\\pi\\rho_i})$ (where $c_{s,i}$ and $\\rho_i$ are the sound speed and density at $R_i$, respectively), a limit we also derive analytically. Models that feature an inner convective region matched to an outer adiabatic envelope exhibit BH growth up to approximately $M_{\\mathrm{BH}}/M_\\star\\simeq 0.33$, largely independent of the stellar mass $M_\\star$ itself. This ratio is approximately preserved even in the presence of mass loss, as several properties of the model are independent of the quasi-star's total mass.",

Thieme 44 pages, 40 figures. Accepted for publication in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Recent studies indicate that the formation of planets in protoplanetary disks begins early in the embedded Class 0/I phases of protostellar evolution. The physical and chemical makeup of the embedded phase can provide valuable insights into the process of star and planet formation. This study aims to provide a thorough overview of the various morphologies for molecular emissions observed on disk scales toward nearby embedded sources. We present high angular resolution (0.1\", 15 au) molecular line emissions for $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, SO, SiO, DCN, CH$_3$OH, H$_2$CO, and c-C$_3$H$_2$ towards 19 nearby protostellar sources in the context of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Large Program \"Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk)\". Emissions in $^{12}$CO are seen towards all sources and primarily trace outflowing materials. A few sources also show high-velocity jets in SiO emission and high-velocity channel maps of $^{12}$CO. The $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O emissions are well-known tracers of high-density regions and trace the inner envelope and disk regions with clear signs of rotation seen at continuum scales. The large-scale emissions of $^{13}$CO also delineate the outflow cavity walls where the outflowing and infalling materials interact with each other, and exposure to UV radiation leads to the formation of hydrocarbons such as c-C$_3$H$_2$. Both DCN and CH$_3$OH, when detected, show compact emissions from the inner envelope and disk regions that peak at the position of the protostar. The CH$_3$OH emissions are contained within the region of DCN emissions, which suggests that CH$_3$OH traces the hot core regions. Likewise, a few sources also display emissions in CH$_3$OH towards the outflow. Both SO and H$_2$CO show complex morphology among the sources, suggesting that they are formed through multiple processes in protostellar systems.",

This drives in part the desire to construct ever-larger telescopes and interferometer arrays and to observe at shorter wavelength to lower the diffraction limit of angular resolution. Alternatively, one can aim to overcome the diffraction limit by extracting more information from a single telescope's aperture. A promising way to do this is spatial mode-based imaging, which projects focal-plane field onto a set of spatial modes before detection, retaining focal-plane phase information crucial at small angular scales but typically lost in intensity imaging. However, the practical implementation of mode-based imaging in astronomy from the ground has been challenged by atmospheric turbulence. Here, we present the first on-sky demonstration of a subdiffraction-limited, mode-based measurement using a photonic lantern (PL)-fed spectrometer installed on the SCExAO instrument at the Subaru Telescope. We introduce a novel calibration strategy that mitigates time-varying wavefront error and misalignment effects, leveraging simultaneously recorded focal-plane images and using a spectral-differential technique that self-calibrates the data. Observing the classical Be star $\\beta$ CMi, we detected spectral-differential spatial signals and reconstructed images of its H$\\alpha$-emitting disk. We achieved an unprecedented H$\\alpha$ photocenter precision of 50$\\mu$as in about 10-minute observation with a single telescope, measuring the disk's near-far side asymmetry for the first time. This work demonstrates the high precision, efficiency, and practicality of photonic mode-based imaging techniques to recover subdiffraction-limited information, opening new avenues for high angular resolution spectroscopic studies in astronomy.",

This work focuses on the procedure that is used to recover spectra encoded with multi-slit masks generated from a Hadamard matrix; the decoding process involves multiplying the output encoded spectral images by the inverse of the Hadamard matrix, which separates any spectra that were overlapping in the target object. The output from HTSI is compared to direct measurement methods, such as single-slit scanning, to evaluate its performance and identify under which conditions it can provide an advantage or disadvantage. HTSI resulted in an increase in the average signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio of spectra when signal-independent noise, such as detector read noise, is present, and has no average net effect when signal dependent-noise, such as Poisson photon noise, is the only noise source present. The SNR of emission lines was found to be greater with HTSI than with single-slit scanning under both signal-independent and signal-dependent noise, and increases as the ratio of read-to-shot noise increases.",

A shorter version of this paper will likely be published as a journal article Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Underflight maneuvers provide a unique opportunity to harmonize calibration of on-orbit sensors. Due to their similar sensor technologies, their near-identical transmission profiles, orbital properties and platform operations, the underflight data of Landsat 8 and 9 instruments stand out as a qualifier to test proposed metrics, methods, and the extent over which to compare two independently calibrated sensors across their similar operating bandpasses. This study performed a pixel-to-pixel comparison of thermal imagery of TIRS and TIRS-2 (aboard Landsat 8 and 9, respectively) during their five-day underflight maneuver in November 2021, with the ultimate goal of identifying the key site/scene-selection criteria for a subset of images that are suitable for radiative calibration validation purposes. If a group of near-coincidentally observed images by two identical underflying sensors fail to show consistent Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) Brightness Temperatures for the same exact geographical locations, then the scenes with those shared properties and/or observing conditions will prove unreliable for cross calibration validation of less-similar underflying sensor pairs. This study demonstrates that near-coincidental images with Root Mean Square Deviations (RMSDs) of less than 5\\% between their TOA radiances are optimum candidates for cross-validation of radiative calibration between two independently calibrated sensors. This criterion is shown to be reliable for coincidental acquisitions with a wide range of overlapping area, terrain type, land-to-water fraction and cloud coverage. Important considerations include any time gap between near-coincident acquisitions as well as the application of pixel quality masks. The analysis of the selected underflight scenes demonstrated an agreement between the TIRS on Landsat 8 and 9 to within 0.123 K and 0.066 K for the 10.9um and 12.0um bands respectively.",

These systematics could be time-correlated, uniform across all spectroscopic light curves, or wavelength-correlated, which could significantly affect the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres. Gaussian Processes were introduced in transmission spectroscopy by Gibson et al. (2012) to model correlated systematics in a non-parametric way. The technique uses auxiliary information about the observation and independently fits each spectroscopic light curve to provide robust atmospheric retrievals. However, this method assumes that the uncertainties in the transmission spectrum are uncorrelated in wavelength, which can cause discrepancies and degrade the precision of atmospheric retrievals. To address this limitation, we explore a 2D GP framework formulated by Fortune et al. (2024) to simultaneously model time- and wavelength-correlated systematics. We present its application to ground-based observations of TOI-4153b obtained using the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT). As we move towards detecting smaller and cooler planets, developing new methods to address complex systematics becomes increasingly essential.",

Cabezón 12 pages, 10 Figures, submitted to A&A Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Artificial viscosity is commonly employed in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to model dissipation in hydrodynamic simulations. However, its practical implementation relies on complex numerical switches to restrict its application to regions where dissipation is physically warranted, such as shocks. These switches, while essential, are imperfect and can introduce additional numerical noise. In this work we develop and validate a more efficient artificial viscosity scheme for SPH that does not rely on heuristic switches. Recent studies have proposed that subtracting the linear component of the velocity field can suppress spurious dissipation in shear-dominated regions. Building on this idea, we implement a velocity-reconstruction technique that removes the bulk linear motion from the local velocity field and uses the Balsara correction to modulate the dissipation. The presented methodology yields a balanced dissipation scheme that performs well across a range of regimes, including subsonic instabilities, shear flows, and strong shocks. We demonstrate that this approach yields improved accuracy and lower spurious dissipation compared to conventional artificial viscosity switches",

Accurate interpretation of spectra depends upon precise modeling and comprehension of Stark broadening and other mechanisms affecting spectral lines. In this context, computer simulations have emerged as valuable tools, offering idealized experiments with well-defined conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations, in particular, excel at replicating the particle interactions within the plasma and their impact on the state of a radiating atom or ion. However, these simulations present challenges in tracking electron capture processes, since setting an unambiguous criterion to distinguish between bound and free electrons is not trivial. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm that, within a classical framework, precisely identifies the scenario in which an electron is captured by an ion and then follows a stable orbit around it. The algorithm's applicability extends to emitters with charges Z >= 1. The procedure enables the correct identification of valid time-histories of the electric microfield perturbing the emitting ion, which will be used for subsequent line shape calculations. The ionization balance results obtained from the application of this algorithm are compared with an additional method based on the potential energy of the particles in the simulations, finding good agreement, therefore validating the use of this approach.",

Direct Formation of Gas Giants via Disk Fragmentation Yang Ni, Hongping Deng, Xue-Ning Bai 23 pages, 14 figures; Accepted for publication in ApJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Gravitational instability (GI) has long been considered a viable pathway for giant planet formation in protoplanetary disks (PPDs), especially at wide orbital separations or around low-mass stars where core accretion faces significant challenges. However, a primary drawback is that disk fragmentation from GI was generally found to produce over-massive clumps, typically in the mass range of brown dwarfs, although most numerical studies adopted simplified cooling prescriptions or with limited numerical resolution. We conduct a suite of global three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations of self-gravitating PPDs using the meshless finite-mass (MFM) method. By implementing radiation transport via the M1 closure and systematically varying disk mass and opacity, we show that increasing disk mass and lowering opacity promote fragmentation by enhancing radiative cooling. Non-fragmenting disks settle into a gravito-turbulent state with low-order spiral structures and effective angular momentum transport characterized by $\\alpha \\sim \\beta_\\mathrm{cool}^{-1}$. In fragmenting disks, a subset of gravitationally bound clumps survives as long-lived fragments. Their initial masses form a consistent distribution around $\\Sigma \\cdot\\lambda_\\mathrm{T} \\cdot 2 (c_s/\\Omega_\\mathrm{K})$ (with $\\lambda_T$ the Toomre wavelength), corresponding to $\\sim 0.3 - 10\\,M_\\mathrm{J}$ in our simulations, consistent with being gas giants. These results demonstrate that GI can produce planet-mass fragments under more realistic conditions, reinforcing it as a viable gas giant formation pathway and motivating further studies of fragment evolution and observational signatures.",

R. van 't Hoff Published in Nature Astronomy (this https URL). Version after refereeing but before proofing Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Water is essential to our understanding of the planet-formation process and habitability on Earth. Although trace amounts of water are seen across all phases of star and planet formation, the bulk of the water reservoir often goes undetected, hiding crucial parts of its journey from giant molecular clouds to planets. This raises the question of whether water molecules in comets and (exo-)planets is largely inherited from the interstellar medium or if the water molecules are destroyed and then reformed in the disk. Water isotopologue ratios involving doubly deuterated water (D$_2$O) are a sensitive tracer to answer this question. We present strong evidence of inheritance through an enhancement of D$_2$O in the outbursting V883 Ori disk. The high D$_2$O/H$_2$O ratio of $(3.2 \\pm 1.2) \\times 10^{-5}$ is consistent with values seen in protostellar envelopes and a comet and is two orders of magnitude higher than expected if water is reprocessed. The high deuteration of the heaviest isotopologues D$_2$O/HDO = $(2.3 \\pm 1.0) \\times $HDO/H$_2$O further establishes the inheritance of water. We conclude that water ice in disks originates from the earliest phases of star formation, providing the missing link between cold dark clouds and (exo-)comets.",

Using high-precision Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) and NEID RVs, in conjunction with archival RVs from the Keck I High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES), the Calar Alto high-Resolution search for M dwarfs with Exoearths with Near-infrared and optical Echelle Spectrograph (CARMENES), and the SPectropolarimètre InfraROUge (SPIRou), we improve the measured parameters of the known planet, GJ 251 b ($P_{b}$ = 14.2370 days; $m \\sin(i)$ = 3.85$^{+0.35}_{-0.33}$ M$_{\\oplus}$), and we significantly constrain the minimum mass of GJ 251 c, placing it in a plausibly terrestrial regime (P$_{c}$ = 53.647 $\\pm$ 0.044 days; $ m \\sin i_{c}$ = 3.84 $\\pm$ 0.75 M$_{\\oplus}$). Using activity mitigation techniques that leverage chromatic information content, we perform a color-dependent analysis of the system and a detailed comparison of more than 50 models that describe the nature of the planets and stellar activity in the system. Due to GJ 251's proximity to Earth (5.5 pc), next generation, thirty meter class telescopes will likely be able to image terrestrial planets in GJ 251's HZ. In fact, GJ 251 c is currently the best candidate for terrestrial, HZ planet imaging in the Northern Sky.",

Published in Science Advances Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The accretion ages of the first planetesimals-the parent bodies of magmatic iron meteorites-suggest they formed within the first 0.5-1 Myr of Solar System history. Yet, planetesimal formation appears to have occurred in at least two distinct phases. A temporal offset separates early-forming bodies from later-forming chondrite parent bodies, which accreted 2-3 Myr after the Solar System onset - an unresolved aspect of Solar System formation. Here we use numerical simulations to show that Jupiter's early formation reshaped its natal protoplanetary disk. Jupiter's rapid growth depleted the inner disk gas and generated pressure bumps and dust traps that manifested as rings. These structures caused dust to accumulate and led to a second-generation planetesimal population, with ages matching those of non-carbonaceous chondrites. Meanwhile, the evolving gas structure suppressed terrestrial embryos' inward migration, preventing them from reaching the innermost regions. Jupiter likely played a key role in shaping the inner Solar System, consistent with structures observed in Class II and transition disks.",

Here we investigate the dynamical states of three of the youngest multi-transiting planetary systems: AU Mic (3-planet, $\\sim$20-Myr-old), V1298 Tau (4-planet, $\\sim$23-Myr-old), and TOI-2076 (4-planet, $\\sim$200-Myr-old). We find that most planet pairs in these systems lie near resonance with circulating rather than librating resonant angles. As a result, they are more susceptible to dynamical chaos than systems that are either securely locked in resonance or far removed from it. Even modest eccentricities of 0.04 to 0.08 may drive them to instability on timescales of tens to hundreds of Myr. Moreover, the observed orbital architectures are vulnerable to eccentricity excitation through mechanisms such as divergent resonance crossing triggered by planetesimal scattering. The observed near-resonant state may represent a transitional phase between a librating resonant chains and a mature non-resonant planetary system. Finally, we briefly discuss mechanisms that could give rise to the observed near-resonant configurations, including overstable libration, disk turbulence, and receding disk inner edge.",

With reference-star differential imaging (RDI), we resolve the disk in scattered light in the F200W filter at a high signal-to-noise ratio and in the F444W filter at a low signal-to-noise ratio. The disk morphology and orientation are characterized via a forward modeling approach, where we determine a radius of 64.7-6.5+6.2 AU and an inclination of 70.1-3.3+2.5 deg. Utilizing our forward model, we improve the fidelity of the debris disk image using model-constrained RDI (MCRDI). The newly discovered disk is one of only 6 disks detected in scattered light that orbit M dwarf stars; it is the third largest of the 6 resolved M dwarf disks and orbits the third faintest host star. The detection of this disk exemplifies the sensitivity of JWST to debris disks around low-luminosity host stars, which have historically been difficult to detect because these disks are cool and dim. We identify a nebulous structure that cannot be explained by an axisymmetric disk. A search for companions in the TWA 20 system yields no candidates.",

Application to the post-impact Didymos-Dimorphos system Michalis Gaitanas, Christos Efthymiopoulos, Ioannis Gkolias, George Voyatzis, Kleomenis Tsiganis Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We develop the 3D generalization of the planar analytical theory presented in Gaitanas et. al., 2024, which deals with states slightly perturbed from the exact `single-synchronous equilibrium state' (SSES) of the full two-body problem. The SSES corresponds to two non-spherical gravitationally interacting bodies, settled in nearly circular relative orbit, with rotation axes normal to the orbital plane, rapid rotation of the primary and synchronous rotation of the secondary. In the present paper we remove all simplifying assumptions of our previous work Gaitanas et. al., 2024, and show how to compute analytical solutions describing a 3-dimensional perturbation of the system from the SSES in the framework of two distinct theories, called `linear' and `nonlinear'. Linear theory stems from averaging the equations of motion over the primary's rapid rotation angle. This maps the SSES to an equilibrium point of the averaged system, around which analytical solutions can be computed by linearization of the equations of motion. In nonlinear theory, instead, we compute a high order normal form for the Hamiltonian of motion through a sequence of canonical transformations in the form of series. Resonances between the basic system's frequencies appear in the nonlinear theory as small divisors. We show that, close to resonances, the nonlinear theory leads to a partially integrable model, sufficient to analytically describe the evolution of the relative orbit, but only of some of the Euler angles of the system. As a basic application, we compute analytical solutions representing various possible Didymos-Dimorphos post-impact orbital and rotational states. In this case, all analytical formulas here proposed are of direct utility in fitting algorithms exploiting available time series of post-impact observational data.}}",

We derive the formalism of GWs and their mixing under the same assumptions, integrating the two schemes within a unified framework. Specifically, a surface-to-exosphere parameterization of GW-induced turbulence has been derived in terms of the eddy diffusion coefficient. Simulations show that the coefficient is on the order of 1E4 to 1E9 cm2 s-1 and a turbopause is at altitudes of 70 to 140 km, varying with seasons. The triggered mixing has minor effects on model temperatures, yet it substantially impacts upper atmospheric abundances. Simulations are consistent with observations from the Mars Climate Sounder and the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer. Mixing enhances the tracer transports in the middle and upper atmosphere, governing the dynamics of these regions. The scheme reveals how non-orographic GW-induced turbulence can regulate upper atmospheric processes, such as tracer escape.",

Here, we present a first dynamical assessment of the system's stability through numerical simulations of test particles, accounting for Chiron's triaxial figure. For an equatorial ellipticity of C22~0.02, as inferred from the most recent shape estimates, our simulations reveal a chaotic inner zone extending to ~260 km, where particle lifetimes reach up to a year, while particles beyond ~260 km can remain stable for at least a decade. These results suggest that the innermost portion of the disk is ephemeral and can only persist if continuously replenished. For lower ellipticity values (C22<0.012), however, the entire disk is located within the stable region, regardless of Chiron's mass. Under the physical parameters currently available in the literature, Chi2R is possibly linked to the 1:3 spin-orbit resonance, while Chi1R cannot be linked to the 1:2 resonance, as previously proposed, since this resonance is unstable. Instead, Chi1R and Chi3R may be associated with the 2:5 and 1:5 spin-orbit resonances, respectively. Both the 1:3 and 1:5 resonances are bifurcated, generating chaotic zones that may explain the gap in Chi2R and the longitudinal asymmetry observed in Chi3R.",

Expanding the census into the hot-star regime is essential to test whether the polar preference persists across the Kraft break and to diagnose the underlying excitation mechanisms. In this work, we present Rossiter-McLaughlin observations of TOI-1135 b, a sub-Saturn orbiting a hot star with $T_{\\rm eff}=6320\\pm120$ K, using WIYN/NEID. We confirm its near-polar architecture, measuring a sky-projected obliquity of $\\lambda=-68.1^{+7.5}_{-5.3}$ degrees and a true obliquity of $\\psi=72.2^{+6.4}_{-6.6}$ degrees. Coupling our new measurement with stellar-obliquity data from the literature, we find that sub-Saturns and hot Jupiters around cool stars are unlikely to be drawn from the same parent distribution at the $5.2\\sigma$ level, consistent with weaker tidal realignment induced by lower-mass planets. Of the two known misaligned sub-Saturns around hot stars, both are near-polar, suggesting that the polar preference may extend above the Kraft break. Moreover, their obliquities lie near $\\sim 65$ degrees, supporting predictions from secular resonance crossing for sub-Saturns around rapidly rotating hot stars.",

We investigate the long-term evolution of a circumstellar disk with 0.1 $Z_{\\odot}$ over 750 kyr from its formation stage using two-dimensional thin-disk hydrodynamic simulations. The motion of dust grains is solved separately from the gas, incorporating dust growth and self-consistent radial drift. The disk is initially gravitationally unstable and undergoes intense fragmentation. By 300 kyr, it tends toward a stable state, leaving a single gravitationally bound clump. This clump generates tightly wound spiral arms through its orbital motion. After the clump dissipates at $\\sim$410 kyr, the spiral arms transition into axisymmetric substructures under the influence of viscosity. These axisymmetric substructures create local gas pressure bumps that halt the inward radial drift of dust grains, resulting in the formation of multiple-ring-shaped dust distributions. We observe several rings within $\\simeq$200 au of the central star, with separations between them on the order of $\\sim$10 au, and dust surface density contrasts with inter-ring gaps by factors of $\\sim$10-100. We also demonstrate that turbulent viscosities at observationally suggested levels are essential for converting spiral arms into axisymmetric substructures. We speculate that the physical conditions in the dust rings may be conducive to the development of streaming instability and planetesimal formation.",
