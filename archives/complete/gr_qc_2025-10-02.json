      "abstract": "AdS Length corrected Thermodynamics of a Black Hole in a Cloud of Strings and Perfect Fluid Dark Matter Nazir A. Ganaie General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The research paper investigates the thermodynamic behavior of a black hole in a cloud of strings (CoS) and perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM), incorporating a minor correction to the Anti de Sitter (AdS) length scale. The study reveals that while the entropy remains unaffected by the AdS length correction, other thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpy, free energy, pressure, internal energy, Gibbs free energy, and heat capacity exhibit significant modifications. Positive corrections to the AdS length generally enhance these quantities, leading to faster growth or slower decay with increasing black hole size, while negative corrections often produce the opposite effect, sometimes resulting in divergent or negative values. These findings highlight the sensitivity of black hole thermodynamics to geometric corrections and exotic matter fields, providing deeper information about the interplay between such modifications and thermodynamic stability. These results underscore the importance of considering minor corrections in theoretical models to better understand black hole behavior in the presence of dark matter and string-like matter distributions.",

C {\\bf 85}, 1020 (2025) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) In this Letter we propose an interpretation of the Hubble tension as an effect of the scale-running of cosmological parameters and fundamental constants, as the Newton's constant $G$ and the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$. Namely, the tension between $H_0$ measurements by CMB and Supernovae observations would be a consequence of the fact that the value of $H_0$ depends (due to the running of $G$ and $\\Lambda$) on the scale at which it is measured. Indeed, the two different values of the Hubble parameter today correspond to the two different cosmological scales at which Supernovae and CMB measurements probe our universe. We discuss some possible theoretical scenarios in which the running of $G$ and $\\Lambda$ can occur. We stress that one should interpret such a running as a scale-dependence of the cosmological parameters and fundamental constants at the same time rather than a time dependence, as it is usually considered in the literature.",

We partition fermions in two sectors and introduce two bound fields. In the effective theory approach, once all the fermions have been integrated out, the bound fields serve as the inflaton and the auxiliary field, in analogy to the hybrid inflation and accounting for a waterfall (hybrid) mechanism. The inclusion of an axial chemical potential naturally facilitates the end of reheating. During the waterfall regime, the effective potential governing the fermion condensate supports the formation of non-topological solitons, known as Q-balls, which can be accounted for seeding primordial black holes (PBHs).",

We first solve the geodesic equations in this spacetime under the influence of a GW pulse to examine how the combined effects of the dark matter halo and the GW pulse modify the geodesic deviation equation and particle trajectories. We then investigate how the memory effect manifests in the waveform in the presence of the dark matter halo. To do that, we analyze the memory contribution at asymptotic null infinity using the Bondi-Sachs formalism and, in particular, the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) flux balance laws associated with BMS symmetries. This framework allows us to quantify the GW memory contribution to the waveform, incorporate it into the ringdown waveform templates, and thereby provide a possible avenue for extracting information about the dark matter halo parameters.",

Joshi (Ahmedabad Uni., India), Sudip Bhattacharyya (TIFR, India and MIT, USA) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We investigate the tidal disruption of a neutron star (NS) near a black hole (BH), and for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, near a naked singularity (NaS). For a BH with a mass greater than about $10 M_{\\odot}$, the tidal disruption of NS should occur within the event horizon, and hence neither can the stellar material escape nor a distant observer observe the disruption. Since NaS does not have an event horizon, a significant portion of the NS's material can escape, and the tidal disruption can be observed by a distant observer. One could identify such an event from the observed emission from the disrupted NS's material and the decay of the light curve of the disruption event. The escape of a significant fraction of the NS's material may also have implications for the heavy elements in the universe. Moreover, observing such an event can be useful for confirming a NaS, probing its spacetime, and studying the motion of matter in such a geometry. This may help constrain the NS parameters and equation of state models. As a first step in this direction, we calculate here the tidal disruption radius and other parameters for a specific type (Joshi-Malafarina-Narayan type 1) of NaS and compare our results with observations.",

Here, we introduce the transverse-traceless (TT) gauge to cosmological backgrounds, and find that if we choose the TT gauge at first order, the second order tensor mode would be gauge invariant. Analogous to the Ricci flat spacetime, the vacuum condition is the key to guarantee the existence of the TT gauge on cosmological backgrounds. When we have the vacuum condition, the Poisson gauge, the uniform curvature gauge, the synchronous gauge and the total matter gauge are all equivalent to the TT gauge. Once the vacuum condition is approximately satisfied, the Poisson gauge would reduce to the TT gauge at the same order of approximation. With the sub-horizon limit, the vacuum condition could be obtained approximately, and the Poisson gauge, the uniform curvature gauge and the synchronous gauge are all approximated TT gauge. Our findings explain several existing results in the literature and indicate that the proposed TT gauge is useful to discuss higher order gravitational waves.",

The next generations of astrometric facilities are aiming at the sub-micro-arcsecond scale. Sub-micro-arcsecond astrometry requires a considerable improvement in the theory of light propagation in the curved space-time of the solar system. In particular, it is indispensable to determine light trajectories to the second order of the post-Newtonian scheme, where the monopole and quadrupole structure of some solar system bodies need to be taken into account. In reality, both the light source as well as the observer are located at finite spatial distances from the gravitating body. This fact implies for the need to solve the boundary value problem of light propagation, where the light trajectory is fully determined by the spatial positions of source and observer and its unit direction at past infinity. This problem has been solved in a recent investigation. A practical relativistic model of observational data reduction necessitates the determination of the unit tangent vector along the light trajectory at the spatial position of the observer, which is determined by a sequence of several basic transformations. The determination of this unit tangent vector allows one to calculate the impact of the monopole and quadrupole structure of solar system bodies on light deflection on the sub-micro-arcsecond level, both for stellar light sources as well as for light sources located in the solar system. Numerical values for the magnitude of light deflection caused by the monopole and quadrupole structure of the body are given for grazing light rays at the giant planets. The model GREM is presently used for data reduction of the ESA astrometry mission Gaia. It is shown how the implementation of these basic transformations into GREM would proceed for possible future space astrometry missions.",

Firstly, we perturb a bound timelike circular orbit around the black hole, and analyze the periastron precession and Lense-Thirring (LT) precession frequencies of the orbit's epicyclic oscillations. Since these epicyclic oscillations can be used to explain the quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) phenomena of the accretion disc around this rotating regular black hole, we then employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation to fit our theoretical results with five QPOs events (GRO J1655-40, GRS 1915+105, XTE J1859+226, H1743-322 and XTE J1550-564). The simulations give the relevant physical parameter space of the black hole, including the characteristic radius $r$, the mass related parameter $M$, the spinning parameter $a$ and the quantum gravity effect $\\alpha$. The results give the constraint on the quantum effect parameter, with an upper limit $\\alpha/M^{3/2} < 0.60$ at the $95\\%$ C.L., which is tighter than $<0.7014$ in our pervious study within static case. Then, we theoretically explore the LT precession frequency, geodetic precession frequency, and the general spin precession frequency of a test gyro attached to a stationary observer in this black hole background. We find that the quantum gravity effect suppresses the precession frequencies comparing against those in Kerr black hole, further providing a theoretical diagnostic of the potential quantum gravity effect.",

These solutions remain asymptotically flat and avoid central singularities while differing from the classical Kerr spacetime in the strong field region. We compute the radiative efficiency of thin accretion disks and the jet power from the Blandford Znajek mechanism, both of which depend on the deformation parameter of the model. The predictions are compared with observational estimates for six stellar mass black holes. For systems with low or moderate spin the model reproduces the data within reported uncertainties, while rapidly spinning sources such as GRS 1915 105 present tensions and point to a restricted deformation range or the need for additional physics. The results show that quantum corrections confined to the strong gravity regime can still leave detectable imprints on high energy astrophysical processes. Radiative and jet based diagnostics therefore provide a promising method to test the geometry near the horizon and to explore possible signatures of quantum gravity in observations.",

This mathematical structure consists of a principal fiber bundle over the spacetime manifold that is endowed with an affine connection. The relationship between AGT and various formulations of teleparallel theories of gravity, which are alternatives to General Relativity, are examined. Here, it is argued that the Affine Bundle is the most natural principal fibre bundle for a gauge theory of gravity. AGT is also shown to be strictly diffeomorphism invariant. In particular, an explicit proof of diffeomorphism invariance in AGT is given - showing that AGT possesses the important symmetry of General Relativity, as would be expected from a theory of gravity. Lastly, the claim that AGT is background independent, as General Relativity is, from varying degrees of strictness in the definition of background independence is closely examined. Reasons for why a background independent theory is preferred are also discussed.",

Specifically, pairs of solutions exist on two branches, corresponding to strong-field and weak-field solutions, that join at a maximum beyond which solutions cease to exist. As a result, there is a limit to the extent to which an over-density can be balanced by intrinsic rather than extrinsic curvature on the initial slice. Even below this limit, iterative methods to construct initial data may converge to solutions on either one of the two branches, depending on the starting guess, leading to potentially inconsistent physical results in the evolution.",

However, the nature of the singularity remains unclear. We therefore ask: If the initial hypersurface has sufficiently large mean curvature, does the curvature necessarily blow up towards the singularity? In case the eigenvalues of the expansion-normalized Weingarten map are everywhere distinct and satisfy a certain algebraic condition (which in 3+1 dimensions is equivalent to them being positive), we prove that this is the case in the CMC Einstein-non-linear scalar field setting. More specifically, we associate a set of geometric expansion-normalized quantities to any initial data set with positive mean curvature. These quantities are expected to converge, in the quiescent setting, in the direction of crushing big bang singularities. Our main result says that if the mean curvature is large enough, relative to an appropriate Sobolev norm of these geometric quantities, and if the algebraic condition is satisfied, then a quiescent (as opposed to oscillatory) big bang singularity with curvature blow-up forms. This provides a stable regime of big bang formation without requiring proximity to any particular class of background solutions. An important recent result by Fournodavlos, Rodnianski and Speck demonstrates stable big bang formation for all the spatially flat and spatially homogeneous solutions to the Einstein-scalar field equations satisfying the algebraic condition. Here we obtain analogous stability results for any solution inducing data at the singularity, in the sense introduced by the third author, in particular generalizing the aforementioned result. Moreover, we are able to prove both future and past global non-linear stability of a large class of spatially locally homogeneous solutions.",

B, 1018, 117073 (2025) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The Frolov black hole (BH) is a charged extension of the Hayward BH, having regularity at the central point $r = 0$ and an asymptotically Schwarzschild form for large values of $r$. Such a BH is parameterized by a length scale parameter, \\( \\alpha_0 \\). In this paper, we analyze the thermodynamic properties, null and timelike geodesics, and shadows of a Frolov BH immersed in a quintessence field. Our results indicate that the smaller BH is locally thermodynamically stable yet globally unstable at all horizon radii. Neither the quintessence parameter nor the other model parameters like the charge $q$ and length scale parameter $\\alpha_0$ change this global instability. We extend the study of the null and timelike geodesics to the vicinity of the BH by analyzing how the geodesic motion depends on the model parameters. Finally, we analyze the shadow of the BH system and find that the shadow radii are sensitively dependent on model parameters. In contrast, the influence of the quintessence parameter itself on the size of the shadow is found to be rather weak.",

Such spacetimes are also called Kerr-like spacetimes, which motivate the investigation of black holes beyond general relativity and the test of the no-hair theorem. In the present article, we consider the eccentric equatorial motion of an inspiralling object in the background of a rotating regular black hole. The dynamics generate gravitational waves (GWs) that imply a loss in energy and angular momentum of the orbiting body. In this scenario, as a result of the radiation reaction, we analytically compute the orbital evolution of the moving object. Further, we generate the gravitational waveforms and constrain the non-Kerr parameter through dephasing and mismatch computations using Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observations. Our result indicates that LISA can distinguish the effect of the additional non-Kerr/deviation parameter with the parameter as small as $\\sim10^{-6}$. The constraint on the parameter in the regular black hole using the Fisher information matrix (FIM) can be obtained within a fraction error of $10^{-5}$. The estimates of our analysis with EMRIs present the possible detectability of Kerr-like geometries with future space-based detectors, and further open up ways to put a stringent constraint on non-Kerr parameters with more advanced frameworks.",

Saridakis General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We investigate the observational implications of Wald--Gauss--Bonnet (WGB) topological dark energy, a modified cosmological framework derived from the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture applied to the Universe's apparent horizon, with the Wald--Gauss--Bonnet entropy replacing the standard Bekenstein--Hawking one. Assuming a topological connection between the apparent horizon and interior black hole (BH) horizons, we derive modified Friedmann equations where the evolution of dark energy depends on BH formation and merger rates, which are approximated by the cosmic star formation rate. These equations introduce an additional, astrophysics--dependent contribution to the cosmological constant. We test two scenarios, one with a vanishing cosmological constant ($\\Lambda = 0$) and another with a modified $\\Lambda$ against late--Universe data (SNIa, BAO, Cosmic Chronometers) via a Bayesian analysis. Although the WGB framework is consistent with observations, information criteria statistically favor the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model. An analysis of linear perturbations shows that the growth of cosmic structures is nearly indistinguishable from that of $\\Lambda$CDM, with negligible dark energy clustering and minimal deviation in the effective Newton's constant. The standard thermal history is also preserved. In conclusion, WGB cosmology presents a phenomenologically rich alternative that connects dark energy to black hole astrophysics while remaining compatible with current cosmological data.",

In recent works [1-7], the loss of coherence of quantum spatial superpositions is explored in the context of the local and global properties of spacetime. Moreover, Danielson et al [2, 3] showed that this decoherence is directly related to the memory effect, which is a prominent feature of gravitational radiation. We therefore seek to explore how a burst of gravitational radiation from a far-away source can effect the coherence of a quantum superposition. In this paper, we identify the individual contributions to the decoherence from the oscillatory and memory components of the incident gravitational wave, corresponding to hard and soft graviton emissions, respectively. In general, the memory contributions dominate, while the oscillatory component of the decoherence is strongly dependent on the phase of the burst when it is switched off. This work demonstrates how decoherence in quantum systems can arise from interactions with a classical gravitational field. We also briefly comment on the electromagnetic analogue of this effect and discuss its correspondence to the gravitational case.",

We propose a relaxed van Hove limit (i.e., late-time limit) and offer a perturbative estimate of the error order resulting from the standard derivation procedure of open quantum dynamics. Our primary findings include reliability criteria for the Markov approximation and conditions for the applicability of the rotating wave approximation (RWA). Nevertheless, the specific forms of these validity conditions rely on the details of the detector-field system, such as the spacetime background, the trajectory of the detector, and the type of quantum field being analyzed. Finally, we illustrate our results by re-examining the open dynamics of an accelerating UDW detector undergoing the Unruh effect, where the validity conditions narrow the parameter space to ensure the solution's reliability regarding the quantum Markovian master equation.",

Among those, a distinct Petrov type D family was extracted and characterized by a topological product of two-dimensional constant-curvature spaces admitting the canonical form. This is a general family of spacetimes with constant curvature and it is derived and presented here in full detail. In addition, an algebraically general solution exhibiting the exact same non-zero spin coefficients is introduced. Beyond this, we introduce an algebraically general solution, obtained by imposing the same canonical Killing tensor form and applying a Lorentz transformation within the anti-symmetric null tetrad transformation. The resulting geometry describes a non-stationary, cylindrically symmetric spacetime in vacuum with cosmological constant. On this basis, we propose a new directive: by assuming the canonical forms of Killing tensors and implementing Lorentz transformations within the anti-symmetric null tetrad concept, a broader class of algebraically general solutions of Einstein's equations can be derived.",

This work investigates the impact of such interference within the framework of massive gravity. Through simulations, we show that while the resulting correlation patterns can be described by Legendre expansions with coefficients that depend on the interference configuration, they remain predominantly quadrupolar (l = 2), with this feature becoming more pronounced as the graviton mass increases--reflecting both the tensorial polarizations and the modified GW dispersion. However, the interference introduces significant variability in the angular correlation, making it difficult to distinguish massive gravity from general relativity based on a single realization of the Universe. We conclude that beyond a fundamental constraint set by the PTA observation time, achieving a substantially tighter bound on the graviton mass is statistically challenging and observationally limited under realistic conditions.",

Applications of the method to astrophysical systems such as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), in particular to megamaser systems orbiting the central BH on their flat accretion disks, showed a coupling behavior in the mass-to-distance ratio $M/D$. Estimates for the ratio $M/D$ of a sample of BHs hosted at the core of several AGNs have been performed in recent years with the help of this method. However, both analytical expressions and statistical estimations depend only on the $M/D$ ratio rather than on independent parameters. It is of current general interest to work with decoupled parameters in order to safeguard the intrinsic physical information encoded in each of them, given their high scientific relevance in understanding the structure of our Universe. The purpose of this work is to find analytical expressions for the mass and distance of a Schwarzschild BH in terms of astrophysical observations by introducing a slight warping in the accretion disk of the orbiting megamasers. As a result, independent analytical formulas for the mass and distance of AGN supermassive BHs are presented in terms of astrophysical observations: maser frequency shifts, disk parameters, and the galaxy's peculiar redshift.",
