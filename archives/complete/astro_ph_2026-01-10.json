Data release at this https URL Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex) Binary black holes (BBHs) exhibiting spin-induced orbital precession offer unique insight into compact-binary formation channels, cosmology, and tests of general relativity. We conduct a dedicated search for precessing BBHs in Advanced LIGO's third observing run (O3) using the harmonic decomposition method of precessing waveforms. We introduce a novel scheme to reduce the number of filters in a harmonic search. With our new approach, our template bank requires $5\\times$ fewer filters compared to another proposed precessing search in the same region. We do not find any new significant events. Our new search method achieves up to $\\sim 28\\%$ improvement in sensitivity and up to $5\\times$ lower computational costs compared to existing precessing search pipelines. Our method enables scalable, sensitive searches for precessing BBHs in future gravitational-wave observing runs.",

Here we consider such encounters between an intermediate mass spinning black hole and a close identical white dwarf binary system whose center of mass follows a parabolic trajectory. After studying a corresponding three-body problem in the point particle approximation, we perform a suite of smoothed particle hydrodynamics based numerical simulations of such scenarios. For this, we integrate the geodesic equations for the spinning black hole, while considering the hydrodynamics and the self and mutual gravitational interactions of the stars in a Newtonian approximation, an approach justified by the choice of parameters in the theory. We consider various initial configurations of the binary center of mass leading to equatorial and off-equatorial orbits, as also various initial inclinations between the binary's initial spin angular momentum and its initial orbital angular momentum. We find that the effects of black hole spin manifest clearly in the tidal dynamics of the binary components, while the observables of tidal encounters such as mass fallback rates are strongly dependent on the initial inclination angle. We show that the influence of the black hole spin emerges in distinct ways for different initial configurations of the binary's spin alignment. We establish that within the ambits of the Hills mechanism, in certain cases, the fallback rate may show a three-hump structure, due to interactions between tidal debris of the individual stars.",

While these jets can be reproduced by the general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) and particle-in-cells (GRPIC) simulations of the dynamical Kerr magnetosphere, the development of analytic models to describe the physics of the jets has remained limited. A key challenge is to analytically describe the individual trajectories of accelerated charged particles which ultimately build up the jet and emit radiation. In this work, we provide a first simple but fully analytical model of jet launching from the Kerr magnetosphere based on the motion of charged particles. To that end, we use the integrability of electrogeodesic motion in the Kerr monopole magnetosphere to study the ejection of charged particles near the poles. This enables us to derive (i) a criterion for the rotation axis to constitute a stable latitunal equilibrium position, thereby representing an idealized jet, (ii) the expression for the magnetic frame-dragging effect, and (iii) the condition for an asymptotic observer to measure blueshifted particles emanating from the black hole surroundings. Our study reveals that particles can be accelerated only in a specific region whose maximal radius depends on the spin and magnetization of the black hole. Alongside these results, we provide a detailed review of the construction of test magnetospheres from (explicit and hidden) symmetries of the Kerr geometry and the condition for the separability of the electrogeodesic motion in a test magnetosphere, which serves as a basis for the model we study in this work.",

Current constraints leave the asteroid-mass window the only possible one for PBH to account for all the dark matter, which can only be probed indirectly by the scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs) sourced by the curvature perturbation which forms PBH. In this work, we explore the capabilities of future space-based gravitational wave detectors, including LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, to constrain such induced GWs as well as the PBH abundance. We systematically account for the width of the primordial curvature power spectrum, and find that the asteroid-mass window can be fully probed by all three space-based interferometers. If PBHs constitute the majority of dark matter, the induced GW leaves a strong signal in the mHz band with a signal-to-noise ratio of $10^3\\sim10^4$.",

We show that the previously reported unphysical breakdown of the predicted Newtonian force in certain Galileon models is controlled by a single condition linking non-linear void dynamics to the cosmic expansion history. This connection yields a redshift-dependent upper bound on the allowed depth of voids and promotes this requirement to a new viability condition, complementary to standard stability criteria.

Extending the previous work, we explore the potential of 3G GW standard siren observations in cosmological parameter estimation by considering their associated electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, including $\\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) coincidence observations by the Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor and GW-triggered target-of-opportunity observations of kilonovae by different optical survey projects.

For the cosmological analysis, we find that with the inclusion of GW-kilonova detections, the constraints on cosmological parameters from GW-EM detections are significantly improved compared to those from GW-GRB detections. In particular, GW-EM detections can tightly constrain the Hubble constant with a precision ranging from $0.076\\%$ to $0.034\\%$. Moreover, GW multi-messenger observations could effectively break the cosmological parameter degeneracies generated by the mainstream EM observations, CMB+BAO+SN (CBS). The combination of CBS and GW-EM can tightly constrain the equation of state parameters of dark energy $w$ in the $w$CDM model and $w_0$ in the $w_0w_a$CDM model with precisions of $0.72\\%$ and $0.99\\%$, respectively, meeting the standard of precision cosmology.

D 112, 103043 (2025) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Machine Learning (stat.ML) The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to detect thousands of individually resolved gravitational wave sources, overlapping in time and frequency, on top of unresolved astrophysical and/or primordial backgrounds. Disentangling resolved sources from backgrounds and extracting their parameters in a computationally intensive \"global fit\" is normally regarded as a necessary step toward reconstructing the properties of the underlying astrophysical populations. Here, we show that it is in principle feasible to infer the population properties of the most numerous of LISA sources -- Galactic double white dwarfs -- directly from the frequency (or, equivalently, time) strain series by adopting a simulation-based approach, without extracting and estimating the parameters of each single source. By training a normalizing flow on a custom-designed compression of simulated LISA frequency series from the Galactic double white dwarf population, we demonstrate how to infer the posterior distribution of population parameters (e.g., mass function, frequency, and spatial distributions). This allows for extracting information on the population parameters from both resolved and unresolved sources simultaneously and in a computationally efficient manner. This approach can be extended to other source classes (e.g., massive and stellar-mass black holes, extreme mass ratio inspirals) and to scenarios involving non-Gaussian or non-stationary noise (e.g., data gaps), provided that fast and accurate simulations are available.",

It might be promising to serve as a unique laboratory for exploring the accretion matter near black holes or testing Einstein's gravity. Recent studies debated whether there is a non-Keplerian motion of the flares in the GRAVITY dataset. This motivates us to present a comprehensive analysis based on error estimation under the Bayesian framework. This study uses astrometric flare data to investigate the possibility that the flares exhibit deviations from the circular Keplerian motion. We analyze both averaged and individual flare data, modeling the hotspot with either circular orbits parameterized by a non-Keplerian correction or planar geodesic orbits. It is confirmed that the astrometric data favor the circular orbits over non-circular ones, with the orbital circularity parameter of $\\gamma = 0.99_{-0.10}^{+0.07}$. Our results show that the joint posteriors for black hole mass and non-Keplerian parameter are negatively correlated. Fixing the mass to be its established value yields a non-Keplerian parameter of $\\omega/\\omega_k = 1.45^{+0.35}_{-0.38}$, at approximately the 1$\\sigma$ level. The statistical significance is insufficiently high, and the conclusion is found to be sensitive to the presence of correlations in the astrometric data, which might originate from the non-uniform $u$-$v$ coverage in interferometer measurements. In this sense, the current data might be insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion regarding the presence of non-Keplerian motion. Future improvements in astrometry precision might enable stronger constraints on the kinematical behavior of the flares.",

This result indicates a stronger scale invariance of the scalar perturbation than earlier estimates, posing challenges for numerous inflation models. In this work, we propose a novel inflationary scenario based on Weyl scale-invariant gravity, where the quadratic curvature establishes the scale invariance of the scalar spectrum, while the higher-order extensions imprint the observed slight deviation. Specifically, the exponential curvature extensions are introduced to suppress the mass divergence of the inflaton. We find such scenario naturally yields leading-order predictions of $n_s\\simeq1-3/(2N)\\sim0.97-0.975$ or $n_s\\simeq1-5/(3N)\\sim0.967-0.972$ for various models, in excellent agreement with the ACT/SPT constraints.

Motivated by the Trans-Planckian problem and potential non-canonical dynamics in the early Universe, we introduce a generalized Sasaki-Mukhanov equation characterized by a time-dependent correction term, parameterized by a coupling constant f. Unlike the standard slow-roll approximation, we derive the exact analytical solutions for the mode functions in terms of Whittaker functions, ensuring a precise treatment of the mode evolution across the horizon. We compute the resulting primordial scalar power spectrum, which exhibits scale-dependent oscillatory modulations and a distinct suppression of power at low multipoles. We numerically implement this modified framework within the Cobaya Bayesian inference engine. Utilizing the latest Planck 2018 temperature and polarization likelihoods combined with high-resolution data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6, we perform a robust Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) analysis. Our results place stringent constraints on the modification parameter, |f| <= 10^-4, at a 95% confidence level. However, we find intriguing hints that the generalized model provides a better fit to the low-l CMB spectrum compared to the standard LambdaCDM model, effectively alleviating the low-quadrupole anomaly without compromising the fit at smaller scales. We discuss the implications of these findings for the energy scale of inflation and the validity of the effective field theory description during the inflationary epoch.",

Ligori 29 pages, 13 figures, abstract abridged for arxiv submission Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The Euclid satellite will measure spectroscopic redshifts for tens of millions of emission-line galaxies. In the context of Stage-IV surveys, the 3-dimensional clustering of galaxies plays a key role in providing cosmological constraints. In this paper, we conduct a model comparison for the multipole moments of the galaxy 2-point correlation function (2PCF) in redshift space. We test state-of-the-art models, in particular the effective field theory of large-scale structure (EFT), one based on the velocity difference generating function (VDG$_{\\infty}$), and different variants of Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT) models, such as convolutional LPT (CLPT) and its effective-field-theory extension (CLEFT). We analyse the first three even multipoles of the 2PCF in the Flagship 1 simulation, which consists of four snapshots at $z\\in\\{0.9,1.2,1.5,1.8\\}$. We study both template-fitting and full-shape approaches and find that with the template-fitting approach, only the VDG$_{\\infty}$ model is able to reach a minimum fitting scale of $s_{\\rm min}=20\\,h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$ at $z=0.9$ without biasing the recovered parameters. Indeed, the EFT model becomes inaccurate already at $s_{\\rm min}=30\\,h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$. Conversely, in the full-shape analysis, the CLEFT and VDG$_{\\infty}$ models perform similarly well, but only the CLEFT model can reach $s_{\\rm min}=20\\,h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$ while the VDG$_{\\infty}$ model is unbiased down to $s_{\\rm min}=25\\,h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$ at the lowest redshift. Overall, in order to achieve the accuracy required by Euclid, non-perturbative modelling such as in the VDG$_{\\infty}$ or CLEFT models should be considered. At $z=1.8$, the CLPT model is sufficient to describe the data with high figure of merit. This comparison selects baseline models that perform best in ideal conditions and sets the stage for an optimal analysis of Euclid data in configuration space.",

Ferreira 21 pages, 5 figures; submitted to MNRAS Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The structure of dark matter haloes is often described by radial density profiles motivated by cosmological simulations. These are typically assumed to have a fixed functional form (e.g. NFW), with some free parameters that can be constrained with observations. However, relying on simulations has the disadvantage that the resulting profiles depend on the dark matter model and the baryonic physics implementation, which are highly uncertain. Instead, we present a method to constrain halo density profiles directly from observations. This is done using a symbolic regression algorithm called Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR). ESR searches for the optimal analytic expression to fit data, combining both accuracy and simplicity. We apply ESR to a sample of 149 galaxy clusters from the HSC-XXL survey to identify which functional forms perform best across the entire sample of clusters. We identify density profiles that statistically outperform NFW under a minimum-description-length criterion. Within the radial range probed by the weak-lensing data ($R \\sim 0.3 - 3$ h$^{-1}$ Mpc), the highest-ranked ESR profiles exhibit shallow inner behaviour and a maximum in the density profile. As a practical application, we show how the best-fitting ESR models can be used to obtain enclosed mass estimates. We find masses that are, on average, higher than those derived using NFW, highlighting a source of potential bias when assuming the wrong density profile. These results have important knock-on effects for analyses that utilise clusters, for example cosmological constraints on $\\sigma_8$ and $\\Omega_m$ from cluster abundance and clustering. Beyond the HSC dataset, the method is readily applicable to any data constraining the dark matter distribution in galaxies and galaxy clusters, such as other weak lensing surveys, galactic rotation curves, or complementary probes.",

Bach Submitted for review to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The 21cm signal of neutral hydrogen contains a wealth of information about the poorly constrained era of cosmological history, the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Recently, AI models trained on EoR simulations have gained significant attention as a powerful and flexible option for inferring parameters from 21cm observations. However, previous works show that AI models trained on data from one simulator fail to generalize to data from another, raising doubts about AI models' ability to accurately infer parameters from observation. We develop a new strategy for training AI models on cosmological simulations based on the principle that increasing the diversity of the training dataset improves model robustness by averaging out spurious and contradictory information. We train AI models on data from different combinations of four simulators, then compare the models' performance when predicting on data from held-out simulators acting as proxies for the real universe. We find that models trained on data from multiple simulators perform better on data from a held-out simulator than models trained on data from a single simulator, indicating that increasing the diversity of the training dataset improves a model's ability to generalize. This result suggests that future EoR parameter inference methods can mitigate simulator-specific bias by incorporating multiple simulation approaches into their analyses.",

This can be simply realized with a standard quintessence scalar field that controls the DM mass. In particular a background with phantom crossing can be effectively realized without introducing ghosts or other pathologies. For example one can reproduce exactly the background that gives the best fit to the recent DESI+CMB+DESY5 data, within the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization of DE. Although the background evolution is identical, the perturbations differ, leading to modified growth of structures. If the DM mass varies at late times, early-time observables are not modified and can reproduce the main predictions of the target model, but late-time observables are affected. We discuss in particular the effects on the matter power spectrum, CMB lensing and ISW effect. When reproducing the best fit CPL background model, this scenario generically predicts $\\mathcal{O}(10\\%)$ deviations in such observables. However, for suitable choices of parameters, effects on the matter power spectrum can be smaller, motivating a detailed study. In general, energy exchange between DE and DM generates a mismatch between the matter power spectrum and the gravitational potential amplitudes compared to the decoupled case, that can lead to deviations observable in future experiments.",

Recent JWST observations reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of overmassive black holes at z>4-6, where the BH masses lie far above local scaling relations and not reproduced by current cosmological models. How such overmassive black holes form and rapidly grow within young galaxies has remained unclear. Here we present fully cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic simulations that, for the first time, self-consistently follow the birth, early growth, and emergent observable signatures of SMBHs in proto-cluster environments. We find that heavy seeds of order $10^6 M_\\text{sun}$ naturally form, exceeding typical theoretical expectations by an order of magnitude. These seeds rapidly develop dense, optically thick disks whose strong electron scattering produces broad H$\\alpha$ emission comparable to that seen in little red dots (LRDs). Sustained super-Eddington accretion then drives fast growth to $\\sim 3 \\times 10^7 ~M_\\text{sun}$ by $z \\sim 8$. These results provide a unified physical scenario in which LRDs correspond to a short-lived, enshrouded phase of heavy-seed formation, naturally evolving into the overmassive quasars detected by JWST and ultimately the progenitors of today's SMBHs.",

      "abstract": "Environmental Decoupling: Reconciling SNe Ia Time Dilation with Null Variations of $α$ Seokcheon Lee Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The Generalized Cosmological Time (GCT) framework interprets the observed time dilation in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as a manifestation of a generalized lapse function in the background metric, favoring a parameter value b \\approx 0.04. However, precision spectroscopic measurements of the fine-structure constant \\alpha via the alkali doublet (AD) and many-multiplet (MM) methods predominantly yield null results. In this work, I demonstrate that this discrepancy is not a sensitivity limitation but a fundamental physical consequence of distinguishing between global coordinate time and local proper time. By inverting the GCT scaling relations, I establish that spectroscopic data constrain the effective parameter to |b_{\\text{local}}| \\lesssim 10^{-5}, revealing a tension of three orders of magnitude against the background value. I resolve this by invoking the principle of environmental shielding. I argue that dense, virialized gas clouds maintain a static local metric that is dynamically decoupled from the background cosmological time flow, strictly analogous to the detachment of bound systems from the Hubble expansion. Consequently, atomic spectra probe a shielded local frame where physical constants remain invariant, whereas SNe Ia observations measure the accumulated geometric time dilation of photons traversing the expanding background. This framework reconciles the positive dilation signals in geometric probes with the stability of fundamental constants in local bound systems without modifying local physical laws.",

B 868 (2025) 139673 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Five dimensional (5D) uniform inflation describes a de Sitter (or approximate) solution of 5D Einstein equations, with cosmological constant and a 5D Planck scale $M_* \\sim 10^9$ GeV. During the inflationary period all dimensions (compact and non-compact) expand exponentially in terms of the 5D proper time. This set-up requires about 40 $e$-folds to expand the fifth dimension from the fundamental length to the micron size. At the end of 5D inflation (or at any given moment during the inflationary phase) one can interpret the solution in terms of 4D fields using 4D Planck units from the relation $M_p^2 = 2 \\pi R M_*^3$, which amounts going to the 4D Einstein frame. This implies that if the compactification radius $R$ expands $N$ $e$-folds, then the 3D space would expand $3N/2$ $e$-folds as a result of a uniform 5D inflation. We reexamine the primordial power spectrum predicted by this model and show that it is consistent with Planck's measurements of the comic microwave background. The best-fit to Planck data corresponds to $R \\sim 10~\\mu$m. A departure of the angular power spectrum predicted by 4D cosmology is visible at multipole moment $\\ell \\sim 7$.",

We study this effect by analyzing galaxy samples selected according to stellar mass, luminosity, and broad-band colors from the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation. We find that galaxy assembly bias depends strongly upon the selection criteria, number density, and redshift of the galaxy sample, with this effect increasing or decreasing galaxy clustering by as much as 25%. Interestingly, no single secondary halo property fully captures the strength of galaxy assembly bias for any galaxy population. Therefore, empirical models predicting galaxy assembly bias as a function of a single halo property cannot reproduce predictions from hydrodynamical simulations. Finally, we investigate how galaxy assembly bias arises from the interplay between halo assembly bias -- the dependence of halo clustering on properties other than halo mass -- and occupancy variation -- the correlation between galaxy occupation and secondary halo properties. We provide a fast analytical expression to predict the level of galaxy assembly bias induced by any halo property in simulated galaxy catalogs without the need for computationally expensive shuffling techniques.",

Through systematic investigation of various gravitational production channels, we reveal distinctive features compared to the standard inflation scenario. Notably, the inflaton annihilation channel in warm inflation exhibits markedly different thermodynamics from the standard inflation paradigm, leading to a suppression on the production of sub-inflaton-mass dark matter. For the production channel of inflationary vacuum fluctuations, we find an abundance-mass correlation of $\\rho_\\chi\\propto m_\\chi^{1/2}(m_\\chi^{5/2})$ for the sub-Hubble-mass dark matter with minimal(conformal) coupling. Our results also indicate that a minimum temperature threshold of $10^{-6}M_P$ is necessary for warm inflation, which allows adequate dark matter production. With observational constraints, our results provide stringent limits on the mass range of purely gravitational dark matter with sufficient density: $10^{-8}-10^{-2}M_P$ for minimal coupling and $10^{-14}-10^{-2}M_P$ for conformal coupling.",

Vikram 21 pages, 17 figures, matched to accepted version for MNRAS Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We measure the correspondence between the distribution of galaxies and matter around troughs and peaks in the projected galaxy density, by comparing \\texttt{redMaGiC} galaxies ($0.15<z<0.65$) to weak lensing mass maps from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 data release. We obtain stacked profiles, as a function of angle $\\theta$, of the galaxy density contrast $\\delta_{\\rm g}$ and the weak lensing convergence $\\kappa$, in the vicinity of these identified troughs and peaks, referred to as `void' and `cluster' superstructures. The ratio of the profiles depend mildly on $\\theta$, indicating good consistency between the profile shapes. We model the amplitude of this ratio using a function $F(\\eta, \\theta)$ that depends on cosmological parameters $\\eta$, scaled by the galaxy bias. We construct templates of $F(\\eta, \\theta)$ using a suite of $N$-body (`Gower Street') simulations forward-modelled with DES Y3-like noise and systematics. We discuss and quantify the caveats of using a linear bias model to create galaxy maps from the simulation dark matter shells. We measure the galaxy bias in three lens tomographic bins (near to far): $2.32^{+0.86}_{-0.27}, 2.18^{+0.86}_{-0.23}, 1.86^{+0.82}_{-0.23}$ for voids, and $2.46^{+0.73}_{-0.27}, 3.55^{+0.96}_{-0.55}, 4.27^{+0.36}_{-1.14}$ for clusters, assuming the best-fit \\textit{Planck} cosmology. Similar values with $\\sim0.1\\sigma$ shifts are obtained assuming the mean DES Y3 cosmology. The biases from troughs and peaks are broadly consistent, although a larger bias is derived for peaks, which is also larger than those measured from the DES Y3 $3\\times2$-point analysis. This method shows an interesting avenue for measuring field-level bias that can be applied to future lensing surveys.",

The purpose of the current survey is to create a redshift space template for 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen with which to correlate radio line intensity observations by the Tianlai dish and cylinder interferometers. A total of 898 redshifts were obtained from the 2102 extended objects in the NCCS with m_V < 19 in the survey area. After accounting for extinction, the survey geometry and selection effects, the number density and clustering pattern of galaxies in the redshift catalog are consistent with other low redshift surveys.

Extended for distinguishing cores from SIDM vs. stellar feedback. Matches the accepted version by ApJL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) High-velocity collisions between gas-rich ultra-diffuse galaxies present a promising formation channel for dark-matter-deficient galaxies (DMDGs). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we show that the progenitors' baryonic binding energy, $|E_{\\rm bind}|$, critically controls the outcome. Repeated potential fluctuations, e.g., from bursty feedback, inject energy and reduce $|E_{\\rm bind}|$ by $\\approx 15\\%$, yielding fewer but substantially more massive DMDGs. By contrast, elastic self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) produces comparable cores without lowering $|E_{\\rm bind}|$, perturbing DMDG masses without clear enhancement. This differs from what happens in host halos, where SIDM-induced cores enhance dark matter tidal stripping while keeping baryons compact and resilient to tidal effects. The contrasting roles of SIDM may provide a means to distinguish feedback-formed halo cores from those created by SIDM. Among 15 paired simulation runs, 13 show higher DMDG masses in the weakened-binding case, and about two thirds exhibit $>100\\%$ mass enhancements. The simulations also predict systematically lower gas fractions due to sustained post-collision star formation, yielding a clean observational signature. Upcoming wide-field imaging (CSST, LSST), HI surveys (FAST), and kinematic follow-up will be crucial to test this scenario.",

Lattimer High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th) We propose a new Bayesian framework to infer the neutron star equation of state (EOS) from mass and radius observations and neutron matter theory by defining priors that directly parameterize mass-radius space instead of pressure-energy density space. We use direct and accurate inversion approximations to map mass-radius relations to the underlying EOS. We systematically compare its EOS inferences with those inferred from traditional EOS parameterizations, taking care to quantify the systematic prior uncertainties of both. Our results show that prior uncertainties should be included in all Bayesian approaches. The more natural alternative framework provides broader coverage of the physically allowed mass-radius space, especially small radius configurations, and yields enhanced computational efficiency and substantially reduced dependence on prior choices. Our results demonstrate that direct parameterization in observed space offers a robust and efficient alternative to traditional methods.",

In one epoch, we detect sub-mHz quasi-periodic oscillations with significance tested via MCMC-based red-noise simulations (p $\\leq 0.03$). AT2019teq exhibits a clear spectral evolution from a soft (blackbody-dominated) state to a hard (power-law-dominated) state, with a late-time radio brightening that may be associated with the state transition. We identify similarities between AT2019teq's evolution and X-ray binary soft-to-hard state transitions, albeit at higher luminosity and much faster timescales. We use the presence of both a disk-dominated and a corona-dominated state to apply multiple mass estimators from X-ray spectral and variability properties.

Mingo, Fangzheng Shi, Jiang-Tao Li Submitted to ApJ; 14 pages, 9 figures High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Fermi and eROSITA bubbles in the Milky Way represent an archetypal case of galactic nucleus feedback, yet their origin remains highly debated. Here we use hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the formation of the \"Fermi bubbles\" in the nearby Circinus galaxy, a pair of kpc-scaled elliptical bubbles seen in both radio and X-ray observations. We find that a pair of active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets drive forward shocks in the circumgalactic medium, and after evolving for ~0.95 Myr, the shock-delineated bubble pair roughly matches the observed Circinus bubbles in size and morphology. Our mock X-ray image and spectrum reproduce the observed edge-brightened X-ray surface brightness distribution and spectrum quite well, and suggest that non-thermal emissions from the jet ejecta also contribute substantially to radio and X-ray emissions from the inner \"hotspot\" region. We further show that AGN winds tend to produce more spherical bubbles with a wider base near the galactic plane, inconsistent with observations. The hotspot emissions and the misalignment between the galaxy rotational axis and the bubble's axis argue against a starburst wind origin. Our study thus corroborates the AGN jet-shock model for the origin of both the Circinus bubbles and the Fermi bubbles, and suggests that AGN jet feedback may be a common origin of extended gaseous bubbles in regular disk galaxies, potentially playing an important role in their evolution.",

Using grids of detailed MESA simulations, we show that for donor masses of $2-8\\,M_{\\odot}$, mass transfer may be dynamically unstable, leading to a common envelope (CE) phase. By adopting CE ejection efficiencies in the range $\\alpha_{\\rm CE} = 0.3-3.0$, we find that post-CE binaries frequently experience a CE decoupling phase (CEDP), which plays a critical role in determining their final orbital and compositional properties. Systems with initial donor masses $\\gtrsim 3.5\\,M_{\\odot}$ predominantly evolve into NS binaries with carbon-oxygen or oxygen-neon white dwarfs (WDs) with masses between $0.5\\,M_{\\odot}$ and $1.4\\,M_{\\odot}$. Comparison with the observed population of binary pulsars with a WD companion shows better agreement with higher CE ejection efficiencies ($\\alpha_{\\rm CE} = 3.0$). Furthermore, we demonstrate that NSs can accrete a sufficient amount of matter ($\\gtrsim 0.01\\,M_{\\odot}$) during the CEDP and subsequent Case BA/BB/BC mass transfer phases to be effectively recycled into millisecond pulsars. We identify two distinct evolutionary channels capable of reproducing the observed characteristics of the millisecond pulsar PSR J1928+1815 with a helium-star companion.

Wainscoat 17 pages, 10 figures, to be submitted to MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Tidal disruption event (TDE) light curves are increasingly used to infer the masses of quiescent supermassive black holes ($M_{\\rm{BH}}$), offering a powerful probe of low-mass black hole demographics independent of host-galaxy scaling relations. However, the reliability of most semi-analytic TDE models assume full stellar disruption, despite theoretical expectations that partial disruptions dominate the TDE population. In this work we test the robustness of current TDE models using three repeating partial TDEs (rpTDEs), in which the multiple flares produced by the same surviving stellar core must yield consistent black hole masses. We present spectroscopic observations establishing AT 2023adr as a rpTDE, making it the third such spectroscopically confirmed event. We independently model the flares of the three rpTDEs; 2020vdq, 2022dbl, and 2023adr, applying fallback-accretion fits, stream-stream collision scaling relations, luminosity-based empirical relations, and cooling-envelope fits. After accounting for statistical and model-specific systematics, we find that all TDE models generally return self-consistent $M_{\\rm{BH}}$ values between flares, and are broadly consistent with host-galaxy $M_{\\rm{BH}}$ proxies, recovering $M_{\\rm{BH}}$ to within 0.3-0.5 dex. However, the convergence of fallback models towards unphysical stellar masses and impact parameters reveals limitations in the existing fallback model grids. We also show that light curve coverage, particularly in the near-UV, is critical for constraining model parameters. This has direct implications for interpreting the thousands of TDE light curves expected from upcoming surveys such as the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, where from simulations, we find that $M_{\\rm{BH}}$ may be underestimated on average by 0.5 dex without additional follow-up.",

Mumpower, Yong-Zhong Qian High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th) Nuclear yields are powerful probes of supernova explosions, their engines and their progenitors. In addition, as we improve our understanding of these explosions, we can use nuclear yields to probe dense matter and neutrino physics, both of which play a critical role in the central supernova engine. Especially with upcoming gamma-ray detectors that can directly detect radioactive isotopes out to increasing distances from gamma-rays emitted during their decay, nuclear yields have the potential to provide some of the most direct probes of supernova engines and stellar burning. To utilize these probes, we must understand and limit the uncertainties in their production. Uncertainties in the nuclear physics can be minimized by combining both laboratory experiments and nuclear theory. Similarly, astrophysical uncertainties caused by simplified explosion trajectories can be minimized by higher-fidelity stellar-evolution and supernova-engine models. This paper reviews the physics and astrophysics uncertainties in modeling nucleosynthetic yields, identifying the key areas of study needed to maximize the potential of supernova yields as probes of astrophysical transients and dense-matter physics.",

Accepted for publication in MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The jet compositions of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are very important to understand the energy dissipation and radiation mechanisms, but it remains an open question in GRB physics. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis to search for 88 bright GRBs that include a total of 129 pulses observed by Fermi/GBM with redshift measured, and extract the spectra of each pulse with Band function (Band), cutoff power-law (CPL), blackbody (BB), non-dissipative photospheric (NDP), Band+BB, as well as CPL+BB. We find that 80 pulses, 35 pulses, and 14 pulses present purely non-thermal, hybrid, and thermal spectra, respectively. By focusing on those 80 pulses with purely non-thermal spectra, one can estimate the lower limits of magnetization factor ($\\sigma$) via suppressing the pseudo-thermal component. It is found that 30 pulses in 21 GRBs are the lower limit of $\\sigma>5$ at the photosphere by adopting $R_{0}=10^{10}$ cm. It suggests that at least the outflow of those GRB jets with high $\\sigma$ is dominated by Poynting-flux. On the other hand, we also perform the light curve fitting with a fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED) model for 15 bright GRBs with a high magnetization factor in our sample, and find that a correlation between pulse width ($w$) and energy of 13 GRBs really exists in their energy-resolved light curves. It is also a piece of independent evidence for those GRBs with a high value $\\sigma$ to support the origin of the Poynting flux outflow.",

Chandra 8 Table, 6 Figures, Accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present the UV/X-ray joint spectral analyses of four Seyfert~1 galaxies (PG 0804+761, NGC 7469, SWIFT J1921.1-5842, and SWIFT J1835.0+3240) using the data acquired with the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope and Soft X-ray Telescope onboard AstroSat. We model the intrinsic UV/X-ray continuum with the accretion disk, warm and hot Comptonization using the OPTXAGNF and FAGNSED models, where the disk seed photons are Comptonized in the warm and hot corona. The Eddington ratio of the four Seyferts ranges from 0.01 to 1. In the case of SWIFT J1835.0$+$3240, we infer a compact warm corona ($ R_{warm} - R_{hot} \\lesssim 18 r_{g}$) while, PG 0804+761, NGC 7469, and SWIFT J1921.1-5842 may exhibit a larger warm Comptonizing region ($\\gtrsim 32r_{g}$). We could constrain the spin parameter in PG 0804+761, $a^{\\star} = 0.76_{-0.20}^{+0.08}$ (1$\\sigma$ error), with the FAGNSED model. In SWIFT J1835.0+3240 and SWIFT J1921.1-5842, the UV/X-ray spectral variability may be driven by the thermal Comptonization of the disk seed photons in the hot corona. Furthermore, the observed spectral hardening with the decrease in disk temperature and accretion rate compared to earlier observations may indicate a state transition in SWIFT J1835.0+3240 from a high/soft to a low/hard state.",

Zhao High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Abell 3571 is a nearby, X-ray bright galaxy cluster located in the Shapley Supercluster. Although it appears morphologically relaxed in X-ray images, multiwavelength observations reveal subtle indications of residual dynamical activity, likely associated with past merger events. Using wide-field ($1^{\\circ} \\times 1^{\\circ}$) data from the Einstein Probe Follow-up X-ray Telescope (EP-FXT), we extend measurements of the cluster's properties beyond its $R_{500}$ radius. We detect surface-brightness excesses on both the northern and southern sides, consistent with previous XMM-Newton results. The temperature, pressure, and entropy in the northern excess region are lower than the average values, whereas those on the southern side are slightly higher. However, we find no evidence for cold fronts or shocks. These features can be interpreted as sloshing motions triggered by an off-center minor merger. Our findings suggest that, despite its symmetric appearance, A3571 is still recovering from a minor merger and is currently in a post-merger phase. This work also demonstrates the excellent capability of EP-FXT for probing the outskirts of galaxy clusters.",

We developed a package for investigating time-varying spectral behavior for full Stokes parameters and demonstrate it on a millisecond pulsar (MSP) J2144-5237 in a binary system (orbital period ~10 days) using the Parkes UWL receiver. In this study we report rotation measure (RM) variation with orbital phase. We find that the temporal variations in the spectra of Stokes I, Q, and V are generally correlated throughout the orbit, while Stokes U exhibits intervals of both correlation and anticorrelation with Stokes I, depending on the orbital phase. We also provide a Poincare sphere representation of the polarization properties of J2144-5237, demonstrating a systematic temporal change of Poincare sphere location for the main component with orbital phase. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of time-varying properties of the spectro-polarimetric nature of any pulsars or MSPs. Extending this study to probe the spectro-temporal nature of full Stokes data on a larger sample of MSPs or pulsars has the potential to provide vital information on emission mechanisms inside the magnetosphere, interstellar propagation effects, and binary interactions.",

Katz High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) I suggest that some of the mysterious temporal properties of Fast Radio Bursts (FRB) may be explained if they are produced by dynamically triaxial magnetars. If the bursts are narrowly collimated along open field lines, then observed repeating FRB may be those in which the moment of inertia tensor is only slightly triaxial and the rotation axis, open field lines and radiation point nearly to the observer. Apparently non-repeating FRB may be triaxial with the direction of open field lines and radiation wandering across the sky, reducing their duty factors by several orders of magnitude. A slightly triaxial moment tensor in repeaters moves the line of sight into or out of the radiation pattern or within it, explaining periods of greater or lesser (or absent) activity, and making the probability of detecting a burst vary aperiodically. The dynamics of triaxial bodies may also thwart the coherent integration of gravitational signals from fast-rotating accreting neutron stars.",

Raynaud, Matteo Bugli, Tito Dal Canton High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The nature of the remnant of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger is uncertain. Though certainly a black hole (BH) in the cases of the most massive BNSs, X-ray lightcurves from gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows suggest a neutron star (NS) as a viable candidate for both the merger remnant as well as the central engine of these transients. When jointly observed with gravitational waves (GWs), X-ray lightcurves from BNS merger events could provide critical constraints on the remnant's nature. We aim to assess the current and future capabilities to detect a NS remnant through X-ray observations following GW detections. To this end, we simulate GW signals from BNS mergers and the subsequent X-ray emission from newborn millisecond magnetars. The GW detectability is modeled for both current and next-generation interferometers, while the X-ray emission is reproduced using a dedicated numerical code that models magnetar spin-down and ejecta dynamics informed by numerical-relativity simulations. In our simulations, 2% - 16% of BNS mergers form millisecond magnetars. Among these, up to 70% could be detectable, amounting to up to 1 millisecond magnetar detection per year with SVOM/MXT-like instruments during the LIGO Virgo KAGRA LIGO India (LVKI) O5 run, with optimal detectability occurring about 2 hours post-merger. For next-generation GW interferometers, this rate could increase by up to three orders of magnitude, with peak detectability 3 to 4 hours post-merger. We also explore how the magnetar's magnetic field strength and observer viewing angle affect detectability and discuss optimized observational strategies. Although more likely with upcoming GW interferometers, detecting the spin-down emission of a millisecond magnetar may already be within reach, warranting sustained theoretical and observational efforts given the profound implications for mergers, GRBs, and NS physics of a single detection.",

Due to their complexity, RHD problems must usually be studied through numerical simulation. We have extended the publicly available RICH code, which previously solved the equations of RHD in the limit of grey flux-limited diffusion (FLD), to operate with a multigroup FLD solver. RICH is a semi-Lagrangian code that solves the equations of RHD on an unstructured moving mesh, and is the first multigroup RHD moving mesh code, making it uniquely applicable to problems with extreme dynamic range and dynamically important radiation forces. We validate our multigroup module against multiple analytic benchmarks, including a novel test of the RHD Doppler term. The computational efficiency of the code is aided by a novel scheme to accelerate convergence in optically thick cells. Finally, we apply multigroup RICH in a pilot study of a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE), using a $10^4 M_\\odot$ intermediate-mass black hole. Our simulations self-consistently produce a bright early-time X-ray flash prior to peak optical/UV light, in qualitative agreement with post-processing of (grey) RICH simulations of supermassive black hole TDEs, as well as X-ray observations of the TDE AT 2022dsb.",

The continuous TESS coverage allows us to characterise its frequent outbursts with unprecedented detail, providing the first comprehensive study of an AM CVn during outbursts and enabling detailed modelling of these systems. The superoutbursts in KL Dra generally include a precursor, and are followed by a series of rebrightenings after which a sequence of 3-4 large amplitude normal outbursts is observed. We fit parametric profiles to each superoutburst component (precursor, rise to plateau, plateau, decay), to rebrightenings, and to normal outbursts, which let us quantify every high state feature and investigate correlations with the system's long term supercyle evolution. Our continuous coverage reveals an average value for the supercycles, superoutbursts and normal outbursts of $60.4 \\pm 0.1$ d, $5.67\\pm0.03$ d and $1.17 \\pm0.01$ d, respectively. The supercycle duration may be correlated with the rebrightenings duration and superoutburst amplitude, and anticorrelated with the plateau length. Within a supercycle, normal outbursts grow in amplitude and duration, and the first normal outburst is usually highly asymmetric, while subsequent normal outbursts are more symmetric. We detected superhumps in TESS superoutbursts but not in the rebrightenings or normal outbursts. We interpret the results within the disk instability model, considering additional effects, such as changes in the donor mass transfer rate.",

Machine learning (ML) methods offer an efficient, probabilistic approach to classify them, which can be useful for making discoveries and conducting deeper studies. In earlier work, we applied the LightGBM (ML model) to classify 277,069 {\\em Chandra} point sources into eight categories: active galactic nuclei (AGN), X-ray emitting stars, young stellar objects (YSO), high-mass X-ray binaries, low-mass X-ray binaries, ultraluminous X-ray sources, cataclysmic variables, and pulsars. In this work, we present the classification table of 54,770 robustly classified sources (over $3\\sigma$ confidence), including 14,066 sources at $>4\\sigma$ significance. To ensure classification reliability and gain a deeper insight, we investigate the multiwavelength feature relationships learned by the LightGBM model, focusing on AGNs, Stars, and YSOs. We employ Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to quantify the contribution of individual features and their interactions to the predicted classification probabilities. Among other things, we find infrared-optical and X-ray decision boundaries for separating AGN/Stars, and infrared-X-ray boundaries for YSOs. These results are crucial for estimating object classes even with limited multiwavelength data. This study represents one of the earliest applications of XAI to large-scale astronomical datasets, demonstrating ML models' potential for uncovering physically meaningful patterns in data in addition to classification. Finally, our publicly available, extensive, and interactive catalogue will be helpful to explore the contributions of features and their combinations in greater detail in the future.",

However, a critical bottleneck remains: the ability to rapidly survey the sizable sky areas defined by the localization uncertainties of neutrino detectors and to provide rapid spectroscopic classification of the multitude of optical transients found within them. By deploying a large field-of-view with high-multiplex Multi-Object Spectroscopy (MOS) on a large aperture telescope, one can instantaneously cover neutrino error circles, thus providing crucial spectroscopic classifications of potential counterparts discovered, for example, by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (LSST) with unprecedented efficiency. Furthermore, simultaneous operation of a giant panoramic central Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) would allow for detailed kinematic and environmental characterization of primary candidates. This facility would unlock deep synergies between next-generation neutrino telescopes (IceCube-Gen2, KM3NeT) and gamma-ray observatories (CTAO), transforming unique multi-messenger alerts into a comprehensive physical understanding.",

Gudennavar, Prajwel Joseph 11 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in JHEAP Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Active galactic nuclei are known to exhibit flux variations across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Among these, correlations between UV/optical and X-ray flux variations serve as a key diagnostics for understanding the physical connection between the accretion disk and the corona. In this work, we present the results of analysis of ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray flux variations in the narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 1044. Simultaneous observations in the far-UV band (FUV: 1300$-$1800 Å) and the X-ray band (0.5$-$7 keV) obtained during 31 August $-$ 8 September 2018 with the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope and the Soft X-ray Telescope onboard \\textit{AstroSat} were used for this study. Significant flux variability was detected in both FUV and X-ray bands. The fractional root mean square variability amplitude ($F_{\\rm var}$) was found to be 0.036 $\\pm$ 0.001 in the FUV band and 0.384 $\\pm$ 0.004 in the X-ray band. To explore potential time lag between the two bands, cross-correlation analysis was performed using both the interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF) and just another vehicle for estimating lags in nuclei (JAVELIN) methods. Results from both approaches are consistent within 2$\\sigma$ uncertainty, indicating that X-ray variations lead the FUV variations, with measured lags of 2.25$\\pm$0.05 days (ICCF) and $2.35_{-0.01}^{+0.02}$ days (JAVELIN). This is the first detection of a time delay between UV and X-ray variations in Mrk 1044. The observed UV lag supports the disk reprocessing scenario, wherein X-ray emission from the corona irradiates the accretion disk, driving the observed UV variability.",

Although jets extract their energy from the black hole (BH) rotation, their effect on the BH spin is poorly understood. Because the spin controls radiative and mechanical BH feedback, lack of first-principles models for spin evolution limits our ability to interpret observations, including the recent LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA spin constraints. Particularly important are luminous disks, which rapidly grow and strongly torque their BHs. Jetless and weakly magnetized standard luminous disks spin up their BHs to near-maximum spin, $a_{eq,NT}=0.998$. However, sufficient large-scale vertical magnetic flux can cause the inner disk to enter a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state, whose jets can efficiently extract BH rotational energy and significantly spin down the BH. Lowell et al. (2024) found that nonradiative, thick MADs spin down their BHs to very low $a_{eq,MAD}^{thick}=0.07$. Their analytic model predicted that luminous, thin MADs also spin down their BHs to low $a_{eq,MAD}^{thin}\\sim0.3\\text{-}0.5$. To test this prediction, we perform 3D general relativistic (radiation) magnetohydrodynamic (GR(R)MHD) simulations of MADs across a wide range of BH spin ($-0.9\\le{}a\\le0.99$) and disk thickness ($0.03\\le{}h/r\\le0.3$, which corresponds to Eddington ratio, $0.35\\le{}\\dot{m}/\\dot{m}_{Edd}\\le\\infty$). We find that luminous, thin MADs ($0.03\\le{}h/r\\le0.1$) efficiently spin down their BHs to a low universal equilibrium spin value, $a_{eq,MAD}^{thin}\\approx0.3$: a maximally spinning BH ($a=1$) spins down to $a=0.5$ after accreting just $25\\%$ of its initial mass. Our results follow quadratic convergence, $a_{eq,MAD}^{fit}\\simeq0.3-2.7(h/r)^2\\to0.3$ as $h/r\\to0$, which we attribute to the aggressive cooling that renders disk thermodynamics irrelevant and magnetic forces insensitive to thermal $h/r$.",

In addition, the paper structure needs to be revised to better present the logical flow and support the conclusions High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The recent IceCube detection of TeV neutrinos from some nearby Seyfert galaxy (e.g., NGC~1068) suggests that active galactic nuclei (AGN) could make a significant contribution to the diffuse flux of astrophysical neutrinos. The absence of TeV gamma-rays from NGC~1068 indicates neutrino production in compact gamma-ray-opaque region. The vicinity of the supermassive black hole, such as disk-corona, is an ideal region, where the high radiation density leads to efficient neutrino production as well as the gamma-ray attenuation. Disk-corona models predict that the neutrino emission from AGNs correlates with X-ray emission, which traces the coronal activity. In this paper, we assess whether the X-ray AGN population origin for TeV neutrinos can be tested by using the spatial correlation between the neutrino population and X-ray AGN population with future neutrino telescopes. By performing simulations, we find that, the AGN origin of the neutrino background above 100\\,TeV can be tested at a confidence level of $\\sim2.4\\sigma$ with five-year observations of IceCube-Gen2, which has an angular resolution of $\\sim0.2$ degree. With better angular resolution and sensitivity in the energy range of above $300$\\,TeV, a 30-${\\rm km^3}$ underwater neutrino telescope, such as High-energy Underwater Neutrino Telescope (HUNT), is expected to reach a significance of $\\sim8.6\\sigma$ in testing the association after five years of exposure.",

We study a series of response models to investigate the formation of specific morphological features in the central 1 kpc region of the gas component in barred spiral galaxies. Aims. We aim to understand how structures, such as nuclear rings and spirals, form by varying the parameters of a general gravitational potential and gas properties. Our goal is to determine how much the shape of these structures is driven by the orbital dynamics of the models compared to the influence of the hydrodynamics of the gas. In particular, we examine the effects of the bar strength, bar shape, pattern speed, and central density, as well as their mutual interdependence. Methods. We modeled the gas flow using hydrodynamical simulations run with the Eulerian RAMSES code. The underlying gravitational potential was a two-dimensional Ferrers bar and the gas was considered to be isothermal. Alongside analyzing the gas response to the imposed gravitational potentials, we carried out orbital studies for all models. This involved assessing the shapes and stability of periodic orbits and analyzing the distribution of regular versus chaotic regions within the systems. Results. The parameters of the gravitational potential alone are insufficient to accurately predict the gas dynamics in a system. The morphology of the gaseous response varies substantially with changes in sound speed, emphasizing the fundamental role of hydrodynamic processes in determining the structure of the gas within the central region. We identify the factors that affect the morphology of nuclear rings and trailing and leading nuclear spirals. The best alignment between our models and structures observed in local barred galaxies is achieved by assuming a sound speed of $c_s=20\\,\\rm{km\\,s^{-1}}$.",

Athanassoula 24 pages, 17 figures, published in Universe (MDPI) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We study the flow of gas in a barred-galaxy model, in which a considerable part of the underlying stable periodic orbits have loops where, close to the ends of the bar, several orbital families coexist and chaos dominates. Such conditions are typically encountered in a zone between the 4:1 resonance and corotation. The purpose of our study is to understand the gaseous flow in the aforementioned environment and trace the morphology of the shocks that form. We use two conceptually different hydrodynamic schemes for our calculations, namely, the mesh-free Lagrangian SPH method and the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES. This allows us to compare responses by means of the two algorithms. We find that the big loops of the orbits, mainly belonging to the x1 stable periodic orbits, do not help the shock loci to approach corotation. They deviate away from the regions occupied by the loops, bypass them and form extensions at an angle with the straight-line shocks. Roughly at the distance from the center at which we start to observe the big loops, we find characteristic \"tails\" of dense gas streaming towards the straight-line shocks. The two codes give complementary information for understanding the hydrodynamics of the models.",

GN-z11 at z=10.6 is one of these galaxies. One possible scenario for such a high N/O ratio is pollution from supermassive stars (SMSs), from which stellar winds are expected to be nitrogen-rich. The abundance pattern is determined by both galaxy evolution and SMS pollution, but so far, simple one-zone models have been used. Using a galaxy formation simulation, we tested the SMS scenario. We used a cosmological zoom-in simulation that includes chemical evolution driven by rotating massive stars (Wolf-Rayet stars), supernovae, and asymptotic giant branch stars. As a post-process, we assumed the formation of an SMS with a mass between $10^3$ and $10^5$ $M_\\odot$ and investigated the contribution of its ejecta to the abundance pattern. The N/O ratio was enhanced by the SMS ejecta, and the abundance pattern of GN-z11, including carbon-to-oxygen and oxygen-to-hydrogen ratios, was reproduced by our SMS pollution model if the pollution mass fraction ranges within 10-30 per cent. Such a pollution fraction can be realized when the gas ionized by the SMS is polluted, and the gas density is $10^4$-$10^5$ cm$^{-3}$ assuming a Strömgren sphere. We also compared the abundance pattern with those of other N/O-enhanced high-$z$ galaxies. Some of these galaxies can also be explained by SMS pollution.",

Their optical spectra can be identified by strong emission-line signatures (broad and/or narrow lines). Those showing only narrow lines are classified as 'Type 2' AGN.

We address this by presenting a new catalogue of Type 2 AGN from the 6dF Galaxy Survey (6dFGS), which has 136,304 spectra covering roughly 17{,}000~\\mathrm{deg}^2, mainly of low-redshift galaxies. We use a median absolute deviation cut on the continuum-fitted spectrum to select emission line galaxies. AGN were identified by fitting the 6dFGS spectra with a modified Python QSO fitting tool (PyQSOFit). All selected spectra were visually inspected and corrected for fitting errors where necessary. 10,492 narrow emission line galaxies were identified in 6dFGS, including 5000 Type 2 AGN classified from Baldwin--Phillips--Terlevich (BPT) diagram.

Angulo, the J-PLUS Collaboration 19 pages, 8 figures, submitted to the special issue \"Connecting Planetary Nebulae with Their Host Galaxy Stellar Population Properties'' of Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Sciences journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) In this pilot study, we investigate the PN population in M~33, a nearby spiral galaxy ($\\simeq 840$~kpc), using data from the DR3 of the Javalambre-Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS), a 12-band photometric dataset extensively used to identify H$\\alpha$ line emitters. From the 143 known PNe of M~33, the photometry of only 13 are present in the J-PLUS catalog, as available on the J-PLUS portal. With the aim of recovering a larger fraction of the M~33 PN population, the software SExtractor is adopted to extract the sources in the J-PLUS images and obtain the photometric data for the PNe known in the literature, performing PSF photometry when possible. With this procedure the photometry of 98 PNe was obtained using H$\\alpha$ image as detection image, including the 13 already present in the J-PLUS catalog. Using diagnostic color-color diagrams (DCCDs) based on criteria developed for Milky Way halo PNe, we identified 16 sources with PN-like colors. Cross-match with existing catalogs revealed that most of these candidates are H II regions, though one source remains unidentified. Additionally, analyzing their full width at half maximum, most of them would not be PN candidates. This highlights the method's ability to select emission-line objects but also underscores the challenge of distinguishing PNe from contaminants using photometry alone. The J-PLUS colors of 98 known PNe were analyzed, together with literature information on their radial velocities, resulting in the identification of one possible halo PN. This is the first paper which aims at detecting extragalactic PNe in multi-band surveys such as J-PLUS, the Southern Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) and the Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS), paving the way for similar studies in these surveys for other nearby galaxies, which lack catalogs of known PNe.",

However, the current number of dual AGNs remains scarce. In this work, we selected 173 new dual AGNs, 4 AGN triplets, and 1 AGN quadruplet from the Million Quasars Catalog, all with low redshift ($z < 0.5$), a projected distance ($r_p$) of no more than 100 kpc, and a line-of-sight velocity difference ($|\\Delta v|$) of less than 600 km s$^{-1}$, thus supplementing existing low-redshift dual AGNs demographics. Visual inspection of the optical images from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Survey was performed for each pair, revealing that $\\sim$16\\% of pairs exhibit tidal features. Statistical analyses show an increasing number of dual AGNs with decreasing redshift, with velocity difference primarily at $|\\Delta v| < $ 300 km s$^{-1}$, which is likely an artifact of our selection strategy. The tidal sample peaks as having 13 pairs at 5-20$h^{-1}_{70}$ kpc, but drops to 1 pair $> 55\\,h^{-1}_{70}$ kpc. Our study also explores thewide separation ($r_p>10$ kpc) dual AGNs, finding 165 such systems, with 25 displaying clear tidal features. Furthermore, some extra galaxies, AGNs, and/or their candidates were found in the same regions of the pairs or multiplets forming interacting systems with these pairs or multiplets.",

This applies in particular when the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) becomes operable in 2027, which is expected to close an important gap in our understanding of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and other areas of astrophysics. To this end, foreground objects, contaminants of the 21-cm signal, need to be identified and subtracted. Source finding and identification is thus an important albeit challenging task. We investigate the ability of AI and deep learning (DL) methods that have been previously trained on other data domains to localize and classify radio galaxies with minimal changes to their architectures. Various well-known pretrained neural network architectures for image classification and object detection are trained and fine-tuned and their performance is evaluated on a public radio galaxy dataset derived from the Radio Galaxy Zoo. A comparison between convolutional neural network (CNN)- and transformer-based algorithms is performed. The best performing architecture is systematically optimized and an uncertainty estimation is performed by means of an ensemble analysis. Radio source classification performance nearly comparable to the current leading customized models can be obtained using existing standard pretrained DL architectures, without modification and increase in complexity of the model architectures but rather adaptation of the data, by combining various transformations on replicated image channels. Using an ensemble of models can also further improve performance to over 90% accuracy, on par with top-performing models in the literature. The results can be transferred to other survey data, e.g. from the Murchison Wide-field Array (MWA), and in the future be used to study the EoR with the SKAO.",

Revised in response to a positive referee report with only minor comments Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) To investigate the formation and evolution of vertical structures in disk galaxies, we measure global $\\operatorname{sech}^2$ scale heights, averaging thin and thick components when present, for 2631 edge-on disk galaxies with $M_*>10^{10} M_\\odot$ at $0< z < 3.5$ from the JWST COSMOS-Web survey. We show that dust extinction systematically overestimates scale heights at shorter rest-frame wavelengths, and therefore adopt a fixed rest-frame wavelength of 1 $\\mu$m. After further correcting for projection-induced bias using a new accurate method, we find that the median disk scale height increases from $0.56\\pm0.03$ kpc at $z=3.25$ to $0.84\\pm0.04$ kpc at $z=1.25$, and subsequently decreases to $0.67\\pm0.06$ kpc at $z=0.25$. The disk length-to-height ratio remains constant at $2.7\\pm0.2$ for $z>1.5$, but rises to $4.0\\pm0.4$ at $z=0.25$. These results imply that the high-redshift progenitors of present-day thick disks were of intermediate thickness, neither thin nor thick, yet dynamically hot and dense. The observed radial variation of scale height is consistent with the artificial flaring expected from observational effects, disfavoring minor mergers as the primary mechanism of disk thickening. Instead, we suggest that the high-redshift intermediate-thickness disks were single-component systems that increased their vertical scale height through decreasing surface mass density and/or violent gravitational instabilities, eventually producing thick disks. Thin-disk growth begins at $z\\approx2$ and dominates at $z\\lesssim1$, yielding a vertically more compact system with decreasing scale heights from $z\\approx1$ to $0$. The inferred thin-disk mass fraction increases from $0.1\\pm0.03$ at $z=1$ to $0.6\\pm0.1$ at $z=0$. Together, these findings reveal a continuous evolutionary link between high-redshift single-component disks and present-day thick thin disk systems.",

Mills Accepted for publication in A&A. 13 pages, 9 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The central molecular zone (CMZ), surrounding the Galactic centre, is the largest reservoir of dense molecular gas in the Galaxy. Despite its relative proximity, the 3D structure of the CMZ remains poorly constrained, primarily due to projection effects. We aim to constrain the line-of-sight location of two molecular clouds in the CMZ -the 50 and 20 km/s clouds- and to investigate their possible physical connection using stellar kinematics and photometry. This study serves as a pilot for future applications across the full CMZ. We estimated the line-of-sight position of the clouds by analysing stellar kinematics, stellar densities, and stellar populations towards the cloud regions and a control field. We find an absence of westward moving stars in the cloud regions, which indicates that they lie on the near side of the CMZ. This interpretation is supported by the stellar density distributions. The similar behaviour observed in the two clouds, as well as in the region between them (the ridge), suggests that they are located at comparable distances and are physically linked. We also identified an intermediate-age stellar population (2-7 Gyr) in both regions, consistent with that observed on the near side of the CMZ. We estimated the line-of-sight distances at which the clouds and the ridge become kinematically detectable (i.e. where the proper motion component parallel to the Galactic plane differs from that of the control field at the 3 sigma level) by converting their measured proper motions parallel to the Galactic plane using a theoretical model of the stellar distribution. We find that the 50 and 20 km/s clouds are located at $43\\pm8$ pc and $56\\pm11$ pc from Sgr A*, respectively, and that the ridge lies at $56\\pm11$ pc; this supports the idea that the clouds are physically connected through the ridge.",

In this study we employed the IllustrisTNG50-1 simulation to demonstrate that knowledge of the turbulence in the cosmic baryonic fluid is crucial for correctly understanding both the spatial distribution and the physical origins of the missing baryons in the Universe. First, we find that dynamical effects cause the gas to be detained in low-density and intermediate-density regions, resulting in high baryon fractions, and prevent the convergence of the gas in high-density regions, leading to low baryon fractions. Second, turbulent energy is converted into thermal energy, and the injection and dissipation of turbulent energy have essentially reached a balance from $z=1$ to $0$. This indicates that the cosmic fluid is in a steady state within this redshift range. Due to turbulent heating, as the redshift decreases, an increasing amount of warm gas is heated and converted into the WHIM, and some even into hot gas. We find that, compared with turbulence in the cosmic fluid, shocks are unimportant in intermediate-density regions and even negligible in high-density regions, both dynamically and thermodynamically. This finding accounts for the origin of the WHIM in terms of both dynamics and thermodynamics, calls into question the traditional view of shock-heating, and highlights the importance of turbulence in shaping the large-scale structure of the Universe, particularly in the evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters. In addition to TNG50-1, we validated our key findings with TNG50-2, TNG100-1, WIGEON, and EAGLE simulations, demonstrating that the spatial resolution, box size, and sub-grid-physics variations do not affect our main conclusions.",

However, the universality of PL relations is still debated; particularly, the metallicity effect on the Cepheid PL relation. Due to the HIF-stellar photosphere interactions in Cepheids, different period-color (PC) relations at different phases can influence the corresponding PL relations at those this http URL have considered the PL relations at multiple pulsation phases as they capture the ensemble radiation hydrodynamic properties at those phases. We investigate the effect of metallicity on PL relations based on multiphase analysis of classical Cepheid light curves in the MW, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Multiphase metallicity coefficients $(\\gamma)$ are derived in five different photometric bands ($V$, $I$, $G$, $G_{\\rm BP}$, $G_{\\rm RP}$) and two Wesenheit indices ($W_{VI}$, $W_{G}$). We show that the coefficients of multiphase period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relations vary dynamically as functions of Cepheid pulsation phases over a complete pulsation cycle. We find significant differences in the $\\gamma_{\\lambda}$ values between the short- $(0.4 \\leq \\log{P} < 1)$ and long-period $(1 \\leq \\log{P} < 2)$ Cepheids at multiple phases, in two bands, $G_{\\rm RP}$ and $W_{G}$. The weighted averages of the multiphase $\\gamma_{\\lambda}$ values are found to be in good agreement with the latest results published in the literature. Our methods and results provide new insights into the metallicity effect on the Leavitt law, which can be useful in constraining pulsation models. Additionally, this study shows that the metallicity effect on mean-light PL relations can be recovered from its phase-dependent nature found in this study.",

Rev. D 113, 023010 - Published 7 January, 2026 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a framework for dark matter (DM) halo formation based on a kinetic theory of self-gravitating fermions together with a solid connection to thermodynamics. Based on maximum entropy arguments, this approach predicts a most likely phase-space distribution which takes into account the Pauli exclusion principle, relativistic effects, and particle evaporation. The most general equilibrium configurations depend on the particle mass and develop a degenerate compact core embedded in a diluted halo, both linked by their fermionic nature. By applying such a theory to the Milky Way we analyze the stability of different families of equilibrium solutions with implications on the DM distribution and the mass of the DM candidate. We find that stable core-halo profiles, which explain the DM distribution in the Galaxy, exist only in the range $mc^2 \\approx 194 - 387\\,\\rm{keV}$. The lower bound is a consequence of imposing thermodynamical stability on the core-halo solutions having a $4.2\\times 10^6 M_\\odot$ quantum core mass alternative to the black hole hypothesis at the Galaxy center. The upper bound is solely an outcome of general relativity when the quantum core reaches the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit and undergoes gravitational collapse towards a black hole. We demonstrate that there exists a set of stable core-halo profiles which are astrophysically relevant in the sense that their total mass is finite, do not suffer from the gravothermal catastrophe, and agree with observations. The morphology of the outer halo tail is described by a polytrope of index $5/2$, developing a sharp decline of the density beyond $25\\,\\rm{kpc}$ in excellent agreement with the latest Gaia DR3 rotation curve data. Moreover, we obtain a total mass of about $2\\times 10^{11} M_\\odot$ including baryons and a local DM density of about $0.4\\,\\rm{GeV}\\,c^{-2}\\,\\rm{cm}^{-3}$ in line with recent independent estimates.",

Published in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The well-known discrepancy in galactic rotation curves refers to the mismatch between observed rotational velocities and the velocities predicted by baryonic matter. In this study we investigate a potential pattern in the discrepancy, which may point to an underlying pattern in dark-halo distributions. By looking at rotational-velocity curves from an alternate perspective, the angular-velocity curves, it appears that the observed angular velocities and their corresponding baryonic predictions differ by a constant shift. That is, the discrepancy may be reduced to a constant angular-velocity term, independent of the radius. We test the generality of the suggested property by analysing 143 high-quality rotation curves. The property appears significant as it performs equally well (or better) than well-established dark-halo models. Compared to a Burkert profile, it is preferred in 60% of the cases, while relative to a Navarro Frenk White profile (NFW), it is superior in 73% of the cases. Next, by including the new phenomenological property within the dynamical equations, we find an explicit expression for the dark-halo profile. The new single-parameter profile is characterised by a remarkable property: it is intrinsically related to the baryonic distribution. Thus, information regarding the cuspy or cored nature of a particular dark halo, according to this profile, is encoded (and explicitly determined) by the respective baryonic behaviour.",

Trayford, Joop Schaye, Camila Correa, Sylvia Ploeckinger, Alexander J. Richings, Evgenii Chaikin, Matthieu Schaller, Alejandro Benitez-Llambay, Carlos Frenk, Filip Husko 29 pages, 16 figures, Published in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) While marginal in mass terms, dust grains play an outsized role in both the physics and observation of the interstellar medium (ISM). However, explicit modelling of this ISM constituent remains uncommon in large cosmological simulations. In this work, we present a model for the life-cycle of dust in the ISM that couples to the forthcoming COLIBRE galaxy formation model, which explicitly simulates the cold ISM. We follow 6 distinct grain types: 3 chemical species, including carbon and two silicate grains, with 2 size bins each. Our dust model accounts for seeding of grains from stellar ejecta, self-consistent element-by-element metal yields and growth by accretion, grain size transfer (shattering and coagulation) and destruction of dust by thermal sputtering in the ISM. We detail the calibration of this model, particularly the use of a clumping factor, to account for unresolved gas clouds in which dust readily evolves. We present a fiducial run in a 25$^3$~cMpc$^3$ cosmological volume that displays good agreement with observations of the cosmic evolution of dust density, as well as the $z=0$ galaxy dust mass function and dust scaling relations. We highlight known tensions between observational datasets of the dust-to-gas ratio as a function of metallicity depending on which metallicity calibrator is used; our model favours higher-normalisation metallicity calibrators, which agree with the observations within 0.1~dex for stellar masses $>10^9 \\; {\\rm M_\\odot}$. We compare the grain size distribution to observations of local galaxies, and find that our simulation suggests a higher concentration of small grains, associated with more diffuse ISM and the warm-neutral medium (WNM), which both play a key role in boosting H$_2$ content. Putting these results and modelling approaches in context, we set the stage for upcoming insights into the dusty ISM of galaxies using the COLIBRE simulations.",

Composite attenuation curves, stacked by stellar mass and inclination, reveal systematic trends: a higher stellar mass correlates with steeper slopes (lower $R_V$), while edge-on galaxies exhibit flatter curves due to geometric saturation effects. This flattening occurs because, as optical depth increases along the line of sight, the observed light becomes increasingly dominated by emission from the outer, less obscured layers of the galaxy. Using a simplified radiative transfer treatment based on a uniform dust-star mixture, we find the inclination-dependent slope variations are consistent with geometric effects, whereas the mass-dependent slope steepening indicates evolution in intrinsic dust properties, suggesting feedback-driven grain fragmentation in massive galaxies. Additionally, intermediate-scale structures (ISSs) are tentatively identified in the attenuation curves at approximately 4870, 6370, and 7690 Å. These results illustrate how the interplay among dust-star geometry, grain size evolution, and the galactic environment shapes attenuation curves.",

Mann, Vivienne Wild Accepted for publication in MNRAS. Comments welcome. 15 pages, 8 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Galaxy mergers and interactions have long been suggested as a significant driver of galaxy evolution. However, the exact extent to which mergers enhance star formation and AGN activity has been challenging to establish observationally. In previous work, we visually classified a sample of galaxies with various types of faint tidal features in DECaLS images. In this paper, we cross-correlate this sample with SDSS-derived data to investigate how the presence and specific nature of these features correlates with intense star formation and AGN activity. Averaged over all tidal classes, we find that our 688 tidal feature galaxies are 6.6$\\pm$0.9 times more likely to be in a starburst phase and 19.6$\\pm$5.0 times more likely to have rapidly quenched (post-starbursts) than a sample of 4073 controls matched in both stellar mass and redshift. Examining differences between tidal classes, galaxies with \\textit{arm} features were $\\sim$1.3-4.0 times more likely to be starbursting than the other categories, while those with \\textit{shell} features were $\\sim$2.3-5.3 times more likely to be in a quiescent state. In a similar analysis, we identify which galaxies show evidence of AGN activity (from a sample of $\\sim$2100) and find no significant difference between those with or without tidal features. Overall, our results reinforce the notion that mergers play an important role in driving star formation and rapid quenching in galaxies, and provide some of the first empirical evidence that the strength of this effect has a dependence on the detailed nature of the interaction, as traced by the tidal feature morphology.",

Moscardini Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Star clusters are valuable indicators of galaxy evolution, offering insights into the buildup of stellar populations across cosmic time. Understanding intrinsic star cluster populations of dwarf galaxies is particularly important given their role in the hierarchical growth of larger systems. Using Euclid Early Release Observation data, we study star clusters in two star-forming dwarf irregulars in the Local Group, NGC 6822 and IC 10 [$M_\\star \\sim$ (1--4) $\\times10^8 M_\\odot$]. With Euclid, clusters are resolved into individual stars across the main bodies and haloes of both galaxies. Visual inspection of $I_E$ images uncovers 30 new cluster candidates in NGC 6822 and 16 in IC 10, from compact to extended clusters. We re-evaluate literature candidates, producing combined catalogues of 52 (NGC 6822) and 71 (IC 10) clusters with confidence-based classifications. We present homogeneous photometry in $I_E$, $Y_E$, $J_E$, $H_E$, and archival UBVRI data, alongside size measurements and properties from BAGPIPES SED fitting. Synthetic cluster injection shows our sample is $\\sim 50$% complete to $M \\lesssim 10^3 M_\\odot$ for ages $\\lesssim 100$ Myr, and to $M \\lesssim 3\\times10^4 M_\\odot$ for $\\sim 10$ Gyr. IC 10 has more young clusters than NGC 6822, extending to higher masses, consistent with its starburst nature. Both dwarfs host several old massive ($\\gtrsim 10^5 M_\\odot$) clusters, including an exceptional $1.3 \\times 10^6 M_\\odot$ cluster in NGC 6822's outskirts. In NGC 6822, we identify a previously undetected, old, extended cluster ($R_h = 12.4 \\pm 0.11$ pc). Using well-defined criteria, we identify 11 candidate GCs in NGC 6822 and eight in IC 10. Both galaxies have high specific frequencies ($S_N$) but remain consistent with known GC scaling relations at low luminosity [abridged].",

Recent work has established that they follow a tight relation between their internal stellar velocity dispersion $\\sigma$ and luminosity, enabling accurate distance measurements. In this work, we aim to apply this GC velocity dispersion (GCVD) distance method to measure the distance to M104 (NGC 4594, the Sombrero galaxy). We have measured internal stellar velocity dispersions for 85 globular clusters (GCs) and one ultra-compact dwarf galaxy around M104 using high-resolution multi-object integrated-light spectroscopy with FLAMES/GIRAFFE on the Very Large Telescope. The measured velocity dispersions range from $\\sigma = 4 - 30$ km s$^{-1}$, with a mean uncertainty of $\\Delta\\sigma = 2.5$ km s$^{-1}$. For a subset of 77 GCs with $V$-band magnitudes and reliable velocity dispersion measurements above $\\sigma > 4$ km s$^{-1}$, we constructed the $M_V$-$\\sigma$ relation to measure the distance to M104, finding $D=9.00\\pm0.29$ (stat.)~$\\pm0.26$ (sys.) Mpc. The GCs follow the Milky Way and M31 $M_V-\\sigma$ relation closely, with the exception of the luminous ultra-compact dwarf SUCD1, which is nearly one magnitude brighter than the mean relation. 29 GCs in the sample have sizes determined from Hubble Space Telescope imaging which allowed us to determine their masses and $V$-band dynamical mass-to-light ratios (M/L$_V$). We find a mean $<M/L_V> = 2.6 M_{\\odot}/L_{\\odot}$ for the luminous ($M_V < -8$ mag) M 104 GCs, which is higher than the Milky Way GCs, but is reminiscent of the brightest GCs in Centaurus A. With the exception of SUCD1, the GCs of M104 follow the GCVD relation irrespective of their mass-to-light ratio.",

Bakx, Toshihiro Kawaguchi, Kianhong Lee, Naoki Matsumoto, Bovornpratch Vijarnwannaluk 21 pages, 10 figures, accepted by ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) One of the most remarkable discoveries of JWST is a population of compact, red sources at z > 4, commonly referred to as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Spectroscopic identifications reported that most LRDs are active galactic nuclei (AGNs), which are preferentially found around z ~ 6 and could imply a key phase in the formation and growth of black holes (BHs) in the early universe. Photometric surveys at lower redshift have recently been carried out to trace their evolution across cosmic time, and a small number of LRD-like galaxies have been spectroscopically identified at both Cosmic Noon and in the local universe. Here we report the discovery of one of the lowest-z LRD-like galaxies, J204837.26-002437.2 (hereafter J2048) at z = 0.4330, using new Gemini-N/GMOS IFU observations combined with archival multi-band photometric SED data. The GMOS data reveal extended blue emission from starburst with a star formation rate of 400 solar mass per year, together with an extended, highly fast ionized outflow. This is the first spectroscopic confirmation of extended host emission and outflow in an LRD-like galaxy, providing a unique laboratory for understanding the nature of their high-redshift counterparts. Moreover, J2048 would host an extremely overmassive BH with a BH-to-stellar mass ratio of ~ 60%, with the BH mass and host stellar mass estimated to be 10^10.2 and 10^10.4 solar masses, respectively. We discuss the origin and evolutionary fate of J2048, and the implications that such low-z analogs have for interpreting the properties of high-z LRDs.",

Figure 7 shows the key measurements and Fig 8 model inference. Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Galaxies exhibit a tight correlation between their star-formation rate and stellar mass over a wide redshift range known as the star-forming main sequence (SFMS). With JWST, we can now investigate the SFMS at high redshifts down to masses of $\\sim10^6$ M$_{\\odot}$, using sensitive star-formation rate tracers such as H$\\alpha$ emission -- which allow us to probe the variability in star formation histories. We present inferences of the SFMS based on 316 H$\\alpha$-selected galaxies at $z\\sim4$-$5$ with $\\log(\\rm M_\\star/M_\\odot) = 6.4$ -$10.6$. These galaxies were identified behind the Abell 2744 lensing cluster with NIRCam grism spectroscopy from the ``All the Little Things'' (ALT) survey. At face value, our data suggest a shallow slope of the SFMS (SFR $\\propto \\mathrm{M}_\\star^\\alpha$, with $\\alpha=0.45$). After correcting for the H$\\alpha$-flux limited nature of our survey using a Bayesian framework, the slope steepens to $\\alpha = 0.59^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, whereas current data on their own are inconclusive on the mass dependence of the scatter. These slopes differ significantly from the slope of $\\approx1$ expected from the observed evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and from simulations. When fixing the slope to $\\alpha=1$, we find evidence for a decreasing intrinsic scatter with stellar mass (from $\\approx 0.5$ dex at M$_\\star=10^8$ M$_\\odot$ to $0.4$ dex at M$_\\star=10^{10}$ M$_\\odot$). This tension might be explained by a (combination of) luminosity-dependent SFR(H$\\alpha$) calibration, a population of (mini)-quenched low-mass galaxies, or underestimated dust attenuation in high-mass galaxies. Future deep observations across facilities can quantify these processes, enabling better insights into the variability of star formation histories.",

      "abstract": "Polarization of decayless kink oscillations in a 3D MHD coronal loop model Sudip Mandal, Cosima Breu, Hardi Peter Accepted for publications in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Decayless kink oscillations are frequently observed in solar coronal loops and are considered potential contributors to coronal heating. Despite the ubiquity of this wave phenomenon, its driving mechanism remains unclear. Studies to derive the polarization state of these oscillations, which would be a key to identifying the drivers, have been limited due to observational constraints. We analyze a 3D MHD simulation of coronal loops using the MURaM code. Synthetic extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission maps, combined with velocity diagnostics, are used to identify and characterize transverse wave motions in the simulated loop structures. This is the first demonstration of decayless kink waves emerging self-consistently in a 3D MHD loop-in-a-box model. The simulation produces persistent, low-amplitude, decayless kink oscillations that closely match observed properties. These oscillations arise spontaneously, without any imposed periodic driver, and exhibit clear linear polarization with oscillation planes not aligned to the principal axes. The observed coherency of linear polarization with oscillation cycles favors a self-sustained or quasi-steady type wave driver over a stochastic or broadband source.",

      "abstract": "Empirical Evidence of Planetary Group Configurations Modulating Solar Activity Jeff A Hansen, Shaun David Brocus Fell Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Our prior research found that a $90^{\\circ}$ configuration of two planetary groups were temporally associated with significant changes in global electromagnetic standing waves (Schumann resonances) during and after the three $90^{\\circ}$ configuration events occurring in late 2017 and early 2018. Specifically noted were reductions in variability moving into an event and level changes immediately after a event. Because global standing-wave data have a short history and no $90^{\\circ}$ events have occurred since that period, we examine here whether these geometric configuration events correspond to similar signatures in the long sunspot count record. Using daily sunspot data from January 1935 through December 2024, we conducted empirical studies assessing variance changes, post-event level shifts, and potential intrinsic oscillatory structure. In Study A, a variance-ratio test showed that sunspot variability was systematically lower during the events than in the preceding period, with 21 of 26 events since 1935 exhibiting reduced variance (binomial $p=0.0025$). In Study B, solar activity level declined roughly 21 days after events ended, with 21 of 26 events showing negative changes (binomial $p=0.0025$). In Study C, wavelet and filtering analyses revealed no internal solar oscillations at comparable timescales. These findings provide empirical evidence that the configuration events are associated with shifts in solar activity. The next three configuration events in mid- and late-2026 offer an opportunity to assess these patterns in real time.",

Only the abundance pattern of V457 Cyg suggests depletion. In the spectrum of this star, TiO lines are also observed in emission in addition to metal emissions. V457 Cyg is likely a binary system that was once surrounded by a circumbinary disc. In the spectrum of V894 Per, we find a set of spectral lines that appear to belong to another star, corroborating that it is an eclipsing variable rather than an RV Tauri star.

Kovács, Róbert Szabó, János Nuspl Accepted in Astronomy and Astrophysics, 5 pages and 3 pages of appendix Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Context. Turbulent convection models in nonlinear radial stellar pulsation models rely on an extra equation for turbulent kinetic energy and fail to adequately explain mode-selection problems. Since multidimensional calculations are computationally expensive, it is reasonable to search for generalizations of physically grounded 1D models that approximate multidimensional results with sufficient accuracy, at least in a given parameter range. A natural way of progressing from one-equation models is to use additional nonlocal equations. While these types of models also exist in the literature, they have not been adopted for this type of object. Aims. We aim to adapt the three-equation turbulent convection model from Kuhfuss to radial stellar pulsation modeling. Methods. We use a Reynolds-stress one-point closure approach to derive our extensions alongside the model, while using additional models from the literature to close the anisotropy and dissipation terms. Results. We provide five extensions to the original model. These include an enhanced dissipation correction to the mixing length, a local anisotropy model replacing eddy viscosity, a second-order correction for turbulent ion transport in the atmosphere (alongside opacity effects), and turbulent damping of entropy fluctuations and convective flux.",

However, standard ionisation vectors such as stellar UV, X-rays, Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) might not be efficient enough, as UV/X-rays are attenuated rapidly with depth, while GCRs are modulated. Turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection in disc atmospheric layers offers a physically motivated, in-situ source of energetic particles (EPs) that has never been considered. We quantify the ionisation and heating produced by EPs accelerated by turbulent reconnection, identify where they dominate over X-rays and GCRs, and determine energetic thresholds for their relevance. We provide scalable diagnostics tied to the local energy budget. We adopt a Fermi-like acceleration model with parameters linked to a turbulent reconnection geometry trigger by the magneto-rotational instability, yielding a steady-state energy distribution of the EP forming a power-law of index $p=2.5$. We propagate electrons and protons through the disc and compute primary and secondary ionisation and associated heating on a fiducial T Tauri disc model background. The non-thermal normalisation is set by the fraction of local viscous accretion energy dissipation channelled to EPs, parametrised by $\\kappa$. For $\\kappa\\gtrsim 0.4\\%$, EPs ionisation overpass standard sources like X-rays and GCRs in the disc atmosphere and intermediate/deep layers out to radii of a few tens of AU. Even at $\\kappa\\sim 0.025\\%$, EPs contribute at the few-percent level, thus are chemically and dynamically relevant. EP-induced heating complements UV/X-ray heating in the atmosphere and persists deeper. These results identify EPs accelerated by turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection as a rather robust, disc-internal ionisation channel that should be included in thermo-chemical and dynamical models of protoplanetary discs.",

Wagner, Lisa Upton, Bibhuti Kumar Jha, Kiran Jain, Sara Petty Accepted for publication in Space Weather Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) A demonstrated failure mode for operational solar flare forecasting is the inability to forecast flares that occur near, or just beyond, the solar limb. To address this shortcoming, we develop a \"4pi\" full-heliosphere event forecasting framework and evaluate its statistical classification ability against this specific challenge. A magnetic surface flux transport model is used to generate full-sun maps of the photospheric radial magnetic field from which active regions (ARs) are identified and tracked using a new labeling scheme that is observer-location agnostic and allows for post-facto modifications. Flare-relevant magnetic parameters couple to a \"visibility\" index that specifies AR location relative to the visible solar limb and expected flare detection. Flare labels are assigned according to peak Soft X-ray flux, and a statistical classification is performed using nonparametric discriminant analysis. A version where new or emerging ARs on the far (\"invisible\" side of the Sun are incorporated into the model by way of far-side helioseismology, is also tested. We evaluate the new framework by its performance specifically including the limb areas using Brier Skill Score and ROC Skill Score, finding improvement at the 2-sigma level or less. However, we do find that the number of False Negatives, or \"missed\" forecasts decreases, and find strong evidence that the additional information provided by the far-side helioseismology can help predict near- and just-beyond-limb flares, particularly for East-limb events. While individual components of this framework could be improved, we demonstrate that a known failure mode for solar flare forecasting can be mitigated with available resources.",

Duvvuri, Amy Louca, Yamila Miguel Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation is a driving source of photochemistry in planetary atmospheres. Proper interpretation of atmospheric observations requires a full understanding of the radiation environment that a planet is exposed to. Using the Suborbital Imaging Spectrograph for Transition-region Irradiance from Nearby Exoplanet host stars (SISTINE) rocket-borne spectrograph, we observed the Sun-like binary system $\\alpha$ Centauri AB and captured the FUV spectrum of both stars simultaneously. Our spectra cover 980--1570 Å, providing the broadest FUV wavelength coverage taken in a single exposure and spanning several key stellar emission features which are important photochemical drivers. Combining the SISTINE spectrum with archival observations, model spectra, and a novel stellar activity model, we have created spectral energy distributions (SEDs) spanning 5 Å--1 mm for both $\\alpha$ Centauri A and B. We use the SEDs to estimate the total high-energy flux (X-ray--UV) incident on a hypothetical exoplanet orbiting $\\alpha$ Centauri A. Because the incident flux varies over time due to the orbit of the stellar companion and the activity level of each star, we use the VULCAN photochemical kinetics code to estimate atmospheric chemical abundances in the case of minimum and maximum flux exposure. Our results indicate that enhanced atmospheric mass loss due to stellar binarity will likely not be an issue for future exoplanet-hunting missions such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory when searching for Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars.",

Kosovichev, Chunlei Liang Accepted for publication in ApJS Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Fluid-dynamics simulations of global solar convection are a critically important tool for assessing the dynamics of the solar interior. However, simulation studies with a fully compressible hydrodynamics code are not yet common. The CHORUS++ code solves robustly and efficiently the fully compressible hydrodynamics equations using a compact local spectral method and semi-unstructured grid system. Using the CHORUS++ code, we simulate the solar interior plasma flows from 0.7 to 0.99 of the solar radius using the values of the solar total luminosity and the sidereal rotation rate. In this paper, we analyze the simulated global flow structures before the statistically stable state to assess the compressibility of the plasma flows obtained with the fully compressible hydrodynamic code. The divergence of mass flux with the compressible model is overall small in the examined state before reaching the equilibrium state of the convection, which implies that the differences between the fully compressible flows and those obtained with the anelastic, incompressible, or linear-equation models are small in the simulated inner part of the convection zone. Although a fully-relaxed stationary convection has not been achieved yet in the examined state, the model qualitatively reproduces the solar-type differential rotation. Simulations for longer periods are needed to achieve the system relaxation state. This work, assessing the early phase of the hydrodynamic evolution of solar convection, is our first step toward a better understanding of the nature of solar convection and the dynamo processes.",

One way to look into the composition of these environments is to observe how they can contaminate the stellar photospheres. For that, we examine how stellar radiation pressure and gravity influence atomic species and analyse their effects across various stellar effective temperatures. Using the radiative-to-gravitational force ratio, we determined the atomic movement direction and assessed the velocity boost imparted to neutral atoms escaping from exoplanet atmospheres or debris discs. Incorporating the solar far ultraviolet/extreme ultraviolet spectrum to address flux discrepancies in the {\\sc{atlas9}} model, we find that radiation affects atoms differently according to their ionisation state, with highly ionised species less affected by stellar radiation. Our results conclude that the stars most suitable for observing stellar contamination are those between 6,500 and 8,000 K, with neutral noble gases and ionised iron-peak elements as the most likely contaminants.",

Rodríguez S., Hans Van Winckel Science white paper submitted in the context of ESO's Expanding Horizons call Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Stars and planets form, live, and evolve in unison. Throughout the life of a star, dusty circumstellar discs and stellar outflows influence the further evolution of both the star(s) and their orbiting planet(s). Planet-forming discs, winds of red giant branch (RGB) or asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and post-RGB/post-AGB discs are examples of such host environments where dust physics plays a key role. The physical processes that occur during each of these stages establishes how the Solar System as well as exoplanetary systems were formed, are evolving, and will eventually die. This White Paper aims to bridge the fields of stellar evolution and planet formation by peering into the dust kinematics and macrostructure formation, and its effect on planet-host interaction, in dusty environments from stellar birth to death. Near-future advancements in the 2030s will enable the detection, orbital monitoring and atmospheric/mineralogical characterisation of close-in (proto)planets across diverse stages of stellar evolution. To take full advantage of these developments by the 2040s, we should develop the capabilities required to image the varied dusty environments in which planets are entrained over their lifetime. This will enable extensive testing of current theoretical understandings - from the micro-scales of dust assembly to the deeply interlinked macro-scales of planet-host interactions - across diverse settings often too small, distant, and faint to be resolved in the next decade, simultaneously providing valuable constraints on the two-way interplay of dusty host environments and planetary formation/evolution.",

Mdhluli (on behalf of the IAU Office of Astronomy for Development) Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph) Astronomy, often perceived as a distant or luxury science, holds immense potential as a driver for sustainable local socio-economic development. This paper explores how astronomy can create tangible benefits for communities through education, tourism, technology transfer, and capacity building. Using case studies from South Africa, Chile, Indonesia, and India, we demonstrate how astronomical facilities and initiatives have stimulated local economies, generated employment, supported small enterprises, and enhanced STEM participation, while simultaneously inspiring a sense of shared global heritage. The analysis identifies both successes and challenges, including unequal benefit distribution, limited local ownership, and sustainability gaps once external funding ends. Building on these lessons, we propose a practical framework/guidelines for designing, implementing, and evaluating astronomy-based community initiatives, rooted in participatory engagement and aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper positions astronomy as a catalyst for inclusive growth, demonstrating that investment in the cosmos can translate into grounded, measurable benefits for people and places on Earth.",

      "abstract": "Exploring Metal Additive Manufacturing in Martian Atmospheric Environments Zane Mebruer, Wan Shou Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) In-space manufacturing is essential for achieving long-term planetary colonization, particularly on Mars, where material transport from Earth is both costly and logistically restrictive. Traditional subtractive manufacturing methods are highly equipment-, energy-, and material-intensive, making additive manufacturing (AM) a more practical and sustainable alternative for extraterrestrial production. Among various AM technologies, selective laser melting (SLM) stands out due to its exceptional versatility, precision, and capability to produce dense metallic parts with complex geometries. However, conventional SLM processes rely heavily on inert argon environments to prevent oxidation and ensure high-quality part formation, conditions that are difficult to reproduce on Mars. This study investigates the feasibility of using carbon dioxide (CO2), which makes up over 95% of the Martian atmosphere, as a potential substitute for argon in SLM. Single-track and two-dimensional 316L stainless steel specimens were fabricated under argon, CO2, and ambient air environments with a wide range of laser parameters to evaluate the influence of atmospheric composition on surface morphology, microstructural cohesion, and oxidation behavior. The results reveal that no single parameter controls the overall part quality; rather, a balance of parameters is essential to maintain thermal equilibrium during fabrication. Although parts produced in CO2 exhibited slightly inferior surface finish, cohesion, and oxidation resistance compared to argon, they performed significantly better than those fabricated in ambient air. These findings suggest that CO2-assisted SLM could enable sustainable in situ manufacturing on Mars and may also serve as a cost-effective alternative shielding gas for terrestrial applications.",

These full-orbit phase curve observations were taken over 37.8 hours (1.57 days), and provide an excellent testbed of the non-linearity behavior of NRS1 and NRS2 over long timescales. For both detectors, our analysis demonstrates charge losses at the center of the spectral trace and charge excesses at the trace edges. We find that the NRS1 detector displays ~3x larger deviations from linearity compared to NRS2. Given the large transit (~1.5%) and eclipse (~0.5%) signals for WASP-121b, we also investigate variations in the distribution of charge throughout the time-series observation. Our results show that charge distribution varies at different planetary orbital phases for NRS1, which manifests as a change in the morphology and shape of the spectral trace over the course of the time-series. The effect of charge distribution on the trace shape is not evident for NRS2.",

Scargle, Sarah Wagner 12 pages, plus 9 pages in appendices, 9+1 figures, submitted to Astrophysical Journal Letters Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Multiple-frequency periodograms -- based on time series models consisting of two or more independent sinusoids -- have long been discussed. What is new here is the presentation of a practical, simple-to-use computational framework implementing this concept. Our algorithms have super resolution that evades the Rayleigh criterion, as well as provision for statistical weighting and tapering. They can be used for essentially any time series (e.g. time-tagged events or point measurements) with arbitrary sampling -- even or uneven. Examples of super resolution of synthetic data, sunspot numbers, and the rich pulsations of white dwarf J0135+5722, demonstrate practical applications. Appendices derive generalized periodograms using an arbitrary number of arbitrary basis functions (following Bretthorst, 1988)and define several examples of non-sinusoidal bases for these ``omnigrams.'' Application beyond the frequency domain is demonstrated with an autoregressive model exhibiting super resolution in the time domain. A GitHub repository containing omnigram code, and symbolic algebra scripts for generating it, will soon be available.",

However, practical SIDM work often requires bridging several layers, including microphysical scattering models, velocity-dependent effective cross sections, phenomenological astrophysical constraints, and (separately) data-driven halo fits, such as rotation curves. In this paper, we describe \\texttt{sidmkit}, a transparent and reproducible Python package designed to support SIDM ``micro$\\rightarrow$macro'' calculations and to provide a robust batch pipeline for fitting rotation curves in the SPARC data. On the SIDM side, \\texttt{sidmkit} implements velocity-dependent momentum-transfer cross sections for a Yukawa interaction using standard analytic approximations (Born, classical, and Hulthén-based) with a numerical partial-wave option for spot checks. It also provides consistent velocity-moment averaging for Maxwellian relative speeds, scattering-rate utilities, and curated literature \\emph{summary} constraints for regression tests and exploratory scans. On the rotation-curve side, we implement bounded non-linear least squares fits of NFW and Burkert halo models to SPARC baryonic decompositions, with optional mass-to-light priors and information-criterion summaries (AIC/BIC). For the demonstration dataset, we process 191 \\texttt{rotmod} galaxies (LTG+ETG bundles) and fit both NFW and Burkert models (382 total fits). We find that Burkert is preferred by $\\Delta \\mathrm{BIC} > 0$ for $65.4\\%$ of galaxies, with ``strong'' preference ($\\Delta \\mathrm{BIC}>6$) in $32.5\\%$ of galaxies;",

Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal (ApJ). Reconstruction and simulation source code available at this https URL Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will carry out a wide-field imaging and slitless spectroscopic survey of Type Ia Supernovae to improve our understanding of dark energy. Crucial to this endeavor is obtaining supernova spectra uncontaminated by light from their host galaxies. However, obtaining such spectra is made more difficult by the inherent problem in wide-field slitless spectroscopic surveys: the blending of spectra of close objects. The spectrum of a supernova will blend with the host galaxy, even from regions distant from the supernova on the sky. If not properly removed, this contamination will introduce systematic bias when the supernova spectra are later used to determine intrinsic supernova parameters and to infer the parameters of dark energy. To address this problem we developed an algorithm that makes use of the spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy at all available observatory roll angles to reconstruct a three-dimensional (3d; 2d spatial, 1d spectral) representation of the underlying host galaxy that accurately matches the 2d slitless spectrum of the host galaxy when projected to an arbitrary rotation angle. We call this ``scene reconstruction''. The projection of the reconstructed scene can be subtracted from an observation of a supernova to remove the contamination from the underlying host. Using simulated Roman data, we show that our method has extremely small systematic errors and significantly less random noise than if we subtracted a single perfectly aligned spectrum of the host obtained before or after the supernova was visible.",

This is an english translation of the french PhD manuscript available on this https URL Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Radiation hydrodynamics describes the interaction between high-temperature hypersonic plasmas and the radiation they emit or absorb, a coupling that plays a central role in many astrophysical phenomena related to accretion and ejection processes. The HADES code was developed to model such systems by coupling hydrodynamics with M1-gray or M1-multigroup radiative transfer models, which are well suited to optically intermediate media. Despite its accuracy, radiation hydrodynamics simulations remain extremely demanding in terms of computational cost. Two main limitations are responsible for this. First, the M1-multigroup model relies on a closure relation with no analytic expression, requiring expensive numerical evaluations. Second, the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition strongly restricts the time step of the explicit schemes used in HADES. To overcome these difficulties, two complementary Artificial Intelligence based strategies were developed in this thesis. The first approach consists in training a Multi-Layer Perceptron to approximate the M1-multigroup closure relation. This method achieves excellent accuracy while reducing the computational cost by a factor of 3000, making it the most efficient approach currently available for this task. This performance gain enables high-fidelity simulations of radiative shocks, in which radiation directly influences the shock structure. In particular, increasing spectral resolution slows down the shock and enlarges the radiative precursor. The second approach explores the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to directly solve the radiation hydrodynamics equations and extrapolate simulations beyond their initial time range. Tests on purely hydrodynamic shocks show accurate handling of discontinuities, but application to radiative shocks remains challenging and requires further investigation.",

Version 2: typos corrected, references added Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The Compton Spectrometer and Imager is an upcoming NASA space telescope in the MeV range. COSI's primary science goals include precisely mapping nuclear line and positron annihilation emission in the Milky Way galaxy through Compton imaging. This relies on our ability to maintain COSI's spectral performance over its mission lifetime. Changes to the detectors' gain characteristics over time will result in a non-linear stretching of the entire energy range. Moreover, observations from past MeV telescopes and proton-beam experiments have shown that radiation damage in space causes photopeak shifts and spectral line broadening. These necessitate a plan for regular, in-orbit calibration. In this study, we demonstrate a method to monitor and recalibrate the COSI detectors using background line emissions produced by the space radiation environment. We employ Monte Carlo simulations of particle background and show that strong background lines arise from nuclear excitation of COSI's detectors (germanium) and cryostat (aluminum) materials. These span COSI's entire bandwidth for single-site interactions and can be used to monitor the effects of radiation damage and gain shifts every eight hours at the full instrument level and every 24 days at the individual detector level. Methods developed by Pike et al. to correct the effects of hole trapping and gain characteristics can then be applied to recover the original spectral performance. These results inform COSI's telemetry requirements for calibration and housekeeping data, and rule out the need for an on-board radioactive calibration source which would have increased the complexity of the spacecraft.",

Performance of our testbed is validated on a single-mode fibre then harnessed to characterise a 19-port, multicore fibre fed photonic lantern. We uncover the typical wavelength scale at which the modal mapping evolves and measure the relative dispersion in the device, finding significant differences with idealised simulations.

The study is based on publicly available calibrated light curves and target pixel files accessed through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) cloud infrastructure. After extracting and normalizing the photometric time series, the light curve was phase-folded using an initial ephemeris and modeled with a physical transit model to determine the system's geometric parameters. From the transit modeling, we measure the planet-to-star radius ratio, orbital inclination, impact parameter, and transit duration. Adopting stellar parameters from the literature, we derive the planetary radius and transit depth, confirming the highly inflated nature of WASP-12 b. Individual mid-transit times were measured and used to refine the orbital ephemeris through a weighted linear fit. The resulting refined orbital period and reference epoch improve the predictive accuracy of future transit times over the TESS observational baseline. An observed-minus-calculated (O-C) analysis reveals no statistically significant transit timing variations, indicating that the timing data are consistent with a linear ephemeris within the measurement uncertainties. This work demonstrates the capability of TESS photometry to provide precise transit characterization and ephemeris refinement for well-studied exoplanet systems, and provides updated parameters that are relevant for future atmospheric and dynamical investigations of WASP-12 b.",

Richardson, Harrison Agrusa, Ryota Nakano The Planetary Science Journal, Volume 6, Number 12, 2025 Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) On 26 September 2022, the NASA Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) spacecraft impacted Dimorphos, the secondary component of the binary asteroid (65803)~Didymos. This experiment tested the Kinetic Impactor technology for diverting dangerous asteroids. Due to the impact, the binary system's angular momentum has changed, resulting in a significant change in the orbital period of Dimorphos. Precise values of the pre- and post-impact orbital periods were derived from a large set of photometric light curves measured for the Didymos-Dimorphos system during six apparitions from 2003 to 2023. We used these data to detect a possible change in the rotation period of the primary as a consequence of the impact. We analyzed the binary system's light curves using the binary asteroid light curve decomposition method. We selected parts of the light curves covering orbital phases outside mutual events, which represent the primary rotational light curves. We applied the light curve inversion method to construct a convex shape model of Didymos and determine its rotation period before and after the impact. These two periods were treated as independent free parameters of the modeling. We found a value of 2.2603891 +/- 0.0000002 h for the pre-impact period and 2.260440 +/- 0.000008 h for the post-impact period. Their difference 0.18 +/- 0.03 s is small yet significant, indicating that the rotation of Didymos became slower after the DART impact. The most plausible physical explanation is Didymos's post-impact reshaping, making its shape more oblate.",

This work addresses the problem of linking ballistic capture trajectories - exploiting multi-body dynamics for temporary lunar orbit insertion - with bounded periodic motion described in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP). A unified framework is developed for optimizing bi-impulsive transfers to families of periodic orbits via a high-order polynomial expansion of the CR3BP dynamics. That same expansion underlies a continuous parameterization of periodic orbit families, enabling rapid targeting and analytic sensitivity. Transfers to planar periodic orbit families - such as Lyapunov L1/L2 and distant retrograde orbits (DROs) - are addressed first, followed by extension to spatial families - such as butterfly and halo L1/L2 orbits - with an emphasis towards near-rectilinear halo orbits (NRHOs). Numerical results demonstrate low-{\\Delta}v solutions and validate the method's adaptability for designing lunar missions. The optimized trajectories can inform an established low-energy transfer database, enriching it with detailed cost profiles that reflect both transfer feasibility and underlying dynamical relationships to specific periodic orbit families. Finally, the proposed transfers provide reliable estimates for rapid refinement, making them readily adaptable for further optimization across mission-specific needs.",

      "abstract": "On the Possibility of Melting Water Ice during the Recent Past of Mars: Application to the Formation of Gullies Lucas Lange, Francois Forget Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The formation of gullies on Mars has often been attributed to the melting of (sub)surface water ice. However, melting-based hypotheses generally overlook key processes: (1) sublimation cooling by latent heat absorption, (2) the non-stability of ice where melting conditions can be reached, and (3) the particular microclimates of gullied slopes. Using state-of-the-art climate simulations, we reassess ice melting scenarios over the past four million years (obliquity <= 35°), beyond the estimated period of gully formation. We find that the melting of opaque water snow or ice at the surface of Mars is unlikely anywhere due to sublimation cooling, while (quasi-) stable subsurface ice is typically too deep to reach melting temperatures. We propose an alternative mechanism in which seasonal CO2 frost sublimation destabilizes the regolith and brings the underlying water ice close to the surface, allowing rapid heating. Even under these optimal conditions, melting requires unrealistic assumptions. Ice containing a small amount of dust could melt via a solid-state greenhouse effect, but both its possibility and frequency in Mars' recent past remain uncertain.",

Young, A.Falco Astronomy & Astrophysics, Volume 704, December 2025 Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Context. The equatorial region of Cthulhu as revealed by New Horizons appears to be generally dark and largely devoid of volatiles because its surface albedo is low. Localized bright patches, however, which are interpreted as CH4 frost, are observed on crater rims and slopes. Aims. Previous studies suggested that these frosts might result from the peculiar insolation driven by the geometry of these slopes, but this has never been tested quantitatively. We investigated the origin, stability, and potential role of these localized frost deposits in the volatile cycle of Pluto. Methods. We implemented a new subgrid-scale slope parameterization in the volatile transport model for Pluto, which accounts for the specific solar irradiation and the resulting surface and subsurface temperatures on sloped terrains. This parameterization also allows the condensation and sublimation of volatiles (either N2 or CH4) on slopes, including the effect of large-scale transport of these species. This is key to determining the amount of frost that forms or disappears. Results. Our simulations reproduce the observed CH4 frost on north-facing slopes as seasonal deposits that currently sublimate, predict perennial CH4 frost on south-facing slopes, and show that the slope microclimates are not expected to alter global volatile cycles. Conclusions. Seasonal and perennial N2 and CH4 frosts can form on the Pluto slopes, even in its darkest and warmest regions, because the locally sunlight received on inclined terrain is reduced. Despite the abundance of sloped surfaces on Pluto, the slope microclimates still only appear to have a minor effect on the global volatile cycles of the planet.",

Updated with community feedback, further comments welcome Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The number of objects in orbit is rapidly increasing, primarily driven by the launch of megaconstellations, an approach to satellite constellation design that involves large numbers of satellites paired with their rapid launch and disposal. While satellites provide many benefits to society, their use comes with challenges, including the growth of space debris, collisions, ground casualty risks, optical and radio-spectrum pollution, and the alteration of Earth's upper atmosphere through rocket emissions and reentry ablation. There is potential for current or planned actions in orbit to cause serious degradation of the orbital environment or lead to catastrophic outcomes, highlighting the urgent need to find better ways to quantify stress on the orbital environment. Here we propose a new metric, the CRASH Clock, that measures such stress in terms of the timescale for a possible catastrophic collision to occur if there are no satellite manoeuvres or there is a severe loss in situational awareness. Our calculations show the CRASH Clock is currently 5.5 days, which suggests there is limited time to recover from a wide-spread disruptive event, such as a solar storm. This is in stark contrast to the pre-megaconstellation era: in 2018, the CRASH Clock was 164 days.",
