Font, Juan Calderón Bustillo High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Mass estimates of white dwarfs via electromagnetic methods, often differ from those obtained through gravitational redshift measurements, in some cases with discrepancies ranging in $5-15\\%$ across independent datasets. Although many of the discrepancies reported in large spectroscopic surveys and confirmed by high-precision techniques such as astrometric microlensing and wide-binary analyses may be attributable to thermal effects, model uncertainties or measurement errors prevent a complete description of some of the observations. Here, we explore an alternative explanation based on the presence of a gravitationally coupled bosonic scalar field that contributes to the stellar mass while remaining electromagnetically invisible. We construct stationary, static mixed configurations consisting of a white dwarf that presents a bosonic scalar field (dark matter) component, forming a composite white dwarf-boson star system. We explore families of solutions showing that a scalar field fraction $f_{\\rm DM} \\sim 5-15\\%$ to the mass contribution can account for the observed redshift excess. Our models provide a physically motivated explanation for the mass bias, might offer new observational signatures, and allow us to place preliminary constraints on the mass and compactness of the scalar field configuration. Finally, using our theoretical framework in combination with Bayesian model selection we provide plausible bounds for the mass of the constituent (ultralight) bosonic particle.",

Comments are welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The cosmological principle, which asserts a statistically homogeneous and isotropic universe on large scales, is a foundational assumption of the standard cosmological model. A critical test of this principle involves the kinematic interpretation of the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature dipole, conventionally attributed to our peculiar motion relative to the cosmic rest frame. The Ellis-Baldwin test provides a probe of this kinematic interpretation by searching for a matching Doppler-driven dipole in the number counts of extragalactic radio sources. Recent measurements from the CatWISE2020 quasar catalog have reported a dipole amplitude significantly exceeding the kinematic expectation, with a claimed significance of $4.9\\sigma$. We present a comprehensive reassessment of this test using the same dataset, incorporating major sources of uncertainty in the statistical inference. We use a simulation framework based on the FLASK package, incorporating lognormal realizations of the large-scale structure, the quasar clustering bias, the survey's radial selection function, and its exact sky coverage. Our simulations account for the kinematic dipole, the intrinsic clustering dipole, shot noise, and survey geometry effects. The analysis yields a revised significance of the kinematic dipole excess of $3.63\\sigma$ in the absence of a clustering dipole, and $3.44\\sigma$ in the presence of a randomly oriented clustering dipole. When the clustering dipole is aligned with the kinematic dipole direction, the significance decreases further to $3.27\\sigma$. Our analysis demonstrates that although the anomaly is reduced in significance, it cannot be explained solely as a result of the clustering dipole or mode coupling arising from the survey mask.",

Motivated by this, we construct a theoretical framework in which a massive cosmological vector field, $B^{\\mu}$, couples non-minimally to the background curvature through marginal interactions, offering a controlled mechanism to realise the deviation from the $\\Lambda$CDM model. A detailed analysis of the effective Equation of State (EoS) parameter $w(\\tilde H)$ reveals a narrow region of parameter space consistent with current cosmological observations presented by DESI. The analysis yields a stringent upper bound for the coupling constant $\\lambda$ to be $\\lambda<2.98\\times10^{-11}$, a very strong bound on mass $3.1356\\times10^{-66}~\\text{g} \\leq m \\leq 3.3627\\times10^{-66}~\\text{g},$ and the admissible range $-0.405 \\leq \\log_{10}\\tilde\\gamma \\leq -0.38$ for which present-day value $w_0 = w(\\tilde H = 1)$ corresponding to a deviation $\\delta = w_0 + 1$ that lies within the region $0.107 \\leq \\delta \\leq 0.217$. This interval reproduces the deviation inferred from the combined DESI, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), and Pantheon+ data, reflecting a controlled departure from the $\\Lambda$CDM behaviour. In summary, the results suggest that the proposed framework of a massive vector field can account for the departure from $\\Lambda$CDM behaviour highlighted by DESI in the current cosmic acceleration. Furthermore, the framework approaches the $\\Lambda$CDM behaviour in late-time $t\\gtrsim28$ Gyr, establishing a direct phenomenological link between the underlying parameters and the observed dynamical nature of dark energy.",

Version accepted by JCAP (Abstract above is shortened to comply with arXiv's limit.) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Cosmic magnification is able to probe the geometry of large-scale structure on cosmological scales, thereby providing another window for probing theories of the late-time cosmic acceleration. It holds the potential to reveal new information on the nature of dark energy and modified gravity. By using the angular power spectrum, we investigated cosmic magnification beyond weak lensing (incorporating all known relativistic corrections) in beyond-Horndeski gravity$-$with both constant phenomenology and dynamic phenomenology, respectively. For both phenomenologies our results show that the total relativistic signal surpasses cosmic variance (considering an SKA2-like sky coverage) in the magnification angular power spectrum at low redshifts ($z\\lesssim 0.5$), hence cosmic-variance reduction methods like multi-tracer analysis will not be needed for surveys at the given $z$. For the individual relativistic signals, we found that the Doppler magnification signal also surpasses cosmic variance and remains the dominant signal, at low $z$, for both phenomenologies. However, the integrated-Sachs-Wolfe, the time-delay, and the gravitational (potential) magnification signals, respectively, are subdominant to both the Doppler magnification signal and cosmic variance, at the same $z$; hence multi-tracer analysis will be needed to isolate these signals. At high redshifts ($z\\gtrsim 3$), the integrated-Sachs-Wolfe, the time-delay, and the gravitational magnification signals, respectively, appear to surpass cosmic variance and dominate over the Doppler magnification signal for constant phenomenology; whereas for dynamic phenomenology, all these signals diminish significantly and are well below cosmic variance, at all $z$ (consistent with recent quintessence analysis). Suggesting that including time-variation in the parameters will be crucial in identifying the true signature of the beyond-Horndeski gravity.",

Published in Chinese Physics C 50 (2026) 015106 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) $F(R)$ models for dark energy generally exhibit a weak curvature singularity, which can be cured by adding an $R^2$ term. This correction allows for a unified description of primordial and late-time accelerated expansions. However, most existing models struggle to achieve this, as they become unstable over certain negative ranges of the Ricci scalar, where either the first or second derivative of $F(R)$ turns negative. These instabilities may disrupt the post-inflationary evolution when the Ricci scalar oscillates about the vacuum state after the $R^2$ inflation. In this work, we introduce a new model-building to guarantee global stability, i.e., the first and second derivatives are positive for all real Ricci scalars. By extending the idea from Appleby and Battye, we demonstrate that viable models can be constructed by imposing a positive, bounded first derivative of $F(R)$ with a sigmoid shape. As examples, we first reformulate and generalize the original Appleby-Battye model. Then, we propose a new dark energy model, which successfully explains the acceleration of cosmic expansion and passes local gravity tests.",

The resulting gravitational wave spectrum is sensitive to the evolutionary history of the universe and can be substantially enhanced by early matter-dominated (eMD) epochs, particularly if they end rapidly. Such epochs can be caused by primordial black holes (PBHs) and non-topological solitons (Q-balls), for example. Prior analysis approximated the end of the eMD epoch as instantaneous or used a Gaussian smoothing. In this work, we present a complete analysis fully incorporating their time-evolving decay rates. We demonstrate that the resulting signal spectra from PBH, thin wall Q-ball, thick wall Q-ball, and delayed Q-ball eMD epochs are distinguishable for monochromatic distributions. We then consider log-normal mass distributions and discuss the distinguishability of the various GW spectra. Importantly we find that the change in the spectrum from a finite mass width is qualitatively different from the change arising from a slower transition to radiation domination.",

This work proposes a novel calibration method for FRBs using the Yang-Li-Zhang (YLZ) empirical relation, which links the rotation measure (RM) of FRBs to the luminosity of their associated persistent radio sources (PRS). We demonstrate that this approach provides independent constraints on cosmological parameters, bypassing limitations inherent to traditional $\\mathrm{DM}-z$ method.

Monte Carlo simulations indicate that a future catalog of 400 FRB-PSR systems could reduce the relative uncertainty of $H_0$ to 4.5\\%. Combining YLZ-calibrated FRBs with $\\mathrm{DM}-z$ sample reveals critical synergies: joint analysis of equalized samples ($N=100$ for both methods) reduces the relative uncertainty of $H_0$ to 2.9\\%, mainly because the incorporation of PRS observations substantially mitigates the degeneracy between the parameters such as IGM baryon mass fraction ($f_{\\rm IGM}$) and other cosmological parameters inherent to the $\\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation.",

This analysis constrains the cosmological scenarios influenced by different models through the joint examination of a range of recently available cosmological probes, specifically the Pantheon+ sample and the DESY5 sample of Type Ia Supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, Hubble parameter measurements derived from cosmic chronometers, and cosmic microwave background distance priors based on the Planck 2018 data. Furthermore, we provide a concise perspective on the dynamical evolution of all models (CPL, PADE, GEDE, GDE, BellDE) and their interrelations. A Bayesian inference procedure is adopted to estimate the models parameters that yield the best fit to the data. The EoS remains within the phantom regime at higher redshifts, while favoring the quintessence regime in the current epoch. In this context, we propose a new Gaussian-like form of EoS, termed BellDE, which avoids phantom behavior (\\(w \\geq -1\\)) at higher redshifts while remaining precisely calibrated at lower redshifts. Interestingly, BellDE exhibits a transient phantom nature (\\(w < -1\\)) around the transition redshift \\(z \\sim 0.5\\), subsequently evolving into a quintessential regime (\\(w > -1\\)). In particular, the BellDE model provides competitive statistical preference while offering greater flexibility in the redshift regime $z \\sim 0.5-1$, where DE is observationally significant.",

Such techniques rely on the different relationship between the overdensity of tracers and the broader matter overdensity, enabling cosmic-variance-free tests of primordial non-Gaussianity in the initial curvature perturbations. There is a great opportunity for current and future all-sky extra-galactic radio surveys to make use of this technique to test for non-Gaussianity at a precision greater than existing all-sky constraints from the cosmic microwave background. To realize this goal there is a need for accurate simulations. Previous radio galaxy simulations have either been realistic but covering only a small area (and so unhelpful for cosmological forecasts), or all-sky dark matter only cosmological simulations but having no connection to a real radio galaxy population. In this study, we use the FLAMINGO suite of cosmological surveys, as well as the matching of dark matter halos to radio galaxy population, to create an accurate sky simulation in order to examine the feasibility of multi-tracer techniques. We present an analysis of the clustering (with a bias model for the simulation), as well as redshift distributions, source counts and radio luminosity functions, and discuss future work on non-Gaussianity detection.",

Davis, David Camarena, Francis-Yan Cyr-Racine Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Neutrinos with Standard Model interactions free-stream in the early Universe, leaving a distinct phase shift in the pattern of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). When isolated, this phase shift allows one to robustly infer the presence of the cosmic neutrino background in BAO and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data independently of other cosmological parameters. While in the context of the Standard Model, this phase shift follows a known scale-dependent relation, new physics in the cosmic neutrino background could alter the overall shape of this feature. In this paper, we discuss how changes in the neutrino phase shift could be used to constrain self-interactions among neutrinos. We produce simple models for this phase-shift assuming universal self-interactions, and use these in order to understand what constraining power is available for the strength of such interactions in BAO and CMB data. We find that, although challenging, it may be possible to use a detection of the phase to put a more robust limit on the strength of the self-interaction, $G_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, which at present suffers from bimodality in cosmological constraints. Our forecast analysis reveals that BAO data alone will not provide the precision needed to tightly constrain self-interactions; however, the combined analysis of the phase shift signature in both CMB and BAO can potentially provide a way to detect the impact of new neutrino interactions. Our results could be extended upon for models with non-universal interactions.",

Ferreira, Carlo Baccigalupi Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Precise estimation of cosmological parameters from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) remains a central goal of modern cosmology and a key test of inflationary physics. However, this task is fundamentally limited by strong foreground contamination, primarily from Galactic emissions, which obscure the faint CMB B-mode polarization signal. In this Letter, we introduce a fast, simulation-based, end to end pipeline that integrates a robust component separation technique with machine-learning, leading to cosmological parameter estimation. Our approach combines the Analytical Blind Separation (ABS) method for foreground removal with a neural network (NN) framework optimized to extract cosmological parameters directly from full-sky simulations. We assess the performance of this methodology for the forthcoming LiteBIRD and PICO satellite missions, designed to detect CMB B modes with unprecedented sensitivity. Applying the pipeline to realistic sky simulations, we obtain 1 sigma errors of 0.0035 (LiteBIRD) and 0.0030 (PICO) for the optical depth tau, and 0.005 (LiteBIRD) and 0.0014 (PICO) for the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r. In all cases, the recovered parameters are consistent with input values within 1 sigma across most of the parameter space. Results for LiteBIRD are in excellent agreement with the latest forecasts from the collaboration. Our findings establish this combined ABS-NN pipeline as a competitive, accurate, and computationally efficient alternative for cosmological parameter inference, offering a powerful framework for forthcoming CMB experiments.",

We investigate how baryonic physics affects the strength and redshift evolution of GAB using the largest runs of two state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: SIMBA and IllustrisTNG. We quantify GAB by comparing the clustering of stellar-mass-selected galaxies to that of shuffled samples, where galaxies are randomly reassigned to haloes of similar mass. We find that GAB in both simulations increases from approximately zero at $z=5$ to a $\\sim\\,5\\%$ change in clustering amplitude at $z=2$. After this epoch, the trends diverge: GAB in TNG continues to increase, reaching $\\sim\\,10\\%$ at $z=0$, while in SIMBA it decreases to nearly zero. By further shuffling galaxies within bins of halo mass and cosmic environment -- characterised by smoothed matter overdensity ($\\delta_5$) and tidal anisotropy ($\\alpha_5$) -- we show that most of the GAB in both simulations can be attributed to the overdensity, while tidal anisotropy contributes negligibly in both simulations. Exploring this effect from the point of view of the halo occupation distribution (HOD), we find that numbers of central and satellite galaxies vary with overdensity -- but only near the respective turn-on masses for these two constituents: the galaxy contents of high-mass haloes are very nearly independent of environment. We present a simple parameterisation that allows the HOD modelling to be modified to reflect this form of density-dependent GAB.",

This hierarchy can be naturally explained by $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, which after spontaneous symmetry breaking, simultaneously generates Majorana masses for neutrinos and produces a network of cosmic strings. Such strings generate a gravitational wave (GW) spectrum which is expected to be almost uniform in frequency unless there is a departure from the usual early radiation domination. We explore this possibility in Type I, II and III seesaw frameworks, finding that only for Type-I, long-lived right-handed neutrinos (RHN) may provide a period of early matter domination for parts of the parameter space, even if they are thermally produced. Such a period leaves distinctive imprints in the GW spectrum in the form of characteristic breaks and a knee feature, arising due to the end and start of the periods of RHN domination. These features, if detected, directly determine the mass $M$, and effective neutrino mass $\\tilde m$ of the dominating RHN. We find that GW detectors like LISA and ET could probe RHN masses in the range $M\\in[0.1,10^{9}]$ GeV and effective neutrino masses in the $\\tilde m\\in[10^{-10},10^{-8}]$ eV range. We investigate the phenomenological implications of long-lived right-handed neutrinos for both local and global $U(1)_{B-L}$ strings, focusing on dark matter production and leptogenesis. We map the viable and detectable parameter space for successful baryogenesis and asymmetric dark matter production from right-handed neutrino decays. We derive analytical and semi-analytical relations correlating the characteristic gravitational-wave frequencies to the neutrino parameters $\\tilde m$ and $M$, as well as to the relic abundances of dark matter and baryons.",

ZuHone Resubmitted to ApJ in response to referee's comments High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present results from very deep (485 ks) Chandra X-ray observations of the relaxed, cool core cluster Abell 2029 (z = 0.0767). A2029 hosts one of the longest, most continuous sloshing spirals ever observed, which we find extends nearly 600 kpc from the cluster core. In addition to providing detailed views of the sloshing spiral, imaging and spectroscopic analysis reveals ICM substructure related to the merger history including a broad ``splash'' of cooler gas and a potential merger shock. The radio lobes of the central WAT source show evidence of alignment with the sloshing motions, consistent with ICM bulk flow, rather than host-galaxy motion, being the primary driver of lobe bending. Comparison to a 1:10 mass-ratio off-axis merger simulation indicates that the observed ICM structures are relics of a second core passage of a subcluster ~4 Gyr after the start of the merger, where the ``splash'' feature is revealed to be a wake of cool gas trailing behind the subcluster. Overall, our results suggest that A2029 is still settling from past interactions -- showing that even the initially most relaxed-looking clusters can be hiding a rich history of dynamical activity.",

AXIS will advance the legacy of high-angular-resolution X-ray astronomy with ~1.5'' imaging over a wide 24' field of view and an order of magnitude greater collecting area than Chandra in the 0.3-12 keV band. Combining sharp imaging, high throughput, and rapid response capabilities, AXIS will open new windows on virtually every aspect of modern astrophysics, exploring the birth and growth of supermassive black holes, the feedback processes that shape galaxies, the life cycles of stars and exoplanet environments, and the nature of compact stellar remnants, supernova remnants, and explosive transients. This book compiles over 140 community-contributed science cases developed by five Science Working Groups focused on AGN and supermassive black holes, galaxy evolution and feedback, compact objects and supernova remnants, stellar physics and exoplanets, and time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. Together, these studies establish the scientific foundation for next-generation X-ray exploration in the 2030s and highlight strong synergies with facilities of the 2030s, such as JWST, Roman, Rubin/LSST, SKA, ALMA, ngVLA, and next-generation gravitational-wave and neutrino networks.",

Wollack 21 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables, submitted to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We probe the stellar mass growth in a sample of 568 Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) selected galaxy clusters with masses greater than $2.9 \\times 10^{14} \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ and redshifts in the range $0.2 < z < 0.8$, drawn from the fifth data release of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT DR5). By utilising deep photometry from the tenth data release of the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS DR10), we construct redshift- and cluster mass-binned composite cluster stellar mass functions (SMFs), down to $M_* = 10^{9.5} \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$. This work presents the first analysis of the cluster SMF for this specific cluster sample at this epoch. We find that the characteristic stellar mass ($M^*$) of the cluster SMF evolves marginally from $0.55 \\leq z < 0.8$, with most of the measurable growth occurring at $ 0.2 < z < 0.55$. This suggests that most of the massive galaxy population in clusters ($M_* \\gtrsim 10^{10.75} \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$) is largely established by $z \\sim 0.8$, with subsequent evolution driven primarily by late-time assembly processes. The low-mass slope ($\\alpha$) of the composite cluster SMF is flat at high-$z$ ($z \\sim 0.8$) but steepens at $z < 0.55$, suggesting an abundance of massive galaxies in high-$z$ clusters compared to low-$z$ clusters. Redshift evolution of cluster stellar mass fractions ($f^{\\mathrm{cg}}_{*}$) suggest that cluster stellar mass (from galaxies with $M_* > 10^{9.5} \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$) has grown by a factor of $3.3$ since $z = 0.8$.",

By separately modeling different components of the observed population of Globular Clusters (GCs), we confirm the existence of an abundant ICGCs over-density with a geometrically complex, elongated morphology roughly centered on the cluster dominant galaxy NGC 1399 and stretching along the E-W direction. We identify several areas in the ICGCs distribution that deviate from a simple elliptical model and feature large density enhancements. These regions are characterized based on their statistical significance, GCs excess number, position, size and location relative to the galaxies in their surroundings. The relations between the spatial distribution and features of the ICGCs structures, mostly populated by blue GCs, and properties of the intra-cluster light and dwarf galaxies detected in the core of the Fornax cluster are described and discussed. The line-of-sight velocity distribution of spectroscopically confirmed GCs within the ICGCs structures is compatible with the systemic velocities of nearby bright galaxies in the Fornax cluster, suggesting that the ICGCs population is at least partially composed of GCs stripped from their hosts. We argue that the findings here presented suggest that, on sub-cluster scales, different mechanisms contribute to the growth of the ICGC. The western region of Fornax is likely associated with old merging events that predate the assembly of the Fornax cluster. The eastern side instead points to a mix of tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies and stripping from the GCSs of massive hosts, more typical of relaxed, high-density cluster environments.",

We provide this to theoretically illustrate how much can be learned from these cross-correlation signals, once the cosmic neutrino background is detected with instruments in multiple locations. Against a naive expectation of null cross-correlation, we show that the signal is non zero, specially at the largest scales. We also discuss the scenario of co-located cross-correlations between dark matter, weak lensing and a future neutrino-induced photon emission signal. As cross-correlations will be comparable to auto-correlations of the cosmic neutrino background itself and are less affected by cosmic variance and shotnoise, these might be the ones to be measured first.

McMahon 47 pages, 15 figures, updated to match JCAP version Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a perfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from fundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($\\mu$-distortion) to late-time baryonic feedback processes ($y$-distortion). While the $y$-distortion can be detected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the $\\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a serious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\\mu$ arises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the primordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \\approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here, we present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly detecting $\\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but with an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we optimize the instrument's configuration to target $\\mu$ while marginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike Fourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their individual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing significant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the $\\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\\mu$-distortion at $\\approx 5\\sigma$ (10$\\sigma$) assuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission duration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized configuration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with $\\sim$degree-scale angular resolution at $\\sim150$ GHz and 1100 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally measure the $y$-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic correction at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total thermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.",

This black hole domination scenario is largely unconstrained for PBHs with masses $\\lesssim 10^9\\,\\mathrm{g}$, which evaporate prior to Big Bang nucleosynthesis. However, if the era of PBH domination is sufficiently long, the PBHs form clusters and can merge appreciably within these objects. We calculate the population statistics of these clusters within the Press-Schechter formalism and find that, for a wide range of PBH masses and Hubble rates at the onset of PBH domination, the mergers within PBH clusters can exhibit runaway behavior, where the majority of the cluster will eventually form a single black hole with a mass much greater than the original PBH mass. These mergers can dramatically alter the PBH mass distribution and leave behind merged relic black holes that evaporate after Big Bang nucleosynthesis and yield various observational signatures, excluding parameter choices previously thought to be viable",

However, recent tensions between different types of high-accuracy data highlight the need for novel probes of the cosmological parameters. Such a probe is the turnaround density: the mass density on the scale where galaxies around a cluster join the Hubble flow. To measure it, one must locate the distance from the cluster center where turnaround occurs. Earlier work has shown that a turnaround radius can be readily identified in simulations by analyzing the 3D dark matter velocity field. However, measurements using realistic data face challenges due to projection effects. This study aims to assess the feasibility of measuring the turnaround radius using machine learning techniques applied to simulated idealized observations of galaxy clusters. We employed N-body simulations across various cosmologies to generate galaxy cluster projections. Utilizing convolutional neural networks, we assessed the predictability of the turnaround radius based on galaxy line-of-sight velocity, number density, and mass profiles. We find a strong correlation between the turnaround radius and the central mass of a galaxy cluster, rendering the mass distribution outside the virial radius of little relevance to the model's predictive power. The velocity dispersion among galaxies also contributes valuable information concerning the turnaround radius. Importantly, the accuracy of a line-of-sight velocity model remains robust even when the data within the $\\mathrm{R_{200}}$ of the central overdensity are absent. Single-cluster turnaround radius inference from projected observables seems to be highly challenging. Future progress is likely to require statistical approaches, especially stacking, to exploit cosmological information encoded at turnaround scales.",

However, a more comprehensive test of the cosmological model should also include the lensing effect in low density regions. In this work, we incorporate the stacked weak lensing signals around the low density positions, alongside galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy-galaxy two point correlation function to perform a joint cosmological analysis on $\\sigma_8$. The low density positions are constructed from the DR9 data release of the DESI legacy imaging survey, using galaxies with r-band absolute magnitude cut M$<$-21.5 and in the redshift range of 0.18$<$z$<$0.28. In doing so, we simultaneously parameterize photometric redshift errors and halo mass uncertainties while building mock catalogs from simulations using the method of SubHalo Abundance Matching (SHAM). For the weak lensing measurements, we use the shear estimators derived from the DECaLS DR8 imaging data, processed by the Fourier_Quad pipeline. The survey boundaries and masks are fully taken into account. Our analysis achieves a total significance of $31.1\\sigma$ detection for lensing in the low density positions, which significantly improve the $\\sigma_8$ constraint compared to galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy-galaxy two point correlation function by 14$\\%$. For flat $\\Lambda$CDM model, we constrain $\\sigma_8$ =$0.824^{+0.015}_{-0.015}$, which shows a good agreement with the PLANCK result. Additionally, the halo mass uncertainty $\\sigma_{\\lg M}$ and photometric redshift error $\\sigma_z$ are constrained to be $0.565^{+0.086}_{-0.070}$ and $0.004^{+0.004}_{-0.003}$ respectively, which are somewhat different from our expectations due to the significant degeneracy of the two parameters.",

Accepted for publication in JCAP Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Subhalos play a crucial role in accurately modeling galaxy formation and galaxy-based cosmological probes within the highly nonlinear, virialized regime. However, numerical convergence of subhalo evolution is difficult to achieve, especially in the inner regions of host halos where tidal forces are strongest. I investigate the numerical convergence and correction methods for the abundance, spatial, and velocity distributions of subhalos using two $6144^3$-particle cosmological N-body simulations with different mass resolutions -- Jiutian-300 ($1.0 \\times 10^{7}\\,h^{-1}M_{\\odot}$) and Jiutian-1G ($3.7 \\times 10^{8}\\,h^{-1}M_{\\odot}$) -- with subhalos identified by HBT+. My study shows that the Surviving subhalo Peak Mass Function (SPMF) converges only for subhalos with $m_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ above $5000$ particles but can be accurately recovered by including orphan subhalos that survive according to the merger timescale model of Jiang et al., which outperforms other models. Including orphan subhalos also enables recovery of the real-space spatial and velocity distributions to $5$--$10\\%$ accuracy down to scales of $0.1$--$0.2\\,h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$. The remaining differences are likely due to cosmic variance and finite-box effects in the smaller Jiutian-300 simulation. Convergence below $0.1\\,h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$ remains challenging and requires more sophisticated modeling of orphan subhalos. I further highlight that redshift-space multipoles are more difficult to recover even at larger scales because unreliable small-scale pairs at $r_{\\mathrm{p}} < 0.1\\,h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$ in real space affect scales of tens of $\\mathrm{Mpc}$ in redshift space due to elongated Fingers-of-God effects.

If compact dark matter (DM) candidates, e.g. primordial black holes, contribute a substantial fraction of the DM component across a broad mass range, they would yield distinctive micro-lensing signatures on GW signals. In this paper, based on the third-generation ground-based GW detector, i.e. Einstein Telescope, we propose to constrain population information of compact DM by simulating micro-lensing GWs and analyzing with the hierarchical Bayesian inference framework. For a population with a power-law mass function, we demonstrate that detections of several micro-lensing GW signals in $10^4$ binary black holes coalescence events would constrain the abundance of compact DM to $\\sim10^{-3}$. It suggests that searching for and identifying micro-lensing signatures in future detections could be complementary and helpful in constraining compact DM scenarios.",

In this study, we constraint the baryonic content of these filaments using localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Filaments are identified from the galaxy distribution in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) imaging surveys using the DisPerSE algorithm. We find tentative evidence ($\\sim 3 \\sigma$ significance) for a divergence in the relationship between the dispersion measure (DM) contributed by the intergalactic medium and redshift for FRBs whose signals intersect cosmic filaments compared to those that do not, suggesting excess baryons in the filamentary structures. Assuming an isothermal $\\beta$-model gas profile with $\\beta=2/3$, this discrepancy is best explained by a central baryon overdensity of $\\delta_0 = 21^{+13}_{-12}$, broadly consistent with previous simulation and observational results. The inferred baryon fraction residing in filaments decreases with redshift, from approximately $0.25$-$0.30\\,\\Omega_b$ at $z=0.02$ to $0.15$-$0.30\\,\\Omega_b$ at $z=0.5$, and $0.03$-$0.04\\,\\Omega_b$ at $z=0.8$. These estimates are likely lower bounds, particularly at $z>0.5$, due to the limited number of identified filaments and localized FRBs at higher redshifts.

Pratt Updated to match version published in A&A Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present first detailed maps of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect on a $z = 0.89$ cluster with the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA). The high sensitivity of these observations enabled the effective identification and removal of the millimetre-wave sources contaminating the tSZ signal, thus isolating the influence of the hot electron gas of the cluster on the cosmic microwave background radiation from other emissions. The tSZ observed with success by NOEMA was modelled together with previous single-dish observations (IRAM 30-metre, Green Bank Telescope, and Caltech Sub-millimeter Observatory) to obtain the first core-to-outskirts (from $\\sim$ 15 to $\\sim$ 1500 kpc) pressure profile reconstruction on such a high-redshift galaxy cluster. NOEMA observations with a high angular resolution have shown that the pressure profile is flat in the core of the cluster. These observations confirm the disturbed nature of CL J1226.9+3332 and map for the first time the distribution of its thermal gas at arcsecond scales in the environments of the central cluster galaxy. Our results showcase the excellent capabilities of NOEMA to complement and enhance the data provided by other millimetre-wave instruments in resolving the core of high-redshift clusters via tSZ emission.",

Importantly, our simulations model the impact of both the massive Standard Model neutrinos and LiMRs, which will be crucial in disentangling possible degeneracies. We systematically explore the effects of LiMR properties such as mass, temperature, and initial distribution, on various cosmological observables, including the total matter power spectrum, Halo Mass Functions (HMF), Mass-Concentration relation, radial halo profiles, and weak lensing signals around massive clusters.

The extended AP test method uses the full shape of redshift-space two-point correlation funcion(CF) as the standard shape in order to measure the expansion history of the universe. We calibrate the standard shape by using the cosmology-dependent nonlinear evolution of the CF shape in the Multiverse simulations. Further validation of the method and calibration of possible systematics are performed based on mock samples from the Horizon Run 4 simulation. Using the AP test alone, we constrain the flat CDM plus CPL-type dark energy model (flat $w^{\\rm CPL}$CDM) to have $\\Omega_m=0.289_{-0.029}^{+0.031}$, $w_0=-0.798_{-0.102}^{+0.192}$ and $w_a=-0.165_{-0.945}^{+0.610}$. The result does not show evidence for a dynamically evolving dark energy model. When combined with other results from the low-redshift universe, such as the PantheonPlus supernova compilation and DESI BAO data, the constraint on $w_a$ becomes $w_a=-0.124_{-0.368}^{+0.334}$, which is still consistent with zero.",

Chiang, Frank C. van den Bosch, Hsi-Yu Schive 17 pages, 16 figures; Matches published version Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) It is common practice, both in dynamical modelling and in idealised numerical simulations, to assume that galaxies and/or dark matter haloes are spherical and have isotropic velocity distributions, such that their distribution functions are ergodic. However, there is no good reason to assume that this assumption is accurate. In this paper we use idealised $N$-body simulations to study the tidal evolution of subhaloes that are anisotropic at infall. We show that the detailed velocity anisotropy has a large impact on the subhalo's mass loss rate. In particular, subhaloes that are radially anisotropic experience much more mass loss than their tangentially anisotropic counterparts. In fact, in the former case, the stripping of highly radial orbits can cause a rapid cusp-to-core transformation, without having to resort to any baryonic feedback processes. Once the tidal radius becomes comparable to the radius of the core thus formed, the subhalo is tidally disrupted. Subhaloes that at infall are tangentially anisotropic are far more resilient to tidal stripping, and are never disrupted when simulated with sufficient resolution. We show that the preferential stripping of more radial orbits, combined with re-virialisation post stripping, causes an isotropisation of the subhalo's velocity distributions. This implies that subhaloes that have experienced significant mass loss are expected to be close to isotropic, which may alleviate the mass-anisotropy degeneracies that hamper the dynamical modelling of Milky Way satellites.",

Published in MNRAS Mon Not R Astron Soc (2025) 1494-1517 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the impact of secondary bias -- specifically, the correlation between star formation rate (SFR) and halo bias at fixed halo mass -- on the line-intensity mapping (LIM) power spectrum. In LIM, the galaxy contributions are flux-weighted, and therefore depend on the luminosity of emission line. We show that the (ensemble-averaged) large-scale two-halo term of the power spectrum depends only on the mean luminosity-halo mass relation if the scatter is uncorrelated with halo bias. However, when luminosity correlates with halo bias at fixed mass, this assumption breaks down. For many emission lines (e.g. H$\\alpha$), luminosity is strongly correlated with SFR, making the SFR-weighted power spectrum important to study. In IllustrisTNG, secondary bias increases the two-halo term of the SFR-weighted power spectrum by 5 per cent at $z \\sim 1.5$ compared to a model with random scatter. We also find that SFRs of central and satellite galaxies are correlated, enhancing the one-halo term -- which depends on the distribution of SFR inside the halo -- by 10 per cent relative to random pairings. To mitigate secondary bias in the two-halo term, we identify halo concentration (for haloes with mass $\\log M_h \\lesssim 12$) and satellite mass (for $\\log M_h \\gtrsim 12$) as effective secondary parameters. These results highlight the need to account for secondary bias when building mock catalogues and interpreting LIM observations.",

We visually inspected 370 NVGRC sources, as well as radio sources falling within a neighborhood of about one square degree around the target object. In the studied sample, 48% of objects were classified as giant radio sources, 14% as sources with a projected linear size of less than 0.72 Mpc, and 38\\% as physically unrelated objects combined by the recognition algorithm into one radio source. We identified 197 gaints, of which 72 radio sources are known GRGs or GRQs, and 125 sources were identified by us as GRS for the first time. Comparing the proportion of FRI giants in four redshift bins, we found that for z<0.05, the proportions of FRI and FRII sources were approximately equal, but already at z>0.15 the proportion of FRI giants decreases sharply. The predominance of FRII giants in the GRS lists is most likely due to observational selection due to the sensitivity limit of existing radio surveys. Comparing the NVSS and VLASS cutouts, we found that 33% of sources can be classified as fadded. 25% of the sources show a restart of the radio source phase. 38% of the sources have deformed radio lobes. Our GRS sample includes 74% of galaxies, 15% of IR-excess galaxies, which, according to the WISE photometric data, can be attributed to quasars, and 11% of quasars. When visually examining the optical survey cutouts, we noted the presence of close neighbors for the hosts and/or their belonging to known groups or clusters of galaxies. Close neighbors at a distance of less than 50 kpc were found for 39% of radio sources, and 28% of sources are part of groups or clusters of galaxies. Thus, about 70% of gaints are in a fairly dense environment, and this proportion may be higher.",

Within the standard disk-corona model, we assume that protons are accelerated by a non-resonant acceleration mechanism driven by magnetized turbulence in the corona. These accelerated protons interact with ambient radiation or matter, producing high-energy neutrinos and gamma rays. In this scenario, gamma rays are largely absorbed within the corona. The neutrino luminosity depends primarily on the properties of the corona (such as the X-ray luminosity and radius) and the spectral energy distribution of the target photons. This study demonstrates the relation between the neutrino luminosity and the X-ray luminosity, and further discusses the contribution of cascade gamma rays to coronal radiation. Notably, MeV gamma rays can effectively escape the source, together with neutrinos, and serve as key observational probes for testing this model. Future MeV gamma-ray telescopes, such as AMEGO-X and e-ASTROGAM, are expected to detect such gamma-ray signatures, providing a critical multi-messenger test of the hadronic corona model.",

Farrag, A. R. Fazely High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Models describing dark matter as a novel particle often predict that its annihilation or decay into Standard Model particles could produce a detectable neutrino flux in regions of high dark matter density, such as the Galactic Center. In this work, we search for these neutrinos using $\\sim$9 years of IceCube-DeepCore data with an event selection optimized for energies between 15 GeV to 200 GeV. We considered several annihilation and decay channels and dark matter masses ranging from 15 GeV up to 8 TeV. No significant deviation from the background expectation from atmospheric neutrinos and muons was found. The most significant result was found for a dark matter mass of 201.6 GeV annihilating into a pair of $b\\bar{b}$ quarks assuming the Navarro-Frenk-White halo profile with a post-trial significance of $1.08 \\;\\sigma$. We present upper limits on the thermally-averaged annihilation cross-section of the order of $10^{-24} \\mathrm{cm}^3 \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, as well as lower limits on the dark matter decay lifetime up to $10^{26} \\mathrm{s}$ for dark matter masses between 5 GeV up to 8 TeV. These results strengthen the current IceCube limits on dark matter masses above 20 GeV and provide an order of magnitude improvement at lower masses. In addition, they represent the strongest constraints from any neutrino telescope on GeV-scale dark matter and are among the world-leading limits for several dark matter scenarios.",

Vicentin 8 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables. Presented at the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2025), 2025 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The Seyfert Type II galaxy NGC 1068 has been identified as a potential neutrino source by IceCube, with a 4.2$\\sigma $ significance detection of a 79$^{+22}_{-20}$ neutrino excess from 2011 to 2020, despite the absence of a gamma-ray counterpart. The observed high-energy neutrino emission indicates the presence of a hadronic component, along with strong gamma-ray absorption, likely via pair production, and efficient particle acceleration. In this work, we investigate turbulence-driven magnetic reconnection as a mechanism for particle acceleration in the coronal accretion flow surrounding the central black hole. We develop a one-zone model for both acceleration and emission, following the framework of de Gouveia Dal Pino and Lazarian (2005) and Kadowaki et al. (2015) to explore how fast magnetic reconnection in the inner coronal disk region accelerates protons and electrons, shaping the spectral energy distribution (SED). Our model incorporates strong pair production attenuation and interactions with optical, ultraviolet (OUV), and X-ray photon fields in the corona, which serve as effective targets for proton interactions. Unlike recent studies, we find that particle acceleration to the extreme energies required to explain observations is primarily driven by first-order Fermi acceleration within the turbulent reconnection layers in a large scale current sheet, rather than by drift acceleration. Additionally, we demonstrate that accelerated protons primarily lose energy through photopion interactions with the OUV background, subject to important constraints from the coronal X-ray emission.",

The internal structures and properties of those objects are profoundly connected to phenomena such as supernova explosions, gamma-ray bursts, fast radio bursts, high/low-mass compact stars, and even to issues like dark matter and cosmic rays. However, due to the non-perturbative nature of quantum chromodynamics, significant uncertainties remain in our current understanding of the composition and equation of state (EOS) for the dense matter inside them. Drawing on three-flavour symmetry and the strong coupling between light quarks, this paper presents a novel perspective on the nature of pulsars: they are actually composed of strange matter, in the form of either strange quark matter or strangeon (analogous to nucleons and representing multibaryon states with three-flavour symmetry) matter. As both strange quark matter and strangeon matter contain non-zero strangeness, we refer to them collectively as ``strange matter'', and to the corresponding compact stars as ``strange stars''. We then briefly introduce several physical models describing strange matter and present the resulting structures and properties of strange stars. This includes discussions on the EOSs, surface properties, mass-radius relations, glitches, binary compact star mergers, and dark matter. Furthermore, we will explore how observational properties of pulsar-like objects support the strange star model.",

Dzib, Frederic Jaron Accepted to be published in Astronomy & Astrophysics. 5 pages, 1 figure, and 1 table High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The binary star MWC 656 was initially proposed as the first confirmed system composed of a Be star and a black hole. However, recent studies have challenged this interpretation, suggesting that the compact companion is unlikely to be a black hole. In this study, we revisit the nature of MWC 656 by analyzing archival data across multiple wavelengths, including radio observations from the VLA, optical astrometry from the Gaia satellite, and high-energy $\\gamma$-ray data from the Fermi-LAT. Using all available VLA observations at X-band (8.0-12.0 GHz), we produce the deepest radio map toward this system to date, with a noise level of 780 nJy beam$^{-1}$. The source MWC 656 is detected with $S_\\nu=4.6\\pm0.8\\mu$Jy and a spectral index of $\\alpha=1.2\\pm1.8$, derived by sub-band imaging. The radio and X-ray luminosity ratio of MWC 656 is consistent with both the fundamental plane of accreting black holes and with the Güdel-Benz relation for magnetically active stars, leaving the emission mechanism ambiguous. The optical astrometric results of MWC 656 indicate a peculiar velocity of $11.2\\pm2.3$ km s$^{-1}$, discarding it as a runaway star. Its current location, 442 pc below the Galactic plane, implies a vertical travel time incompatible with the lifetime of a B1.5-type star. Moreover, the agreement between observed and expected motion in all three velocity components argues against a deceleration scenario, suggesting that MWC 656 likely formed in situ at high Galactic latitude. We carried out maximum likelihood analysis of Fermi-LAT data, but cannot report a significant detection of $\\gamma$-ray emission from this source. These results reinforce recent evidence that challenge the black hole companion interpretation, and favor a non-BH compact object such as a white dwarf or neutron star.",

Eser, Austin Cummings 30 pages, 12 figures, prepared for submission to PhysReV D High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We investigate the feasibility of detecting extensive air showers via their geo-synchrotron X-ray emission from high-altitude platforms. Starting from first principles, we derive a differential expression for the number of emitted photons per unit grammage and photon energy for an ensemble of gyrating shower electrons. The calculation uses noted parameterizations of the electron state variable distributions in the shower to establish a scale for the photon footprint and, further, takes into account the propagation of emitted photons in the atmosphere. The computed fluxes at the position of the detector are used to estimate the detector acceptance and event rate using a bootstrap Monte Carlo procedure. For a 1 m radius and 70° half-aperture circular detector at an altitude between 20 to 30 km viewing the Earth's limb, we find acceptances at the 1 $\\mathrm{m^2 sr}$ level and integral event rates of roughly 10 per month. These results indicate that X-ray geo-synchrotron emission is a promising, complimentary channel for high-altitude indirect cosmic ray detection in the PeV regime.",

Kirk High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) A major attraction of diffusive shock acceleration is the prediction of power-law spectra for energetic particle distributions. However, this property is not fundamental to the theory. We demonstrate that for planar shocks with an oblique magnetic field the generation of power-law spectra critically requires the particles' scattering rate to be both directly proportional to their gyro radius (Bohm scaling) and spatially uniform. Non-Bohm scaling results in curved spectra at oblique shocks, while abrupt changes in the spatial profile of the scattering upstream introduces spectral breaks. Using the publicly available code Sapphire++, we numerically explore the magnitude of these effects, which are particularly pronounced at fast shocks, as expected in active galactic nuclei and microquasar jets, or young supernova remnants.",

Emission models incorporating different assumptions about cosmic ray diffusion, source distribution, and target gas density are tested using data from neutrino telescopes. In this study, the final all-flavor neutrino dataset, collected over 15 years (2007--2022) by the ANTARES neutrino telescope, is analyzed. A maximum likelihood ratio method built to handle templates of Galactic emission models is employed to evaluate the compatibility of these models with the observed spatial and energy distributions of neutrino events.

Martí Accepted for publication in MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The production sites of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos remain uncertain, though growing evidence suggests a connection to relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei (AGN). We present a detailed analysis of the recent PeV neutrino event KM3-230213A reported by the KM3NeT collaboration, aiming to constrain the physical conditions of its source. Assuming proton acceleration at shocks, we derive the properties of the proton distribution and the energetics required to explain the neutrino emission. Using contemporaneous multiwavelength observations of three AGN flaring candidates within the error region, we examine the plausibility of each of them as the possible counterpart. Our results favor PMN J0606-0724, which exhibits a prominent radio flare coincident with the neutrino arrival. In this framework, the red-giant interaction remains the key driver of baryon injection and shock acceleration, while the dominant external photon field sets the neutrino energy scale: photospheric photons from the red giant yield ~1-10 PeV neutrinos, whereas the ~220 PeV event KM3-230213A is more naturally produced through interactions with colder infrared photons from the dusty torus.",

Ranea-Sandoval, Germán Lugones High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The equation of state of dense matter remains a central challenge in astrophysics and high-energy physics, particularly at supra-nuclear densities where exotic degrees of freedom like hyperons or deconfined quarks are expected to appear. Neutron stars provide a unique natural laboratory to probe this regime. In this work, we present EVA--01, a novel equation of state that provides a unified description of dense matter by incorporating both hadron and quark degrees of freedom within a single relativistic mean-field Lagrangian, from which the equation of state is derived at finite temperature. The model extends the density-dependent formalism by introducing a Polyakov-loop-inspired scalar field to dynamically govern the hadron-quark phase transition, following the approach of chiral mean-field models. The resulting model is consistent with a wide range of theoretical and observational constraints, including those from chiral effective field theory, massive pulsars, gravitational-wave events, and NICER data. We analyze its thermodynamic properties by constructing the QCD phase diagram, identifying the deconfinement, chiral, and nuclear liquid-gas transitions.

      "abstract": "Seeds to success: growing heavy black holes in dense star clusters Lavinia Paiella, Manuel Arca Sedda, Benedetta Mestichelli, Cristiano Ugolini Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The observational dearth of black holes (BHs) with masses between $\\sim$100 and 100,000 $M_\\odot$ raises questions about the nature of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). Proposed formation channels for IMBHs include runaway stellar collisions and repeated binary BH (BBH) mergers driven by dynamical interactions in stellar clusters, but the formation efficiency of these processes and the associated IMBH occupation fraction are largely unconstrained. In this work, we study IMBH formation via both mechanisms in young, globular, and nuclear star clusters. We carry out a comprehensive investigation of IMBH formation efficiency by exploring the impact of different seeding models and star cluster formation histories. We employ a new version of the B-POP population synthesis code, able to model several seeding mechanisms as well as hierarchical BBH mergers. We quantify the efficiency of IMBH production across different cluster families, and estimate the fraction of BBH mergers involving an IMBH primary. Comparison with low-redshift IMBH candidates suggests that, depending on the seeding mechanism, stellar collisions can play a pivotal role in explaining potential IMBHs in local globular clusters. Our simulations highlight stellar collisions as the primary IMBH formation channel across a wide range of cluster types. They further suggest that wandering IMBHs may populate Milky Way-like galaxies and that correlations between cluster and IMBH masses can help distinguish the origins of Galactic globular clusters.",

The radio emission (which is generated by a synchrotron-emitting outflowing electrons) is observed in all spectral state of XRBs. Interestingly, the variations of HEP-tail flux among different spectral states is similar to the variation of radio flux. We motivate to study the HEP-tail in BMC process with an outflowing medium. For this we consider a collimated and conical (of opening angle $\\theta_b$ with axis perpendicular to the accretion disk) outflow geometry. We simulate the BMC spectrum by using a Monte Carlo scheme. We find that the emergent spectrum has power-law tail (of photon index $\\Gamma$ $>$ 2 and with high energy cut-off $E_{c}$ $>$ 200 keV) only for $\\theta_b$ greater than $\\sim$30 degrees in conical outflow, while for a collimated or a conical outflow ($\\theta_b$ $<$ 30 degrees) these HEP-tail can be only generated when it is also found in thermal Comptonized spectra (i.e., at sufficiently high Comptonizing medium temperature). These results are approximately consistent with analytically derived expressions. We describe the observed GRS 1915+105 spectrum for two classes $\\chi$ and $\\gamma$ in conical outflow, for this the outflow speed is highly relativistic and the kinetic power of wind suggest that the HEP-tail can be generated at inner region of the accretion disk, like inner disk radio emission.",

Berdyugina 9 pages, 10 figures, published in Astronomy & Astrophysics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present simultaneous high-precision optical polarimetric and near-infrared (NIR) to ultraviolet (UV) photometric observations of low-mass black hole X-ray binary A0620-00 in the quiescent state. Subtracting interstellar polarization, estimated from a sample of field stars, we derive the intrinsic polarization of A0620-00. We show that the intrinsic polarization degree (PD) is variable with the orbital period with the amplitude of $\\sim0.3\\%$ at least in the $R$ band, where the signal-to-noise ratio of our observations is the best. This implies that some fraction of the optical polarization is produced by a scattering of stellar radiation off the matter that follows the black hole in its orbital motion. In addition, we see a rotation of the orbit-average intrinsic polarization angle (PA) with the wavelength from $163°$ in the $R$ to $177°$ in the $B$ band. All of the above, combined with the historical NIR-to-optical polarimetric observations, demonstrates the complex behavior of the average intrinsic polarization of A0620-00: the PA continuously rotates from the infrared to the blue band by $\\sim53°$ in total, while the PD of $\\sim1\\%$ remains nearly constant over the entire spectral range. The spectral dependence of the PA can be described by Faraday rotation with the rotation measure of RM=$-0.2$ rad $\\mu$m$^{-2}$, implying a few Gauss magnetic field in the plasma surrounding the black hole accretion disk. However, our preferred interpretation of the peculiar wavelength dependence is an interplay between two polarized components with different PAs. Polarimetric measurements in the UV range can help in distinguishing between these scenarios.",

Wind is inevitable in LLAGNs, mainly interpreted in an indirect way, also the evidence is growing for the presence of wind in the outer thin disk. We present a hydrodynamics (HD) model for wind from the outer thin disk, where the main driver is the inner disk irradiation (which is parameterized by a number $x$ in hydrostatic equilibrium equation) and the heating mechanism is photoionization. The model works for low-intensity irradiation or from a height $z_s$ in the optically thin medium. We solve the model equations in cylindrical coordinates along the $z$-axis for a given radius $r$ with assuming a tiny vertical speed $v_z$ ($\\ll c_s$ sound speed). The sonic point conditions assure an isobaric regime above the sonic height ($z^{max}$); in addition to the height $z_f (\\ll z^{max}$), the radial pressure gradient also supports the fluid rotation, and both jointly assure a wind ejection from the $z^{max}$ with fluid speed. The $z^{max}$ increases with $x$, and beyond a large $z^{max}$ (say $z^{max}_t$ corresponding to maximum $x$), there is no physical solution. We start the computation from the outer radius $r_o^{thin}$ to the inner $r_{in}^{thin}$ with a Bondi mass accretion rate $\\dot{M}_{Bondi}$, to explore the $r$ dependency of the mass inflow rate $\\dot{M}$ and wind properties. We constrain the model by fixing $\\dot{M}$ at $r_{in}^{thin}$ from the observations of NGC 1097 and check the feasibility of the model by comparing the energetics with the observed bolometric luminosity. The wind is an equatorial with a viewing angle $i>85$ degrees and capable to generate red/blueshifted lines, which would be a general characteristics for LLAGNs.",

Voitsik High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) High-energy astrophysical neutrinos serve as crucial messengers for understanding hadronic acceleration processes and identifying the origins of cosmic rays, with blazars among the most promising neutrino sources. The KM3NeT experiment reported the detection of an ultra-high-energy neutrino with an energy estimate of ~ 220 PeV, the most energetic yet observed. The neutrino arrival direction has a 99% confidence region of 3° radius centered at RA 94.3°, Dec -7.8° (J2000). In this work, seventeen candidate blazars located within this region are identified. Comprehensive new observations and archival data analysis for these sources are presented. The study provides a complete multiwavelength coverage across radio, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray bands, including proprietary data and dedicated follow-up observations. This study highlights flaring behavior in several candidate counterparts. One object exhibits a radio flare coinciding with the neutrino arrival time, with a pre-trial chance probability of 0.26%. Another candidate displays a rising trend in X-ray flux in a one-year window around the neutrino arrival time, while a third undergoes a gamma-ray flare during the same period. Based on the observational findings here presented, while none of these candidates can conclusively be linked to the neutrino, the implications of a possible blazar origin for the KM3NeT event are discussed.",

These systems, colloquially known as \"spiders,\" consist of neutron stars in tight orbits with low-mass companions, which are gradually ablated by the pulsar wind. SpiderCat includes both primary subclasses $-$ redbacks and black widows $-$ distinguished by companion mass, as well as candidates and peculiar systems such as transitional, huntsman and tidarren MSPs. As of this initial release, SpiderCat contains 111 entries: 30 redbacks, 50 black widows, two huntsmans, 23 redback candidates, five black widow candidates, and one huntsman candidate. In this paper, we compile and summarize key parameters for each system, including spin and orbital properties, and multiwavelength data from radio, optical, X-ray, and $\\gamma$-ray observations. An interactive, publicly accessible web interface, at this https URL, enables exploration and visualization of the data. The rapid growth of the number of known spiders, accelerated by the Fermi Large Area Telescope survey and its ability to identify MSPs in $\\gamma$-rays, has opened the door to population-level studies. Utilizing SpiderCat, we analyze trends in spin period, orbital period, companion mass, emission properties, and spatial distribution. SpiderCat serves as a dynamic, multiwavelength repository for this unique class of binary pulsars, facilitating new discoveries and constraints on pulsar evolution, particle acceleration, and the neutron star equation of state.",

As a result, they may play an important cosmological role and provide a unique probe of the early universe. A PBH with an initial mass of approximately $10^{15}$~g is expected to explode today in a final burst of Hawking radiation. In this work, we conduct an all-sky search for individual PBH burst events using the data collected from March 2021 to July 2024 by the Water Cherenkov Detector Array of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Three PBH burst durations, 10~s, 20~s, and 100~s, are searched, with no significant PBH bursts observed. The upper limit on the local PBH burst rate density is set to be as low as 181~pc$^{-3}$~yr$^{-1}$ at 99$\\%$ confidence level, representing the most stringent limit achieved to date.",

We develop a semi-analytical framework in which turbulence is modeled as a stochastic velocity field acting through a modified drag force. We integrate the resulting stochastic differential equations both in Cartesian coordinates and in orbital elements using a linearized perturbative approach, and compare these results with full numerical simulations. Eccentricity and inclination evolve toward steady-state Rayleigh distributions, with variances determined by the local disk properties and the ratio of the gas damping rate to the orbital frequency. The analytical predictions agree well with the numerical simulations. We provide closed-form expressions for the variances in both the fast and slow damping regimes. These results are directly applicable to Monte Carlo population models and can serve as physically motivated initial conditions for hydrodynamical simulations. Turbulent forcing prevents full circularization and alignment of BH orbits in AGN disks, even in the presence of strong gas drag. This has important implications for BH merger and binary formation rates, which are sensitive to the residual eccentricity and inclination. Our results highlight the need to account for turbulence-induced stochastic heating when modeling the dynamical evolution of compact objects in AGN environments.",

Moriya 18 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables, accepted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Type Ia-CSM supernovae (SNe) are a rare and peculiar subclass of thermonuclear SNe characterized by emission lines of hydrogen or helium, indicative of a high-density circumstellar medium (CSM). Their implied mass-loss rates of $\\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-1}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (assuming $\\mathrm{ \\sim 100 \\ km\\ s^{-1}}$ winds) from optical observations are generally in excess of values observed in realistic SN Ia progenitors. In this paper, we present an independent study of CSM densities around a sample of 29 archival Ia-CSM SNe using radio observations with the Very Large Array at 6 GHz. Motivated by the late ($\\sim$2 yr) radio detection of the Ia-CSM SN 2020eyj, we observed old ($>$1 yr) SNe where we are more likely to see the emergent synchrotron emission that may have been suppressed earlier by free-free absorption by the CSM. We do not detect radio emission down to 3$\\sigma$ limits of $\\sim$35 $\\mu$Jy in our sample. The only radio-detected candidate in our sample, SN 2022esa, was likely mis-classified as a Ia-CSM with early spectra, and appears more consistent with a peculiar Ic based on later-epochs. Assuming a wind-like CSM with temperatures between $2 \\times 10^4$ K and $10^5$ K, and magnetic field-to-shock energy fraction ($\\epsilon_B$) = $0.01-0.1$, the radio upper limits rule out mass-loss rates between $\\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-2}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (100 km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$. This is somewhat in tension with the estimates from optical observations, and may indicate that more complex CSM geometries and/or lower values of $\\epsilon_B$ may be present.",

Powerful relativistic jets drill through the stellar envelope before the gamma emission. Previous hydrodynamical studies imposed jets artificially, neglecting accretion dynamics, while the central engine simulations have reproduced jet launching via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism focusing on the inner core regions. However, both the central engine and the progenitor structure are crucial to determining the jet's evolution.

The setup assumes a Kerr black hole with spin $a \\sim 0.9$ in the centre of three progenitor models, varying the magnetic-field strength and geometry. Relativistic jets are successfully launched by a strong dipolar magnetic field ($B_0 \\gtrsim 10^{12}$-$10^{14}$~G) from magnetically arrested disks.

Accepted to ApJ. This version aligns with the accepted one, where the Discussion has been updated and expanded High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The rotational evolution of a strongly magnetized neutron star (NS), accreting or isolated, is driven by external torques of different nature. In addition to the torques, even the tiniest deformations of the NS crust can affect its rotation through asymmetries in its inertia tensor. Several factors may be responsible for the deformations, including strong magnetic fields, internal stresses, or local heating. The main effect produced by the deformations is the so-called free precession: the motion of the rotational axis with respect to the crust. We consider the evolution of a triaxially deformed isolated NS with a strong dipolar magnetic field for a broad range of parameters, taking into account the magnetic field decay. We show that the combination of pulsar torques and free precession results in a considerable broadening of the distribution of magnetic obliquity angles (the angle between the magnetic and rotational axes) and creates a population of objects where the rotational axis does not align with the magnetic axis at all but enters a limit-cycle regime. The combination of free precession and magnetic torques can also explain the observed distribution in pulsar braking indices by creating a periodic oscillation in the magnetic obliquity.",

In this paper, we focus on GRB 110213A that shows double-peaked optical afterglow lightcurves and the shallow decay feature of the X-ray afterglow. We adopt a semi-analytic model for the dynamics of forward and reverse shocks generated through an interaction between an arbitrary magnetized ejecta with a finite thickness and a stratified circumstellar medium. Multiwavelength radiation from forward and reverse shocks seen from an arbitrary viewing angle is calculated under a thin-shell approximation. Our analysis with multimodal nested sampling methods for GRB 110213A suggests that the thick shell ejecta naturally explains the shallow decay feature of the X-ray afterglow. The combination of the reverse shock emission in the strongly magnetized jet and forward shock emission in the weakly magnetized circumstellar medium makes the double peak feature of the optical afterglows. The estimated low radiative efficiency in the prompt phase may be a consequence of the high magnetization of the jet in this case. A multi-messenger emission simulator based on the magnetic bullet afterglow model is publicly available as the open source Julia package \"Magglow\".",

In this work, we report the first radio detection of a SN Ibn, SN 2023fyq, and characterize the mass-loss history of its stellar progenitor using the radio and X-ray observations obtained over 18 months post-explosion. We find that the radio emission from 58--185 days is best modeled by synchrotron radiation attenuated by free-free absorption from a CSM of density $\\sim$ $10^{-18}$ g/$\\rm{cm^{3}}$ ($\\sim 10^{6} \\mathrm{\\rho_{ISM}}$) at a radius of $10^{16}$ cm, corresponding to a mass-loss rate of $\\sim$ $4 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{M_{\\odot} \\ yr^{-1}}$ (for a wind velocity of 1700 km/s from optical spectroscopy) from 0.7 to 3 years before the explosion. This timescale is consistent with the time frame over which pre-explosion optical outbursts were observed. However, our late-time observations at 525 days post-explosion yield non-detections, and the 3$\\sigma$ upper limits (along with an X-ray non-detection) allow us to infer lower-density CSM at $2\\times 10^{16}$ cm with $\\rm{\\dot{M}}$ $< 2.5\\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{M_{\\odot} \\ yr^{-1}}$. These results suggest a shell-like CSM from at most $4 \\times 10^{15}$ to $2 \\times 10^{16}$ cm ($\\sim 10^{5} R_{\\rm{\\odot}}$) with an elevated CSM density (0.004 $\\mathrm{M_{\\odot} \\ yr^{-1}}$) that is roughly consistent with predictions from a merger model for this object. Future radio observations of a larger sample of SNe Ibn will provide key details on the extent and density of their helium-rich CSM.",

Barkov 9 pages, 7 figures, abstract abridged, to be published in Astronomy and Astrophysics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) LS 5039 hosts a high-mass star, and a compact object that might be a strongly magnetized neutron star (NS). This scenario requires a mechanism to power its persistent and strong nonthermal emission. We investigate a mechanism in which the nonsteady interaction structure of the stellar and the NS winds can regularly excite NS magnetospheric activity, releasing extra energy and fueling the source nonthermal emission. The NS wind shocked by the stellar wind can recurrently touch the NS magnetosphere, triggering magnetic instabilities whose growth can release extra energy into the NS wind in a cyclic manner. To illustrate and study the impact of these cycles on the two-wind interaction structure on different scales, we performed relativistic hydrodynamics simulations in 2D and 3D with periods of an enhanced power in the NS wind along the orbit. We also used analytical tools to characterize processes near the NS relevant for the nonthermal emission. As the NS wind termination shock touches the magnetosphere energy dissipation occurs, but the whole shocked two-wind structure is eventually driven away halting the extra energy injection. However, due to the corresponding drop in the NS wind ram pressure, the termination shock propagates back toward the magnetosphere, resuming the process. These activity cycles excite strong waves in the shocked flows, intensifying their mixing and the disruption of their spiral-like structure produced by orbital motion. Further downstream, the shocked winds can become a quasi-stable, relatively smooth flow. The recurrent interaction between the NS magnetosphere and shocked wind can fuel a relativistic outflow powerful enough to explain the nonthermal emission of LS 5039. A magnetospheric multipolar magnetic field much stronger than the dipolar one may provide the required energetics, and help to explain the lack of evidence of a recent supernova remnant.",

We aim to investigate how jet magnetization and other physical parameters influence the development of instabilities beyond the first recollimation shock. In particular, we focus on identifying the conditions under which the centrifugal instability (CFI) is effective. We perform high-resolution 2D and 3D simulations using the relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code PLUTO. The jets are initialized with a conical geometry and propagate into an ambient medium, and we follow by axisymmetric simulations how they evolve towards a steady-state. In 2D we explore a range of magnetizations (from 0 to 1), pressure contrasts, and inertia ratios to characterize the formation and evolution of recollimation shocks. The results are further evaluated using linear stability analysis to assess the growth and suppression of CFI. Finally, we perform 3D simulations of unstable and stable jets. We discuss how the different parameters of the axisymmetric steady solutions influence the location and strength of recollimation. We find that, even in moderately magnetized jets, $\\sigma$=0.1, the CFI can still develop under suitable local conditions and disrupt the jet structure. This instability is governed by the jet radius, curvature, Lorentz factor, and magnetization, and is not always predictable from injection conditions. While magnetization can delay or locally suppress instability growth, it does not guarantee long-term jet stability. Our 3D results highlight the limitations of 2D models in capturing non-axisymmetric and nonlinear effects, and underline the complex interplay between magnetic confinement and destabilizing mechanisms. These findings have implications for interpreting variability, and polarization structure in AGN jets.",

      "abstract": "Revisiting the Radio Lateral Distribution Function: An amplitude dependence on $X_{\\rm max}$ and primary composition Washington R. Carvalho Jr., Lech Wiktor Piotrowski High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We show that there is a strong dependence of the radio LDF electric field amplitudes at ground level on the position of $X_{\\rm max}$ in the atmosphere, even accounting for differences in the EM energy of the showers. Since an $X_{\\rm max}$ dependence leads to a primary composition dependence, this implies that information on the mass composition is encoded not only in the LDF shape but also in its amplitude. This $X_{\\rm max}$ dependence can be explained in terms of two competing scalings of the measured electric field: One goes with $(1/\\rho)^J$, where $\\rho$ is the air density at $X_{\\rm max}$ and $J$ is a zenith dependent non-linearity factor describing coherence loss. This density scaling tends to decrease the geomagnetic emission of deeper showers. The other scaling goes with $(1/R)$, where $R$ is the distance from $X_{\\rm max}$ to the core at ground, and instead increases the measured electric field of deeper showers. At low zenith angles, the $(1/R)$ scaling is stronger and leads to larger measured electric fields as $X_{\\rm max}$ increases. The picture at higher zeniths, i.e., lower densities, is more nuanced. In this region, the deflections due to the Lorentz force are much larger and introduce extra time delays between the particle tracks, decreasing the coherence of the emission. This loss of coherence is highly dependent on the strength of the geomagnetic field and can slow down, or even reverse the increase of the radio emission with decreasing air density. This strong, yet historically overlooked LDF amplitude dependence on $X_{\\rm max}$/composition could be used to directly infer, even bypassing any $X_{\\rm max}$ reconstruction, the cosmic ray primary composition on an event-by-event basis. It could also have some repercussions on other radio reconstruction methods, such as a possible $X_{\\rm max}$/composition bias on shower electromagnetic energy reconstruction methods.",

Comments welcome Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) While relativistic magnetic reconnection in pair plasmas has emerged in recent years as a candidate for the origin of radiation from extreme astrophysical environments, the corresponding subrelativistic pair plasma regime has remained less explored, leaving open the question of how relativistic physics affects reconnection. In this paper, we investigate the differences between these regimes by contrasting 2D particle-in-cell simulations of reconnection in pair plasmas with relativistic magnetization ($\\sigma \\gg 1$) and subrelativistic magnetization ($\\sigma < 1$). By utilizing unprecedentedly large domain sizes and outflow boundary conditions, we demonstrate that lowering the magnetization results in a change in the reconnection geometry from a plasmoid chain to a Petschek geometry, where laminar exhausts bounded by slow-mode shocks emanate from a single diffusion region. We attribute this change to the reduced plasmoid production rate in the low-$\\sigma$ case: when the secondary tearing rate is sufficiently low, plasmoids are too few in number to prevent the system from relaxing into a stable Petschek configuration. This geometric change also affects particle energization: we show that while high-$\\sigma$ plasmoid chains generate power-law energy spectra, low-$\\sigma$ Petschek exhausts merely heat incoming plasma and yield negligible nonthermal acceleration.

Movies will become available in the journal once published Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) are transients associated with mass ejection during stellar mergers and common envelope evolution (CEE). LRNe have the potential to illuminate the poorly understood phases of binary evolution leading up to the CEE, during the mass ejection phase, and in the immediate aftermath. However, the mechanism responsible for powering LRN light curves and the origin of their observed diversity remain open questions. Here, we perform two-dimensional moving-mesh radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of LRNe that take into account hydrogen and helium recombination and relevant opacities. We study a typical high-mass stellar merger, which dynamically ejects 2 $M_\\odot$ with a characteristic velocity of 410 km/s. This ejecta collides with 2.7 $M_\\odot$ of equatorially concentrated circumbinary material (CBM) left behind from a prior phase of non-conservative runaway mass transfer. We find that the resulting light curve is composed of a short, blue peak followed by a redder, predominantly shock-powered plateau with luminosities reaching up to $10^{41}$ erg/s and durations up to 200 days. These luminosities are significantly higher, and the durations much longer, than those produced by a simple spherical ejection of the same mass. They also depend in a complex way on the radial distribution of the CBM and the viewing angle. The shock is embedded in the ejecta and its observational signatures during the optically-thick phase are largely hidden. Our results are broadly compatible with observations of the brightest extragalactic LRNe and pave the way for the transformation of LRNe into powerful probes of binary evolution.",

Perets Accepted in MNRAS, comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Globular clusters host complex stellar populations whose chemical signatures suggest early (3 Myr - 1 Gyr) retention and reprocessing of stellar ejecta, yet direct evidence for intracluster gas is lacking. Here we present a unified theoretical framework for the evolution of gas in young globular clusters, and its implications for the production of multiple stellar populations. We show that low-velocity AGB winds are gravitationally retained in clusters more massive than a few 10^5 MSun. In addition, AGB winds in such clusters collide with each other and the previously retained winds, triggering a rapid `switch' to efficient gas retention. Expected gas retention fractions agree well with the observed second population fractions in Galactic globular clusters. Furthermore, the accumulated gas cannot form new stars because protostellar cores are disrupted by encounters with pre-existing stars. Instead, the gas is accreted onto pre-existing main-sequence stars and compact objects. Time-dependent core-halo models indicate that compact objects can grow and collapse within 100 Myr - 1 Gyr, while lower-mass main-sequence stars can be `rejuvenated' into the 4 - 6 MSun range required to reproduce key abundance patterns. Therefore, in our model, the multiple populations will be found in sufficiently massive clusters, with the second-population stars being formed from the inner subset of first-population stars that accreted large fractions of their mass from the AGB-processed retained gas. Finally, we argue that a combination of feedback processes, including accretion luminosity onto compact objects, novae, pulsar winds, and binary supernovae, will clear the gas by 1 Gyr, thus reproducing the gas-poor conditions observed for present-day clusters.",

Wu 19 pages, 15 figures, submitted to A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present optical observations of the Type IIb supernova (SN) 2017ckj, covering approximately 180 days after the explosion. Its early-time multi-band light curves display no clear evidence of a shock-cooling tail, resembling the behavior of SN2008ax. The $V$-band light curve exhibits a short rise time of about 5 days and reaches an absolute fitted peak magnitude of $M_{\\rm V}=-18.49\\pm0.18\\mathrm{mag}$. The late-time multi-band light curves reveal a linear decline. We modelled the bolometric light curve of SN2017ckj to constrain the progenitor and the explosion parameters. We estimated a total mass of $\\rm ^{56}Ni$ synthesized by SN2017ckj of $M_{\\rm Ni} = 0.21^{+0.05}_{-0.03}\\ M_\\odot$, with a massive H-rich envelope of $M_{\\rm env} = 0.4^{+0.1}_{-0.1}\\ M_\\odot$. Both the $\\rm ^{56}Ni$ mass and the envelope mass of SN2017ckj are higher than those of typical SNe IIb, in agreement with its peculiar light curve evolution. The early-time spectra of SN2017ckj are dominated by a blue continuum, accompanied by narrow $\\rm H_\\alpha$ and \\Heii emission lines. The earliest spectrum exhibits flash ionization features, from which we estimated a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\\sim 3\\times10^{-4}M_\\odot \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. At later epochs, the spectra develop broad P-Cygni profiles and become increasingly similar to those of SNe IIb, especially SN2018gk. The late-time spectrum at around 139 days does not show a distinct decline in the strength of $\\rm H_\\alpha$ emission profile, also indicating a relatively massive envelope of its progenitor. Aside from the $\\rm H_\\alpha$ feature, the nebular spectrum exhibits prominent emission lines of \\Oi, \\Caii, [\\Caii], and \\Mgi], which are consistent with the prototypical SN1993J.",

Simons 29 pages, 28 Figures, submitted to ApJ. Comments Welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Atomic Hydrogen (HI) is an important component of gas in and around galaxies and forms extended disk-like structures well beyond the extent of starlight. Here we investigate the properties and evolution of extended HI disks that emerge in six Milky Way-mass galaxies using cosmological zoom-in simulations from the Figuring Out Gas & Galaxies in Enzo (FOGGIE) suite. We focus on the formation, evolution, and morphology of extended gaseous disks that emerge in all six systems. We find that median HI column densities drop sharply at the disk edge, with mean column densities outside the disk dominated by dense (NHI~10^19 cm-2), clumpy structures. All systems have significant misaligned features (warps or polar rings) at some point in their evolution; however, their frequencies, lifetimes, and origins vary significantly. We find that the morphology of the FOGGIE disks are correlated with properties of their Circumgalactic Medium (CGM). We classify these systems into two broad categories: those with CGMs that are Less Populated with HI and those with CGMs that are More Populated with HI. Both categories kinematically settle by z=0, but the Less Populated systems all form thin disks by z=0, while the More Populated systems do not. This classification is independent of disk and halo mass, implying the formation of a thin disk is influenced by local environmental factors. Our results indicate a connection between CGM content and disk formation that is not yet fully understood. A second paper investigates observational aspects of these structures.",

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Atomic Hydrogen (HI) is a useful tracer of gas in and around galaxies, and can be found in extended disk-like structures well beyond a system's optical extent. Here we investigate the properties of extended HI disks that emerge in six Milky Way-mass galaxies using cosmological zoom-in simulations from the Figuring Out Gas & Galaxies in Enzo (FOGGIE) suite. This paper focuses on the observability of the extended HI in these systems. We find overall agreement with observational constraints on the HI size-mass relation. To facilitate direct comparisons with observations, we present synthetic HI 21-cm emission cubes. By spatially filtering our synthetic cubes to mimic the absence of short baselines in interferometric maps, we find that such observations can miss ~10-40% of diffuse emission, which preferentially removes low column density, low velocity dispersion gas outside the central disk. The amount of observable material depends strongly on its distribution and the system's observed orientation, preventing the formulation of a simple correction factor. Therefore, to fully characterize extended disks, their circumgalactic mediums, and the interfaces between them, dual convolutions including data from interferometers and large single-dish radio telescopes are required.",

However, its mass distribution across the virial phase and the cooler, denser atomic phase, remains uncertain. To investigate this, we perform high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations of 0.125--8 kpc-scale representative patches of the CGM, with parameters informed by quasar absorption line observations. Our simulations resolve the cooling length (the minimum across all temperatures of $c_s t_{\\rm cool}$, where $c_s$ is the sound speed and $t_{\\rm cool}$ is the cooling time in isobaric conditions), allowing us to track the evolution of cold gas more accurately. We find that low-density CGM gas ($3\\times10^{-4}$ cm$^{-3}$) cannot sustain cold gas below $10^4$ K for long, due to a large value of the ratio between the cooling to mixing time ($t_{\\rm cool}/t_{\\rm mix}$). In contrast, higher-density environments ($3\\times10^{-3}~{\\rm cm}^{-3}$) reach a turbulent multiphase steady state, with up to $50\\%$ of the mass in the cold phase, occupying only about $1\\%$ of the volume. To connect with large-volume cosmological simulations and small ${\\rm pc}$-scale idealized simulations, we explore different box sizes (0.125--8 kpc) and identify a key scaling relation: simulations with similar $t_{\\rm cool}/t_{\\rm mix}$ exhibit comparable cold gas mass fractions and lifetimes. Importantly, we find that simply sub-sampling (reducing box-size) a small region from a large-volume simulation while maintaining a constant turbulent energy density injection rate from larger to smaller scales artificially shortens $t_\\mathrm{mix}$, leading to inaccurate predictions for cold gas survival. This means that cold gas at small $\\lesssim 10$ kpc scales arises in relatively dense, quiescent regions of the CGM rather than the turbulent ones undergoing cascade from large scales.",

Aragon-Calvo, Rien van de Weygaert, Sergey Kotov, Jacqueline van Gorkom 15 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables. Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Accretion of metal-poor gas is expected to be an important channel of gas replenishment in galaxy evolution studies. However, observational evidence of this process is still relatively scarce. The unusual polar disk galaxy VGS 12 was found in the Void Galaxy Survey. It appears to be isolated and resides in the cosmological wall between two large voids. The suggested formation scenario for this peculiar system is accretion of metal-poor gas from the void interior. We present the data on the gas-phase chemical abundance of VGS 12 obtained with the Russian 6m telescope BTA. We complement our analysis with HI data obtained with VLA and the data on the kinematics of the ionized gas. VGS 12 appears to be a strong outlier from the \"metallicity - luminosity\" relation, with gas oxygen abundance ~0.7dex lower than expected for its luminosity. The nitrogen abundance, on the other hand, is higher than what is typically observed in galaxies with similar metallicity, but is consistent with the metallicity expected given its luminosity. Such behavior is what is expected in the case of metal-poor gas accretion. The HI reveals clear morphological and kinematical asymmetry between the northern and southern parts of the disk, which are likely related to its unsettled state due to the recent accretion event. The kinematics of the ionized gas seen in Halpha reveal prolate rotation and follow closely the rotation of the HI disk, so we suggest this is accreted HI gas ionized by the stars in the central region of the galaxy. Together, our findings provide strong, multiwavelength evidence of ongoing cold gas accretion in a galaxy caught in the act of growing from the cosmic web. This is one of the very few individual galaxies where a convincing case can be made for such a process, and demonstrates the potential for cold accretion to contribute to galaxy growth even in the low-redshift universe.",

Rodrigues, N. G. de Isídio, A. E. Araújo-Carvalho Submitted to Astrophysical Journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The structure, extent, and mass of the Milky Way's (MW) dark matter (DM) halo are observationally challenging to determine due to our position within the Galaxy. To overcome this limitation, we study a combined sample of 127 MW analogs from the IllustrisTNG-50 cosmological simulation with observations of 11 nearby galaxies. Using both spatial and spectral high-resolution data from VLA and GMRT telescopes, we employ the 3D-Barolo algorithm to derive precise kinematic maps and rotation curves (RCs). To perform a careful analysis of the stellar component, we use Spitzer mid-IR imaging at 3.6 and 4.5um. We decompose the RCs into their different mass components, enabling the construction of a DM radial profile for each galaxy. By using a MCMC-based routine, we account for the DM contribution for the observed RCs. For our simulated sample, we obtain DM radial profiles directly from the TNG50 database. We probe for the universality of the DM profiles by deriving and comparing the equivalent local DM density (LDMD), a critical parameter linked to DM direct detection experiments on Earth. We calculate the DM density at the corresponding location of the Sun in each of the analogs. Our analysis yields a final LDMD range of 0.17-0.46 GeV cm^-3. Finally, by leveraging our mass estimates (M200}, Mgas and Mstar), we contextualize our findings with the efficiency of star formation in MW analogs and with the diversity of galaxies inhabiting similar halo masses.",

Daniel Wang, Gwenllian M. Williams, Suinan Zhang 23 pages, 11 figures, Accepted to The Astrophysical Journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The circumnuclear region of the Galactic Center offers a unique laboratory to study energy balance and structure formation around Sgr A$\\star$. This work investigates thermal and nonthermal processes within 7 pc distance from Sgr A$\\star$. Using MeerKAT 1.3 GHz radio continuum data and ALMA H40 radio recombination line emission from the ACES survey, we separate free-free and synchrotron components at $\\sim$0.2 pc resolution. With a thermal fraction of $\\simeq$13%, the 1.3 GHz emission shows tight correlations with the Herschel PACS infrared data. The correlation between the equipartition magnetic field and molecular gas traced by JCMT $^{12}$CO (J=3$\\rightarrow$2) observations reveals a balance between the magnetic field, cosmic rays, and molecular gas pressures south of the circumnuclear disk on $\\sim$0.7 pc scales. Unlike the magnetic field and ionized gas, the molecular gas density declines in the cavity (R$\\leq$2 pc) toward the center, likely due to feedback from Sgr A$\\star$. We find that nonthermal pressure from turbulent gas nearly balances magnetic and cosmic ray pressures and exceeds thermal pressure by two orders of magnitude. The medium surrounding Sgr A$\\star$ is filled by a low-$\\beta$ (thermal-to-magnetic energy), supersonic plasma, with an Alfvén Mach number $\\simeq$ 4 (assuming equipartition). Analysis of the mass-to-magnetic flux ratio suggests that the circumnuclear region is mostly subcritical and, therefore, the magnetic field can help stabilize gas clouds against gravitational collapse.",

Submitted to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present an analysis of the gas-phase mass-metallicity relationship (MZR) and fundamental metallicity relationship (FMR) for $65$ star-forming galaxies at $2 < z < 8$ from the JWST/EXCELS survey. We calculate gas-phase metallicities (12 + log(O/H)) using strong-line calibrations explicitly tested against the EXCELS sample, and report direct-method metallicities for $25$ galaxies. Our sample spans $8.1<\\log(\\rm M_\\star/M_\\odot)<10.3$ in stellar mass and $0<\\log(\\rm SFR/M_\\odot \\, yr^{-1})<2$ in star-formation rate, consistent with typical main-sequence star-forming galaxies at the same redshifts. We find a clear MZR at both $2<z<4$ ($\\langle z \\rangle = 3.2$) and $4<z<8$ ($\\langle z \\rangle = 5.5$), with consistent slopes and mild evolution in normalization of $\\simeq 0.1 \\, \\mathrm{dex}$, matching trends from simulations and recent observations. Our results demonstrate rapid gas-phase enrichment in the early Universe, with galaxies at fixed mass reaching $\\simeq 50$ per cent of their present-day metallicity by $z \\simeq 3$ (within the first $\\simeq 15$ per cent of cosmic time). We find tentative evidence for SFR-dependence in the MZR scatter, though the results remain inconclusive and highlight the need for larger high-redshift samples. Comparison with locally derived FMRs reveals a clear offset consistent with other $z > 3$ studies. We discuss potential drivers of this offset, noting that high-redshift samples have significantly different physical properties compared to local samples used to define the $z=0$ FMR. Our results confirm that low-mass, high specific star-formation rate galaxies common at high redshift are inconsistent with the equilibrium conditions underlying the local FMR, and highlight the rapid chemical enrichment at early cosmic epochs.",

Burton Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Observations of HI published in 1957 by Westerhout and Schmidt were presented as showing a global face-on view of spiral structure in the Milky Way. Since then many studies have attempted to improve on the early map, perhaps presupposing our Galaxy to be characterized by a Grand-design pattern of prominent spiral arms. We consider here two approaches to explore the nature of spiral structure of the inner Milky Way disk using the HI4PI survey. The first is to search for shallow shoulders in the high-velocity wings of HI data along the Galactic equatorial disk of the inner Milky Way that would be expected if the lines of sight swept across interarm regions of low HI density. The second is to look for broad dips in the integrated HI brightness temperature over the high-velocity wings, pertaining to gas near the subcentral region, that would be expected for the interarm region of a Grand-design. We find neither shallow shoulders nor broad dips in either the Northern quadrant I or the Southern quadrant IV indicating that the Milky Way seen interior to the Solar orbit is not characterized by a majestic spiral-structure Grand-design; this conclusion is a robust one, in that it does not depend on measures of distance. Taken together with decades of work on the bits and pieces of the quite disorganized shambles of the inner Galaxy, we suggest that the Milky Way belongs to the category of Flocculent spirals.",

Cuppen 16 pages, 8 figures, submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics, comments are welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Astrochemical models are essential to bridge the gap between the timescales of reactions, experiments, and observations. Ice chemistry in these models experiences a large computational complexity as a result of the many parameters required for the modeling of chemistry occurring on these ices, such as binding energies and reaction energy barriers. Many of these parameters are poorly constrained, and accurately determining all would be too costly. We aim to find out which parameters describing ice chemistry have a large effect on the calculated abundances of ices for different prestellar objects. Using Monte Carlo sampled binding energies, diffusion barriers, desorption and diffusion prefactors, and reaction energy barriers, we determined the sensitivity of the abundances of the main ice species calculated with UCLCHEM, an astrochemical modeling code, on each of these parameters. We do this for a large grid of physical conditions across temperature, density, cosmic ray ionization rate and UV field strength. We find that, regardless of the physical conditions, the main sensitivities of abundances of the main ice species are the diffusion barriers of small and relatively mobile reactive species such as H, N, O, HCO, and CH$_3$. Thus, these parameters should be determined more accurately to increase the accuracy of models, paving the way to a better understanding of observations of ices. In many cases, accurate reaction energy barriers are not essential due to the treatment of competition between reactions and diffusion.",

Submitted to A&A, comments welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We study the formation and evolution of stellar halos (SHs) around bright central galaxies (BCGs), focusing on their scaling relations, colors, and metallicities across cosmic time, and compare model predictions with ultra--deep imaging data. We use the semianalytic model \\textsc{FEGA25}, applied to merger trees from high--resolution dark matter simulations, including an updated treatment of intracluster light (ICL) formation. SHs are defined as the stellar component within the transition radius, linked to halo concentration. Predictions are compared with observations from the VST Early-type GAlaxy Survey (VEGAS) and Fornax Deep Survey (FDS). The SH mass correlates strongly with both BCG and ICL masses, with tighter scatter in the SH--ICL relation. The transition radius peaks at 30--40 kpc nearly independent of redshift, but can reach $\\sim400$ kpc in the most massive halos, after z=0.5. SHs and ICL show nearly identical color distributions at all epochs, both reddening toward $z=0$. At $z=2$, SHs and the ICL are $\\sim0.4$ dex more metal--poor than BCGs, but the gap shrinks to $\\sim0.1$ dex by the present time. Observed colors are consistent with model predictions, while observed metallicities are lower, suggesting a larger contribution from disrupted dwarfs. SHs emerge as transition regions between BCGs and the ICL, dynamically and chemically coupled to both. Their properties depend on halo concentration, ICL formation efficiency, and the progenitor mass spectrum. Upcoming wide--field photometric and spectroscopic surveys (e.g. LSST, WEAVE, 4MOST) will provide crucial tests by mapping structure, metallicity, and kinematics in large galaxy samples.",

Accepted for publication in PASA Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Radio galaxy remnants are a rare subset of the radio-loud active galactic nuclei (RLAGN) population, representing the quiescent phase in the RLAGN lifecycle. Despite their observed scarcity, they offer valuable insights into the AGN duty cycle and feedback processes. Due to the mega-year timescales over which the RLAGN lifecycle takes place, it is impossible to observe the active to remnant transition in real-time. Numerical simulations offer a solution to follow the long-term evolution of RLAGN plasma. In this work, we present the largest suite (to date) of three-dimensional, hydrodynamic simulations studying the dynamic evolution of the active-to-remnant transition and explore the mechanisms driving cocoon evolution, comparing the results to the expectations of analytic modelling. Our results show key differences between active and remnant sources in both cluster environments and in lower-density group environments. We find that sources in low-density environments can remain overpressured well into the remnant phase. This significantly increases the time for the remnant lobe to transition to a buoyant regime. We compare our results with analytic expectations, showing that the long-term evolution of radio remnants can be well captured for remnants whose expansion is largely pressure-driven if the transition to a coasting phase is assumed to be gradual. We find that remnants of low-powered progenitors can continue to be momentum-driven for about 10 Myr after the jets switch-off. Finally, we consider how the properties of the progenitor influence the mixing of the remnant lobe and confirm the expectation that the remnants of high-powered sources have long-lasting shocks that can continue to heat the surrounding medium.",

Using the high-resolution, high-sensitivity 1.3 mm data from the QUARKS survey, we identify 125 Hot Molecular Fragments (HMFs), which represent the substructures of HMCs at higher resolution. From line integrated intensity maps of CH3CN(12--11) and H30\\alpha, we resolve the spatial distribution of HMFs and UC HII regions. By combining with observations of CO outflows and 1.3 mm continuum, we classify HMFs into four types: HMFs associated with jet-like outflow, with wide-angle outflow, with non-detectable outflow, and shell-like HMFs near UC HII regions. This diversity possibly indicates that the hot core could be polymorphic and long-standing phenomenon in the evolution of massive protostars. The separation between HMFs and H30\\alpha/H40\\alpha emission suggests that sequential high-mass star formation within young protoclusters is not likely related to feedback mechanisms.",

To address the limitations of manual classification in large-scale spectroscopic surveys - where the number of quasar spectra is growing exponentially - we propose BALNet, a deep learning approach consisting of a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) networks to automatically detect BAL troughs in quasar spectra. BALNet enables both the identification of BAL quasars and the measurement of their BAL troughs. We construct a simulated dataset for training and testing by combining non-BAL quasar spectra and BAL troughs, both derived from SDSS DR16 observations. Experimental results in the testing set show that: (1) BAL trough detection achieves 83.0% completeness, 90.7% purity, and an F1-score of 86.7%; (2) BAL quasar classification achieves 90.8% completeness and 94.4% purity; (3) the predicted BAL velocities agree closely with simulated ground truth labels, confirming BALNet's robustness and accuracy. When applied to the SDSS DR16 data within the redshift range 1.5<z<5.7, at least one BAL trough is detected in 20.4% of spectra. Notably, more than a quarter of these are newly identified sources with significant absorption, 8.8% correspond to redshifted systems, and some narrow/weak absorption features were missed. BALNet greatly improves the efficiency of large-scale BAL trough detection and enables more effective scientific analysis of quasar spectra.",

We therefore investigate a more efficient, machine learning (ML)-based method to classify $\\mbox{H}$ $\\mbox{I}$ 21-cm absorption lines. Using a sample of 118 known $\\mbox{H}$ $\\mbox{I}$ 21-cm absorption lines from the literature, we train six ML models (Gaussian naive Bayes, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, SVM and XGBoost) on the spectral parameters obtained by fitting the Busy function to the absorption spectra. We found that a random forest model trained on these spectral parameters gives the most reliable classification results, with an accuracy of 89%, a $F_1$-score of 0.9 and an AUC score of 0.94. We note that the linewidth parameter $w_{20}$ is the most significant spectral parameter that regulates the classification performance of this model. Retraining this random forest model only with this linewidth and the integrated optical depth parameters yields an accuracy of 88%, a $F_1$-score of 0.88 and an AUC score of 0.91. We have applied this retrained random forest model to predict the type of 30 new $\\mbox{H}$ $\\mbox{I}$ 21-cm absorption lines detected in recent blind surveys, viz.

      "abstract": "Neutral Atomic Hydrogen in a Star-forming Galaxy 7 Billion Years Ago Graham Lawrie, Roger Deane, Tariq Blecher, Danail Obreschkow, Ian Heywood, Shilpa Ranchod Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) constitutes a key phase of the cosmic baryon cycle, bridging the ionised circumgalactic medium and the star-forming molecular gas. Yet, nearly 75 years after its discovery, direct views of HI through its 21cm emission line remain largely confined to the nearby Universe. Indirect measurements and statistical analyses indicate little evolution in the comoving HI density over the past 10 billion years, in stark contrast to the order-of-magnitude decline in the cosmic star-formation rate density over the same epoch. Resolving this tension requires direct HI measurements in individual, representative galaxies at earlier times. Here we report a detection of HI 21cm emission from the Dragon Arc, a gravitationally lensed main-sequence star-forming galaxy at $z=0.725$, observed 6.6 billion years in the past with the MeerKAT radio telescope. The inferred intrinsic HI mass, $M_{\\rm HI}=10^{9.66^{+0.16}_{-0.19}}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$, and velocity width of $205^{+66}_{-48}\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$ are consistent with expectations from scaling relations for local star-forming galaxies. The resulting HI depletion time of $1.2^{+1.0}_{-0.6}\\,\\mathrm{Gyr}$ is significantly shorter than the $\\sim5-10$ Gyr, measured locally for comparable galaxies. This indicates that the galaxy must rapidly replenish its atomic gas reservoir to remain on the star-forming main sequence. This detection demonstrates that strong gravitational lensing, combined with modern cm-wave facilities, can now reveal the HI reservoirs of typical galaxies well beyond the local Universe, opening a new path toward statistical samples that will directly trace the evolution of the cosmic atomic gas supply.",

We present a systematic search for satellites around the isolated dwarf galaxy DDO 161 ($M_\\star \\approx 10^{8.4}\\, M_\\odot$) at a distance of 6 Mpc. We identify eight satellite candidates within the projected virial radius and confirm four satellites through surface brightness fluctuation distance measurements from deep Magellan imaging data. With four confirmed satellites above $M_{\\star}^{\\rm sat} > 10^{5.4}\\, M_\\odot$, DDO 161 is the most satellite-rich dwarf galaxy known to date. We compare this system with predictions from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, combined with currently established galaxy-halo connection models calibrated on Milky Way satellites, and find that DDO 161 has a satellite abundance far exceeding all current expectations. The rich satellite system of DDO 161 offers new insight into how low-mass galaxies occupy dark matter halos in low-density environments and may provide new constraints on the nature of dark matter.",

Viti, F. Walter, P. P. van der Werf, C. Yang Submitted to A&A. First version 14th August 2025; revised 4th November 2025 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Characterising the relationship between dense gas and star formation is critical for understanding the assembly of galaxies throughout cosmic history. However, due to the faintness of standard dense-gas tracers - HCN, HCO+, and HNC - dense gas in high-redshift galaxies remains largely unexplored. We present ALMA and NOEMA observations targeting HCN/HCO+/HNC (3-2) and (4-3) emission lines in eleven (mostly) gravitationally lensed dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at redshift z = 1.6--3.2. We detect at least one line in 10 out of 11 galaxies. Altogether, we detect 34 dense-gas transitions, more than quadrupling the number of extant high-redshift detections. Additionally, in two targets, we detect lower-abundance CO isotopologues 13^CO and C^18O, as well as CN emission. We derive excitation coefficients for HCN, HCO+ and HNC in DSFGs, finding them to be systematically higher than those in nearby luminous infrared galaxies. Assuming a canonical dense-mass conversion factor (alpha_HCN = 10), we find that DSFGs have shorter dense- gas depletion times (median 23 Myr) than nearby galaxies (~60 Myr), with a star-forming efficiency per free-fall time of 1-2%, a factor of a few higher than in local galaxies. We find a wide range of dense-gas fractions, with HCN/CO ratios ranging between 0.01 and 0.15. Finally, we put the first constraints on the redshift evolution of the cosmic dense-gas density, which increases by a factor of 7+/-4 between z = 0 and z = 2.5, consistent with the evolution of the cosmic molecular-gas density.",

Zou Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present luminosity functions (LFs) in the g, r, z, and W_1 bands from the DESI Year 3 Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS), spanning redshifts 0.002<z<0.6. We detail our methodology, including updated k-corrections, evolutionary corrections, and completeness weights. New polynomial k-correction fits based on BGS Y1 supersede those from GAMA DR4. Our LFs reach very faint magnitudes, down to M - 5 log h ~ -10 in r. Independent North and South estimates agree well near the LF knee, with very small statistical errors. These errors reveal that simple analytic forms poorly fit the LFs: the bright end deviates from an exponential, and the faint end shows complex, non-power-law behaviour. We detect an upturn at M - 5 log h > -15, stronger in red galaxies. Below -13, local overdensities and fragmentation of large galaxies amplify this upturn. A systematic offset between North and South appears at the brightest magnitudes, driven by red galaxies. Blue LFs match well across regions, suggesting the discrepancy arises from red galaxy profiles blending into noise in shallower North photometry. This remains inconclusive, so the bright-end offset is treated as a systematic uncertainty. We also present LFs using model Petrosian magnitudes, which are less sensitive to this issue. Splitting by redshift reveals small but significant residuals, indicating our global evolution model, while accurate near the LF knee, misses more complex trends. Using Loveday (2011) redshift limits, we find excellent agreement with GAMA, but with smaller errors. Our methods and results provide a foundation for studying LF dependence on environment, such as local density and cosmic web classification, offering strong constraints on galaxy formation models.",

Lombardi Jr., Elena González Prieto, Fulya Kıroğlu, Frederic A. Rasio Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Nuclear star clusters represent some of the most extreme collisional environments in the Universe. A typical nuclear star cluster harbors a supermassive black hole at its center, which accelerates stars to high speeds ($\\gtrsim 100$-$1000$ km/s) in a region where millions of other stars reside. Direct collisions occur frequently in such high-density environments, where they can shape the stellar populations and drive the evolution of the cluster. We present a suite of a couple hundred high-resolution smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of collisions between $1$ M$_\\odot$ stars, at impact speeds representative of galactic nuclei. We use our SPH dataset to develop physically-motivated fitting formulae for predicting collision outcomes. While collision-driven mass loss has been examined in detail in the literature, we present a new framework for understanding the effects of \"hit-and-run\" collisions on a star's trajectory. We demonstrate that the change in stellar velocity follows the tidal-dissipation limit for grazing encounters, while the deflection angle is well-approximated by point-particle dynamics for periapses $\\gtrsim0.3$ times the stellar radii. We use our SPH dataset to test two machine learning (ML) algorithms, k-Nearest Neighbors and neural networks, for predicting collision outcomes and properties. We find that the neural network out-performs k-Nearest Neighbors and delivers results on par with and in some cases exceeding the accuracy of our fitting formulae. We conclude that both fitting formulae and ML have merits for modeling collisions in dense stellar environments, however ML may prove more effective as the parameter space of initial conditions expands.",

Observed SEDs are compared with theoretical models to characterize the central stars and their circumstellar dust envelopes and to estimate distances. For the LMC, a set of best-fitting CAGB models is derived by fitting observed SEDs with radiative transfer models, utilizing the galaxy's well-established distance. For Galactic CAGB stars, where Gaia DR3 parallaxes are uncertain, we estimate distances by fitting observed SEDs with the CAGB models validated against LMC stars, and for Mira variables, from the period-magnitude relation calibrated with LMC Miras. A comparison of these approaches demonstrates that SED-based distances are both reliable and practical for a large sample of Galactic CAGB stars. We find that CAGB stars in both galaxies show broadly similar infrared properties, although the LMC sample lacks stars with extremely thick dust envelopes.",

Among particle-based methods like Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), the One-Fluid model has proven to be highly effective for simulating gas-dust mixtures. This study presents the implementation of the One-Fluid model in OpenGadget3, introducing improvements to the original formulation. These enhancements include time-dependent artificial viscosity and conductivity, as well as a novel treatment of dust diffusion using a pressure-like term. The improved model is tested using a suite of dust dynamics benchmark problems: DUSTYBOX, DUSTYWAVE, and DUSTYSHOCK, with the latter extended to multidimensional scenarios, as well as a dusty Sedov-Taylor blast wave. Additional tests include simulations of Cold Keplerian Disks, dusty protoplanetary disks, and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities to evaluate the model's robustness in more complex flows. The implementation successfully passes all standard benchmark tests. It demonstrates stability and accuracy in both simple and complex simulations. The new diffusion term improves the handling of flows with large dust-to-gas ratios and low drag coefficients, although limitations of the One-Fluid model in these regimes remain. The enhanced One-Fluid model is a reliable and robust tool for simulating dust dynamics in OpenGadget3. While it retains some limitations inherent to the original formulation, the introduced improvements expand its applicability and address some challenges in gas-dust dynamics.",

Two competing theories for its origin have emerged, positing the gas to be primordial or secondary. Primordial gas survives from the belt's parent protoplanetary disk and is therefore H$_2$-rich. Secondary gas is outgassed \\textit{in-situ} by exocomets and is relatively H$_2$-poor. Discriminating between these scenarios has not been possible for belts hosting unexpectedly large quantities of CO. We aim to break this gas origin dichotomy \\textit{via} direct measurement of H$_2$ column densities in two edge-on CO-rich exocometary belts around $\\sim$15 Myr-old A-type stars, constraining the $\\frac{\\text{CO}}{\\text{H}_2}$ ratio and CO gas lifetimes. Observing edge-on belts enables rovibrational absorption spectroscopy against the stellar background. We present near-IR CRIRES+ spectra of HD 110058 and HD 131488 which provide the first direct probe of H$_2$ gas in CO-rich exocometary belts. We target the H$_2$ (v=1-0 S(0)) line at 2223.3 nm and and the $^{12}$CO $v=2\\rightarrow0$ rovibrational lines in the range 2333.8-2335.5 nm and derive constraints on column densities along the line-of-sight to the stars. We strongly detect $^{12}$CO but not H$_2$ in the CRIRES+ spectra. This allows us to place $3\\sigma$ lower limits on the $\\frac{\\text{CO}}{\\text{H}_2}$ ratios of $> 1.35 \\times 10^{-3}$ and $> 3.09 \\times 10^{-5}$ for HD 110058 and HD 131488 respectively. These constraints demonstrate that at least for HD 110058, the exocometary gas is compositionally distinct and significantly H$_2$-poor, compared to the $<10^{-4}$ $\\frac{\\text{CO}}{\\text{H}_2}$ ratios typical of protoplanetary disks. We also find H$_2$ alone is unlikely to shield CO over the lifetime of the systems. Overall this suggests that the gas in CO-rich belts is most likely not primordial in origin, supporting the presence of exocometary gas.",

The far-side of the Moon, either in lunar-orbit or on lunar-surface, is the ideal site for observations in this band, and the upcoming Moon-based interferometers will obtain multi-frequency high-resolution sky maps. Making use of the lunar occultation of the sky and the anisotropy of antenna primary beam response, we propose a novel method to reconstruct the ultra-long wavelength spectral shape in multiple directions in the sky using only one antenna on lunar orbit. We apply the method to one antenna on one of the nine daughter satellites of the proposed Discovering the Sky at Longest wavelength (DSL) project. Using simulated observation data between 1 - 30 MHz from one dipole antenna, we find that the spectra for different regions on the sky can be reconstructed very well and the free-free absorption feature in each region can be derived from the reconstructed spectra. This work demonstrates the feasibility to reconstruct the anisotropic ultra-long wavelength spectra with very limited instrumentation on a lunar-orbit, with mature technologies already in place. It extends the application of such kind of satellite in revealing the distribution of free electrons in the Galactic interstellar medium from the distribution of absorption features in the ultra-long wavelength sky.",

Wang Accepted by Astronomy & Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Compact symmetric objects (CSOs) trace the earliest phases of radio-galaxy growth; however, robust classification is difficult when radio cores are weak or invisible. We aim to develop and test a Gaia+VLBI approach that utilizes the high-precision optical astrometry of Gaia together with the high-resolution imaging of VLBI to reliably locate the central engine and classify CSOs. We analysed 40 literature CSO candidates by overlaying Gaia DR3 positions on VLBI maps and by examining spectral index distributions, whole-source variability, and hotspot kinematics over up to 25 years. A source is classified as a CSO when the Gaia centroid lies between two steep-spectrum lobes. Our method yields 20 confirmed CSOs. The confirmed CSOs show low integrated variability, slow hotspot advance speeds, and kinematic ages of 20-2000 yr. High-power CSOs tend to be larger and host faster hotspots, while many low-power systems remain sub-kiloparsec and environmentally confined. Gaia+VLBI registration is a powerful method for CSO classification, especially where radio cores are faint. The observed power-size-velocity-age relations support distinct multiple evolutionary tracks, with high-power CSOs plausibly growing into large radio galaxies, while low-power CSOs appear confined by their host galaxy environments. Taken together, our results indicate that CSO evolution is shaped not only by intrinsic jet power, but also by host-galaxy environment and the duty cycle of the central engine. High-sensitivity observations of low-power CSOs will be crucial to map the full diversity of formation channels and evolutionary pathways of radio galaxies.",

      "abstract": "Testing compact massive black hole binary candidates through multi-epoch spectroscopy Lorenzo Bertassi, Erika Sottocorno, Fabio Rigamonti, Daniel J. D'Orazio, Michael Eracleous, Zoltán Haiman, Massimo Dotti Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Emission from two massive black holes (MBHs) bound in a close binary is expected to be modulated by different processes, such as the Doppler boost due to the orbital motion, accretion rate variability generated by the interaction with a circumbinary disc, and binary gravitational self-lensing. When the binary is compact enough, the two black holes are thought to be surrounded by a common broad-line region that reprocesses the impinging periodically varying ionising flux, creating broad emission lines with variable line shapes. Therefore, the study of broad emission line variability through multi-epoch spectroscopic campaigns is of paramount importance for the unambiguous identification of a binary. In this work, we study the response of a disc-like broad-line region to the Doppler-boosted ionising flux emitted by sub-milliparsec MBH binaries on a circular orbit and compare it with the response of a broad-line region illuminated by a single MBH with a periodically but isotropically varying intrinsic luminosity. We show that in the binary case, the time lags of the blue and red wings of the broad emission lines, arising from diametrically opposite sides of the circumbinary disc, are out of phase by half of the binary's orbital period, as they each respond to the periodic \"lighthouse\" modulation from the binary's continuum emission. This asymmetric time lag represents a new binary signature that cannot be mimicked by a single MBH.",

Using Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam narrow-band imaging and spectroscopic follow-up, we serendipitously discover \"Oxyster\" - a large ionized nebula next to an interacting starburst galaxy at $z=0.924$. The nebula is traced by extended [OII]3726,3729 ($\\sim 30$ kpc) and [OIII]5007 ($\\sim 20$ kpc) emission lines. On the nebula luminosity-size plane, Oxyster surpasses the extended narrow-line regions around low-$z$ AGNs, resembling a higher-$z$ analog of \"Hanny's Voorwerp\". However, its uniformly low [OIII]/[OII] ratio (O32) sets it apart from typical AGN light echoes. For the host galaxy, HST and JWST images reveal a disturbed red disk galaxy with a single blue spiral \"arm\". Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting suggests the $2-6\\times 10^{10} ~\\rm M_{\\odot}$ host galaxy sits above the star-forming main sequence with an ongoing starburst, especially in the \"arm\", and have $<5\\%$ luminosity contribution from AGN, consistent with X-ray non-detection and radio continuum. Standard photoionization and shock models struggle to explain simultaneously Oxyster's emission line luminosities, low O32 ratio, and the non-detection of H$\\beta$ line. A plausible explanation could involve the combination of a recent ($<10^8$ yrs) starburst and a low-luminosity AGN ($L_{\\rm{bol}} \\sim 1\\times10^{42}$ erg/s). While Oxyster's nature awaits future investigation, its discovery highlights the potential of ground-based narrow-band imaging to uncover extended emission line nebulae around non-AGN systems, opening new avenues for studying the CGM of normal galaxies in the early Universe.",

Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics (A&A) after minor revisions and an extended discussion. Software available at this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present an efficient Bayesian SED-fitting framework tailored to multiwavelength pixel photometry from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). Our method employs simulation-based inference to enable rapid posterior sampling across galaxy pixels, leveraging the unprecedented spatial resolution, wavelength coverage, and depth provided by the survey. It is trained on synthetic photometry generated from MILES stellar population models, incorporating both parametric and non-parametric SFHs, realistic noise, and JADES-like filter sensitivity thresholds. We validate this amortised inference approach on mock datasets, achieving robust and well-calibrated posterior distributions, with an $R^2$ score of 0.99 for stellar mass. Applying our pipeline to real observations, we derive spatially resolved maps of stellar population properties down to $\\mathrm{S/N}_{\\rm{pixel}}=5$ (averaged over F277W, F356W, F444W) for 1083 JADES galaxies and ~2 million pixels with spectroscopic redshifts. These maps enable the identification of dusty or starburst regions and offer insights into mass growth and the structural assembly. We assess the outshining phenomenon by comparing pixel-based and integrated stellar mass estimates, finding limited impact only in low-mass galaxies ($<10^8M_{\\odot}$) but systematic differences of ~0.20 dex linked to SFH priors. With an average posterior sampling speed of $10^{-4}$ seconds per pixel and a total inference time of ~1 CPU-day for the full dataset, our model offers a scalable solution for extracting high-fidelity stellar population properties from HST+JWST datasets, opening the way for statistical studies at sub-galactic scales.",

Mondal Accepted for publication in Astrophysical Journal (ApJ) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Hybrid morphology radio sources (HyMoRSs) are a rare subclass of radio galaxies that display a Fanaroff-Riley type I (FR I) morphology on one side of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) and a type II (FR II) morphology on the other. In this study, we report the discovery of thirty-six new HyMoRSs, marking the largest collection of such sources in the southern sky to date, using data obtained from the MeerKAT absorption line survey (MALS). The identified HyMoRSs exhibit moderate radio luminosities in the range $9.9 \\times 10^{23}$ to $5.7 \\times 10^{25}$ W $Hz^{-1}$, with a median value of $4.4 \\times 10^{24}$ W $Hz^{-1}$ at 1.4 GHz, and are located within the redshift range $0.04<z<1.34$. In this work, we show for the first time that the two lobes of HyMoRSs exhibit no statistically significant difference in their spectral indices. We also investigate the mid-infrared properties and environments of their host galaxies. Notably, nine out of the thirty-six sources are situated near the centers of galaxy clusters, including one with giant radio jets that extend over 811 kpc. Our analysis reveals that the majority of HyMoRSs are hosted by actively star-forming galaxies that exhibit elevated star formation rates. Furthermore, our findings suggest that HyMoRSs may arise from FR II jets being deflected by a dense, cluster-like environment, along with orientation effects that make one jet appear FR I-like. As our candidates are selected through visual inspection of MALS radio maps, higher-resolution follow-up observations are still necessary to confirm the nature of their morphologies.",

Minor corrections to match the published version in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We measure and compare the size of the dusty torus with active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity and the size of the broad-line region (BLR), using a sample of 182 AGNs with the best H$\\beta$ lag measurements. After correcting for accretion-disk contamination, torus sizes are determined from the time lags of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer W1 and W2 band light curves relative to the optical band variability based on the interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF) analysis and the Multiple and Inhomogeneous Component Analysis. We find that the torus size from the W1-band (W2-band) tightly correlates with the 5100~Å continuum luminosity with an intrinsic scatter of 0.15-0.16 dex and the best-fit slope of $0.35 \\pm 0.03$ ($0.33 \\pm 0.03$), which is clearly shallower than the expected 0.5 slope from the sublimation radius-luminosity relation. We find a moderate negative trend that higher Eddington AGNs tend to have smaller torus sizes than expected from the best-fit, suggesting the Eddington ratio plays a role in flattening the torus size-luminosity relation. By comparing the torus size with the H$\\beta$ reverberation time lag for a subsample of 67 AGNs, we find that the torus size is a factor of $\\sim 10$ and $\\sim 14$ larger than the BLR size, respectively for W1 and W2 bands. The torus size based on the W1 (W2) band correlates with the BLR size with the best-fit slope of $1.28 \\pm 0.16$ ($1.10 \\pm 0.15$), which is comparable but slightly steeper than a linear correlation.",

Viti 14 pages, 18 figures, re-submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics, after referee's comments Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Recent high resolution mapping of the circum-nuclear regions of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) has revealed the existence of geometrically thin nuclear disks, in general randomly oriented with respect to their galaxy hosts. These molecular tori have typical radii of 10~pc, and contain a few 10$^7$ M$_\\odot$ of H$_2$, with H$_2$ column densities between 10$^{23}$ and 10$^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$. We mapped two of the most massive of these molecular tori with higher resolution, in order to unveil their morphology and kinematics, their possible warp and clumpiness, and derive their stability and life-time. We used the highest resolution possible with ALMA (16~km baseline) in Band 7, taking into account for mapping CO(3-2) and HCO$^+$(4-3) the compromise between sensitivity and resolution. New features are discovered at the high resolution, obtained with a beam of 0.015\\arcsec, equivalent to $\\sim$ 1~pc scale, at their $\\sim$ 15~Mpc distance. The molecular torus in NGC~613 appears like a ring, depleted in molecular gas near the center. The depletion region is displaced by 3~pc toward the NW from the AGN position, meaning some $m=1$ asymmetry in the torus. The molecular torus in NGC~1672 has a different position angle from previous lower-resolution observations, and is edge-on, revealing a geometrically very thin torus (axis ratio 6.5 to 10), with a clear warp. This confirms that the classical model of a simple geometrically thick dusty torus is challenged by high resolution observations. The nuclear disks appear clumpy, and slightly lopsided. The molecular outflow in NGC~613 is now resolved out. Well inside the sphere of influence of the black holes (BH), we are now able to determine more accurately their mass, for those Seyfert spiral galaxies, in a region of the M-sigma relation where the scatter is maximum.",

Accepted for publication in MNRAS (30 October 2025) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a structural analysis of bulges in dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies. Dual AGN arise in galaxy mergers where both supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are actively accreting. The AGN are typically embedded in compact bulges, which appear as luminous nuclei in optical images. Galaxy mergers can result in bulge growth, often via star formation. The bulges can be disky (pseudobulges), classical bulges, or belong to elliptical galaxies. Using SDSS DR18 gri images and GALFIT modelling, we performed 2D decomposition for 131 dual AGN bulges (comprising 61 galaxy pairs and 3 galaxy triplets) identified in the GOTHIC survey. We derived sérsic indices, luminosities, masses, and scalelengths of the bulges. Most bulges (105/131) are classical, with sérsic indices lying between $n=2$ and $n=8$. Among these, 64% are elliptical galaxies, while the remainder are classical bulges in disc galaxies. Only $\\sim$20% of the sample exhibit pseudobulges. Bulge masses span $1.5\\times10^9$ to $1.4\\times10^{12}\\,M_\\odot$, with the most massive systems being ellipticals. Galaxy type matching shows that elliptical--elliptical (E--E) and elliptical--disc (E--D) mergers dominate over disc--disc (D--D) mergers. At least one galaxy in two-thirds of the dual AGN systems is elliptical and only $\\sim$30% involve two disc galaxies. Although our sample is limited, our results suggest that dual AGN preferentially occur in evolved, red, quenched systems, that typically form via major mergers. They are predominantly hosted in classical bulges or elliptical galaxies rather than star-forming disc galaxies.",

The standard theory of stellar evolution is significantly challenged by this event. We investigate the formation of candidate progenitors of GW231123 in Population III (Pop III) star clusters. We find that they could form through stellar mergers, binary black hole mergers, and mixed mergers. The mass distribution of these candidate progenitors covers the component masses of GW231123. Under our model assumptions, their predicted merger rate density spans the range of $0.001-0.26{\\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$, encompassing that of GW231123. These findings suggest that GW231123 may originate from Pop III star clusters. Furthermore, such candidate progenitors are expected to be detectable by future gravitational wave detectors LISA/Taiji/TianQin/DECIGO/Cosmic Explorer/Einstein Telescope, which would provide valuable insights into the formation scenarios of events like GW231123.",

O'Brien, Simon Blouin, Boris T. Gänsicke, Vince Fairchild Accepted for publication in MNRAS Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Gaia observations have reignited interest in the optical and ultraviolet (UV) opacity problems of cool white dwarfs ($T_{\\rm eff} \\leq 6000$ K), which were thought to be resolved nearly two decades ago through the inclusion of Lyman $\\alpha$ red wing opacity arising from H-H$_2$ collisions in atmospheric models. Recent studies have revealed that their masses derived from Gaia optical photometry are 0.1$-$0.2 M$_{\\odot}$ lower than expected from single-star evolution. Since the Ly $\\alpha$ H-H$_2$ wing opacity significantly affects the blue end of their optical spectra, it may contribute to the mass discrepancy. To investigate this hypothesis, we revisited the Ly $\\alpha$ opacity calculations in the quasi-static single and multi-perturber approximations by explicitly using the ab initio potential energy data of H$_3$ while fully accounting for the H-H$_2$ collision angle. We find that the opacity is slightly smaller than the standard models at the shortest wavelengths ($\\leq5000$ angstrom), but larger at longer wavelengths. Comparing synthetic magnitudes (GALEX, Gaia, WISE) to the observations of the 40 pc white dwarf sample, we note that the revised models tentatively reproduce the observed $NUV-G$ colours for stars cooler than 6000 K, but still fail to match $G_{\\rm BP} - G_{\\rm RP}$ colours, resulting in similarly low inferred masses ($\\leq 0.5$ M$_{\\odot}$) as obtained with the standard Ly $\\alpha$ opacity. Exploring other dominant opacity sources, we discover that decreasing the strength of the bound-free H$^-$ opacity in existing models better reproduces the optical and infrared colours, while collision-induced absorption (CIA) opacity is ineffective in resolving the low-mass problem. We highlight the need for improved opacities and multi-wavelength observations in future studies.",

Singapore: Springer Nature Singapore Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) This study utilizes \"Al-Wardat's method for analysing binary and multiple stellar systems\" to estimate a set of parameters for the triple system Hip70868. The method compares the system's observational magnitudes, color indices, and spectral energy distribution (SED) and synthetic SEDs generated through atmospheric modeling of each component. Feedback-adjusted parameters and an iterative approach were employed to achieve the best fit between observational (including the latest measurements of Gaia, release DR3) and synthetic spectral energy distributions. The findings were completed using the distance of 71.89 pc given by Hipparcos 2007's new reduction. The individual components' parameters for the system were derived afterward. The parameters obtained for the individual components are as follows: Component A has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000 +- 50 K, a surface gravity (log ga) of 4.50 +- 0.05, and a radius (Ra) of 1.43 +- 0.07 R_sun. Component B has a (Teff) of 5910 +- 50 K, a (log gb) of 4.40 +- 0.05, and a radius (Rb) of 1.35 +- 0.07 R_sun. The spectral types of the components were found to be F9 IV and G1 IV, respectively. The findings from this analysis were utilized to accurately position the two system components on the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram and the evolutionary tracks. The analysis shows that the components have transitioned from the main sequence to the sub-giant stage of their evolution.",

In this paper, we report the occurrence of an M-shaped CME event associated with a blowout jet and an EUV wave using high-resolution, multi-angle and multi-wavelength observations taken from Solar Dynamics Observatory, and Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory. Interestingly, and for the first time, it is found that two bubble-like CMEs and a jet-like CME were simultaneously triggered by the same eruptive event. Our observational analyses and findings indicate the following: (1) the eruption of a blowout jet led to a large-scale EUV wave; (2) the eruption of the EUV wave swept a small filament (prominence) and a long filament; (3) eventually the EUV wave split-up into two parts, leading to the two bubble-like CMEs, while the blowout jet induced a jet-like CME. The combined events appear to form an M-shape like structure CME, that we sketch throughout a proposed cartoon tentatively explaining the observed complex configuration. Based on observational diagnosis, we argue that the jet, the EUV wave and the multi-CME are highly interlinked. A suggested eruption-model, from the solar atmosphere to the space, is outlined and discussed, providing a possibly new way to probe the relationship between the solar eruptions and the surrounding space. The investigation of such rare phenomenon can be a key point for better understanding of the physical associated triggering mechanisms and energy transport in the solar atmosphere, crucial for MHD simulations and modeling.",

Beers, Shuai Xu Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The China Space Station Telescope (CSST) will conduct a deep and wide imaging survey in the NUV-, u-, g-, r-, i-, z-, and y-bands. In this work, using theoretical data synthesized from the BOSZ spectra of Bohlin et al. (2017), along with observational data constructed from different sources, we present two methods for estimating stellar parameters from CSST-like photometry. One approach is to estimate metallicity [M/H] and surface gravity log g simultaneously by using the metallicity- and log g-dependent stellar loci. Tests with theoretical data (without photometric errors) result in precisions of 0.088 dex and 0.083 dex for [M/H] and log g, respectively. With 0.01 mag photometric errors, precision is degraded by about a factor of two, due to degeneracy in [M/H] and log g. Tests with observational data, although with larger photometric errors, result in precisions of 0.10 dex and 0.39 dex for [Fe/H] and log g, respectively, thanks to the strong correlation between stellar colors and log g in real data. The other approach is the giant-dwarf loci method to obtain classifications and metallicity estimates. With the same observational data, it achieves a better [Fe/H] precision of 0.084 dex, due to the stronger constraints imposed on log g. The method also performs well in distinguishing giants from dwarfs, particularly for red or metal-poor giants. This work demonstrates the clear potential of the CSST data, paving the way for stellar-parameter estimates for many billions of stars.",

      "abstract": "Observational signatures of outside-in accretion bursts in embedded protostars August T. Masley, Lee Hartmann Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Optical and infrared surveys have detected increasing numbers of disc accretion outbursts in young stars. Some models of these FU Ori-type events predict that the outburst should start at near- to mid-infrared wavelengths before an optical rise is detected, and this lag between infrared and optical bursts has been observed in at least two systems. Detecting and characterizing infrared precursors can constrain the outburst trigger region, and thus help identify the mechanism producing the outburst. However, because FU Ori objects are generally young and usually embedded in dusty protostellar envelopes, it is not clear whether or how well such infrared precursors can be detected in the presence of strong envelope extinction. To explore this question, we combine time-dependent outburst models of the inner disc with an outer dusty disc and protostellar envelope, and calculate the resulting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using the radiative transfer code RADMC3D. We find that, for envelope mass infall rates about 10^{-5} Msun/yr (rc/30 au)^{-1/2}, where rc is a characteristic inner radius for the infalling envelope, the infrared precursor is only apparent in the SED when viewed along the outflow cavity. At other inclinations, the precursor is most easily distinguished at infall rates of 10^{-6} Msun/yr (rc/30 au)^{-1/2}. We also show that far-IR and submm/mm monitoring can enable the indirect detection of precursor evolution long before the optical outburst, emphasizing the potential of long-wavelength monitoring for studying the earliest stages of protostar formation.",

Interestingly, this same observable that establishes the position of transient blob-like structures becomes a local measure of the slope of the global falloff of density in the background solar wind. It is thus important to characterize the extent along the line of sight of structures being studied, in order to determine whether they are sufficiently compact for 3D positioning. In this paper, we build from analyses of individual lines of sight to three-dimensional models of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), allowing us to consider how accurately polarization properties of the transient and quiescent solar wind are diagnosed. In this way, we demonstrate the challenges and opportunities presented by PUNCH polarization data for various quantitative diagnostics.",

The model represents each grid node as a flux tube, as in the classic model, but with connections evolving to capture the complex effects of magnetic reconnection. Through this framework, we analyze how the dissipated energy distribution changes, particularly focusing on the power-law exponent $\\alpha_E$, which decreases with respect to the original model due to rewiring effects. When the system is dominated by rewiring, it presents an exponential distribution exponent $\\beta_E$, showing a faster decay of dissipated energy than in the original model. This leads to microflare-dominated dynamics at short timescales, causing the system to lose the scale-free behavior observed in both the original model (Lu \\& Hamilton 1991) and in configurations where energy release is primarily driven by forcing rather than rewiring. Our results reveal a clear transition from power-law to exponential regimes as the rewiring probability increases, fundamentally altering the energy distribution characteristics of the system. In contrast, when considering topological neighbors instead of local ones, the model's dynamics become intrinsically nonlocal. This leads to scaling exponents comparable to those reported in other nonlocal dynamical systems.",

Comparison of 0.9-2.5 $\\mu$m near-infrared spectra of these sources to spectral standards indicates spectral types spanning L1 to T8, and spectrophotometric distances spanning 800-3,000 pc. Fits to three grids of spectral models yield atmosphere parameters and spectrophotometric distances largely consistent with our classifications, although fits to L dwarf spectra indicate missing components to the models. Three of our sources have vertical displacements from the Galactic plane exceeding 1 kpc, and have high probabilities of membership in the Galactic thick disk population. Of these, the L dwarf RUBIES-BD-3 (RUBIES-EGS-3081) is well-matched to subdwarf standards, while the early T dwarf RUBIES-BD-5 (RUBIES-UDS-170428) is best fit by metal-poor atmosphere models; both many be a thick disk or halo brown dwarfs. We critically examine the 1-5 $\\mu$m spectra of the current sample of 1-2 kpc mid- and late-T dwarfs, finding that temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and vertical mixing efficiency can all contribute to observed variations in near-infrared spectral structure and the strength of the 4.2 $\\mu$m CO band.

Guglielmino 16 pages, 12 figures, Accepted in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Plasma flow measurements in solar active region filaments are rare, particularly in the infrared and ultraviolet ranges that probe the chromosphere and transition region. In addition, previous studies generally focused on prominences and filaments near the solar limb. This study presents a multi-wavelength, multi-instrument analysis of an active region filament observed on the solar disk on November 9 and 10, 2020. Our goal is to characterize the plasma flows in the filament using spectroscopic measurements in both the infrared and ultraviolet spectral ranges. This is important for understanding the mechanisms for filament support, mass loading, and energy balance. Furthermore, this also offers observational benchmarks for filament modeling and simulations. Spectra from the IRIS satellite, including the Mg II k, C II and Si IV lines were analyzed alongside ground-based observations from the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph and High-resolution Fast Imager instruments whose observed spectral ranges include the chromospheric He I and H{\\alpha} lines. Persistent blueshifts were measured within the filament structure in both spectral ranges. These can be interpreted as upflow velocities ranging from 0.5 to 15 km s^-1, with the Si IV showing the highest values. Red shifted emission in the He I and Mg II k3 at the footpoints of a newly formed dark bundle suggest chromospheric downflows, likely due to spatial overlap between an arch filament system close to the filament footpoints. The weak redshifted signal in the Si IV emission may suggest confinement to lower atmospheric layers. The observed velocity patterns provide, for the first time, a comprehensive and coherent view of the plasma dynamics from the chromosphere to the transition region, illustrating that the filament emission is consistently blueshifted in all the spectral windows, and thus in different temperature regimes.",

Mombarg, Luc IJspeert, Mykyta Kilapets, Andrew Tkachenko, Conny Aerts Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) In this work, we seek to characterise a large sample of 14377 main sequence eclipsing binaries in terms of their stellar, asteroseismic, and orbital properties. We conduct manual vetting on a 4000-target subset of our full 14377-target sample to identify targets with pressure or gravity modes. We infer stellar properties including the mass, convective core mass, radius, and central H fraction for the primary using Gaia Data Release 3 effective temperature and luminosity estimates and a grid of asteroseismically calibrated stellar models. We use surface brightness ratio and radius ratio estimates from previous eclipse analysis to study the effect of binarity on our results. Our manual vetting identifies 751 candidate g-mode pulsators, 131 p-mode pulsators, and a further 48 hybrid pulsators. The inferred stellar properties of the hybrid and p-mode pulsators are highly correlated, while the orbital properties of the hybrid pulsators align best with the g-mode pulsators. The g-mode pulsators themselves show a distribution that peaks around the classical g dor instability region but extends continuously towards higher masses, with no detectable divide between the classical g dor and SPB instability regions. There is evidence at the population level for a heightened level of tidal efficiency in stars showing g-mode or hybrid variability. Correcting the primary mass inference for binarity based on eclipse measurements of the surface brightness and radius ratios results in a relatively small shift towards lower masses. This work provides a working initial characterisation of this sample from which more detailed analyses folding in asteroseismic information can be built. It also provides a foundational understanding of the limitations and capabilities of this kind of rapid, scalable analysis that will be highly relevant in planning the exploitation of future large-scale binary surveys.",

      "abstract": "Apsidal motion in massive binaries Sophie Rosu Proceedings of the conference Rodolfo Barbá, Madrid, Spain, 2024. To be published in CEAB Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) One of the most efficient and reliable observational technique allowing to probe the internal structure of a star is the determination of the apsidal motion in close eccentric binaries. This secular precession of the binary orbit's major axis depends on the tidal interactions occurring between the two stars. Its rate is directly related to the internal structure of the stars, in particular their inner density profile. Combining radial velocity and light curve data over a long timescale, the apsidal motion rate can be constrained, together with the fundamental parameters of the stars. Confrontation of observational parameters to stellar models then allows us to constrain the internal structure of stars. This powerful technique has been known for years but has been seldom applied to massive stars. I highlight its interest and reveal recent results concerning several massive binaries. While standard stellar models predict stars having a smaller internal stellar structure constant, that is to say, stars having a smaller density contrast, than expected from observations, I demonstrate that the addition of mixing inside the models helps to solve, at least partially, this discrepancy. Studies with the non-perturbative code MoBiDICT showed that the perturbative model assumption is not justified in highly distorted stars, in which cases the apsidal motion is underestimated, exacerbating even more the need for enhanced mixing inside the models. But what happens if the binary is a double-line spectroscopic but non-eclipsing binary? In that case, we indeed have no estimate of the masses and radii of the stars. Surprisingly, the apsidal motion equations combined with the binary' spectroscopic observations allow us to derive the masses of the stars, in a model-dependent way. Rodolfo Barbá contributed to the development of this original method that I bring out.",

Owens Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We investigate the evolution of interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) sheath regions at 1 AU across solar cycles 23, 24, and the rising phase of 25, focusing on their variability and turbulence in relation to upstream solar wind conditions and the global heliospheric state. Using a dataset of over 900 ICME sheath events, we apply statistical metrics such as the interquartile range (IQR) and the Turbulence Index (TI) to quantify variability and turbulence. The analysis compares full and rising phases of solar cycles and examines both local ICME parameters (e.g., sheath total pressure, non-radial flows) and global interplanetary indicators such as open solar flux (OSF). From SC23 to SC24, sheath total pressure and magnetic field strength decreased by over 40% and 25%, respectively, accompanied by reduced turbulence and variability. In contrast, the rising phase of SC25 shows increased magnetic complexity, particularly in non-radial field components, despite stable bulk parameters. Non-radial flow patterns also shift from tangentially dominated in SC23-SC24 to normal-dominated in SC25, suggesting changes in ICME orientation and sheath formation mechanisms. No significant correlation is found between OSF and sheath properties, indicating that local solar wind and ICME specific factors are the primary drivers of sheath evolution. The study reinforces the importance of upstream solar wind dynamics in relation to variations in plasma and magnetic field measured components of ICME sheaths. The derived trends in turbulence, magnetic orientation, and flow geometry suggest that sheath regions are sensitive indicators of solar cycle phase and should be considered as distinct, structured components in ICME modeling.",

ASPIICS (Association of Spacecraft for Polarimetric and Imaging Investigation of the Corona of the Sun) is a giant coronagraph consisting of the telescope mounted aboard one of the mission's spacecraft and the external occulter placed on the second spacecraft. The two spacecraft separated by around 144 m fly in a precise formation up to 5.5 hours at a time, which allows coronal observations in eclipse-like conditions, i.e. close to the limb (typically down to 1.099 Rs, occasionally down to 1.05 Rs) and with very low straylight. ASPIICS observes quasi-stationary structures, such as coronal loops, streamers, quiescent prominences, and a variety of dynamic phenomena: erupting prominences, coronal mass ejections, jets, slow solar wind outflows, coronal inflows. In particular, weak, widespread and persistent small-scale outflows and inflows between 1.3 and 3 Rs are observed at a high spatial (5.6 arcsec) and temporal (30 s) resolution for the first time, expanding the range of scales at which the variable slow solar wind is observed to form.",

Our objective is to analyse the morphology of these disks, and highlight their main properties. We adopt an analytical axisymmetric disk model to fit the observations and perform a regression on key disk parameters, namely the dust mass, the height profile, and the inclination. We use RADMC-3D code to produce synthetic observations of the analytical models, with full polarised scattering treatment. Both stars show resolved and extended disks with substructures in the near-IR. The disk of V721 CrA is vertically thicker, radially smaller (120 au), and brighter than BN CrA (190 au). It also shows spiral arms in the inner regions. The disk of BN CrA shows a dark circular lane, which could be either an intrinsic dust gap or a self-cast shadow, and a brightness enhancement along the disk minor axis. Both disks are compatible with the evolutionary stage of their parent subgroup within the CrA region: V721 CrA belongs to the \"on-cloud\" part of CrA, which is dustier, denser and younger, whereas BN CrA is found on the outskirts of the older \"off-cloud\" group.",

Shock and current-sheet dynamics and heating Quentin Noraz, Mats Carlsson, Guillaume Aulanier Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics, 15 pages, 10 figures + Appendix, abstract shortened for Arxiv Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The solar chromosphere is a crucial interface between the solar interior and its interplanetary environment, regulating how energy is locally deposited into heat and transported into the upper atmospheric layers. Despite significant progress, the dominant processes responsible for chromospheric heating remain debated, particularly under quiet-Sun (QS) conditions. We aim to disentangle and quantify the respective roles of shocks and current sheets (CS) in QS chromospheric modeling. We use a simulation performed with the radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code Bifrost. In order to identify shocks and CS events across space and time, we develop and apply physics-based criteria, allowing us to describe their dynamics and evaluate their contributions to both dissipative (viscous and ohmic) and mechanical (including compressive work) heating. Shocks are found to dominate the energy deposition in the lower chromosphere (up to $59\\%$ of the mechanical heating), while CS become the primary contributor in the upper chromosphere, as both plasma $\\beta$ and Mach number $Ma$ drop. Overall, $66\\%$ of the mechanical chromospheric heating is powered by the combined action of shocks and CS. These results support a multi-process view of the chromospheric heating in the QS, dominated by shocks, CS, and non-steep gradient dynamics. In addition to viscous and ohmic dissipation, compressive heating can play a major role locally in the model, particularly in chromospheric shock structures, where it offsets non-reversibly cooling from expansion and radiation, and therefore constitutes a key heating contribution to consider in the energy budget. This study further highlights the need for next-generation observations to resolve the intermittent and small-scale nature of chromospheric dynamics, in order to bring new constraints on the coupling between the different layers of the solar atmosphere.",

Although the explosion mechanism is not yet fully understood, theoretical models can reproduce optical observations and observed elemental abundances. However, many nuclear reaction rates involved in explosive nucleosynthesis have large uncertainties, impacting the reliability of abundance predictions. To address this, we have previously developed a Monte Carlo-based nucleosynthesis code that accounts for reaction rate uncertainties and has been applied to nucleosynthesis processes beyond iron. Our framework is also well suited for studying explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae. In this paper, we investigate 1D explosion models using the \"PUSH method\", focusing on progenitors with varying metallicities and initial masses around $M_\\mathrm{ZAMS} = 16 M_{\\odot}$. Detailed post-process nucleosynthesis calculations and Monte Carlo analyses are used to explore the effects of reaction rate uncertainties and to identify key reaction rates in explosive nucleosynthesis. We find that many reactions have little impact on the production of iron-group nuclei, as these elements are primarily synthesized in the nuclear statistical equilibrium. However, we identify a few \"key reactions\" that significantly influence the production of radioactive nuclei, which may affect astrophysical observables. In particular, for the production of ${}^{44}$Ti, we confirm that several traditionally studied nuclear reactions have a strong impact. However, determining a single reaction rate is insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion.",

Sellek Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Understanding dispersal of protoplanetary disks remains a central challenge in planet formation theory. Disk winds, driven by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and/or photoevaporation, are now recognized as primary agents of dispersal. With the advent of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), spatially resolved imaging of these winds, particularly in H2 pure rotational lines, has become possible, revealing X-shaped morphologies and integrated fluxes of $\\sim 10^{-16}$-$10^{-15}{\\rm \\,erg\\,s^{-1}\\,cm^{-2}}$. However, the lack of theoretical models suitable for direct comparison has limited interpretation of these features. To address this, we present the first model of photoevaporative \\ce{H2} winds tailored for direct comparison with JWST observations. Using radiation hydrodynamics simulations coupled with chemistry, we derive steady-state wind structures and post-process them to compute H2 level populations and line radiative transfer, including collisional excitation and spontaneous decay. Our synthetic images reproduce the observed X-shaped morphology with radial extents of $\\gtrsim 50$-$300{\\rm \\,au}$ and semi-opening angles of $\\sim 37^\\circ$-$50^\\circ$, matching observations of Tau 042021 and SY Cha. While the predicted line fluxes are somewhat lower than the observed values. These results suggest that photoevaporation is a viable mechanism for reproducing key features of observed H2 winds, including morphology and fluxes, though conclusive identification of the wind origin requires source-specific modeling. This challenges the reliance on geometrical structures alone to distinguish between MHD winds and photoevaporation. Based on our findings, we also discuss alternative diagnostics of photoevaporative winds. This work provides a critical first step toward interpreting spatially resolved H2 winds and motivates future modeling efforts.",

The detections yielded timings in agreement with the orbital elements derived from the earlier radial velocity measurements and eclipse depths of 70+/-12 ppm (CWW 89Ab) and 852+/-123 ppm (HSHJ 430b). While the high depth in the Kepler waveband for HSHJ 430b is in agreement with the assumption that the emitted flux comes mostly from the internal heat source and the absorbed stellar irradiation, the case of CWW 89Ab suggests very high albedo, because of the lack of sufficient thermal radiation in the Kepler waveband. Assuming completely reflective dayside hemisphere, without circulation, the maximum value of the eclipse depth due to the reflection of the stellar light is 56 ppm. By making the extreme assumption that the true eclipse depth is 3 sigma less than the observed depth, the minimum geometric albedo becomes ~0.6.",

Parker 19 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Substellar companions such as exoplanets and brown dwarfs exhibit changes in brightness arising from top-of-atmosphere inhomogeneities, providing insights into their atmospheric structure and dynamics. This variability can be measured in the light curves of high-contrast companions from the ground by combining differential spectrophotometric monitoring techniques with high-contrast imaging. However, ground-based observations are sensitive to the effects of turbulence in Earth's atmosphere, and while adaptive optics (AO) systems and bespoke data processing techniques help to mitigate these, residual systematics can limit photometric precision. Here, we inject artificial companions to data obtained with an AO system and a vector Apodizing Phase Plate coronagraph to test the level to which telluric and other systematics contaminate such light curves, and thus how well their known variability signals can be recovered. We find that varying companions are distinguishable from non-varying companions, but that variability amplitudes and periods cannot be accurately recovered when observations cover only a small number of periods. Residual systematics remain above the photon noise in the light curves but have not yet reached a noise floor. We also simulate observations to assess how specific systematic sources, such as non-common path aberrations and AO residuals, can impact aperture photometry as a companion moves through pupil-stabilised data. We show that only the lowest-order aberrations are likely to affect flux measurements, but that thermal background noise is the dominant source of scatter in raw companion photometry. Predictive control and focal-plane wavefront sensing techniques will help to further reduce systematics in data of this type.",

Characterizing the kinematic properties and identifying variable stars for the TESS stellar sample is crucial for revealing the correlations between the properties of planetary systems and the properties of stars (e.g., Galactic components, age, chemistry, dynamics, radiation). Based on data from TESS, Gaia DR3, and LAMOST DR10, we present a catalog of kinematic properties (i.e., Galactic positions, velocities, orbits, Galactic components, and kinematic age) as well as other basic stellar parameters for $\\sim 660,000$ TESS stars. Our analysis of the kinematic catalog reveals that stars belonging to different Galactic components (i.e., thin disk, thick disk, halo and 12 streams in the disk) display distinctive kinematic and chemical properties. We also find that hot planets with period less then 10 days in the TESS sample favor thin disk stars compared to thick disk stars, consistent with previous studies. Furthermore, using the LAMOST multiple-epoch observations, we identify 41,445 stars exhibiting significant radial velocity variations, among which 7,846 are classified as binary stars. By fitting the radial velocity curves, we further derive orbital parameters (e.g., mass ratio, orbital period and eccentricity) for 297 binaries. The observed decreasing orbital eccentricity with shorting period reveals evidence of tidal circularization. The catalogs constructed in this work have laid a solid foundation for future work on the formation and evolution of stellar and planetary systems in different Galactic environments.",

Using a global fit including our stellar parameters, radial velocities, and new TESS data, we derive refined properties of the planet orbiting HD 202772A, finding it to be the most irradiated hot Jupiter known in a wide binary. We also constrain the presence of additional transiting planets around HD 202772A and new transiting planets around HD 202772B using TESS photometry. We derive high-precision, strictly differential abundances for 27 species based on Gemini-GRACES spectra. HD 202772A shows lower lithium abundance (by 0.45 dex) relative to B, consistent with their stellar parameter differences. We also detect a small but significant enhancement in refractory elements in HD 202772A, particularly those with condensation temperatures above 1400 K (+0.018 $\\pm$ 0.004 dex). We explored several scenarios to explain the observed chemical anomalies. Our analysis suggests that rocky planet engulfment, primordial inhomogeneities, and $\\delta$ Scuti-related effects are unlikely to fully account for the chemical pattern. Instead, the differences observed in certain refractory elements might support atomic diffusion as the most plausible explanation.",

NUV radiation can severely impact the atmospheric and surface conditions of such planets, making characterization of NUV flaring activity a key aspect in determining habitability. We use archival data from the GALEX and XMM-Newton telescopes to study the flaring activity of M-dwarfs in the NUV. The GALEX observations form the most extensive dataset of M-dwarfs in the NUV to date, with exploitation of this data possible due to the new gPhoton2 pipeline. We run a dedicated algorithm to detect flares in the pipeline produced lightcurves and find some of the most energetic flares observed to date within the NUV bandpass, with energies of $\\sim10^{34}$ ergs. Using GALEX data, we constrain flare frequency distributions for stars from M0 to M6 in the NUV up to $10^5\\,$s in equivalent duration and $10^{34}$ ergs in energy, orders of magnitude above any previous study in the UV. We speculate the combined effect of NUV luminosities and flare rates of M4 and later stars could potentially allow abiogenesis on their habitable zone exoplanets. As a counterpoint, we estimate that the high frequencies of energetic UV flares and associated coronal mass ejections would inhibit the formation of an ozone layer, possibly preventing genesis of complex Earth-like lifeforms due to sterilizing levels of surface UV radiation. We also provide a framework for future observations of M-dwarfs with ULTRASAT, a wide FoV NUV telescope to be launched in 2027.",

Syst. 11(4), 045005 (2025) Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The Solar Low-Energy X-ray Spectrometer (SoLEXS) on board India's Aditya-L1 mission was launched on 2 September 2023 and commenced solar observations on 13 December 2023 following successful aperture cover deployment. Operating from the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrange point, SoLEXS has been providing continuous Sun-as-a-star soft X-ray spectroscopy across 2-22 keV with 170 eV resolution at 5.9 keV and 1-second temporal cadence since 6 January 2024. The instrument employs two Silicon Drift Detectors with aperture areas of 7.1 mm$^2$ and 0.1 mm$^2$ to accommodate the full dynamic range of solar activity from A-class to X-class flares. This paper presents comprehensive ground and on board calibration procedures that establish SoLEXS's quantitative spectroscopic capabilities. Ground calibration encompassed energy-channel relationships, spectral resolution characterization, instrument response functions, and collimator angular response measurements, with thermo-vacuum testing validating performance stability across operational temperature ranges. On board calibration utilizing an internal $^{55}$Fe source demonstrated preserved post-launch spectral resolution (164.9-171.2 eV), while cross-calibration with GOES-XRS and Chandrayaan-2/XSM confirmed radiometric accuracy and flux agreement. The instrument's 100% observational duty cycle at L1 enables unprecedented continuous monitoring of solar flare evolution across all intensity classes, providing calibrated data for advancing coronal heating mechanisms, flare energetics, and flare-coronal mass ejection relationship studies through soft X-ray spectroscopy.",

However, distant and long-period OC Cepheids remain limited, while the confirmed samples still require more precise determinations of their physical properties, such as ages and extinctions. In this work, we present a comprehensive census of OC Cepheids based on an extensive sample of distant OCs from Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3). By combining astrometric and photometric membership analyses, we identified 110 CCs associated with 102 OCs, of which 41 CCs across 37 OCs were classified as OC Cepheids, while the remaining cases were considered candidate or rejected associations. Our results are consistent with previous studies, while 4 of the 41 OC Cepheids are newly reported here. Using updated cluster parameters derived from manual isochrone fitting, we primarily refined the PAR to log Age = (-0.595 $\\pm$ 0.044) log P + (8.430 $\\pm$ 0.042) and recalibrated the PWR to WG = (-3.615 $\\pm$ 0.083) log P + (-2.379 $\\pm$ 0.096). This study expands the sample of confirmed and candidate OC Cepheids. The newly longest-period confirmed OC Cepheid is BM Per (CWNU 3123) with log P = 1.36, and two newly discovered OC Cepheid candidates have distances exceeding 6 kpc. Moreover, the PAR and PWR are improved by incorporating refined OC ages and updated parallaxes, respectively.",

Accepted for publication in PASP Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Ground-based astronomical observations will continue to produce resolution-limited images due to atmospheric seeing. Deconvolution reverses such effects and thus can benefit extracted science in multifaceted ways. We apply the Scaled Gradient Projection (SGP) algorithm for the single-band deconvolution of several observed images from the Zwicky Transient Facility and mainly discuss the performance on stellar sources. The method shows good photometric flux preservation, which deteriorates for fainter sources but significantly reduces flux uncertainties even for the faintest sources. Deconvolved sources have a well-defined Full-Width-at-Half-Maximum (FWHM) of roughly one pixel (one arcsecond for ZTF) regardless of the observed seeing. Detection after deconvolution results in catalogs with $\\gtrsim$99.6% completeness relative to detections in the observed images. A few observed sources that could not be detected in the deconvolved image are found near saturated sources, whereas for others, the deconvolved counterparts are detected when slightly different detection parameters are used. The deconvolution reveals new faint sources previously undetectable, which are confirmed by crossmatching with the deeper DESI Legacy DR10 and with Pan-STARRS1 through forced photometry. The method could identify examples of serendipitous potential deblends that exceeded SExtractor's deblending capabilities, with as extreme as $\\Delta m \\approx 3$ and separations as small as one arcsecond between the deblended components. Our survey-agnostic approach is better and eight times faster than Richardson-Lucy deconvolution and could be a reliable method for incorporation into survey pipelines.",

To meet these needs, a number of community supported alert brokers have been built, currently focused on processing of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; $\\sim 10^5$-$10^6$ alerts per night) with an eye towards Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST; $\\sim 2 \\times 10^7$ alerts per night). Building upon the system that successfully ran in production for ZTF's first seven years of operation, we introduce BOOM (Burst & Outburst Observations Monitor), an analysis framework focused on real-time, joint brokering of these alert streams. BOOM harnesses the performance of a Rust-based software stack relying on a non-relational MongoDB database combined with a Valkey in-memory processing queue and a Kafka cluster for message sharing. With this system, we demonstrate feature parity with the existing ZTF system with a throughput $\\sim 8 \\times$ higher. We describe the workflow that enables the real-time processing as well as the results with custom filters we have built to demonstrate the system's capabilities. In conclusion, we present the development roadmap for both BOOM and Babamul - the public-facing LSST alert broker built atop BOOM - as we begin the Rubin era.",

Reaching this precision requires mitigating variable atmospheric effects, especially gray extinction from clouds, which remains a major challenge. To address this challenge, we present a novel method for correcting photometric data using simultaneous radiometric measurements from an infrared thermal camera. The gray extinction correction model is fitted on an image-by-image basis as a function of thermal radiance excess and difference between synthetic and instrumental fluxes of calibration stars. This approach stands out by avoiding any assumptions about spatial structure and leveraging a forward model combining in situ environmental monitoring, radiative transfer simulations and use of Gaia Data Release 3 star catalogs. We demonstrate the method using data collected from a dedicated experimental remote observation system, built to conduct repeated observations of two fields over several nights in varying atmosphere conditions. We show that applying the correction model to each source in the test sample results in a reduction of residuals between corrected and reference magnitudes. It delivers extinction correction maps for individual images with a resolution of 2 arcmin and an accuracy of $\\sim$0.01 mag. This leads to a significant improvement in accuracy per image, with the mean absolute error decreasing from 0.64 to 0.11 mag for the most gray extinguished exposures. The temporal variations in extinction for non-ideal photometric sequences can be reduced to 0.025 mag per source, which is promising for its application in StarDICE.",

Rubin Observatory will capture light curves (LCs) for 10 billion sources and produce millions of transient candidates per night, necessitating scalable, accurate, and efficient classification. To prepare the community for this scale of data, the Extended LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC) sought to simulate a diversity of LSST-like time-domain events. Using a small transformer-based model and refined light curve encoding logic, we present a new state of the art classification performance on ELAsTiCC, with 71.8% F1 on LC-only classifications, and 89.8% F1 on LC+metadata classifications. Previous state of the art was 65.5% F1 for LC-only, and for LC+metadata, 84% F1 with a different setup and 83.5% F1 with a directly comparable setup. Our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art models for fine-grained early detection at all time cutoffs, which should help prioritize candidate transients for follow-up observations. We demonstrate label-efficient training by removing labels from 90% of the training data (chosen uniformly at random), and compensate by leveraging regularization, bootstrap ensembling, and unsupervised pretraining. Even with only 10% of the labeled data, we achieve 67.4% F1 on LC-only and 87.1% F1 on LC+metadata, validating an approach that should help mitigate synthetic and observational data drift, and improve classification on tasks with less labeled data. We find that our base model is poorly calibrated via reliability diagrams, and correct it at a minimal cost to overall performance, enabling selections by classification precision. Finally, our GPU-optimized implementation is 9x faster than other state-of-the-art ELAsTiCC models, and can run inference at ~33000 LCs/s on a consumer-grade GPU, making it suitable for large-scale applications, and less expensive to train.",

Sierra-Porta Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We present a feature-based framework to anticipate Forbush decreases (FDs) from one-minute neutron-monitor data by tracking sliding-window invariants from information theory, scaling, and geometry. For each station and event, we compute marker series (Shannon, spectral, permutation, sample and approximate entropy; Lempel-Ziv complexity; Hurst via DFA; correlation dimension; Higuchi, Katz, and Petrosian fractal dimensions), smooth them with an exponentially weighted moving average, and analyze within-station standardized derivatives relative to the time of the minimum of the smoothed count derivative. Leads are reported in minutes (negative = precedes) and station-level significance is defined on a pre-onset window via a robust z-score detector with bilateral threshold and persistence; no cross-correlation or hypothesis testing is required. Applied to three recent FDs (2023-04-23, 2024-03-24, 2024-05-10), a compact, robust panel-Hurst (DFA), Katz fractal dimension, Shannon and sample entropy, and Lempel-Ziv-consistently precedes the count derivative with substantial station coverage, yielding actionable lead times from tens to several hundred minutes depending on morphology. Some descriptors are event-dependent: permutation and spectral entropy are strongly anticipatory in the extreme May 2024 episode but closer to contemporaneous in the rapid March 2024 case. Heatmaps, violin plots, and station overlays corroborate these patterns. The approach is reproducible from open code, operates on native station units without cross-station homogenization, and is qualitatively stable to window, smoothing, and detector settings. These results support derivative-aligned invariant panels as practical early-warning tools that complement amplitude thresholds and enable nowcasting workflows in space-weather operations.",

These CRs will severely degrade image quality and further influence scientific analysis. Due to the CSST's sky survey strategy, traditional multi-frame stacking methods become invalid. The limited revisits prompted us to develop an effective single-image CR processing method for CSST. We retrained the DeepCR model based on CSST simulated images and achieved 97.90+-0.18% recall and 98.67+-0.05% precision on CR detection. Moreover, this paper puts forward an innovative morphology-sensitive inpainting method, which focuses more on areas with higher scientific value. We trained a UNet++ model especially on contaminated stellar/galactic areas, alongside adaptive median filtering for background regions. This method achieves effective for CRs with different intensities and different distances from centers of scientific targets. By this approach, the photometric errors of CR-corrected targets could be restricted to the level comparable to those of uncontaminated sources. Also, it increases the detection rate by 13.6% compared to CR masking. This method will provide a robust CR mitigation for next-generation space telescopes.",

Directly imaging an Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star requires reaching 10$^{-10}$ contrast levels and will be the goal of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). A key technical barrier to reaching such deep contrasts is maintaining wavefront stability on the order of tens of picometers, in particular in the presence of a segmented primary mirror. Keck Observatory is the only facility with all of the hardware components necessary for validating HWO segment phasing strategies: a large segmented primary mirror, capacitive edge sensors, deformable mirror, Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS), and high contrast science instruments. Taking advantage of these parallels, we are using Keck as a testbed for developing and validating HWO wavefront sensing and control loop strategies, as well as demonstrating the full system-level segment control architecture for HWO, using existing infrastructure. Recently, we set the stage for this work by using the ZWFS installed on the Keck II telescope to sense and correct the primary mirror segment pistons in closed-loop in parallel with science observations. This resulted in improved Strehl ratios on the NIRC2 science camera (Salama et al. 2024a). We now aim to directly address concerns related to control authority, actuator offload, and loop stability - tasks which require Keck's existing infrastructure, but which do not require picometer wavefront stability. Moreover, successful comparisons of observed and predicted performances will validate, on a real operating observatory, the HWO error budget methodology and in particular its approach to nested loops operating at multiple timescales.",

Table 4 summarize findings Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The subsolar point, the closest location on Earth's surface to the Sun, marks the Sun-Earth line of gravity that governs Earth's coupled orbital-rotational cycle. We examined the dynamic interactions among the Sun meridian declination (SMD), the Equation of Time (EoT), Earth's rotational speed (ER$_\\omega$) -- equatorial and with respect to the Sun -- and the path of the subsolar point (NBI) across longitude, including time derivatives up to the fourth order (snap). A central finding was that the function NBI$_\\alpha$(SMD) traces a lemniscate whose temporal structure mirrors the analemma, EoT(SMD), and whose symmetry converges to the obliquity component of the EoT. The EoT velocity ($\\omega^*$) peaks at solstices, troughs near the equinoxes, and crosses zero every mid-season. ER$_\\omega$ decreases monotonically along trans-equinoctial phases where the net drives of EoT and SMD coincide, and increases along trans-solstitial phases, where their net drives oppose. Eight sharp kinematic periods were identified for the cycle SMD-EoT-ER$_\\omega$: two equinoctial, two solstitial, and one within each season. The non-solstitial sharp terms, defined by ZCPs and troughs of $\\omega^*$, display a consistent 3$^\\circ$ northward offset from the function NBI$_\\alpha$(SMD). These results reveal a direct dynamical link between SMD, EoT, and Earth's rotational speed, providing a novel framework for understanding Earth's rotation.",

This is the author-accepted version of a paper published in Nature (Accelerated Article Preview, 30th October 2025) Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The most abundant type of planet discovered in the Galaxy has no analogue in our Solar System and is believed to consist of a rocky interior with an overlying thick H2 dominated envelope. Models have predicted that the reaction between the atmospheric hydrogen and the underlying magma ocean can lead to the production of significant amounts of water. The models suffer however from the current lack of experimental data on the reaction between hydrogen and silicate melt at high pressures and temperatures. Here we present novel experimental results designed to investigate this interaction. Laser heating diamond anvil cell experiments were conducted between 16 and 60 GPa at temperatures above 4000 K. We find that copious amounts of hydrogen dissolve into the silicate melt with a large dependence on temperature rather than pressure. We also find that the reduction of iron oxide leads to the production of significant amounts of water along with the formation of iron-enriched blebs. Altogether, the results predict that the typical processes attending planet formation will result in significant water production with repercussions for the chemistry and structure of the planetary interior as well as the atmosphere.",

The goal is to assess whether this image-based approach can accurately differentiate astronomical phenomena and serve as a viable option for working with multi-band photometric light curves. We transformed each multi-band light curve into an image. These images serve as input to the SwinV2 model, which is pre-trained on ImageNet-21K. The datasets employed include the public Catalog of Variable Stars from the Massive Compact Halo Object (MACHO) survey, using both one and two bands, and the first round of the recent Extended LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC), which includes six bands. The performance of the model was evaluated on six classes for the MACHO dataset and 20 distinct classes of variable stars and transient events for the ELAsTiCC dataset. The fine-tuned SwinV2 achieved better performance than models specifically designed for light curves, such as Astromer and the Astronomical Transformer for Time Series and Tabular Data (ATAT). When trained on the full MACHO dataset, it attained a macro F1-score of 80.2 and outperformed Astromer in single-band experiments. Incorporating a second band further improved performance, increasing the F1-score to 84.1. In the ELAsTiCC dataset, SwinV2 achieved a macro F1-score of 65.5, slightly surpassing ATAT by 1.3.",

Cowan, Ben Coull-Neveu (McGill University) 8 pages, 5 figures, Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) ESA's Ariel mission will be uniquely suited to performing population-level studies of exoplanets. Most of these studies consist of quantifying trends between an Ariel-measured quantity, y, and an a priori planetary property, x; for example, atmospheric metallicity as inferred from Ariel transit spectroscopy vs. planetary mass. The precision with which we can quantify such trends depends on the number of targets in the survey and their variance in the a priori parameter. We define the leverage of a survey with N targets as L = sqrt(N)stdev(x) and show that it quantitatively predicts the precision of population-level trends. The target selection challenge of Ariel can therefore be summarized as maximizing L along some axes of diversity for a given cumulative observing time. To this end, we consider different schemes to select the mission reference sample for a notional three year transit spectroscopy survey with Ariel. We divide the exoplanets in the mission candidate sample into logarithmic classes based on radius, equilibrium temperature and host star temperature. We then construct a target list by cyclically choosing the easiest remaining target in each class. We find that the leverage on a single axis of diversity can be increased by dividing that axis into many classes, but this sacrifices leverage along other axes of diversity. We conclude that a modest number of classes, possibly only one, should be defined when selecting Ariel targets. Lastly, we note that the statistical leverage of the Ariel transit survey would be significantly increased if current candidate planets were confirmed. This highlights the urgency of vetting and confirming the easiest transmission and emission spectroscopy targets in the Ariel mission candidate sample.",

The model links on-orbit generation (solar arrays and wall-plug to optical), terrain-masked visibility and range, beam propagation with realistic divergence and jitter, and surface conversion with thermal and dust limits, returning delivered daily energy.

We place this result in context by comparing on the same daily-energy metric to surface photovoltaics (PV) with storage and to compact fission, and by showing how delivered energy scales nearly linearly with transmit power and as $D_{\\rm eff}^{2}$ via encircled-energy capture, with a multiplicative gain from visibility (constellations). The same framework indicates practical regimes already within reach: e.g., a 10\\,m effective-aperture optical phased array at $P_{\\rm tx}=100$\\,kW delivers $\\sim$30--50\\,kWh\\,day$^{-1}$ at polar sites with typical single-orbiter visibility, as quantified by the delivered-energy and sizing maps. Thus, laser beaming is mass-competitive where darkness or permanent shadow forces deep storage for PV, or where distributed and duty-cycled users can amortize a shared transmitter; compact fission retains advantage for continuous multi-kW baseload at fixed sites.",

Comments welcome! Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Context: The Solar System giant planets harbour a wide variety of moons. Moons around exoplanets are plausibly similarly abundant, even though most of them are likely too small to be easily detectable with modern instruments. Moons are known to affect the long-term dynamics of the spin of their host planets; however, their influence on warm exoplanets (i.e.\\ with moderately short periods of about $10$ to $200$~days), which undergo significant star-planet tidal dissipation, is still unclear. Aims: Here, we study the coupled dynamical evolution of exomoons and the spin dynamics of their host planets, focusing on warm exoplanets. Methods: Analytical criteria give the relevant dynamical regimes at play as a function of the system's parameters. Possible evolution tracks mostly depend on the hierarchy of timescales between the star-planet and the moon-planet tidal dissipations. We illustrate the variety of possible trajectories using self-consistent numerical simulations. Results: We find two principal results: i) Due to star-planet tidal dissipation, a substantial fraction of warm exoplanets naturally evolve through a phase of instability for the moon's orbit (the `Laplace plane' instability). Many warm exoplanets may have lost their moon(s) through this process. ii) Surviving moons slowly migrate inwards due to the moon-planet tidal dissipation until they are disrupted below the Roche limit. During their last migration stage, moons -- even small ones -- eject planets from their tidal spin equilibrium. Conclusions: The loss of moons through the Laplace plane instability may contribute to disfavour the detection of moons around close-in exoplanets. Moreover, moons (even those that have been lost) play a critical role in the final obliquities of warm exoplanets. Hence, the existence of exomoons poses a serious challenge in predicting the present-day obliquities of observed exoplanets.",

It has been proposed that solid grains can concentrate in the spiral arms of self-gravitating disks, leading to the formation of planetary embryos or cores that can greatly accelerate the process of planet formation. We perform hydrodynamic simulations of self-gravitating gas and even smaller dust grains than previously investigated in 3-dimensional shearing box simulations to explore the conditions necessary to form these planetary seeds. Focusing on small grains of dimensionless stopping time $\\mathrm{St}=0.01$ and shorter, we find that disk metallicities $Z \\gtrsim 0.02$ can overcome the disruptive effects of dust diffusion among these small dust grains. In the outer reaches of a gravitationally unstable disk, these models correspond to grains of approximately 1$\\,mm$ and lead to planetary embryos between 0.1 and 1 Earth mass. The formation of these planetary embryos could therefore reduce the time needed for planet assembly, particularly in the outer regions of the disk where coagulation timescales are longer and solid growth is limited.",

Biosignatures based on molecular identity, isotopic composition, or chiral excess require measurements that current and planned missions cannot provide. We introduce a new class of biosignatures, defined by the statistical organization of molecular assemblages and quantified using ecodiversity metrics. Using this framework, we analyze amino acid diversity across a dataset spanning terrestrial and extraterrestrial contexts. We find that biotic samples are consistently more diverse, and therefore distinct, from their sparser abiotic counterparts. This distinction holds for fatty acids as well, indicating that the diversity signal reflects a fundamental biosynthetic signature. It also proves persistent under space-like degradation. Relying only on relative abundances, this biogenicity assessment strategy is applicable to any molecular composition data from archived, current, and planned planetary missions. By capturing a fundamental statistical property of life's chemical organization, it may also transcend biosignatures that are contingent on Earth's evolutionary history.",

Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The Missing Mantle Problem refers to the apparent scarcity of olivine rich (A-type) asteroids in the main belt, despite expectations that such bodies should be common if differentiated parent bodies were widely disrupted. Conversely, A-types appear relatively more abundant among near-Earth asteroids. We present a revised estimate of the A-type abundance in the main belt by combining Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) reflectance spectra with near-infrared observations from NASA IRTF. We applied principal component analysis (PCA) to Gaia DR3 visible spectra to identify A-type candidates and confirmed a subset through IRTF spectroscopy. Using these data and literature results, we derived the A-type probability distribution as a function of DR3 principal components, and from this, estimated their abundance across heliocentric distances and collisional families. We find that A-types constitute (2.00 +/- 0.15)% of main-belt asteroids significantly higher than previous estimates. Some families, such as Vesta and Flora, show enhanced A-type fractions, while others (e.g. Themis, Hygiea) contain few or none. The elevated abundance in the Flora family supports the existence of an additional differentiated parent body in the inner belt, besides Vesta. These findings indicate that olivine-rich material is more widespread than previously thought, offering new constraints on the Missing Mantle Problem and on early Solar System differentiation processes.",

While prior studies have explored the thermal evolution of such early Earth scenarios under idealized, oxidizing conditions, the potential feedback between tidal heating driven by Earth--Moon orbital forcing and variable redox scenarios have not yet been explored in detail. We investigate whether tidal heating could have prolonged this early magma ocean phase and supported quasi-steady state epochs of global radiative equilibrium: periods of thermal balance between outgoing radiation and interior heat flux. Using the $\\texttt{PROTEUS}$ simulation framework, we simulate Earth's early evolution under a range of plausible tidal power densities, oxygen fugacities, and volatile inventories. Our results suggest that feedback between tidal heating and atmospheric forcing can induce substantial variation in magma ocean lifetimes, from $\\sim$30 Myr up to $\\sim$500 Myr, sensitive to interior redox conditions. Global radiative equilibrium epochs commonly arise across this range, lasting from $\\sim$2 to $\\sim$320 Myr, and typically occur from 24 Myr after the Moon-forming impact. Under oxidizing conditions, late-stage H$_2$O degassing promotes melt retention and sustained heating due to its significant contribution to greenhouse forcing. Weak tides increase the atmospheric abundance of H$_2$S and NH$_3$ and deplete CO. Therefore, the feedback between tides and atmospheric forcing induces a disequilibrium signature in the magma ocean atmosphere.",

In particular, the low bulk densities of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, compared to terrestrial planets in our solar system, require either substantial amount of volatiles to be present or a corefree scenario where the metallic core is fully oxidised. Here, using an updated metal-silicate partitioning model, we show that during core-mantle differentiation oxygen becomes more siderophile (iron-loving) implying larger planet radii. For the seven TRAPPIST-1 planets, however, we find that they are not sufficiently large to oxidise all the iron in the core, if they differentiate from an Earth-like composition. Oxygen partitioning in rocky worlds precludes coreless planets up to about 4 Earth masses. The observed density deficit in the TRAPPIST-1 planets, and more generally in M dwarf systems if confirmed by future observations, may be explained by system-dependent element budgets during planet formation, which are intrinsically linked to their stellar metallicity.",

This work provides a framework to characterize cloud and climate properties of close-in gas giants via transit depth asymmetries from the optical to the infrared (0.33 ...10 $\\mu$m). The AFGKM ExoRad 3D GCM grid provides gas temperature profiles for an ensemble of 50 tidally locked gaseous planets orbiting diverse host stars. It is combined with a detailed kinetic cloud formation model. The end result is a set of synthetic transit spectra and evening-to-morning transit asymmetries that span climate regimes: warm (T=800 K ... 1000K), intermediately hot (T=1200 K ... 2000 K) and ultrahot (T =2200 K ... 2600 K). WASP-39b observations suggest iron-free clouds with less abundant cloud condensation nuclei than previously expected. The ensemble study shows that clouds increase transit limb differences due to asymmetries in cloud coverage and by enhancing horizontal differences in the gas temperatures. For hot planets, evening-to-morning differences of up to 150 ppm are suggested in the optical and 100 ppm in the infrared (2-8 micron). For ultra-hot Jupiters, evening-to-morning transit differences are dominated by the morning cloud for a cloud-free evening limb: They are strongly negative in the PLATO band (0.5-1~$\\mu$m, -500 ppm), moderately negative in the near-infrared (1-1.5~$\\mu$m, -200 ppm) and moderately positive (+100 ppm) for $\\lambda > 2\\mu$m. For a partly cloudy evening terminator, the evening-to-morning transit asymmetry is moderately positive in the whole wavelength range. Warm Jupiter planets exhibit negligible transit asymmetries. PLATO and JWST transit asymmetry observations between 1-2 $\\mu$m are optimal to characterize cloudy planetary atmospheres around K -A stars. JWST observations are most effective for M star planets with transit differences > +500 ppm for 8-10 $\\mu$m.",

      "abstract": "Origins of Mercury's Big Heart of Iron: Exploring Pathways to Form High Core Mass Fraction (CMF) Planets via N-body Simulations Haniyeh Tajer, Ji Wang, Anna C. Childs, Noah Ferich, Tiger Lu, Hanno Rein Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Mercury's core mass fraction (CMF) is ~0.7, more than double that of the other rocky planets in the solar system, which have CMFs of ~0.3. The origin of Mercury's large, iron-rich core remains unknown. Adding to this mystery, an elusive population of \"Exo-Mercuries\" with high densities is emerging. Therefore, understanding the formation of Mercury and its exoplanetary analogs is essential to developing a comprehensive planet formation theory. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the high CMF of Mercury: (1) giant impacts during the latest stages of planet formation strip away mantle layers, leaving Mercury with a large core; and (2) earlier-stage iron enrichment of planetesimals closer to the Sun leads to the formation of an iron-rich planet. In this work, we conduct N-body simulations to test these two possibilities. Our simulations are focused on the solar system, however, we aim to provide a framework that can later be applied to the formation of high-CMF exoplanets. To investigate the giant impact scenario, we employ uniform initial CMF distributions. To address the other hypothesis, we use a step function with higher CMFs in the inner region. For a uniform initial CMF distribution, our results indicate that although erosive impacts produce iron-rich particles, without mechanisms that deplete stripped mantle material, these particles merge with lower-CMF objects and do not lead to Mercury's elevated CMF. However, a step function initial CMF distribution leads to the formation of a high-CMF planet alongside Earth-like planets, resembling the architecture of the terrestrial solar system.",

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 122 (44) e2503737122 (2025) Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Jupiter's poles feature striking polygons of cyclones that drift westward over time, a motion governed by beta-drift (vortex motion caused by the latitudinal variation of the Coriolis force). This study investigates how beta-drift and the resulting westward motion depend on the depth of these cyclones. Counterintuitively, shallower cyclones drift more slowly, a consequence of stronger vortex stretching. By employing a 2D quasi-geostrophic model of Jupiter's polar regions, we constrain the cyclones' deformation radius, a key parameter that serves as a proxy for their vertical extent, required to replicate the observed westward drift. We then explore possible vertical structures and the static stability of the poles by solving the eigenvalue problem that links the 2D model to a 3D framework, matching the constrained deformation radius. These findings provide a foundation for interpreting upcoming Juno microwave measurements of Jupiter's north pole, offering insights into the static stability and vertical structure of the polar cyclones. Thus, by leveraging long-term motion as a novel constraint on vertical dynamics, this work sets the stage for advancing our understanding of the formation and evolution of Jupiter's enigmatic polar cyclones.",

Seligman, Vivien Parmentier, David Sing Accepted for publication in Nature Astronomy. Expanded section \"Interpretation According to Conventional Practices\" Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Claims of detections of gases in exoplanet atmospheres often rely on comparisons between models including and excluding specific chemical species. However, the space of molecular combinations available for model construction is vast and highly degenerate. Only a limited subset of these combinations is typically explored for any given detection. As a result, apparent detections of trace gases risk being artifacts of incomplete modeling rather than robust identification of atmospheric constituents, especially in the low signal-to-noise regime. Using the sub-Neptune K2-18 b as a case study, we show that recent biosignature claims vanish when the model space is expanded, with numerous alternatives providing equally good or better fits. We demonstrate that the significance of a claimed detection relies on the choice of models being compared, and that model preference does not in itself imply the presence of a specific gas. We recommend treating model comparisons instead as relative adequacy tests, which should be supported by theoretical predictions and complementary metrics of statistical significance in order to attribute a signal to a particular gas.",

Accepted for publication on Astronomy & Astrophysics Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) In multiple-planet systems, gravitational interactions of exoplanets could lead to transit timing variations (TTVs), whose amplitude becomes significantly enhanced when planets are in or near mean-motion resonances (MMRs). In cases where both TTVs and radial velocity (RV) measurements are available, combined analysis can break degeneracies and provide robust planetary and system characterization, even detecting non-transiting planets. In this context, HIP 41378 hosts five confirmed transiting planets with periods ranging from 15 to over 542 days, providing a unique dynamical laboratory for investigating wide multi-planet systems analogous to the Solar System. In this study, we present an intensive space-based photometric follow-up of HIP 41378, combining 15 new CHEOPS observations with eight TESS sectors, alongside data from K2, Spitzer, HST, and HARPS. We dynamically modeled the TTVs and RV signals of the two inner sub-Neptunes via N-body integration. These planets, HIP 41378 b ($P_{b}$ = 15.57 days) and HIP 41378 c ($P_{c}$ = 31.71 days), are close to ($\\Delta\\sim1.8$ %) a 2:1 period commensurability. We report a clear detection of TTVs with amplitudes of 20 mins for planet b and greater than 3 hrs for planet c. We dynamically confirm the planetary nature of HIP 41378 g, a non-transiting planet with a period of about 64 days and a mass of about 7 $M_{\\oplus}$, close to a 2:1 commensurability with planet c, suggesting a possible MMR chain in the inner system. Our precise determination of the masses, eccentricities, and radii of HIP 41378 b and c enabled us to investigate their possible volatile-rich compositions. Finally, by leveraging on the last TESS sectors we constrained the period of HIP 41378 d to three possible aliases ($P_{d} =$ 278, 371, and 1113 days) suggesting that the system could be placed in a double quasi resonant chain, highlighting its complex dynamical architecture.",

Sturm 21 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Direct observations of exoplanet and brown dwarf companions with near-infrared interferometry, first enabled by the dual-field mode of VLTI/GRAVITY, provide unique measurements of the objects' orbital motions and atmospheric compositions. Here, we compile a homogeneous library of all exoplanet and brown dwarf K-band spectra observed by GRAVITY thus far. We re-reduced all the available GRAVITY dual-field high-contrast data and, where companions are detected, extract their ~2.0-2.4 $\\mu$m K-band contrast spectra. We then derived stellar model atmospheres for all employed flux references, which we used to convert the companion contrast into companion flux spectra. Solely from the resulting GRAVITY spectra, we extracted spectral types, spectral indices, and bulk physical properties for all companions. Finally, and with the help of age constraints from the literature, we also derived isochronal masses for most companions using evolutionary models. The resulting library contains R ~ 500 GRAVITY spectra of 39 substellar companions from late M to late T spectral types, including the entire L-T transition. Throughout this transition, a shift from CO-dominated late M- and L-type dwarfs to CH4-dominated T-type dwarfs can be observed in the K-band. The GRAVITY spectra alone constrain the objects' bolometric luminosity to typically within $\\pm$0.15 dex. The derived isochronal masses agree with dynamical masses from the literature where available, except for HD 4113 c for which we confirm its previously reported potential underluminosity. Medium-resolution spectroscopy of substellar companions with GRAVITY provides insight into the carbon chemistry and the cloudiness of these objects' atmospheres. It also constrains these objects' bolometric luminosities which can yield measurements of their formation entropy if combined with dynamical masses, for instance from Gaia and GRAVITY astrometry.",
