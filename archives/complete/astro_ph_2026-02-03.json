      "abstract": "Forecasting Constraints on Cosmology and Modified Gravitational-wave Propagation by Strongly Lensed Gravitational Waves Associating with Galaxy Surveys Anson Chen, Jun Zhang Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Gravitational lensing of gravitational wave (GW) will become the next frontier in studying cosmology and gravity. While time-delay cosmography using quadruply lensed GW events associated with optical images of the lens systems can provide precise measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), they are considered to be much rarer than doubly lensed events. In this work, we analyze time-delay cosmography with doubly lensed GW events for the first time. We generate mock doubly lensed GW events with designed sensitivity of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O5 network, with LIGO post-O5 upgrade, and with Einstein Telescope (ET) + Cosmic Explorer (CE) respectively, and select the events that can be associated with future galaxy surveys. Over 1000 realizations, we find an average of 0.2(2.4) qualified events with the LVK O5(post-O5) network. Whereas with the ET+CE network, we find an average of 73.2 qualified events over 100 realizations. Using the Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS) lens model, we jointly estimate waveform parameters and the impact parameter with doubly lensed GW signals, and then forecast the constraints on cosmological parameters and modified GW propagation by combining time-delay cosmography and the standard siren approach. The average posterior gives a constraint on $H_0$ with a relative uncertainty of $14\\%$, $10\\%$ and $0.42\\%$ in the $\\Lambda$CDM model for the LVK O5, LVK post-O5, and ET+CE network, respectively. While the LVK network gives uninformative constraints on the $(w_0,w_a)$ dynamical dark energy model, the ET+CE network yields a moderate constraint of $w_0=-1.02^{+0.31}_{-0.22}$ and $w_a=0.48^{+0.99}_{-1.54}$. In addition, our method can provide precise constraints on modified GW propagation effects jointly with $H_0$.",

Moffat Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We show that Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG-MOG) is observationally equivalent to the standard model $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model for all probes that depend on isotropic and linear gravitational dynamics, including galaxy rotation curves, cluster lensing, the linear matter power spectrum P(k), $\\sigma_8$, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This degeneracy arises from the scale-dependent effective gravitational coupling $G_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, which ensures identical background evolution, transfer functions, and linear growth. Consequently, all early-universe, low and intermediate scale cosmological observables are equally well described by STVG-MOG without invoking non-baryonic dark matter. We argue that the equivalence implies that isotropic cosmological data alone cannot establish the physical existence of dark matter. The degeneracy is broken only by observables sensitive to large-scale, anisotropic gravitational response. In particular, recent measurements of enhanced radio-galaxy and quasar number-count dipoles at gigaparsec scales probe a regime where $G_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ departs from its $\\Lambda$CDM limit, allowing STVG-MOG to generate anisotropic bulk flows, while preserving consistency with all isotropic constraints. These observations provide a concrete pathway for empirically distinguishing modified gravity from particle dark matter.",

Shapiro High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) While no gravitational-wave detection of subsolar mass black holes has been confirmed to date, a number of candidate detections invite us to speculate on the origin of such black holes should a detection be confirmed. It is generally assumed that the observation of a black hole with subsolar mass $M_{\\rm obs}$ would provide strong evidence for primordial black holes (PBHs). The mass $M_{\\rm PBH}$ of the PBH, however, does not necessarily have to be equal to $M_{\\rm obs}$, as it would in what we term a ``direct PBH scenario\". Instead, a black hole of mass $M_{\\rm obs}$ may form in a capture of a much smaller primordial black hole, $M_{\\rm PBH} \\ll M_{\\rm obs}$, by a dwarf star of mass $M_* \\simeq M_{\\rm obs}$, followed by the total consumption of the star by the PBH. We provide some rough estimates and demonstrate that such an ``indirect PBH scenario\" may also lead to significant populations of black holes with mass $M_{\\rm obs}$, especially in dwarf galaxies, and may be able to explain rare subsolar mass events.",

However, dedicated data-analysis pipelines for XMRI signals have not yet been established. In this work, we develop, for the first time, a hierarchical semi-coherent search pipeline for XMRIs tailored to space-based gravitational-wave detectors, with a particular focus on the TianQin mission. The pipeline combines a semi-coherent multi-harmonic $\\mathcal{F}$-statistic with particle swarm optimization, and incorporates a novel eccentricity estimation method based on the relative power distribution among harmonics. We validate the performance of the pipeline using simulated TianQin data for a Galactic center XMRI composed of a brown dwarf and Sgr A*. For a three-month observation, the pipeline successfully recovers the signal and achieves high-precision parameter estimation, including fractional uncertainties of $<10^{-6}$ in the orbital frequency, $\\lesssim10^{-3}$ in the eccentricity, $\\lesssim2\\times10^{-3}$ in the black-hole mass, and $\\lesssim10^{-3}$ in the black-hole spin. Our framework establishes a practical foundation for future XMRI searches with space-based detectors and highlights the potential of XMRIs as precision probes of stellar dynamics and strong-field gravity in the vicinity of supermassive black holes.",

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Accretion discs that are tilted with respect to their compact hosts can warp out-of-plane through general relativistic frame-dragging. Warp influences disc dynamics in ways that have been studied extensively, especially as regards instabilities that might lead to rapid angular-momentum cancellation between neighbouring rings of fluid and mass infall. We provide a review of warped-disc phenomena here, revisiting key hydrodynamical assumptions that impact calculations of the shear viscosity controlling instability thresholds. Relativistic effects at the level of gas-parcel orbits are included, as are external Lorentz forces applied by the compact primary's magnetic field. Semi-analytic analysis reveals that intense magnetic fields can bring about new branches of warp modes and avoided crossings that significantly reduce the perpendicular viscosity at sub-Eddington accretion rates. Critical strengths required for misaligned torques to tear a thin disc may thus relax for systems like neutron star X-ray binaries or radio-loud active galactic nuclei.",

      "abstract": "The Bondi universe: How negative mass drives the cosmological expansion Giovanni Manfredi, Jean-Louis Rouet, Bruce Miller Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We identify a new cosmological coincidence that parallels the well-known matter/dark-energy coincidence: the present-epoch transition of the universe from a weakly coupled (collisionless) to a strongly coupled (collisional) gravitational regime. Within a cosmological model containing equal amounts of positive and negative Bondi masses -- consistent with the weak equivalence principle and momentum conservation -- we show that this coupling transition naturally coincides with the shift from a coasting to an accelerating expansion. A linear response analysis of the corresponding Vlasov-Poisson system reveals that mixed positive-negative mass configurations are always unstable, with growth rates that increase at shorter wavelengths, thereby driving the system toward strong coupling. Using long-time, exact one-dimensional N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the universe undergoes three successive expansion phases: an initial ballistic regime, an intermediate random-walk acceleration driven by sporadic Bondi encounters, and finally a uniformly accelerating phase triggered by the formation of stable positive/negative mass pairs. The onset of this last phase occurs precisely when the coupling parameter crosses unity, linking the two cosmological coincidences through a single dynamical mechanism. These results suggest that cosmic acceleration may arise from the nonlinear dynamics of a gravitationally neutral mixed-mass universe, without invoking dark energy or a cosmological constant.",

Dinda, Roy Maartens Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Recent results from DESI BAO measurements, together with Planck CMB and Pantheon+ data, suggest that there may be a `phantom' phase ($w_{\\rm de}<-1$) in the expansion of the Universe. This inference follows when the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization for the dark energy equation of state $w_{\\rm de}$ is used to fit the data. Since phantom dark energy in general relativity is unphysical, we investigate the possibility that the phantom behaviour is not intrinsic, but effective -- due to a non-gravitational interaction between dark matter and non-phantom dark energy. To this end, we assume a physically motivated thawing quintessence-like form of the intrinsic dark energy equation of state $w_{\\rm de}$. Then we use a $w_0, w_a$ model for the \\emph{effective} equation of state of dark energy. We find that the data favours a phantom crossing for the effective dark energy, but only at low significance. The intrinsic equation of state of dark energy is non-phantom, without imposing any non-phantom priors. A nonzero interaction is favoured at more than $3\\sigma$ at $z\\sim0.3$.

In this work, we apply the Hartle-Thorne spacetimes to study the frequencies of the precession for both geodesic and non-geodesic (fluid) flows. We build on previous findings on the effect of the NS quadrupole moment, which revealed the importance of the interplay between the relativistic and classical precession. Because of this interplay, the widely used Lense-Thirring metric, linear in the NS angular momentum, is insufficient to calculate the behaviour of the precession frequency across an astrophysically relevant range of NS angular momentum values. We find that even for a moderately oblate NSs, the dependencies of the precession frequency on the NS angular momentum at radii within the innermost accretion region have maxima that occur at relatively low values of the NS angular momentum. We conclude that very different groups of accreting NSs -- slow and fast rotators -- can display the same precession frequencies. This may explain the lack of evidence for a correlation between the frequencies of the observed low-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations and the NS spin. In our work, we provide a full, general description of precession behaviour, and also examples that assume specific NS and quark star (MIT bag) equation of state.

While this tension is often discussed in terms of new physics or unmodeled systematics, the role of the assumed priors on the model parameters has received comparatively little attention. Recently, Desmond et al. (2025) pointed out that the commonly adopted flat prior on distance moduli upweights smaller distances and systematically favors high inferred values of the Hubble constant. Motivated by this observation, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian recalibration of the distance ladder, applying physically motivated priors uniformly to all distances, including the Milky Way Cepheids, which are incorporated directly into the joint fit. Together with a conservative treatment of the Gaia EDR3 residual parallax offset, the Hubble constant shifts from $H_0 = 73.0 \\pm 1.0 \\, \\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ to $H_0 = 70.6 \\pm 1.0 \\, \\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, reducing the Hubble tension from $5 \\, \\sigma$ to $2 \\, \\sigma$. Our results show that the assumed priors -- often treated as innocuous defaults -- may play a central role in the Hubble tension.

The LBT, with its MODS and LUCI instruments, produces spectra, which, when combined with our new analysis methodology, are capable of delivering He abundances in individual HII regions with uncertainties of approximately 2% or less. Archival LBT/MODS spectra of standard stars over a four-year period enable the determination of a wavelength-dependent uncertainty in the MODS spectral response, resulting in improved relative emission line uncertainties. An optimized sample of low-metallicity galaxies has been selected with the goal of producing a determination of $Y_{\\rm p}$ with a precision of $\\sim$ 0.5%, sufficient to provide an independent constraint on the effective number of neutrino families of $\\sim$ 3%.",

These regions have been observed and analyzed uniformly. We also describe a number of updates to our methodology, including updated helium emissivities. Enabled by the large, high-quality dataset, we examine our sample targets for potential systematic errors, which could bias their results. We perform a standard 95% confidence level $\\chi^2$ cut and find that a significantly larger fraction (47/54 = 87%) of our sample qualifies than for previous datasets. We also screen for quality and reliability, flagging targets which may introduce significant systematic errors, producing a dataset of 41 targets. In a significant breakthrough for the field, that dataset includes 15 high SNR targets with low metallicity (O/H < 4 $\\times$ 10$^{-5}$). Due to this low-metallicity dataset, for the first time, a weighted average for determining the primordial helium abundance (Y$_\\mathrm{p}$) is well-justified and produces a robust result. By weighted average of our 15 low-metallicity targets, we determine Y$_\\mathrm{p}$ = 0.2458 $\\pm$ 0.0013.

Pogge, Noah S. J. Rogers, Evan D. Skillman, Miqaela K. Weller 14 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, submitted to AAS journals Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) The primordial abundance of $^4$He plays a central role in big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The LBT $Y_{\\rm p}$ Project's new measurement of the primordial $^4$He mass fraction $Y_{\\rm p} =0.2458 \\pm 0.0013$ is the most precise determination to date. In this paper, we combine our new $Y_{\\rm p}$ value with the latest primordial deuterium measurement, and assess the consequences for cosmology. For Standard BBN, where the number of light neutrino species is fixed at $N_\\nu=3$, the single free parameter is the cosmic baryon density; the CMB measures this independently, with results consistent with each other. Combining $Y_{\\rm p}$ , D/H, BBN, and the CMB, gives the cosmic baryon-to-photon ratio $\\eta = (6.120 \\pm 0.038) \\times 10^{-10}$, corresponding to a baryon density parameter $\\Omega_{\\rm B} h^2 = 0.02236 \\pm 0.00014$. We then allow $N_\\nu$ to vary and thus measure relativistic species present during nucleosynthesis. We find $\\eta = (6.101 \\pm 0.044) \\times 10^{-10}$ or $\\Omega_{\\rm B} h^2= 0.02229 \\pm 0. 00016$, and $N_\\nu = 2.925 \\pm 0.082$, and for $N_\\nu \\ge 3$, $\\Delta N_\\nu= N_\\nu-3 \\le 0.125$ (95\\% CL) during BBN and the CMB. Our results demonstrate consistency with the Standard Model of particle physics, and with the standard cosmology that links BBN at $\\sim 1 \\ \\rm sec$ and the CMB at $\\sim 400,000$ yr.",

Although previous lens models relied on many multiply imaged galaxies, only six systems had spectroscopic redshifts prior to this work. Our lens model is constrained by a catalogue of 135 secure multiple images from 27 background galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, uniformly covering both subclusters and a wide redshift range of 0.9 - 6.7. We also provide a catalogue of 199 multiple image candidates. We model the cluster with Lenstool and incorporate several large-scale haloes, cluster members, the intracluster gas, and group-scale haloes surrounding the cluster core, motivated by spectroscopic studies of cluster member kinematics. We describe the main cluster component with a complex, elongated double-peaked distribution, and the subcluster with a single large-scale halo aligning closely with the brightest cluster galaxy ($4_{-2}^{+4}$ kpc). The uncertainty of the alignment is improved threefold with the addition of JWST systems. The addition of group-scale substructures, roughly following the two axes of cluster assembly, improves the fit to the multiple image positions and provides a physically motivated alternative to constant shear. Our lens model shows the closest agreement with previous studies in aperture mass profiles at $\\sim60$ kpc from the BCGs, but exhibits significant differences in the detailed mass distribution as a result of different lens-modelling strategies and adopted constraints. The differences are reflected in small but spatially coherent deviations between the new spectroscopic redshifts and redshifts predicted by earlier lens models.",

As a unifying framework, we consider the spherically symmetric inhomogeneous $\\Lambda$LTB model and use it as a set of \"glasses\" through which to reinterpret the Hubble, dipole, and dark-energy tensions. Large-scale spatial gradients in this model introduce anisotropic expansion and position-dependent observables, allowing local estimates of $H_{0}$ to shift, dipolar signatures to arise, and an apparently evolving dark-energy equation of state to be mimicked without invoking genuinely dynamical dark energy. We discuss how these effects are constrained once the full supernova, CMB, and large-scale-structure data sets are included, and argue that it remains unclear whether any single $\\Lambda$LTB configuration can simultaneously account for all major anomalies. More broadly, we highlight that cosmology currently lacks a widely accepted baseline model that is both theoretically well founded and capable of accommodating the Hubble and dark-energy tensions, leaving us without a true concordance framework for forecasting future surveys.",

In this work, we investigate the potential of Lyman $\\alpha$ (Ly$\\alpha$) emission to trace cosmic filaments at redshifts $z=2.5$ and $z=4$, and assess their potential for constraining the nature of dark matter. Our analysis shows that Ly$\\alpha$ filaments provide a promising observational probe of dark matter: at $z=4$, differences in filament smoothness and surface brightness serve as distinctive signatures between models.

The universe contains baryonic matter alone and neither dark matter nor dark energy. The two arbitrary functions of the scalar field characterizing the kinetic term and the self-interaction potential are set to $W(\\varphi)=-1$ and $V(\\varphi) = -\\Xi \\varphi$, respectively, with $\\Xi$ a positive constant. In the weak-field limit, the theory reduces to Refracted Gravity, a non-relativistic theory whose modified Poisson equation contains the scalar field $\\varphi$ that provides the gravitational boost required to describe the dynamics of galaxies and galaxy clusters without dark matter. In a flat, matter-dominated, homogeneous and isotropic universe the same scalar field $\\varphi$ drives the accelerated expansion of the universe and describes the observed redshift evolution of the Hubble-Lemaître parameter $H(z)$. However, in the equation of the growth factor of the linear perturbation theory, the form of $V(\\varphi)$ makes the coefficient of the source of the gravitational field proportional to $H^{-1}(z)$; therefore the gravitational field is strongly suppressed at early times and structure formation is delayed to redshift $z< 1$, in disagreement with the observation of formed galaxies at much larger redshifts. In addition, the form of $W(\\varphi)$ and a linear $V(\\varphi)$ imply that $\\varphi$ generates twice the gravitational boost on massive particles than on photons, with possible observable consequences on the gravitational lensing phenomenon. It remains to be investigated whether different choices of $W(\\varphi)$ and $V(\\varphi)$, that can still make the theory reduce to Refracted Gravity in the weak-field limit, might alleviate these problems.",

In this study we generate seeds for the above range of SMBHs in various background cosmologies. We consider cosmic timescales required for black hole growth provided by three general relativistic cosmological models ($\\Lambda$CDM, $\\omega$CDM and Dynamical Dark Energy(DDE) and the braneworld cosmology. The growth of SMBHs is studied through Eddington limited and super-Eddington accretion, where the accretion starts at z=30. It is found that growth of SMBHs by z=10 within Eddington limited accretion is possible through massive seeds $(M\\geq10^{4}M_{\\odot})$ in all cosmologies. Super Eddington accretion onto spinning black holes with mass of few tens of solar masses can result in SMBHs by z=10 in all cosmologies. The viable cosmologies considered here are found to be unable to strongly distinguish between the seed black hole masses. The seeds generated in this work are assumed to be of primordial origin in order to satisfy the criteria of formation of high redshift massive galaxies. The fraction of primordial black holes (PBHs) contributing to dark matter ($f_{PBH}$) and their corresponding number densities for the mass range ($10^{5}-10^{8}$) $M_{\\odot}$ are calculated in both seed effect and Poisson effect. In seed effect, PBHs of mass $\\geq 10^{7} M_{\\odot}$ contributes $\\leq 10^{-2}$ to the dark matter fraction. The evolution of gas mass inside a PBH seeded dark matter halo is studied. The ratio of black hole to stellar mass is also evaluated for star formation efficiency in the range (0.1-1) and found to be ($10^{-3}-1$) for $M_{BH}=10^{8} M_{\\odot}$ and ($10^{-2}-10$) for $M_{BH}=10^{9} M_{\\odot}$.",

Submitted to the Open Journal of Astrophysics. Comments welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) X-ray luminous cool-core (CC) galaxy clusters contain powerful cosmic ray (CR) sources. High-energy CRs powering GHz synchrotron lose energy rapidly, but long-lived (~Gyr-old) populations of 0.1-1 GeV CRs persist, propagating to ~100 kpc distances and radiating via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons. We explore observable consequences of such CR-IC emission. This produces remarkably thermal X-ray spectra, which could contribute significantly to emission in CC centers. These naturally connect to ultra-steep radio sources and radio mini-halos at younger ages, but become undetectable in most radio, hard-X-ray, and $\\gamma$-ray searches (though future imaging may detect them), while reproducing apparent density, temperature, entropy, and mass deposition rates of CCs. This would provide an alternative resolution of the cooling flow problem: clusters may appear as strong CCs because of strong CR-IC, while not actually cooling so rapidly. This predicts many observed correlations between AGN/jet properties, radio galaxy and minihalo properties, cooling radii, cavity radii and apparent X-ray cooling luminosity $L_{\\rm X,cool}$. Since $L_{\\rm X,cool}$ is actually from CR-IC, the observed radio-X-ray ($L_{\\rm radio}-L_{\\rm X,cool}$), apparent cavity power ($P_{\\rm cav}-L_{\\rm X,cool}-L_{\\rm radio}$), and strong CC-AGN correlations are predicted without free parameters. Since CR-IC leads to X-ray overestimates of thermal pressure, the ratio of SZ to X-ray pressures should drop in CC centers. CR-IC also suppresses abundances inferred from X-ray relative to optical/UV measurements in CC centers. Both of these appear to be seen in sufficiently-resolved CCs. Effects on cluster cosmology, hydrostatic mass estimation, and non-thermal pressure/turbulence estimators are small. Redshift evolution of CC surface brightness profiles could provide strong constraints or imply CR-IC at high-$z$.",

Strom 25 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables, submitted to AAS Journals Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Empirically measuring the primordial He mass fraction, $Y_{\\rm p}$, requires a significant number of low-metallicity nebulae with direct constraints on He/H and O/H abundances. This technique requires high-fidelity measurements of the gas-phase physical conditions, namely the electron temperature ($T_e$) and density ($n_e$). To this end, we present deep rest-optical spectroscopy for a sample of 62 low-metallicity ($\\lesssim$ 20% solar O/H) galaxies acquired using the Multi-Object Double Spectrographs (MODS) on the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) as part of the LBT $Y_{\\rm p}$ Project. We discuss new fitting methods that recover the intensity of up to 61 H and He recombination lines, of which, up to 26 will be used to determine gas-phase He abundances, and we examine the emission line properties of the LBT $Y_{\\rm p}$ Project sample. We assess different scaling relations in the low-metallicity interstellar medium (ISM), finding that $n_e$[Ar IV] measured in 31 targets is systematically larger than $n_e$[S II] or $n_e$[O II]. The larger densities are insufficient to significantly bias $T_e$[O III] or the O/H abundance. $T_e$[S III] and $T_e$[O III] are strongly correlated over a range of $\\sim$10$^4$ K with very low scatter, and we calibrate new $T_e$[S III]-$T_e$[O III] scaling relations for use in other low-metallicity environments. We examine different $T_e$ measured in the low-ionization gas, finding significant scatter compared to $T_e$[O III]. The precision direct O/H derived in this analysis (median uncertainty $\\sim$4%) are consistent with prior literature measurements, albeit with relatively large scatter. These data provide a key component necessary to empirically measure $Y_{\\rm p}$ and the abundance patterns of other elements in the ISM.",

Miller Jr., Jayde Spiegel 9 Pages, 4 Figures, 1 Table, Submitted to AAS Journals Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Accurately determining the elemental abundances of a low metallicity nebula strongly depends on measuring the density (n$_e$) and temperature (T$_e$) of the gas. Because these two parameters are inherently degenerate when derived solely from H and He recombination lines, we rely on the density-sensitive HeI $\\lambda$10830 line to assist in resolving this issue, especially for accurate He abundances. To facilitate this, we present near-IR (NIR) LUCI spectra of 48 low-metallicity targets from the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) and homogeneously reduce them using Pypeit as part of the LBT $Y_{\\rm p}$ Project. IR spectra require special care, and we wavelength calibrate by-hand using the bright OH emission lines, carefully apply proper telluric corrections, and co-add the spectra of LUCI1 and LUCI2 on a resampled grid to ensure accurate results. We use a Gaussian profile to fit the emission lines and measure the fluxes relative to Paschen-gamma (P$\\gamma$), resulting in HeI $\\lambda$10830 to P$\\gamma$ ratios consistent with previous studies. As a result, this work significantly expands the available dataset of NIR HeI $\\lambda$10830 fluxes in low metallicity galaxies. These high-quality measurements, where we find a median flux ratio uncertainty of $\\widetilde{\\sigma} = 0.08$, reduce the overall uncertainties in helium abundance estimates for individual targets. The increased size of the high-quality sample enables searching for systematic uncertainties and improves the reliability of the helium abundance determinations used to infer the primordial helium abundance ($Y_{\\rm p}$).",

Assuming isothermal intracluster gas, the hydrostatic masses are $\\log(M_{500}/M_\\odot)=14.76$ for PSZ-E and 14.54 for PSZ-W, implying a mass ratio of $\\sim 1:1.7$. PSZ-E shows X-ray concentration indices of $c_{40}/c_{400}=0.124$ and $c_{100}/c_{500}=0.278$, together with a centroid shift of $w=0.016$, indicating a disturbed halo that still hosts a compact cool core; PSZ-W is comparably disturbed even in its core. Both subclusters exhibit ICM asymmetries consistent with ram-pressure stripping, and PSZ-W displays an X-ray tail extending nearly to the outskirts of PSZ-E. The orientation and length of this tail support an off-axis merger geometry. Thermodynamic maps reveal a hot ($\\sim 7.3$ keV), high-pressure, high-entropy bridge between the cores. From the Rankine-Hugoniot temperature jump, we infer a Mach number $M=1.41^{+0.33}_{-0.30}$, consistent with a weak merger shock propagating at $1620^{+500}_{-420}$ km s$^{-1}$. These results indicate a merger with a non-zero impact parameter, likely observed near core passage ($\\lesssim 0.5$ Gyr before or after), with the pre-pericenter scenario slightly preferred based on the projected separation and thermodynamic structure.",

The wide, low-redshift coverage of J-PAS and the high-density, high-redshift mapping of PFS are strongly complementary: combining the two reduces marginalized uncertainties on all primary parameters compared with either survey individually. Adding the joint J-PAS+PFS data to next-generation CMB measurements from the Simons Observatory (SO) and \\textsc{LiteBird} yields an expected precision of $\\sigma(\\sum m_\\nu)=0.017\\,$eV in the $\\Lambda$CDM$+\\sum m_\\nu+N_{\\rm eff}$ framework, sufficient to disfavour the inverted neutrino hierarchy at $2.34\\,\\sigma$ if the true mass sum equals the normal-ordering minimum. Motivated by recent DESI results, we also forecast within a $w_0w_a$CDM$+\\sum m_\\nu+N_{\\rm eff}$ cosmology, adopting the DESI\\,DR2 best-fit values ($w_0=-0.758$, $w_a=-0.82$) as fiducial. The combination CMB+J-PAS+PFS then delivers $\\sigma(w_0)=0.044$ and $\\sigma(w_a)=0.18$, corresponding to a $5.1\\,\\sigma$ preference for a time-varying dark-energy equation of state.

      "abstract": "Non-Separable Halo Bias from High-Redshift Galaxy Clustering Emy Mons, Vipul Prasad Maranchery, M. S. Suryan Sivadas, Charles Jose Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The halo model provides a powerful framework for interpreting galaxy clustering by linking the spatial distribution of dark matter haloes to the underlying matter distribution. A key assumption within the halo bias approximation of the halo model is that, on sufficiently large scales, the halo bias between two halo populations is a separable function of the mass of each population. In this work, we test the validity of this approximation on quasi-linear scales using both simulations and observational data across a broad range of halo masses and redshifts. In particular, we define a separability function based on halo or galaxy cross-correlations to quantify deviations from halo bias separability, and measure it from N-body simulations. We find significant departures from separability on quasi-linear scales (\\(\\sim 1\\text{--}5\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}\\)) at high redshifts (\\(z \\geq 3\\)), leading to a suppression in the scale-dependent halo bias and hence in halo cross-correlations by up to a factor of 2 -- or even higher. In contrast, deviations at low redshifts remain modest. Additionally, using high-redshift (\\(z \\sim 3.6\\)) galaxy samples, we detect deviations from bias separability that closely align with simulation predictions. The breakdown of the separable bias approximation on quasi-linear scales at high redshifts underscore the importance to account for non-separability in models of the galaxy-halo connection in this regime. Furthermore, these results highlight the potential of high-redshift galaxy cross-correlations as a probe for improving the galaxy-halo connection from upcoming large-scale surveys.",

Version published in JCAP Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We initiate a systematic study of the perturbative nonlinear dynamics of cosmological fluctuations in dark sectors comprising a fraction of non-cold dark matter, for example ultra-light axions or light thermal relics. These mixed dark matter scenarios exhibit suppressed growth of perturbations below a characteristic, cosmologically relevant, scale associated with the microscopic nature of the non-cold species. As a consequence, the scale-free nonlinear solutions developed for pure cold dark matter and for massive neutrinos do not, in general, apply. We thus extend the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure to model the coupled fluctuations of the cold and non-cold dark matter components, describing the latter as a perfect fluid with finite sound speed at linear level. We provide new analytical solutions wherever possible and devise an accurate and computationally tractable prescription for the evaluation of the one-loop galaxy power spectrum, which can be applied to probe mixed dark matter scenarios with current and upcoming galaxy survey data. As a first application of this framework, we derive updated constraints on the energy density in ultra-light axions using a combination of Planck and BOSS data. Our refined theoretical modeling leads to somewhat weaker bounds compared to previous analyses.",

D 113, 023504 (2026) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The standard $\\Lambda$CDM model, despite its success, is challenged by persistent observational tensions in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the matter clustering amplitude ($S_8$), motivating the exploration of alternative cosmological scenarios. We investigate a dark energy model with a phenomenological interaction in the dark sector, constructed to be exactly degenerate at the background level with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization. This setup allows us to test whether models with identical expansion histories but distinct physical mechanisms can be distinguished by cosmological data. We perform a Bayesian analysis using a combination of recent datasets: DESI DR2 BAO measurements, DESY5 supernovae, and CMB data from Planck and ACT. We find that both the interacting model and the CPL model provide significantly better fits to the data than $\\Lambda$CDM. Although indistinguishable in background observables, the interacting model predicts a distinct matter-sector evolution driven by a late-time sign change in the dark sector interaction at $z \\approx 0.8$, corresponding to the $w=-1$ crossing in the CPL description. In this sense, the interacting picture may be considered more physical, since it avoids the problematic crossing by construction. The resulting decay of dark energy into dark matter lowers $S_8$, potentially alleviating the weak-lensing $S_8$ tension. At the same time, it predicts a sharp suppression of the growth rate $f\\sigma_8(z)$ at $z \\lesssim 0.8$, which is in tension with current measurements of structure formation. This indicates that the model may not simultaneously reconcile the expansion history and the observed growth of cosmic structure, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive analysis to fully assess its viability.",

In addition to oscillations from the Ly$\\alpha$--Si III cross correlation that are damped toward smaller scales, we find an enhancement in small-scale power that has been ignored in previous studies. We therefore develop a new analytical fitting function that captures two critical effects that have previously been neglected: distinct Ly$\\alpha$ and Si III line profiles, and a variable ratio for coeval Ly$\\alpha$ and Si III optical depths. In contrast to earlier work, we also predict amplitudes for the Si III power spectrum and Ly$\\alpha$--Si III cross power spectrum that decrease toward lower redshift due to the hardening metagalactic UV background spectrum at $z\\lesssim 3.5$. The fitting function is validated by comparison against multiple simulated datasets at redshifts $2.2\\leq z \\leq 5.0$ and wavenumbers $k < 0.2\\rm\\,s\\,km^{-1}$.

A standard numerical approach involves injecting magnetic helicity at intermediate length scales to generate a secondary, time-dependent spectral peak that gradually propagates toward larger scales. Previous simulations have already suggested a resistive dependence of inverse transfer rates and demonstrated the significant influence of magnetic helicity flux density $\\epsilon_\\mathrm{H}$ on this process. On dimensional grounds, we have $E_\\mathrm{M}(k,t)=C_\\mathrm{H} \\epsilon_\\mathrm{H}^{2/3} k^{-1}$ where $C_\\mathrm{H}$ represents a potentially universal dimensionless coefficient analogous to the Kolmogorov constant. We present a summary of the 25 distinct simulations conducted with the \\textsc{Pencil Code}, systematically varying the forcing wavenumber $k_\\mathrm{f}$, magnetic Prandtl number $Pm$, grid resolution $N^3$, and Lundquist number $Lu$. We obtained $C_\\mathrm{H}$ and corresponding error bars by calculating the compensated spectrum and investigated its dependence with $Lu$ and $k_\\mathrm{f}$.

In this work, we investigate the influence of gravitational lensing on the SGWB, focusing on primordial black holes (PBHs) as potential lenses. Assuming PBHs as dark matter candidates with a broad cosmic distribution, we show that their lensing optical depth can be significantly enhanced, producing pronounced effects with relative deviations at the 10^-1 level. By systematically varying the PBH mass (M_PBH) and abundance (f_PBH), we demonstrate that the mass predominantly determines the frequency-dependent diffraction features of the spectrum, while the abundance primarily amplifies the overall lensing-induced deviation. Although the SGWB from binary black holes has not yet been observed, our analytical results provide theoretical insight into the possible imprint of lensing on its spectrum and suggest that future detections could offer a novel avenue to constrain dark matter scenarios.",

This is a direct consequence of lensing being a projected effect. In this paper, we demonstrate how the noise complexity -- often deemed \"erasing the signal\" -- induced by a particular de-projection technique, the Bernardeau-Nishimichi-Taruya (BNT) transform arXiv:1312.0430, can be used to extract the BAO signal and non-gaussian aperture-mass-like properties at chosen physical scales. We take into account parts of the data vectors that should effectively be without cosmological signature and also introduce an additional re-weighting designed to specifically highlight clustering features -- both at the probe (summary statistics) or map (amplitude of the field) level. We thus demonstrate why weak-gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure of the Universe, though only in a tomographic setting, does not erase scale and time-dependent features of the dynamics of matter, while providing a tool to effectively extract them from actual galaxy-shapes measurements.",

Additional citations Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Knowledge of the actual density distribution of matter in the local universe is needed for a variety of purposes -- for instance, as a baseline model for ultrahigh energy cosmic ray sources in the continuum limit and for predicting the diffuse Dark Matter annihilation signal. Determining the local mass density and velocity distribution is the aim of the CosmicFlows project. An alternate approach is based on catalogs of galaxies, supplemented with some scheme for filling in for unseen galaxies. Here, we compare the density field proposed by Biteau (2021) with the quasi-linear density field of CosmicFlows2 (Hoffman et al. 2018) and the mean posterior field of CosmicFlows4 (Valade 2026). We find factor-two level differences in some regions and even greater in regions toward the Galactic center zone of avoidance (ZoA) (|l| < 30°, |b| < 20°) as filled by Biteau using \"cloning\". Within 11 Mpc the density field is well-determined by the Local Volume catalog (Karachentsev et al. 2018) which Biteau directly incorporates; at larger distances, Biteau (2021) should not be used in the ZoA where \"galaxies\" are entirely fictitious but otherwise is to be preferred over CosmicFlows emphasizing the direction and integrated mass of structures; the radial distribution of mass in Biteau (2021) is less robust due to line-of-sight peculiar velocities. The angular positions of structures in CosmicFlows are sometimes not congruent with evidence in the galaxy catalog.",

To achieve this, we augment the existing dataset by adding redshift data from our deep MMT/Hectospec survey and from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), significantly improving the spectroscopic completeness down to $r_{\\mathrm{petro},0} = 20.8$ within the central $30^\\prime$ region. The resulting luminosity function is well described by a Schechter function with a characteristic magnitude $M^* = -21.30 \\pm 0.27$ and a faint-end slope $\\alpha = -1.23 \\pm 0.05$. This faint-end slope is consistent with those measured in the nearby Coma and Virgo clusters and in a cluster from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, and is slightly shallower than that of field galaxies. These findings indicate that the previously claimed steep faint-end upturn (with $\\alpha \\sim -2$) in nearby galaxy clusters is not supported. Instead, they indicate that environmental processes in dense cluster cores does not seem to trigger the formation or survival of low-mass galaxies, thereby preventing a steep faint-end upturn in the luminosity function.",

How density fluctuations explain the Mach number discrepancy, microgauss magnetic fields, and spectral index variations Joseph Whittingham, Christoph Pfrommer, Maria Werhahn, Léna Jlassi, Philipp Girichidis 29 pages, 23 figures. Published in A&A. The abstract has been abridged to fit within the allowed character limit High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) It is generally accepted that radio relics are the result of synchrotron emission from shock-accelerated electrons. Current models, however, are still unable to explain several aspects of their formation. In this paper, we focus on three outstanding problems: i) Mach number estimates derived from radio data do not agree with those derived from X-ray data, ii) cooling length arguments imply a magnetic field that is at least an order of magnitude larger than the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM), and iii) spectral index variations do not agree with standard cooling models. To solve these problems, we first identify typical shock conditions in cosmological simulations, using the results to inform significantly higher resolution shock-tube simulations. We apply the cosmic ray electron spectra code CREST and the emission code CRAYON+ to these, thereby generating mock observables ab-initio. We identify that upon running into an accretion shock, merger shocks generate a shock-compressed sheet, which, in turn, runs into upstream density fluctuations in pressure equilibrium. This mechanism directly gives rise to solutions to the three problems: it creates a distribution of Mach numbers at the shock-front, which flattens cosmic ray electron spectra, thereby biasing radio-derived Mach number estimates to higher values. We show that this effect is particularly strong in weaker shocks. Secondly, the density sheet becomes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable at the contact discontinuity, causing turbulence and additional compression downstream. This amplifies the magnetic field from ICM-like conditions up to microgauss levels. We show that synchrotron-based measurements are strongly biased by the tail of the distribution here too. Finally, the same instability also breaks the common assumption that matter is advected at the post-shock velocity downstream, thus invalidating laminar-flow based cooling models.",

Datasets available at this https URL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We release CosmoDC2_BCO, a synthetic catalog of gravitational-wave events and electromagnetic counterparts associated with galaxies from CosmoDC2. The catalog provides intrinsic and extrinsic source parameters, signal-to-noise ratios, parameter uncertainties, sky localization areas, and kilonova apparent magnitudes in LSST filters. Our results show that third-generation detector networks substantially increase detection rates and improve parameter estimation. Second-generation detectors, when combined with third-generation ones, significantly enhance sky localization and distance precision, particularly for BNS mergers. Assuming a simplified Target of Opportunity strategy, we estimate that an LSST-like survey, partnered with the CE+ET+LVK network at 70% duty cycle, could detect about 5000 kilonovae with GW counterparts over a 10-year period on a 16000 deg^2 footprint, predominantly from low-mass BNS mergers that produce long-lived supermassive neutron star remnants. While this is a substantial number, it represents only a small fraction of the total neutron star mergers expected to be observed by third-generation networks. These projections rely on several simplifying assumptions-including the adopted merger rate, the kilonova luminosity distribution, and the configuration and scheduling of future surveys-which introduce notable uncertainties. Therefore, the estimated detection numbers should be interpreted with appropriate caution.",

In this work, we perform a detailed investigation into whether this event could originate from the diffuse neutrino flux produced by a class of pulsar-powered optical transients. In particular, we consider populations of ordinary supernovae (SNe), super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe), and luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) with a newly formed magnetar as the central engine. We discuss both the thermal electromagnetic and non-thermal neutrino emission from such sources. We scan the parameter space of the dipolar magnetic field strength and the initial spin period to determine characteristic optical emission properties and lightcurve timescales of these transients. Additionally, our scan identifies which classes of these transients can reproduce the required diffuse flux level and neutrino energies. Combining our results, we conclude that a diffuse neutrino flux from a population of LFBOTs can explain the KM3NeT event. Therefore, pulsar-powered optical transients may serve as promising sources for the current and upcoming high-energy and ultra-high energy neutrino telescopes.",

While matter accretion onto supermassive black holes is long thought to accelerate particles to high energies, it has recently been suggested that tidal disruption events, and accretion flares in general, with prominent IR echoes can account for a fraction of the diffuse high-energy neutrino signal. Motivated by this result, we compile a sample of nearby accretion flares detected in the NEOWISE survey featuring strong IR echoes, and we cross-match it with the latest catalog of neutrino alerts, IceCat-1. We recover only a single spatial coincidence between the two catalogs, consistent with a chance coincidence. We find no temporal and spatial coincidences between the two samples, which, given the properties of our sample, appears to challenge previous conclusions.

Re-submitted to A&A after addressing initial referee comments, comments welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) XRISM has provided an unprecedented view of the emission and absorption lines in the X-ray. Notably, early results showed significant complexity to the Fe-K$\\alpha$ line profile in AGN, with clear contributions from at least three emitting structures: an inner disc, intermediary broad line region (BLR) scale material, and an outer torus. This poses a new challenge for the modelling of the emission lines, as while fast sophisticated models exist for disc line-profiles, large scale-height material is typically much more complex. In this paper we aim to address this gap, by building a fully analytic model for the emission line profiles from a wind, aimed towards BLR scale material, motivated on previous reverberation studies suggesting a wind on the inner edge of the BLR. Our approach gives a physically motivated, yet computationally fast, model for the intermediary component to the Fe-K$\\alpha$ complex seen in the XRISM data. We demonstrate our model on the XRISM observations of NGC 4151 from the performance verification phase, showing that it gives a good description of the data, with physically reasonable parameters for BLR scale material. We also show that our model naturally gives the smooth line profile seen in the data, due to the large spatial extent of a wind. Finally, we make our model code public to the community, and name it xwind.",

      "abstract": "A Formation Crisis of Repeating Partial Tidal Disruption Events Zhen Pan, Dong Lai High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) A number of candidate repeating partial tidal disruption events (rpTDEs) have been reported in recent years. If these events are confirmed, the high fraction of observed rpTDEs among all tidal disruption events (TDEs) is in tension with prediction of the loss cone channel. We further point out an inequality $M_\\bullet \\lesssim 4\\times 10^6 M_\\odot (T_{\\rm obt}/10\\ {\\rm yr})^{4/9}$ that must be satisfied for rpTDEs of solar type stars in the loss cone channel, where $M_\\bullet$ is the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass and $T_{\\rm obt}$ is the orbital period of the star. However the majority of reported rpTDE candidates potentially violate this inequality, indicating an alternative formation channel. In the commonly invoked Hills mechanism, the captured stars produced by tidal disruption of near-contact binaries can evade this inequality and may be the dominant source of rpTDEs. If the same process operates in the Galactic Center, there should exist a population of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) ejected with velocities as high as $3.6\\times 10^3 (M_\\bullet/10^6 M_\\odot)^{1/6}\\ {\\rm km\\ s}^{-1}$, which however have not been detected.

However, classical accretion theory applicable to such hot accretion flows treats spherically symmetric Bondi accretion and disc-like advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) as two distinct limiting cases, lacking a unified framework for flows with finite angular momentum. In this work, we develop such a framework that continuously connects these two regimes. Our model naturally recovers the Bondi solution in the limit of vanishing angular momentum and approaches the properties of classical ADAFs at high angular momentum, while providing a physically well-defined description of the intermediate regime where neither limiting case is strictly applicable. We further demonstrate that the accretion rate is jointly regulated by the angular momentum of the ambient gas and the gas viscosity. For sufficiently large but physically reasonable viscosity, the accretion rate can remain at a significant fraction of the Bondi rate even in the presence of substantial gas rotation. These results offer a natural explanation for how such accretion rates can be sustained despite finite angular momentum in realistic galactic environments.",

Kimura, Kohta Murase, Bing Theodore Zhang High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are one of the most extreme transients in the universe, but their explosion and emission mechanism remains unclear. To investigate the nature of GRB jets, here we focus on X-ray flares (XFs) and extended emissions (EEs), which are X-ray emissions that occur 100 to 1000 seconds after the main burst. They can be observed by recently developed multi-wavelength facilities. In this paper, we calculate emissions across multi-wavelengths associated with XFs and EEs under the hypothesis that XFs and EEs are optically-thin synchrotron emissions from nonthermal electrons in relativistic jets. Considering ranges of the dissipation radius $r_{\\rm diss}$ and the Lorentz factor $\\Gamma$ of the jet, we determine the parameter space in which a detectable emission can be produced at each wavelength. We found that simultaneous ultraviolet and very-high-energy gamma-ray emission associated with XFs or EEs can be detected by Swift/UVOT, SVOM/VT, and CTAO approximately every three years. The detection and non-detection rates for each detector are key to determining the uncertain yet essential values necessary for understanding the physics of GRB jets.",

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop and implement a method for correcting monitoring data, the key point of which was to obtain reception coefficients as a function of latitude. This resulted in an approximation of the rigidity dependence of the zeroth and first harmonic cosmic rays anisotropy coefficients, calculated for a ground-based cosmic ray detectors network. Analysis of the obtained results showed that the approximation was performed with high accuracy, and the results are suitable for use in latitude measurements during marine expeditions.",

These winds often manifest themselves in X-ray spectra as blueshifted, highly ionized absorption lines. Previous observations suggest that the mass loss rate from the disk due to disk winds can be comparable to or even more than the mass accretion rate onto the black hole, indicating that disk winds likely play crucial roles in shaping the accretion disk structure and affecting the surrounding environment. However, the mechanisms driving these winds, as well as how their structure changes in response to variations in the mass accretion rate, remain poorly understood. The X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM), launched in September 2023, is equipped with Resolve, a cutting-edge X-ray micro-calorimeter that delivers unprecedented spectral resolution. Resolve is expected to significantly advance our understanding of wind launching mechanisms and their impact on accretion processes and environments. In this article, we review the progress made in the pre-XRISM era, highlight key results obtained from XRISM observations to date, and outline future prospects.",

We consider a Fishbone--Moncrief torus orbiting a Kerr black hole with spin parameter $a = 0.9375$, threaded by large-scale magnetic fields that are asymmetric about the equatorial plane. The degree of equatorial asymmetry in the magnetic field is parametrized by an angle, with values of $30^\\circ$, $45^\\circ$, and $60^\\circ$. We examine how this equatorially asymmetric initial magnetic field configuration influences the magnetic field structure, accretion flow morphology, and angular momentum transport across a range of initial plasma beta values ($\\beta = 0.007, 0.005, 0.001$). We find that such deformation in the magnetic field leads to noticeable changes in the inner disk structure, asymmetric outflow patterns in the poloidal plane, and time-dependent variations in accretion rates. These effects are generally more pronounced at lower beta values, where magnetic pressure dominates; in particular, the $30^\\circ$ case at $\\beta = 0.001$ exhibits strong and persistent asymmetric inflows and outflows. Our results demonstrate that equatorially asymmetric magnetic field configurations can significantly influence the structure and variability of relativistic accretion flows. These findings motivate future extensions to full three-dimensional studies, where black hole magnetosphere can be explored in a more general setting.",

A recent study has proposed thousands of dormant black hole and neutron star binary candidates using summary statistics from Gaia DR3 by simulating and fitting Gaia observables. In this Letter, we perform broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting from the optical to the infrared for 1,328 candidates, incorporating GALEX ultraviolet photometry to assess the presence of hidden hot companions. We quantify ultraviolet excess by comparing observed near-ultraviolet fluxes with single-star SED predictions and further test whether excesses can be explained by non-degenerate stellar companions for sources exhibiting moderate excess. We additionally examine the Galactic kinematics of the sample to identify systems potentially affected by natal kicks during compact-object formation. By combining the ultraviolet and kinematic diagnostics, we identify 176 sources as the highest-priority candidates for follow-up observations, in which 19 are black hole candidates with previously provided masses $\\geq$ 3 $M_\\odot$.",

Accepted to Astronomy and Astrophysics 23rd January 2026 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Mass loss through stellar jets is closely tied to the process of accretion through the disk. Understanding phenomena such as episodic ejections and outflow asymmetries can thus shed light on the mechanism of jet launching and its connection to both mass accretion and the evolution of the protoplanetary disk. We use new VLT/MUSE Narrow Field Mode observations of the Classical T Tauri Star Th 28 to map the jet structures within 6'' of the source at an effective angular resolution of 0.''12, provided by the combination of the AO correction and image deconvolution. The emission line profiles and flux ratios are investigated and diagnostic analysis of the optical forbidden emission lines (FELs) is used to estimate the electron density, ionisation fraction, electron temperature and shock velocities in both jet lobes within 200 au of the star. The mass outflow rates in each lobe are obtained using the derived total densities and FEL luminosities and compared with the mass accretion rate. We identify several new knots in both jet lobes which have been ejected in the previous 10 years on a timescale of 3-6 years, which is significantly more frequent than previously estimated. In both lobes we find comparable mass outflow rates close to the jet base. Th 28 has undergone a significant rise in mass accretion rate between 2014 and 2023, which may be linked to the most recently ejected knot pair detected in each side of the jet. The red-shifted jet mass outflow rate shows a similar increase of a factor 2, indicating that the ratio of mass outflow to accretion remains constant. A moderately lower mass outflow rate is found in the faster blue-shifted lobe, supporting the possibility that momentum ejection is conserved on each side of the jet. The frequent knot ejections indicate that this source is a good target for further monitoring to study the accretion-ejection connection.",

The event was associated with an intense X-class solar flare and a strong solar energetic proton event. This paper reports the first ground-based detection of a GLE using gamma-ray detectors operating simultaneously in both polar regions, which are concurrent with increases in neutron monitor counts. Thus highlights the capability of polar gamma-ray detectors to complement traditional neutron monitor observations during extreme solar proton events. A detailed analysis revealed distinct prompt and delayed responses during the event evolution. Interestingly, the signature of the prompt peak of GLE#77 (at 10:38 UT) was observed up to high-rigidity neutron monitors (low latitudes). However, the delayed peak (at 13:08 UT) was not seen at the stations with rigidity > 6 GV. The timing of the prompt and delayed peaks coincided with the proton flux peaks observed by the GOES-18 satellite at energies > 150 MeV and 12-99 MeV, respectively. It is observed that the GLE amplitude has a strong dependence on geomagnetic cutoff rigidity and has a weak solar zenith angle dependence.",

The $\\gamma$-ray emission is widely believed to be produced by high-energy electrons and positrons accelerated by the pulsar wind nebulae when scattering off the interstellar radiation field via the inverse Compton process. Consequently, multiwavelength counterparts of the $\\gamma$-ray halos are expected to be present, which have not yet been detected. In this work we report the possible detection of extended X-ray emission from a $\\sim 0.2\\degr$ radius region around PSR B0656+14 with eROSITA. In spite that there are uncertainties of the on-orbit point spread function of the pointing mode, the radial profile of PSR B0656+14 is found to be broader than that of a star at similar observational conditions, indicating that emission is possibly from the expected extended halo around the pulsar. The spectrum of the emission can be described by a power-law function with an index of $\\sim3.7$. Its surface brightness declines with radius faster than the prediction of the particle diffusion and synchrotron radiation in a uniform magnetic field, suggesting the existence of a radial gradient of the magnetic field strength as $\\sim r^{-1}$.

While the associated electron and positron propagation is often modeled using homogeneous and isotropic diffusion, termed here as standard diffusion, the actual transport process is expected to be more complex. This work introduces the Pulsar Halo Emission Computation Tool (PHECT), a lightweight software designed for modeling pulsar halo emission. PHECT incorporates multiple transport models extending beyond standard diffusion, accounting for different possible origins of pulsar halos. Users can conduct necessary computations simply by configuring a YAML file without manual code edits. Furthermore, the tool adopts finite-volume discretizations that remain stable on non-uniform grids and in the presence of discontinuous diffusion coefficients.

Johnson, Taeho Ryu, Rosalba Perna High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph) We present hydrodynamic simulations with the moving-mesh code AREPO of Tidal Disruption Encores (TDEEs) in nuclear star clusters (NSCs). TDEEs arise when a stellar-mass black hole (sBH) disrupts a star within the NSC, producing debris that is unbound from the sBH but remains gravitationally bound to the central massive black hole (MBH), leading to a delayed secondary flare. We find that the morphology and thermodynamics of the fallback material depend sensitively on the disruption geometry, MBH mass, and sBH-MBH separation. We identify two distinct morphological outcomes: ring encores, where debris circularize into a torus, and direct encores, where streams plunge toward the MBH, with encore luminosities peaking at times corresponding to the freefall timescale and one orbital period, respectively. Across all simulated cases, we find these events exhibit luminosities of $10^{40}-10^{42}$ erg/s with lightcurves characteristic of their morphology. Our work greatly improves the predictions of TDEE lightcurves and empowers observations to probe into NSC dynamics and sBH population while providing possible explanations for anomalous TDE-like flares.",

Guided by analytic scalings and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we show that the pulsar ``Fundamental Plane'' (relating gamma-ray luminosity, spectral cutoff energy, spin-down power $\\dot{\\cal{E}}$, and surface magnetic field) is bounded by two regimes: a radiation-reaction-limited branch and a potential-drop-limited branch. Their intersection defines a transition in $\\dot{\\cal{E}}$ that maps to a gamma-ray visibility threshold on the $P-\\dot{P}$ diagram, above which detectability is set by distance and beaming, and below which both cutoff energy and efficiency decline rapidly. Placing ATNF pulsars and McGill magnetars onto these planes reproduces the observed Fermi occupancy, with millisecond pulsars (MSPs) on the observable side, young pulsars (YPs) straddling the threshold, and magnetars clustering at or just below it. At higher $\\dot{\\cal{E}}$, both MSPs and YPs depart from the maximal radiation-reaction-limited envelope at similar cutoff energies, suggesting that enhanced pair creation screens the accelerating electric field in the ECS. We interpret this behavior with a compactness-based criterion for optically thin $\\gamma\\gamma$ pair feedback in or near the ECS and briefly note an extension to $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow\\mu^\\pm$ that could yield pulsed multi-TeV neutrinos in the most energetic systems. The framework predicts a MeV-bright, GeV-faint corridor below Fermi sensitivity, a target for next-generation MeV missions. Finally, motivated by the recent HESSII detection of pulsed multi-TeV emission from Vela, we use PIC particle distributions with a seed-photon model to reproduce a multi-TeV inverse-Compton component alongside the GeV curvature emission, supporting a unified ECS-based GeV-TeV origin.",

Miller, Niranjan Chandra Roy Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The James Webb Space Telescope has unveiled an abundant population of potential active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshift ($z\\gtrsim4$) known as little red dots (LRDs), which are likely hosted in relatively low-mass galaxies. However, previous theoretical models have highlighted the difficulty in continuously feeding massive black holes in the central regions of bursty, high-redshift galaxies because of repeated gas evacuation by stellar feedback. We analyze galaxies in high-redshift FIRE-2 simulations to understand whether they are capable of hosting the observed abundant population of high-redshift AGN. We use a gravitational torque-driven accretion (GTDA) model and a simple free-fall accretion model to derive black hole accretion rates and construct predicted AGN bolometric luminosity functions for $z=5-7$. The GTDA model and the free-fall model with black holes accreting $\\lesssim 1$ percent of their central gas supply ($<100 \\rm \\ pc$) per free-fall time predict AGN abundances that are more than sufficient to explain the most recent LRD observations. The fiducial models, in fact, overpredict the number of low-luminosity AGN as compared with observations. We explore possible resolutions of this tension. A plausible, though likely not unique, scenario for alleviating the AGN overpredictions and which also provides a good match to the host-galaxy UV luminosity distribution suggests that LRDs are super Eddington-accreting, Eddington luminosity-limited, $M_{\\rm BH}\\gtrsim 2\\times10^5 \\ \\rm M_\\odot$ black holes residing in $M_\\star \\gtrsim 2\\times10^7 \\ \\rm M_\\odot$ galaxies.",

Submitted to A&A, comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The population of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) newly discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) exhibits peculiar properties that distinguish it from both local type I AGN and high-redshift quasars. Most of these sources are compact, appearing as 'little dots': among them, the sub-class (10-30% of the total) characterized by significantly red optical colors has been named 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs), while here we analogously introduce the term 'Little Blue Dots' (LBDs) for the remaining, bluer sources (70-90%). We then present a comparative analysis of the prototypical representatives ('Rosetta Stones') of the two classes: GN-28074 at z=2.26, the Red Rosetta Stone, and GS-3073 at z=5.55, the Blue Rosetta Stone. In both Rosetta Stones the broad Balmer lines are better described by exponential profiles rather than single Gaussians, similarly to normal low-redshift type I AGN, indicating that exponential profiles are not unique to LRDs. They are both extremely X-ray weak, show strong auroral [OIII] 4363 emission, weak hot dust mid-IR emission, and no time variability. However, they differ in terms of excitation diagnostics: the HeII 4686 line is undetected in the Red Rosetta but strongly detected in the Blue Rosetta in both narrow and broad components, with the latter much broader than hydrogen Balmer lines. This supports BLR stratification and disfavors the cocoon electron-scattering scenario. An additional difference is the presence of prominent Balmer absorption in the Red Rosetta -- indicative of extremely dense gas along the line of sight -- but absent in the Blue Rosetta. Taken together, these results suggest that LRDs and LBDs share the same central engine as standard type I AGN, while differing in the amount and geometry of dense gas surrounding the accretion disk, and/or in their accretion properties.",

See Figures 3 and 4 for main results and Figure 5 for interpretation Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The orientation of radio jets relative to their host galaxies offers an interesting avenue for probing the connection between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their surroundings. Several studies have also investigated the orientation of nuclear dust features. We follow up on this previous work with newer Hubble Space Telescope imaging of early-type radio galaxies, and a largely automated process for measuring position angles. We classify the dust features as lanes, disks, or rings. Lanes are irregular structures that likely form from gas-rich minor mergers, while disks and rings are more well-defined and may form from settling lanes or internal mechanisms. We find that dust lanes do not have a preferred alignment relative to their host galaxies, but are preferentially perpendicular to the jets. In contrast, dust disks and rings tend to be closely aligned with the major axes of their host galaxies, but have varying orientations relative to the jets. Our results suggest that infalling dusty material from mergers can influence the angle of the radio jet. This would allow the jet orientation to change over time, and may help explain the role of AGN feedback in maintaining quiescence in massive galaxies.",

Ho, Amelie Saintonge, Zheng Zheng, Nathan Deg, Ningyu Tang, Xin Ai, Junzhi Wang, Xiang Jie, Di Li Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Polar ring galaxies (PRGs) host an outer ring of gas and stars oriented nearly perpendicular to the main stellar body. They represent extreme examples of misaligned systems and provide valuable insight into galaxy interactions, gas accretion, and peculiar gas dynamics. We compile a complete sample of kinematically confirmed PRGs and collect their H I measurements. Combining literature data with new observations from FAST, we detect H I emission in 22 sources, identify one potential H I absorption feature, and find four non-detections among 40 confirmed PRGs. Compared to galaxies in the ALFALFA and xGASS surveys, PRGs predominantly occupy the green valley or quenched regimes but exhibit higher gas fractions than typical early-type galaxies, suggesting gas accretion. The H I profile asymmetry and shape for PRGs are not consistent with that of the ALFALFA sample with p<0.05. We examine their Tully-Fisher relation (TFR) and baryonic TFR (bTFR), linking the systems' rotation velocities to their masses. The extreme outliers in TFRs for the control sample tend to display single-peaked H I profiles. PRGs do not follow a tight TFR or bTFR if the H I resides primarily in the host galaxy. But the scatter decreases significantly if we assume the gas is mainly distributed in the polar ring. Spatially resolved H I observations are essential to disentangle the gas distribution and kinematics in PRGs, which are key to understanding their formation mechanisms.",

Zanchettin Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present VLT/ERIS IFU J-band observations of MCG-03-34-64, a nearby (z = 0.0167) Seyfert galaxy hosting a candidate dual AGN system with a separation of ~100 pc between the nuclei. The observations cover, among others, the HeI1.083um, [FeII]1.257um and Pa$\\beta$ emission lines, over a FoV of 3\"x3\"(~1x1 kpc$^2$). We analyse the ionised gas kinematics and identify two regions with enhanced velocity dispersion (W80~1500 km/s), suggestive of fast outflowing gas, spatially coincident with the position of the two candidate active nuclei. The spectra of the two outflows show a prominent blueshifted wing with velocities vmax ~ -1700 km/s corresponding to the highest 2-5 percentiles of samples of local AGN with similar bolometric luminosities. For the ionised phase of the two outflows, we derive comparable masses of $(4\\pm1)\\times 10^5$ $M_{\\odot}$ and mass outflow rates of $20\\pm5$ $M_{\\odot}$/yr. The two distinct outflows could be associated with the two nuclei, or be generated by the interaction of the radio jet with the ISM. We also analyse the peculiar profile of the [Fe VII]6087A optical coronal line from an archival VLT/X-shooter spectrum. The comparison with the [NeV]3425A and [FeII]1.257um profiles indicates that [Fe VII] emission likely arises only from the outflow. The absence of the systemic component in [Fe VII] - unlike in [NeV], which has similar ionisation potential and critical density - suggests suppression of [Fe VII] due to iron depletion onto dust grains, while its detection in the outflow implies a lower dust content than in the host ISM. The additional information gained from the ERIS data are consistent with the scenario of a dual AGN, however further observations are required to confirm its nature.",

Accepted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present revised stellar ages for 23 pre-main sequence K- and M-type stars in the Upper Scorpius star-forming region, derived by using stellar dynamical masses to constrain isochronal ages from five pre-main sequence stellar evolutionary models. We find that mass-constrained stellar ages for all model sets are more consistent with the older, ~8-11 Myr age for Upper Sco derived using earlier-type stars. Additionally, applying the independent mass constraint to isochronal ages tends to 1) increase stellar ages for most model sets, and 2) decrease age scatter for individual sources between model sets. Models that account for global magnetic fields consistently produce the best match to our observations: they change comparatively little when the mass constraint is applied, and produce 9-10 Myr ages under both unconstrained and mass-constrained conditions. Most standard (nonmagnetic) models produce younger ages (3-5 Myr) when unconstrained, but older ages (6-9 Myr) when constrained by dynamical mass. Our results are consistent with literature findings that suggest median disk lifetimes may be >2x longer than previously thought.",

Submitted to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We map the extraplanar gas, with $\\sim$50-200 pc resolution, in nine star-forming galaxies using Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations from the GECKOS VLT Large Program targeting edge-on galaxies with similar stellar mass as the Milky Way. The narrow range in stellar mass ($\\pm0.35$ dex) of the GECKOS sample makes it ideal for studying trends with star formation rate (SFR). We find strong extraplanar emission reaching $\\sim$2-8 kpc from the disk midplane in all targets with $\\rm{SFR}\\geq$1 M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Targets with SFR$\\,\\geq\\,$5 M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ have brighter, more extended H$\\alpha$ emission compared to lower SFR targets. In high-SFR systems, the gas velocity dispersion ($\\sigma_{\\rm H\\alpha}$) shows a biconical morphology, consistent with the expectation of outflows. This agrees with previous works suggesting high velocity dispersion in a biconical shape is a good means to identify outflows. We find mixed results using line diagnostics ([OIII]$_{5007}$/H$\\beta$ - [NII]/H$\\alpha$ and $\\sigma_{\\rm H\\alpha}$ - [SII]/H$\\alpha$) to spatially resolve ionisation mechanisms across the extraplanar gas. The highest [NII]/H$\\alpha$ are the extraplanar gas of the highest SFR systems, yet main-sequence galaxies have the highest [OIII]/H$\\beta$. While the morphology of [NII]/H$\\alpha$ may be useful to identify outflows, the absolute value of the line ratio alone may not distinguish strong outflows from extraplanar gas of main-sequence galaxies. The ubiquitous extraplanar emission can be interpreted as the result of feedback, in the form of large-scale winds for starbursts or smaller-scale galactic fountains for main-sequence galaxies. Moreover, shock-heating may ionise gas at the interface of the disk and the circumgalactic medium, independent of the source of the gas.",

Zapata, Dongting Yang, Yaping Peng, Chao Zhang, Fengwei Xu, Y. H. Chen, Shujie Li, Meng Ruan Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) To deepen our understanding of star-forming properties, we studied a massive protocluster IRAS 15596-5301 using ALMA 870 um and 3 mm data. High-resolution 870 um data reveal 34 dense cores, including 3 hot molecular cores, with subsequent line surveys detecting 22 molecular species toward them. Two velocity components (I15596-red/I15596-blue) were found in the averaged H13CO+(1-0) spectrum, and two filaments were identified from velocity-resolved integrated intensity maps. A spatial overlap between the two filaments was observed, and this overlapping region exhibits a distinct bridge-shaped feature in the position-velocity diagram constructed along the entire filamentary structures. Combined with the reduced H13CO+/HCO+ ratio in the overlapping region and the three-dimensional position-position-velocity cube data, we conclude that a non-head-on collision occurs between the edges of the two filamentary structures in IRAS 15596-5301. Cluster analysis demonstrates that clusters located in the collision region host more evolved chemical rich dense cores than their counterparts in other regions. Our results thus indicate that star formation in I15596 is triggered or accelerated by a mild non-head-on collision between two filaments.",

Thanks to the LAMOST MRS-N dataset's large sky coverage and high spatial/spectral resolution, we examined this relationship using 10 isolated Galactic HII regions with R < 20 pc. Our results reveal two key findings: (1) these small-size HII regions remarkably follow the same size-$\\sigma$ relation as giant HII regions, suggesting this correlation could serve as a novel distance indicator for Galactic HII regions; and (2) we find distinct dynamical behaviors between younger and older HII regions. Specifically, in younger (< 0.5 Myr), ionization-bounded HII regions, the velocity dispersion shows no correlation with expansion velocity, indicating that turbulence is driven primarily by stellar winds and ionization processes. In contrast, in older (> 0.5 Myr), matter-bounded HII regions, a clear correlation emerges, implying that expansion-driven processes begin to play a significant role in generating turbulence. We therefore propose an evolutionary transition in the primary turbulence mechanisms, from being dominated by stellar winds and radiation to being increasingly influenced by expansion-driven dynamics, during the evolution of HII regions. Considering the small sample size used in this work, particularly the inclusion of only two young HII regions, which also have large uncertainties in their expansion velocities, further confirmation of this interpretation will require higher-resolution 2D spectroscopy to resolve blended kinematic components along the line of sight for more accurate estimation of expansion velocities, along with an expanded sample that specifically includes more young HII regions.",

Jadhav Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Context: The dynamical evolution of binary populations in embedded star clusters shapes the statistical properties of binaries observed in the Galactic field. Accurately modelling this process requires resolving both early cluster dynamics and binary interactions. Aims: We aim to characterize the early dynamical evolution of primordial binaries in embedded clusters and identify the key parameters that govern binary survival and disruption. Methods: We perform a set of direct $N$-body simulations starting from 100\\% primordial binaries in a time-varying gas potential of a gas-embedded cluster. To describe the evolution of binary orbital properties, we define empirical dynamical operators for period, binding energy, and mass ratio, and calibrate them across the simulated ensemble. Results:The binding energy and orbital period evolve in a consistent, sigmoidal fashion. Their dynamical operators reveal that hard binaries heat the cluster and suppress wide binary formation, while a small residual population of soft binaries survives. The evolution of the mass-ratio distribution is less directly linked to dynamical processing and more shaped by internal processes such as stellar physics process in the pre-main-sequence phase. High-$q$ systems tend to be enhanced, while low-$q$ systems are prone to disruption. Conclusions: The binary evolution in clusters is primarily governed by binding energy and orbital period. Our model improves over previous parameterizations of the dynamical operator by allowing for the existence of wide binaries and incorporating the embedded cluster phase. For individual clusters, direct $N$-body modelling remains the only reliable approach. On Galactic scales, population synthesis methods based on the stellar dynamical operator approach developed here remain essential.",

Rotational transitions of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN in their $v_8 = 1$ lowest excited vibrational states ($E_{\\rm vib} \\approx 520$ K) are quite prominent in Sagittarius B2(N). In order to be able to search for transitions of the next higher vibrational state $v_8 = 2$, we recorded spectra of samples enriched in $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN up to $v_8 = 2$ in the 35 to 1091~GHz region and reinvestigated existing spectra of CH$_3$CN in its natural isotopic composition between 1085 and 1200 GHz. Perturbations caused by near-degeneracies in $K = 4$ of $v_8 = 2^0$ and $K = 2$ of $v_8 = 2^{-2}$ yielded accurate information on the energy spacing of 22.93 and 21.79 cm$^{-1}$ between the $l$-components of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN, respectively. Fermi-type interaction between $K = 13$ and 14 of $v_8 = 1^{-1}$ and $v_8 = 2^{+2}$ probe the energy differences between the two states of both isotopomers. In addition, a $\\Delta K \\pm2$, $\\Delta l \\mp1$ interaction between the ground vibrational state of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and $v_8 = 1^{+1}$ provides information on their energy spacing. Furthermore, we obtained improved or extended ground state rotational transition frequencies of $^{13}$CH$_3$$^{13}$CN and extensive data for $^{13}$CH$_3$C$^{15}$N and CH$_3$$^{13}$C$^{15}$N.

Submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) A major challenge in identifying massive quiescent galaxies at $z>3$ is distinguishing truly passive systems from dust-obscured star-forming galaxies, as both populations exhibit similar red ultraviolet (UV)-to-near-infrared (NIR) colors. In this work, we present ALMA Band 7 dust-continuum observations of five ultramassive galaxies (UMGs; $\\log (M_\\star / M_\\odot) > 11$) spectroscopically confirmed at $z_{\\rm spec} > 3$ from the MAGAZ3NE survey. Our results reveal that only one galaxy shows a faint 870 \\um\\ dust continuum detection, while the remaining four UMGs are undetected down to the $3\\sigma$ depth . By incorporating ALMA constraints into the spectral energy distribution analysis, we confirm that these UV-NIR-selected systems are truly quiescent UMGs, lying more than one dex below the star-forming main sequence with $\\mathrm{\\log (sSFR/Gyr^{-1}) < -1}$, thereby ruling out the possibility of obscured star formation. We then estimate dust masses using both spectral energy distribution modeling and modified blackbody fitting, with consistent results between the two methods. We find that three UMGs have evolved into extremely dust-poor quiescent galaxies, with $M_{\\mathrm{dust}}/M_\\star \\lesssim 10^{-4}$, while the ALMA-detected galaxy has a comparatively higher dust reservoir with $M_{\\mathrm{dust}}/M_\\star \\sim 10^{-3}$. Our results present the most massive and extremely dust-poor spectroscopically confirmed quiescent galaxies known at $3 < z < 4$, providing valuable observational constraints on rapid dust removal and quenching processes in the early universe. Future molecular line observations will be essential to directly measure the gas content and verify the efficiency of the depletion process.",

Their formation from smaller hydrocarbons is not well understood, in part because abundances of many species are not known. Methylallene, CH$_3$CHCCH$_2$, may be one of the building blocks, but its rotational spectrum was characterized only to a very limited extent. We recorded rotational transitions in the 36$-$501 GHz region to extend the existing line list of methylallene and thus enable searches for the molecule in space. Quantum-chemical calculations were carried out to evaluate initial spectroscopic parameters. We obtained transition frequencies with $J \\le 61$ and $K_a \\le 21$ and resolved the internal rotation splitting of the CH$_3$ group at least partially. As a result, a full set of distortion parameters up to sixth order along with two octic ones were determined, as well as parameters describing the internal rotation of the methyl group. The spectroscopic parameters are accurate enough to identify methylallene up to 720 GHz, sufficient for searches even in the warm interstellar medium.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present long-slit near-infrared spectroscopic observations of six nearby (z$\\sim$0.1) radio-quiet type-2 quasars (QSO2s) from the Quasar Feedback (QSOFEED) sample. They have bolometric luminosities of $10^{45-46}~erg~s^{-1}$ and stellar masses of $ 10^{10.6-11.3}~M_{\\odot}$. The observations were obtained with the instrument Espectrógrafo Multiobjeto Infra-Rojo (EMIR) on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias. The nuclear K-band spectra (central $\\sim$1-3 kpc of the QSO2s) reveal signatures of high-velocity outflows in either the Pa$\\alpha$ or Br$\\gamma$ lines, depending on the redshift, and in the [Si VI] lines. The broadest kinematic components have full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $\\sim$1200-2500 km $s^{-1}$. From the near-infrared hydrogen recombination lines we derived ionized outflow masses of $M_{Hion} \\sim0.08-20\\times 10^{6}~M_{\\odot}$, mass outflow rates of $\\dot{M}_{Hion}\\sim0.03-6~M_{\\odot}~yr^{-1}$, and kinetic powers of $\\dot{E}_{Hion}\\sim 10^{37.8-40.8}~erg~s^{-1}$. These ionized gas outflow masses and mass outflow rates have median values that are 5.9 and 5.8 times larger, respectively, than those derived from the [Si VI] line. Our study provides evidence, at least for these six QSO2s, that the near-infrared recombination lines and [Si VI] are tracing the same outflow (i.e., they have similar kinematics and radii), but they carry different amounts of mass. We detected warm molecular lines in the six QSO2s, from which we measured total (nuclear) gas masses from 1.1 (0.7) to 32 (13) $\\times~10^3~M_{\\odot}$, similar to other QSO2s with warm $H_2$ measurements reported in the literature, but we did not find any molecular outflow associated with them. Comparing with other five QSO2s with $H_2$ measurements reported in the literature, we find that the four QSO2s with detected $H_2$ outflows have total (nuclear) $H_2$ masses 2.2 (2.7) times larger, on average.",

Using the IRAM 30-m telescope at lambda = 1.4 and 3 mm, we probed the molecular gas distribution at angular resolutions of ~12\"-28\" (0.1-0.3 pc at d = 2.1 kpc). The velocity-resolved C18O(1-0) observations conclusively show a main filament with a skeleton of ridges. The main filament is a 5 pc long velocity-coherent structure with a continuous and quiescent velocity field along its length up to the star-forming hub that accretes mass from the filament. The internal gas kinematics of most of the G183 filament is dominated by thermal motions (sigma_NT/cs~1) and large-scale velocity gradients arising due to outflows and accretion of matter in the massive YSO. The dispersion-size relation almost up to 1 pc is consistent with Larson's law, suggesting that the origin of the filament is a turbulence cascade. The massive YSO, S1, with no corresponding radio continuum detection is characterized as a high-mass protostellar object with a mass of 156 Msun and an M/L ratio of 0.04. We identify a kinematic signature of the accretion of material from the filament onto the YSO, S1. The rates of molecular gas accretion and entrainment in S1 are estimated to be 8.6 and 2.6 (in units of 10^-4 Msun/yr), respectively. In comparison to the inner Galaxy high-mass star-forming filaments forming massive stars, G183 has a lower column density; however, the accretion and outflow rates in S1 are similar. The detection of hydrocarbons such as CH3CN and HC3N indicates the presence of hot-core chemistry in S1. These results highlight the universality of physical processes involved in massive star formation across a range of Galactic environments.",

We construct 38,334 cutouts of well-resolved galaxies in the g, r, i bands, applying a novel \"tiered sigmoid scaling function\" to dynamically adjust image contrast according to the object's signal-to-noise and background level. A supplemental labeled sample of 366 galaxies enables qualitative assessment of the learned embeddings. We train a convolutional neural network with image augmentations including injection of simulated background stars, and project the resulting 512-dimensional representations into two dimensions using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and its local density preserving variant (densMAP). We find that the NNCLR latent space recovers global trends corresponding to major merger features, yet does not reliably separate stellar streams without further supervision. To interpret the network's implicit attention, we compute gradient-based saliency maps averaged over the full dataset: these reveal that the tiered sigmoid scaling effectively attenuates information from the center of the image cutouts, thereby suppressing the learning of high surface brightness features of each image cutout's central galaxy. Our study provides a blueprint for leveraging contrastive methods to mine forthcoming survey data for faint tidal substructure, and highlights key preprocessing and interpretability considerations for robust stream detection.",

We investigate the consistency of these observations within a data-driven framework that links the galaxy stellar mass function to the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass function and AGN luminosity functions using different $M_{\\rm BH}-M_{*}$ relations and the observed Eddington-ratio distribution. By comparing our predictions against observed AGN luminosity functions at $z\\sim 5.5$ we find that observations can be reproduced either by highly-elevated $M_{\\rm BH}-M_{*}$ relations paired with low duty cycles, or moderate relations with higher duty cycles. Through the Soltan argument, we find that $M_{\\rm BH}-M_{*}$ relations that are modestly above the local relation for AGN produce consistency between multiple tracers of the SMBH demography at $z\\sim 5.5$, while more extreme normalisations would require a weakly-evolving luminosity function at $z> 5.5$. Continuity-equation modelling shows that initially high $M_{\\rm BH}-M_{*}$ relations predict a strong two-phase evolutionary scenario and very steep low-mass SMBH mass functions in tension with several current estimates, while more moderate relations generate local SMBH mass functions in better agreement with present determinations and near-constant scaling relations. Our results favour a scenario where SMBHs at $z \\sim 5$ on average lie modestly above local AGN scaling relations, with elevated but physically plausible duty cycles. Future wide-field clustering and demographic studies will help break the remaining degeneracies between SMBH scaling relations and AGN duty cycles at early cosmic times.",

Studies have explored the dynamical evolution of SMBH pairs under the influence of dynamical friction to calculate pairing times and predict the expected population of dual-AGNs at various redshifts. We formulate a three-dimensional dynamical model of SMBH pairs in the innermost kiloparsec of a post-merger galaxy to investigate the impact of orbital inclination with respect to the galactic disk on pairing times. The SMBH pairs are evolved in 81 different galaxy configurations initialized using a Gauss-Seidel Poisson solver. The dynamics are calculated for 12 distinct initial inclinations ranging from 0 to 75 degrees in each of the galaxies to gauge the impact of inclination on pairing time. Orbits characterized by initial inclinations greater than 20 degrees frequently require longer pairing times when compared to uninclined orbits. Pairing times for orbits with inclinations $\\gtrsim 45$ degrees often exceed 14 Gyr. Galaxies with higher mass SMBH pairs and faster rotating disks generally shorten pairing times relative to galaxies with less massive or slower rotating disks when the inclination is $\\lesssim 45$ degrees. The model suggests that SMBH pairs that form from mergers at inclinations $\\lesssim 20$ degrees are likely progenitors of dual-AGN and gravitational wave sources.",

We show that this http URL DMO can reproduce core slopes consistent with observations of isolated dwarf galaxies and more massive ($\\text{M}_{vir} \\gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$) CDM dwarf halos that include stellar feedback from the matched CDM run (Storm CDM+baryons). We identify nine this http URL SIDM DMO halos in the core-collapse phase of gravothermal evolution with halo masses below $2\\times 10^9 M_{\\odot}$. We find that using core slope to measure the core-collapse timescales of this http URL DMO halos agrees well with predicted collapse times estimated with the parametric model for SIDM halos introduced by \\cite{Yang2023}. Additionally, compared to central density, core slope is less sensitive to both the radius of measurement and halo merger history. These results indicate that the slope of the inner DM density profile more cleanly differentiates core-collapsed versus core-forming halos than central density amplitude.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We investigate the evolution of the PAH population's charge state and size across key physical zones in the Orion Bar, which include the HII region, the atomic PDR (APDR), and three HI/H2 dissociation fronts (DF1, DF2, and DF3). Utilising the NASA Ames PAH Infrared Spectroscopic Database (PAHdb) and the pyPAHdb spectral modelling tool, we analysed the MIRI-MRS observations of the Orion Bar from the \"PDRs4All\" ERS Program. pyPAHdb modelling reveals the fractional contribution of the different PAH charge states and sizes to the total PAH emission across the Orion Bar. Cationic PAH emission peaks in the APDR region, where neutral PAHs have minimal contribution. Emission from neutral PAHs peaks in the HII region that consists of emission from a face-on PDR associated to the background OMC-1 molecular cloud, and in the molecular cloud regions past DF2. PAH anions are observed deep within the DF2 and DF3 zones. The average PAH size ranges between ~$60-74$ Nc. The modelling reveals regions of top-down PAH formation at the ionisation front, and bottom-up PAH formation within the molecular cloud region. The PAH ionisation parameter $\\gamma$ ranges between ~$2-9 x 10^4$. Intensity ratios tracing PAH ionisation scale well with $\\gamma$ in regions encompassing edge-on or face-on PDR emission, but their correlation weakens within the molecular cloud zone. Modelling of the $5-15$ $\\mu$m PAH spectrum with pyPAHdb achieves comprehensive characterization of the net contribution of neutral and cationic PAHs across different environments, whereas empirical PAH proxy intensity ratio tracers can be highly variable and unreliable outside regions dominated by PDR emission. The derived average PAH size in the different physical zones is consistent with a view of PAHs being more extensively subjected to ultraviolet processing closer to the ionisation front, and less affected within the molecular cloud.",

Parker, Megan Allen (University of Sheffield, UK) 11 pages, 6 figures, published in MNRAS as 'On the occurrence of $λ$ Boötis stars in star clusters' Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) $\\lambda$ Boötis stars are a subset of chemically peculiar A-stars that display Solar abundances in lighter elements (C, N, O, S, etc.) but a deficiency in Iron-peak elements. This difference has been attributed to the A-stars accreting pristine (metal deficient) gas from the Interstellar Medium. However, the recent discovery of $\\lambda$ Boötis stars in clusters challenges this theory, due to the presence of ionising radiation from intermediate/massive ($>$5 M$_\\odot$) stars, which could prevent accretion of pristine ISM gas. We use $N$-body simulations to track the dynamical histories of A-stars during the evolution of a star cluster. We find that some stars leave the confines of the cluster and travel beyond the tidal radius, where they may be able to accrete pristine ISM gas. These A-stars then sometimes move back into the inner regions of the cluster, but the photoionising radiation flux they receive is not high enough to prevent $\\lambda$ Boötis abundances from occurring in these A-stars. We find that A-stars can develop $\\lambda$ Boötis abundances and subsequently form a wide ($>100$ au) binary system, meaning that observations of binary systems that have different abundances between the component stars would not rule out the ISM accretion scenario. Whilst we have shown that $\\lambda$ Boötis stars can reside in and around star clusters, further research is required to assess the validity of the accretion rates required to explain their abundance patterns.",

Accepted in ApJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The material in planet-forming disks determines the composition of planets; hence, it is crucial to understand the physical and chemical processes that set the abundance and distribution of key volatiles. James Webb Space Telescope observations of disks around very-low-mass ($\\sim0.1~M\\odot$) stars (VLMS) have revealed their hydrocarbon-rich inner regions (e.g., $\\mathrm{C_2H_2}$), with column densities significantly higher than predicted. We employ chemical kinetics models using the physical structure of the inner disk around an M~Dwarf star with an X-ray luminosity of $L_X\\sim10^{29}~\\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$. We adopt initial abundances that mimic the effects of carbon enhancement and oxygen depletion (C/O from 0.44 to 87.47) and quantify how the abundances and distributions of key volatiles respond. The column density and number of molecules ($\\mathcal{N}$) of hydrocarbons and oxygen-bearing species are highly sensitive to the C/O ratio, with the largest increases in hydrocarbons occurring when carbon increases by a factor of 2, and/or oxygen decreases by a factor of 10, relative to solar. In the IR-emitting region ($T_\\mathrm{gas}>200$~K), a range of C/O ratios can reproduce the observed $\\mathcal{N}$ and ratios relative to $\\mathrm{CO_2}$. The disk-integrated molecular ratio with respect to $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ is highly sensitive to the underlying C/O ratio. However, our results apply only to a source with a single X-ray luminosity value at the middle of that observed for VLMS; hence, a degeneracy between the stellar $L_X$ and the C/O ratio cannot be discarded. Nonetheless, our findings support that an enhanced C/O is required to drive the hydrocarbon-rich chemistry observed in the inner disks around VLMS.",

Rey, Corentin Cadiou, Taysun Kimm, Oscar Agertz 24 pages, 16 Figures, Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We introduce MEGATRON, a new galaxy formation model for cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations of high-redshift galaxies. The model accounts for the non-equilibrium chemistry and heating/cooling processes of $\\geq 80$ atoms, ions, and molecules, coupled to on-the-fly radiation transfer. We apply the model in a cosmological setting to the formation of a $10^9\\ {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ halo at $z=6$, and run 25 realizations at pc-scale resolution, varying numerous parameters associated with our state-of-the-art star formation, stellar feedback, and chemical enrichment models. We show that the overall budget of feedback energy is the key parameter that controls star formation regulation at high redshift, with other numerical parameters (e.g. supernova clustering, star formation conditions) having a more limited impact. As a similar feedback model has been shown to produce realistic $z=0$ galaxies, our work demonstrates that calibration at $z=0$ does not guarantee strong regulation of star formation at high-redshift. Interestingly, we find that subgrid model variations that have little impact on the final $z=6$ stellar mass can lead to substantial changes on the observable properties of high-redshift galaxies. For example, different star formation models based on, e.g. density thresholds or turbulence inspired criteria, lead to fundamentally distinct nebular emission line ratios across the interstellar medium (ISM). These results highlight the ISM as an important resource for constraining models of star formation, feedback, and galaxy formation in the JWST era, where emission line measurements for $>1,000$ high-redshift galaxies are now available.",

Naidu, Minghao Yue 20 pages, 8 Figures, Accepted for Publication in ApJ January 26, 2025 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate the association between galaxies and neutral OI absorption systems at z~6, which trace metal-enriched gas during the epoch of reionization. We identify 40 galaxies across six quasar fields, residing in 15 overdensities within 300 kpc of the background sightlines. Five OI absorption systems are associated with five of these overdensities, yielding a covering fraction of $0.27^{+0.13}_{-0.10}$ within 300 kpc. The absorption occurs beyond typical virial radii, indicating that the gas traces extended overdensity environments rather than individual galaxy halos, unlike the z~0 CGM which is largely bound to halos. These galaxy-associated absorbers account for $\\sim35\\%$ of all OI systems seen in blind quasar surveys, implying the remainder arise in lower-mass galaxies below our detection threshold or in dense neutral IGM pockets. The CGM around these galaxies contains $\\gtrsim 2\\times10^6~M_{\\odot}$ of oxygen, comparable to the ISM oxygen mass of the galaxies themselves, suggesting that the surrounding environment holds as much metal mass as the galaxies. All five galaxy-associated systems show significantly higher $\\log(N_{\\rm CII}/N_{\\rm OI})$ ratios than absorbers lacking galaxy associations. Furthermore, relative abundance ratios ([Si/O], [C/O]) reveal that four of the five exhibit enrichment patterns consistent with Population III nucleosynthesis at the outskirts of galaxy overdensities.. These rare systems offer a unique window into the role of first-generation stars in shaping the early metal enrichment of galaxies and their environments.",

Gas line-of-sight (LoS) velocity maps show a gradient of $60-100$ km s$^{-1}$, generally interpreted as a rotating gas disk consistent with the Tully-Fisher relation. Yet, the stars don't show rotation. Despite a small on-sky extent ($\\sim4$ kpc), the SMC exhibits a large ($\\sim10$ kpc) LoS depth, and the stellar photometric center is offset from the HI kinematic center by $\\sim$1 kpc. With N-body hydrodynamical simulations, we show that a recent ($\\sim$100 Myr ago) SMC-LMC collision (impact parameter $\\sim2$ kpc) explains the observed SMC's internal structure and kinematics. The simulated SMC is initialized with rotating stellar and gaseous disks. Post-collision, the SMC's tidal tail accounts for the large LoS depth. The SMC's stellar kinematics become dispersion dominated ($v/\\sigma\\approx0.2$), with radially outward motions at $R>2$ kpc, and a small ($<10$ km s$^{-1}$) remnant rotation at $R<2$ kpc, consistent with observations. Post-collision gas kinematics are also dominated by radially outward motions, without remnant rotation. Hence, the observed SMC's gas LoS velocity gradient is due to radial motions as opposed to disk rotation. Ram pressure from the LMC's gas disk during the collision imparts $\\approx30$ km s$^{-1}$ kick to the SMC's gas, sufficient to destroy gas rotation and offset the SMC's stellar and gas centers. Our work highlights the critical role of group processing through galaxy collisions in driving dIrr to dE/dSph transformation, including the removal of gas. Consequently, frameworks that treat the SMC as a galaxy in transformation are required to effectively use its observational data to constrain interstellar medium and dark matter physics.",

We use HI4PI data to investigate the kinematics and physical properties of high-velocity clouds (HVCs) toward the GC. Our results reveal that the HVCs exhibit a distinct asymmetric distribution, closely associated with the bar-driven tilted dust lanes and the distorted overshooting streams. We propose that powerful nuclear outflows interact with these gas-rich, off-plane structures, striping and entraining cold gas from the outer Galactic regions (R_GC~0.5--1.7 kpc) rather than solely from the region of the central molecular zone (CMZ; R_GC<0.3 kpc). In this scenario, as the Galactic bar drives gas inflows along the dust lanes, nuclear outflows simultaneously break through the CMZ, sweeping up and ablating cold gas from the boundary layer of these pre-existing structures. This process naturally accounts for the observed high turbulence, complex spectral signatures, and anomalous spatial-kinematic gas patterns, as well as multiwavelength asymmetries of the bubbles. The HVCs are accelerated to about 230--340 km/s over a dynamical time of ~3--6 Myr. When the multiphase, inhomogeneous composition of the gas is included, the estimated gas outflow rate reaches ~1 Msun/yr. This value is comparable to the bar-driven inflow rate, indicating a tightly coupled gas cycle in the inner Galaxy. Our research highlights the critical role of bar-driven gas dynamics and nuclear feedback in the secular evolution of the Milky Way, offering a valuable paradigm for investigating gas cycles in external galaxies.",

Cernicharo Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We report the detection of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) 1H-cyclopent[cd]indene (c-C11H8) in TMC-1 with the QUI- JOTE line survey. We detected 22 independent lines corresponding to 88 rotational transitions with quantum numbers ranging from J=19 up to J=24 and Ka <= 5 in the Q-band range. The identification of this new PAH was based on the agreement between the rotational parameters derived from the analysis of the lines and those obtained by quantum chemical calculations. The column density derived for 1H-cyclopent[cd]indene is (6.0 +- 0.5) x 10^12 cm-2, with a rotational temperature of 9 K. Its abundance is high, as is that of the rest of the PAHs, but it is the lowest of all those detected to date in TMC-1, being 2.66 times less abundant than indene and 4.66 times less than phenalene. This result will help us to better understand the growth of five- and six-membered rings in dark clouds. Chemical models explaining their formation through the bottom-up model are still very incomplete and require further experimental and theoretical effort. Even so, the most likely formation reactions would occur between the smallest rings with small hydrocarbons; the most probable reaction for the formation of cyclopentindene is that between indene and C2H, C2H3, and/or their cation.",

The aim is to build understanding of this pivotal class of stellar objects that provides the energy and processed material driving galactic evolution and setting the stage for subsequent star and planet formation. This collection of papers offers a unique discussion of physical factors that are driven by rapid rotation and whose influence directly impact the evolution and end-of-life state of massive stars. They are presented together to give the reader a perspective that only the ensemble can provide instead of a single paper. We hope that we are successful in our goal of shedding light on the scope and outcome of this important facet of massive star physics.",

Our findings are in general agreement with earlier studies that suggest magnetic deflection angles > 90 degrees are very unlikely to occur in sub-Alfvenic regimes. We find that their upper limit exhibits an identifiable trend with the Alfven Mach number Ma, suggesting that gradual steepening of Alfvenic deflections with increasing Ma is a plausible mechanism controlling deflection angles in the young solar wind. Further analysis reveals that large velocity fluctuations tend to be important in the largest sub-Alfvenic magnetic deflections with increasing contributions from the parallel component very close to Ma = 1, while virtually no magnetic deflections in the super-Alfvenic regime exhibit such large velocity perturbations. We also determine the local ratio of radial Poynting flux SR to kinetic energy flux KR and find that large sub-Alfvenic deflection angles tend to be dominated by SR, while super-Alfvenic deflections are eventually dominated by the KR associated with the radial solar wind flow. Our results show that within the vicinity of the Alfven surface (where Ma = 1), there is a critical region of parameter space within which velocity deflections approach the Alfven velocity and KR/SR is close to unity. We refer to this region (where | log10(Ma)| < 0.2) as the conversion layer. The conversion layer may play a significant role in the evolution of magnetic defections by providing the medium for converting magnetic energy to particle energy and likely driving the formation of magnetic switchbacks in super-Alfvenic solar wind.",

Precise physical parameters of the stellar components together with systematic measurements of the periastron advance are needed. We present new results of our long-term observational project to analyze the apsidal motion in early-type eccentric eclipsing binaries. New ground and space-based photometric data were obtained, and archival spectroscopic measurements were used in this study of two detached southern-hemisphere eclipsing binaries: V1647 Sgr (P=3.28 d, e=0.41), and V2283 Sgr (3.47, 0.49). Their TESS observations in four sectors have also been included and the corresponding light curves were solved using the Phoebe code. The newly completed O-C diagrams were analyzed using all reliable timings found in the literature and calculated using the TESS light curves. New or improved values were obtained for the elements of apsidal motion. Using archival spectroscopy for V1647 Sgr, the precise absolute parameters were improved: M1 = 2.184(0.035) M$_\\odot$, M2 = 1.957(0.035) M$_\\odot$, and R1 = 1.839(0.015) R$_\\odot$, R2 = 1.716(0.015) R$_\\odot$. For V2283 Sgr the absolute dimensions were newly estimated: M1 = 2.178(0.10) M$_\\odot$, M2 = 1.547(0.10) M$_\\odot$, and R1 = 1.796(0.01) R$_\\odot$, R2 = 1.544(0.01) R$_\\odot$. We improved relatively long periods of apsidal motion of about 580 and 530 years, together with the corresponding internal structure constants, log k2, -2.394, and -2.418, for V1647 Sgr and V2283 Sgr, respectively. The relativistic contribution to apsidal motion is not negligible, making about 12 resp. 14% of the total rate of apsidal motion. No signs of the presence of an additional body were revealed in the light curves or in the O-C diagrams of both eccentric systems.",

We construct two types of datasets using the Space Weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP), and develop a flare prediction network based on large language model (LLMFlareNet). We apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to explain the model predictions. We develop an operational forecasting system based on the LLMFlareNet model. We adopt a daily mode for performance comparison across various operational forecasting systems under identical active region (AR) number and prediction date, using daily operational observational data. The main results are as follows. (1) Through ablation experiments and comparison with baseline models, LLMFlareNet achieves the best TSS scores of 0.720 +/- 0.040 on the ten cross-validation (CV) dataset with mixed ARs. (2) By both global and local SHAP analyses, we identify that R_VALUE is the most influential physical feature for the prediction of LLMFlareNet, aligning with flare magnetic reconnection theory. (3) In daily mode, LLMFlareNet achieves TSS scores of 0.680/0.571 (0.689/0.661, respectively) on the dataset with single/mixed ARs, markedly outperforming NASA/CCMC (SolarFlareNet, respectively). This work introduces the first application of a large language model as a universal computation engine with explainability method in this domain, and presents the first comparison between operational flare forecasting systems in daily mode. The proposed LLMFlareNet-based system demonstrates substantial improvements over existing systems.",

Accepted to ApJL Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We investigated the three-dimensional (3D) magnetic structures and dynamics responsible for particle acceleration in an X7.1-class flare that occurred on October 1, 2024, in NOAA active region 13842. We combined stereoscopic hard X-ray (HXR) observations from the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory/Hard X-ray Imager (HXI) and the Solar Orbiter/Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) with a 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation constrained by observed photospheric magnetic fields. During the two main peaks of the impulsive phase, HXR footpoints appeared at different locations, indicating a migration of the primary reconnection site in the corona. Our data-constrained MHD simulation successfully reproduced the reconnected field lines linking the observed conjugate HXR footpoints. Furthermore, the simulation shows that these primary reconnections occur along a single quasi-separatrix layer (QSL) system. Therefore, the two main peaks of HXR can be interpreted as episodic energy release within the single QSL system. This study demonstrates that the data-constrained MHD model provides a realistic 3D magnetic context for interpreting HXR emission. Notably, STIX observations revealed a vertically distributed thermal HXR source, extending from the footpoints to the looptop, with its centroid migrating between the two peaks. This marks a first step toward understanding the particle acceleration processes in solar flares.",

We use a light curve from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and published spectroscopic results to determine the physical properties of the system to high precision. We find masses of 1.617 +/- 0.003 Msun and 1.207 +/- 0.004 Msun, and radii of 1.948 +/- 0.008 Rsun and 1.195 +/- 0.022 Rsun. The precision of the radius measurements is limited by the shallow partial eclipses and the unavailability of a spectroscopic light ratio due to the chemical peculiarity of the primary star. We measure a distance to the system of 125.0 +/- 1.5 pc, in good agreement with the Gaia DR3 parallax, and an age of 1.3 Gyr. A comparison with theoretical models suggests the system has a modestly sub-solar metallicity, in conflict with the slightly super-solar photospheric abundances of the secondary star.",

Existing sunspot simulations fail to reproduce the observed magnetic field distribution due to an artificially increased $B_{hor}$ at the upper boundary. Aims. We explore alternative ways to better reproduce the magnetic and dynamic properties of observed sunspots. Methods. We use the radiative MHD code MURaM. As initial conditions, we placed a potential magnetic field into small-scale dynamo simulations and used potential-field extrapolation at the top. Results. We find that: (1) Simulations with increasing initial magnetic field strengths (20, 40, 80, and 160 kG) show larger spots, umbrae, and penumbrae. (2) The penumbral-to-spot sizes are smaller than those measured in observed sunspots. (3) In none of the runs are pure Evershed (radially outward) flows. Instead, bi-directional flows with inflows in the inner penumbra and outflows in the outer penumbra were measured, similar to early observations of penumbra formation for runs with $\\ge80$ kG at 96/32 km resolution, whereas runs with 40 kG or less showed pure inflows. (4) Simulations with 160 kG at 32/16 km resolution contain filaments with bi-directional and Evershed flows. (5) Simulations with fluxes $>10^{22}$ Mx show unrealistically strong fields in the umbra. (6) The best runs with 160 kG and $10^{22}$ Mx give realistic radial profiles of $B_z$ and $B_r$, although stronger fields than observed. (7) Increasing the width of the box and reducing the overall flux by subtracting a uniform opposing vertical field have little influence on internal spot dynamics and fields, but change the mean vertical field outside the spot. Conclusions. Simulations of small ($10^{22}$) sunspots with an initial potential field and intensified bottom magnetic field strength best reproduce observations of the initial stages of sunspot formation. Numerical resolution may be critical for achieving fully developed penumbrae.",

Dullemond 21 pages, 31 figures, accepted to Astronomy & Astrophysics Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Stellar fly-bys can have multiple dynamical effects on protoplanetary disks, including warping and the excitation of spiral arms. Since observations indicate that warps are common, we aim to investigate these effects for different fly-by trajectories. We further link our models to observations by applying them to the RW Aur system, which is a fly-by candidate with a relatively well constrained trajectory. We investigate the disk dynamics in grid-based hydrodynamical simulations, which allow for a lower disk viscosity than commonly used SPH models. We post-process our simulations of the RW Aur system with radiative transfer models to create synthetic images of the dust continuum and gas kinematics. Fly-bys inclined with respect to the original disk plane can excite warps of a few degrees: the exact outcome depends on the specific geometry of the encounter. Specifically, we find that the position of the periastron with respect to the initial disk plane plays a role for the resulting warp strength. Within our parameter set, the strongest warp is excited for a retrograde fly-by with a periastron that is not in the same plane as the disk. Our models show that the warp can persist even after the perturber can no longer be clearly linked to the system, implying that past fly-bys are a possible origin of observed warps. Excited spirals arms, on the other hand, are much more short-lived than the warp. The RW Aur system presents a perfect opportunity to apply these results: we find that a warp of about 5° can be excited, and that the strong spiral arms have already disappeared at the current time of observation 300 years after periastron). This compares well with existing continuum observations, and our synthetic kinematic evaluations hint at remnant structures in the gas density that may be detectable.",

Beck Accepted for publication in Astronomy&Astrophysics (14 pages, 9 Figures, 2 online tables) Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Red giants are increasingly used as stellar population tracers due to their well-understood evolution and the availability of asteroseismic observables. However, stellar binarity can alter observable properties and introduce strong biases. We aim to provide a holistic picture of the binary population and its evolution in the red giant phase by characterizing a sample of binaries hosting oscillating red giants from a combination of extensive asteroseismic, spectroscopic, and astrometric surveys. We investigate the binary properties of evolved stars in the APOKASC3 and APO-K2 catalogs, leveraging asteroseismic constraints and Gaia DR3 non-single-star solutions. We explore the mass distribution of red-giant binary systems and analyze the evolution of their binary fraction. For stars with M$\\leq$1.8M$_\\odot$, we find binary fractions $\\sim$31% and $\\sim$41% for oscillating and non-oscillating solar-like stars on the main-sequence (MS). By the power excess ($\\nu_\\mathrm{max}$) as luminosity proxy, we detect a binary attrition of $\\sim$69% and $\\sim$81% on the low- and high-luminosity red-giant branch (RGB) and an additional $\\sim$38% to the red clump (RC), with respect to the MS. Binaries hosting RC and secondary clump stars (2RC) stars are largely depleted at $P_\\mathrm{orb}\\lesssim$500 and $\\lesssim$200 days, respectively. Mass-dependent differences in binary fractions and orbital properties point to more substantial binary attrition for stars with M $\\leq$1.8 M$_\\odot$. The distinct mass distributions and the depletion of short-period binaries during the red-giant phase underscore the impact of stellar expansion and binary interactions on stellar evolution. RC systems with $P_\\mathrm{orb}\\lesssim$800 to 1,000 days are likely shaped by past interactions, such as mass transfer or loss, which can lead to significantly biased age estimates if not accounted for.",

The observed thinness of the tachocline is a long-standing dynamical puzzle because the tachocline should have spread significantly due to inward-burrowing meridional circulation, also called \"radiative spreading.\" We recently presented the first pair of global simulations to reveal a statistically stationary tachocline confined against radiative spreading by the Maxwell stresses from the nonaxisymmetric modes of a dynamo, which penetrated into and below the tachocline through a novel magnetic skin effect. In the work presented here, we systematically examine how this \"dynamo confinement scenario\" works against radiative spreading in a suite of simulations as the governing parameters trend in the direction of the true solar regime. We find that as the stable stratification of the radiative zone is made progressively stronger, the dynamo cycles get longer, the magnetic field consequently penetrates deeper due to the skin effect, and the tachocline becomes more confined. Furthermore, these results have interesting consequences for solar spin-down. In all of our radiatively spreading simulations, the tachocline region spins down due to the burrowing circulation. Below the tachocline, the Maxwell stresses transmit this spin-down further to rigidify the deeper radiative zone. We thus speculate that, in addition to confining the tachocline, the dynamo may provide a pathway to communicate spin-down from the near-surface layers to the deep interior.",

This article has been accepted for publication in \"Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan'' published by Oxford University Press Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The 6.7 GHz methanol maser in a high-mass star-forming region G33.641$-$0.228 is known to exhibit burst-like flux variability due to an unknown mechanism. To investigate the burst mechanism, we conducted high-cadence flux and circular polarization monitoring observations, simultaneously using left- and right-hand circular polarizations. We found that the flux density increased and decreased on a short timescale of 0.3 d during a burst. We also found strong circular polarization, reaching up to 20\\% in the component exhibiting the bursts. Circular polarization of 0--20\\% was continuously observed from 2009 to 2016, even in the quiescent period. The polarization also varied on timescales of less than one day. When a burst occurred and the flux density increased, the circular polarization decreased to zero. To explain the observational properties of the flux variability and circular polarization, we propose a model in which an explosive event similar to a solar radio burst occurs on the line of sight behind the maser cloud, producing circularly polarized continuum emission due to gyro-synchrotron or gyro-resonance radiation, which is then amplified by the maser.",

Calkins Geophysics (physics.geo-ph); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Understanding the asymptotic behaviour of numerical dynamo models is critical for extrapolating results to the physical conditions that characterise terrestrial planetary cores. Here we investigate the behaviour of convection-driven dynamos reaching a MAC (magnetic-Archimedes-Coriolis) balance on the convective length scale and compare the results with non-magnetic convection cases. In particular, the dependence of physical quantities on the Ekman number, $Ek$, is studied in detail. The scaling of velocity dependent quantities is observed to be independent of the force balance and in agreement with quasi-geostrophic theory. The primary difference between dynamo and non-magnetic cases is that the fluctuating temperature is order unity in the former such that the buoyancy force scales with the Coriolis force. The MAC state yields a scaling for the flow speeds that is identical to the so-called CIA (Coriolis-inertia-Archimedes) scaling. There is an $O(Ek^{1/3})$ length scale present within the velocity field irrespective of the leading order force balance. This length scale is consistent with the asymptotic scaling of the terms of the governing equations and is not an indication that viscosity plays a dominant role. The peak of the kinetic energy spectrum and the ohmic dissipation length scale both exhibit an Ekman number dependence of approximately $Ek^{1/6}$, which is consistent with a scaling of $Rm^{-1/2}$, where $Rm$ is the magnetic Reynolds number. For the dynamos, advection remains comparable to, and scales similarly with, both inertia and viscosity, implying that nonlinear convective Rossby waves play an important role in the dynamics even in a MAC regime.",

Learning-based denoising is promising, yet progress is hindered by scarce paired training data and the need for physically interpretable and reproducible models in scientific workflows. We propose a physics-based noise synthesis framework tailored to CCD noise formation. The pipeline models photon shot noise, photo-response non-uniformity, dark-current noise, readout effects, and localized outliers arising from cosmic-ray hits and hot pixels. To obtain low-noise inputs for synthesis, we average multiple unregistered exposures to produce high-SNR bases. Realistic noisy counterparts synthesized from these bases using our noise model enable the construction of abundant paired datasets for supervised learning. We further introduce a real-world dataset across multi-bands acquired with two twin ground-based telescopes, providing paired raw frames and instrument-pipeline calibrated frames, together with calibration data and stacked high-SNR bases for real-world evaluation.",

Arnold, J.-D. do Nascimento Jr., N. J. Cook, R. Doyon Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) M dwarfs are prime targets in the search for exoplanets because of their prevalence and because low-mass planets can be better detected with radial velocity (RV) methods. In particular, the near-infrared (NIR) spectral domain offers an increased RV sensitivity and potentially reduced stellar activity signals. Howevern precise NIR RV measurements can be strongly affected by telluric absorption lines from the Earth's atmosphere. We searched for planets orbiting Gl 725 B, a nearby late-M dwarf at $3.5$ pc, using high-precision SPIRou RV observations. We assessed the impact of telluric contamination and evaluated the performance of the weighted principal component analysis reconstruction method (WAPITI), designed to mitigate these systematics and improve planet detectability. Using synthetic and observational SPIRou data, we simulated telluric effects on RVs under varying barycentric Earth radial velocity (BERV) conditions and applied WAPITI to correct line-by-line RVs. The method was tested through injection-recovery experiments and applied to real SPIRou observations of Gl 725 B. WAPITI efficiently corrects telluric contamination in simulated and real datasets, enhancing the detectability and accuracy of planetary signals. We identify a two-planet system around Gl 725 B composed of a candidate inner planet (Gl 725 Bb) with a period of $4.765 \\pm 0.004$ days and semi-amplitude $1.4 \\pm 0.3$ m.s$^{-1}$, and a confirmed outer planet (Gl 725 Bc) with a period of $37.90 \\pm 0.17$ days and semi-amplitude $1.7 \\pm 0.3$ m.s$^{-1}$. Their minimum masses are $1.5 \\pm 0.4$ and $3.5 \\pm 0.7$ M$_\\oplus$, respectively, and the outer planet lies in the habitable zone. Using a multi-dimensional Gaussian process framework to model stellar activity, we also recover a stellar rotation period of $105.1 \\pm 3.3$ days.",

These experiments, operated as cryogenic calorimeters at $\\sim$10 mK, are usually read out by high-impedance neutron transmutation doped (NTD) thermistors, which provide good energy resolution, but are limited by $\\sim$1 ms response times. Superconducting detectors, such as transition-edge sensors (TESs) with a time resolution of $\\sim$100 $\\mu$s, offer superior timing performance over NTD semiconductor bolometers. To make this technology viable for an application to a thousand or more channels, multiplexed readout is necessary in order to minimize the thermal load and radioactive contamination induced by the readout. Frequency-domain multiplexing readout (fMux) for TESs, previously developed at Berkeley Lab and McGill University, is currently in use for mm-wave telescopes with detector sampling rates in the order of 100 Hz. We demonstrate a new readout system, based on the McGill/Berkeley digital fMux readout, to satisfy the higher bandwidth and noise requirements of the next generation of TES-instrumented cryogenic calorimeters. The new readout samples detectors at 156 kHz, three orders of magnitude faster than its cosmology-oriented predecessor. Each multiplexing readout module comprises ten superconducting resonators in the MHz range and a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), interfaced to high-bandwidth field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based electronics for digital signal processing and low-latency feedback.",

We have built a nonlinear curvature WFS to study different wavefront reconstruction methods and test the ability to extract tip/tilt information. Using reliable and fast centroiding algorithms, combined with knowledge of the measured $z$-distance to each measurement plane, we demonstrate that image jitter may be sensed and compensated for using a fast steering mirror and the WFS in closed loop. This approach obviates the need for peripheral components such as quad-cells or access to a separate scientific imaging channel. Our laboratory experiments validate tip/tilt estimation and correction using nlCWFS data, achieving tip/tilt accuracy of +/-0.1, lambda/D for an unaberrated beam and better than ~+/-0.5, lambda/D in the presence of aberrations, consistent with prior numerical simulations.

Alternative photo-z methods have been developed, largely within the context of low-redshift optical surveys. Machine learning based approaches have gained footing in this regime, including those that utilize raw pixel information instead of aperture photometry. However, the efficacy of image-based algorithms on high-redshift, near-infrared data remains underexplored. Here, we test the performance of Detection, Instance Segmentation and Classification with Deep Learning (DeepDISC) on photometric redshift estimation with NIRCam images from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. DeepDISC is designed to produce probabilistic photometric redshift estimates directly from images, after detecting and deblending sources in a scene. Using NIRCam-only images and a compiled catalog of spectroscopic redshifts, we show that DeepDISC produces reliable photo-zs and uncertainties comparable to those estimated from template fitting using HST+JWST filters; DeepDISC even outperforms template fitting (lower scatter/fewer outliers) when the input photometric filters are matched. Compared with template fitting, DeepDISC does not require measured photometry from images, and can produce a catalog of 94000 photo-zs in ~4 minutes on a single NVIDIA A40 GPU. While current spectroscopic training samples are small and incomplete in color-magnitude space, this work demonstrates the potential of DeepDISC for increasingly larger image volumes and spectroscopic samples from ongoing and future programs. We discuss the impact of the training data on applications to broader samples and produce a catalog of photo-zs for all JADES DR2 photometric sources in the GOOD-S field, with quality flags indicating caveats.",

In this work, we apply ExoMiner++ 2.0, an adaptation of the ExoMiner++ framework originally developed for TESS 2-minute data, to FFI light curves. The model is used to perform large-scale planet versus non-planet classification of Threshold Crossing Events across the sectors analyzed in this study. We construct a uniform vetting catalog of all evaluated signals and assess model performance under different observing conditions. We find that ExoMiner++ 2.0 generalizes effectively to the FFI domain, providing robust discrimination between planetary signals, astrophysical false positives, and instrumental artifacts despite the limitations inherent to longer cadence data.

Here, we propose a novel method to determine the immiscibility boundary accurately without the need for free energy calculations, while providing consistent insights into structural and transport properties of mixtures. We show with direct large-scale ab initio simulations that the insulator-metal transition (IMT) of the hydrogen subsystem is strongly affected by an admixture with a small fraction of helium and occurs at temperatures significantly higher than those of pure hydrogen. At pressures below 150 GPa, the IMT boundary is not related anymore to the H2 subsystem dissociation, the system remains insulating even after the full dissociation of H2 molecules and its transition to an H-He mixture. The offset of the IMT in the H-He mixture relative to the dissociation region in the hydrogen subsystem and the significant reduction of static electrical and thermal conductivity by a factor between two and a few thousand relative to pure hydrogen found in mixtures have consequences for Jupiter and Saturn's thermal evolution, internal structure, and dynamo action, affecting a large fraction of the interior of both planets.",

      "abstract": "The Effect of Tidal Heating and Volatile Budgets on the Outgassed Atmosphere of 55 Cancri e Barron K. Nguyen, Laura K. Schaefer, Fei Dai, Héctor E. Delgado-Díaz Accepted for publication in ApJ (The Astrophysical Journal), 2026 Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) 55 Cancri e is a $\\sim$8 Gyr rocky world (1.95 $R_\\oplus$, 8.8 $M_\\oplus$) orbiting a K-type star. JWST observations suggest a carbon-dominated atmosphere (CO$_2$/CO) over a global magma ocean ($>$3000 K). We suggest that any CO$_2$-dominated atmosphere, with trace H$_2$O/O$_2$, likely arises from outgassing of its initial volatile reservoir. As solidification drives the magma ocean and atmosphere away from solution-equilibrium, tidal and greenhouse heating can prolong outgassing. Early atmosphere outgassing reflects rapid degassing of the volatile-saturated melt during post-formation cooling. Without tidal heating, an initial 5 wt% water mass fraction ($F_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$) or 3 wt% $\\text{CO}_2$ mass fraction ($F_{\\text{CO}_2}$) can sustain outgassing for at least $\\sim$10 Myr. With both at 10 wt%, greenhouse warming alone can prolong outgassing up to $\\sim$30 Myr. Our model shows that tidal heating can reduce the volatile threshold required to maintain a high surface temperature ($\\sim$3200 K at $e = 0.005$) and delay outgassing of additional volatiles to the present-day. However, higher tidal heating presents a tradeoff between prolonging tenuous outgassing and enlarging the overall size of the secondary atmosphere. Tidally-enhanced outgassing may produce minor pressure variations that could contribute to the observed phase-curve variability. Additionally, our model shows that tidal heating strongly controls outgassing in the planet's young-to-midlife stage, then shifts toward a volatile inventory dependence at mature ages. Using 55 Cnc e, we present a framework to prioritize atmosphere detections on rocky ultra short period (USP) magma ocean planets, linking age-dependent tidal heating and volatile inventory to the formation and size of secondary atmospheres.",

      "abstract": "Sculpting of Martian brain terrain reveals the drying of ancient Mars Shenyi Zhang, Lei Zhang, Yutian Ke, Jinhai Zhang Geophysics (physics.geo-ph); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph) The Martian brain terrain (MBT), characterized by its unique brain-like morphology, is a potential geological archive for finding hints of paleoclimatic conditions during its formation period. The morphological similarity of MBT to self-organized patterned ground on Earth suggests a shared formation mechanism. However, the lack of quantitative descriptions and robust physical modeling of self-organized stone transport jointly limits the study of the thermal and aqueous conditions governing MBT's formation. Here we established a specialized quantitative system for extracting the morphological features of MBT, taking a typical region located in the northern Arabia Terra as an example, and then employed a numerical model to investigate its formation mechanisms. Our simulation results accurately replicate the observed morphology of MBT, matching its key geometric metrics with deviations $<10\\%$. Crucially, however, we find that the self-organized transport can solely produce relief $<0.5$ m, insufficient to explain the formation of MBT with average relief of $3.29 \\pm 0.65$ m. We attribute this discrepancy to sculpting driven by late-stage sublimation, constraining cumulative subsurface ice loss in this region to $\\sim 3$ meters over the past $\\sim 3$ Ma. These findings demonstrate that MBT's formation is a multi-stage process: initial patterning driven by freeze-thaw cycles (implying liquid water) followed by vertical sculpting via sublimation (requiring a dry environment). This evolution provides physical evidence for the transition of the ancient Martian climate from a wetter period to a colder hyper-arid state.",

      "abstract": "Close-in compact super-Earth systems emerging from resonant chains: slow destabilization by unseen remnants of formation Max Goldberg, Antoine C. Petit Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Planet formation simulations consistently predict compact systems of numerous small planets in chains of mean motion resonances formed by planet-disk interaction, but transiting planet surveys have found most systems to be non-resonant and somewhat dynamically excited. A scenario in which nearly all of the primordial resonant chains undergo dynamical instabilities and collisions has previously been found to closely match many features of the observed planet sample. However, existing models have not been tested against new observations that show a steep decline in the resonant fraction as a function of stellar age on a timescale of ~100 Myr. We construct a simplified model incorporating Type I migration, growth from embryos, and N-body integrations continued to 500 Myr and use it to generate a synthetic planet population. Nearly all systems exit the disk phase in a resonant configuration but begin slowly diffusing away from the center of the resonance. Dynamical instabilities can arise on timescales of tens or hundreds of Myr, especially when systems formed in disks with a convergent migration trap. In this case, a secondary chain of smaller planets that remained at their birth location eventually breaks, destabilizing the inner resonant chain. We also show that the instability statistics are well modeled by a Weibull distribution, and use this to extrapolate our population to Gyr ages. The close match of our modeled systems to the observed population implies that the high resonance fraction predicted by this class of models is in fact consistent with the data, and the previously-reported overabundance of resonant systems was a consequence of comparing simulations of early evolution to mature Gyr-old systems. This result also suggests that instabilities triggered by disk dissipation or other very early mechanisms are unlikely to be consistent with observed young systems.",

Lister, Helen Usher, Colin Snodgrass, Bjorn Davidsson, Sarah Greenstreet Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) reached perihelion at 0.33 au on 2025 October 8. Daily monitoring by the LCO Outbursting Objects Key Project revealed a major activity increase between November 2 and 4, accompanied by rapid changes in coma morphology. Serendipitous HST/STIS acquisition images obtained on November 8-10 captured the comet only days after this event and resolved five fragments, providing an early high-resolution view of a nucleus in the process of disruption. Fragment motions and morphologies indicate a hierarchical fragmentation sequence, including a slow secondary split of fragment II. Back extrapolation shows that both the primary and secondary breakups preceded their associated photometric outbursts by roughly one to three days. This consistent lag, together with the appearance of thin, short-lived arclets around fragment I in the first HST epoch, suggests that freshly exposed interior material warms rapidly but requires time before dust can be released efficiently. Given the comet's close perihelion passage, rotational instability driven by enhanced outgassing torques is a plausible contributor to nucleus disintegration and dust release, and may represent the primary source of the observed brightening. These combined ground- and space-based observations provide rare, time-resolved constraints on the thermal and structural evolution of a fragmented comet near perihelion and highlight the scientific value of capturing a nucleus within days of disruption, when thermal adjustment, dust mantle re-formation, and outgassing-driven torques jointly govern the onset of activity.",
