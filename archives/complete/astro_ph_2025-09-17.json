      "abstract": "CWT-LSTM Autoencoder: A Novel Approach for Gravitational Wave Detection in Synthetic Data Jericho Cain Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Gravitational wave detection requires sophisticated signal processing to identify weak astrophysical signals buried in instrumental noise. Traditional matched filtering approaches face computational challenges with diverse signal morphologies and non-stationary noise. This work presents a deep learning approach combining Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) preprocessing with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder architecture for gravitational wave detection in synthetic data. The CWT provides optimal time-frequency decomposition capturing chirp evolution and transient characteristics essential for compact binary coalescence identification. The LSTM autoencoder learns compressed representations while maintaining sensitivity to subtle signal features distinguishing true astrophysical events from noise artifacts. We generate realistic synthetic datasets incorporating binary black hole merger signals with masses ranging from 10 to 80 solar masses, embedded in colored Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity. The trained model demonstrates strong performance metrics: 92.3 percent precision, 67.6 percent recall, and 80.6 percent AUC-ROC, with an average precision score of 0.780. These results exceed LIGO's stringent detection thresholds for confident gravitational wave identification. Compared to traditional approaches, the CWT-LSTM autoencoder shows superior ability to maintain low false alarm rates while preserving sensitivity to weak signals. The method's end-to-end learning eliminates hand-crafted features and template banks, offering a promising pathway toward more robust gravitational wave detection systems. The unsupervised nature enables discovery of signals with unknown morphologies, providing complementary \"blind search\" capability for detecting exotic astrophysical sources and novel physics beyond current theoretical models.",

Scóccola Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We investigate the cosmological imprint of self-interacting dark radiation (DR) on the primordial $B$-mode angular power spectrum and its impact on the estimation of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We consider a minimal model in which DR is described as an effectively massless axion-like particle with quartic self-interactions. These interactions are incorporated into the Einstein-Boltzmann equations using the relaxation time approximation and implemented in the $\\texttt{CLASS}$ code. We show that increasing the strength of DR self-interactions suppresses anisotropic stress, thereby reducing the damping of gravitational waves and leading to an enhancement of the primordial $B$-mode signal relative to the free-streaming case. Using mock CMB data and Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses, we show that neglecting DR self-interactions may bias the inferred value of $r$ by an amount comparable to the uncertainty expected in forthcoming CMB polarization experiments, such as the ground-based $\\textit{Simons Observatory}$ and the satellite missions $\\textit{LiteBIRD}$ and PICO. Our results emphasize the importance of properly modeling DR interactions in future precision searches for primordial $B$-modes in order to obtain unbiased constraints on inflationary gravitational waves.",

We consider three dark energy models ($\\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM) and three mass hierarchies. Our results indicate that in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, adding JWST data to CMB+DESI tightens the upper limit of $\\sum m_{\\nu}$ by about $5.8\\%-10.2\\%$, and we obtain $\\sum m_{\\nu} < 0.167~\\mathrm{eV}$ ($2\\sigma$) in the normal hierarchy (NH) case.

In this study, we analyse the emission and observational properties of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a Hernquist dark matter (DM) halo by considering three simplified accretion models, which have not been previously explored in such detail. Based on our findings, direct emission contributes markedly to the whole observed intensity for a Schwarzschild-Hernquist black hole encircled by a geometrically thin accretion disk. The corresponding regions and measured intensities of the lensing ring, the photon ring, and direct emission are sensitive to the parameters of the Hernquist DM halo. Apart from disk accretion, we also study two spherical accretion models: static and infalling. With increasing Hernquist DM parameters, both models exhibit a significant decrease in the measured intensity, yet the photon spheres are enlarged by an increase of $\\sim2\\%$ to $\\sim30\\%$. Furthermore, Doppler de-boosting due to the infalling accretion results in darker shadow images compared to static cases. By precising visualisations of the shadows, our results suggest that the observational characteristics of black hole shadows can serve as a powerful probe for distinguishing between different DM distributions around supermassive black holes.",

While one pathway involves the isolated evolution of massive binary stars, affected by uncertain stages like core-collapse supernovae and common envelope evolution, an alternative channel is dynamical formation in dense stellar environments. Newtonian gravity has traditionally provided a robust and computationally efficient framework for modeling large-scale gravitational interactions. However, accurately capturing close encounters and black hole mergers necessitates the use of general relativity. This work focuses on assessing the applicability of post-Newtonian gravity in bridging these regimes, offering a physically insightful and computationally tractable approach to modeling BBH formation in the gravitational-wave era of astronomy.",

However, this view is being completely altered by the early dark energy (EDE) resolutions of the Hubble tension, known as the most prominent tension the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model is suffering from. In corresponding models with pre-recombination EDE, resolving the Hubble tension (i.e., achieving $H_0\\sim 73$km/s/Mpc) must be accompanied by a shift of $n_s$ towards unity to maintain consistency with the cosmological data, which thus implies a scale invariant Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum with $n_s=1$ $(|n_s-1|\\simeq {\\cal O}(0.001))$. In this work, we strengthen and reconfirm this result with the latest ground-based CMB data from ACT DR6 and SPT-3G D1, the precise measurements at high multipoles beyond the Planck angular resolution and sensitivity. Our work again highlights the importance of re-examining our understanding on the very early Universe within the broader context of cosmological tensions.",

We address two viable scenarios for the transition to quark matter: a quark-hadron crossover (QHC) or a strong first-order phase transition (1PT). To distinguish between different models, we define neutron-quark stars (NQS) as configurations where quark effects emerge at masses below the lowest observed neutron-star mass. While traditional \"hybrid stars\" may be distinguished by purely hadronic configurations through mass-radius measurements, the mass-radius relations of NQSs resemble those of purely hadronic models, with no sharp boundary between hadrons and quarks. The name NQS effectively captures the absence of a phase boundary between hadrons and quarks in QHC scenarios. Our results indicate that QHC models can be distinguished from hadronic ones if both the inspiral and postmerger gravitational waves (GWs) are observed. In particular, the dominant postmerger frequency ($f_2$) tends to be lower than in hadronic models with the same tidal deformability ($\\Lambda$). We also present the first general-relativistic simulations of BNS mergers where the stars already contain quark matter before merging. These involve a strong first-order phase transition (1PT) at 1.8 times nuclear saturation density, followed by a stiff quark EOS. Finally, we identify a robust linear correlation between the total GW energy emitted after the merger and the $f_2$ frequency. Remarkably, this relation holds regardless of the quark presence.",

To be published in Chinese Physics C Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) $F(R)$ models for dark energy generally exhibit a weak curvature singularity, which can be cured by adding an $R^2$ term. This correction allows for a unified description of primordial and late-time accelerated expansions. However, most existing models struggle to achieve this, as they become unstable over certain negative ranges of the Ricci scalar, where either the first or second derivative of $F(R)$ turns negative. These instabilities may disrupt the post-inflationary evolution when the Ricci scalar oscillates about the vacuum state after the $R^2$ inflation. In this work, we introduce a new model-building to guarantee global stability, i.e., the first and second derivatives are positive for all real Ricci scalars. By extending the idea from Appleby and Battye, we demonstrate that viable models can be constructed by imposing a positive, bounded first derivative of $F(R)$ with a sigmoid shape. As examples, we first reformulate and generalize the original Appleby-Battye model. Then, we propose a new dark energy model, which successfully explains the acceleration of cosmic expansion and passes local gravity tests.",

Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\\Gamma \\equiv \\log_{10}\\sqrt{G/G_{\\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\\rm N}>10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$, while it is $\\Gamma=0.063_{-0.047}^{+0.058}$ or $0.134_{-0.040}^{+0.050}$ for $7\\text{ or }8$ binaries with $g_{\\rm N}<10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$ (depending on one system) showing tension with Newton. The Newtonian ``outlier'' is at the boundary set by the Newtonian escape velocity, but can be consistent with modified gravity. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring gravity at low acceleration with future samples of wide binaries.",

Forming ~10^9 Msun SMBHs by z ~ 6 is challenging and may require hierarchical mergers of smaller seed black holes. We extend a semi-analytic seed model (Sassano et al. 2021) by explicitly incorporating GW recoil physics. Our model includes: (1) recoil velocity formulae calibrated to numerical relativity for spinning, unequal-mass BH binaries (Campanelli et al. 2007; Lousto et al. 2012); (2) assignment of spin magnitudes and orientations based on seed type (Pop III remnant, stellar cluster, or direct-collapse); and (3) a retention probability scheme comparing the recoil speed to the host halo escape velocity. We find that including GW recoil reduces final SMBH masses by ~20-30% by z = 6 and creates a population of off-nuclear (\"wandering\") BHs amounting to a few percent of the total. Observable consequences include spatial offsets ~0.1 arcsec and line-of-sight velocity shifts ~10^2-10^3 km/s in a few percent of high-z quasars. All code is publicly available at this https URL",

We demonstrate that deriving power spectrum estimators directly by linearly combining auto- and cross-spectra instead of maps allows us to obtain a different constrained-optimization problem that allows fewer (deprojection) constraint equations than combining at map level using the constrained ILC method. Through simulations, we show that our Spectral internal linear combination (SpILC) produces CMB power spectrum estimators with more than 7 times smaller errorbars than constrained ILC (with thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and cosmic infrared background deprojections) at $\\ell\\gtrsim 4000$ for Simons Observatory-like observations. Spectral ILC outperforms constrained ILC methods when some modeled components are spatially uncorrelated, e.g. the primary CMB is uncorrelated with foregrounds, and the difference in performance is most significant at noise-dominated scales. More generally, our work shows that component-separated maps with foreground deprojections do not necessarily produce minimum-variance two-or-higher-point estimators.",

Their formation is highly sensitive to non-Gaussian features in the primordial curvature perturbation {\\zeta}. In this work we inves- tigate PBH production in the curvaton scenario, where the decay of a late-time light scalar field imprints large, inherently non-Gaussian fluctuations on small scales. Using the exact non-linear mapping between the Gaussian curvaton field perturbations and {\\zeta}, we compute the full non-perturbative probability distribution functions of {\\zeta} and derive the PBH for- mation fraction \\b{eta} without relying on a truncated non-Gaussian expansion. We show that the enhanced tail of the distribution dramatically amplifies PBH production, leading to an exponential sensitivity of \\b{eta} to the curvaton decay fraction {\\Omega}\\c{hi},dec. By modeling the scale dependence of curvaton fluctuations with a lognormal profile, we obtain realistic, extended PBH mass spectra rather than monochromatic peaks. We further highlight the associated stochastic gravitational-wave background induced at second order, whose peak frequency correlates directly with the PBH mass scale. Our results demonstrate that the curvaton scenario naturally produces a rich phenomenology of PBHs and gravitational waves, sharply distinct from Gaussian single-field inflation models, and provide a framework for connecting small-scale non-Gaussian physics to upcoming gravitational-wave and PBH observations.",

The 21-cm line of hydrogen atoms is the most promising probe of these epochs, with extensive observational efforts underway. We combine hydrodynamical simulations with a large-scale grid in order to precisely calculate the effect of non-linear structure formation on the global (sky-averaged) 21-cm radio intensity. We show that it presents a potential opportunity to probe the properties of dark matter in a new regime, corresponding to a length-scale of only 150,000 light years and a mass-scale of 20 million Solar masses. This effect can in principle be detected unambiguously during the Dark Ages, where the weak signal requires an array of global signal antennae. During Cosmic Dawn, when stellar radiation boosts the signal, a single global antenna suffices, but the clumping effect must then be separated from the effect of the stars. Our findings open new avenues for testing the nature of dark matter as well as non-standard cosmological models.",

Using an updated version of the GAMETE/QSOdust semi-analytical model, we implement a simple dust shielding prescription that accounts for the absorption of LW photons by dust grains. We find that even modest dust enrichment can significantly reduce the effective LW radiation field, allowing H2 cooling to persist in regions previously thought to be affected by LW feedback. This changes the conditions for seed formation, particularly for heavy seeds which require suppression of H2 cooling. Our results suggest that dust shielding extends the redshift range and volume where heavy seeds can form, and significantly alters the relative importance of different seed populations. We discuss the implications for the formation of high-redshift SMBHs and future observations.",

We combine hydrodynamical simulations with a large-scale grid in order to calculate the effect of non-linear structure formation on the large-scale 21-cm power spectrum, focusing on redshifts $z=20-40$. As the clumping effect arises from small-scale density fluctuations, it offers a unique opportunity to probe the standard cold dark matter model in a new regime and thus potentially investigate the properties of dark matter. To this end, we also study a warm dark matter $-$ like model with a Gaussian cutoff on a scale of 50 kpc. We find that clumping has a significant impact on the large-scale 21-cm power spectrum. For example, for the Dark Ages case at $z=30$ and wavenumber $k=0.05$ Mpc$^{-1}$, small-scale clustering enhances the 21-cm power spectrum by $13\\%$. Once Lyman-$\\alpha$ coupling kicks in due to the first stars, the 21-cm signal strengthens, and the effect of clumping grows; it suppresses the observable power spectrum at $z=20$ by a factor of two, while the cutoff model has less than half the clumping impact. The clumping effect is significantly higher than the sensitivity of the planned Square Kilometre Array (SKA) AA$^\\star$ configuration, by up to a factor of 20 for standard cold dark matter, though detection will require separation from foregrounds and from astrophysical contributions to the 21-cm power spectrum.",

However, the resonant nature of Ly$\\alpha$ radiative transfer complicates the interpretation of observed data. In this study, we develop a fast and accurate analytic prescription for computing the Ly$\\alpha$ intensity field on Mpc scales in the post-reionization Universe. Motivated by insights from Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) experiments, we exploit the fact that in a highly ionized intergalactic medium (IGM) with negligible damping-wing opacity, cosmological redshifting quickly drives Ly$\\alpha$ photons out of resonance, terminating the scattering process and simplifying their large-scale behavior. Photons emitted blueward of the Ly$\\alpha$ line center tend to scatter on a thin, nearly spherical surface of last scattering, with a radius determined by the redshifting distance to resonance. Based on this behavior, we derive closed-form expressions for the scattered emissivity and projected surface brightness that depend only on the source spectrum, the HI density, and the peculiar velocity field. When applied to a source in a realistically simulated IGM at $z = 3$, our model shows mild discrepancies with MCRT results within a physical Mpc of the host halo, where strong gravitational infall redistributes the scattered photons, but achieves better than 5% accuracy beyond that distance in both raw and cumulative surface brightness. Our prescription offers a computationally efficient alternative to MCRT for forward-modeling Ly$\\alpha$ intensity maps from cosmological simulations, enabling the inference of underlying cosmological and astrophysical parameters from future observations.",

We include J-band data of four additional targets obtained with the three-channel camera at the 2m Fraunhofer telescope at the Wendelstein Observatory. We complement the new J-band photometric catalogue with forced photometry in the i- and z-bands of the tenth data release of the Legacy Survey (LSDR10) to derive the radial colour distribution around the eRASS1 clusters. Without assuming a priori to find a cluster red sequence at a specific colour, we try to find a radially weighted colour over-density to confirm the presence of high-redshift optical counterparts for the X-ray emission. We compare our confirmation with optical properties derived in earlier works based on LSDR10 data to refine the existing high-redshift cluster confirmation of eROSITA-selected clusters. We attempt to calibrate the colour-redshift-relation including the new J-band data by comparing our obtained photometric redshift estimate with the spectroscopic redshift of a confirmed, optically selected, high-redshift galaxy cluster. We confirm 9 out of 18 of the selected galaxy cluster candidates with a radial over-density of similar coloured galaxies for which we provide a photometric redshift estimate. We can report an increase in the relative colour measurement precision from 8% to 4% when including J-band data. In conclusion, our findings indicate a not insignificant spurious contaminant fraction at the high-redshift end (BEST_Z > 0.9) of the eROSITA/eRASS1 galaxy cluster catalogue, as well as it underlines the necessity for wide and deep near infrared imaging data for confirmation and characterisation of high-$z$ galaxy clusters.",

The article has been submitted, comments are welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Precise measurement of the sky radio brightness below 1 GHz and estimation of any unaccounted-for extragalactic brightness is required to understand the Galactic cosmic ray electron spectrum, to constrain populations of nanojansky radio sources, and to constrain dark matter annihilation or decay. The foreground radio brightness must also be accurately accounted for when measuring the cosmic background radiation and departures from its Planck spectrum that trace astrophysical processes in the early Universe, cosmic dark ages, cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionisation. Here we report a new, precision measurement of the sky spectral brightness over radio frequencies from 60 MHz to 350 MHz. Our measurement motivates a significant correction to previous all-sky images made in this band and the Global Sky Model (GSM) that is constructed from these and other sky images made at radio wavelengths. We find that the GSM requires subtraction of an offset exceeding 100K below 100 MHz and scaling up by a factor of approximately 1.2 below 200 MHz rising to a factor of 1.5 at 350 MHz, thus significantly enhancing previous estimates of unaccounted excess in radio sky brightness. Our measurements were made with a new receiver architecture that dynamically self-calibrates for receiver noise and bandpass in situ, while connected to an antenna. We used a single, accurately modelled, wideband logperiodic antenna placed on a 40m diameter ground mesh. Our accurate measurement requires upward revision of sky brightness and motivates revisiting models for source populations and dark matter decay. Additionally, sky models scaled to our measurements serve as a stable reference in calibrating the absolute flux density scale for low-frequency radio telescopes. This will be important for calibration accuracy of the SKA-Low telescope, that will operate at the frequencies of our measurements.",

Gupta Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) This paper aims to explore whether astrophysical observations, primarily galaxy rotation curves, result from covarying coupling constants (CCC) rather than from dark matter. We have shown in earlier papers that cosmological observations, such as supernovae type 1a (Pantheon+), the small size of galaxies at cosmic dawn, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), the sound horizon in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and time dilation effect, can be easily accounted for without requiring dark energy and dark matter when coupling constants are permitted to evolve in an expanding Universe, as predicted by Dirac, and the redshift is considered jointly due to the Universe's expansion and Zwicky's tired light (TL) effect. Here, we show that the CCC parameter {\\alpha} is responsible for generating the illusion of dark matter and dark energy, which we call {\\alpha}-matter and {\\alpha}-energy, and is influenced by the baryonic matter density distribution. While cosmologically {\\alpha} is a constant determined for the homogenous and isotropic Universe, e.g., by fitting Pantheon+ data, it can vary locally due to the extreme anisotropy of the matter distribution. Thus, in high baryonic density regions, one expects {\\alpha}-matter and {\\alpha}-energy densities to be relatively low and vice versa. We present its application to a few galaxy rotation curves from the SPARC database and find the results promising.",

Particles are considered bound if their energy does not exceed the escape energy of a potential well -- given by the closest saddle-point that connects to a deeper potential minimum. This approach has core benefits over previous approaches, since it does not require any ad-hoc thresholds (such as over-density criteria), it includes the gravitational effect of all particles in the binding criterion (improving over widely used self-potential binding checks) and it only operates with instantaneous information (making it simpler than approaches based on dynamical histories). We show that particles typically become bound between their first peri- and apo-centeric passage and that bound and unbound populations show very distinct characteristics through their distribution in phase space, their density profiles, their virial ratios, and their redshift evolution. Our findings suggest that it is possible to understand haloes as two-component systems, with one component being bound, virialized, of finite extent and evolving slowly in quasi-equilibrium and the other component being unbound, unvirialized and evolving rapidly.",

GNNs naturally handle inputs of variable length and resolution by representing each ICM profile as a graph, enabling accurate and flexible modeling across diverse observational conditions. We trained and tested GNN model using state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters from The Three Hundred Project. The mass estimates using our method exhibit no systematic bias compared to the true cluster masses in the simulations. Additionally, we achieve a scatter in recovered mass versus true mass of about 6\\%, which is a factor of six smaller than obtained from a standard hydrostatic equilibrium approach. Our algorithm is robust to both data quality and cluster morphology and it is capable of incorporating model uncertainties alongside observational uncertainties. Finally, we apply our technique to XMM-Newton observed galaxy cluster samples and compare the GNN derived mass estimates with those obtained with $Y_{\\rm SZ}$-M$_{500}$ scaling relations. Our results provide strong evidence, at 5$\\sigma$ level, for a mass-dependent bias in SZ derived masses, with higher mass clusters exhibiting a greater degree of deviation. Furthermore, we find the median bias to be $(1-b)=0.85_{-14}^{+34}$, albeit with significant dispersion due to its mass dependence. This work takes a significant step towards establishing unbiased observable mass scaling relations by integrating X-ray, SZ and optical datasets using deep learning techniques, thereby enhancing the role of galaxy clusters in precision cosmology.",

Hovhannisyan, L.A. Mahtessian, A.P. Mahtessian Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed massive, evolved galaxies only a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, challenging standard cosmological models. To test the hypothesis that the Galactic nucleus may act as a source of matter and energy capable of accelerating galaxy formation, we examined whether the Milky Way itself shows signs of central activity. Expansion of the Galactic center would imply such activity in its nuclear region. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed stellar motions along the south north axis of the Galaxy using Gaia DR3 data. Average Galactocentric radial velocities were computed in 50 control points, spaced by 0.1 kpc with a sampling radius of 0.05 kpc, up to 5 kpc from the Galactic center. The results show a strong symmetry: in the northern region, 36 of 50 points have positive velocities, with an average of 19.15 +/- 10.80 km/s (N = 50), while in the southern region, 37 of 50 points have negative velocities, with an average of - 19.24 +/- 8.22 km/s (N = 50). A Students t test confirms that the two distributions differ significantly (0.003). The combination of positive average velocities in the north and negative average velocities in the south indicates a symmetric outflow of stars away from the Galactic center, consistent with expansion in its central region. These Galactocentric radial velocities are consistent with the formation of massive, evolved galaxies within 300 My, as observed by JWST. If extended to other galaxies, the results (together with earlier findings on globular cluster motions) suggest that aspects of standard galaxy formation models may require refinement. This interpretation, however, remains preliminary and requires further study.",

Anstey, Eloy de Lera Acedo Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The global 21 cm signal from the hyperfine transition of cosmic atomic hydrogen is theorised to track the state of the early Universe via the analysis of its absorption and emission with respect to the radio background. Detecting this signal has been a challenge for astronomers since it was first postulated due to the presence of strong galactic foregrounds obfuscating the transition. Forward modelling techniques that aim to simulate and then remove these foregrounds have been suggested as a workaround to this problem. This technique, however, requires a precise and accurate understanding of the foregrounds in question. As we move into the next major lunar standstill, the moon will be able to occult high power areas of the sky in ways that are unaccounted for by maps used to simulate these foregrounds, and thereby disrupt signal recovery. We show that in toy cases an occultation from the moon, or other proximate object, leading to a mismatch in our expected and actual foregrounds of 15 parts per million increases the error in signal recovery of up to 20\\%. We show that this level of disruption can happen when the moon is found towards the centre of the galaxy and is amplified when this alignment happens at high directivity regions of the antenna beam, causing a disruption of up to 180 parts per million, leading to a signal recovery error of 115\\%. This allows us to identify lunar alignment scenarios that should be actively avoided to preserve signal fidelity. We also demonstrate that a body with a smaller apparent size than the moon, such as Venus, is unlikely to cause any signal disruption due to occultation, giving a base map error of <2 parts per million.",

We construct a Gibbs sampling scheme to recover the full joint posterior distribution of $\\sim 50,000$ parameters, representing the true sky brightness temperature field, as-yet uncorrected flux scale factors, and synchrotron power-law spectral indices.

For our fiducial scenario in which the global signal experiment has a 50 mK noise rms per coarse pixel in each of 20 frequency bins between 50 -- 150 MHz, we find that the notional Haslam flux scale factors can be recovered in most (but not all) sub-regions of the sky to an accuracy of $\\pm 2 \\%$.

Particularly, it is urgent to know what the difference of event rates between repeating and non-repeating FRBs is. For the first time, we calculate the event rates of repeating FRBs detected by diverse telescopes at frequencies higher/lower than 1 GHz in this work. Luminosity and redshift are found to be positively correlated with a power law form for both high- and low-frequency FRBs, showing an obvious evolution of luminosity with redshift. Furthermore, we compare the differential luminosity and local event rate distributions of high- and low-luminosity FRBs at different frequencies. It is found that the event rates of these sub-samples of repeating FRBs similarly exceed the star formation rate at lower redshift than 1. Interestingly, we confirm with bootstrap method that the event rates of low-frequency FRBs exhibit different evolution patterns and are higher than that of high-frequency ones.",

We categorise the SNe Ia into three distinct groups according to the distribution of their host galaxies on the star-formation rate (SFR) - stellar mass ($M_\\star$) plane. Each region comprises host galaxies at distinct stages in their evolutionary pathways: Region 1 - low-mass hosts; Region 2 - high-mass, star-forming hosts and Region 3 - high-mass, passive hosts. We find SNe Ia in host galaxies located in Region 1 have the steepest slope (quantified by $\\beta$) between their colours and luminosities, with $\\beta_{\\mathrm{R_1}} = 3.51 \\pm 0.16$. This differs at the ${\\sim}6\\sigma$ significance level to SNe Ia in Region 3, which have the shallowest colour-luminosity slope with $\\beta_{\\mathrm{R_3}} = 2.12 \\pm 0.16$. After correcting SNe Ia in each subsample by their respective $\\beta$, events in Region 3 (high-mass, passive hosts) are $0.07 - 0.12$ mag ($>3\\sigma$) brighter, post-standardisation.

Alternatively, cosmological analyses should restrict the SN Ia sample to events whose host galaxies occupy a single region of this plane.",

Castro v2: minor corrections; matches version to appear in PRD Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The advent of multimessenger cosmology, marked by the detection of GW170817, demonstrated that standard sirens are a valuable cosmological probe. In the absence of an electromagnetic counterpart identification, gravitational waves carry valuable information through the dark siren approach, where the source redshift is estimated using galaxy catalogs of potential hosts within the localisation volume. However, the DS analysis can be affected by galaxy catalog incompleteness at the limits of gravitational-wave detectability, potentially introducing biases in the constraints on cosmological parameters. Focusing on GWs from binary black holes detected by the LVK collaboration, we explore the possible systematic biases in the measurement of the $H_0$. These biases may arise from (1) the incompleteness of catalogs due to the apparent magnitude thresholds of optical telescope sensitivity, and (2) the use of incorrect weighting schemes for each potential host. We found that an unbiased estimate of $H_0$ can be obtained when the corrected weighting scheme is applied to a complete or volume-limited catalog. We use a complete galaxy catalog covering 90% of the localisation probability for each GW detection, employing stellar mass as a tracer. Our results show that a sample of 100 binary black hole events with $A_{90\\%}$<10 deg$^2$ and measured luminosity distances below 1600(2500) Mpc, detected by the LVK at O4(O5) sensitivity, can provide a percent-level measurement of $H_0$, with a precision of 3%(1%). This number of detections is expected to be accumulated after approximately 8 and 3 years of observations with the LVK at O4 and O5 sensitivity, respectively. The O5 run provides a reduction in the $H_0$ uncertainty by 1.34 km/s/Mpc compared to the O4-like configuration. The $H_0$ precision increases to approximately 6% when it is assumed that every galaxy has an equal probability of being the host.",

Our analysis reveals that adding a Gaussian bump to the initial curvature power spectrum at small scales enhances the abundance of massive halos while sharply reducing the number of small-mass halos, and consequently, satellite galaxies. Moreover, this modification increases the frequency of major mergers while suppressing high-mass-ratio minor mergers. These features may offer resolutions to the missing satellite and Too Big to Fail (TBTF) problems. In underdense regions -voids- the same modifications increase the likelihood of finding massive halos embedded in voids while similarly decreasing the small-halo population, and consequently, faint galaxies. This behavior suggests a potential solution to the void phenomenon, in which embedded halos, despite being too massive, were too rare to be noticed. More precisely, our results indicate that an excess of massive structures emerges at mass scales near the center of the Gaussian bump: $k_* = 1.85 \\,\\rm{h/Mpc}$ and $k_* = 3.95 \\,\\rm{h/Mpc}$. These scales correspond to mass scales of $M_* = 10^{11}$ and $M_* = 10^{10}$, respectively. This modification extends up to two orders of magnitude in higher mass scales, while reducing the abundance of halos below $M_*$ by two to three orders of magnitude. Additionally, we find that evolutionary conditions, halo-in-halo, and particularly halo-in-void statistics serve as more sensitive and complementary probes for differentiating among cosmological models.",

By combining WL measurements with data from external tracers of the gas around massive structures, it is possible to calibrate baryonic effects and, therefore, obtain more precise cosmological constraints. In this study, we generate mock data for a Stage-IV weak lensing survey such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), X-ray gas fractions, and stacked kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) measurements, to jointly constrain cosmological and astrophysical parameters describing baryonic effects (using the Baryon Correction Model - BCM). First, using WL data alone, we quantify the level to which the BCM parameters will need to be constrained to recover the cosmological constraints obtained under the assumption of perfect knowledge of baryonic feedback. We identify the most relevant baryonic parameters and determine that they must be calibrated to a precision of $\\sim 10$-$20\\%$ to avoid significant degradation of the fiducial WL constraints. We forecast that long-term X-ray data from $\\sim 5000$ clusters should be able to reach this threshold for the parameters that characterise the abundance of hot virialised gas.

For ground-based experiments with the antenna above the soil it is critical to characterize the effect from the soil on the sky observations. This characterization requires estimating the soil's electrical conductivity and relative permittivity in the same frequency range as the observations. Here we present our initial effort to estimate the conductivity and relative permittivity of the soil using the impedance of an antenna mounted at a distance above the surface. In this technique, the antenna used for soil characterization is the same as the antenna used for sky observations. To demonstrate the technique we use the antenna of the MIST global $21$~cm experiment. We measured the antenna impedance at three sites in the Greater Concepción area, Chile. The measurements were done between $25$ and $125$~MHz, matching the range used by MIST for sky observations. The soil parameters were estimated by fitting the impedance measurements with electromagnetic simulations of the antenna and soil. In this initial effort the soil was modeled as homogeneous. The conductivity at the three sites was found to be between $0.007$ and $0.049$~Sm$^{-1}$, and the relative permittivity between $1.6$ and $12.7$. The percent precision of the estimates at $68\\%$ probability is, with one exception, better (lower) than $33\\%$. The best-fit simulations have a better than $10\\%$ agreement with the measurements relative to the peak values of the resistance and reactance across our frequency range. For MIST, these results represent a successful proof of concept of the use of the antenna impedance for soil characterization, and are expected to significantly improve in future implementations.",

Submitted to MNRAS. Comments are welcomed Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present a theoretical framework for seeding and growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in dark matter halos along their assembly histories. Seeds are bred out of Pop-III stars formed during the first collapse of pristine gas in mini-halos that have reached the ${\\rm H}_2$-cooling limit, modulated by UV radiation from star formation and dynamical heating from fast halo assembly. Such breeding persists until the enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM) enables Pop-II stars to form. Post-seeding growth of black holes (BHs) is driven by distinct channels, starting with episodic super-Eddington accretion associated with nuclear bursts induced by global disturbances of galaxies, followed by sustained sub-Eddington accretion via capturing sub-clouds formed in self-gravitating gas clouds (SGCs) in halos of fast assembly, and ending with merger-dominated, quiescent growth. We implement the model in subhalo merger trees to build a coherent framework to follow the SMBH-galaxy-halo co-evolution over their full lives in the full structure hierarchy. BH seeds are bred with a broad mass spectrum of $M_{\\rm BH} = 10$--$10^5\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$ at $z \\approx 20$--$30$ in mini-halos with masses of $10^5$--$10^8\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$. Nuclear bursts provide the key condition for seeds to grow into SMBHs. The $M_{\\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation is a multi-piece, redshift-dependent function shaped by the interplay among different growth channels. Our model predictions are broadly consistent with existing observations; especially, a population of BHs reminiscent of 'little red dots' (LRDs) discovered by JWST naturally results from the seeding and growing processes. Potential future tests of the model are discussed.",

Davis, Yan-Fei Jiang, Christopher J. White 37 pages, 25 figures, 3 tables, submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a comprehensive analysis of super-Eddington black hole accretion simulations that solve the GRMHD equations coupled with angle-discretized radiation transport. The simulations span a range of accretion rates, two black hole spins, and two magnetic field topologies, and include resolution studies as well as comparisons with non-radiative models. Super-Eddington accretion flows consistently develop geometrically thick disks supported by radiation pressure, regardless of magnetic field configuration. Radiation generated in the inner disk drives substantial outflows, forming conical funnel regions that limit photon escape and result in very low radiation efficiency. The accretion flows are highly turbulent with thermal energy transport dominated by radiation advection rather than diffusion. Angular momentum is primarily carried outward by Maxwell stress, with turbulent Reynolds stress playing a subdominant role. Both strong and weak jets are produced. Strong jets arise from sufficient net vertical magnetic flux and rapid black hole spin and can effectively evacuate the funnel, enabling radiation to escape through strong geometric beaming. In contrast, weak jets fail to clear the funnel, which becomes obscured by radiation-driven outflows and leads to distinct observational signatures. Spiral structures are observed in the plunging region, behaving like density waves. These super-Eddington models are applicable to a variety of astronomical systems, including ultraluminous X-ray sources, little red dots, and black hole transients.",

Stars that form in or are captured by AGN disks will grow and migrate inward, potentially exploding as supernovae once the inner cold accretion disk disappears during the phase of AGN decay. We propose that tidal disruption of a supernova (TDS) by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) can produce nuclear transients that are even more luminous than typical TDEs and are not limited by the SMBH mass. In this scenario, the SMBH can capture the supernova ejecta, which subsequently self-intersects and circularizes into an accretion disk. Based on hydrodynamical simulations, we find that the accretion rate of the TDS disk exhibits a slow decline that can last for months to decades. The peak accretion rate of a typical core-collapse SN scenario can exceed the Eddington limit for SMBHs with $M_{\\rm BH} \\lesssim 10^{7.5}\\,M_\\odot$, while it remains sub-Eddington for more massive SMBHs. This model provides a mechanism for triggering an energetic TDE-like flare with luminosity \\(\\gtrsim10^{45}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}\\) in galaxies with $M_{\\rm BH}\\gtrsim10^{8}\\,M_\\odot$ or triggering turn-on changing-look AGNs.",

In this work, we analyze a sample of 163 long-duration GRBs detected by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE), applying detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to derive the Hurst index as a quantitative descriptor of temporal correlations in the light curves. We further explore statistical correlations between the Hurst index and 12 other observational parameters through regression and correlation analyses. Our results reveal anti-correlations between the Hurst index and the burst durations (T50, T90), and a negative trend with the low-energy spectral index \\alpha. We also find that correlations with peak photon flux are strongest at the shorter timescale (64 ms) and systematically weaken at longer timescales (256-1024 ms), indicating that the persistence of temporal correlations is most evident in the rapid variability component of GRB emission. The results offer new perspectives on the temporal structure of the GRB emission and its potential link to the underlying physical mechanisms driving these bursts.",

Mushtukov, Matthew Middleton accepted for publication in MNRAS but comments are welcome, 10 pages, 8 figures High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) It is anticipated that mass accretion rates exceeding approximately $10^{19}\\,{\\rm g\\,s^{-1}}$ in X-ray pulsars lead to radiation-driven outflows from super-critical accretion discs. The outflows launched from the disc influence the angular distribution of X-ray radiation, resulting in geometrical beaming. The beaming, in turn, impacts the apparent luminosity of the X-ray pulsar, detectability of pulsations, and the spectral composition of the X-ray flux. We employ a straightforward geometrical model of the outflows, perform Monte Carlo simulations, and model the spectra of radiation, reprocessed by the walls of the accretion cavity formed by the outflows. We consider the reprocessed emission only; direct pulsar emission is not included in our modelling. Our results demonstrate that the spectra of reprocessed radiation depend on the actual luminosity of the central engine, the geometry of the outflows, and the viewing angle - most notably on the latter, through changing visibility of the hotter wall regions near the disc plane. The high-energy part of the reprocessed spectrum depends strongly on viewing angle (harder at lower inclinations), while the soft flux varies comparatively little with inclination. In our model, this contrast is a prediction: variable ultra-luminous X-ray sources are expected to exhibit strong high-energy angle sensitivity together with comparatively modest soft-band variation, naturally arising if precession modulates the effective inclination.",

Using the $\\mathtt{startrack}$ and COSMIC population synthesis codes, we investigate how different supernova mechanisms affect the observable population of SL systems, with particular attention to the mass gap (2$\\mathrm{-}$5 M$_\\odot$) in compact object distributions. We test three supernova remnant formation models with different convective growth timescales ($f_{\\rm mix}$ = 0.5, 1.0, and 4.0), simulating SL binary systems across the Galactic disk and bulge. We identify distinct groupings of SL sources based on lens mass and Einstein crossing time, clearly differentiating neutron star from black hole systems and close from wide orbits. Notably, the delayed $f_{\\rm mix} = 0.5$ model predicts a significantly higher fraction of systems with lens masses in the mass gap region (up to $\\sim10$ times more for certain surveys), suggesting that SL observations could help constrain this controversial population. Our analysis reveals a strong preference for systems with low centre-of-mass velocities ($v_{\\rm cm}\\leq20$ km/s) across all models, resulting primarily from physical processes governing compact object formation and binary survival. While many potential detections will have limited observational coverage, ZTF is predicted to yield several dozen well-covered systems that should enable detailed characterization. When applying simple detection criteria including photometric precision and signal-to-noise requirements, predicted rates decrease by approximately two orders of magnitude, but still yield up to a few tens of expected detections for LSST and ZTF in the Galactic disk population.",

In this work, for the first time, we used the archival data and employed the physics-determined SED processing method to form approximately average-state SEDs for 513 \\textit{Fermi} bright BL Lacs. In general, we found that the magnetic field ($B$) is weaker than those obtained for flaring/outburst state by nearly one order of magnitude, and the dissipation region size ($R$) is larger than those obtained for flaring/outburst state, suggesting that the dissipation region could be more extend and less magnetized.

Using $\\gamma$-ray, X-ray, optical/UV, and infrared data assembled from the Markarian Multiwavelength Data Center, we constructed multi-band light curves and temporally resolved spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of PKS 2155-304 to probe the origin of its emission. The light curves show significant variability, with fractional variability peaking at 0.75 in X-rays, 0.4 in the optical/UV, and 0.65 in $\\gamma$-ray band-consistent with expectations for HSPs. Segmenting the $\\gamma$-ray light curve with Bayesian blocks, we defined 253 time-resolved epochs with adequate multi-band coverage and categorized them into quiescent states (QS), multiwavelength flares (MWF), $\\gamma$-ray flares ($\\gamma$F), X-ray flares (XF), and optical/UV flares (OUF). Each SED is modeled within a synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) framework that self-consistently evolves particle injection and cooling; a neural-network surrogate is used to accelerate parameter inference. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests reveal state-dependent parameter variations relative to QS: (i) during MWF, the magnetic field B, electron luminosity $L_{e}$, maximum electron Lorentz factor $\\gamma_{max}$, and Doppler factor $\\delta$ differ significantly; (ii) during $\\gamma$F, a harder electron index p is estimated; (iii) XF shows higher B and $\\gamma_{max}$ with a more compact emitting region; and (IV) during OUF, changes in B, $L_{e}$, $\\gamma_{max}$, $\\delta$, and p are found while the emitting-zone size remains approximately constant. The jet power is electron-dominated (magnetic-to-electron power ratio $\\eta_{B}\\simeq0.09-0.17$), with $\\eta_{B}$ rising during XF.

We compared trends in width evolution and emission height with a fan beam model. Results. Similar to other recent studies, we find that while many pulsars show profiles narrowing with increasing frequency, a substan- tial fraction show the reverse. The Gaussian decomposition of the profiles reveals that the peak locations of the components vary little with frequency. However, the component widths do, in general, narrow with increasing frequency. This argues that propagation effects are responsible for the width evolution of the profiles rather than emission height. Overall, the evolution of the emission height with frequency is unclear, and clouded by the assumptions in the model. Spin-down luminosity correlates weakly with profile narrowing but not with emission height. Conclusions. The classic picture where pulsars emit at a single emission height which decreases with increasing observing frequency cannot explain the diversity in behavior observed here. Instead, pulsar beams likely originate from extended regions at multiple altitudes, with fan-beam or patchy structures dominating their frequency evolution. Future models must incorporate realistic plasma physics and multi-altitude emission to capture the range of pulsar behaviors.",

Wollack 16 pages, 12 figures, submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Millimeter-wave observations of pulsars, while crucial for understanding their emission mechanisms, remain scarce. We demonstrate that high-precision cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments like the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), though designed for cosmology, offer a unique capability for such time-domain science due to their high cadence and broad sky coverage in millimeter bands. While previous ACT searches have focused on transients lasting minutes or longer, we develop and validate analysis methods to search for periodic, millisecond-scale transients, a capability not typically associated with CMB experiments. We describe a phase-resolved mapmaking approach, which leverages the known periodicity of the signal to enhance sensitivity and offers advantages in diagnosing systematic errors. We also introduce a template-based fit to the raw data timestreams that independently validate our results. Applying these methods to estimate the millimeter flux of the Crab Pulsar (PSR B0531+21), we derive 95% confidence upper limits of 4.6 mJy, 4.4 mJy, and 20.7 mJy on the pulsar's period-averaged flux density at 96 GHz, 148 GHz, and 225 GHz, respectively. These constraints fill a gap in our knowledge of the Crab Pulsar's spectral energy distribution, suggesting that it does not significantly flatten or invert at millimeter wavelengths. This work demonstrates the potential for future searches of short-timescale astrophysical phenomena with the next-generation CMB experiments like the Simons Observatory.",

      "abstract": "Discovery of femto Gauss intergalactic magnetic fields towards Mkn 501 Matías Sotomayor Webar, Yosef Abed, Dieter Horns High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The existence of intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMF) has so far not been established through observations. The IGMF is expected to be generated either via processes mainly connected to astrophysical processes or it could be a relic of phase transitions in the early universe. Upper bounds to the average field present are set via observations of Faraday rotation measure. Lower bounds have been derived from the non-detection of secondary gamma-rays possibly produced in electromagnetic cascades. We investigate the presence of IGMFs by studying the GeV gamma-ray emission from the nearby blazar Mkn~501 ($z=0.034$), searching for evidence of the extended halo expected to be observed around the point source. We analyse 14 years of data from Fermi-LAT and Swift-XRT/BAT to construct a time-average synchrotron-self Compton model for the TeV spectrum of Mkn~501. This injection spectrum is used to simulate the resulting cascade emission with the ELMAG code for different magnetic field and coherence length configurations. These templates are fit to the Fermi-LAT data to find a best-fitting model for the cascade emission. We find significant ($\\ge 5 \\sigma$ trial-corrected) evidence for extended secondary emission around Mkn~501, which is consistent with an IGMF with $B_\\mathrm{rms}=1.5_{-0.6}^{+1.6}\\times 10^{-15}~\\mathrm{G}$ and a coherence length of $\\ell_C=(10\\pm 3)~\\mathrm{kpc}$. The source needs to actively inject TeV gamma-rays for at least 45000 years to match the level of secondary emission. Our results indicate that the secondary gamma-rays are significantly present in the $\\it{Fermi}$-LAT data. The effect of plasma-heating by pairs in the cascade appears to be negligible for Mkn 501. This is consistent with the observation that Mkn~501 is one of the objects with the lowest injection power among the blazars studied in the context of cascade emission.",

Our analysis shows that flares are present in some observations, whereas they are absent in others. Flaring state exhibits two-component spectra at a lower average flux level, whereas the non-flaring state displays single-component spectra at a higher average flux level. The M74 X-1 spectra are best described by the combination of accretion disk and Comptonization components, a dual thermal disk blackbody model, and a modified multi-temperature disk blackbody model. Using the dual thermal disk blackbody model, we obtain cool and hot temperatures of $T_{in}$ (cool) = $0.38^{+0.08}_{-0.06}$ keV and $T_{in}$ (hot) = $1.67^{+0.18}_{-0.13}$ keV, respectively, suggesting two temperature emitting regions and indicating possible presence of outflowing wind along with the accretion disk. We found a Gaussian feature at $E_{line}$ = $0.96^{+0.05}_{-0.11}$ keV with $\\sigma$ = $0.11^{+0.13}_{-0.06}$ keV in the spectra of the flaring state which can be interpreted as the unresolved wind feature in the system when compared to similar feature seen in other ULXs. Plotting the hardness luminosity diagram, we get a trend of increasing hardness with luminosity, suggesting the presence of geometrical beaming in a low-inclination system. Additionally, using the hot disk blackbody component from the dual thermal disk blackbody model, we estimate the mass of the compact object to be M = $7.1^{+1.4}_{-1.3}$ M$_\\odot$, classifying it as a stellar-mass black hole and confirming super-Eddington accretion in the system.",

Our study incorporates 26 data points across ultraviolet to near-infrared, sourced from published literature, unpublished data, and new observations. In addition, archival XMM-Newton spectra were used to represent the X-ray emission. Care was taken to use out-of-eclipse flux measurements when the irradiated side of the companion faces the observer. The SED model includes contributions from a central source, a reprocessed accretion disk, and an irradiated companion star atmosphere, resulting in a good match to the observed fluxes. The revised and new parameters for the disk and the central source align with previous studies and match expectations for such systems. The temperature of the irradiated side of the companion star was estimated based on its B-V colour during the secondary eclipse.

      "abstract": "Combining PIC and MHD to model particle acceleration in astrophysical shocks Allard Jan van Marle Part of the conference proceedings of Stanfest 2024 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) When supersonic plasma flows collide, many physical processes contribute to the morphology of the resulting shock. One of these processes is the acceleration of non-thermal ions, which will, eventually, reach relativistic speeds and become cosmic rays. This process is difficult to simulate in a computer model because it requires both macro-physics (the overall shape of the shock) and micro-physics (the interaction between individual particles and the magnetic field). The combined PIC-MHD method is one of several options to get around this problem. It is based on the assumption that a plasma can be described as a combination of a thermal gas, which can be accurately described as a fluid using grid-based magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and a small non-thermal component which has to be described as individual particles using particle-in-cell (PIC). By combining aspects of both methods, we reduce the computational costs while maintaining the ability to trace the acceleration of individual particles. We apply this method to a variety of astrophysical shock configurations to investigate if, and how, they can contribute to the cosmic ray spectrum.",

We measure the expansion of the forward shock in the bright southern rim to be $0.\\!^{\\prime\\prime}10 \\pm 0.\\!^{\\prime\\prime}02$ over the $\\sim14.5$ yr baseline, which corresponds to a velocity of $1620\\pm400~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$ after accounting for several instrumental effects. We measure an expansion of $0.\\!^{\\prime\\prime}23 \\pm 0.\\!^{\\prime\\prime}02$ and a shock velocity of $3840\\pm260~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$ for two features in an apparent blowout region in the northeast. The emission-measure-weighted average temperature inferred from X-ray spectral fits to regions in the southern rim is $0.95\\pm0.17$ keV, consistent with the electron temperature implied by the shock velocity after accounting for Coulomb equilibration and adiabatic expansion. In contrast, the emission-measure-weighted average temperature for the northeast region is $0.77\\pm0.04$ keV, which is significantly lower than the value inferred from the shock velocity. We fit 1-D evolutionary models for the shock in the southern rim and northeast region, using the measured radius and propagation velocity into a constant density and power-law profile circumstellar medium. We find good agreement with the age of $\\sim2500$ years derived from optical expansion measurements for explosion energies of $1.5-3.0 \\times 10^{51}\\,\\mathrm{erg}$, ejecta masses of $2-6 \\,\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ and ambient medium densities of $\\sim0.33-0.66$ $\\mathrm{amu~cm}^{-3}$ in the south and $\\sim0.01-0.02$ $\\mathrm{amu~cm}^{-3}$ in the northeast assuming a constant density medium.

Hogg, Hans-Walter Rix 16 pages, 3 figures, submitted to OJAp Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Periodic variability in active galactic nuclei (AGN) light curves has been proposed as a signature of close supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. Recently, 181 candidate SMBH binaries were identified in Gaia DR3 based on periodicity in their $\\sim$1000-day light curves. By supplementing Gaia photometry with longer-baseline light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Catalina Real Time Transient Survey (CRTS), we test whether the reported periodic signals persist beyond the Gaia DR3 time window. We find that in all 116 cases with available ZTF data, the Gaia-inferred periodic model fails to predict subsequent variability, which appears stochastic rather than periodic. The periodic candidates thus overwhelmingly appear to be false positives; red noise contamination appears to be the primary source of false detections. We conclude that truly periodic AGN are exceedingly rare, with at most a few in $10^6$ AGN exhibiting stable periodicity on 100 to 1000 day timescales. Models predict that the Gaia AGN light curve sample should contain dozens of true SMBH binaries with periods within the observational baseline, so the lack of strictly periodic light curves in the sample suggests that most short-period binary AGN do not have light curves dominated by simple periodicity.",

With at least one black hole (BH) in the upper-mass gap and both BHs exhibiting high spins ($\\chi_{1,2} \\gtrsim 0.8$), this event challenges standard isolated binary evolution models. A compelling alternative is a dynamical origin in star clusters, where stellar binaries and hierarchical mergers may both contribute to the formation of similar BBHs. In this work, we investigate the formation of GW231123-like events in different cluster environments using the B-POP semi-analytic population synthesis code. We find that low-metallicity environments ($Z \\lesssim 0.002$) are ideal for producing BBH mergers similar to GW231123. In young and globular clusters, these BBHs have components formed in stellar binaries, whilst in nuclear clusters there is also a significant contribution from BHs built-up via hierarchical mergers. Natal spins of BHs formed in stellar binaries are crucial to find GW231123 analogs. In particular, our models suggest that BHs from stellar binaries are likely characterized by high-spins. Simulated GW231123-like systems exhibit short delay times, $t_\\mathrm{del} \\sim 0.1 - 1$ Gyr, which suggests their progenitors formed close to the inferred merger redshift ($z = 0.39^{+0.27}_{-0.24}$). We argue that star clusters in metal-poor dwarf galaxies or Milky Way-like galaxies are ideal nurseries, inferring an upper limit to the local merger rate of $\\mathcal{R} \\sim 1.6\\times10^{-3} - 0.16$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ for nuclear clusters, $\\sim 0.036 - 0.72$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ for globular clusters, and $4\\times10^{-4}-0.041$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ for young clusters.",

The identification was performed by taking advantage of a set of images acquired with the Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys in the optical band, and with the Gemini South Telescope in the near-infrared. The analysis of these images revealed the presence of a star with a position possibly compatible with the X-ray and radio band coordinates of the Rapid Burster, and showing significant optical variability. According to its location in the color-magnitude diagram, the candidate companion appears to belong to the young (~ 1-2 Gyr old) super-solar metallicity ([M/H]= +0.3) sub-population recently discovered in Liller 1.

Here, we show that, after the Moon reached synchronous rotation, Earthshine could induce global circulation in lunar magma ocean due to the imposed surface temperature gradient generated by the hot, post-giant impact Earth. The global circulation, generating downwellings on the farside and a deeper return flow on the nearside, results that magmas flow from the nearside to the farside in the shallow magma ocean while the the direction of flow is opposite in the deep magma ocean. Such flow in the shallow magma ocean would transport anorthositic crystals formed in the nearside to the farside. Furthermore, since the lunar farside is cooler than the nearside, crystallization is much more efficient at the farside, resulting that farside magmas transported from the nearside produce anorthositic crystals rapidly. The theory proposed here may provide a natural way of explaining the origin of the lunar farside highlands.",

Stolyarov Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Computing Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a technique to search for fast radio bursts in records obtained with broadband radiometers having few radio channels. The technique is applied to the RATAN-600 surveys carried out at its Western Sector since the year 2017. A 1D convolutional neural network for multichannel time series classification is developed based on the EfficientNet family of models. The procedure to generate synthetic FRB signals needed for the training dataset is described. We implement a two-stage cascade scheme to effectively suppress the rate of false positive detections. Evaluation of the trained model is provided based on the synthetic events and the giant pulse of the Crab Pulsar.",

We report the first observation of fully-developed shocks ($R=4$ compression ratio and a downstream region decoupled from the piston) after seven upstream ion gyration periods. A foot ahead of the shock exhibits super-adiabatic electron and ion heating. We measure the electron temperature $T_e = 115$ eV and ion temperature $T_i = 15$ eV upstream of the shock; whereas, downstream, we measure $T_e=390$ eV and infer $T_i=340$ eV, consistent with both Thomson scattering ion-acoustic wave spectral broadening and Rankine-Hugoniot conditions. The downstream electron temperature has a $30$-percent excess from adiabatic and collisional electron-ion heating, implying significant collisionless anomalous electron heating. Furthermore, downstream electrons and ions are in equipartition, with a unity electron-ion temperature ratio $T_e/T_i = 1.2$.",

Torres-Albà High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The spectroscopic redshift measurement of BL Lac, a class of blazar, is challenging because its spectrum has no or weak emission lines ($\\leqslant5$Å). We estimate the redshift by the photometric dropout technique for a sample of 64 blazars (59 BL Lacs and five blazar candidates of uncertainty type). Two telescopes are utilized to observe the sample: the {\\it Swift} space telescope observes sources in $uvw2,\\ uvm2,\\ uvw1,\\ u,\\ b,\\ v$ filters, while the ground-based telescopes SARA-CT/RM observed sources in $g',\\ r,' \\ i',\\ z'$ filters. The photometric data are obtained using the {\\it photozpy} package. We fit the photometric data by the LePhare package and report four new high-$z$ ($z>1.3$) BL Lacs at $2.03^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$, $1.84^{+0.10}_{-0.03}$, $2.04^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$, $2.93^{+0.01}_{-0.04}$ as well as upper limits for 50 sources. The work increased the number of high-$z$ BL Lacs found by this method up to 23. The high-$z$ sources are discussed in the context of the cosmic gamma-ray horizon, blazar sequence, Fermi blazar divide, and masquerading BL Lacs.",

Villante Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics, Volume 2025, September 2025 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Recently, the Large High-Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) collaboration has obtained a measurement of the gamma-ray diffuse emission in the ultra-high energy range, $10-10^3$ TeV after masking the contribution of known sources. The measurement is provided in two Galactic regions and appears to be 2-3 times higher than the gamma-ray signal expected from the hadronic interactions of diffuse cosmic rays with the interstellar medium, potentially implying that either additional emission sources exist or cosmic ray intensities have spatial variations. In this work, we calculate the hadronic gamma-ray diffuse emission outside the masks, considering a realistic gas distribution. We present a comprehensive calculation of the emission, which includes systematic uncertainties in the gas content of the Galactic disk, in the energy and spatial distribution of cosmic rays, as well as in the hadronic interaction cross-sections. Our results show that these factors mitigate the tension between data and predictions. The LHAASO data appear compatible with our baseline model in the outer Galactic region. In the inner region, the data show an excess with respect to the predictions below $\\sim 50$ TeV, while at higher energies they are well described by our model. We argue that two plausible explanations for enhanced gamma-ray emission-unresolved sources and CR spectral hardening in the inner Galaxy-are likely suppressed by the LHAASO masking strategy, which excludes regions where both effects are expected to be most prominent.",

More and more analyses show that (at least a fraction of) QPEs are the result of collisions between a stellar mass object (SMO, a stellar mass black hole or a main sequence star) and an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. Previous studies have shown the possibility of reconstructing the SMO trajectory from QPE timing data, consequently measuring the SMBH mass from tracing a single SMO. In this paper, we construct a comprehensive Bayesian framework for implementing the QPE timing method, explore the optimal QPE observation strategy for measuring SMBH masses, and forecast the measurement precision expected in the era of multi-target X-ray telescope, Chasing All Transients Constellation Hunters (CATCH). Simulations of CATCH observations of GSN 069 and eRO-QPE2 like QPEs confirm the possible applications of the QPE timing method in precise measurement of SMBH masses (and spins), especially in the lower mass end ($\\lesssim 10^7 M_\\odot$) where QPEs prevail and relevant dynamical timescales are reasonably short to be measured.",

Davis, Yan-Fei Jiang, Christopher J. White 27 pages, 13 figures, 1 table, submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We summarize results from a survey of radiation-dominated black hole accretion flows across a wide range of mass accretion rates, as well as two values of black hole spin and initial magnetic field geometry. These models apply an algorithm targeting direct solutions to the radiation transport equation in full general relativity and have been enabled by access to modern exascale computing systems. Super-Eddington accretion flows form geometrically thick radiation pressure supported disks that drive powerful equatorial outflows. A narrow funnel-shaped photosphere in the inner region results in very low radiative efficiencies in this regime. The structure of near- and sub-Eddington accretion depends on whether there is net vertical magnetic flux at the midplane of the disk. With net flux, the disk forms a thin, dense layer at the midplane surrounded by a magnetically-dominated corona, whereas without net flux the disk remains magnetically dominated everywhere. Although none of our models achieve the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) regime, those with net vertical flux and a rapidly spinning black hole still produce powerful relativistic jets. Our calculations adopt simple opacity models (with scalings appropriate to stellar-mass black hole accretion). We discuss the application of our results to observations of X-ray binaries and ultraluminous X-ray sources such as Cyg X-3 and SS433. We also speculate on the application of our super-Eddington models to the interpretation of little red dots (LRDs) recently discovered by JWST.",

We find that the star-disk collision produces ejecta on both sides of the disk. As the ejecta expand and cool, transient flares arise, reaching peak bolometric luminosity of up to $L\\gtrsim10^{43}\\rm erg~s^{-1}$. We estimate that the typical light curve rises and decays on an hour timescale. The spectral energy distribution (SED) peaks in $20-50$eV. The optical depth in soft X-rays is lower than the frequency-integrated optical depth, yielding $100$eV-$1$KeV luminosity $\\nu L_{\\nu}\\gtrsim10^{42}\\rm erg~s^{-1}$. The ejecta aligned with the star's incident direction shows breakout emission, leading to asymmetric SED evolution of the two ejecta. The SED evolution is roughly consistent with those seen in short-period quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), which have eruption duration ranging from sub-hour to hours, but the ejecta cooling emission alone may not be sufficient to explain the longer duration flares. Increasing incident velocity generally produces a brighter and harder flare. A larger disk scale height prolongs the breakout emission but leads to a somewhat softer SED. A higher disk surface density can lead to higher ejecta temperature, reducing bound-free opacity and increasing luminosity. When lowering the disk surface density, we find that the ejecta becomes optically thin when the scattering optical depth across disk is at the order of $\\tau_{\\rm disk}\\sim200$, and the ejecta disappear when $\\tau_{\\rm disk}\\sim10$.",

We present the broadband X-ray timing and spectral behaviors of SRGA J144459.2$-$604207 during its 2024 outburst. The data were collected from NICER, Einstein Probe, IXPE, Insight-HXMT, NuSTAR and INTEGRAL observations. X-ray pulsations have been detected for the 1.5--90 keV energy range throughout the `ON' phase of the outburst from MJD $\\sim 60355-60385$. We refined the orbital and spin ephemerides assuming a circular orbit, and found that the pulsar was in a spin-up state during MJD $\\sim$ 60361--60377 showing a significant spin-up rate $\\dot{\\nu}$ of $(3.15\\pm 0.36)\\times10^{-13}~{\\rm Hz~s^{-1}}$. Around MJD $\\sim 60377$ a swing was detected in the spin evolution accompanied by significantly enhanced pulsed emission. We studied the pulse profile morphology during the X-ray bursts as observed by Insight-HXMT, IXPE and NuSTAR. During the bursts, pulsations were detected across the 2--60 keV with shapes broadly consistent with those observed for the persistent emission. We found, however, that the `burst' pulse profiles exhibit significant phase offsets relative to the pre- and post-burst profiles. These offsets systematically decrease with increasing energy, $\\Delta \\phi\\approx0.15$, 0.11 and 0.02 for IXPE, Insight-HXMT ME and HE in 2--8, 5--30 and 20--60 keV, respectively, and $\\Delta \\phi \\approx 0.21$, 0.10 and 0.07 for NuSTAR in 3--10, 20--35 and 35--60 keV, respectively, compared to the pre- and post-burst profiles. We performed a joint spectral analysis of quasi-simultaneous NICER, NuSTAR, and Insight-HXMT data for two epochs. The resulting spectra from both observations were consistent and well-described by an absorbed thermal Comptonization model, nthcomp, plus relativistic reflection, relxillCp.",

We have successfully achieved this using ultra-relativistic protons accelerated by the Super Proton Synchrotron at CERN. In the first application of this experimental platform, the stability of the pair beam is studied as it propagates through a metre-length plasma, analogous to TeV $\\gamma$-ray induced pair cascades in the intergalactic medium. It has been argued that pair beam instabilities disrupt the cascade, thus accounting for the observed lack of reprocessed GeV emission from TeV blazars. If true this would remove the need for a moderate strength intergalactic magnetic field to explain the observations. We find that the pair beam instability is suppressed if the beam is not perfectly collimated or monochromatic, hence the lower limit to the intergalactic magnetic field inferred from $\\gamma$-ray observations of blazars is robust.",

Phys. 97, 035002 (2025) Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th) In stars that lie on the main sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram, like our sun, hydrogen is fused to helium in a number of nuclear reaction chains and series, such as the proton-proton chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycles. Precisely determined thermonuclear rates of these reactions lie at the foundation of the standard solar model. This review, the third decadal evaluation of the nuclear physics of hydrogen-burning stars, is motivated by the great advances made in recent years by solar neutrino observatories, putting experimental knowledge of the proton-proton chain neutrino fluxes in the few-percent precision range. The basis of the review is a one-week community meeting held in July 2022 in Berkeley, California, and many subsequent digital meetings and exchanges. The relevant reactions of solar and stellar hydrogen burning are reviewed here, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Recommendations for the state of the art of the astrophysical S-factor and its uncertainty are formulated for each of them. Several other topics of paramount importance for the solar model are reviewed, as well: recent and future neutrino experiments, electron screening, radiative opacities, and current and upcoming experimental facilities. In addition to reaction-specific recommendations, also general recommendations are formed.",

Beattie, Anne Noer Kolborg, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, Christoph Federrath Main text 26 pages, 14 figures. Appendix, 7 pages, 8 figures. Accepted in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The interstellar medium (ISM) of disk galaxies is turbulent, and yet the fundamental nature of ISM turbulence, the energy cascade, is not understood in detail. In this study, we use high-resolution simulations of a hydrodynamical, gravitationally stratified, supernova (SNe)-driven, multiphase ISM to probe the nature of a galactic turbulence cascade. Through the use of velocity flux transfer functions split into interactions between compressible $\\mathbf{u}_c$ and incompressible $\\mathbf{u}_s$ modes, we show that there exists a large-to-small-scale cascade in both $\\mathbf{u}_c$ and $\\mathbf{u}_s$ when mediated by an additional $\\mathbf{u}_s$ mode. But the $\\mathbf{u}_s$ cascade is highly non-local. Moreover, there is a $\\mathbf{u}_c$ mediated component of the $\\mathbf{u}_s$ cascade that proceeds in the opposite direction -- an inverse cascade from small-to-large scales. The cascade feeds flux into scales well beyond the scale height, energizing the winds and fueling the direct cascades. Both the strongly non-local and the inverse $\\mathbf{u}_s$ cascades happen on scales that have a power law $\\mathbf{u}_s$ energy spectrum, highlighting how degenerate the spectrum is to the true underlying physical processes. We directly show that the inverse cascade comes from $\\mathbf{u}_s$ modes interacting with expanding SNe remnants (SNRs) and that $\\mathbf{u}_s$ modes are generated to leading order via baroclinic, highly corrugated cooling layers between warm $(T\\lesssim 10^4\\,\\rm{K})$ and hot $(T\\gg10^4\\,\\rm{K})$ gas in these SNRs. Finally, we outline a complete phenomenology for SNe-driven turbulence in a galactic disk, estimate a $10^{-16}\\,\\rm{G}$ Biermann field generated from SNR cooling layers, and highlight the strong deviations that SNe-driven turbulence has from the conventional Kolmogorov model.",

To understand how ensemble-averaged transport behaviour emerges from the intricate interactions between cosmic rays and structured magnetic turbulence, we run test-particle experiments in snapshots of a strongly turbulent magnetohydrodynamics simulation. We characterize particle-turbulence interactions via the gyro radii of particles and their experienced field-line curvatures, which reveals two distinct transport modes: magnetized motion, where particles are tightly bound to strong coherent flux tubes and undergo large-scale mirroring; and unmagnetized motion characterized by chaotic scattering through weak and highly tangled regions of the magnetic field. We formulate an effective stochastic process for each mode: compound subdiffusion with long mean free paths for magnetized motion, and a Langevin process with short mean free paths for unmagnetized motion. A combined stochastic walker that alternates between these two modes accurately reproduces the mean squared displacements observed in the test-particle data. Our results emphasize the critical role of coherent magnetic structures in comprehensively understanding cosmic-ray transport and lay a foundation for developing a theory of geometry-mediated transport.",

In its planned 2027 launch, PBR will study Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays, Neutrinos, and High-Altitude Horizontal Airshowers from 33 km above the Earth. By operating at balloon altitudes, PBR will provide a novel vantage point to study air-shower physics while offering competitive instantaneous exposure to neutrinos from transient astrophysical phenomena. The payload's optical instrument is a 0.95 m$^2$ aperture hybrid Schmidt telescope with a 3.81 m$^2$ segmented mirror focusing light onto a Fluorescence Camera and a bi-focalized Cherenkov Camera. The payload will also feature a Radio Instrument consisting of two sinuous antennas based on the Payload for Ultrahigh Energy Observations (PUEO) low-frequency instrument. A combined gamma ray/x-ray detector and IR cloud camera round out the instrumentation package, meaning PBR will be the first multi-hybrid balloon-borne multi-messenger observatory flown. This extensive instrumentation must be combined into a radio quiet payload that satisfies the scientific needs and can operate in near vacuum at extreme temperatures, all while meeting NASA safety requirements and weighing no more than 3000 lbs (1361 kg). Accomplishing these tasks together will mark a significant step toward establishing technological readiness for the POEMMA satellite mission. We present an overview of PBR's mechanical and optical systems, additionally detailing our strategies to mitigate electromagnetic interference for the radio instrument and prepare for the harsh near-space environment.",

Their high density generally increases the suppression of star formation, known as quenching, altering galaxy properties. We study the quenching of emission-line galaxies (ELGs) in the rich cluster ZwCl 0024.0+1652 (Cl0024) at redshift $z\\sim0.4$, aiming to determine if and how star formation is suppressed. Using multi-object spectroscopy from the GLACE survey, we extracted fluxes and redshifts of [O II]$\\lambda\\lambda3727,3729$, $\\mathrm{H\\beta}$, and [O III]$\\lambda5007$ emission lines to derive star formation rates (SFRs) for 173 ELGs. We also performed spectral energy distribution fitting to obtain key evolutionary parameters such as stellar masses ($M_\\star$) and the 4000 Å break ($D4000$) index. We derived the $M_\\star-\\mathrm{SFR}$ relation for 98 star-forming galaxies (SFGs), finding 34.7% exhibit suppressed SFRs in the cluster, compared to 11.0% in the field. While the SFRs show no significant variation with local density, the fraction of SFGs is 1.55 times higher in the cluster outskirts than in intermediate-density regions. The specific SFR decreases strongly with $D4000$ for active SFGs but remains constant for suppressed galaxies. The fraction of suppressed galaxies in the infall region is 2.6 times higher than in the core, especially in the infalling structure B of the cluster. The cluster's total mass does not appear to be a key factor in SFG quenching. Star formation in Cl0024 galaxies is suppressed by the dense cluster environment. This suppression is evident in SFG fractions and parameters tracing long-term evolution, indicating prolonged quenching. The SFGs preferentially reside in low-density regions, while suppressed galaxies dominate the infall region, supporting a 'delayed-then-rapid' quenching scenario.",

The interaction between the black hole and their host profoundly shapes galactic evolution and the Universe as a whole. The key feature of this interaction are black hole jets - or more generally winds - which every black hole must have. Despite our Galaxy's central black hole, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), proximity and importance, the active wind from it has eluded scientists for over half a century. Here we report the discovery of a large active wind from Sgr A* using unprecedentedly deep observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). We detect a large conical clearing in the cold molecular gas surrounding Sgr A* that is at least 1 parsec in length and has a 45-degree opening angle. The morphology and energetics of this structure are consistent with active clearing by a hot wind from Sgr A*. This finding resolves the long-standing mystery of the missing wind from Sgr A*, and delivers the most detailed look yet of black hole feeding and feedback processes in our Galactic center.",

The issue is edited by Matt Griffin and Naseem Rangwala (JATIS VOL. 11, NO. 3, July 2025) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope show that nearby spiral galaxies are dominated by the presence of H I and H II bubbles that strongly shape their surrounding medium. These bubbles result from the feedback of high-mass stars at different stages of their life cycle. However, early (pre-supernova) feedback from high-mass stars is still poorly quantified. Recent results from numerical simulations suggest that the impact of high-mass star early feedback (photoionization, wind) on star formation properties is complex, time-dependent, and strongly depends on physical conditions, including the magnetic field properties. In our Galaxy, ionized (H II) regions observed in different evolution stages show a high diversity of star formation in their associated photo-dissociation regions (PDRs). However, the way in which the low- to high-density interstellar medium evolves to this situation remains elusive. Quantifying the impact of early feedback from high-mass stars on star formation properties and star formation laws (star formation rate, star formation efficiency versus gas surface density, {\\Sigma}gas) will allow for a better understanding of the evolution of star formation laws in external galaxies, the laws that are key ingredients of galaxy evolution models. PRIMA, with its high sensitivity, large mapping efficiency, and polarimetric capabilities, offers a unique opportunity to address the way radiative feedback and magnetic field control star formation in the Milky Way.",

Blan Accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Rosette Nebula is a well-known H II region shaped by the interaction of gas with the OB stars of the NGC 2244 stellar association. Located within the remnant of a giant molecular cloud, it exhibits a complex structure of ionized gas, molecular material, dust, and embedded clusters. In October 2023, the region was observed as part of the SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper (LVM) integral field spectroscopy survey. Covering a radius of approximately 1 degree, the dataset comprises 33,326 spectra with spatially resolved information spanning 390 - 980 nm. We present a structural analysis of the ionized, molecular, and dusty components using multi-wavelength observations: optical spectroscopy from SDSS-V LVM, 12CO emission from PMO/MWISP (sub-millimeter), and dust emission from WISE (12 micron) and Herschel (far-infrared). These datasets were complemented with the positions of ionizing stars to study emission structures traced by H alpha, H beta, [O III], [N II], and [S II], as well as the spatial distribution of line ratios (H alpha/H beta, [O III]/H beta, [N II]/H alpha, and [S II]/H alpha) relative to the surrounding molecular cloud. Our analysis reveals interaction zones between ionized and neutral gas, including filaments, globules, and dense regions with or without ongoing star formation. Radial and quadrant-based flux profiles further highlight morphological and ionization variations, supporting the scenario in which the Rosette Nebula evolved from a non-homogeneous molecular cloud with a thin, sheet-like structure.",

Submitted to ApJL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) When black hole jets encounter ambient medium, they can compress the gas, trigger star formation, and create stellar clusters containing tens of thousands of stars. Here, we report a remarkable discovery of such a phenomenon that happened just 2.2 billion years after the Big Bang, during the Cosmic Noon era. Quasar SDSSJ141924.44+532315.5, powered by a one-billion-solar-mass black hole, is seen blasting a powerful jet that interacts with a hypermassive gas reservoir, creating a fascinating, clumpy, arc-like structure spanning over 250 kiloparsecs in projected length, consisting of at least eight clumps. Each clump contains billions of stars, is as massive as the Milky Way, and exhibits extreme levels of star formation. We interpret these findings as fragmentation of a cosmic filament triggered by a jet overpressurized expanding cocoon, which leads to the birth of protogalaxies, a process observed at scales never seen before. We find that the physical conditions within the filament are favorable for a fragmentation scenario to occur. We also discuss the survivability and evolution of individual clumps in the context of unsolved galaxy formation theory problems.",

      "abstract": "Using white dwarf lensing to resolve accretion flows Sophie L. Newman, Matthew J. Middleton, Adam McMaster Submitted to MNRAS. Comments are welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Microlensing is one of the most powerful tools for probing the nature of dark halo objects and the sources they lens. As our nearest massive galaxy, M31 provides a rich source population with many potential lenses in its halo crossing our field of view at any one time. In this paper we explore the probability that X-ray sources in M31 will be lensed by white dwarfs in M31's halo. We find an expected lensing rate of 2.6/year within the mean archival Swift XRT field-of-view, and 6.3/year for the whole galaxy. For X-ray emitting sources harboring accreting neutron stars and black holes, we find that microlensing offers a unique opportunity to constrain the properties of the inner accretion flow. Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to recover both the spin of the black hole and the temperature profile of the accretion disk by discerning their effects upon the profile of the microlensing magnification. We show that these parameters have a significant effect on the shape of the light curve, with the effect of spin being more pronounced at smaller impact parameters and higher energies, while the effect of the temperature profile is larger at lower energies and larger impact parameters. This suggests that multi-band observations of a single lensing event could be used to robustly constrain both parameters.",

Davis Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) In our previous paper, we developed an orbit-superposition method for edge-on barred galaxies, and constructed dynamical models based on different mock observations of three galaxies from the Auriga simulations. In this study, we adopt 12 cases with side-on bars (three simulated galaxies, each with four different projections). We decompose these galaxies into different structures combining the kinematic and morphological properties of stellar orbits, and compare the model-predicted components to their true counterparts in the simulations. Our models can identify (BP/X-shaped) bars, spheroidal bulges, thin disks, and spatially diffuse stellar halos. The mass fractions of bars and disks are well constrained with absolute biases $|f_{\\rm model}-f_{\\rm true}|\\le0.15$. The mass fractions of halos are recovered with $|f_{\\rm model}-f_{\\rm true}|\\le0.03$. For the bulge components, 10 of 12 cases have $|f_{\\rm model}-f_{\\rm true}|\\le0.05$, while the other two cases have $|f_{\\rm model}-f_{\\rm true}|\\le0.10$. Then, by tagging the stellar orbits with ages and metallicities, we derive the chemical properties of each structure. For stellar ages, our models recover the negative gradients in the bars and disks, but exhibit relatively larger uncertainties for age gradients in the bulges and halos. The mean stellar ages of all components are constrained with absolute biases $|t_{\\rm model}-t_{\\rm true}|\\rm\\lesssim1\\,Gyr$. For stellar metallicities, our models reproduce the steep negative gradients of the bars and bulges, and all different kinds of metallicity gradients in the disks and halos. Except for the bulge in the simulated galaxy Au-18, the mean stellar metallicities of all other components are constrained with absolute biases $|Z_{\\rm model}-Z_{\\rm true}|\\rm\\le0.5\\,Z_{\\odot}$.",

The resulting multiwavelength view of the Red Spider establishes the detailed lobe/torus structure of the nebula and the mass-loss history of its progenitor star. The extinction-penetrating JWST/NIRCam Br$\\alpha$ and PAH and ALMA 3 mm continuum imaging exposes the complexity of the ionized inner nebula. JWST/NIRCam H$_2$ imaging traces the full, $\\sim$1.1 pc extent of the bubble-like lobes formed by fast ($\\sim$300-400 km s$^{-1}$) polar outflows, while ALMA $^{13}$CO(1-0) mapping reveals a point-symmetric, slowly ($\\sim$10 km s$^{-1}$) expanding equatorial torus of radius $\\sim$0.13 pc. In striking contrast, the [Fe II] image displays an extended S-shaped emission morphology that traces collisions between an active, collimated wind and slower-moving material along the lobe rims. No X-rays are detected from the nebula or its central star in deep Chandra/HRC-I imaging. However, the combined HST and JWST imaging reveals a near-IR excess at the central star indicative of emission from hot ($\\sim$1000 K) circumstellar dust. We propose that interactions between the nebular progenitor star and a close companion are responsible for the ejection of NGC 6537's molecular torus, the formation of a circumbinary dust disk, and the launching of fast, wandering, collimated outflows that have inflated the polar lobe bubbles traced by near-IR H$_2$ emission and are presently generating the [Fe II]-emitting shocks.",

We measured proper motions (PMs) for six dwarf galaxies located 400-1000 kpc from the MW using the Hubble Space Telescope. For four galaxies (Aquarius, Cetus, Pisces, Tucana), we report the first PMs. For the remaining two (Leo T and Pegasus), we measure PMs with order-of-magnitude improvement. We compute orbital histories to assess whether any of the six are backsplash galaxies. While some have non-zero likelihoods of past interaction with the MW or M31, these are weak and typically occur at large distances (e.g., $>$ 2Rvir). The properties of Aquarius, Leo T, Pisces, and Pegasus are consistent with first passage through a massive halo. Cetus, which shows a low probability (~4-6%) of interacting with the MW or M31 in the last 6 Gyr, is more likely a backsplash galaxy resulting from an interaction with M31 over 6 Gyr ago, in the same regime where rigid orbital models become less reliable. Tucana has been thought to be a backsplash galaxy, but our orbits indicate it cannot have interacted with a massive LG host. Our results highlight the diversity of evolutionary pathways for isolated, intermediate-mass dwarfs ($M_* \\approx 10^5-10^7 M_{\\odot}$) and the need to reassess quenching mechanisms beyond environmental interactions with massive hosts.",

We calculate the thermal and non-thermal contributions to the $b$ values. Both $b$ and the thermal contribution to $b$ can be substantially less than the CIE value.

The ring-like structure is redshifted with respect to the clump, spanning from $V_{\\rm sys,lsr} + 0.9$ to $V_{\\rm sys,lsr} + 2.9$ km s$^{-1}$, with a total mass of 109 $M_{\\odot}$. It is spatially coincident with 1.3 mm and 3.0 mm dust continuum emission from cores, and several protostellar outflows. However, no free-free emission or H\\textsc{ii} region is detected in association with this structure. With a slow expansion speed indicated by the position-velocity diagram, this ring structure differs from rings previously identified in more evolved star-forming regions. Possible explanations for the ring-like structure include a relic wind-blown bubble produced by a deeply embedded young stellar object, a hollow cavity formed by cloud-cloud interactions, a gas ring resulting from a temperature gradient, or a line-of-sight superposition of multiple outflows or dense clouds.

Barbuy Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Scaling relations between galactic parameters represent key pieces of evidence for investigating the processes of galaxy formation and evolution. In most studies, these relations have been obtained for large portions of the galaxies (i.e., on kpc scales), but it is also important to evaluate these relations in smaller scales. In this work, we used optical data cubes of a subsample of nearby galaxies of the DIVING 3D survey. These allowed us to analyze the scaling relations involving stellar velocity dispersion, stellar population age, and stellar population metallicity at the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of galaxies. We detected correlations between the stellar velocity dispersion and the age, metallicity, and total stellar mass. These correlations are independent of galaxy inclinations, considering all morphological types, nuclear activity, and the presence or absence of galactic bars. We detected, for the first time, a correlation between the stellar velocity dispersion and stellar metallicity in the nuclear regions of galaxies. It is found to be qualitatively consistent with the well-known stellar mass-metallicity relation. We also noted that barred galaxies tend to show younger and less metal-rich stellar populations than unbarred galaxies in the central regions, which may be a consequence of the bar triggering star formation in the nuclear regions of these objects. Some active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in our sample are positioned above the observed correlation between stellar velocity dispersion and stellar population age, suggesting that their nuclear stellar populations are younger than expected. This may be a consequence of positive AGN feedback, triggering star formation. Conversely, starburst galaxies do not show nuclear stellar populations at ages over one billion years.",

ALMA CO and SiO trace both lobes of the bipolar jet, revealing high-velocity collimated jets and wider outflow components.

Shorter-wavelength MIRI H$_2$ rotational lines (S(7)-S(4)) trace compact jet structures resembling SiO emission, while longer-wavelength lines (S(3)-S(1)) reveal more extended emission akin to low-velocity CO. From H$_2$ rotational emission, we identify two molecular gas temperature components: warm $(\\sim 773 \\pm 44 K)$ and hot $(\\sim 2499\\pm720 K)$.

Accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) High-density molecular gas plays a vital role in supporting star formation within galaxies. However, traditional tracers of dense gas, such as the low-$J$ transitions of HCN and HCO$^+$, are predominantly optically thick. This characteristic presents a significant challenge in accurately estimating the column density of dense gas and mapping its spatial distribution. Optically-thin tracers, including HC$_3$N (10-9) and isotopologues of HCN, HCO$^+$, HNC (1-0), among others, emerge as better tracers, by enabling more precise measurements and analyses of the dense gas in galaxies. Here, we present the first high-resolution ($\\sim$3.8$''$, corresponding to $\\sim$65 pc) molecular line observations of the nearby starburst galaxy M~82 with IRAM Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA). Notably, HC$_3$N (10-9) and H$^{13}$CN (1-0) emission lines are brighter at the northeast part (NE lobe) than those at the southwest part (SW lobe) of M~82, suggesting a higher accumulation of dense gas at the NE lobe. The spatial distributions of H41$\\alpha$ and 3-mm continuum emission indicate that starburst activity varies across the central starburst disk, with more intense star formation occurring at the SW lobe compared to the NE lobe. The average optical depths of HCN and HCO$^+$ (1-0) across the triple-peaked regions exhibit significant variation, with the highest values observed at the NE lobe. Our results suggest a potential evolutionary sequence in M~82, where the distributions of star formation and dense gas appear to be partially decoupled -- a phenomenon that classical dense gas tracers cannot adequately probe.",

Walker Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We report JWST NIRCAM and MIRI observations of Sgr B2, the most active site of star formation in the Galaxy. These observations, using 14 filters spanning 1.5 to 25 microns, have revealed a multilayered and highly structured cloud that contains both a revealed, low-extinction and hidden, high-extinction population of massive stars. JWST has detected new candidate HII regions around massive stars previously missed by radio telescopes. MIRI has detected radiation escaping from the forming massive cluster Sgr B2 N along its outflow cavities, demonstrating that infrared radiation finds geometric escape routes even in the densest, most heavily embedded regions in the universe. JWST further highlights the gas asymmetry in the cloud, showing a sharp, straight cutoff along the eastern cloud edge. Despite the great sensitivity of these observations, no extended population of YSOs has been detected, placing a limit on their minimum extinction; this result hints that star formation has only just begun in the cloud. Together, these results suggest that, despite already holding the crown for most actively star-forming cloud, we have underestimated the total star formation in Sgr B2. JWST unveils previously hidden massive stars and ionized structures, offering a transformative view of how stars form under some of the most extreme Galactic conditions.",

Both star-forming (SF) and quiescent (QS) misaligned galaxies exhibit narrower HI linewidths compared to their gas-star aligned controls. The HI profiles of SF misaligned galaxies tend to be single-peaked, displaying a slightly higher fraction of single-peaked shape compared to their aligned controls. The QS misaligned galaxies exhibit prominently single-peaked HI profiles, while their aligned controls show distinct double-horned profiles. The shape of HI profiles is expected to change with the HI surface density radial gradients through external gas accretion -- the interaction between the accreted gas and the pre-existing gas leads to the re-distribution of angular momentum and induces gas inflow. It suggests that the progenitors of SF misaligned galaxies are central HI-enriched, in this case, the shape of HI profiles is insensitive to the further increase of central HI surface density. The progenitors of QS misaligned galaxies are central HI-deficient, hence the transition from central HI-deficient to HI-enriched surface density leads to significantly more single-peaked HI profiles.",

We identify the presence of low-luminosity FRII sources, the proportion of which, with respect to the total number of FRIIs, is consistent with previous studies. However, a comparison of the low-luminosity FRII sources found in this work with those identified by previous studies reveals differences that may indicate their selection is influenced by the choice of classification methodology. We investigate the impacts of both pre-training and fine-tuning data selection on model performance for the downstream classification task, and show that while different pre-training data choices affect model confidence they do not appear to cause systematic generalisation biases for the range of physical and observational characteristics considered in this work; however, we note that the same is not necessarily true for fine-tuning. As automated approaches to astronomical source identification and classification become increasingly prevalent, we highlight training data choices that can affect the model outputs and propagate into downstream analyses.",

Previous analyses of observations using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) carbon monoxide (CO) line emission maps did not classify these sources as cool outflow hosts. Using new high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, JWST mid-infrared photometry in the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-tracing F770W band, we identify extended structures present off of the stellar disk. The identified structures are bright in the MIRI F770W and F2100W bands, suggesting they include PAHs as well as other dust grains. As PAHs have been shown to be destroyed in hot, ionized gas, these structures are likely to be outflows of cool (T$\\leq 10^4$K) gas. This work represents an exciting possibility for using mid infrared observations to identify and measure outflows in lower mass, lower star formation galaxies.",

In the early Universe, dust is thought to form primarily in supernova (SN) ejecta, but also undergoes destruction by the reverse shock. Studying dust in local supernova remnants (SNRs) of different sizes and ages thus provides key constraints on dust formation and evolution during cosmic dawn. Using the newly released 3D $R_{\\rm V}$ map, we derived local $R_{\\rm V} \\equiv A_{\\rm V}/E(B-V)$ values for dust in 14 Galactic SNRs in the early Sedov phase and their surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). For the first time, we detect a moderately strong positive correlation between the difference in SNR and ISM $R_{\\rm V}$ ($\\Delta R_{\\rm V}$) and SNR radius ($R_{\\rm SNR}$), with a Spearman coefficient of $r_{\\rm s}\\,{=}\\,0.62\\,{\\pm}\\,0.14$. This trend offers direct observational evidence for a redistribution of dust grain sizes toward larger grains during SN shock processing, consistent with theoretical models. Our findings provide essential observational constraints on dust size evolution in SNRs and important implications for understanding the rapid enrichment and survival of dust in the early Universe.",

Freundlich, F. Mertens, A. Marchal, G. Sainton, F. Combes, C. Tasse Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) As the scientific exploitation of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) approaches, there is a need for new advanced data analysis and visualization tools capable of processing large high-dimensional datasets. In this study, we aim to generalize the YOLO-CIANNA deep learning source detection and characterization method for 3D hyperspectral HI emission cubes. We present the adaptations we made to the regression-based detection formalism and the construction of an end-to-end 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone. We then describe a processing pipeline for applying the method to simulated 3D HI cubes from the SKA Observatory Science Data Challenge 2 (SDC2) dataset. The YOLO-CIANNA method was originally developed and used by the MINERVA team that won the official SDC2 competition. Despite the public release of the full SDC2 dataset, no published result has yet surpassed MINERVA's top score. In this paper, we present an updated version of our method that improves our challenge score by 9.5%. The resulting catalog exhibits a high detection purity of 92.3%, best-in-class characterization accuracy, and contains 45% more confirmed sources than concurrent classical detection tools. The method is also computationally efficient, processing the full ~1TB SDC2 data cube in 30 min on a single GPU. These state-of-the-art results highlight the effectiveness of 3D CNN-based detectors for processing large hyperspectral data cubes and represent a promising step toward applying YOLO-CIANNA to observational data from SKA and its precursors.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Isomerism in complex organic molecules provides key insights into the formation mechanisms and physical conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM). Among the C$_2$H$_5$NO isomers, only acetamide and trans-N-methylformamide (trans-NMF) have been detected in space. The recent detection of higher-energy isomers in other chemical families raises questions about the formation and abundance of less stable isomers. We used ultra-sensitive wide-band spectral surveys obtained with the Yebes 40 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes to search for cis-NMF towards the Galactic Centre molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. We present the first detection of cis-NMF in the ISM, with 55 unblended or slightly blended transitions, 44 of which were new transitions identified based on extrapolated spectroscopic data. Due to the lack of collisional rate coefficients, a quasi-non-LTE analysis, which separated the transitions into different K$_a$ ladders, was used to determine the excitation conditions. The resulting trans/cis-NMF isomeric ratio of 2.9$\\pm$0.6 deviates significantly from thermodynamic expectations, suggesting that kinetic non-equilibrium processes and stereospecific chemical pathways are responsible for the formation of cis-NMF in this environment. The detection of cis-NMF expands the known inventory of interstellar C$_2$H$_5$NO isomers and challenges the assumption that isomer abundances strictly correlate with thermodynamic stability. Laboratory and theoretical studies propose formation via CH$_3$NCO hydrogenation or spin-forbidden reactions involving CH$_2$ and NH$_2$CHO, though these may not reflect typical ISM conditions. This finding highlights the need for further investigation into isomerisation mechanisms and constrains astrochemical models of complex organic molecules.",

Accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a steady-state analytical model for pressure-regulated formation of molecular clouds (MC) and stars (SF) in gaseous galactic disks and apply it to the Milky Way (MW). MC formation depends on midplane interstellar pressure $P_{\\text{ISM}}$ and metallicity $Z$, and for galactocentric distances $R\\gtrsim5$ kpc, $P_{\\text{ISM}}(R)$ scales approximately linearly with molecular gas surface density $\\Sigma_{\\rm mol}(R)$. The molecularization of the cold neutral medium (CNM) is due to the opacity of small dust grains that protect the center of the cloud from dissociating radiation when the column density is $\\Sigma_d\\geq 5\\ (Z/Z_\\odot)M_\\odot\\text{ pc}^{-2}$. The H$_2$ formation rate per hydrogen atom is $F\\sim10^{-15}(P_{\\text{ISM}}/P_\\odot)T_{100}^{-1/2}\\text{s}^{-1}$, and the corresponding formation rate per unit area is $\\dot{\\Sigma}^{+}_{\\rm mol}\\sim 5\\times10^{-2}\\left(P_{\\text{ISM}}/{P_\\odot}\\right)T_{100}^{-1/2}M_\\odot~\\text{kpc}^{-2}~\\text{yr}^{-1}$, where $P_\\odot$ is the pressure at the solar circle and $T_{100}=T/100\\text{ K}$ is the temperature of the cloud. In equilibrium, this equals the molecular gas destruction rate $\\dot{\\Sigma}^{-}_{\\rm mol}$ due to SF. Self-gravity sets in when the column density of a cloud reaches $\\Sigma_{\\rm sg}=\\Sigma_{\\rm sg,\\odot}(P_{\\text{ISM}}/P_\\odot)^{1/2}$, with $\\Sigma_{\\rm sg,\\odot}\\sim30\\ M_\\odot\\ \\text{pc}^{-2}$. Given the distribution of $P_{\\text{ISM}}(R)$ and $Z(R)$ in the MW, the SF process at $5\\lesssim R\\lesssim11$ kpc follows a two-step track: first, MCs form from CNM gas and then they form stars when self-gravity sets in.

Our sample includes nine objects found in three JWST wide survey fields, which have z=3.624 to 5.378 and M_B ~ -18.3 to -21.4 mag. Their light distributions follow gaussian profiles, with the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) values only 3.7%--34.6% larger than those of the point spread functions. Their sharpest FWHM sizes correspond to only 0.49 to 0.96 kpc. They have very strong [O III] and Halpha lines (median rest-frame equivalent widths of 1610.6 and 1374.0 A, respectively), and the line widths of the latter are only 150--360 km/s. Due to the limitation of the current data, the exact nature of this new population is still uncertain. The emission line diagnostics shows that at least one object is consistent with being AGN. On the other hand, the spectral energy distributions of most of the nine objects can be fitted reasonably by normal galaxy templates, which suggest that they could also be very young (median age of 120 Myrs), star-forming (median star formation rate of 1.8 Msun/yr) galaxies in the early formation stage (having acquired a median stellar mass of only 10^{8.4} Msun). If they are indeed star-forming galaxies, their gas-phase metallicities range from 12+log(O/H) = 7.8 to 8.3. It will be critical to understand this population by deeper medium-resolution spectroscopy in the future. If they are AGNs, they constitute a new kind of type 2 AGNs that are low-luminosity and almost \"hostless\". If they are star-forming galaxies, they also constitute a new kind whose early formation is likely a secular process starting from a very compact core, which is in line with the picture of a monolithic collapse.",

We use these hot, bright stars to investigate extinctions towards a complete sample of 262 confirmed PNe with large angular diameters, which have the most reliable photometry and hottest central stars. For 162 of these PNe, we identify central stars, produce spectral energy distributions from survey data using PySSED, then fit reddened model spectra to the observed photometry to obtain extinctions accurate down to $E(B-V)$ of $\\pm 0.02$ mag. The fitting is performed by Nelder-Mead $\\chi^2$ minimisation, with uncertainties evaluated through MCMC. The catalogue of stellar temperatures is updated for our sample for the calculation of luminosities. The extinctions agree well with interstellar extinction. We find evidence of circumnebular extinction for one PN, and evaluate its effect on the planetary nebulae luminosity function. Four new close binaries are identified from the spectral energy distributions. The binary fraction in the full sample is between 23% and 36%. We use our compiled data to evaluate the quality of the central star identifications in the literature.

Freedman, Hamidreza Mahani Accepted for publication in ApJ Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The Period-Luminosity (PL) relation is usually derived using time-averaged magnitudes, which require multiple-epoch observations to determine periods and adequately sample the light curves. Although single-epoch observations are more practical and require significantly less observational effort, they inherently introduce greater photometric scatter, leading to an increased dispersion in the derived Period-Luminosity relations. In this paper, we explore, in detail, a method that transforms single random-phase data to their mean-light values, using information obtained in other bands for the same Cepheid. This approach enables the accurate re-construction of mean-light PL relations for wavelengths observed with space-based facilities, for instance, where the number of epochs per star makes simple averaging or template fitting less than optimal, with the latter requiring very high-precision periods for predictive phasing. While applying this technique across multiple bands, from optical to mid-IR, we focus particularly on widely separated bands covering the mid-IR to the optical. We showcase this method using the J band (as being observed by JWST) as the random-phase component. Our results show that this correction reduces the scatter of the PL relation in the J band by a factor of approximately $0.7\\times$, equivalent to increasing the number of random-phase observations by a factor of 10, needed to obtain the same increase in precision as delivered here.",

Also, in a sample of bulge spheroid stars, some of them showed a moderate P-enhancement in the range +0.5 < [P/Fe] < +1.0. In this paper we derive the P abundance of moderately metal-poor ([Fe/H] ~-1) GC stars, aiming to check if the phenomenon could be related to the unusual multiple stellar populations found in most GCs. Here we present the detection of P-moderately enhanced stars among two out of seven bulge GCs (Tonantzintla 1, and NGC 6316_, with metallicities similar to those of the bulge field P-rich stars. Using H-band high-resolution (R~22,500) spectra from the APOGEE-2 survey, we present the first high-resolution abundance analysis of [P/Fe] from the PI 16482.932 A line in a sample of selected bulge GCs. We find that all P-rich stars tend to also be N-rich, that hints at the origin of P-rich stars as second-generation stars in GCs. However no other correlations of P and other elements are found, that are usually indicators of second-generation stars. Further studies with larger samples and comparisons with field stars will be needed before any firm conclusions are drawn.",

Accepted for publication in MNRAS Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Stellar flybys are likely to be common in young star-forming regions and could be responsible for substructures observed in protoplanetary discs. Using three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations, we study dust trapping in discs perturbed by parabolic coplanar flybys. We find that spiral structures are induced in the gas and dust discs for both prograde and retrograde encounters. By tracking individual dust particles within the flyby-induced substructures, we determine that they have a highly enhanced dust to gas ratio compared to particles in an unperturbed disc. We further find that the local dust to gas ratios in flyby-induced substructures are sufficiently high to trigger the streaming instability and hence facilitate planetesimal formation in young discs.",

Martinez, Barbara Rojas-Ayala, Zachary Way Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Open clusters are one of the best astrophysical laboratories we have available for stellar astrophysics studies. This work presents metallicities and individual abundances for fourteen M dwarfs and six G dwarfs from two well-known open clusters: Hyades and Coma Berenices. Our analysis is based on near-infrared (1.51--1.69 $\\mu$m), high-resolution ($R \\sim 22,500$) spectra obtained from the SDSS IV/APOGEE Survey. Using one-dimensional, plane-parallel MARCS model atmospheres, the APOGEE line list, and the Turbospectrum radiative transfer code in local thermodynamic equilibrium, we derived spectroscopic stellar parameters for the M dwarfs, along with abundances of 13 elements (C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Fe) for both M and G dwarfs. We find a high degree of chemical homogeneity within each cluster when comparing abundances derived from M and G dwarfs: $\\delta$[M/H] (M dwarfs -- G dwarfs) of 0.01$\\pm$0.04, and 0.02$\\pm$0.03 for the Hyades and Coma Berenices, respectively. The overall cluster metallicities derived from M dwarfs (Hyades: 0.16$\\pm$0.03 and Coma Berenices: 0.02$\\pm$0.06) are consistent with previous literature determinations. Finally, we demonstrate the value of M dwarfs as key tracers in galactic archaeology, emphasizing their potential for studying galactic metallicity gradients and chemical evolution.",

Rodriguez-Gomez, A. La Marca Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Galaxy mergers are crucial for understanding galaxy evolution, and with large upcoming datasets, automated methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are needed for efficient detection. It is understood that these networks work by identifying deviations from the regular, expected shapes of galaxies, which are indicative of a merger event. Using images from the IllustrisTNG simulations, we aim to check the importance of faint features, source position and shape information present in galaxy merger images on the performance of a CNN merger vs. non-merger classifier. We fit Sérsic profiles to each galaxy in mock images from the IllustrisTNG simulations. We subtract the profiles from the original images to create residual images, and we train three identical CNNs on three different datasets -- original images (CNN1), model images (CNN2), and residual images (CNN3). We found that it is possible to conduct galaxy merger classification based only on faint features, source position and shape information present in residual images and model images, respectively. The results show that the CNN1 correctly classifies 74% of images, while CNN2 70%, and CNN3 68%. Source position and shape information is crucial for pre-merger classification, while residual features are important for post-merger classification. CNN3 classifies post-mergers in the latest merger stage the best out of all three classifiers.",

Wyse, Rintaro Mori 18 pages, 16 figures, 5 tables, Accepted to PASJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We derive the star formation history (SFH) and chemical evolution history (CEH) of the Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph). We detect two distinct stellar populations that exist over 6 times half-light radius from its center. The results are obtained by applying a newly developed algorithm to the deep and wide-field photometric dataset taken with Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope. The algorithm employs the genetic algorithm and the simulated annealing to minimize a $\\chi^{2}$ value between the observed color-magnitude diagram (CMD) and synthetic CMD generated from the stellar isochrones. The age and metallicity resolutions are set to $0.5$ Gyr and $0.1$ dex, respectively. The accuracy assessment with mock galaxies shows that it returns the peaks of metallicity distributions and star formation period within 1 $\\sigma$ of input value in the case of a single population. In tests with two populations, two distinct metallicity peaks are identified without an offset from the input values, indicating the robustness of this algorithm. The detected two populations in the UMi dSph have the metallicity peaks of [Fe/H] = $-2.2$ and $-2.5$; the metal-rich population started its star formation about 1 Gyr later than the metal-poor one. The SFH of both metal-rich and metal-poor populations varies with distance from the center of the UMi dSph, without any age-gradients. These results suggest that the UMi dSph underwent a complex formation process, contrary to the simple formation history of dwarf galaxies previously thought.",

In this work we investigate the persistence and stability of the VPOS over time. We identify VPOS member galaxies and integrate their orbits over the past 5 Gyr using time evolving gravitational potentials that account for the mutual interaction between the MW and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The reconstructed trajectories allow us to examine the long-term evolution of the VPOS. We identify 15 galaxies as members of the VPOS, including 9 MW and 6 LMC satellites. We find that the VPOS has remained a stable structure, maintaining a roughly constant thickness ($\\sim$ 15 kpc), flattening ($c/a \\sim$ 0.2), and orientation over time. While the LMC exerts a strong gravitational influence on the MW satellites, its impact on the VPOS is limited, leading only to mild perturbations. The structural properties of the VPOS remain almost unchanged, whether or not LMC satellites are included in the analysis, indicating a smooth dynamical integration with the rest of VPOS members upon entering the MW virial radius. This minimal dynamical impact on the VPOS results from the remarkable alignment between the LMC's orbit and the plane's orientation. We conclude that the VPOS is a stable, long-lived structure that predates the recent infall of the LMC and retains nearly constant structural properties over the last 5 Gyrs. Our findings suggest a strong connection between the VPOS and the LMC, consistent with a scenario in which the LMC is on its second pericentre and the VPOS originated primarily from satellites stripped during the first passage.",

Thanks to its sensitivity and spectral resolution, JWST has the potential to observe ice features towards hundreds of sources at different stages along the process of star formation. However, identifying the spectral features of the different species and quantifying the ice composition is not trivial and requires complex spectroscopic analysis. We present Automatic Ice Composition Estimator (AICE), a new tool based on artificial neural networks. Based on the infrared (IR) ice absorption spectrum between 2.5 and 10 microns, AICE predicts the ice fractional composition in terms of $\\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\\mathrm{CO}$, $\\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\\mathrm{CH_3OH}$, $\\mathrm{NH_3}$, and $\\mathrm{CH_4}$. To train the model, we used hundreds of laboratory experiments of ice mixtures from different databases, which were reprocessed with baseline subtraction and normalisation. Once trained, AICE takes less than one second on a conventional computer to predict the ice composition associated with the observed IR absorption spectrum, with typical errors of $\\sim$3 $\\%$ in the species fraction. We tested its performance on two spectra reported towards the NIR38 and J110621 background stars observed within the JWST Ice Age program, demonstrating a good agreement with previous estimations of the ice composition. The fast and accurate performance of AICE enables the systematic analysis of hundreds of different ice spectra with a modest time investment. In addition, this model can be enhanced and re-trained with more laboratory data, improving the precision of the predictions and expanding the list of predicted species.",

We examine their demographics, kinematics, stellar populations, metallicity gradients and star formation histories. We derive scaling relations linking NSDs to properties of their host galaxies, and compare them with analogous relations for nuclear star clusters. The relationship between NSDs and other central galactic components, including nuclear rings, nuclear bars, and nuclear star clusters, is explored. The role of NSDs as tracers of the secular evolution of barred galaxies is highlighted, emphasising how they can be used to constrain properties of galactic bars such as their ages. Special attention is given to the Milky Way's NSD, which serves as a unique case study thanks to its proximity and the ability to resolve individual stars. The review covers the Milky Way's NSD structure, kinematics, dynamics and stellar content, addressing ongoing debates about the presence of a nuclear bar and implications of the latter for central gas dynamics. We argue that NSDs form by in-situ star formation, most of them because of bar-driven gas inflow, but possibly in some cases because of external acquisition of gas during a gas-rich merger. The review concludes by outlining open questions, future research directions and the exciting prospects provided by upcoming observational facilities.",

However, their origin remains poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of a septuple protostellar system embedded in a Keplerian disk within the high-mass star-forming region NGC\\,6334IN, with close separations of 181-461 AU. The stability analysis reveals that the disk surrounding the septuple system is dynamically unstable, indicating that the septuple system formed via disk fragmentation. Previous studies have typically found only 2--3 members forming via disk fragmentation in both low- and high-mass star-forming regions. Our findings provide compelling observational evidence that the fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable disk is a viable mechanism for the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity, confirming what was previously only a theoretical concept. The results shed new light on the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity in cluster environments.",

Using photogeometric distances, line-of-sight velocities and Gaia DR3 proper motions, we map 3D Galactocentric velocities across the Galactic plane to $\\sim$5 kpc from the Sun, with a focus on radial motions ($v_R$). Our results reveal mean radial motion with amplitudes of $\\pm 30$ km/s that are coherent on kiloparsec scales, alternating between inward and outward motions. These $\\bar{v}_R$ amplitudes are considerably higher than those observed for older, red giant populations. These kinematic patterns show only a weak correlation with spiral arm over-densities. Age estimates, derived from MIST isochrones, indicate that 85% of the sample is younger than $\\sim300$ Myr and that the youngest stars ($\\le 30$ Myr) align well with density enhancements. The age-dependent $\\bar{v}_R$ in Auriga makes it plausible that younger stars exhibits different velocity variations than older giants. The origin of the radial velocity features remains uncertain, and may result from a combination of factors, including spiral arm dynamics, the Galactic bar, resonant interactions, or phase mixing following a perturbation. The present analysis is based on approximately one-third of the full target sample. The completed survey will enable a more comprehensive investigation of these features and a detailed dynamical interpretation.",

Moscardini Submitted to A&A following internal review Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Star clusters are valuable indicators of galaxy evolution, offering insights into the buildup of stellar populations across cosmic time. Understanding intrinsic star cluster populations of dwarf galaxies is particularly important given their role in the hierarchical growth of larger systems. Using Euclid Early Release Observation data, we study star clusters in two star-forming dwarf irregulars in the Local Group, NGC 6822 and IC 10 [$M_\\star \\sim$ (1--4) $\\times10^8 M_\\odot$]. With Euclid, clusters are resolved into individual stars across the main bodies and haloes of both galaxies. Visual inspection of $I_E$ images uncovers 30 new cluster candidates in NGC 6822 and 16 in IC 10, from compact to extended clusters. We re-evaluate literature candidates, producing combined catalogues of 52 (NGC 6822) and 71 (IC 10) clusters with confidence-based classifications. We present homogeneous photometry in $I_E$, $Y_E$, $J_E$, $H_E$, and archival UBVRI data, alongside size measurements and properties from BAGPIPES SED fitting. Synthetic cluster injection shows our sample is $\\sim 50$% complete to $M \\lesssim 10^3 M_\\odot$ for ages $\\lesssim 100$ Myr, and to $M \\lesssim 3\\times10^4 M_\\odot$ for $\\sim 10$ Gyr. IC 10 has more young clusters than NGC 6822, extending to higher masses, consistent with its starburst nature. Both dwarfs host several old massive ($\\gtrsim 10^5 M_\\odot$) clusters, including an exceptional $1.3 \\times 10^6 M_\\odot$ cluster in NGC 6822's outskirts. In NGC 6822, we identify a previously undetected, old, extended cluster ($R_h = 12.4 \\pm 0.11$ pc). Using well-defined criteria, we identify 11 candidate GCs in NGC 6822 and eight in IC 10. Both galaxies have high specific frequencies ($S_N$) but remain consistent with known GC scaling relations at low luminosity [abridged].",

Wyatt, Cristobal Petrovich, Philippe Thébault, Renu Malhotra, Virginie Faramaz-Gorka Accepted for publication in MNRAS; 29 Pages, 13 Figures, 1 Table Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Debris discs provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of exoplanetary systems. Their structures are commonly attributed to planetary perturbations, serving as probes of as-yet-undetected planets. However, most studies of planet-debris disc interactions ignore the disc's gravity, treating it as a collection of massless planetesimals. Here, using an analytical model, we investigate how the vertical structure of a back-reacting debris disc responds to secular perturbations from an inner, inclined planet. Considering the disc's axisymmetric potential, we identify two dynamical regimes: planet-dominated and disc-dominated, which may coexist, separated by a secular-inclination resonance. In the planet-dominated regime ($M_d/m_p\\ll1$), we recover the classical result: a transient warp propagates outward until the disc settles into a box-like structure centered around the planetary orbit's initial inclination $I_p(0)$, with a distance-independent aspect ratio $\\mathcal{H}(R)\\approx I_p(0)$. In contrast, in the disc-dominated regime ($M_d/m_p\\gtrsim1$), the disc exhibits dynamical rigidity, remaining thin and misaligned, with significantly suppressed inclinations and a sharply declining aspect ratio, $\\mathcal{H}(R)\\propto I_p(0)R^{-7/2}$. In the intermediate regime ($M_d/m_p\\lesssim1$), the system exhibits a secular-inclination resonance, leading to long-lived, warp-like structures and a bimodal inclination distribution, containing both dynamically hot and cold populations. We provide analytic formulae describing these effects as a function of system parameters. We also find that the vertical density profile is intrinsically non-Gaussian and recommend fitting observations with non-zero slopes of $\\mathcal{H}(R)$. Our results may be used to infer planetary parameters and debris disc masses based on observed warps and scale heights, as demonstrated for HD 110058 and $\\beta$ Pic.",

Herrero 19 pages, 16 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Modern spectroscopic surveys combined with Gaia distances are enabling reliable estimates of fundamental parameters for hundreds of Galactic O-type stars and the full range of spectral types and luminosity classes. Here we provide updated, statistically robust empirical calibrations of the fundamental parameters of Galactic O-type stars, as well as of their absolute visual magnitudes (Mv) and bolometric corrections (BC), based on high-quality observational data. We perform a homogeneous analysis of a sample of 358 Galactic O-type stars, combining high-resolution spectroscopy and Gaia distances. A subset of 234 stars meeting strict quality criteria involving parallax, extinction, and multi-band photometry was used to derive empirical calibrations of fundamental parameters. For those same stars, calibrated parameters were estimated from their measured Mv using the derived relations, allowing us to assess the internal consistency and predictive power of the calibrations. We present updated spectral-type-based calibrations of fundamental parameters for luminosity classes V, III, and I. Compared to previous works, we find systematic shifts, particularly in effective temperature for dwarfs and in Mv across all classes, which propagate into derived quantities. Applying the Mv calibrations to the full sample yields consistent estimates of radius and luminosity, while spectroscopic mass (Msp) shows significant scatter. We also evaluate the FW3414 parameter (from the Hbeta line) as a calibrator for Mv, useful in large surveys lacking reliable spectral classification. Excluding SB1 systems has a noticeable impact only on the Msp calibration for LC V. These updated empirical calibrations offer a robust reference for Galactic O-type stars and will support studies of massive star populations in both Galactic and extragalactic contexts, particularly in the era of large spectroscopic surveys.",

Spatially resolved observations of disks at multiple wavelengths can allow to infer the distribution of various dust grains and gas species. Combining these observations offers a more complete understanding of dust structure and properties across different disk locations. For example, by better characterizing the disk vertical structure, observations help to constrain the level of vertical settling and identify regions of high dust density, which are favorable for grain growth and planet formation.

The physical properties of WLFs in super active regions (SARs) are also well worth investigating. With full-disk images at 3600 Å (in the Balmer continuum) from the White-light Solar Telescope (WST) on board the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory, we here study the M- and X-class WLFs occurring in SAR NOAA 13664/13697 (a same region in two solar Carrington rotations) during May/June 2024. 48 WLFs at 3600 Å are identified from 89 available samples with an occurrence rate of 53.9%, which is much higher than that (23.9%) of a longterm-continuous data set from October 2022 to May 2023 in our previous work (Jing et al. 2024). In particular, with an additional sample of over 730 M- and X-class flares from October 2022 to June 2024, we find that the occurrence rate of WLFs shows a good correlation with the solar cycle represented by sunspot counts. As regards the properties of the emission at 3600 Å, the WLFs in SAR NOAA 13664/13697 have some different characteristics, say, a longer duration but a weaker relative enhancement and a smaller brightening area compared with the previous long-term-continuous sample. We also find that for WLFs in NOAA 13664/13697 the relation between the duration and energy at 3600 Å is described by a power-law with index of 0.35, which is similar to the results found for superflares in Sun-like stars (Kowalski 2024). All these help us understand the solar WLFs in SARs and also provide important insights into the superflares on Sun-like stars.",

There remains much mystery about how or if wave-energy in the photosphere can be transferred sufficiently upwards through the solar atmosphere to contribute to coronal heating. In light of a plethora of theoretical and idealised studies, we must complement our understanding with realistic and self-driven simulations in order to confidently quantify such contributions. Aims. In this study we aim to connect the various environments from the photosphere to low corona and identify wave drivers, transitions and dissipation mechanisms. We will analyse the effects of the presence of twisted magnetic features and vortical flows on the transport of such wave modes as the structures evolve. Methods. We adopt the most significant frequency (MSF) decomposition method to trace wave activity through a 3D realistic quiet Sun simulation. We focus on vertical and temporal evolution, identifying wave sources and shifts in the dominant modes. Results. We identify two frequencies, at 3.5 and 5 mHz, that connect oscillations in the upper convection zone to the dynamics in the solar atmosphere. We see distinct differences in the absence and presence of swirling structures on the upwards propagation of these oscillations. Furthermore, we validate the use of the highest frequency MSFs as a proxy for the location of shocks in the chromosphere, and use the results to understand the connection between shocks and the propagation of oscillations in the upper atmosphere. We discuss the relation of energy transfer via shocks, mode conversion, and jets. Finally, we find the contribution of 3.5 and 5 mHz signals to the overall wave power in the domain to be significant, up to 50%.",

Richard DeVore Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The magnetic breakout model explains a variety of solar eruptions, ranging from small-scale jets to large-scale coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Most of our previous studies are focused on jets and CMEs in single null-point topologies. Here, we investigate the initiation of CMEs and associated particle acceleration in a double null-point (or nested fan-spine) topology during multiple homologous M- and X-class flares from an active region. The initiation of the flare and associated eruption begins with inflow structures moving towards the inner null of the closed fan-spine topology. The first explosive breakout reconnection of the flux rope at the inner null produced a circular and remote ribbons along with successful eruption of the flux rope and associated fast EUV (shock) wave. Simultaneous flare reconnection beneath the erupting flux rope produced a typical two-ribbon flare along with two hard X-ray footpoint sources. When the flux rope (with shock) reaches the outer null, the second explosive breakout reconnection produces another large-scale remote ribbon. The radio observations reveal quasiperiodic Type III bursts (period=100-s) and a Type II burst during the breakout reconnection near the inner and outer nulls, along with gradual solar energetic particles (SEPs) observed at 1 AU for magnetically connected events. This study highlight the importance of two successive breakout reconnection in the initiation of CMEs in nested-null topologies and associated particle acceleration/release into the interplanetary medium. The particles are accelerated by the shock ahead of the flux rope, which formed during the inner breakout reconnection. These findings have significant implications for particle acceleration and escape processes in multi-scale null-point topologies that produce jets and CMEs.",

The manuscript comprises 11 pages and 8 figures Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) Erupting flux ropes play crucial role in powering a wide range of solar transients, including flares, jets, and coronal mass ejections. These events are driven by the release of stored magnetic energy, facilitated by the shear in the complex magnetic topologies. However, the mechanisms governing the formation and eruption of flux ropes, particularly the role of magnetic shear distribution in coronal arcades are not fully understood. We employ magnetohydrodynamic simulations incorporating nonadiabatic effects of optically thin radiative losses, magnetic field-aligned thermal conduction, and spatially varying (steady) background heating, to realistically model the coronal environment. A stratified solar atmosphere under gravity is initialized with a non-force-free field comprising sheared arcades. We study two different cases by varying the initial shear to analyze their resulting dynamics, and the possibility of flux rope formation and eruptions. Our results show that strong initial magnetic shear leads to spontaneous flux rope formation and eruption via magnetic reconnection, driven by Lorentz force. The shear distribution infers the non-potentiality distributed along arcades and demonstrates its relevance in identifying sites prone to eruptive activity. The evolution of mean shear and the relative strength between guide to reconnection fields during the pre- and post-eruption phases are explored, with implications of bulk heating for the ``hot onset'' phenomena in flares, and particle acceleration. On the other hand, the weaker shear case does not lead to formation of any flux ropes. Our findings highlight the limitations of relying solely on foot point shear and underscore the need for coronal scale diagnostics. These results are relevant for understanding eruptive onset conditions and can promote a better interpretation of coronal observations from current and future missions.",

Mróz Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We investigated microlensing events detected by the OGLE and KMTNet surveys during the 2024 observing season, focusing on those that exhibit very complex anomaly features. Through this analysis, we found that the light curves of three events including OGLE-2024-BLG-0657, KMT-2024-BLG-2017, and KMT-2024-BLG-2480 cannot be readily interpreted using standard three-body lensing models such as a binary lens with a single source (2L1S) or a single lens with a binary source (1L2S). In this work we present detailed analyses of these events to uncover the nature of their anomalous features. An initial analysis using 2L1S modeling of the light curves showed that while it was difficult to simultaneously explain all of the multiple anomaly features, the main anomaly feature could be accounted for. Based on this model, we conducted four-body modeling that includes an additional lens or source. Through this approach, we found that the complex anomalies observed in the three events could be explained by a 2L2S model, in which both the lens and the source are binaries. Analysis of the color and magnitude revealed that the source is a binary system consisting of G- and K-type main sequence stars for OGLE-2024-BLG-0657, two K-type main sequence stars for KMT-2024-BLG-2017, and a K-type star with an early G-type main sequence companion for KMT-2024-BLG-2480. A Bayesian analysis incorporating constraints from the lensing observables indicates that the lenses in KMT-2024-BLG-2017 and KMT-2024-BLG-2480 are likely binary systems of low-mass stars located in the Galactic bulge, whereas the lens system OGLE-2024-BLG-0657L is likely a binary composed of two stellar remnants situated in the Galactic disk.",

We aim to study the properties of a quiescent coronal rain event and its effect on the solar atmosphere. We utilise space-based data from the \\textit{High-Resolution Imager in Extreme Ultraviolet} of Solar Orbiter, the \\textit{Atmospheric Imaging Assembly} of the Solar Dynamics Observatory, and the Slit-Jaw Imager (SJI) from the \\textit{Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph} from November 1st, 2023.

Coronal rain clumps with total velocities between 72~km~s$^{-1}$ and 87~km~s$^{-1}$ and cool EUV absorbing core sizes of $\\approx$600~km and densities of $\\approx5\\times10^{11}$~cm$^{-3}$ are seen to fall with a strong compression ahead. During the compression we measure a low polytropic index with $\\gamma=1.085$, suggesting the presence of molecules. The rain shower carries a total of $3.09\\times10^{26}$~erg, and the clumps produce impacts seen in all EUV channels and in SJI~1400~Å.

We find signatures of a steady footpoint heating, in agreement with the TNE-TI scenario, with an estimated amplitude of $2.56\\times10^{-2}~$erg~cm$^{-3}$~s$^{-1}$ in agreement with active region estimates. Coronal rain may therefore be a good proxy for the total integrated heating that gives birth to TNE-TI.",

Draft prepared for submission to ApJ; comments welcome to this http URL [at] this http URL Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Decades of observations on the star V Canum Venaticorum (V CVn) have revealed an unusual inverse relationship between its linear polarization and light curves (sometimes with a lead/lag time between them) and an almost constant polarization position angle. One theory proposed to explain this behaviour is the existence of a bow shock driven by a spherically symmetric time-varying dusty wind from the star, which is assumed to vary due to radial pulsations. To test this hypothesis, this study uses a new framework developed in \\textsc{ZEUS3D}, a multiphysics magnetohydrodynamics code. The results of this work show that when a time-varying stellar wind is at its maximum brightness, the polarization signal is at a minimum due to the wind structure and a dense, symmetric shell that forms around the star. Conversely, when the brightness is at a minimum, the symmetric shell around the star is much less dense, and the polarization is instead dominated by the asymmetric bow shock structure, causing the polarization signal to attain a maximum value. Numerically reproducing the observed inverse relationship between the polarization and light curve provides a strong theoretical argument that a variable stellar wind bow shock is the solution to the curious case of V CVn.",

Here, we show that most of daily and hourly periodic variations in visible light brightness of the high corona (up to 15 Rs) are aligned to the tip of streamers and are consistent with the periodicity of plasma release from simulations of tearing-induced magnetic reconnection at the heliospheric current sheet. The areas in which we detect periodicities can be used as tracers of non-quiescent fine coronal rays. This also allows their distinction from coronal rays more likely to be real quiescent features or associated with smaller and/or faster unresolved brightness variations. In the low- and middle-corona (down to 1.4 Rs) similar brightness variations are observed along loop-like and cusp-like features marking boundaries of streamers which then connect to radial features in the high corona. This suggests the presence of additional mechanisms in the low- and middle-corona periodically releasing density structures in the solar wind. The periodicity distributions show a solar cycle modulation with shorter periods (smaller structures) during solar maximum. Periodicities are observed within streamers during solar minimum, but are visible at all latitudes, even extending radially from the poles, during solar maximum.",

Kepler, Erin Mentuch Cooper, Karl Gebhardt Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) White dwarfs with infrared excess emission provide a window into the late stages of stellar evolution and the dynamics of circumstellar environments. Using data from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), we characterized 30 white dwarfs exhibiting infrared excess, including 29 DA and 1 DB stars. While an infrared excess can arise from dusty disks or cool (sub-)stellar companions, our sample is limited to stellar companions due to our selection based on SDSS photometry, which is sensitive to excess emission at wavelengths $\\lambda < 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Our sample contains 22 newly identified excess sources not previously reported in the literature. Spectroscopic observations are available for 10 sources via SDSS, of which only 8 have prior spectroscopic classifications in the literature. In this paper, we present the determination of the effective temperature and surface gravity of these white dwarfs. We used the Balmer line profiles to compare with current atmospheric models to determine the photospheric parameters of the white dwarfs, minimizing contamination introduced by the infrared source. We used photometric data from the SDSS and the \\textit{Gaia} mission to resolve the degeneracies between hot and cold solutions from spectroscopy, constraining the photospheric parameters. These results help refine our understanding of white dwarf evolution in binary systems, focusing on stellar companions that cause the infrared excess. This study contributes to identifying systems with potential substellar companions or unresolved stellar partners, adding to the growing effort to map out the fate of planetary systems after their host stars evolve beyond the main sequence.",

This system with ongoing mass transfer has been extensively observed, using photometry, spectroscopy and interferometry. All these observations were recently interpreted using a radiation-transfer kinematic model.

These profiles were computed for the fixed accretion rate, $\\dot M = 2\\times 10^{-5}\\,M_\\odot\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$, inferred from the observed rate of change of the binary period. More general models were computed numerically, using 1-dimensional radiative hydrodynamics, accounting for viscous, radiative as well as irradiation terms. The initial conditions were taken from the analytical models. To achieve the accretion rate, the surface density~$\\Sigma$ must be much higher (of the order of $10^4\\,{\\rm kg}\\,{\\rm m}^{-2}$ for the viscosity parameter $\\alpha = 0.1$) than in the kinematic model. Viscous dissipation and radiative cooling in the optically thick regime lead to a high midplane temperature~$T$ (up to $10^5\\,{\\rm K}$). The accretion disc is still gas pressure dominated with the opacity close to Kramers one. To reconcile temperature profiles with observations, we had to distinguish three different temperatures: midplane, atmospheric and irradiation. The latter two are comparable to observations (30000 to 12000 $K$). We demonstrate that the aspect ratio~$H$ of 0.08 can be achieved in a hydrostatic equilibrium, as opposed to previous works considering the disc to be vertically unstable.",

Carbon isotope ratios are $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = $79^{+14}_{-11}$ (TWA 27A) and $75^{+2}_{-2}$ (TWA 28); oxygen ratios are $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O = $645^{+80}_{-70}$ and $681^{+53}_{-50}$.

Nick Arge, Jaime A. Landeros Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Coronal holes (CHs) are magnetically open regions that allow hot coronal plasma to escape from the Sun and form the high-speed solar wind. This wind can interact with Earth's magnetic field. For this reason, developing an accurate understanding of CH regions is vital for understanding space weather and its effects on Earth. The process of identifying CH regions typically relies on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imagery, leveraging the fact that CHs appear dark at these wavelengths. Accurate identification of CHs in EUV, however, can be difficult due to a variety of factors, including stray light from nearby regions, limb brightening, and the presence of filaments (which also appear dark, but are not sources of solar wind). In order to overcome these issues, this work incorporates photospheric magnetic field data into a classical EUV-based segmentation algorithm based on the active contours without edges (ACWE) segmentation method. In this work magnetic field data are incorporated directly into the segmentation process, serving both as a method for removing non-CH regions in advance, and as a method to constrain evolution of the segmented CH boundary. This reduces the presence of filaments while allowing the segmentation to include CH regions that may be difficult to identify due to inconsistent intensities.",

To 16 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Radiative losses play a critical role in the cooling of plasmas. When chromospheric plasma is sufficiently heated, it can flow into coronal loops which subsequently cool down due to radiation. From observations, we infer that this cooling does not occur uniformly, often resulting in coronal condensations such as coronal rain. To date, coronal condensations have only been found in simulations of steadily-heated loops, and never in impulsively-heated ones. We implement spatiotemporally variable elemental abundances in a radiative hydrodynamic code. Flows, including chromospheric evaporation, directly cause a shift in the local elemental abundances, which then affects the local radiative loss rate. As a consequence, we find that incorporating spatiotemporal low FIP elemental abundances into coronal loop simulations directly causes coronal condensations, which are otherwise absent in impulsively heated loop or flare models. We conclude that spatiotemporal variations in elemental abundances are a fundamental feature of the solar corona and are therefore necessary to accurately model radiation.",

Tsiklauri The final version accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) In this work we use particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations to study interaction of a spatially uniform electron beam with a rotational magnetic hole in a form of a Harris current sheet. We vary width of the Harris current sheet to investigate how this affects the quasi-linear relaxation, i.e. plateau formation of the bump-on-tail unstable electron beam. We find that when width of the Harris current sheet approaches and becomes smaller than the electron gyro-radius, quasi-linear relaxation becomes hampered and a positive slope in the electron velocity distribution function (VDF) persists. We explain this by the effects of non-conservation of electron magnetic moment, which, as recent works suggest, can maintain the positive slope of the VDF. In part, this can explain why some electron beams (the ones that interact with narrow magnetic holes with sharp boundaries, represented in our study by a Harris current sheet) in the solar wind travel much longer distances than predicted by the quasi-linear theory, at least in those cases when the electron beams slide along the current sheets that are abundant when the different-speed solar wind streams interact with each other.",

Johnston, Lars K. S. Daldorff, James A. Klimchuk, Shanwlee Sow Mondal, Will T. Barnes, James E. Leake, Jack Reid, Jacob D. Parker 21 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The energy that heats the magnetically closed solar corona originates in the complex motions of the massive photosphere. Turbulent photospheric convection slowly displaces the footpoints of coronal field lines, causing them to become twisted and tangled. Magnetic stresses gradually build until reaching a breaking point when the field reconnects and releases a sudden burst of energy. We simulate this basic picture of nanoflares using a high-fidelity, three-dimensional, multi-stranded magnetohydrodynamic simulation that starts with a fully stratified atmosphere. This simulation includes the effects of field-aligned thermal conduction and optically thin radiation and uses the state-of-the-art Transition Region Adaptive Conduction (TRAC) method to capture the response of the plasma to the nanoflare heating. We find that our physical model supports a unified explanation for both the diffuse emission observed in active regions and the bright coronal loops. Specifically, our results suggest that the diffuse emission originates from spatially and temporally uncorrelated nanoflares, whereas coherent clusters of nanoflares - nanoflare storms - are responsible for the formation of bright coronal loops. Quantitative comparisons between the simulated emission and observed characteristics of coronal loops show that key observed properties - such as loop widths, lifetimes and cross sections - are reasonably well reproduced by the model. The idea that avalanche spread naturally leads to circular cross sections in coronal loops is strongly supported. Our results also suggest that phase differences in heating and cooling events across neighboring magnetic flux strands are a plausible explanation for the anomalous cross-field motions of coronal loops that were recently reported in high-resolution observations.",

      "abstract": "On the Encounter Rate of Open Star Clusters A.D. Grinenko, D.A. Kovaleva The paper partially based on a report presented at the Modern Stellar Astronomy 2024 conference Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Probable past and future close encounters of open clusters with known characteristics over 64 million years have been calculated by integrating the orbits of cluster centers in the Galactic potential using the _galpy_ package. It has been shown that in the Galactic neighborhood of the Sun, pairwise cluster encounters at distances comparable to or smaller than their sizes occur at a characteristic rate of 35 to 40 events per 1 Myr. Close encounters between open clusters with a significant age difference occur at a rate of 15 events per Myr. It can be expected that in the Galaxy as a whole, such events occur an order of magnitude more frequently per unit time. Thus, dynamical interactions between stellar ensembles of different ages may not be too rare and could influence the properties of stellar populations. A pair of clusters with similar ages: HSC 1428 and Gulliver 22 was identified as a likely physically bound binary cluster system. A forecast of expected close encounters over the next 32 Myr has been provided for 490 pairs of clusters. Currently, 29 pairs of clusters are at their closest approach.",

One of the mechanisms to reorient the stellar spin involves a secular resonance crossing due to the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk when the system also has an inclined, distant ($\\sim 300\\;\\mathrm{AU}$) binary companion. This mechanism is likely to operate broadly due to the $\\sim 50\\%$ binary fraction of FGK dwarfs and can play an important role in setting the initial stellar obliquities prior to any dynamical evolution. In this work, we revisit this mechanism analytically for idealized, homologously evolving disk models and show that the resulting stellar obliquities are broadly distributed between $60^\\circ$ and $180^\\circ$ for most warm and cold planets. We further show that non-homologus disk dissipation, such as the development of a photoevaporatively-opened gap at $\\sim 2\\;\\mathrm{AU}$, can help maintain orbital alignment of warm planets, in agreement with observations. Our results represent the proper primordial obliquities for planetary systems with distant binary companions. They also represent the obliquities of stars with no present-day binary companions if these companions are dynamically unbound during the birth cluster phase of evolution, a process that occurs on a comparable timescale as the disk-driven obliquity excitation.",

Traditional analytical methods often struggle to fully extract the scientific value of these large and complex datasets. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used for LC analysis, enabling classification, prediction, pattern discovery and anomaly detection. However, research in this area remains fragmented, with no comprehensive synthesis of how ML methods address the specific challenges of LC data. Key difficulties include class imbalance, noisy or sparse measurements, effective feature extraction, and limited interpretability of models. This lack of a unified overview makes it difficult for researchers to identify suitable approaches or recognize unresolved problems that require methodological advances. To address this gap, this survey systematically reviews ML techniques applied to LC analysis, outlining their principles and applications in tasks such as exoplanet detection, variable star classification and supernova identification. By clarifying the current state of the field and highlighting open challenges, this work provides guidance for future research and supports the effective integration of ML into astronomical big data studies.",

Submitted to RASTI Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Line intensity maps have high dynamic range, and demand careful spectral and spatial calibration. We present a Bayesian framework for joint calibration and map-making using Gibbs sampling, which provides access to the full joint posterior of calibration and sky map parameters. Our data model incorporates instrumental noise based on the radiometer equation, capturing the coupling between noise level and system temperature without assuming a fixed noise amplitude. To enable unbiased and fast estimation of gain and system temperature, we develop an iterative generalised least squares (GLS) sampling method. Absolute flux calibration can be achieved either with external sources or internally using known signal injections, such as noise diodes. To handle stochastic gain variations, we introduce a $1/f$ noise model that avoids spurious periodic correlations in the time domain caused by the conventional assumption of diagonal DFT noise covariance. Furthermore, we implement this workflow in an efficient software package, using the Levinson algorithm and a polynomial emulator to reduce the computational complexity of noise parameter sampling, ensuring good scalability. Although demonstrated for auto-correlation measurements, the framework and techniques generalise to cross-correlation and interferometric data.",

Accepted for publication in AJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has identified several thousand planet candidates orbiting a wide variety of stars, and has provided an exciting opportunity for demographic studies. However, current TESS planet searches require significant manual inspection efforts to identify planets among the enormous number of detected transit-like signatures, which limits the scope of such searches. Demographic studies also require a detailed understanding of the relationship between observed and true exoplanet populations; a task for which current TESS planet catalogs are rendered unsuitable by the subjectivity of vetting by eye. We present LEO-Vetter, a publicly available and fully automated exoplanet vetting system designed after the Kepler Robovetter, which is capable of efficiently producing catalogs of promising planet candidates and making statistically robust TESS demographic studies possible. LEO-Vetter implements flux- and pixel-level tests against noise/systematic false positives and astrophysical false positives. The vetter achieves high completeness (91%) and high reliability against noise/systematic false alarms (97%) based on its performance on simulated data. We demonstrate the usefulness of the vetter by searching ~200,000 M dwarf light curves, and reducing ~20,000 transit-like detections down to 172 uniformly vetted planet candidates. LEO-Vetter facilitates analyses that would otherwise be impractical to perform on all possible signals due to time constraints or computational limitations. Users will be able to efficiently produce their own TESS planet catalog starting with transit-like detections, as well as have the framework needed to characterize their catalog's completeness and reliability for occurrence rates.",

      "abstract": "High Dimensional Beam Inference II: Inference of a Perturbed HERA Beam from Simulated Visibility Data Michael J. Wilensky, Philip Bull, Nicolas Fagnoni Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Accurate beam modeling is important in many radio astronomy applications. In this paper, we focus on beam modeling for 21-cm intensity mapping experiments using radio interferometers, though the techniques also apply to single dish experiments with small modifications. In 21-cm intensity mapping, beam models are usually determined from highly detailed electromagnetic simulations of the receiver system. However, these simulations are expensive, and therefore have limited ability to describe practical imperfections in the beam pattern. We present a fully analytic Bayesian inference framework to infer a beam pattern from the interferometric visibilities assuming a particular sky model and that the beam pattern for all elements is identical, allowing one to capture deviations from the ideal beam for relatively low computational cost. We represent the beam using a sparse Fourier-Bessel basis on a projection of the hemisphere to the unit disc, but the framework applies to any linear basis expansion of the primary beam. We test the framework on simulated visibilities from an unpolarized sky, ignoring mutual coupling of array elements. We successfully recover the simulated, perturbed power beam when the sky model is perfect. Briefly exploring sky model inaccuracies, we find that beam inferences are sensitive to them, so we suggest jointly modeling uncertainties in the sky and beam in related inference tasks.",

In this paper, we present the LiteBIRD Simulation Framework (LBS), a Python package designed for the implementation of pipelines that model the outputs of the data acquisition process from the three instruments on the LiteBIRD spacecraft: LFT (Low-Frequency Telescope), MFT (Mid-Frequency Telescope), and HFT (High-Frequency Telescope). LBS provides several modules to simulate the scanning strategy of the telescopes, the measurement of realistic polarized radiation coming from the sky (including the Cosmic Microwave Background itself, the Solar and Kinematic dipole, and the diffuse foregrounds emitted by the Galaxy), the generation of instrumental noise and the effect of systematic errors, like pointing wobbling, non-idealities in the Half-Wave Plate, et cetera. Additionally, we present the implementation of a simple but complete pipeline that showcases the main features of LBS. We also discuss how we ensured that LBS lets people develop pipelines whose results are accurate and reproducible. A full end-to-end pipeline has been developed using LBS to characterize the scientific performance of the LiteBIRD experiment. This pipeline and the results of the first simulation run are presented in Puglisi et al. (2025).",

The apparatus is configured to search for QCD axion dark matter, though also has the capability to detect axion-like particles (ALPs), dark photons, and some other forms of wave-like dark matter. Initially, a tuneable cylindrical oxygen-free copper cavity is read out using a low noise microwave amplifier feeding a heterodyne receiver. The cavity is housed in a dilution refrigerator and threaded by a solenoidal magnetic field, nominally 8T. The apparatus also houses a magnetic field shield for housing superconducting electronics, and several other fixed-frequency resonators for use in testing and commissioning various prototype quantum electronic devices sensitive at a range of axion masses in the range 2.0 to 40 micro-eV/c2. The apparatus as currently configured is intended as a test stand for electronics over the relatively wide frequency band attainable with the TM010 cavity mode used for axion searches. We present performance data for the resonator, dilution refrigerator, and magnet, and plans for the first science run.",

      "abstract": "A Systematic Review of Lagrange Points Applications in the Solar System Alan T. Dugger Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) This thesis conducts a systematic review of the applications of Lagrange points within the solar system, utilizing Systems Theory to frame these applications in terms of their interdependencies and potential for integration into broader space mission architectures. By analyzing various applications across domains such as astronomical research, space exploration, space resource utilizations, national defense, and space communication, this study identifies key areas where Lagrange points offer significant advantages. The research employs a qualitative analysis of existing literature combined with theoretical modeling to demonstrate how these points can be optimally utilized in future space missions. The finding suggests that a Systems Theory approach not only clarifies the roles and benefits of Lagrange points in space mission design but also reveals new pathways for enhancing mission efficiency and effectiveness. This thesis underscores the importance of a holistic view in the strategic planning of space missions and provides a foundational approach for integrating Lagrange points into future exploratory and operational frameworks.",

Comments welcome at sukrit@arizona.edu Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has begun to spectrally characterize small exoplanets orbiting M-dwarf stars, but interpretation of these spectra is ambiguous, with stellar, instrumental, or atmospheric origins possible for apparent spectral features. Consequently, interpretation of JWST small exoplanet spectra follows a Bayesian approach, with less theoretically plausible interpretations facing a higher burden of proof. Here, we use photochemical modeling to evaluate the plausibility of warm exo-Titans, exoplanets with N$_2$-CH$_4$ atmospheres analogous to Titan but orbiting closer to their host stars. Consideration of warm exo-Titans is motivated by arguments from planet formation, as well as tentative evidence from observations. Using TRAPPIST-1e as a case study, we show that the higher instellation experienced by warm exo-Titans reduces their CH$_4$ lifetime $\\tau_{\\text{CH}_{4}}$ relative to true Titan by orders of magnitude, reducing the probability of observing them. We constrain the $\\tau_{\\text{CH}_{4}}$ on a warm exo-Titan to be $\\leq0.1\\times$ (and most likely $\\leq0.02\\times$) true Titan, implying the absolute probability of detecting a warm exo-Titan is $<0.1$ and likely $<0.01$. This finding is consistent with recent JWST nondetections of CH$_4$-dominated atmospheres on warm terrestrial exoplanets. The low prior probability means that the standard of proof required to claim a warm exo-Titan detection is high, and we offer specific suggestions towards such a standard of proof. Observation of oxidized carbon species would corroborate a putative warm exo-Titan detection. Confirmed detection of warm exo-Titans would signal the need to fundamentally rethink our understanding of the structure, dynamics, and photochemistry of Titan-like worlds.",

Yet, the processes driving oceanic flows beneath its ice shell, as well as the factors controlling the thickness of this ice, remain incompletely understood. One especially distinctive feature of Europa is that its salty ocean is electrically conducting and thus influenced by Jupiter's time-varying magnetic field, which is believed to drive a large-scale zonal flow. Here, we examine hos this magnetically-induced jet affects both the heat flux and the dynamics of the convective flow within Europa's ocean. We first show that the magnetically-driven jet efficiently transports heat in stably stratified regions near the top of the ocean, and may alter the expected convective scaling laws in deeper layers. Second, by analysing the latitudinal distribution of heat flux and relating it to ice-thickness variations, we make predictions that can be compared with current observations. In anticipation of the upcoming JUICE and Europa Clipper missions, we discuss how improved measurement precision could help further constrain the ocean's properties and refine our model-based forecasts.",

Previous studies have examined a wide range of possible compositions, focusing primarily in the near-infrared (0.8-5.2 $\\mu$m) or mid-infrared (5-12 $\\mu$m) wavelengths. We present a new interpretation of K2-18b's JWST transit spectra, combining an independent reduction of MIRI LRS data with previously published NIRISS/NIRSpec observations. We assess the impact of stellar parameter uncertainties on the inferred planetary properties and, using revised stellar parameters, derive a planetary density of $\\rho_P = 3.34 \\pm 1.44$ g cm$^{-3}$. We consider scattering and absorption from laboratory-produced haze analogues and perform free-chemistry Bayesian retrievals informed by equilibrium chemistry. Our results are consistent with an H$_2$-dominated mini-Neptune atmosphere with a mean molecular weight of $\\mu \\sim$2.4 Daltons, and support the presence of hydrocarbon hazes across 0.85-12 $\\mu$m without requiring instrumental offsets. Our retrieved CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ abundances are broadly consistent between models but systematically lower than in haze-free studies, suggesting that haze reduces the need for high-$\\mu$ solutions. While our retrievals tend to favour atmospheric temperatures $\\sim$100-200 K warmer than previously reported, cooler solutions ($\\sim$250 K) remain viable if the planetary mass is reduced towards the lower end of its uncertainty. We emphasise the need for follow-up self-consistent photochemical and microphysical modelling, alongside further mid-infrared observations to constrain key hydrocarbon species.",

Ho, Renyue Cen, Shenzhen Xu 17 pages, 11 figures; submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The inner regions of protoplanetary disks are host to the sublimation of dust grains, a process traditionally modeled using equilibrium thermodynamics. We demonstrate through ab-initio density functional theory (DFT) and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations that silicate dust sublimation is inherently a non-equilibrium kinetic process. The binding energies and vibrational frequencies governing desorption, calculated for MgSiO3 and other compositions, reveal that sublimation timescales far exceed local dynamical times, allowing grains to persist in a superheated state. This kinetic inhibition results in a broad, dynamic sublimation front whose location and morphology are strongly regulated by radial advection and dust coagulation. Our coupled simulations, integrating sublimation with advection and grain evolution, show that the front varies radially by a factor of four with accretion rate and exhibits a vertically stratified, bowl-shaped structure. These findings imply that the inner disk dust distribution, thermal structure, and subsequent planet formation are profoundly influenced by the kinematics and kinetics of dust grains, necessitating a departure from equilibrium prescriptions in disk models and interpretations of inner rim observations.",

Howard, Howard Isaacson, Benjamin J. Fulton, Fei Dai 18 pages, 5 figures, accepted to AJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The ``Neptunian ridge'' is a recently identified peak in the frequency of planets with sizes between that of Neptune and Saturn orbiting their host stars with periods between 3 and 6 days (A. Castro-González et al. 2024). These planets may have formed similarly to their larger, hot Jupiter counterparts in the ``three-day pile-up'', through a dynamically excited migration pathway. The distribution of stellar obliquities in hot Neptune systems may therefore provide a vital clue as to their origin. We report a new stellar obliquity measurement for TOI-2374\\,b, a planet in the Neptunian ridge ($P = 4.31$ days, $R_p = 7.5 R_\\oplus$). We observed a spectroscopic transit of TOI-2374 b with the Keck Planet Finder, detecting the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) anomaly with an amplitude of 3 m/s, and measured a sky-projected obliquity of $\\lambda = {81^\\circ}^{+23^\\circ}_{-22^\\circ}$, indicating an orbit significantly misaligned with the spin axis of its host star. A reloaded RM analysis of the cross-correlation functions confirms this misalignment, measuring $\\lambda = {65^\\circ}^{+32^\\circ}_{-24^\\circ}$. Additionally, we measured a stellar rotation period of $P_\\mathrm{rot} = 26.4^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$ days with photometry from the Tierras observatory, allowing us to deduce the three-dimensional stellar obliquity of $\\psi = {85.9^\\circ}^{+8.6^\\circ}_{-9.2^\\circ}$. TOI-2374 b joins a growing number of hot Neptunes on polar orbits. The high frequency of misaligned orbits for Neptunian ridge and desert planets, compared with their longer period counterparts, is reminiscent of patterns seen for the giant planets and may suggest a similar formation mechanism.",

Simulation codes available on this https URL Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Small bodies in our Solar System are considered remnants of their early formation. Studying their physical and dynamic properties can provide insights into their evolution, stability, and origin. ESA's Rosetta mission successfully landed and studied comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) for approximately two years. In this work, the aim is to analyze the surface and orbital dynamics of comet 67P in detail, using a suitable 3-D polyhedral shape model. We applied the polyhedron method to calculate dynamic surface characteristics, including geometric height, surface tilt, surface slopes, geopotential surface, acceleration surface, escape speed, equilibrium points, and zero-velocity curves. The results show that the gravitational potential is predominant on the comet's surface due to its slow rotation. The escape speed has the maximum value in the Hapi region (the comet's neck). The surface slopes were analyzed to predict possible regions of particle motion and accumulation. The results show that most regions of the comet's surface have low slopes. Furthermore, we analyzed the slopes under the effects of Third-Body gravitational and Solar Radiation Pressure perturbations. Our results showed that the effects of Third-Body perturbations do not significantly affect the global behavior of slopes. Meanwhile, the Solar Radiation Pressure does not significantly affect particles across the surface of comet 67P with sizes $>\\sim10^{-3}$\\,cm at apocenter and $>\\sim10^{-1}$\\,cm at pericenter. We also identified four equilibrium points around comet 67P and one equilibrium point inside the body, where points E$_2$ and E$_5$ are linearly stable. In addition, we approximated the shape of comet 67P using the simplified Dipole Segment Model to study its dynamics, employing parameters derived from its 3-D polyhedral shape model. We found 12 families of planar symmetric periodic orbits around the body.",

Nielsen, Lorena Acuña-Aguirre, Alex Cridland 12 pages, 9 figures, resubmitted to A&A after first referee report' Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Under the core-accretion model, gas giants form via runaway accretion. This process starts when the mass of the accreted envelope becomes equal to the mass of the core. Here, we model a population of warm sub-Saturns to search for imprints of their formation history in their internal structure. Using the GAS gianT modeL for Interiors (GASTLI), we calculate a grid of interior structure models on which we perform retrievals for our sample of 28 sub-Saturns to derive their envelope mass fractions ($f_{env}$). For each planet, we run three different retrievals assuming low (-2.0 < log(Fe/H) < 0.5), medium ( 0.5 < log(Fe/H) < 1.4), and high (1.4 < log(Fe/H) < 1.7) atmospheric metallicity. The distribution of $f_{env}$ in our sample is then compared to predictions of planet formation models. When compared to the outcomes of a planetesimal accretion model, we find that we require medium to high atmospheric metallicities to reproduce the simulated planet population. Additionally, we find a bimodal distribution of $f_{env}$ in our sample with a gap that is located at different values of $f_{env}$ for different atmospheric metallicities. For the high atmospheric metallicity case, the gap in the $f_{env}$ distribution is located between 0.5 and 0.7, which is consistent with assumptions by the core-accretion model where runaway accretion starts when $M_{env} \\approx M_{core}$ ($f_{env} \\sim 0.5$). We also find a bimodal distribution of the hydrogen and helium mass fraction ($f_{H/He}$) with a gap at $f_{H/He} = 0.3$. The location of this gap is independent of the assumed atmospheric metallicity. Lastly, we compare the distributions of our sub-Saturns in the Neptunian savanna to a population of sub-Saturns in the Neptune desert and ridge. We find that the observed $f_{env}$ distribution of savanna and ridge sub-Saturns is consistent with the planets coming from the same underlying population.",

Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The current populations trapped in Neptune's main mean motion resonances in the Kuiper belt, Plutinos in the 3:2 and Twotinos in the 2:1, contain some of the best-characterized minor objects in the Solar System, given their dynamical importance. In particular, Twotinos may hide evidence of Neptune's early migration. However, these populations vary in time, declining at a rate that has not been previously clearly established. In this work, we use numerical simulations to study the long-term evolution of the Plutino and Twotino populations. We use two data sources: the most up-to-date observations and the theoretical debiased model of the Kuiper belt known as L7. In addition to studying the giant planets' effect on these populations over 4 Gyr, we analyze the additional impact produced by the ten most massive trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) trapped in these resonances, as well as the effect of Pluto on the 2:1 population. We find that the decay rate in each resonance can be modeled as a stochastic process well described by an exponential decay with an offset determined by an underlying long-term stable population. The most massive TNOs, particularly Pluto, influence this decay rate significantly, as expected for the 3:2 resonance. Remarkably, Pluto also strongly influences the 2:1 resonance's evolution.",

Published in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The obliquity between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbit, detected via the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, is a tracer of the formation history of planetary systems. While obliquity measurements have been extensively applied to hot Jupiters and short-period planets, they remain rare for cold and long-period planets due to observational challenges, particularly their long transit durations. We report the detection of the RM effect for the 19-hour-long transit of HIP 41378 f, a temperate giant planet on a 542-day orbit, observed through a worldwide spectroscopic campaign. We measure a slight projected obliquity of 21 $\\pm$ 8 degrees and a significant 3D spin-orbit angle of 52 $\\pm$ 6 degrees, based on the measurement of the stellar rotation period. HIP 41378 f is part of a 5-transiting planetary system with planets close to mean motion resonances. The observed misalignment likely reflects a primordial tilt of the stellar spin axis relative to the protoplanetary disk, rather than dynamical interactions. HIP 41378 f is the first non-eccentric long-period (P>100 days) planet observed with the RM effect, opening new constraints on planetary formation theories. This observation should motivate the exploration of planetary obliquities across a longer range of orbital distances through international collaboration.",
