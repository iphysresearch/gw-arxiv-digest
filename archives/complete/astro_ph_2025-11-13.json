Linear Floquet analysis and nonlinear simulations show that $\\phi$ fluctuations grow by parametric resonance, while $\\chi$ undergoes tachyonic bursts. The GW spectrum features two peaks: a dominant low-frequency peak from the parametric channel and a subdominant high-frequency peak from the tachyonic channel. Redshifted to today, the peak reaches $h^{2}\\Omega_{\\rm GW}^{(0)} \\sim 10^{-11}$ at $f^{(0)}_{p} \\sim 10^{7}$ Hz. This multi-peak structure is a characteristic imprint of trilinear preheating in $\\alpha$-attractors.",

By combining inferences for the binary component masses and luminosity distances from individual observations, it is possible to infer $H_0$ without direct electromagnetic counterparts or galaxy catalogs. However, this relies on theoretical gravitational-wave models, which are known to be incomplete descriptions of the full predictions of general relativity. Although the accuracy of our models are improving, they are also becoming increasingly expensive as additional phenomena are incorporated. In this work, we demonstrate that there is no significant advantage in including spin-precession and higher-order multipole moments when inferring $H_0$ via the mass spectrum method for current and near-future gravitational-wave event numbers. Even when simulating a population of highly precessing and preferentially asymmetric-mass-ratio binaries, we show that the inferred $H_0$ posterior changes minimally. Using a simpler, less accurate model, achieves comparable $H_0$ estimates with six times less computational cost (on average). Using computationally cheaper models for single event inference may become crucial as thousands of gravitational-wave observations are expected to be detected in the near future.",

The planned observatories will utilize electro-optic modulators (EOMs) to encode the onboard clock timing onto the beam phase. Recent research has demonstrated the advantage of introducing an optical frequency comb (OFC) in the metrology system with the modified framework of time-delay interferometry (TDI): the removal of the EOM and the simultaneous suppression of the stochastic jitter of the laser and the clock in the observation band. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach with the OFC-based metrology system. We report that after proper treatment, it is possible to use the measured carrier-carrier heterodyne frequencies to monitor the time derivative of the pseudoranges, which represent the physical light travel time and the clock difference. This approach does not require changing the existing TDI framework, as previous OFC based efforts did. We also present the experimental demonstration of our scheme using two separate systems to model two spacecraft. Using this novel approach, we synchronize the two independent phase measurement systems with an accuracy better than 0.47 ns, while the stochastic jitter in the observation band is suppressed down to the setup sensitivity around the LISA performance levels at 15 pm/sqrt(Hz).",

Photon four-momenta $k^\\mu$ and polarization four-vectors $f^\\mu$ are advanced using a fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme with cached Christoffel symbols, maintaining the constraints $u\\cdot f=0$ and $n\\cdot f=0$, where $u^\\mu$ is the ZAMO four-velocity and $n^\\mu$ is the disk normal, while keeping $k\\cdot f \\simeq 0$. A physically motivated gauge is enforced by projecting the polarization into the local zero-angular-momentum observer (ZAMO) screen at every substep, ensuring numerical stability of the orthogonality constraints. Accuracy and performance are benchmarked over a representative grid in spin, inclination, image-plane azimuth, and radius. The method comfortably meets IXPE and NICER polarization tolerances and approaches EHT requirements.

Yu-Long Yan, Quan Cheng, Xiao-Ping Zheng, Xiao-Yue Yu High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Newborn magnetars are important gravitational wave sources due to their ultra-strong magnetic fields and fast spins, and the entire population in the Universe may significantly contribute to the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). In this work, we investigate the SGWB from newborn magnetars and assess its detectability by the advanced LIGO (aLIGO) and Einstein Telescope (ET) based on three typical formation mechanisms of magnetars, i.e., the $\\alpha-\\Omega$ dynamo, convective dynamo, and magnetic flux conservation. For the two dynamo scenarios, when calculating the SGWB, we creatively incorporate the anti-correlations between the magnetic fields and initial spin periods $P_{\\rm i}$ with the initial dipole-field distribution of newborn magnetars. For the flux-conservation scenario, a bimodal lognormal form is adopted to describe the distribution of initial dipole fields, and all magnetars are assumed to have the same $P_{\\rm i}$. Our results show that the SGWB from newborn magnetars may be undetectable by the aLIGO and ET if the magnetars are formed due to these mechanisms since the signal-to-noise ratio of the SGWB with respect to the ET for an observation time of one year is only 0.37 for the $\\alpha-\\Omega$ dynamo, $3\\times10^{-4}$ for the convective dynamo, and at most 0.21 for the flux conservation.",

From each representation, we compute four entropy measures -- Shannon, exponential, Rényi, and Tsallis -- and apply three feature selection methods to identify the most informative features. We then train machine-learning classifiers on these features to compare the performance of different methodological combinations. We find that the combination of Rényi entropy from the wavelet domain and the Relief-F selection method yields the most effective discrimination among different gravitational-wave signals.",

Green, Miguel Zumalacárregui Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Gravitational waves (GWs) propagating through the universe can be microlensed by stellar and intermediate-mass objects. Lensing induces frequency-dependent amplification of GWs, which can be computed using \\texttt{GLoW}, an accurate code suitable for evaluating this factor for generic lens models and arbitrary impact parameters depending on the lens configuration. For parameter inference, we employ the DINGO algorithm, a machine learning framework based on neural posterior estimation, a simulation-based inference method that uses normalizing flows to efficiently approximate posterior distributions of the physical parameters. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that it enables efficient parameter estimation of diffracted GW signals using an isolated point mass lens model. This method can be useful for rapidly identifying microlensed events within large GW catalogs and for conducting population studies of compact binaries. Compared to traditional parameter estimation techniques, we find that combining DINGO with importance sampling can provide efficient estimation of the background Bayes-factor distribution, which is required in evaluating the significance of candidate lensed events. However, for foreground (lensed) events, care must be taken, as sampling efficiency can decrease when the lensed data lie outside the distribution learned by the unlensed DINGO network. Our framework can be naturally extended to more complex and realistic lens models, allowing detailed analyses of the microlensed GWs.",

Using simulated datasets consistent with current SN-Ia measurements, we explore how uncertainties in photometric calibration, intergalactic dust, progenitor evolution in luminosity and light-curve stretch, and intrinsic color scatter affect the inferred dark energy equation of state parameters (w0, wa). We test the Generalised Scale Factor (GEN) evolution and benchmark it against three time-evolving dark energy models; namely Chevallier Polarski Linder (CPL), Jassal Bagla Padmanabhan (JBP) and Logarithmic (LOG) parametrizations; comparing their sensitivity to these systematic effects. Calibration biases and progenitor evolution emerge as the dominant sources of uncertainty, while simpler parametrisations, viz. GEN, which directly describes the expansion rate, remains relatively stable under all systematic injections, unlike CPL, JBP and LOG that rely on the dark energy equation of state. These findings underscore the need for sub-per cent calibration precision and enhanced astrophysical modelling to ensure the robustness of dark energy inferences from current and future SN-Ia cosmology experiments.",

Updated discussions on nonlinearities near the phase-transition mass, GW170817, and perturbation amplitudes; new Fig. 3. Accepted in Physical Review Letters High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) During the late stages of a binary neutron star inspiral, dynamical tides induced in each star by its companion become significant and should be included in complete gravitational-wave (GW) modeling. We investigate the coupling between the tidal field and quasi-normal modes in hybrid stars and show that the discontinuity mode ($g$-mode) - intrinsically associated with first-order phase transitions and buoyancy - contributes non-negligibly compared with the fundamental $f$-mode. We find that the $g$-mode overlap integral can reach up to $\\sim 10\\%$ of the $f$-mode value for hybrid star masses in the range 1.4-2.0$M_{\\odot}$, with the largest values generally associated with larger density jumps. This leads to a GW phase shift due to the $g$-mode of $\\Delta \\phi_g \\lesssim 0.1$-$1$ rad (i.e., up to $\\sim5\\%-10\\%$ of $\\Delta \\phi_f$), with the largest shifts occurring for masses near the phase transition. At higher masses, the shifts remain smaller and nearly constant, with $\\Delta \\phi_g \\lesssim 0.1$ rad (roughly $\\sim 1\\%$ of $\\Delta \\phi_f$). These GW shifts may be relevant even at the design sensitivity of current second-generation GW detectors in the most optimistic cases. Moreover, if a $g$-mode is present and lies near the $f$-mode frequency, neglecting it in the GW modeling can lead to systematic biases in neutron star parameter estimation, resulting in radius errors of up to $1\\%-2\\%$.

This dark-matter environment induces oscillatory gravitational potentials that perturb the orbit of the binary, leaving an imprint in the binary's binding energy, and thus, on the gravitational waves emitted. We here compute the effect of this environment on the gravitational-wave phase using the stationary-phase approximation within the post-Newtonian formalism. We then perform a Fisher analysis to estimate the detectability of this environmental effect with a four-year LISA observation, focusing on vector fields with ultra-light masses in the $(10^{-19}, 10^{-16}) \\; \\rm{eV}$ range. We conclude that the observation of such gravitational waves with space-borne interferometers, like LISA, could yield a measurement or constraint on local, vector dark-matter environments, provided the dark-matter density is larger than roughly $10^{14} \\rm{M}_\\odot/{\\rm{pc}}^3$.",

      "abstract": "A theoretical prediction for the dipole in nearby distances using cosmography Hayley J. Macpherson, Asta Heinesen 20 pages, 11 figures, Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Cosmography is a widely applied method to infer kinematics of the Universe at small cosmological scales while remaining agnostic about the theory of gravity at play. Usually cosmologists invoke the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric in cosmographic analyses, however generalised approaches allow for analyses outside of any assumed geometrical model. These methods have great promise to be able to model-independently map the cosmic neighborhood where the Universe has not yet converged to isotropy. In this regime, anisotropies can bias parameter inferences if they are not accounted for, and thus must be included for precision cosmology analyses, even when the principle aim is to infer the background cosmology. In this paper, we develop a method to predict the dipole in luminosity distances that arises due to nearby inhomogeneities. This is the leading-order correction to the standard isotropic distance-redshift law. Within a very broad class of general-relativistic universe models, we provide an interpretation of the dipole in terms of the gradients in expansion rate and density which is free from any underlying background cosmology. We use numerical relativity simulations, with improved initial data methods, alongside fully relativistic ray tracing to test the power of our prediction. We find our prediction accurately captures the dipole signature in our simulations to within ~10% for redshifts $z\\lesssim 0.07$ in reasonably smooth simulations. In the presence of more non-linear density fields, we find this reduces to $z\\lesssim 0.02$. This represents up to an order of magnitude improvement with respect to what is achieved by naive, local cosmography-based predictions. Our paper thus addresses important issues regarding convergence properties of anisotropic cosmographic series expansions that would otherwise limit their applicability to very narrow redshift ranges.",

This probe can not only reveal previously inaccessible binaries, black holes, and other compact objects, but also can detect exoplanets through their imprint on GW signals, thereby significantly extend current exoplanet surveys. To date, nearly 6000 exoplanets have been confirmed, yet most of them reside either in the solar neighbourhood or along the sightline toward the Galactic bulge, reflecting the range limits of traditional electromagnetic techniques. In this work, we follow the method proposed in this http URL&this http URL(2019) to investigate frequency modulations in GW signals from early-stage binary neutron stars (BNSs) induced by circumbinary planets (CBPs) and obtain that CBPs can be detected by the future space-borne detector DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO). For BNS system with the masses of two components both being 1.4 $M_{\\odot}$, DECIGO could detect CBPs with mass being dozens of times that of Jupiter out to distances of $\\sim 1$ Gpc, well beyond the Local Supercluster, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study planetary formation and evolution for the post main-sequence stage.",

Barker 9 pages, 1 figure (+1 figure in appendix) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Gravitational-wave detectors can probe the existence of dark matter with exquisite sensitivity. Here, we perform a search for three kinds of dark matter -- dilatons (spin-0), dark photons (spin-1) and tensor bosons (spin-2) -- using three independent methods on the first part of the most recent data from the fourth observing run of LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA. Each form of dark matter could have interacted with different standard-model particles in the instruments, causing unique differential strains on the interferometers. While we do not find any evidence for a signal, we place the most stringent upper limits to-date on each of these models. For scalars with masses between $[4\\times 10^{-14},1.5\\times 10^{-13}]$ eV that couple to photons or electrons, our constraints improve upon those from the third observing run by one order of magnitude, with the tightest limit of $\\sim 10^{-20}\\,\\text{GeV}^{-1}$ at a mass of $\\sim2\\times 10^{-13}\\text{ eV}$. For vectors with masses between $[7\\times 10^{-13},8.47\\times 10^{-12}]$ eV that couple to baryons, our constraints supersede those from MICROSCOPE and Eöt-Wash by one to two orders of magnitude, reaching a minimum of $\\sim 5\\times 10^{-24}$ at a mass of $\\sim 10^{-12}$ eV. For tensors with masses of $[4\\times 10^{-14},8.47\\times 10^{-12}]$ eV (the full mass range analyzed) that couple via a Yukawa interaction, our constraints surpass those from fifth-force experiments by four to five orders of magnitude, achieving a limit as low as $\\sim 8\\times 10^{-9}$ at $\\sim2\\times 10^{-13}$ eV. Our results show that gravitational-wave interferometers have become frontiers for new physics and laboratories for direct multi-model dark-matter detection.",

GR was created by A. Einstein in 1915. In 1917 Einstein proposed the first (static) cosmological model. Soon after the A. Eddington proved that the model is unstable therefore it can not be realizable in nature. In 1922 and 1924 A. A. Friedmann found non-stationary solutions for cosmological equations written in the framework of GR. In 1927 G. Lemaitre obtained very similar results and, in addition, he derived the Hubble law (E. Hubble obtained this law from observations). Unfortunately, G. Lemaitre published his paper in not very popular Belgium journal. In 1931 Lemaitre proposed the first version of hot Universe model (he called it hypothesis of the primeval atom). In his book Lemaitre predicted even a background radiation as a signature of his model. One of the important property of the Lemaitre -- Gamow model was a prediction of CMB radiation with a temperature around a few K. It was recalled that the discovery of CMB radiation was done by T. Shmaonov in 1956 and his paper was published in 1957 (several years before Penzias and Wilson). In 1965, 1970 E. B. Gliner proposed vacuum like equation of matter which could correspond to exponential explosion of the Universe which was later called inflation. For decades in USSR, Friedmann's cosmological non-stationary models were treated as purely mathematical results without cosmologocal applications. On September 16, 1925 passed away untimely and it would be reasonable to remind today his great contribution in physical cosmology since the authors of book on Friedmann wrote that \"similarly to Copernicus who forced the Earth to move Friedmann forced the Universe to expand\".",

Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a measurement of the free-streaming length of dark matter (DM) and subhalo abundance around 28 quadruple image strong lenses using observations from JWST MIRI presented in Paper III of this series. We improve on previous inferences on DM properties from lensed quasars by simultaneously reconstructing extended lensed arcs with image positions and relative magnifications (flux ratios). Our forward modeling framework generates full populations of subhalos, line-of-sight halos, and globular clusters, uses an accurate model for subhalo tidal evolution, and accounts for free-streaming effects on halo abundance and concentration. Modeling lensed arcs leads to more-precise model-predicted flux ratios, breaking covariance between subhalo abundance and the free-streaming scale parameterized by the half-mode mass $m_{\\rm{hm}}$. Assuming subhalo abundance predicted by the semi-analytic model {\\tt{galacticus}} (N-body simulations), we infer (Bayes factor of 10:1) $m_{\\rm{hm}} < 10^{7.4} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ ($m_{\\rm{hm}} < 10^{7.2} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$), a 0.4 dex (0.3 dex) improvement relative to omitting lensed arcs. These bounds correspond to lower limits on thermal relic DM particle masses of $7.4$ and $8.4$ keV, respectively. Conversely, assuming DM is cold, we infer a projected mass in subhalos ($10^6 < m/M_{\\odot}<10^{10.7}$) of $1.6_{-1.1}^{+2.4} \\times 10^7 \\ \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} \\ \\rm{kpc^{-2}}$ at $95 \\%$ confidence. This is consistent with {\\tt{galacticus}} predictions ($0.6 \\times 10^7 \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} \\ \\rm{kpc^{-2}}$), but in tension with recent N-body simulations ($0.3 \\times 10^7 \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} \\ \\rm{kpc^{-2}}$). Our results are the strongest limits on WDM, and the most precise measurement of subhalo abundance around strong lenses. Further improvements will follow from the large sample of lenses to be discovered by Euclid, Rubin, and Roman.",

Weaverdyck Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present improved cosmological constraints from a re-analysis of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) 5-year sample of Type Ia supernovae (DES-SN5YR). This re-analysis includes an improved photometric cross-calibration, recent white dwarf observations to cross-calibrate between DES and low redshift surveys, retraining the SALT3 light curve model and fixing a numerical approximation in the host galaxy colour law. Our fully recalibrated sample, which we call DES-Dovekie, comprises $\\sim$1600 likely Type Ia SNe from DES and $\\sim$200 low-redshift SNe from other surveys. With DES-Dovekie, we obtain $\\Omega_{\\rm m} = 0.330 \\pm 0.015$ in Flat $\\Lambda$CDM which changes $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ by $-0.022$ compared to DES-SN5YR. Combining DES-Dovekie with CMB data from Planck, ACT and SPT and the DESI DR2 measurements in a Flat $w_0 w_a$CDM cosmology, we find $w_0 = -0.803 \\pm 0.054$, $w_a = -0.72 \\pm 0.21$. Our results hold a significance of $3.2\\sigma$, reduced from $4.2\\sigma$ for DES-SN5YR, to reject the null hypothesis that the data are compatible with the cosmological constant. This significance is equivalent to a Bayesian model preference odds of approximately 5:1 in favour of the Flat $w_0 w_a$CDM model. Using generally accepted thresholds for model preference, our updated data exhibits only a weak preference for evolving dark energy.",

Linder Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We clarify the role of the oft-misunderstood Null Energy Condition (NEC) in the context of the current cosmological data. In particular, the NEC implies the sum of the total energy density and pressure satisfies $\\rho_{tot}+P_{tot} \\ge 0$; the energy conditions do not apply separately to individual components of the cosmological fluid. Consequently, we show that under the current best-fit cosmological model no violation of the NEC takes place, past or future. Further, growth in the energy density of an individual component cannot be used to signal violation of the NEC. We illustrate these points with a worked example whereby misestimation of the matter density leads to a phase during which $\\rho_{de} + P_{de} < 0$ for the effective dark energy, followed by a phantom crossing and subsequent $\\rho_{de} + P_{de} > 0$. At no time is the NEC violated. We also introduce ``elephant'' and ``chimera'' classes of physics for crossing $w_{de}=-1$.",

Willams Anc folder contains supplementary materials Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present the full sample of measurements of the warm dust emission of 31 strongly-lensed, multiply imaged quasars, observed with JWST MIRI multiband imaging, which we use to constrain the particle properties of dark matter. The strongly lensed warm dust region of quasars is compact and statistically sensitive to a population of dark matter halos down to masses of $10^6$ M$_\\odot$. The high spatial resolution and infrared sensitivity of MIRI make it uniquely suited to measure multiply imaged warm dust emission from quasars and thus to infer the properties of low-mass dark halos. We use the measured flux ratios to test for a warm dark matter turnover in the halo mass function. To infer the dark matter parameters, we use a forward modeling pipeline which explores dark matter parameters while also accounting for tidal stripping effects on subhalos, globular clusters, and complex deflector macromodels with $m=1, m=3, \\text{ and } m=4$ elliptical multipole moments. Adopting a comparable prior on the projected density of substructure to our previous analyses, the data presented here provide a factor of 2 improvement in sensitivity to a turnover in the halo mass function. Assuming subhalo abundance predicted by the semi-analytic model galacticus we infer with a Bayes factor of 10:1, a half-mode mass $m_{\\rm{hm}} < 10^{7.8} M_{\\odot}$ (m>5.6 keV for a thermally produced dark matter particle). If instead we use a prior from N-body simulations, we infer $m_{\\rm{hm}} < 10^{7.5} M_{\\odot}$ (m>6.9 keV). This is one of the strongest constraints to date on a turnover on the halo mass function, and the flux ratios and inference methodology presented here can be used to test a broad range of dark matter physics.",

We adopt a unified framework capable of describing both relativistic and non-relativistic particles, as well as fast and slow decay regimes. Within this approach, we model exponential, power-law, oscillatory, and two-step decays, computing the resulting $\\mu$- and $y$-type distortions across the parameter space spanned by the confinement scale $a_c$, decay rate $\\Gamma_\\chi$, energy-transfer efficiency $\\Sigma_\\chi$, and velocity $v_{\\chi c}$. We find that power-law, oscillatory, and cascade decays can be effectively mapped onto exponential models with appropriate rescaling. The dominant factors controlling SDs are the decay epoch and lifetime, with $v_{\\chi c}$ becoming relevant only in the ultra-relativistic limit. FIRAS observations impose tight constraints on early energy injection, with $\\mu$-type distortions placing the strongest bounds on $\\Sigma_\\chi$. Simultaneous matching of both $\\mu_{\\rm firas}$ and $y_{\\rm firas}$ breaks the degeneracy between $\\Gamma_\\chi$ and $\\Sigma_\\chi$, localizing preferred decay rates around $\\Gamma_\\chi \\lesssim (3.3-4.4)\\times10^{-3}~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$ and $\\Sigma_\\chi \\lesssim 8.5\\times10^{-4}$ for relativistic particles, while fast decays with $\\Gamma_\\chi \\gtrsim 6.5~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$ become observationally negligible.

The China Space Station Telescope (CSST) will revolutionize this field by discovering up to $\\sim$100,000 galaxy-scale strong lenses, a huge increase over current samples. To harness the statistical power of this vast dataset, we forecast its cosmological constraining power using the gravitational-dynamical mass combination method. We create a realistic simulated lens sample and test how uncertainties in redshift and velocity dispersion measurements affect results under ideal, optimistic, and pessimistic scenarios. We find that increasing the sample size from 100 to 10,000 systems dramatically improves precision: in the $\\Lambda$CDM model, the uncertainty on the matter density parameter, $\\Omega_m$, drops from 0.2 to 0.01; in the $w$CDM model, the uncertainty on the dark energy equation of state, $w$, decreases from 0.3 to 0.04. With 10,000 lenses, our constraints on dark energy are twice as tight as those from the latest DESI BAO measurements. We also compare two parameter estimation techniques -- MultiNest sampling and Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling (BHM). While both achieve similar precision, BHM provides more robust estimates of intrinsic lens parameters, whereas MultiNest is about twice as fast. This work establishes an efficient and scalable framework for cosmological analysis with next-generation strong lensing surveys.",

Submitted to A&A, comments are welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Galaxy clusters can be used as powerful cosmological probes, provided one can obtain accurate mass estimates, which requires a precise knowledge of the underlying astrophysics of galaxy clusters. For these purposes, spatially resolved measurements of the thermodynamic properties of intra-cluster medium (ICM), such as density and temperature, are necessary. In particular, temperature estimates are traditionally obtained through spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy. Such measurements suffer from their sensitivity to the chosen energy calibration, may exhibit inherent biases, and are especially hard to perform at high redshift as they require deep observations. In recent years however, millimetre wavelength data with high spatial resolution, comparable to the one of current X-ray telescopes, have begun to be available. This has enabled the implementation of new methods to infer and map the cluster temperature in individual clusters, using the combination of density maps from X-ray data and pressure maps from millimetre data. In this paper, we present the first systematic validation of this approach on a large sample of synthetic clusters generated in The Three Hundred hydrodynamical simulations. We show that we are able to recover theoretical estimates of the temperature, namely the mass-weighted and spectroscopic-like temperatures, within biases of the order of $\\lesssim 1\\%$ in the best cases, up to $\\sim 10\\%$ in average, with scatters of the order of $10\\%$. To prepare the application of this approach to observed data, we discuss the modelling of the effective length $l_\\mathrm{eff}$, a key quantity necessary for the combination of X-ray and SZ projected data. In particular we provide templates calibrated on simulations for this quantity, and investigate their impact in the recovery of the temperature map, compared to other standard models.",

Using the COVMOS method, we generate 100\\,000 mock realisations of dark matter density fields in both real and redshift space across multiple redshifts and cosmological models. We derive an analytical framework linking the non-Gaussianity of the power spectrum distribution to higher-order statistics of the density field, including the trispectrum and pentaspectrum. We explore the effect of redshift-space distortions, the geometry of the survey, the Fourier binning, the integral constraint, and the shot noise on the skewness of the distribution of the power spectrum measurements. Our results demonstrate that the likelihood of the estimated matter power spectrum deviates significantly from a Gaussian assumption on nonlinear scales, particularly at low redshift. This departure is primarily driven by the pentaspectrum contribution, which dominates over the trispectrum at intermediate scales. We also examine the impact of the finiteness of the survey geometry in the context of the Euclid mission and find that both the shape of the survey and the integral constraint amplify the skewness.",

While hydrodynamical simulations accurately model the correlated properties of galaxies, they are computationally prohibitive to run over volumes that match modern surveys. We address this by developing a framework to rapidly generate mock galaxy catalogs conditioned on inexpensive dark-matter-only simulations. We present a multi-modal, transformer-based model that takes 3D dark matter density and velocity fields as input, and outputs a corresponding point cloud of galaxies with their physical properties. We demonstrate that our trained model faithfully reproduces a variety of galaxy summary statistics and correctly captures their variation with changes in the underlying cosmological and astrophysical parameters, making it the first accelerated forward model to capture all the relevant galaxy properties, their full spatial distribution, and their conditional dependencies in hydrosimulations.",

Comments welcome! Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We explore the cosmological signatures of neutrino and Hot Dark Matter (HDM) wakes, which refers to the preferential accumulation of neutrinos (or, more broadly, HDM particles) downstream of moving cold dark matter structures. We improve on existing theoretical models, and provide forecasts for the detectability of the effect in future surveys under more realistic conditions than previously considered in the literature. We show that neutrino and HDM wakes are unlikely to be ever observed with the most natural tracer of a hot subcomponent of the total dark matter on cosmological scales, i.e. 2D weak lensing surveys. However, the effect can be detected at a high significance with idealistic 3D maps of a tracer of HDM, for sufficiently small values of the effective free-streaming length (e.g. present-day values of $k_{\\textrm{fs},0} \\gtrsim 0.1\\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ to reach $\\textrm{SNR} \\gtrsim 1$, for a HDM species accounting for a percent of the total dark matter). HDM wakes are a smoking gun of the effects of free-streaming, which cannot be mimicked by changes to the background expansion history (such as allowing for the dark energy to be dynamical), and hence offer another avenue to search for massive neutrinos, and hot subcomponents of the total dark matter more broadly, in a way that complements traditional observables.",

We present a data-driven method to identify this region in galaxy clusters with masses $M_{200\\rm ,mean}>10^{13} M_{\\odot}$ at $z = 0$. Using resolved galaxy samples from the largest simulation volume of IllustrisTNG (TNG300-1), we examine how galaxy properties vary as a function of distance to the closest cluster. We train neural networks to classify galaxies into cluster and field galaxies based on their intrinsic properties. Using this classifier, we present the first quantitative and probabilistic map of the transition region. It is represented as a broad and intrinsically scattered region near cluster outskirts, rather than a sharp physical boundary. This is the physical detection of a mixed population. In order to determine transition regions of different physical processes by training property-specific models, we categorise galaxy properties based on their underlying physics, i.e. gas, stellar, and dynamical. Changes to the dynamical properties dominate the innermost regions of the clusters of all masses. Stellar properties and gas properties, on the other hand, exhibit transitions at similar locations for low mass clusters, yet gas properties have transitions in the outermost regions for high mass clusters. These results have implications for cluster environmental studies in both simulations and observations, particularly in refining the definition of cluster boundaries while considering environmental preprocessing and how galaxies evolve under the effect of the cluster environment.",

Wallbank Fiona Lopez et al 2025 ApJ 990 23 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The use of galaxy clusters to constrain cosmology is limited in part due to uncertainties in derived cluster masses, which often depend on the gas temperature. Unfortunately, there exists a longstanding discrepancy in temperature measurements of the same galaxy clusters made by the two most sensitive X-ray observatories, Chandra and XMM-Newton. The NuSTAR X-ray Observatory's greater sensitivity to the exponential turnover in the bremsstrahlung continuum allows for more precise and potentially more accurate galaxy cluster temperature estimates, especially given its unique ability to independently calibrate its optics in orbit. We present new NuSTAR spectra of 10 relaxed clusters ($5~\\mathrm{keV} < kT < 10~\\mathrm{keV}$), extracted from identical regions as previous spectra from Chandra and XMM-Newton. The 3--20~keV spectra are well fit by single temperature models, and fits done in narrower bandpasses provide no clear evidence in support of the existence of multi temperature gas. We find NuSTAR temperatures are typically $\\sim 15\\%$ higher than XMM-Newton temperatures. In contrast, good agreement is found between NuSTAR and Chandra temperatures for clusters with $kT \\lesssim 7~\\mathrm{keV}$, with Chandra measurements exceeding NuSTAR's in hotter systems. When more clusters are included, the trend is reinforced and can be extended to higher temperatures. A generic increase to Chandra's $E > 2~\\mathrm{keV}$ effective area ($\\sim 5\\%$ at 5~keV) is found to explain the trend reasonably well. These results demonstrate the potential for NuSTAR data to address the two-decade-old temperature discrepancy between Chandra and XMM-Newton.",

The discovery of Blue Monsters (i.e. ultracompact yet very bright high-z galaxies) and the Little Red Dots (i.e. very compact dustless strong Balmer break cosmic dawn sources) pose significant challenges to pre-JWST era models of the assembly of first stars and galaxies. In addition, JWST data further strengthen the problem posed by the origin of the supermassive black holes that power the most distant quasars observed. Stars powered by Dark Matter annihilation (i.e. Dark Stars) can form out of primordial gas clouds during the cosmic dawn era and subsequently might grow via accretion and become supermassive. In this paper we argue that Supermassive Dark Stars (SMDSs) offer natural solutions to the three puzzles mentioned above. Moreover, we present the best evidence so far, for the existence of SMDSs: the identification of a He~II$\\lambda$2511~Å absorption feature at $S/N\\sim4$ in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z13-0.",

Zannoni Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The search for relics from the inflation era in the form of B-mode polarization of the CMB is a major challenge in cosmology. The main obstacle appears to come from the complexity of Galactic foregrounds that need to be removed. Multi-frequency observations are key to mitigating their contamination and mapping primordial fluctuations. We present spectral-imaging, a method to reconstruct sub-frequency maps of the CMB polarization within the instrument's physical bandwidth, a unique feature of Bolometric Interferometry that could be crucial for foreground mitigation as it provides an increased spectral resolution. Our technique uses the frequency evolution of the shape of the Bolometric Interferometer's synthesized beam to reconstruct frequency information from the time domain data. We reconstruct sub-frequency maps using an inverse problem approach based on detailed modeling of the instrument acquisition. We use external data to regularize the convergence of the estimator and account for bandpass mismatch and varying angular resolution. The reconstructed maps are unbiased and allow exploiting the spectral-imaging capacity of QUBIC. Using end-to-end simulations of the QUBIC instrument, we perform a cross-spectra analysis to extract a forecast on the tensor-to-scalar ratio constraint of $\\sigma(r)= 0.0225$ after component separation.",

Muñoz 18 pages, 9 figures; minor additions made to match version published in PRD Phys. Rev. D 112, 083013 (2025) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Although it is commonly assumed that relativistic particles dominate the energy density of the universe quickly after inflation, a variety of well-motivated scenarios predict an early matter-dominated era (EMDE) before the onset of Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Subhorizon dark matter density perturbations grow faster during an EMDE than during a radiation-dominated era, leading to the formation of \"microhalos\" far earlier than in standard models of structure formation. This enhancement of small-scale structure boosts the dark-matter annihilation rate, which contributes to the heating of the intergalactic medium (IGM). We compute how the dark matter annihilation rate evolves after an EMDE and forecast how well measurements of the 21-cm background can detect dark matter annihilation in cosmologies with EMDEs. We find that future measurements of the global 21-cm signal at a redshift of $z\\sim 17$ are unlikely to improve on bounds derived from observations of the isotropic gamma-ray background, but measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum have the potential to detect dark matter annihilation following an EMDE. Moreover, dark matter annihilation and astrophysical X-rays produce distinct heating signatures in the 21-cm power spectrum at redshifts around 14, potentially allowing differentiation between these two IGM heating mechanisms.",

Here, we re-analyze the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from Ly$\\alpha$ absorption and quasar correlations using data from the extended Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) Data Release 16 (DR16), incorporating for the first time the memory of reionization in the Ly$\\alpha$ forest. Three distinct scenarios of reionization timeline are considered in our analyses. We find that the recovered BAO parameters ($\\alpha_\\parallel$, $\\alpha_\\perp$) remain consistent with the original eBOSS DR16 analysis. However, models incorporating reionization relics provide a better fit to the data, with a tantalizing preference for early reionization, consistent with recent findings from the James Webb Space Telescope. Furthermore, the inclusion of reionization relics significantly impacts the non-BAO parameters. For instance, we report deviations of up to $3\\sigma$ in the Ly$\\alpha$ redshift-space distortion parameter and $\\sim7\\sigma$ in the linear Ly$\\alpha$ bias for the late reionization scenario. Our findings suggest that the eBOSS Ly$\\alpha$ data is more accurately described by models that incorporate a broadband enhancement to the Ly$\\alpha$ forest power spectrum, highlighting the importance of accounting for reionization relics in cosmological analyses.",

Their low-density nature and vast extent make them especially sensitive to cosmological scenarios of the class $f(R)$, which incorporate screening mechanisms in dense, compact regions. Weak lensing (WL) by voids, in particular, provides a direct probe for testing MG scenarios. While traditional voids are identified from 3D galaxy positions, 2D voids detected in WL maps trace underdense regions along the line of sight and are sensitive to unbiased matter distribution. To investigate this, we developed an efficient pipeline for identifying and analyzing tunnel voids, i.e., underdensities detected in WL maps, specifically in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the convergence. In this work, we used this pipeline to generate realistic SNR maps from cosmological simulations featuring different $f(R)$ scenarios and massive neutrinos, comparing their effects against the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model. Using the convergence maps and the 2D void catalogs, we analyzed various statistics, including the probability density function, angular power spectrum, and void size function. We then focused on the tangential shear profile around 2D voids, demonstrating how the proposed void-finding algorithm maximizes the signal. We showed that MG leads to deeper void shear profiles due to the enhanced evolution of cosmic structures, while massive neutrinos have the opposite effect. Furthermore, we found that parametric functions typically applied to 3D void density profiles are not suitable for deriving the shear profiles of tunnel voids. We, therefore, proposed a new parametric formula that provides an excellent fit to the void shear profiles across different void sizes and cosmological models. Finally, we tested the sensitivity of the free parameters of this new formula to the cosmological model.",

Accurate IA modeling is essential for robust cosmological inference, but current approaches rely on perturbative methods that break down on nonlinear scales or on expensive simulations. We introduce IAEmu, a neural network-based emulator that predicts the galaxy position-position ($\\xi$), position-orientation ($\\omega$), and orientation-orientation ($\\eta$) correlation functions and their uncertainties using mock catalogs based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework. Compared to simulations, IAEmu achieves ~3% average error for $\\xi$ and ~5% for $\\omega$, while capturing the stochasticity of $\\eta$ without overfitting. The emulator provides both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, helping identify regions where predictions may be less reliable. We also demonstrate generalization to non-HOD alignment signals by fitting to IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation data. As a fully differentiable neural network, IAEmu enables $\\sim$10,000$\\times$ speed-ups in mapping HOD parameters to correlation functions on GPUs, compared to CPU-based simulations. This acceleration facilitates inverse modeling via gradient-based sampling, making IAEmu a powerful surrogate model for galaxy bias and IA studies with direct applications to Stage IV weak lensing surveys.",

To prepare for these upcoming measurements we study the redshift drift in detail using the relativistic N-body code $\\texttt{gevolution}$, focusing on inhomogeneity-induced fluctuations. Using a ray-tracer, we calculate the redshift drift directly from the light cone at two different time steps. To investigate observer-dependent biases we consider 10 different observers. We find that inhomogeneity-induced fluctuations in the redshift drift can in extreme cases be of the same order as the cosmic signal for $z\\lesssim0.15$. By comparing our results to first-order perturbation theory, we find that the extreme outliers are due to peculiar motion in over-densities and can be described by first-order perturbation theory to percent precision. We calculate angular power spectra that fit very well with our predictions based on perturbation theory at linear scales and show a surprisingly large non-linear signal. This shows that redshift drift not only has the power to measure the background expansion, but could also deliver information about the velocity and acceleration fields in clusters.",

Here, we constrain the 21-cm signal and infer IGM properties using the Population II galaxy parameters derived in a previous study through multi-wavelength synergies. This includes high-redshift UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), cosmic X-ray and radio backgrounds (CXB and CRB), the SARAS 3 global 21-cm signal non-detection, and HERA 21-cm power spectrum upper limits. From CXB and HERA data, we infer the IGM kinetic temperature to be $T_\\text{K}(z=15)\\lesssim 7.7~\\text{K}$, $2.5~\\text{K} \\lesssim T_\\text{K}(z=10) \\lesssim 66~\\text{K}$, and $20~\\text{K}\\lesssim T_\\text{K}(z=6) \\lesssim 2078~\\text{K}$ at 95% credible interval (C.I.). Similarly, CRB and HERA data limit the radio emission efficiency of galaxies, giving $T_\\text{rad}(z=15) \\lesssim 47~\\text{K}$, $T_\\text{rad}(z=10)\\lesssim 51~\\text{K}$, and $T_\\text{rad}(z=6)\\lesssim 101~\\text{K}$. These constraints, strengthened by UVLFs from HST and JWST, enable the first $\\textit{lower bound}$ on the cosmic 21-cm signal. We infer an absorption trough of depth ${-201~\\text{mK}\\lesssim T_\\text{21,min} \\lesssim -68~\\text{mK}}$ at $z_\\text{min}\\approx10-16$, and a power spectrum of $8.7~\\text{mK}^2 < \\Delta_{21}^2(z=15) < 197~\\text{mK}^2$ at $k=0.35~h\\text{Mpc}^{-1}$. Our results highlight the power of multi-wavelength synergies in constraining the early Universe. While promising for upcoming 21-cm experiments, the results depend on our assumption of a redshift-independent X-ray and radio efficiency of galaxies, and the exclusion of a flexible model for Population III stars.",

      "abstract": "Unified dark fluid with null sound speed as an alternative to phantom dark energy Raphaël Kou, Antony Lewis Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Recent BAO measurements from DESI, when combined with CMB and supernovae data, suggest evolving dark energy and in particular point to a possible phantom regime, with an equation of state parameter $w<-1$. We explore an alternative phenomenological way to model dark matter and dark energy based on a unified dark fluid (UDF). By construction, our model reproduces the same background expansion history as DESI's best-fit using the CPL parametrization, but assumes a vanishing rest-frame sound speed and no anisotropic stress. This simple prescription ensures a consistent and physical treatment of perturbations and, in our case, the use of a unified dark sector avoids phantom behaviour. We model CMB, LSS, and redshift-space distortion observables, and find mostly small differences with CPL, suggesting that while stage IV CMB and galaxy surveys will be able to test these models, achieving a decisive distinction between them may prove challenging on linear scales. At the non-linear level, we study spherical collapse in the UDF and show that within this framework, structure formation proceeds very similarly to standard scenarios. Using Planck, DESI BAO DR2, and DES Y5 supernovae data, we demonstrate that this simple UDF model fits current observations nearly as well as CPL, while treating perturbations consistently. Because most cosmological observations are not sensitive to how the dark sector is split, the unified framework can also approximate the phenomenology of interacting dark energy-dark matter scenarios or evolving dark matter, making it a general way to model the data, at least as long as the dark components have a vanishing sound speed, which is the most distinctive feature of our analysis. Our results highlight that a unified dark fluid with evolving equation of state and null sound speed is sufficient to pass current constraints without invoking a phantom component.",

To do this, we use weak lensing convergence maps from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 data, and construct corresponding galaxy convergence maps at $z\\lesssim1.0$, representing projected galaxy number density fluctuations weighted by lensing efficiency. The two maps show overall agreement. However, we could identify 22 regions where the dark matter density exhibits an excess compared to the galaxy density. After carefully examining the survey depths and proximity to survey boundaries, we select seven of the most probable candidates for dark structures. This sample provides valuable testbeds for further investigations into dark matter mapping. Moreover, our method will be very useful for future studies of dark structures as large-scale weak-lensing surveys become available, such as the $\\textit{Euclid}$ mission, the Vera C.

D (vol=112, issue=10, pages=103512, year=2025) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The gas density profile around galaxies, shaped by feedback and affecting the galaxy lensing signal, is imprinted on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (kSZ). We precisely measure this effect ($S/N\\approx 10$) via velocity stacking with more than 800,000 spectroscopically confirmed luminous red galaxies (LRG) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Y1 survey, which overlap with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 temperature maps over $\\geq$ 4,000 deg$^2$. We explore the kSZ dependence with various galaxy parameters and find no significant trend with redshift, but clear trends with stellar mass and absolute magnitude in $g$, $r$, and $z$ bands. Our analysis suggests that the gas extends beyond the dark matter halo (99.5\\% confidence, i.e. PTE = 0.005). We find a tentative preference for hydrodynamical simulation models with stronger feedback that drives gas further out (Illustris $z=0.5$, PTE = 0.37) over weaker-feedback cases (IllustrisTNG $z=0.8$, PTE = 0.045), though with limited statistical significance. In all cases, a free multiplicative amplitude was fit to the simulated profiles, and further modeling work is required to firm up these conclusions. We find consistency between kSZ profiles around spectroscopic and photometric LRG, with comparable statistical power, thus increasing our confidence in the photometric analysis. Additionally, we present the first kSZ measurement around DESI Y1 bright galaxy sample (BGS) and emission-line galaxies (ELG), whose features match qualitative expectations. Finally, we forecast $S/N \\sim 50$ for future stacked kSZ measurements using data from ACT, DESI Y3, and Rubin Observatory. These measurements will serve as an input for galaxy formation models and baryonic uncertainties in galaxy lensing.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Imaging of optical Galactic cirrus, the spatially resolved form of diffuse Galactic light, provides important insights into the properties of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) in the Milky Way. While previous investigations have focused mainly on the intensity characteristics of optical cirrus, their morphological properties remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employ several complementary statistical approaches -- local intensity statistics, angular power spectrum / $\\Delta$-variance analysis, and wavelet scattering transform analysis -- to characterize the morphology of cirrus in deep optical imaging data. We place our investigation of optical cirrus into a multi-wavelength context by comparing the morphology of cirrus seen with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array to that seen with space-based facilities working at longer wavelengths (Herschel 250 $\\mu m$, WISE 12 $\\mu m$, and Planck radiance), as well as with structures seen in the DHIGLS HI column density map. Our statistical methods quantify the similarities and the differences of cirrus morphology in all these datasets. The morphology of cirrus at visible wavelengths resembles that of far-infrared cirrus more closely than that of mid-infrared cirrus; on small scales, anisotropies in the cosmic infrared background and systematics may lead to differences. Across all dust tracers, cirrus morphology can be well described by a power spectrum with a common power-law index $\\gamma\\sim-2.9$. We demonstrate quantitatively that optical cirrus exhibits filamentary, coherent structures across a broad range of angular scales. Our results offer promising avenues for linking the analysis of coherent structures in optical cirrus to the underlying physical processes in the ISM that shape them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these morphological signatures can be leveraged to distinguish and disentangle cirrus from extragalactic light.",

Valerin High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We report observations of Type Ia SN 2021hem, discovered <48 hours of last non-detection, and located in an apparently hostless environment. With a peak absolute B-band magnitude of -19.96 mag, and a lack of secondary maximum in near-infrared and i-band light curves make it resemble 2003fg-like events. The slowly evolving light curves, and the earliest spectrum showing CII absorption lines, further support this classification. Fireball model fit to early light curves yields a time of first light of -16.43 days relative to B-band maximum. The first detection occurs 1.51 days before the onset of the fireball-like flux rise. This early emission, and $(g - r)_0$ color, is inconsistent with circumstellar or companion interaction. Instead, shallow $^{56}$Ni mixing or an asymmetric $^{56}$Ni distribution offers a plausible explanation. SN2021hem is the fifth known 2003fg-like SN with early-time excess flux emission. The estimated mass of radioactive $^{56}$Ni in SN2021hem is $1.00\\pm0.09 M_\\odot$. Deep GTC imaging obtained 2.5 yr after the explosion (with $m_{lim,r}=24.4$ mag and $\\mu_{lim,r} = 26.3\\rm~mag~arsec^{-2}$), reveals no coincident host, thereby ruling out most faint dwarf and UDGs. Alternatively, assuming the nearest plausible host galaxy, at a distance of 102 kpc, implies a hyper-velocity progenitor ejected at $\\sim$2200 km/s. A faint diffuse feature ~6 kpc from the SN site has also been detected in the image, with its surface brightness of a UDGs. However, it is unclear whether it is a galaxy and is associated with SN2021hem. Considering its large normalized directional light distance ($d_{DLR}\\sim3-4$) from SN, and its unusual elongation, it is a candidate of low probability to be the host galaxy of SN2021hem. These results identify SN2021hem as one of the strongest candidates for a hostless SN Ia, underscoring the diversity of luminous, slowly evolving, 2003fg-like explosions.",

Vlasyuk (SAO) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The physical mechanisms driving neutrino and electromagnetic flares in blazars remain poorly understood. We investigate a prominent multi-messenger flare in the quasar PKS 0446+11 to identify the processes responsible for its high-energy emission. We analyze the IceCube-240105A high-energy neutrino event together with contemporaneous observations in the gamma-ray, X-ray, optical, and radio bands. The on- and off-flare spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are modeled within a single-zone leptohadronic framework. Multi-epoch VLBA observations from the MOJAVE program provide parsec-scale polarization data that complement the multi-wavelength light curves. No significant time delay is detected between the neutrino arrival and the flares in different energy bands. This is consistent with an extremely small jet viewing angle below 1 deg, inferred from the parsec-scale polarization structure. The flare can be reproduced by the injection of a proton population and an increase of the Doppler factor from 18 to 24. We also detect an approximately 90 deg rotation of the EVPA in the parsec-scale core during the initial phase of the flare, indicating the emergence of a shock formed by the change in the bulk plasma speed. Our comprehensive multi-messenger analysis demonstrates that the extreme beaming and sub-degree viewing angle of this distant blazar can account for the observed neutrino and electromagnetic activity. These findings strengthen the case for blazars as efficient accelerators of hadrons and as significant contributors to the observed high-energy neutrino flux.",

Submitted to MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) In the nebular phase, supernovae are powered by radioactive decay and continuously fade, while their densities have decreased enough such that the expanding nebula becomes (largely) optically thin and the entire structure can be studied. Models for the nebular phase need to take Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) effects into account, while at the same time radiative transfer effects often cannot be ignored. To account for the asymmetric morphologies of SNe, 3D input ejecta models must be used. In this work, we present the \\texttt{ExTraSS} (EXplosive TRAnsient Spectral Simulator) code, which has been upgraded to be fully capable of 3D NLTE radiative transfer calculations in order to generate synthetic spectra for explosive transients in the nebular phase, with a focus on supernovae. We solve the long-standing difficulty of 3D NLTE radiative transfer -- to manage generation and storage of millions of photoexcitation rates over $\\sim10^{5}$ of cells -- by developing a new Domain Decomposition algorithm. We describe this new methodology and general code operations in detail, and verify convergence and accuracy.",

In this work, we use \\texttt{ExTraSS} (EXplosive TRAnsient Spectral Simulator) -- which was recently upgraded into a full 3D NLTE radiative transfer code (including photoionization and line-by-line transfer effects) -- to carry out such calculations. \\texttt{ExTraSS} is applied to a 3D explosion model of a $9.0\\,M_\\odot$ H-rich progenitor which is evolved into the homologous phase. Synthetic spectra are computed and the lines from different elements are studied for varying viewing angles. The model spectra are also compared against observations of SN 1997D and SN 2016bkv. The model is capable of creating good line profile matches for both SNe, and reasonable luminosity matches for He, C, O, and Mg lines for SN 1997D -- however H$\\alpha$ and Fe I lines are too strong.",

Lim, Tobias Frederico 15 pages, 5 tables, and 6 figures High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Neutron stars (NSs) provide a unique laboratory to probe dark matter (DM) through its gravitational imprint on stellar evolution. We use a two-fluid framework with non-annihilating, asymmetric DM, both fermionic and bosonic, that interacts with ordinary matter (OM) solely through gravity. Within this framework, we track proto-neutron stars (PNSs) across their thermal and compositional evolution via quasi-static modeling over the Kelvin--Helmholtz cooling timescale. We uncover a distinct thermal signature: DM cores deepen the gravitational potential, compressing and heating the baryonic matter, while extended DM halos provide external support, leading to cooling of the stellar matter. In contrast, hyperons and other exotic baryons soften the equation of state similarly to DM cores but reduce, rather than increase, the temperature. DM thus alters both temperature and particle distribution profiles in ways that provide a clear diagnostic of its presence. DM cores also enhance compactness and shift hyperon onset, with the strongest effects during deleptonization and neutrino-transparent phases due to reduced neutrino pressure contributions. Consequently, this early thermal evolution, observable through supernova neutrino light curves and young pulsar cooling curves, offers a direct, testable probe of DM in NSs.",

The source is located 0.4 degrees from the best-fit neutrino direction and satisfies selection criteria for VLBI-selected, radio-bright AGN that have been identified as highly probable neutrino associations. PKS 0446+11 exhibited a major gamma-ray flare in November 2023, reaching approximately 18x its 4FGL-DR4 catalog average. Around the neutrino epoch, PKS 0446+11 remained in an elevated state, with the gamma-ray flux more than six times above its catalog level, the X-ray flux an order of magnitude above the archival measurements, and the optical-UV emission also enhanced. We used Fermi-LAT, Swift-XRT/UVOT, and archival multi-wavelength data to construct multi-wavelength light curves and spectral energy distributions (SEDs). SED modeling shows that the emission is best described by a leptonic scenario, with synchrotron emission at low energies and external Compton scattering of broad-line region and dusty torus photons dominating the X-ray - gamma-ray output. A lepto-hadronic model fails to adequately reproduce the observed SED, although hadronic cascades can broadly account for the X-ray and gamma-ray spectral coverage at lower flux levels. We compute the expected neutrino flux for the hadronic scenario and compare it to the IceCube 90% upper limit. Our results highlight the importance of continued multi-wavelength and neutrino monitoring to better understand the physical conditions under which this blazar may serve as neutrino source.",

Wijers 28 pages, 12 figures; submitted to ApJL, comments are welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We introduce the PanRadio Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) program carried out on the Australia Telescope Compact Array: a systematic, multi-year, radio survey of all southern \\textit{Swift} GRB events, comprehensively following the multi-frequency evolution of their afterglows from within an hour to years post-burst. We present the results of the 400-day observing campaign following the afterglow of long-duration (collapsar) GRB~230815A, the first one detected through this program. Typically, GRB~230815A would not otherwise receive traditional radio follow-up, given it has no known redshift and lacks comprehensive multi-wavelength follow-up due to its high line-of-sight extinction with $A_V = 2.3$. We found its early X-ray jet break at ${\\sim}0.1$ days post-burst to be at odds with the evolution of the multi-frequency radio light curves that were traced over an unusually long duration of $400$ days. The radio light curves approximately evolved (with minor deviations) according to the standard self-similar expansion for a relativistic blast wave in a homogeneous environment prior to jet break, showing no evidence for evolution in the microphysical parameters describing the electron acceleration processes. We reconcile these features by proposing a two-component jet: the early X-ray break originates from a narrow component with a half-opening angle ${\\sim}2.1^{\\circ}$, while the evolution of the radio afterglow stems from a wider component with a half-opening angle $\\gtrapprox 35^{\\circ}$. The PanRadio GRB program will establish a sample of comprehensively followed GRBs, where a rigorous inspection of their microphysical and dynamical parameters can be performed, thereby revealing the diversity of features in their outflows and environments.",

Using realistic luminosity-dependent density evolution (LDDE) functions derived from observed gamma-ray luminosity functions for FSRQs and BL Lacs, we calculate the redshift evolution of the cosmic ray source population through integrated luminosity functions. The diffuse UHECRs flux from these sources is modelled by propagating nuclei through extragalactic space, including energy losses from interactions with cosmic photon backgrounds. The resulting UHECRs spectra are compared with observational data from the Pierre Auger Observatory and the Telescope Array, with fluxes normalised at reference energies. In addition to spectral comparisons, we generate HEALPix-based sky maps and identify potential hotspots. Near these hotspots, several galaxies and extragalactic sources are found, suggesting possible associations with the enhanced flux regions. Our results indicate that LDDE-modelled AGNs could contribute significantly to the observed diffuse UHECRs flux and provide constraints on their role as dominant sources.",

In this work, we adapt the physics-informed token transformer (PITT) network for multi-channel data and couple it with Fourier neural operator (FNO). The resulting PITT FNO network is trained for interpolation tasks on a dataset governed by the Euler equations. We compare the performance of our machine learning model with a linear interpolation baseline and show that it requires $\\sim6-10$ times less data to achieve the same mean square error of the interpolated quantities. Additionally, PITT FNO has excellent mass and energy conservation as a result of its physics-informed nature. We further discuss the ability of the network to recover fine detail using a spectral analysis. Our results suggest that loss of fine details is related to the decreasing correlation time of the data with increasing Fourier mode which cannot be resolved by simply increasing Fourier mode truncation in FNO.",

Revisiting the possibility of a hadron-quark FOPT from a new perspective, we examine the interplay between the coupled nature of gravity and microscopic interactions in Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations and the fundamental requirements of thermodynamic consistency in NSs. We demonstrate that a sharp FOPT manifested as a plateau in the equation of state (EOS) $P(\\varepsilon)$, i.e., pressure $P$ versus energy density $\\varepsilon$, is intrinsically incompatible with the regularity conditions of the TOV solutions. Although numerical integrations of the TOV equations with EOSs incorporating FOPTs may yield seemingly reasonable mass-radius relations consistent with current observations, such results can mask underlying inconsistencies. Our analysis thus establishes a structural consistency criterion for constraining dense-matter EOSs using NS observables, complementing existing studies of possible phase transitions in NS interiors.",

Inspired by the peculiar morphology of the Pa 30 nebula, we adopt a framework in which to characterize supernova remnants under different degrees of cooling. Our cooling framework characterizes remnants with a singular parameter called $\\beta$ that sets how rapidly the system's thermal energy is radiated or emitted away. A continuum of morphologies is created by the implementation of different cooling timescales. For $\\beta \\gtrsim 400$, or when the cooling timescale is shorter than $\\approx \\frac{1}{400}$ of the Sedov time, the ejecta is shaped into a filamentary structure similar to Pa 30. We explain the filament creation by the formation of Rayleigh-Taylor Instability fingers where cooling has prevented the Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability from overturning and mixing out the tips. The ejecta in these filaments have not decelerated and are moving almost completely ballistically at $\\approx 95-100\\%$ their free expansion speed. In this rapid cooling regime, an explosion energy $\\approx 3.5 \\times 10^{47}$ erg is inferred. We also propose the cooling mechanism required to create these structures necessitates removing energy at a rate of $2\\%$ of $E_{\\rm ej}/t$, which implies a cooling luminosity of $\\approx 10^{36}$ erg/s.",

Existing age-dating techniques are limited in terms of both the spectral type and age range they can accurately probe, and many are unreliable for stars older than 1 Gyr. Recent studies have suggested that a star's X-ray luminosity correlates strongly with stellar age and shows a steep fall-off at ages older than 1 Gyr. In this work, we present X-ray luminosity relationship values from eROSITA for four previously unassessed stars. Additionally, we reassess the X-ray luminosity/age relationship present in 24 main-sequence stars older than a gigayear. We confirm that a correlation does appear to exist between stellar age and X-ray luminosity at ages older than 1 Gyr. However, we measure a shallower slope with age than previous research for older stars, similar to what was found for younger stars. We also find evidence for significant astrophysical variability in a star's X-ray luminosity, which will likely limit the precision with which X-ray measurements can yield age estimates. We also find weak evidence for mass dependence in the X-ray luminosity/age relationship. These results suggest that although X-ray luminosity correlates with stellar age, it may not serve as a reliable standalone age indicator and is better used as part of a broader suite of age-dating methods.",

The wide-FOV design significantly increases the complexity of the background environment, posing notable challenges for real-time gamma-ray burst (GRB) identification. In this work, we propose an in-orbit GRB identification method based on machine learning, using simulated spectral data as input. A training dataset was constructed using a Geant4-based simulator, incorporating in-orbit background and GRB events modeled within the 2-10 keV energy range. To meet the computational constraints of onboard processing, we employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM), which is fine-tuned using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based on miniCPM-V2.6 and quantized to 4-bit precision. The model achieves perfect classification accuracy on validation data and demonstrates strong regression performance in estimating GRB spectral indices, with an RMSE of 0.118.

Palumbo Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics. 20 pages, 21 figures Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Direct electromagnetic observation of the orbital motion of a sub-parsec, supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) would provide the first conclusive proof of such systems existing. Widely considered to be the sources of gravitational waves, binaries are expected to form as a natural consequence of galactic mergers and determining the processes that drive their evolution is essential for understanding cosmological evolution. In this work, we evaluate the prospects of using ground and spaceborne Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) to observe supermassive black hole binaries and estimate their orbital parameters. The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) is considered as the primary case study. Achieving unprecedented resolution, BHEX will provide access to a new volume of binary parameter space, potentially enabling the first, confident detection of an SMBHB. A binary toy model using a post-Newtonian orbit propagation is developed and simulated observations by BHEX and a ground array of telescopes are performed. An orbit fitting approach using Bayesian dynamic nested sampling is presented and its efficacy is demonstrated on the simulated observational data for a set of example binary systems. It is found that for BHEX, binary detection requires a total flux density of 0.04 Jy with a minimum separation of ~2 microarcseconds and an observable mass ratio dependent on the total flux. With three annual observations, BHEX could constrain semi-major axis and eccentricity of binaries with orbital periods <10 years to within 13% of the true values. A curved trajectory could confidently be detected in binaries with period <23 years. Proposals for how candidate sources could be identified in time for the BHEX mission are also provided. Finally, we constrain the requirements of a future spaceborne VLBI system, capable of performing a statistically significant survey of supermassive black hole binaries.",

      "abstract": "Late-Time Evolution of Magnetized Disks in Tidal Disruption Events Yael Alush, Nicholas C. Stone 14 pages, 14 figures, 1 tables. Comments are welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) In classic time-dependent 1D accretion disk models, the inner radiation pressure dominated regime is viscously unstable. However, late-time observations of accretion disks formed in tidal disruption events (TDEs) do not exhibit evidence of such instabilities. The common theoretical response is to modify the viscosity parametrization, but typically used viscosity parametrization are generally ad hoc. In this study, we take a different approach, and investigate a time-dependent 1D $\\alpha$-disk model in which the pressure is dominated by magnetic fields rather than photons. We compare the time evolution of thermally stable, strongly magnetized TDE disks to the simpler linear viscosity model. We find that the light curves of magnetized disks evolve as $L_{\\rm UV}\\propto t^{-5/6}$ for decades to centuries, and that this same evolution can be reproduced by the linear viscosity model for specific parameter choices. Additionally, we show that TDEs remain UV-bright for many years, suggesting we could possibly find fossil TDEs decades after their bursts. We estimate that ULTRASAT could detect hundreds of such events, providing an opportunity to study late-stage TDE physics and supermassive black hole (SMBH) properties. Finally, we explore the connection between TDE disks and quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) suggested by recent observations. One theoretical explanation involves TDE disks expanding to interact with extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), which produce X-ray flares as the EMRI passes through the disk. Our estimates indicate that magnetized TDE disks should exhibit QPEs earlier than those observed in AT2019qiz, suggesting that the QPEs may have begun before their first detection.",

The SN was discovered in the spiral galaxy NGC 3521 (distance $\\sim$11 Mpc) within a day after the explosion. The early spectra of SN 2024aecx show a weak signature of hydrogen lines, which disappeared in $\\sim$30 days after the explosion. Light curves in all bands show a distinct feature of two peaks, and the first peak is likely due to the shock cooling emission. The early phase light curve evolution of SN 2024aecx has similarity with the typical Type IIb events, but the decay rate in different bands (e.g., $\\rm \\Delta m_{15}$ = 1.60 $\\pm$ 0.05 mag, $g$-band) is significantly faster in the post-peak phase. It attained the secondary maximum in $\\sim$19 days ($g$-band) with a peak absolute magnitude of M$_{g}$ = -17.94 $\\pm$ 0.10 mag. SN 2024aecx colors trend redder in early epochs ($<$8 days), followed by a duration in which it grows bluer, then later gets redder again $>$20 days after explosion. The analytical model fitting to the light curves reveals an envelope mass and progenitor radii in the range of $\\sim$0.03 - 0.24 $M_\\odot$ and $\\sim$169 - 200 $R_\\odot$, respectively. Modeling of the pseudo-bolometric light curve suggests that synthesized $^{56}$Ni in the explosion was $\\sim$0.15 M$_{\\odot}$ with ejecta mass and kinetic energy of $\\sim$0.7 M$_{\\odot}$ and $\\sim$0.16 $\\times$ 10$^{51}$ erg, respectively. The observational properties and modeling indicate that the SN~2024aecx progenitor belongs to the extended progenitor category.",

      "abstract": "Attributing the point symmetric structure of core-collapse supernova remnant N132D to the jittering jets explosion mechanism Noam Soker (Technion, Israel) Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) I identified a point-symmetric morphology in the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant (CCSNR) N132D, composed of two symmetry axes: the short symmetry axis extending from the northwest ear and through the center of the iron-rich emission on the other side, and the second along the long dimension of N132D and coincides with the extension of the central oxygen-rich gas to the northeast. Namely, the point-symmetry of the outer zones of CCSNR N132D correlates with that of the oxygen-rich gas near the center. The surrounding gas cannot shape the inner oxygen-rich material, implying that the point-symmetric morphology is a property of the explosion mechanism, as predicted by the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). The oxygen-rich material is known to be in a torus. According to the JJEM, an energetic pair of opposite jets, more or less perpendicular to the plane of the torus, has shaped the torus; this pair is along the short symmetry axis. Another energetic pair, perpendicular to the first one, shaped the elongated, large-scale structure of CCSNR N132D. I discuss how the JJEM accounts for two perpendicular pairs of jets and the unequal jets in each pair. CCSNR N132D is the fifteenth CCSNR with an identified point-symmetric morphology attributed to the JJEM. Because the neutrino-driven mechanism cannot explain such morphologies, this study further strengthens the claim that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.",

Pang, Mattia Bulla, Henrik Rose, Hannah Wichern, Tim Dietrich 18 pages, 15 figures, matches the version published in A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows and kilonovae (KNe) are electromagnetic transients that can accompany binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. Therefore, studying their emission processes is of general interest for constraining cosmological parameters or the behavior of ultra-dense matter. One common method to analyze electromagnetic data from BNS mergers is to sample a Bayesian posterior over the parameters of a physical model for the transient. However, sampling the posterior is computationally costly and because of the many likelihood evaluations required in this process, detailed models are too expensive to be used directly in Bayesian inference. In this paper, we address the problem by introducing fiesta, a python package to train machine learning (ML) surrogates for GRB afterglow and kilonova models that have the capacity to accelerate likelihood evaluations. Specifically, we introduce extensive ML surrogates for the state-of-the-art GRB afterglow models afterglowpy and pyblastafterglow, along with a new surrogate for KN emission based on the possis code. Our surrogates enable evaluation of the light-curve posterior within minutes. We also provide built-in posterior sampling capabilities in fiesta that rely on the flowMC package, which efficiently scale to higher dimensions when adding up to tens of nuisance sampling parameters. Because of its use of the JAX framework, fiesta also allows for GPU acceleration during both surrogate training and posterior sampling. We applied our framework to reanalyze AT2017gfo/GRB170817A and GRB211211A with our surrogates, thus employing the new pyblastafterglow model for the first time in Bayesian inference.",

Such misaligned disk undergoes Lense-Thirring precession around the SMBH spin axis, leading to a precessing jet if launched in the vicinity of the SMBH and aligned with the disk angular momentum. The bound debris can also build a thick envelope which powers optical emission. In this work, we study the propagation of the precessing jet in the TDE envelope. We adopt a ''zero-Bernoulli accretion'' (ZEBRA) envelope model. A episodic jet will be observed if the line of sight is just at the envelope pole direction and $\\theta_{\\rm LT}=\\theta_{\\rm env}$, since the jet can freely escape from this low density rotation funnel, where $\\theta_{\\rm LT}$ and $\\theta_{\\rm env}$ are the jet precessing angle and the angle between the envelope polar axis and the SMBH spin axis, respectively. The jet will be choked at other directions. For $\\theta_{\\rm LT} < \\theta_{\\rm env}$, the jets can also break out of the envelope for very small precession angle $\\theta_{\\rm LT}$ or if the jet is aligned with SMBH spin. If the jet is choked within the envelope, the radiation produced during cocoon shock breakout will imprint characteristic signatures on the X-ray emission, such as low-amplitude fluctuation in the light curve.",

Rasio 12 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables. Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) GW231123, the most massive binary black hole (BBH) merger detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, highlights the need to understand the origins of massive, high-spin stellar black holes (BHs). Dense star clusters provide natural environments for forming such systems, beyond the limits of standard massive star evolution to core collapse. While repeated BBH mergers can grow BHs through dynamical interactions (the so-called \"hierarchical merger\" channel), most star clusters with masses $\\lesssim 10^6\\,M_\\odot$ have escape speeds too low to retain higher-generation BHs, limiting growth into or beyond the mass gap. In contrast, BH--star collisions with subsequent accretion of the collision debris can grow and retain BHs irrespective of the cluster escape speed. Using $N$-body (Cluster Monte Carlo) simulations, we study BH growth and spin evolution through this process and we find that accretion can drive BH masses up to at least $\\sim200\\,M_\\odot$, with spins set by the details of the growth history. BHs up to about $150\\,M_\\odot$ can reach dimensionless spins $\\chi \\gtrsim 0.7$ via single coherent episodes, while more massive BHs form through multiple stochastic accretion events and eventually spin down to $\\chi \\lesssim 0.4$. These BHs later form binaries through dynamical encounters, producing BBH mergers that contribute up to $\\sim10\\%$ of all detectable events, comparable to predictions for the hierarchical channel. However, the two pathways predict distinct signatures: hierarchical mergers yield more unequal mass ratios, whereas accretion-grown BHs preferentially form near-equal-mass binaries. The accretion-driven channel allows dense clusters with low escape speeds, such as globular clusters, to produce highly spinning BBHs with both components in or above the mass gap, providing a natural formation pathway to GW231123-like systems.",

Study of head-tail galaxies provides us with fruitful insights into the mechanisms of shock waves and turbulence, as well as magnetic-field amplification and cosmic-ray acceleration. A recent MeerKAT observation revealed that a head-tail galaxy in the galaxy cluster, Abell 3322, exhibits a peculiar ``Omega\" structure in its shape. In this paper, we investigated this Omega-tail galaxy using the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). We found that the southern jet tends to be brighter than the northern jet, with a brightness ratio of about 2. This can be attributed to Doppler boost and the inclination of the jets. Our broadband data suggest that the radio spectrum becomes steeper along the jet propagation direction, and the cosmic-ray aging model with a weak reacceleration of cosmic rays is preferable to explain the index profile. We further found a gradient of the spectral index perpendicular to the jet propagation. We discussed the origin of the gradient and suggested that a shock wave along one side of the jets is present. The resultant ram pressure as well as the backflow made at the early stage of the jet may produce the tail component of this Omega-tail galaxy, while the observed Omega-shape structure is more likely due to a twin vortex seen in the low Reynolds number flow.",

The resulting local energy transfer (a few keV per ~10 MeV neutrino) accumulates across the ~100 km stalled-shock layer, yielding a total heating of 10^49-10^50 erg, comparable within an order of magnitude to the increment required to trigger shock revival in current multidimensional simulations. This indicates that the long-standing failure of isoenergetic transport schemes to revive the shock originates from their neglect of recoil kinematics. Because the momentum exchange in each scattering is tiny, the emergent neutrino spectra and lepton-number balance remain essentially unchanged. The result highlights nuclear recoil as a minimal yet physically grounded correction to standard neutrino transport, providing a self-consistent route toward reliable explosion modeling.",

It was selected following a proposal call for science programs that would benefit from an early community-based definition (Sanderson et al 2024). The community was invited to submit white papers and science pitches with a deadline of May 20, 2024; the Roman Galactic Plane Survey Definition Committee (RGPS-DC) first met on Sep 11, 2024. Based on the input provided, the RGPS-DC recommends a survey consisting of three elements: (1) a wide-field science element (691 sq deg, 541 hrs) covering the Galactic plane, Galactic latitude |b|<2 deg and Galactic longitude l=+50.1 deg to -79 deg (281 deg), in four filters (F129, F159, F184, and F213) with higher latitude extensions for the bulge, the Serpens South/W40 star formation region, and Carina, (2) a time-domain science element (19 sq deg , 130 hrs) of six fields, including the full Nuclear Stellar Disk (NSD) and Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), with coverage in seven filters and repeat observations in one or more filters with cadences from 11 minutes to weeks, and (3) a deep-field/spectroscopic science element (4 sq deg , 30 hrs) consisting of fifteen Roman pointings (with a wide range of extinction, diffuse emission, stellar density and population) using longer exposure times in seven filters in addition to grism and prism observations. This document summarizes the science that can be done with this survey, the process of survey definition, and details on all of the program elements.",

We present GLIMPSE-17775, a luminous ($L_{\\rm bol}\\sim10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$) LRD at $z=3.501$ behind Abell S1063 ($\\mu\\sim2$), observed with deep JWST/NIRCam and a $\\sim$20 hr (80 hr de-lensed) NIRSpec/G395M spectrum. The data reveal 40+ emission and absorption features, including a rich forest of low-ionization FeII lines and numerous broad hydrogen recombination transitions. We use this depth to test the dense-gas interpretation through five independent diagnostics. Nearly all permitted lines show exponential wings with consistent FWHM, the signature of Thomson scattering requiring $n_e\\gtrsim10^8$ cm$^{-3}$. Adopting this width yields $M_{\\rm BH}\\sim10^{6.7}M_\\odot$, a factor of ten lower than Gaussian fits, and $\\lambda_{\\rm Edd}\\sim1.8$. Additional diagnostics support the same picture: a pronounced Balmer break ($f_{\\nu,4050}/f_{\\nu,3670}=2.0\\pm0.1$), enhanced HeI $\\lambda7065$ and $\\lambda10830$ with P-Cygni absorption, Bowen-fluorescent OI $\\lambda8446$-$\\lambda11290$ emission requiring Ly$\\beta$ pumping, and 16 FeII lines matching fluorescence models. These features indicate a dense ($n\\sim10^8$ cm$^{-3}$), partially ionized cocoon where scattering and fluorescence dominate line formation, providing strong evidence that at least some LRDs are powered by super-Eddington black-hole growth in the early Universe.",

Koekemoer, Sean Morrison, Castalia Alenka Negrete Peñaloza, Mara Salvato, Donald P. Schneider, Yue Shen, Marzena Śniegowska Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs) exhibit dramatic spectral variability on unexpectedly short timescales, challenging standard accretion flow models. Despite growing samples, the physical drivers of this extreme variability, and the potential link to host-galaxy properties, remain unknown. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, the transition between AGN-dominated and host-dominated spectra offers a unique opportunity to study relations between AGNs and their hosts within the same objects. We present intermediate-resolution spectroscopy of 23 CL-AGNs identified by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V), obtained with VLT/X-shooter and Gemini-N/GMOS. An analysis of the Mgii emission line observed in the spectra demonstrates that the majority of these sources cannot be driven by variable obscuration. Our CL-AGNs roughly follow the M_BH-sigma_* and M_BH-M_* relations of inactive galaxies, with a median black hole-to-stellar mass ratio of 0.38%, although they show hints of a shallower slope. We find no evidence that the stellar population properties of our CL-AGNs, including stellar mass, age, young stellar fraction, and star-formation rate differ from those of Type 2 AGNs in SDSS. These results suggest that CL-AGNs reside in typical AGN host galaxies and that their extreme variability is likely unrelated to host-galaxy environment, supporting the idea that CL-AGNs are not a distinct population, but rather represent a phase of normal AGN activity. This result, in turn, implies that CL-AGNs can serve as useful probes of the AGN-host connection, providing access to both AGN-dominated and host-dominated spectra of the same systems.",

The official image release of the survey is available at this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present an overview of the JWST GLIMPSE program, highlighting its survey design, primary science goals, gravitational lensing models, and first results. GLIMPSE provides ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam imaging across seven broadband filters (F090W, F115W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F444W) and two medium-band filters (F410M, F480M), with exposure times ranging from 20 to 40 hours per filter. This yields a 5$\\sigma$ limiting magnitude of 30.9 AB (measured in a 0.2 arcsec diameter aperture). The field is supported by extensive ancillary data, including deep HST imaging from the Hubble Frontier Fields program, VLT/MUSE spectroscopy, and deep JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution multi-object spectroscopy. Exploiting the strong gravitational lensing of the galaxy cluster Abell S1063, GLIMPSE probes intrinsic depths beyond 33 AB magnitudes and covers an effective source-plane area of approximately 4.4 arcmin$^2$ at $z \\sim 6$. The program's central aim is to constrain the abundance of the faintest galaxies from $z \\sim 6$ up to the highest redshifts, providing crucial benchmarks for galaxy formation models, which have so far been tested primarily on relatively bright systems. We present an initial sample of $\\sim 540$ galaxy candidates identified at $6 < z < 16$, with intrinsic UV magnitudes spanning $M_{\\mathrm UV}$ = $-$20 to $-$12. This enables unprecedented constraints on the extreme faint end of the UV luminosity function at these epochs. In addition, GLIMPSE opens new windows for spatially resolved studies of star clusters in early galaxies and the detection and characterization of faint high-$z$ active galactic nuclei. This paper accompanies the first public data release, which includes reduced JWST and HST mosaics, photometric catalogs, and gravitational lensing models.",

We use the ionizing photon density functions predicted by the model along with different models for the escape fraction of ionizing photons, $f_{\\rm esc}$, to study the effects of ionizing photons from faint galaxies and different assumptions about $f_{\\rm esc}$ on the evolution of hydrogen ionized fraction with redshift, $Q_{\\rm HII}(z)$. We show that accounting for the contribution of faint galaxies with UV luminosities $M_{1500}>-13$, and with a constant ionizing photon escape fraction of $f_{\\rm esc}=0.1$ results in the hydrogen reionization history consistent with all current observational constraints. Comparing results of the $f_{\\rm esc}=0.1$ model and two alternative models shows that the model with a strong luminosity dependence of $f_{\\rm esc}$, which assigns high $f_{\\rm esc}$ to faint galaxies, results in early reionization inconsistent with observational constraints. However, the model in which $f_{\\rm esc}$ follows a universal redshift-independent correlation with the recent maximum specific star formation rate, motivated by the results of the SPHINX galaxy formation simulation, results in the reionization history in good agreement with existing observational constraints, even though this model produces a sizeable ionized hydrogen fraction of $Q_{\\rm HII}\\approx 0.15-0.2$ at redshifts $z=8-12$. Our results show that the relative contribution of faint dwarf galaxies to reionization depends sensitively on assumptions about the escape fraction for galaxies of different luminosities, and that this is the main source of uncertainty in modeling hydrogen reionization.",

This galaxy has a massive H$_2$ reservoir and a radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN) and is undergoing a starburst event. We present new JWST observations of this system, revealing warm H$_2$ gas that is co-spatial with the cold molecular gas traced by CO, extending over 30 kpc around the BCG in a tail-like structure reaching into the circumgalactic medium of this galaxy. Analysis of the mid-infrared pure H$_2$ rotational lines H$_2$S(1), H$_2$S(5), and H$_2$S(9) indicate warm gas temperatures of $515.6 \\pm 0.8$ K and $535.2\\pm 1.9$ K in the BCG and tail regions, respectively. We compare cold gas, traced by the CO(3-2) observed with ALMA, to the warm gas traced by JWST. The warm-to-cold molecular gas fraction is comparable in the BCG ($1.4\\%\\pm0.2\\%$) and the CGM tail ($1.9\\%\\pm0.3\\%$). Our analysis suggests that the dissipation of the kinetic energy of the H$_2$-emitting gas is sufficient to lead to the formation of the CO gas. This observation provides new insights into the molecular gas distribution and its potential role in the interplay between the central galaxy and its circumgalactic environment.",

Ren 8 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in A&A, comments are welcomed Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The single-epoch virial method is a fundamental tool for estimating supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses in large samples of AGNs and has been extensively employed in studies of SMBH-galaxy co-evolution across cosmic time. However, since this method is calibrated using reverberation-mapped AGNs, its validity across the entire AGN population remains uncertain. We aim to examine the breathing effect-the variability of emission line widths with continuum luminosity-beyond reverberation-mapped AGNs, to assess the validity and estimate potential systematic uncertainties of single-epoch virial black hole mass estimates. We construct an unprecedentedly large multi-epoch spectroscopic dataset of quasars from SDSS DR16, focusing on four key broad emission lines (Ha, Hb, MgII, and CIV). We assess how breathing behavior evolves with the rest-frame time interval between observations. We detect no significant breathing signal in Ha, Hb, or MgII at any observed timescale. In contrast, CIV exhibits a statistically significant anti-breathing trend, most prominent at intermediate timescales. Notably, for Hb, which has shown breathing in previous reverberation-mapped samples, we recover the effect only in the small subset of quasars with clearly detected BLR lags and only during the epochs when such lags are measurable-suggesting that both the lag and breathing signals are intermittent, possibly due to a weak correlation between optical and ionizing continua. These results highlight the complex, variable, and timescale-dependent nature of line profile variability and underscore its implications for single-epoch black hole mass estimates.",

Comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Milky Way harbours a prominent m=1 lopsided distortion in both stellar and neutral gas distributions. On the other hand, chemo-dynamical studies have been proven to be effective in grasping the overall evolution of galaxies. Here, we investigate systematically the excitation and evolution of a merger-driven $m=1$ lopsidedness in a Milky Way (MW)-like host galaxy, as a function of chemical distribution of stars. Using seven dissipationless, high-resolution $N$-body simulations of minor mergers (between a MW-like host and a satellite) under varying orbital configurations (prograde/retrograde and different orientation of the satellite orbital plane), we first show that a tidal interaction excites a prominent $m=1$ lopsidedness in the stellar density and velocity distribution of the MW-like host. Assigning, a posteriori, metallicities to stellar particles of the MW-like host based on the current observational constraints, we sub-divide the stars into metal-rich ([Fe/H] > 0), metal-intermediate (-0.5 < [Fe/H] <0), and metal-poor (- 0.5 < [Fe/H]) populations. We demonstrate that metal-rich population always show a much stronger $m=1$ lopsidedness in both density and velocity distributions when compared to other two populations. This trend holds true for all minor merger model considered here, regardless of their orbital configurations. Furthermore, minor merger also triggers a transient off-centred stellar disc-dark matter halo configuration, with metal-rich population showing the highest degree of disc-halo offset. We show that the metal-rich population which is kinematically colder (i.e. lower velocity dispersion) by construction, is more susceptible to external perturbations. Lastly, using a catalogue of photometry and metalicity for the LMC, we show that the strength of the $m=1$ distortion (predominantly in the form of an one-arm spiral) in stars increases with metallicity as well.",

Revision submitted on November 6th, 2025 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Accurately modeling molecular hydrogen ($\\text{H}_{2}$) is an important task in cosmological simulations because it regulates star formation. One fundamental property of $\\text{H}_{2}$ is the ability to self-shield, a phenomenon in which the $\\text{H}_{2}$ in the outer layer of a molecular cloud absorbs the photodissociating Lyman-Werner UV radiation and shields the inner $\\text{H}_{2}$. Historically, numerical approximations have been utilized to avoid intensive ray-tracing calculations. This paper evaluates the use of the Sobolev-like density-gradient approximation in $\\text{H}_{2}$ self-shielding modeling and tests its agreement with a more rigorous adaptive ray-tracing method in cosmological simulations. We ran four high-resolution zoom-in cosmological simulations to investigate the models' effects in the early Reionization Era ($z \\geq 12$). We find that the approximation model returns a higher $\\text{H}_{2}$ photodissociation rate in low gas density environments but lower the rate when gas density is high, resulting in low-mass halos having less $\\text{H}_{2}$ while high-mass halos having more $\\text{H}_{2}$. The approximation also hinders star formation in small halos, but it less affects the stellar mass of larger halos. Inside a halo, the discrepancies between the two models regarding $\\text{H}_{2}$ fraction, temperature, and stellar mass are radially dependent. On a large scale, the simulations using the approximation have less $\\text{H}_{2}$ in the intergalactic medium and may experience a slower reionization process. These results show that the Sobolev-like approximation alters properties of galaxies and the large-scale universe when compared to the ray-tracing treatment, emphasizing a need for caution when interpreting results from these two techniques in cosmological simulations.",

We propose that LRDs form naturally after feedback-free starbursts (FFB) in thousands of star clusters and following wet compaction. Analytically, we show how the clusters enable efficient dry migration of stars and BHs to the galaxy center by two-body segregation and dynamical friction against the disk. The clusters merge to form compact central clusters as observed. Mutual tidal stripping does not qualitatively affect the analysis. The young, rotating clusters are natural sites for the formation of BH seeds via rapid core collapse. The migrating clusters carry the BH seeds, which merge into central super-massive BHs (SMBHs). Compactions are required to deepen the potential wells such that the SMBHs are retained after post-merger gravitational-wave recoils, locked to the galaxy centers. Using cosmological simulations at different epochs, with different codes and physical recipes, we evaluate the additional growth of LRD-matching compact central stellar systems by global compaction events. Adding to the dry growth by cluster mergers, the compactions can increase the escape velocities to retain the SMBHs. The LRDs appear at $z \\!\\sim\\! 8$, after the formation of FFB clusters, and disappear after $z \\!\\sim\\! 4$ when the stellar mass is above $10^9 M_\\odot$ by growing post-compaction blue disks around the nuclear LRDs. The LRD abundance is expected to be $\\sim\\! 10^{-5} \\!-\\! 10^{-4}\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-3}$, increasing from $z \\!\\sim\\! 4$ to $z\\!\\sim\\! 8$.",

Angulo Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Wide-field, multi-filter photometric surveys enable the reconstruction of the Milky Way's star formation history (SFH) on Galactic scales and offer new insights into disc assembly. The twelve-filter system of the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) is particularly suitable, as its colours trace stellar chemical abundances and help alleviate the age-metallicity degeneracy in colour-magnitude diagram fitting. We aim to recover the SFH of the Galactic disc and separate its chemically distinct components by combining J-PLUS DR3 photometry with Gaia astrometry. We also evaluate the potential of isochrone fitting to estimate stellar ages and metallicities as proxies for evolutionary trends. We fit magnitudes and parallaxes of $1.38\\times10^{6}$ stars using a Bayesian multiple isochrone method. The bright region of the colour-absolute-magnitude diagram ($M_{r}\\leq4.2$ mag) constrains ages, while the faint region provides an empirical metallicity prior mitigating the age-metallicity degeneracy. Both PARSEC and BaSTI isochrones, in solar-scaled and $\\alpha$-enhanced forms, are adopted. The recovered SFH reveals two sequences: an $\\alpha$-enhanced population forming rapidly between $12.5$ and $8$ Gyr ago, enriching from [M/H]$\\sim-0.6$ to $0.1$ dex; and a solar-scaled sequence emerging $\\sim8$ Gyr ago, dominating after $\\sim7$ Gyr with slower enrichment reaching solar metallicity by $3$ Gyr. Metal-rich ([M/H]$\\gtrsim0$) stars are confined to $\\vert z_{GC}\\vert\\lesssim1$ kpc, whereas metal-poor ([M/H]$\\lesssim-0.5$) stars reach $\\vert z_{GC}\\vert\\sim2$ kpc. Simultaneous fitting of both isochrone families reveals distinct formation epochs for the thin and thick discs. J-PLUS multi-filter photometry, combined with Gaia parallaxes, mitigates age-metallicity degeneracies and enables detailed mapping of the Milky Way's temporal and chemical evolution.",

Ho, Ruancun Li Accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) To investigate the physical origin of the Balmer decrement in the broad-line region of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we measure the temporal variability of the fluxes of the broad H$\\beta$ and H$\\alpha$ emission lines using multi-epoch spectroscopic data of low-redshift AGNs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The analysis of the mean spectra reveals that the Balmer decrement shows no correlation with AGN luminosity, while it is inversely correlated with the Eddington ratio. However, the temporal variation of the Balmer decrement in individual objects exhibits an even stronger anti-correlation with AGN luminosity, suggesting that the change in AGN luminosity plays a dominant role in determining the Balmer decrement. By comparing the temporal evolution of the Balmer decrement with the continuum color, we find that reddening due to the AGN itself may not be the primary factor. Instead, radiative transfer effects and excitation mechanisms, which deviate from the Case B recombination, appear to be critical for the variation of the Balmer decrement. These results provide useful insights into the underlying physics of changing-look AGNs and high-$z$ AGNs, such as the ``little red dots'', which exhibit extreme values of the Balmer decrement that can be misinterpreted as evidence for dust.",

Brotherton, Jin-Ming Bai, Wei-Jian Guo, Seng Yang, Zhu-Heng Yao, Jesus Aceituno Revised. Comments greatly appreciated and warmly welcomed! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Delayed reverberations of broad emission lines in response to optical continuum variations have been widely observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). They serve as a powerful tool for probing inner structures of AGNs and estimating the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The delays exhibit a strong correlation with approximately the square root of the optical luminosity - a relationship known as the \"standard structure\" of AGN broad-line regions (BLRs). Here, we report the discovery of leading delays in H{\\beta} line reverberations (LDRs) in the quasar PHL 1092 preceding variations of the 5100 Å continuum by 17-57 days, based on our eight-year continuous campaign of reverberation mapping of super Eddington AGNs. The LDRs suggest that the 5100 Å continuum regions are so extensive that they are larger than the BLRs. This phenomenon not only fundamentally disrupts the well-established BLR size-luminosity relation but also violates the principle of causality. This unprecedented LDRs challenge the conventional methods for estimating SMBH mass as well as the standard model of AGNs. A preferred scenario to explain the LDRs is that the SMBH-disk contains a population of accreting stellar-mass black holes (sMBHs) as extra heating sources of the disk. Consequently, continuum regions of the disk are efficiently stretched so that the 5100 Å regions exceed the BLRs, yielding the observed LDRs. Generally, sMBH activities there could provide new physics of AGN phenomena, which can be tested by LIGO, LISA/Tianqin and ET detections of gravitational waves from sMBH mergers.",

By adding a rotating disk component to the biconical outflow model of Bae & Woo, we find that models with a rotating disk require faster launching velocities ($\\lesssim$ 1500 km s$^{-1}$) than outflow-only models to be consistent with the observed gas kinematics of local type 2 AGNs. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to reproduce the observed distribution of gas kinematics of a large sample ($\\sim$ 39,000), constraining the launching velocity and opening angle. While the launching velocity is moderate for the majority of the local AGNs, the notable cases of 2 - 5 % show strong outflows with $V_{max} \\sim 1000-1500$ km s$^{-1}$. By examining the seeing effect based on the mock integral field unit data, we find that the outflow sizes measured based on velocity widths tend to be overestimated when the angular size of the outflow is comparable to or smaller than the seeing. This result highlights the need for more careful treatments of the seeing effect in the outflow size measurement, yet it still supports the lack of global feedback by gas outflows for local AGNs.",

Chibueze New Astronomy Volume 123, February 2026, 102482 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We investigated the distributions of classified young stellar object (YSO) in nine star-forming regions associated with Hii regions, namely Sh2-22, Sh2-19, Sh2-17, M16, M8, IC5070, Sh2-252, NGC2467 and M42, as a means of exploring the star formation scenarios (triggered or spontaneous) in the various regions. The YSO distributions of nine regions along the galactic longitudes and across different spiral arms were explored. It is noted that Sh2-22 and Sh2-19 may have evidence of localized triggered star formation, whereas Sh2-17 may be a spontaneous star forming region. The results showed that the location within the Milky Way may influence localized triggered star formation within individual regions. There is strong evidence that there are fewer older stars (Transition Disks) within the Outer regions of the Galaxy (2.91 +- 1.74%), accompanied by a higher number of Class I (32.49 +- 10.77%). This is different from the Inner Galactic regions where the Transition Disks are higher (32.93 +- 13.78%) as compared to low Class I sources (11.01 +- 4.81%). The number of Class II stars is relatively high and increases from the Inner regions (52.64 +- 10.07%) to Outer regions (64.54 +- 11.09%).

Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) $\\textit{Context.}$ There is considerable debate on how massive stars form, including whether a high-mass star must always form with a population of low-mass stars or whether it can also form in isolation. Massive stars found in the field are often considered to be runaways from star clusters or OB associations. However, there is evidence in the Milky Way and the Small Magellanic Cloud of high-mass stars that appear isolated in the field and cannot be related to any known star cluster or OB association. Studies of more distant galaxies have been lacking so far. $\\textit{Aims.}$ In this work, we identified massive star candidates that appear isolated in the field of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 4242 (distance: 5.3 Mpc), to explore how many candidates for isolated star formation we find in a galaxy outside the Local Group. $\\textit{Methods.}$ We identified 234 massive ($M_{ini}\\geq15M_{\\odot}$) and young ($\\leq 10$ Myr) field stars in NGC 4242 using the Hubble Space Telescope's Solar Blind Channel of the Advanced Camera for Surveys, the UVIS channel of the Wide Field Camera 3 from the Galaxy UV Legacy Project (GULP) and optical data from the Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS). We investigated the surroundings of our targets within the range of projected distances expected for runaway stars, $74$ pc and $204$ pc. $\\textit{Results.}$ We find that between $9.8\\%$ and $34.6\\%$ of our targets have no young stellar groups or massive stars within the threshold radii, making them appear isolated. This fraction reduces to $3.2\\%-11.5\\%$ when we consider the total number of massive stars expected from the observed UV star formation rate. $\\textit{Conclusions.}$ Our results show that there is a small population of young and massive, potentially isolated field stars in NGC 4242.",

Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Most star clusters dissolve into the Galaxy over tens to hundreds of millions of years after they form. While recent Gaia studies have honed our view of cluster dispersal, the exact chronology of which star formation events begat which star cluster remnants remains unclear. This problem is acute after 100 Myr, when cluster remnants have spread over hundreds of parsecs and most age estimates for main sequence stars are too imprecise to link the stars to their birth events. Here we develop a Bayesian framework that combines TESS stellar rotation rates with Gaia kinematics to identify diffuse remnants of open clusters. We apply our method to the Pleiades, which previous studies have noted shows kinematic similarities to other nearby young stellar groups. We find that the Pleiades constitutes the bound core of a much larger, coeval structure that contains multiple known clusters distributed over 600 pc. We refer to this structure as the Greater Pleiades Complex. On the basis of uniform ages, coherent space velocities, detailed elemental abundances, and traceback histories, we conclude that most stars in this complex originated from the same giant molecular cloud. This work establishes a scalable approach for tracing the genealogies of nearby clusters and further cements the Pleiades as a cornerstone of stellar astrophysics. We aim to apply this methodology to other associations as part of the upcoming TESS All-Sky Rotation Survey.",

We propose a novel integration scheme, designed to be compatible with Strang splitting techniques, which allows for the straightforward integration of external forces and hydrodynamic fluxes in general-purpose hydrodynamic simulation codes. Moreover, this solver leverages an analytical solution to the problem of drag acceleration, ensuring linear complexity even in cases with multiple dust grain sizes, as opposed to the cubic scaling of methods that require a matrix inversion step. This new General Implicit Runge-Kutta integrator (GIRK) is evaluated using standard benchmarks for dust dynamics such as DUSTYBOX, DUSTYWAVE, and DUSTYSHOCK. The results demonstrate not only the accuracy of the method but also the expected scalings in terms of accuracy, convergence to equilibrium, and execution time. GIRK can be easily implemented in hydrodynamical simulations alongside hydrodynamical steps and external forces, and is especially useful in simulations with a large number of dust grain sizes.",

We describe the design and early implementation of a survey to test whether planets also exist orbiting the remnant stars of ancient dwarf galaxies that merged with the Milky Way, and if so, how they differ from their Milky Way counterparts. VOYAGERS (Views Of Yore - Ancient Gaia-enceladus Exoplanet Revealing Survey) is a radial velocity (RV) search using precision spectrographs to discover exoplanets orbiting very low metallicity ($-2.8 < [\\mathrm{Fe/H}] \\leq -0.8$) stars born in the dwarf galaxy Enceladus, which merged with the Milky Way galaxy about 10 Gyr ago. A sample of 22 candidates have been screened from a catalog of Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES) members using a combination of stellar properties and reconnaissance observations from the TRES spectrograph. Precision RV measurements have been initiated using the NEID, HARPS-N, and CARMENES spectrographs. We plan to focus most upcoming observations on 10 main sequence targets. Data collection is well underway, with 778 observations on 22 candidates (385 of which are 10 focus targets), but far from complete. This survey is designed to be sensitive to sub-Neptune mass planets with periods up to hundreds of days. We note that the RV analysis gives mass multiplied by $\\sin (inclination)$ or the minimum mass for exoplanets. The expected survey yield is three planets, assuming that occurrence rates are similar to those in the Milky Way and taking into account the degeneracy with inclination in our yield models. Our survey is designed to detect at least one exoplanet if occurrence rates are similar to known Milky Way exoplanets or, if no exoplanets are discovered, to rule out a Milky Way-like planet population in GES with 95% confidence level.",

However, numerically solving the underlying radiative transfer equation is computationally intensive due to the complex interaction of light with matter and the disparity between the speed of light and the typical gas velocities in astrophysical environments, making it particularly expensive to include the effects of on-the-fly radiation in hydrodynamic simulations. This motivates the development of surrogate models that can significantly accelerate radiative transfer calculations while preserving high accuracy. We present a surrogate model based on a Fourier Neural Operator architecture combined with U-Nets. Our model approximates three-dimensional, monochromatic radiative transfer in time-dependent regimes, in absorption-emission approximation, achieving speedups of more than 2 orders of magnitude while maintaining an average relative error below 3%, demonstrating our approach's potential to be integrated into state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations.",

Comments are welcome Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Supermassive stars (SMSs) may explain both the early emergence of supermassive black holes and the unusual abundance patterns observed in young galaxies and globular clusters. They are traditionally associated with primordial ``direct collapse'' at very low metallicity, but recent studies indicate that SMSs can also form in metal-enriched environments alongside numerous low-mass stars. We present detailed evolutionary models of SMSs with metallicities \\(Z/Z_\\odot = 10^{-5}\\)--\\(10^{-2}\\), computed using \\textsc{GENEC} and consistent with protostellar growth rates derived from cluster-collapse simulations. The final masses reach \\(\\sim7.2\\times10^{4}\\,M_\\odot\\) at \\(10^{-5}\\,Z_\\odot\\) and \\(\\sim2.3\\times10^{3}\\,M_\\odot\\) at \\(10^{-2}\\,Z_\\odot\\) through gas accretion and stellar collisions. Each model is evolved through the pre-main-sequence and core-hydrogen-burning phases, terminating either at the onset of general-relativistic instability \\(Z\\lesssim10^{-4}\\,Z\\) or at core-helium exhaustion for \\(Z\\gtrsim10^{-3}\\,Z\\). The dominant growth mode transitions from collision-dominated to accretion-limited between \\(Z = 10^{-4}\\) and \\(10^{-3}\\), while stellar lifetimes remain nearly constant at \\(1.8\\)--\\(2.0\\) Myr. We find that even in extreme cases, when additional hydrogen supplied by collisions amounts to \\(\\sim4.7\\times10^{4}\\,M_\\odot\\), the lifetime is only extended by \\(\\sim0.6\\) Myr. During core-hydrogen burning, the critical accretion rate required to maintain the supergiant phase along the Hayashi line (\\(\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{crit}}\\)) decreases as nuclear fuel is consumed, reducing UV emissivity and feedback efficiency. This facilitates SMS formation in a broader range of environments than previously expected, including those with metallicities up to \\(Z \\simeq 0.01\\,Z_\\odot\\), typical of globular clusters.",

This study investigates the effect of the presence of bars on the environmental dependence of disc galaxies' properties using the volume-limited sample from Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey. The disc galaxies with and without bars samples were obtained using the Galaxy Zoo 2 project then assigned into isolated and non-isolated sub-samples. These sub-samples were used to compare the stellar mass, star formation rate, $g-r$ colour, concentration index and gas phase metallicity, and their relationships between isolated and non-isolated environments. Then these are used to investigate if there is an existence of any difference between galaxies with and without bars. A one-to-one correspondence between isolated and non-isolated galaxy properties was observed, and a strong dependence on the environment for properties of unbarred galaxies was observed when compared to barred. The stellar mass against star formation rate, $g-r$ colour against concentration index and stellar mass against gas phase metallicity of unbarred galaxies strongly depend on environment while for barred these relations weakly depend on environment. The study concludes that bars in disc galaxies decrease the dependence of analysed properties and their relations on the environment.",

The used KETJU code combines the GADGET-4 fast multiple gravity solver with accurate regularised integration and post-Newtonian corrections (up to PN3.5) around SMBHs.

For recoil velocities up to $60\\%$ of the galaxy escape velocity, the BRCs are detectable in mock photometric images at a Euclid-like resolution up to redshift $z \\sim 1.0$. By Monte Carlo sampling the observability for different recoil directions and magnitudes, we predict that in $\\sim20\\%$ of instances the BRCs are photometrically detectable, most likely for kicks with SMBH apocentres less than the galaxy effective radius. BRCs occupy distinct regions in the stellar mass/velocity dispersion vs. size relations of known star clusters and galaxies. An enhanced velocity dispersion in excess of $\\sigma \\sim 600\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s}^{-1}$ coinciding with the SMBH position provides the best evidence for an SMBH-hosting stellar system, effectively distinguishing BRCs from other faint stellar systems. BRCs are promising candidates to observe the aftermath of the yet-undetected mergers of the most massive SMBHs and we estimate that up to 8000 BRCs might be observable below $z\\lesssim 0.6$ with large-scale photometric surveys such as Euclid and upcoming high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy with the Extremely Large Telescope.",

The stellar velocity field is well described by a rotating disk model, with its kinematical center offset by ~ 0.5 arcsec from the continuum peak. The hot molecular gas is traced by the H$_2$2.12$\\mu$m emission line, and the ionized gas by [Fe II]1.64$\\mu$m and Pa$\\alpha$. The gas presents three main kinematic components: a rotating disk seen as a narrow component ($\\sigma$ ~ 100 kms$^{-1}$); a blueshifted broad outflow ($\\sigma$ ~ 250 kms$^{-1}$); and a fast ionized outflow as a very broad component ($\\sigma$ ~ 640 kms$^{-1}$). Extinction maps reveal high A$_V$ values, up to ~ 35, spatially coincident with dust lanes seen in optical images. In addition to the disk and outflows components, inflows along the dust lanes are detected in H$_2$ gas, with a mass inflow rate of $\\dot{M}_{in}$ ~ 4 x 10$^{-4}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, which is lower than the AGN accretion rate. For the outflows, we derive peak mass-outflow rates of 0.08 $\\pm$ 0.02 M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ (molecular) and 6.5 $\\pm$ 1.7 M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ (ionized). The outflow, driven by the radio jet, has a kinetic power of 5.7% of the jet power - enough to suppress star formation.

Abstract abridged as required by arXiv submission rules Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We model the wavelength dependence of structural parameters for a mass-limited sample ($M_\\star>10^{10}M_\\odot$) of $\\sim27,000$ quiescent galaxies with $0.2 < z < 0.6$ using $grizy$ photometry from Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam and dense spectroscopy from the HectoMAP survey. Based on Sérsic profile fits in all five bands, we estimate the circularized half-light radius $R_{e,c}$ and Sérsic index $n$ in two rest-frames: UV (3500 Å) and red (7000 Å). Combined with $M_\\star$, $z$, and D$_n4000$, $R_{e,c}$ and $n$ enable exploration of the evolution in the structural properties - stellar mass correlations for quiescent galaxies with different stellar population ages. At intermediate redshift, quiescent galaxies at all stellar masses show a systematic decline in $R_{e,c}$ and rise in $n$ with rest-frame wavelength. These structural variations are stronger for galaxies that recently joined the quiescent population (newcomers) than for the descendants of galaxies that are already quiescent at the survey limit, $z \\sim 0.6$ (aging population). The combined evidence supports inside-out quenching as the dominant mechanism halting star formation during this epoch. The typical size of a $M_\\star\\sim10^{11}M_\\odot$ quiescent galaxy increases by $\\sim30\\%$ between $z \\sim 0.6$ and $z \\sim 0.2$ in the red and remains constant in the UV; newcomers are $\\sim20\\%$ larger than the aging population. In the UV, quiescent galaxies maintain a constant $n\\sim4$ for the aging population and $n\\sim2$ for newcomers; in the red, both subpopulations have de Vaucouleurs profiles. Our findings link newcomers to their direct progenitors in the star-forming population. For the aging population, we suggest minor mergers with progressively redder satellites at lower redshifts as the primary driver of quiescent galaxy evolution. Forthcoming sensitive large-area imaging surveys will allow testing this prediction.",

      "abstract": "GravSphere2: A higher-order Jeans method for mass-modeling spherical stellar systems Andrés Bañares-Hernández, Justin I. Read, Mariana P. Júlio Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Mass-modeling methods are used to infer the gravitational field of stellar systems, from globular clusters to giant elliptical galaxies. While many methods exist, most require assumptions about the form of the underlying distribution function or data binning that leads to loss of information. With only line-of-sight (LOS) data, many methods suffer from the well-known mass-anisotropy degeneracy. To overcome these limitations, we develop a new, publicly available mass-modeling method, GravSphere2. This combines individual stellar velocities from LOS and proper motion (PM) measurements to solve the Jeans equations up to fourth order, without any data binning. Using flexible functional forms for the anisotropy profiles at second and fourth order, we show how including additional constraints from a new observable - fourth-order PMs - fully closes the system of equations, breaking the mass-anisotropy degeneracy at all orders. We test our method on mock data for dwarf galaxies, showing how GravSphere2 improves on previous methods. GravSphere2 recovers the mass density, stellar velocity anisotropy, and logarithmic slope of the mass density profile within its quoted 95% confidence intervals across almost all mocks over a wide radial range (0.1 < R/Rhalf < 10). We find GravSphere2 outperforms simple mass estimators, suggesting that it is worth using even when only a few LOS velocities are available. With 1,000 tracers without PMs, GravSphere2 recovers the logarithmic density slope at Rhalf with 12% (25%) statistical errors for cuspy (cored) mock data, enabling a distinction between the two. Including PMs, this improves to 8% (12%). With just 100 tracers and no PMs, we recover slopes with ~ 30% (20%) errors. GravSphere2 will be a valuable new tool to hunt for black holes and dark matter in spherical stellar systems, from globular clusters and dwarf galaxies to giant ellipticals and galaxy clusters.",

Jacoby, Rhea-Silvia Remus, Marcelo M. Miller Bertolami, Roberto H. Méndez 11 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in Frontiers Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) For decades, the theoretical understanding of planetary nebulae (PNe) has remained in tension with the observed universal bright-end cutoff of the PN luminosity function (PNLF). The brightest younger PN populations have been observed to be fainter in their [O III] emission than expected. Recent studies have proposed that circumnebular extinction is a key ingredient in bringing their brightness down to the observed level. In this work we use the recently introduced PICS (PNe In Cosmological Simulations) framework to investigate the impact of different circumnebular extinction treatments on the modeled PNe and their PNLF for a large range of stellar ages and metallicities. We test how different slopes in the observed relation of extinction versus central star mass modify the bright-end cutoffs of the PNLF, finding that steeper slopes lead to large changes for young stellar populations. In contrast, the differences for older PNe are much smaller. However, for individual PNe, the extinctions observed in nearby galaxies appear to be much higher than the models predict, showing that improvements on both the modeling and observational sides are needed to gain a better understanding of the brightest and strongly extincted PNe. These findings further advance the theoretical foundation for interpreting observed extragalactic PN populations coming from more complex composite stellar populations in the future.",

We estimated the observational uncertainties on the quasar's position using astrometric data from the Global Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics (GAIA) of field stars within the NIRCam images. We find that all six quasars are found within the central $\\sim 400$ pc of their host galaxy dust continuum and [CII] emission. Apparent offsets seen in rest-frame optical JWST observations are not detected in our ALMA data, suggesting they likely result from dust obscuration rather than a true physical separation between the SMBH and its host galaxy. Kinematic modeling of these data further reveals that none of the galaxies show evidence for recent merger activity, and most of the galaxies can be accurately modeled using a simple disk model. The lack of an offset supports theoretical models that predict that positional offset within these galaxies are either short-lived or intrinsically rare.",

Galli, Jean-Charles Cuillandre 16 pages, 5 tables, 20 figures, accepted for publication in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPs) have been detected through direct imaging in several young, nearby star-forming regions. The properties of circumstellar disks around these objects may provide a valuable probe into their origin but are currently limited by the small sample sizes explored. We aim to perform a statistical study of the occurrence of circumstellar disks down to the planetary-mass regime. We performed a systematic survey of disks among the population identified in the 5-10 Myr-old Upper Scorpius association (USC), restricted to members outside the younger, embedded Ophiuchus region and with estimated masses below 105 M_Jup. We took advantage of unWISE photometry to search for mid-infrared excesses in the WISE (W1-W2) color. We implemented a Bayesian outlier detection method, which models the photospheric sequence and computes excess probabilities for each object, enabling a statistically sound estimation of disk fractions. We explored disk fractions across an unprecedentedly fine mass grid, reaching down to objects as low as ~6 M_Jup assuming 5 Myr or ~8 M_Jup assuming 10 Myr, thus extending the previous lower boundary of disk fraction studies. Depending on the age, our sample includes between 17 and 40 FFPs. We confirm that the disk fraction steadily rises with decreasing mass and exceeds 30% near the substellar-to-planetary mass boundary at ~13 M_Jup. We find hints of a possible flattening in this trend around 25-45 M_Jup, potentially signaling a transition in the dominant formation processes. This shift in trend should be considered with caution and needs to be confirmed with more sensitive observations. Our results are consistent with the gradual dispersal of disks over time, as disk fractions in Upper Scorpius appear systematically lower than those in younger regions.",

However, the models used in those studies constrained the tachocline to be either prolate or oblate. We use helioseismic data obtained from long time series (2304 and 4608 days) to determine the shape of the solar tachocline. Like previous work, we use forward modeling methods for this work; however, we allow more flexibility for the shape of the tachocline. We find that the tachocline does indeed deviate from a simple prolate structure and bulges out at mid latitudes. The center of the tachocline lies in the radiative zone at low latitudes, in the convection zone at intermediate latitudes, and back in the radiative zone at high latitudes. The high-latitude ($ > 60^\\circ$) behavior is, however, uncertain and model dependent. Models that allow more variation of the shape indicate that the tachocline at high latitudes is almost coincident with the base of the convection zone.",

Wilson Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) NASA's TESS mission has unveiled a plethora of eclipsing binaries (EBs), among them hundreds of triples and higher order, hierarchical systems. These complex targets require follow-up observations to enable full characterization of system architectures and identify the most compact multiples expected to undergo the most dramatic dynamical evolution. We report first results from a long-term effort to perform such follow-up, focusing here on multi-band speckle imaging of a majority, 57, of the sample of 97 quadruple and higher order eclipsing binaries (Q+EBs) identified via TESS light curves by V. B. Kostov et al. (2022). Diffraction-limited imaging with the Differential Speckle Survey Instrument (DSSI) on the ARC 3.5-meter telescope and HRCam on the SOAR 4.1-m telescope reveals nearly 60% of the 57 to resolve into two sources separated by $\\geq$ 0.03 arcseconds. For these partly resolved systems, we report derived characteristics (e.g., relative position angle, angular separation, and magnitude differences in multiple passbands) from the speckle imaging. We find those Q+EBs partly resolved with 4-m class telescopes to have significantly inflated Gaia parallax errors and large Gaia RUWE, particularly for systems with separations comparable to Gaia's resolution limit (~0.6 arcseconds). For unresolved systems we report upper limits on angular and linear projected separations. We find two partly resolved Q+EBs with wide linear separations having eclipse timing variations that are therefore candidates of higher than quadruple multiplicity. Finally, we demonstrate how speckle imaging of resolved Q+EBs during an eclipse can clarify which speckle-resolved Q+EB subsystem is associated with a particular set of TESS eclipses.",

Using high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of star formation in clouds with different physical properties, we study the initial distribution of stellar rotation periods in young clusters. We compare these results with observations of young Galactic clusters. Simulations qualitatively reproduce the observed trend of increasing rotation period with stellar mass. Additionally, simulations with lower virial parameter (ratio of turbulence to gravity) or solenoidal turbulence driving produce period-mass distributions that more closely match the observed ones. These simulations also recover the break in the mass-period relation. However, the break appears at higher masses than in observations and is absent in the youngest simulated clusters. This suggests that the emergence of the break is an important diagnostic of angular momentum evolution during the earliest stages of cluster formation. The simulations yield stars that rotate about an order of magnitude faster than those observed. This discrepancy mainly reflects the earlier evolutionary stage of the simulations, while unresolved physical interactions between stars and discs might also contribute. This conclusion is supported by simulations showing a significant period increase within 0.1-1 Myr. We quantify the required angular-momentum loss by rescaling simulated rotation periods to match observations, finding that 80-95% of the initial angular momentum must be removed within the first Myr. Our results highlight that understanding the earliest stages of star cluster formation is fundamental to addressing the angular momentum problem.",

Mills Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Multiplicity in pre-main-sequence (PMS) systems shapes circumstellar and circumbinary disks, often producing features such as inner cavities, spiral arms, and gas streamers that facilitate mass transfer between the disk and stars. Consequently, accretion in eccentric close binaries is highly variable and synchronized with their orbits, producing bursts near periastron passages. In this study, we examine the orbital and accretion properties of the eccentric Classical T-Tauri binary DQ Tau using medium- to high-resolution spectroscopy from the Very Large Telescope (VLT) X-Shooter and UVES instruments. The data were taken during a monitoring of inner disk chemistry with JWST, and our analysis is needed for correct interpretation of JWST data. We refine the orbital parameters and report an increment in the argument of periastron of 30 degrees. This apsidal motion may be caused by the massive disk acting as a third body. We also explore the possibility that it is due to a still undetected additional (sub-)stellar companion, estimating a lower limit of 15 MJ for its mass at the cavity edge (a=3 abin). We investigate accretion of the primary and secondary using the Ca II 849.8 nm emission line. The primary accretes more at periastron than in previous quiescent phases, while the secondary dominates post-periastron. Additionally, we report elevated Lacc at apastron, possibly due to interaction with irregularly shaped structures near the closest approach to the circumbinary disk. Finally, we derive each star's accretion luminosity across disentangled epochs and compare it to UV-excess-based results, finding good agreement. The individual Lacc values can be used as input for chemical models.",

Rapid rotation in massive stars leads to gravity darkening and oblateness, significantly affecting their radiation-driven winds. These effects can alter wind dynamics and play a role in forming slowly equatorial outflowing winds. Aims. This work investigates the transition region where the fast solution (i.e. high terminal velocities) of radiation-driven winds in a massive rotating star, in the frame of the modified-CAK theory, switches to the Omega-slow solutions (a denser and slower wind) when the effects of gravity darkening and oblateness are considered. This Omega-slow solution appears when the rotational speed is higher and equal to 75% of the critical rotation speed. Methods. To explore the transition region for various equatorial models of B-type stars, we focus on the co-existence interval where both solutions simultaneously exist and the transition point where fast solutions switch to Omega-slow solutions. Results. Using our stationary numerical code Hydwind, we first analyse the individual effects of gravity darkening and stellar oblateness caused by high rotational speeds and then examine their combined impact on the wind solutions. Conclusions. We find that for a certain range of rotational speeds, both the fast and Omega-slow solutions can co-exist, and the co-existence range strongly depends on the initial conditions. When only gravity darkening is considered, the co-existing interval shifts towards higher rotational speeds. While in the presence of the oblateness, the co-existing interval also occurs at higher rotational speeds; however, it is less than the gravity darkening effect. We also explored how line-force parameters affect the critical point, the location of the co-existing interval, and where the solution switches.",

Mandrai Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Similar to the solar cycle, the magnetic cycles of other solar-type stars are also variable. How the variability of the stellar cycle changes with the rotation rate or the dynamo number is a valuable information for understanding the stellar dynamo process. We examine the variability in the stellar magnetic cycles by studying 81 stars from the data of the Mount Wilson Observatory, which started observations in 1966. For 28 stars, we have time series data available till 2003, while for others, the data are limited till 1995. We specifically explore how the variability changes with respect to three rotation-related parameters. We find a modest positive correlation between the variability and the stellar rotation period. In addition, we find suggestive negative correlations between the variability and the inverse squared Rossby number ($Ro^{-2}$), and the ratio of the mean cycle duration and rotation period ($\\log \\, (\\langle P_{\\rm cyc} \\rangle / P_{\\rm rot})^2$). Variability computed from the magnetic field of stellar dynamo models also show similar trends. Finally, inspired by previous studies, we examine dynamo number scaling in our model data and find that $Ro^{-0.6}$ (instead of $Ro^{-2}$ as suggested in the linear $\\alpha \\Omega$ dynamo theory) and $(\\langle P_{\\rm cyc} \\rangle /P_{\\rm rot})^{0.6}$ (instead of $\\log \\, (\\langle P_{\\rm cyc} \\rangle / P_{\\rm rot})^2$ as predicted in previous observations) are a good measure of the dynamo number.

In this paper we fit the stellar spectral energy distributions of exoplanet hosts to measure their radii, making use of only archival photometry, the $Gaia$ parallaxes and $Gaia$ extinction maps. Using the extinction maps frees us of the degeneracy between temperature and extinction which has plagued this method in the past. The resulting radii have typical random uncertainties of about 2 per cent. We perform a quantitative study of systematic uncertainties affecting the methodology and find they are similar to, or smaller than, the random ones. We discuss how the stellar parameters can be used to derive the properties of both transiting exoplanets, and those where only a radial-velocity curve is available. We then explore in detail the improvements the method makes possible for the parameters of the PanCET sample of transiting planets. For this sample we find the best literature measurements of the planetary radii have mean uncertainties about 40 per cent larger than those presented here, with the new measurements achieving precisions of 2 per cent in radius and 10 per cent in mass. In contrast to much recent work, these transiting exoplanets parameters are derived without using theoretical models of stellar interiors, freeing them of the assumptions those models contain, and any priors for stellar age. As the data used are available for the whole sky, the method can be used for self-consistent measurements of the planetary parameters of a very large fraction of known exoplanets.",

Brightness asymmetries (e.g. starspots) rotating in and out of view can also cause apparent motion of the photocenter, termed astrometric jitter, that has previously been considered a source of noise. Here, we explore whether it can be used to map stellar surfaces. We derive a Cramer-Rao bound on the minimum variance for which a stellar surface can theoretically be estimated, quantifying the information content in rotational astrometric jitter. To regularize and break singularities in the Fisher information, we impose a spatial-smoothness Gaussian-Markov random field prior. A key challenge in mapping surfaces arises for stars with unknown rotational axis inclinations, requiring joint estimation of the inclination and the stellar surface. We characterize the coupling between them and quantify the precision gain when inclination is known versus unknown.",

However, this pipeline provides, on average, only a few tens of minutes of lead time, which decreases to $\\sim$30 minutes or less for large solar wind speeds of $\\sim$800 km/s and above. The G5 geomagnetic storm of 2024 May provided an opportunity to test predictions generated employing real-time data from the STEREO-A spacecraft, placed 13° west of Earth and 0.04 au closer to the Sun than L1 at the time of the event, as shown recently by Weiler et al.

By applying mipmapping (local recursive spatial averaging) and sparse voxel grids, we exploit spatial coherence and sparsity in astrophysical models to accelerate the formal solution of the radiative transfer equation. We introduce a variance-limited mipmapping (VLM) scheme with tunable error control, and extend it to handle anisotropic emission via two methods: velocity interpolation, and so-called \"Core and Voigt\". Our approach integrates a hierarchical digital differential analyzer (HDDA) for efficient ray traversal, which, combined with the mipmapping scheme achieves an order of magnitude speedup with less than 0.5 % error in the 99.9th percentile of the level populations. These methods are implemented in the DexRT code and demonstrate significant performance gains in realistic solar atmospheric models.",

Young Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) Quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) at the Sun are created from regions where channels of open magnetic flux have footpoints near regions of large-scale closed magnetic flux. These regions are particularly prone to magnetic reconnection at the Sun. In recent simulations of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) with the Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS) model coupled to the Energetic Particle Radiation Environment Module (EPREM) model, common sources of energetic particles were discovered over broad longitudinal distributions in the background solar wind, far from the sites of particle acceleration driven by compressions and shocks in front of CMEs. Further investigation revealed these to be accelerated energetic particles from the QSLs and current sheets. The energy released from magnetic reconnection near the QSL drives reconnection exhausts and field-aligned flows, which in turn accelerate energetic particles. The reconnection process also releases material previously contained within closed magnetic field structures, which are often rich in heavy ions and $^3$He ions, as corroborated by recent PSP observations. Therefore, the seed populations produced by QSLs are expected to be rich in $^3$He and heavy ions. Thus, we present the first global model of energetic particles accelerated from QSLs and above current sheets from the Sun. Our results provide a plausible source for seed populations near the Sun, which likely have $^3$He and heavy ion enhancements. These results aid in the development of predictive solar energetic particle models.",

Properties of this fundamental process are poorly described near the solar poles. Here we report the first out-of-ecliptic remote-sensing observations of the south pole of the Sun from a high-latitude campaign of the Solar Orbiter spacecraft which reveal spatial and temporal evolution of supergranular convective cells. The supergranular cells have spatial scales of 20--40 Mm. From eight days of observations starting on 2025 March 16, our analysis shows that the magnetic network migrates poleward, on average, at high latitudes (above 60\\textdegree), with speeds in the range of 10--20 m s$^{-1}$, depending on the structures being tracked. These results shed light on the buildup of the polar magnetic field that is central to our understanding of the solar cycle and the heliospheric magnetic field.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) How planetary systems form and evolve is a key question in astronomy. Revealing how host star properties, such as elemental abundances, age, and mass, differ from those of non-host stars, and how they correlate with planetary characteristics such as radius, provides new insights into the formation and evolutionary pathways of planetary systems. We determine precise ages for 18890 dwarfs and subgiants from the LAMOST-Kepler-Gaia sample with a mean age uncertainty of about 15 percent (median about 10 percent). Within the framework of Galactic chemical evolution, we find that about 86 percent of planet-hosting stars younger than 8 Gyr occupy the upper branch ([Fe/H] > -0.2) of the characteristic V-shaped age-metallicity relation of the Galactic disk. Based on guiding radii (Rg), we further infer that about 19 percent of these young hosts likely originated in the inner disk and subsequently migrated to the solar neighborhood. Among stars older than 10 Gyr, host stars tend to be more metal-rich, with nearly 59 percent having [Fe/H] > -0.2. This suggests that both young and old planet-hosting stars preferentially form in relatively metal-rich environments. However, for host stars with [Fe/H] < -0.2, we find that their metallicities are on average lower by about 0.16 dex compared to non-host stars of similar age and mass, indicating that [Fe/H] is unlikely to be the dominant factor governing planet formation in metal-poor environments. We also identify a systematic depletion of volatile elements, especially carbon, in planet hosts. Moreover, host star [Fe/H] exhibits a weak correlation with planet radius, while [alpha/Fe] primarily support the formation of small planets.",

Although machine learning models have advanced solar energetic particle (SEP) event prediction using GOES data, the sudden yet sparse nature of SEP events necessitates high-quality proton flux measurements. Previous studies have identified contamination issues in GOES data, when the presence of higher-energy protons can cause parasitic signals in lower-energy GOES channels and lead to artificially elevated fluxes in lower energy ranges (e.g., 10 - 50 MeV). As of now, no universal correction method has been implemented for the publicly available NOAA data. In addition, the effects of Earth's magnetosphere on the 10 - 50 MeV particles are not fully understood yet. This study assesses a reconstruction method using concurrent solar proton event (SPE) measurements from SOHO-EPHIN, which align well with GOES measurements of SPEs across solar cycles 23 and the bulk of cycle 24, but represent the off-magnetospheric environment of the Lagrange 1 point. We train regression models on GOES proton fluxes across multiple energy bins, employing EPHIN fluxes as prediction targets. We expect that similar approaches can allow us to derive non-contaminated flux proxies that preserve valuable data and more accurately capture the characteristics of SPEs, providing a more stable dataset for analyzing SEP behavior and potentially improving SEP event prediction models.",

Pereira 20 pages, 13 figures and 4 tabls. Accepted in the ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Although triple systems are common, their orbital dynamics and stellar evolution remain poorly understood. We investigated the V1371 Tau system using TESS photometry, multi-epoch spectroscopy, and recent interferometric data, confirming it as a rare triple system consisting of an eclipsing binary orbited by a classical Be star, with a spectral classification of (B1V + B0V) + B0Ve. The eclipsing binary exhibits an orbital period of approximately 34 days, and the Be star orbits the inner pair on a timescale of a few years. Weak H$\\alpha$ emission lines suggest the presence of a Keplerian disk with variability on a timescale of months around the Be star, and a nearly constant V/R ratio with no detectable asymmetry variations. Besides the eclipses, frequencies at 0.24 and 0.26 c/d dominate the photometric variability. Higher-frequency signals are present which appear associated with non-radial pulsation. The eclipsing pair ($i \\approx 90^\\circ$) shows projected rotational velocities of 160 and 200 km s$^{-1}$. The Be star's measured $v \\sin i \\approx 250$ km s$^{-1}$ implies a critical rotation fraction between 0.44 and 0.76 for plausible inclinations, significantly faster than the eclipsing components. The shallower eclipses in the KELT data compared to TESS suggest a variation in orbital inclination, possibly induced by Kozai-Lidov cycles from the outer Be star. The evolution analysis suggests that all components are massive main-sequence stars, with the secondary star in the eclipsing binary being overluminous. This study emphasizes the complexity of triple systems with Be stars and provides a basis for future research on their formation, evolution, and dynamics.",

This paper introduces LRPayne, a novel algorithm designed for the efficient determination of stellar parameters and chemical abundances from low-resolution optical spectra, with a primary focus on data from large-scale galactic surveys such as WEAVE. Methods. LRPayne employs a model-driven approach, utilising a fully connected artificial neural network (ANN), trained on a library of 70,000 synthetic stellar spectra generated using iSpec with 1D MARCS model atmospheres and the Turbospectrum synthesis code. The network is trained to predict normalized flux given stellar labels (Teff, log(g), [Fe/H], vmic, vmax and v sin i, and 24 individual elemental abundances). Stellar parameters are subsequently derived from observed spectra by finding the best-fit synthetic spectrum from the ANN using a chi-squared minimisation technique. The method operates on spectra degraded to a resolution of R=5000 covering the wavelength range 4200-6900 Å. Results. Internal accuracy tests on synthetic spectra show a median interpolation error of less than 0.13 % for 90 % of the validation sample. The method accurately recovers most input labels from synthetic spectra, even at a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 20, with some expected challenges for elements like Li, K, and N. Validation on observed spectra of 25 Gaia FGK benchmark stars and 42 metal-poor stars reveals good agreement with literature values. For stellar parameters, mean differences are 22+-87 K for Teff , 0.19+-0.23 dex for log(g), and 0.01+-0.17 dex for [Fe/H]. Abundances for elements like Na, Mg, Si, and most Fe-peak elements (Cr, Ni, V, Sc) are well-recovered. Challenges are noted for oxygen, manganese in metal-rich giants, aluminium in metal-poor stars and dwarfs, and for deriving log g in hot metal-poor dwarfs, partly due to non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects and line characteristics.",

      "abstract": "A Unified Model and Optimization for Deep Space Radiation Shielding Based on Proton Density Li Zhenchao, Yang Aixiang Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex); Applied Physics (physics.app-ph) In the field of deep space radiation shielding design, traditional high-Z metals are being progressively replaced by novel low-Z materials such as hydrogenated graphene foam, polyethylene-carbon nanotube composite fibers, and boron-rich hydrogen-containing metal-organic frameworks. This transition stems from the constraints of the \"gram-scale weight reduction\" bottleneck. However, the mechanisms behind these materials' outstanding \"lightweight performance\" remain at the purely phenomenological level. To address this issue, this paper innovatively proposes a ternary coupled semi-empirical model, with \"proton density\" (rho_p) as the core independent variable (equivalent to electron density), establishing correlations with full absorption threshold (Eth) and proton utilization rate (eta_p). To validate the model's practicality in complex system design, we embedded it into the NSGA-II genetic algorithm (POP=20, MAXGEN=10). Under constraints of 2-5 layer structures with total thickness <=1 cm, the model's predicted optimal solutions showed an average design error of only 6.2%-8.2% compared to Geant4 heavy simulation dose results. This study provides the first quantitative physical explanation of the inherent trade-off between low-Z materials' \"mass savings\" and high-Z materials' \"space savings.\" When rho_p<1 mol cm^-3, materials demonstrate extremely high proton utilization rates (eta_p reaching 60-100 MeV cm^-2 mol^-1), achieving 35%-55% mass savings. Conversely, when rho_p>1 mol cm^-3, although eta_p drops below 30 MeV cm^-2 mol^-1, its exceptionally high full absorption threshold (Eth) enables ultra-thin shielding technology. This work offers a robust, physically interpretable, and scalable design tool for multi-objective optimization of area density, thickness, and dose in deep space missions.",

We present a new method that allows simultaneous measurement of the size and velocity of the largest high-velocity ejecta. High-speed camera images revealed the time required for the ejecta to reach the secondary target, and ejecta size was determined after the experiment by analyzing the craters formed upon their impact on the secondary target. We defined the size-velocity relationships of sub-millimeter ejecta with velocities exceeding 1 km^{-1}, focusing on the largest detectable ejecta in our experiments. The results show that millimeter-sized meteoroids impacting the rocky surfaces of planetary bodies at 7 km^{-1} eject particles up to a few tens of micrometers in size toward interplanetary space at velocities exceeding the escape velocity of the body, even when it is greater than 1 km^{-1}.",

The amplitude and phase modulations are typically implemented with additional RF components that require drive or control electronics. For the RF system-on-chip (RFSoC) based next generation LLRF (NG-LLRF) platform, which we have developed in the last several years, RF modulation and demodulation are fully implemented in the digital domain. Therefore, arbitrary RF pulse shaping can be realized without any additional analogue components. We performed a range of high-power experiments with the NG-LLRF and a prototype Cool Copper Collider (C\\(^3\\)) structure. In this paper, the RF field measured at different stages with different pulse shapes and peak power levels up to 16.45 MW will be demonstrated and analyzed. The high precision pulse shaping schemes of the NG-LLRF can be applied to realize the phase modulation for a linear accelerator injector, the phase reversal for a pulse compressor, or the modulation required to compensate for the beam loading effect.",

Yahalomi, David Kipping, Eric Agol, David Nesvorny 15 pages, 5 figures, accepted to ApJL Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Transit timing variations (TTVs) are observed for exoplanets at a range of amplitudes and periods, yielding an ostensibly degenerate forest of possible explanations. We offer some clarity in this forest, showing that systems with a distant perturbing planet preferentially show TTVs with a dominant period equal to either the perturbing planet's period or half the perturbing planet's period. We demonstrate that planet induced TTVs are not expected with dominant TTV periods below this exoplanet edge (lower period limit) and that systems with TTVs that fall below this limit likely contain additional mass in the system. We present an explanation for both of these periods, showing that both aliasing of the conjunction induced synodic period and the near $1:2$ resonance super-period and tidal effects induce TTVs at periods equal to either the perturber's orbit or half-orbit. We provide three examples of known systems for which the recovered TTV period induced by a distant perturbing planet is equal to the perturber's orbital period or half its orbital period. We then investigate \\textit{Kepler} two-planet systems with TTVs and identify 13 two-planet systems with TTVs below this TTV period lower limit -- thus potentially uncovering the gravitational influence of new planets and/or moons. We conclude by discussing how the exoplanet edge effects can be used to predict the presence of distance companion planets, in situations where TTVs are detected and where nearby companions can be ruled out by additional observations, such as radial velocity data.",

(2011) as a visual overdensity of objects with low ecliptic inclinations and eccentricities at semimajor axes near 44 AU. This raises the question - are there other structures present in the classical Kuiper belt? If there are, clustering algorithms applied to orbits transformed into free elements may yield the best chance of discovery. Here, we derive barycentric free orbital elements for objects in the classical Kuiper belt, and use the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to identify a new structure, which we dub the inner kernel, located at $a \\sim 43 \\mathrm{\\; AU}$ just inward of the kernel ($a \\sim 44 \\mathrm{\\; AU}$), which we also recover. It is yet unclear whether the inner kernel is an extension of the kernel or a distinct structure. Forthcoming observations, including those by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) may provide further evidence for the existence of this structure, and perhaps resolve the question of whether there are two distinct structures.",

A proposed subset, Hycean planets, would have liquid water oceans and be potentially habitable, but there are many unanswered questions about their atmospheric dynamics and 3D climate states. To explore such climates in detail, we report a General Circulation Model (GCM) for Hycean worlds, building on a modified version of the ExoCAM GCM. Considering the temperate sub-Neptune K2-18 b as a Hycean candidate, we implement GCMs with different surface pressures and albedos. We find dynamical structures similar to those of tidally-locked terrestrial planets as `slow rotators' with either one equatorial or twin mid-latitude zonal jets. We see moist convective inhibition that matches high resolution models, although in hotter cases the inhibited zone is subsaturated. When imposing a top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) Bond albedo ($A_b$) by modifying the incident stellar flux, we find that the threshold for K2-18~b to not enter a runaway greenhouse state is $A_b \\geq 0.55$ for a 1 bar atmosphere, consistent with previous studies, and $A_b \\geq 0.8$ for a 5 bar atmosphere. However, a more realistic treatment of the albedo, by modelling scattering within the atmosphere using an enhanced Rayleigh parametrisation, leads to lower lapse rates and stronger thermal inversions. We find that 1 bar atmospheres are stable for an albedo of $A_b \\geq 0.27$, 5 bar atmospheres for $A_b \\geq 0.35$, and 10 bar atmospheres for $A_b \\geq 0.48$. Moderate albedos such as these are typical of the solar system planets and the required scattering is consistent with observational constraints for K2-18~b, supporting its plausibility as a Hycean world.",

Strampelli, S. Hinkley, G. Kennedy, A. D. James, J. Milli, S. Ray 17 pages, 12 figures, accepted by A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We present the first observations of the HD92945 debris disk obtained with JWST, targeting this nearby K0V star located at 21.54 pc from the Sun. High-contrast coronagraphic imaging was performed using JWST/NIRCam in the F200W and F444W filters. After subtracting the disk contribution through forward modeling by means of synthetic PSFs and MCMC optimizations, the residuals were analyzed to identify candidate point sources. From these, we derived contrast curves and constructed detection probability maps for substellar companions. The disk is clearly detected in both NIRCam filters and reveals a broad, inclined structure with a gap, consistent with previous scattered-light and ALMA observations. The modeling confirms the presence of a gap at ~80 au and shows a scale height and scattering properties compatible with a dynamically active disk. A significant brightness asymmetry is observed in the southwestern inner ring at both 2 and 4.4 {\\mu}m, consistent with previous ALMA results. Observing this feature across different wavelengths and epochs strongly supports a scenario where one or more unseen planetary companions are perturbing the disk. No comoving sources are detected, and all candidate objects in the field are consistent with background stars or galaxies. The derived detection limits exclude planets more massive than ~0.4-0.5 MJ beyond 100 au and more massive than ~1 MJ beyond 20-40 au. This, in turn, rules out the possibility of a single planet placed beyond ~20 au as responsible for the astrometric signal observed by Gaia. These results, combined with the observed disk features, support a scenario in which a single or multiple sub-Jupiter planets dynamically shape the system through mechanisms such as secular apsidal resonances, providing a coherent explanation for the gap, the asymmetric brightness distribution and the astrometric signal.",

Kennedy, Alvaro Ribas, Enrique Macias, John Carpenter, Miguel Vioque, Kevin Luhman, Thomas Haworth, Philipp Weber, Sebastian Perez, Alice Zurlo Abstract metadata edited for character limit Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Intermediate-mass stars (1-3 Msun) host some of the brightest and best-studied debris discs. This stellar class is also the most frequent host of molecular gas in systems older than typical protoplanetary disc lifetimes, and the most likely to host detected giant planets in radial-velocity surveys. The debris discs of intermediate-mass stars have therefore become fertile ground for studying disc-planet interactions. In this work, we present the first ALMA observations toward the A-type star HD 126062, located in Upper Centaurus Lupus / Lower Centaurus Crux, with the aim of characterising its debris disc. We probed the thermal continuum emission using observations at 1.3 mm, analysed through image reconstruction under different visibility-weighting regimes and parametric model fitting to the observed visibilities. The setup also covered the frequency of the 12CO(2-1) line, allowing imaging of gas near the system. We detected dust continuum emission from an exo-Kuiper belt around HD 126062. Modelled as a Gaussian ring, the visibilities are consistent with a radial separation R = 2.01'' (+0.04, -0.05), equivalent to ~270 (+5, -4) au, and a full width at half maximum DeltaR = 0.71'' +- 0.09 (95 +- 12 au). The continuum emission appears nearly face-on, with inclination <=17 deg. 12CO(2-1) emission is detected in the vicinity of the debris disc, with most of it located external to the exo-Kuiper belt. The exo-Kuiper belt characterised here is among the largest yet detected and agrees with previous predictions of the dust distribution based on spectral energy distribution fitting. The morphology and velocity offset relative to the systemic velocity suggest that the gas is not associated with the star or disc, but likely originates from a diffuse cloud in the nearby galaxy.",

Ciesla 15 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in ApJL Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Giant planet atmospheres are thought to reflect the gas phase composition of the disk when and where they formed. However, these atmospheres may also be polluted via solid accretion or ice sublimation in the disk. Here, we propose a novel mechanism for enriching the atmospheres of these giant planets with volatiles via pebble drift, fragmentation, and ice sublimation. We use a combination of 3D hydrodynamic simulations, radiative transfer, and particle tracking to follow the trajectories and resulting temperatures of solids in a disk containing an embedded planet forming outside the CO snowline. We show that small dust can become entrained in the meridional flows created by the giant planet and advected above the disk midplane where temperatures are well above the sublimation temperature of CO. This transport of small grains occurs over 10 kyr timescales, with individual micron-sized grains cycling between the midplane and surface of the disk multiple times throughout the planetary accretion stage. We find that this stirring of dust results in sublimation of CO gas above the snow surface in the dust trap created exterior to the giant planet, leading to super-solar CO abundances in the pressure bump. This mechanism of Dust Recycling and Icy Volatile Enrichment in cold giant planets, which we call the DRIVE effect, may explain enhanced metallicities of both wide separation exoplanets as well as Jupiter in our own Solar System.",

We present a generalization of the classical isothermal, isobaric transmission model by allowing the opacity to vary with pressure as a power law, $\\kappa \\propto P^{n}$, and explicitly defining the reference opacity $\\kappa_{0}$ at a chosen pressure $P_{0}$. By treating the slant optical depth as an Abel transform of the radial absorption coefficient, we derive a closed-form expression for the effective transit radius in a hydrostatic, isothermal atmosphere with pressure-dependent opacity. The solution provides a compact framework for exploring non-isobaric effects and explicitly links the vertical opacity gradient to observable spectral features. We benchmark the model against empirical transmission spectra of Earth and the hot Jupiter WASP-39b, finding a significantly improved fit relative to the isobaric formula. This generalized expression offers a physically interpretable foundation for analyzing high-precision spectra from JWST and upcoming ARIEL observations, and can serve as a basis for semi-analytical retrieval approaches optimized for computational efficiency.",

Their anomalously-inflated radii, along with recent JWST atmospheric observations, suggest a source of internal heating. Because these planets are nominally too cool to be affected by the hot Jupiter inflation mechanism, dissipation of eccentricity tides within the planet has been proposed as a leading explanation for the source of this heat flux. Using the MAROON-X spectrograph on Gemini-North, we conducted a high-precision radial-velocity campaign to precisely measure the eccentricities of three of these popcorn planets: WASP-107 b, TOI-1173 b, and HAT-P-18 b. We constrained their eccentricities below $e < 0.03$--$0.05$ to 95% confidence, decisively ruling out active heating from eccentricity tides as the cause of these planets' inflated radii (except for the unlikely scenario in which their tidal quality factors are less than the Earth's). An alternative heating mechanism is likely responsible for inflating these planets. Our measurements also provide new constraints on $e\\cos\\omega$, significantly shrinking the eclipse timing uncertainties to better than $\\pm2.5$ hr and allowing for confident scheduling of thermal emission measurements for these enigmatic planets.",

Tarduno, Ilaria Pascucci Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics. This version removes referee formatting (no line numbers). Data available at Zenodo: this https URL Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Metal-rich asteroids and iron meteorites are considered core remnants of differentiated planetesimals and or products of oxygen-depleted accretion. Investigating the origins of iron-rich planetesimals could provide key insights into planet formation mechanisms. Using differentiation models, we evaluate the interior structure and composition of representative-sized planetesimals (approx. 200 km diameter) while varying oxygen fugacity and initial bulk meteoritic composition. Under the oxygen-poor conditions that likely existed early in the inner regions of the Solar System and other protoplanetary disks, core fractions remain relatively consistent across a range of bulk compositions (CI, H, EH, and CBa). Some of these cores could incorporate significant amounts of silicon (10-30 wt percent) and explain the metal fractions of Fe-rich bodies in the absence of mantle stripping. Conversely, planetesimals forming under more oxidizing conditions, such as beyond snow lines, could exhibit smaller cores enriched in carbon, sulfur (more than 1 wt percent), and oxides. Sulfur-rich cores, like those formed from EH and H bulk compositions, could remain partly molten, sustain dynamos, and even drive sulfur-rich volcanism. Additionally, bodies with high carbon contents, such as CI compositions, can form graphitic outer layers. These variations highlight the importance of initial formation conditions in shaping planetesimal structures. Future missions, such as NASA's Psyche mission, offer an opportunity to measure the relative abundances of key elements (Fe, Ni, Si, and S) necessary to distinguish among formation scenarios and structure models for Fe-rich and reduced planetesimals.",

Abell, Jean-Baptiste Vincent, Iulian Petrişor, Patrick Michel 33 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in Space Science Reviews Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The HyperScout-H (HS-H) instrument is one of the payloads aboard ESA's Hera spacecraft. Hera is a planetary defence mission that aims to provide a detailed characterization of the near-Earth binary asteroid (65803) Didymos-Dimorphos after the NASA/DART mission impact. HS-H is a versatile dual-use payload, functioning as a hyperspectral imager that captures both images and spectral data within the 0.65--0.95 $\\mu$m wavelength range. The observations from this instrument will offer key insights regarding the composition of the two bodies Didymos and Dimorphos, space weathering effects, and the potential presence of exogenous material on these asteroids. Thanks to its wide field of view ($\\approx 15.5^\\circ \\times 8.3^\\circ$ in paraxial approximation), HS-H will be able to monitor the system's orbital dynamic and dust environment. At the same time, both components of this binary asteroid remain in the field of view for most of the asteroid phase of the mission. These results also complement the data obtained from other instruments in characterizing the geomorphological units. The data that will be obtained by HS-H will enable the creation of maps highlighting key spectral features, such as taxonomic classification, spectral slope, and band parameters. This article presents the pre-flight calibration of the instrument, outlines the science objectives, and discusses the expected investigations. The instrument's capabilities are demonstrated through laboratory observations of two meteorite samples and a dedicated software toolbox was developed specifically for processing the instrument's data.",

Woillez (the MATISSE Collaboration) 28 pages, 23 figures, to be published in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The T-Tauri type young stellar object RY Tau exhibits a dust depleted inner cavity characteristic of a transition disk. We constrain the spatial distribution and mineralogy of dust in the RY Tau protoplanetary disk in the inner few astronomical units using spectrally resolved interferometric observations in the L, M, and N bands obtained with VLTI/MATISSE. Employing a 2D temperature gradient model we estimate the orientation of the inner disk finding no evidence of significant misalignment between the inner and outer disk of RY Tau. Successively, we analyze the chemical composition of silicates depending on spatial region in the disk and identify several silicate species commonly found in protoplanetary disks. Additionally, a depletion of amorphous dust grains toward the central protostar is observed. Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations show that hot dust close to the protostar and in the line of sight to the observer, either in the uppermost disk layers of a strongly flared disk or in a dusty envelope, is necessary to model the observations. The shadow cast by a dense innermost disk midplane on the dust further out explains the observed closure phases in the L band and to some extent in the M band. However, the closure phases in the N band are underestimated by our model, hinting at an additional asymmetry in the flux density distribution not visible at shorter wavelengths.",

Flemming, Callum Hetherington, Bo Zhao, Can Yildirim, Carsten Detlefs Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) We present a multiscale microstructural analysis of olivine from the non-poikilitic lithology of the poikilitic shergottite NWA 7721, using dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and context in situ 2D micro-XRD. A single olivine crystal contains two distinct subgrain populations. Type 1 subgrains are fine (1-5 micrometers), randomly oriented, and nearly strain-free, whereas Type 2 subgrains are coarse (greater than 30 micrometers), aligned, and strongly strained. Layered DFXM data reveal slip-band features in Type 2 that are absent in Type 1. We interpret Type 1 as products of shock-induced recrystallization, whereas Type 2 preserves remnants of a highly deformed parent grain. This bimodal microstructure, not observed in other Martian meteorites including the paired NWA 1950 and ALH A77005, points to a heterogeneous response to impact influenced by pre-existing strain in the olivine grain. We propose that NWA 7721 olivine experienced substantial crustal or magmatic stress before impact. The subsequent shock wave imposed a rapid load-release cycle that mobilized dislocations and produced low-angle boundaries in Type 2, while driving recrystallization of Type 1. Grain-growth constraints limit the post-shock heating duration to approximately 2.3 s, consistent with rapid quenching. These results provide the first evidence that non-poikilitic olivine in NWA 7721 preserves dynamic crustal deformation on Mars in the Late Amazonian.",

Zingales 27 pages, 20 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We provide a detailed characterisation of the planetary system orbiting HD 85426 (TOI-1774). This bright G-type star ($M_{\\ast}$: 0.99 $\\text{M}_{\\odot}$; $R_{\\ast}$: 1.13 $\\text{R}_{\\odot}$; age: 7.4 Gyr; V mag: 8.25) hosts a transiting sub-Neptune, HD 85426 b, with an orbital period of 16.71 days and a blackbody equilibrium temperature of $824^{+11}_{-11}$ K. By jointly analysing HARPS-N RVs, TESS, and CHEOPS photometric data and using two different stellar activity mitigation techniques, we constrain planet b's mass to $6.0^{+1.5}_{-1.6}$ $\\text{M}_{\\oplus}$ and $8.5^{+1.3}_{-1.4} $ $\\text{M}_{\\oplus}$, depending on the mitigation technique. We investigate the dependence of these results on the priors, data selection, and inclusion of other Keplerians in the modelling. Using this approach, we identify the presence of two non-transiting planetary companions with minimum masses near 10 $\\text{M}_{\\oplus}$ and orbital periods of 35.7 and 89 days. Additionally, we reject the initial hypothesis that the 35.7-day periodic signal was due to stellar activity. We also determine HD 85426 b's radius to be $2.78^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ $\\text{R}_{\\oplus}$ and compute a transmission spectroscopy metric in the range of 82 to 115, making this planet a highly valuable target for atmospheric characterisation.",

Turyshev Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Lunar dust -- the sub-millimeter fraction of the regolith -- controls the optical, thermophysical, electrical, mechanical, and environmental behavior of the Moon's surface. These properties set the performance envelopes of remote-sensing retrievals, regolith geotechnics, volatile cycles, and exploration systems, while also posing operational and biomedical risks. We synthesize Apollo sample analyses and in-situ observations (Surveyor, Lunokhod, Apollo) with contemporary datasets from the LRO Diviner Lunar Radiometer, the LADEE/LDEX exospheric dust measurements, and Chang'e-4 Lunar Penetrating Radar (LPR). We also incorporate 2024-2025 results: Chandrayaan-3 ChaSTE thermophysics at the Vikram lander's site, SCALPSS plume-surface diagnostics from Intuitive Machines Mission 1 (IM-1), and Negative Ions at the Lunar Surface (NILS) detections of a dayside near-surface H$^{-}$ population on Chang'e-6. The review links (i) production and modification processes to (ii) grain-scale physical/chemical/electrical/optical/mechanical properties, then to (iii) mobilization pathways (meteoroid ejecta, electrostatic hopping, rocket-plume entrainment), and finally to (iv) region-specific design ranges across maria, highlands, pyroclastic units, magnetic swirls, and permanently shadowed regions (PSRs). We quantify temperature-illumination dependence across day/night and PSR-equator regimes through a two-channel $k(T,\\rho)$ model and charge-relaxation scaling. We provide closed-form expressions for adhesion-aware lift thresholds and for near-surface (0-3~m) dust transport at apex/hover heights as functions of sheath structure.

Muñoz-Gutiérrez, Antranik A. Sefilian, Antonio Peimbert 15 pages, 8 figures. Accepted for publication in MNRAS Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Dynamical interactions between planets and debris discs can excite the orbits of embedded planetesimals to such a degree that a collisional cascade is triggered, generating detectable amounts of dust. Millimetre wavelength observations are sensitive to emission from large and cold dust grains, which are unperturbed by radiation forces and act as a proxy for the location of the planetesimals. The influence of unseen planetary companions on debris discs can be inferred with high-resolution imaging observations at millimetre wavelengths, tracing the radial and vertical structure of these belts. Here we present a set of $N$-body simulations modelling ALMA observations of the HD~16743 debris disc. We consider a range of relative contributions from either a single planetary companion and/or a set of embedded massive planetesimals to reproduce the disc's observed radial and vertical structure. We compare our dynamical results for the limiting cases of planet-stirring and self-stirring, finding them to be consistent with theoretical expectations for each scenario. For the case of HD~16743, we find that a set of massive planetesimals on mildly eccentric orbits, confined to a relatively narrow range of semimajor axes (compared to the observed belt width), offers the best results to reproduce the vertical and radial extent of the observed emission. Our findings constrain the total planet-disk system mass. A combined giant and dwarf planet mass of $\\geq~27~M_{\\oplus}$ can reproduce the observed architecture, with the equipartition scenario requiring only half the disc mass of the self-stirring scenario.",

(2025b) arXiv:2509.26617 (§2.4.2), centrifugal radius (§2.4.3), vphi (after Eq. 4); added references; clarified some conclusions. The delay between submission and revision was entirely due to me Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Direct-imaging surveys have looked for accreting planets through their accretion tracers such as H alpha but have been less fruitful than expected. However, up to now, hydrogen-line emission at accreting planets has been estimated primarily with extrapolations of stellar-scaling relationships or with theoretical spherically-symmetric computations. To predict the line emission intensity during the formation phase, we follow the consequences of angular momentum conservation of the material accreting onto a gas giant in a protoplanetary disc. We focus on the limiting case that magnetospheric accretion does not occur, which yields a conservative estimate of the line emission and should correspond to certain epochs during formation. We extend but simplify an existing analytical description of the multidimensional gas flow onto an accreting gas giant, the ballistic infall model, and combine this with detailed shock emission models. Applying this to data from a global planet formation model, we confirm that the line-emitting accretion rate is a minuscule fraction of the gas inflow into the Hill sphere. Also, forming planets are mostly fainter than PDS 70 b and c or WISPIT 2 b, with a maximum H alpha line luminosity Lline near 1e-7 Lsol, roughly independent of planet mass. Most surveys have not been sensitive to such faint planets. Other hydrogen lines in the NIR are fainter by 1--2 dex. This implies that accreting planets are fainter than from past estimates, such that the non-detections are not as constraining as thought. A deeper look closer in to the host stars could well reveal many forming super-Jupiters.",
