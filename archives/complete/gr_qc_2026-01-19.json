      "abstract": "Multibanded Reduced Order Quadrature Techniques for Gravitational Wave Inference Murdoc Newell, Alexis Boudon, Hong Qi General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Reduced-order quadrature (ROQ) is commonly used to speed up parameter estimation in gravitational wave astronomy; however, the construction of ROQ bases can be computationally costly, particularly for longer duration signals. We propose a modified construction strategy based on PyROQ that accelerates this process by performing the basis search using multiband waveforms, without compromising the desired likelihood speed and accuracy. We use this altered method to construct a set of ROQs in the sub-solar mass range using the \\texttt{IMRPhenomXAS\\_NRTidalV3} waveform. We find a 20\\% to 30\\% decrease in basis size and a $\\sim 10$ times decrease in basis construction time. We verify the altered method preserves the likelihood accuracy and mantains consitent parameter estimation results.",

      "abstract": "Quantum Optical Inspired Models for Unitary Black Hole Evaporation Paul M. Alsing General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph) In this work, we describe optically inspired models for unitary black hole (BH) evaporation. The goal of these models are (i) to be operationally simple, (ii) approximately preserve the thermal nature of the emitted Hawking Radiation (HR), and (iii) attempt to reproduce the Page Curve that purports that information flows forth from the BH when it has evaporated to approximately half its initial mass. We concentrate on modeling the BH as a single mode squeezed state successively interacting, by means of beam splitters and squeezers, with vacuum modes near the horizon, giving rise to entangled pairs representing the external Hawking radiation and its partner particle inside the horizon. Since all states and operations are Gaussian throughout, we use a symplectic formalism to track the evolution of the composite system through the evolving means and variances of their quadrature operators. This allows us to easily compute correlations and entanglement between the BH and the HR, as well as calculate correlations between the BH at early and late times.",

We analyze the behavior of charged particles in this geometry and find that the spacetime structure itself responds non-monotonically to the background magnetic field $B$. Specifically, both the event horizon and the static limit surface first expand as $B$ increases, reach a maximum size at an intermediate field strength, and then contract toward the extremal limit. Although the ergoregion itself shrinks monotonically with $B$, this structural feature gives rise to a pronounced non-monotonic dependence of the energy extraction efficiency on the magnetic field $B$, i.e., the efficiency initially rises, attains a maximum value, and subsequently falls as the extremal condition is approached. This contrasts sharply with the monotonic trends usually associated with magnetic enhancements in the Kerr geometry. We further explore an astrophysical application of the MPP by estimating the maximum energy of electrons escaping from the ergoregion of the KBR BH. Modeling neutron beta decay occurring near the event horizon, we derive an analytical expression for the energy gained by electrons accelerated by the magnetic field. Applying our results to the supermassive BH at the Galactic center, $\\mathrm{SgrA}^*$, we find that electrons can be accelerated up to energies of $\\sim 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ for realistic values of the spin and magnetic field. Although these energies exceed the observed upper range of cosmic-ray electrons, radiative losses such as synchrotron emission and inverse-Compton scattering can efficiently reduce them to the observed $\\mathrm{TeV}$ scale.",

Maurya, Aaisha Al Qassabi, B.

Using a numerical approach, we solve these equations for pressureless matter, predicting the redshift evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis, incorporating late-time observations from Cosmic Chronometers, Pantheon$^+$ with SH0ES, and DESI BAO (Data Release 1 and Data Release 2), constrains the model parameters, revealing that $f(T, T_{\\mathcal{G}})$ mimics dark energy in the absence of a cosmological constant, presenting a viable alternative to $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Stability is confirmed via scalar perturbation analysis of Hubble and matter density fluctuations, positioning $f(T, T_{\\mathcal{G}})$ gravity as a robust framework to address cosmic acceleration challenges. The model yields a present-day effective equation of state $\\omega_{\\mathrm{eff}}(z=0) \\approx -0.664$ to \\(-0.693\\), consistent with observations, and partially alleviates the Hubble tension with $H_0$ estimates of 69 to 71.5\\kms.

We study the propagation of a scalar wave, governed by the Klein-Gordon equation in curved spacetime, to focus on effects on amplitude and phase, while leaving aside the issue of wave polarization which affects electromagnetic and gravitational waves. Using the Newman-Penrose formalism, we obtain the first corrections beyond the geometric optics in the expansion in the inverse frequency. In vacuum, that is for Weyl tensor lensing, there is no wave effect at first order in $G$ and wave effects start at order $G^2$. Conversely, if the wave travels through a non-vanishing matter density, the first corrections start at order $G$. We check these analytic results by solving numerically the equations dictating the evolution of the corrections either in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole or through a transparent star.",

We analyze the effective potential that governs photon trajectories, explore the properties and location of the photon sphere (PS), and examine the effective radial force acting on photons. The resulting BH shadow is also studied, highlighting the roles of both the CoS parameter $\\alpha$ and the KR field parameter $\\ell$ in shaping its geometry. We constrain these parameters using observational data from M87* and Sgr A* obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the motion of neutral test particles in the same gravitational background. By examining the impact of the CoS and KR field, we show how these additional fields modify the dynamics relative to standard charged BH scenarios. Finally, we study the fundamental frequencies associated with quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) of test particles, demonstrating how these frequencies are affected by the presence of the CoS and KR field. Our results reveal the rich structure of AdS-BH spacetimes influenced by string clouds and antisymmetric tensor fields, with potential observational consequences in gravitational wave and BH imaging astronomy.",

In order to reflect the probability of quantum system in the quantum version of weak equivalence principle, we proposed a quantum weak equivalence principle based on differential scattering cross section at tree level, that is, the differential scattering cross section does not depend on the mass and properties of the scattered particles when the target particles take the large mass limit. This version of the quantum equivalence principle we proposed will be broken by the spin properties of quantum matter. In the non-relativistic case, the difference of differential scattering cross sections of scattered particles with different spin properties scattered by target particles is mainly reflected in the order of $ \\mathcal O (p _ {\\mathrm{cm}} ^2) $. In the relativistic case , we studied the asymptotic behavior of differential scattering cross sections at small angles. When the target particles are scalar particles, the difference of light particles with different spin properties is mainly reflected in the $ \\mathcal O (1/\\theta^2) $ order. When the target particles are Dirac particles, the difference of light particles with different spin properties is mainly reflected in the $ \\mathcal O (1/\\theta^4) $ order.

This background is anticipated to exhibit non-Gaussian statistical properties. To develop a robust method for detecting such a non-Gaussian gravitational-wave background, we revisit optimal detection strategies based on the Gaussian-mixture likelihood model. In this work, we demonstrate that properly accounting for the detector antenna pattern is essential. Current approaches typically rely on the overlap reduction function averaged over the sky. Through simulations, we show that using such an averaged response introduces significant biases in parameter estimation. In addition, we propose a computationally feasible method that incorporates second-order corrections as an approximation of the full integral over the source distribution. Our results indicate that this approach effectively eliminates these biases. We also show that our method remains robust even when considering anisotropic backgrounds.",

Furthermore, we compare the theoretical predictions of the charged SV-AdS black hole with recent observations reported by the Event Horizon telescope (EHT) for M87* and Sgr~A*. Beyond the geodesic analysis, we explore the thermodynamics of the regularized charged SV-AdS black hole by deriving essential quantities such as the Hawking temperature, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity. Through a systematic examination of these thermodynamic variables, we demonstrate how the regularization parameter inherent in the SV regularization influences particle dynamics, stability conditions, and the overall thermal properties of the modified black hole solution. This comprehensive study highlights the interplay between regularization effects and the physical observables associated with charged AdS black holes.",

The degree of differential rotation and the rotation profiles strongly influence their structure, stability and oscillation spectrum, and must therefore be taken into account when modeling their dynamics. We extend the pseudospectral code ROXAS (Relativistic Oscillations of non-aXisymmetric neutron stArS) to enable the dynamical evolution of oscillating, differentially rotating neutron stars. Using the updated code, we aim to study the star's oscillation frequencies. We extend the previous formalism, based on primitive variables and the conformal flatness approximation, to differential rotation. Within this framework, we run a series of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric simulations of perturbed, differentially rotating neutron stars with different rotation rates, and extract their oscillation frequencies. Axisymmetric modes, as well as those under the Cowling approximation, show excellent agreement with published results. We show that the secondary fundamental mode in the Cowling approximation is an artifact that does not appear in dynamical spacetimes. In addition, we provide, for the first time, frequency values for non-axisymmetric modes in differentially rotating configurations evolved in conformal flatness. This extension broadens the range of physical scenarios that can be studied with ROXAS, and represents a step toward more realistic modeling of post-merger remnants and their gravitational-wave emission.",

The amplification arises from a monopole induced reduction of the centrifugal barrier. This shift deepens the gravitational bound-state potential well and produces a parametrically larger instability growth rate. This resulting rapid growth yields a macroscopic boson cloud that acts as a coherent source of near monochromatic continuous gravitational waves (GWs). We find an enhanced GW power. Monopole harmonic selection rules restrict the emission from the north (south) clouds corresponding to opposite helicities. Their superposition generates an (approximately) circularly polarized continuous GWs at a fixed sky location within even parity general relativity, distinct from the generic elliptical polarization of the Kerr case. In light of these new findings, we propose a potential smoking-gun search strategy for magnetic monopole and ultralight boson: the rapid post-merger follow-up GW signals from binary-black-hole merger remnants through ground-based and space-based GW experiments. In contrast to the Kerr case, where the signal turn-on can be delayed to decades-centuries, a magnetic remnant can form a cloud and emit a stronger, circularly polarized continuous GWs within weeks to months. Taking the magnetic supermassive remnants as an example, we demonstrate that the rapid follow-up GW signal in the mHz band appears just in few weeks after binary black hole mergers. Moreover, future polarization (ellipticity) measurements can distinguish the magnetic scenario from Kerr while providing a parity-even mechanism for circularly polarized GWs in general relativity.",

Our results show that the model successfully describes the observed late-time cosmic acceleration with slightly tighter constraints from the inclusion of DESI dataset. The present-day Hubble constant is determined as $H_0 \\simeq 69.5\\ \\mathrm{km\\ s^{-1}\\ Mpc^{-1}}$, while the deceleration parameter confirms accelerated expansion with $q_0 \\simeq -0.57$.

Similarly, a smooth and physically consistent transition from a matter-dominated decelerated period at high redshifts to an accelerated phase at late times is revealed by the evolution of $\\omega_{eff}(z)$. While statefinder diagnostic shows the model favours a Chaplygin gas like nature for DESI and DESI+CC, whereas the model favours as quintessence dominated evolution for P-BAO+CC in the late time regime.

The new version includes a comparison between numerical relativity and our metric approximation in the case of circumbinary disk accretion General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We present a semi-analytic binary black hole (BBH) metric approximation that models the entire evolution of the system from inspiral to merger. The metric is constructed as a boosted Kerr-Schild superposition following post-Newtonian (PN) trajectories at the fourth PN order in the inspiral phase. During merger, we interpolate the binary metric in time to a single black hole remnant with properties obtained from numerical relativity {(NR)} fitting formulas. The new metric can model binary black holes with arbitrary spin direction, mass ratio, and eccentricity at any stage of their evolution in a fast and computationally efficient way. We analyze the properties of our new metric and compare it with a full numerical relativity evolution. We show that Hamiltonian constraints are well-behaved even at merger and that the mass and spin measured self-consistently on the black hole horizon deviate in average only $\\sim 10-5 \\%$ compared to the full numerical evolution. We perform General Relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulations for two cases: merging black holes in a uniform gas, and inspiralling black holes accreting from a magnetized circumbinary disk. We demonstrate that, in both cases, the properties of the gas, such as the accretion rate, are remarkably similar between the two approaches, with small average differences. We show that the approximate metric has several computational advantages over numerical relativity evolution. The numerical implementation of the metric is now open-source and optimized for numerical work.",

More precisely, we show that there exists a teleologically defined, codimension-one \"submanifold\" $\\mathfrak M_\\mathrm{stab}$ of the moduli space of spherically symmetric characteristic data for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field system lying close to the extremal Reissner-Nordström family, such that any data in $\\mathfrak M_\\mathrm{stab}$ evolve into a solution with the following properties as time goes to infinity: (i) the metric decays to a member of the extremal Reissner-Nordström family uniformly up to the event horizon, (ii) the scalar field decays to zero pointwise and in an appropriate energy norm, (iii) the first translation-invariant ingoing null derivative of the scalar field is approximately constant on the event horizon $\\mathcal H^+$, (iv) for \"generic\" data, the second translation-invariant ingoing null derivative of the scalar field grows linearly along the event horizon. Due to the coupling of the scalar field to the geometry via the Einstein equations, suitable components of the Ricci tensor exhibit non-decay and growth phenomena along the event horizon. Points (i) and (ii) above reflect the \"stability\" of the extremal Reissner-Nordström family and points (iii) and (iv) verify the presence of the celebrated \"Aretakis instability\" for the linear wave equation on extremal Reissner-Nordström black holes in the full nonlinear Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field model.",

By considering a direct coupling between spin-2 ULDM and ordinary matter, we derive the corresponding response functions and sensitivity curves for various time-delay interferometry channels and calculate the optimal sensitivity curves for future millihertz GW detectors. Our results demonstrate that the space-based detectors can place stringent constraints on the coupling constant of spin-2 ULDM, reaching $\\alpha \\sim 10^{-10}$ around a mass of $m \\sim 10^{-17} \\rm eV$, surpassing current limits from ground-based detectors and pulsar timing arrays.

The same composition law expresses the full entropy of the Reissner-Nordström black hole via the entropies of its outer and inner horizons. He we apply this composition law to the entropy of the Kerr black hole. As distinct from Reissner-Nordström black hole, where the full entropy depends only on mass $M$ and does not depend on its charge $Q$, the entropy of Kerr black hole is the sum of contributions from its mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$, i.e. $S(M,J)=S(M,0) + 4\\pi \\sqrt{J(J+1)}$. Here $S(M,0)$ is the entropy of the Schwarzschild black hole. This demonstrates that when the Kerr black hole with $J\\gg 1$ absorbs or emits a massless particle with spin $s_z=\\pm 1/2$, its entropy changes by $|\\Delta S| = 2\\pi$.

We further present intriguing geometries in which a finite future singularity appears in our universe but not in another universe connected by the wormhole. Near the throat, the hypersurface becomes timelike, allowing trajectories to traverse to the other universe before the singularity and return afterwards. We also construct wormhole solutions motivated by galactic dark-matter halo profiles, where the required non-vanishing pressure arises naturally from the four-scalar non-linear $\\sigma$ model.",

Version accepted for publication in Physical Review D General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Polymer models are effective in describing quantum gravity effects around the initial singularity, leading to its replacement by bouncing surfaces on which the curvature and densities are finite. Their properties depend on the space-time symmetry and on the particular polymerisation scheme adopted. In this article we investigate anisotropic models under the Gambini-Benítez-Pullin polymerisation, recently used to quantise spherically symmetric black-holes, whose interiors are isometric to Kantowski-Sachs (KS) space-times. Demanding that the minimum area defined by the bouncing surface matches the Loop Quantum Gravity area gap, we can find its radius alongside the curvature and effective density and pressures at the bounce. The density is always positive, while the pressures are negative enough to avoid the singularity. Due to the positive spatial curvature, the solution is oscillatory, reaching a maximum radius where a re-collapse occurs. Therefore, a positive cosmological constant is included in order to have an eternal expansion to a late de Sitter phase. We have also considered a Bianchi III metric, showing that the bounce is still present, but the space-time is asymptotically flat in this case, with no re-collapse. In this hyperbolic space, the minimal area constraint can also be imposed on compact $2$-surfaces. Nevertheless, in contrast to the KS case, it is enough for avoiding the singularity, independently of polymerisation procedures.",

Most existing studies, however, are restricted to unbound orbits. The finite-distance deflection angle, which assumes both the source and observer to be located at finite distances, motivates us to investigate the bending of bound orbits. In this work, we broaden the GW method to bound orbits of massive particles in stationary axisymmetric (SAS) spacetimes, following our previous extension in static spherically symmetric (SSS) backgrounds [Huang et al., Phys. Rev. D 107, 104046 (2023)]. By employing our generalized GW method for SAS spacetimes [Huang et al., J. Cosmol. Astropart. Phys. 01(2024)013], (a) We obtain a formula for the deflection angle of bound massive particles in SAS spacetimes by dividing bound orbits that azimuthally overlap with themselves into multiple non-overlapping segments. This division enables the application of the GW method -- originally developed for unbound orbits -- to each segment in a consistent manner. (b) We overcome the limitation associated with the loss of positive definiteness of the Jacobi-Maupertuis Randers-Finsler (JMRF) metric, which occurs because bound massive particles have energies below unity. To show the practical implementation of our approach, we carry out the calculation in Kerr spacetime and obtain the deflection angle between two arbitrary points along the bound orbit of massive particles.",

We consider two spherically-symmetric static mini-superspace models with matter fields and verify the robustness of this emergent symmetry at the classical level: (i) Maxwell field with cosmological constant and (ii) $n$ massless scalar fields. We develop a method based on canonical transformations and show that: for model (i), 3D Schrödinger symmetry emerges, and the solution is the (anti-) de Sitter Reissner-Nordström spacetime, and for model (ii), $(2+n)$D Schrödinger symmetry appears, and the solution is a generalized Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime and its ``interior\", a Kantowski-Sachs type closed universe. In the matter decoupling limit, both cases lead to 2D Schrödinger symmetry in different lapse functions and mini-superspace coordinates, which implies the covariance of Schrödinger symmetry. Finally, we propose a physical interpretation of the symmetry under Hamiltonian constraints $H$ and explain it with examples: Symmetry generators commuting with $H$ map a solution to another one, while those non-commuting with $H$ generate a new theory with the Schrödinger symmetry and the transformed configuration is a solution to the new theory. These support the robustness of the emergence of Schrödinger symmetry and open new possibilities for exploring quantum dynamics of matter and gravity based on the symmetry.",

In this paper, we explore motions of spinning particles orbiting a Reissner-Nordström black hole and examine whether this bound is violated in the spinor field of this black hole. For the neutral particle, when its spin magnitude surpasses a specific threshold, the value of the exponent exceeds the surface gravity, resulting in a violation of the bound. Given a fixed total angular momentum of the particle, when its spin direction is anti-aligned with the angular momentum direction, the exponent value is greater than that when the two directions are aligned. For the charged particle, taking into account the influence of the electromagnetic force, we find that for relatively large angular momenta, although the electromagnetic force does not change the trend of the exponent's variation with respect to spin and angular momentum, and only modifies its values, it still leads to the violation. Therefore, the chaos bound violations are observed in the spinor field.",

By analyzing photon trajectories in this background spacetime, we show how the model parameters affect light propagation, leading to wider ranges of lensed trajectories and photon rings. We identify regions of parameter space that admit physically consistent black hole shadows, characterized by the existence of a photon sphere located outside the event horizon and a shadow formed beyond it. These viable regions expand with increasing electric charge and increasing fR0, illustrating the interplay between gravitational and electromagnetic effects. By constraining the model using Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87*, we find that de Sitter black hole solutions remain compatible with the observational data, whereas anti-de Sitter solutions are disfavored for low electric charge and fR0 > -1. Finally, an analysis of the energy emission rate shows that higher electric charge enhances black hole evaporation, while stronger nonlinear electrodynamics effects and larger values of fR0 suppress it.",

These problems are usually `fixed' by postulating the existence of a scalar field (called the ``inflaton''). However, other less ad hoc options are possible. In the running vacuum model (RVM) framework, the vacuum energy density (VED) is a function of the Hubble rate $H$ and its time derivatives: $\\rho_{\\rm vac}=\\rho_{\\rm vac}(H, \\dot{H},\\ddot{H},\\dots)$. In this context, the VED is dynamical (there is no rigid cosmological constant $\\Lambda$). In the FLRW epoch, $\\rho_{\\rm vac}$ evolves very slowly with expansion, as befits the observed $\\Lambda\\simeq$const. behavior. In contrast, in the very early universe the vacuum fluctuations induce higher powers $H^N$ capable of unleashing fast inflation in a short period in which $H\\simeq$ const. We call this mechanism `RVM-inflation'. It does not require an inflaton field since inflation is brought about by pure quantum field theory (QFT) effects on the dynamical background. It is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant. In this work, we study a closely related scenario: the decay of the exact de Sitter vacuum into FLRW spacetime in its radiation epoch and the subsequent impact on the current universe, and compare with the RVM. We find that in both cases inflation is driven by $H^4$ powers together with subleading contributions of order $H^2$ that ease a graceful-exit transition into the radiation-dominated epoch, where the FLRW regime starts and ultimately develops a mildly evolving VED in the late universe: $\\delta\\rho_{\\rm vac}\\sim {\\cal O}(m_{\\rm Pl} ^2 H^2)$. The net outcome is an unified QFT approach to inflation and dark energy (conceived as dynamical vacuum energy) with potentially measurable phenomenological consequences in the present universe which can help cure the cosmological tensions.",

However, the disturbance from the Earth's low-degree gravity field makes it challenging for low Earth orbit gravity measurement satellites such as Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and TianQin-2 to extract signals from Earth's free oscillations directly. Here, we propose that by taking advantage of the high Earth orbit, the TianQin satellites can effectively avoid this disturbance, enabling direct measurement of Earth's free oscillations. We derive an analytical waveform to describe the response of Earth's free oscillations in TianQin. Based on this waveform, we use Bayesian analysis to extract the normal modes from numerical simulation data and perform parameter estimation. Our findings reveal that for a magnitude 7.9, Wenchuan-like earthquake, the resulting free oscillations will generate a signal that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 73 in TianQin, and approximately 9 different modes can be distinguished. This result shows TianQin can open a new window to examine the Earth's free oscillations and study the Earth's interior and earthquakes independently from ground-based gravity measurement.",

      "abstract": "When spacetime vibrates: An introduction to gravitational waves José P. S. Lemos Invited contribution to the special edition of the Portuguese Physical Society's Gazeta de Física dedicated to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the first detection of gravitational waves. 42 pages, 18 figures General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the physics of gravitational waves, exploring both the theoretical foundations and the most recent experimental advances. After a general introduction to the theory of general relativity and its major implications, the article discusses the history of gravitational waves, from their prediction by Einstein to their actual detection. It then explains what gravitational waves are and how they interact with appropriate detectors. The main mechanisms of gravitational radiation emission are analyzed, with a focus on compact binary systems of compact objects, whose orbits typically evolve in three phases: inspiral, merger, and the final ringdown phase, each of these phases leaving distinct signatures in the emitted waves. The article highlights the fundamental role of the giant interferometers LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, true cathedrals of modern science, and revisits the historic event GW150914, the first direct detection of gravitational waves, which confirmed the predictions of general relativity and opened a new era for astronomy. This achievement was recognized with the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Other observed events are also discussed, along with their astrophysical sources, and the possibility of detecting gravitational waves of cosmological origin, originating from the Big Bang itself. Finally, current and future projects are analyzed, including observatories based on increasingly sophisticated interferometers, as well as proposals for alternative detection methods, illustrating how gravitational-wave astronomy is shaping the present and future of our exploration of the universe. In concluding, the detection of gravitational waves is set in a broader context by examining the discoveries across the electromagnetic spectrum, thereby illustrating the complementary perspectives these different observational channels provide.",
