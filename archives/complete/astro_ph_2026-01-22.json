Boiza 15 pages, 5 figures, RevTex 4-2 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Generalised axion-like scalar fields provide a well-motivated framework for describing the late-time acceleration of the Universe. As the field evolves, it rolls down its potential and, depending on its mass and initial conditions, it may either still be approaching the minimum or already oscillating around it. These two dynamical regimes require distinct treatments of cosmological perturbations. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of linear cosmological perturbations in the regime where the dark-energy scalar field undergoes coherent oscillations about the minimum of its potential. We show that the standard effective fluid description breaks down in this phase and develop a consistent field-based perturbation framework, which we use to assess the impact of oscillatory dark energy on the growth of cosmic structures.",

      "abstract": "Template-free search for gravitational wave events using coincident anomaly detection Daniel Ratner Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Gravitational-wave (GW) observatories have used template-based search to detect hundreds of compact binary coalescences (CBCs). However, template-based search cannot detect astrophysical sources that lack accurate waveform models, including core-collapse supernovae, neutron star glitches, and cosmic strings. Here, we present a novel approach for template-free search using coincident anomaly detection (CoAD). CoAD requires neither labeled training examples nor background-only training sets, instead exploiting the coincidence of events across spatially separated detectors as the training loss itself: two neural networks independently analyze data from each detector and are trained to maximize coincident predictions. Additionally, we show that integrated gradient analysis can localize GW signals from the neural-network weights, providing a path toward data-driven template construction of unmodeled sources, and further improving precision by frequency matching. Using the CodaBench dataset of real LIGO backgrounds with injected simulated CBCs and sine-Gaussian low-frequency bursts, CoAD achieves recall up to 0.91 and 0.85 respectively at a false-alarm rate of one event per year, and achieves recall above 0.5 at signal-to-noise ratios below 10. The fully-unsupervised nature of CoAD makes it especially well-suited for next-generation detectors with greater sensitivity and associated increases in GW event rates.",

In the proposed design, all seismic isolation systems are housed in raise-bore wells drilled upward from the main tunnel toward an upper service tunnel. The pre-isolators for the most sensitive optics are located in the service tunnel, seating directly on strong and compact rock, while the other filters are distributed along the wells within compact, side-access vacuum chambers. Shorter, separate wells accommodate the seismic isolation systems for less demanding optics. This configuration provides substantial advantages: easier lock acquisition and improved robustness of the interferometers, lower-frequency pendulum stages, reduced congestion around the test masses, simplified installation and maintenance, improved vacuum partitioning, strong physical decoupling between the high- and low-frequency interferometers, and enhanced compatibility with future advances of Newtonian-noise cancellation. A novel technique for real-time, precision monitoring of rock motion and tilt provides a new signal for Newtonian noise cancellation and enables correction of seismic disturbances even during earthquakes, offering unique geophysical measurement capabilities.",

Such phenomena induce a nonvanishing cross-correlation between the $E$- and $B$-mode polarizations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), thereby providing a direct observational signature of parity violation. The Chern-Simons coupling between the scalar field in early dark energy (EDE) models and CMB photons is regarded as a plausible mechanism for generating cosmic birefringence. Recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) deliver $EB$ measurements at higher multipole moments than those previously achieved by {Planck}, while DESI and PantheonPlus datasets provide new and stringent constraints on the late-time expansion history. Using a joint analysis of {Planck}, DESI DR1, Pantheon+, and ACT data, we perform a full-parameter constraint on the cosmic birefringence effects induced by the EDE-CMB photon coupling. Our results favor a higher Hubble constant, $H_0 = 76.9^{+2.9}_{-2.5}\\,\\rm km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}$, and a relatively large EDE fraction, $f_{\\mathrm{EDE}} = 0.232^{+0.074}_{-0.047}$.

While this shift is typically negligible in most astrophysical contexts, strategies for its detection have been proposed for both electromagnetic and gravitational waves. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical treatment of the effect, deriving general expressions for the frequency shift within a lensing system embedded in a cosmological spacetime. Our formulation remains valid for arbitrary distances and velocities - including highly relativistic regimes - under any Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric. Expanding upon previous papers on moving lenses, we provide a detailed analysis of frequency effects induced by lenses moving at relativistic speeds. Furthermore, we extend standard lensing theory by deriving an exact formula for the variation in the source's viewing direction. This result is of interest for strongly anisotropic emitters, such as compact binary systems emitting gravitational waves. Finally, we quantify the apparent misalignment between the lens and the source's two images produced by time-delay effects in lens systems moving with high velocity.",

Mustafa, Farruh Atamurotov High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate accretion disk dynamics and the formation of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the infrared limit around Kerr-like black holes in asymptotically safe gravity. Relativistic hydrodynamic solutions of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion reveal that quantum corrections significantly modify the structure of the shock cone formed around the black hole. The black hole spin controls the asymmetric of the shock cone through frame-dragging effects, whereas the quantum correction parameter softens the effective gravitational potential, resulting in a wider shock opening angle, weaker post-shock compression, and reduced density concentration within the cone. Time-dependent mass accretion rates reveal oscillation modes trapped within the shock cone. The power spectral density (PSD) investigations suggest that these modes naturally generate low-frequency QPOs, whose amplitudes, coherence, and harmonic structure depend on both the spin and the quantum correction parameter. The PSD analyses performed at different radial locations reveal that identical QPO frequencies are obtained in all cases. The numerically detected frequencies result from the excitation of global oscillation modes trapped within the post-shock region. The resulting global modes are found to consist of fundamental frequencies, their associated harmonic overtones, and near-commensurate frequency ratios such as 2:1 and 3:2. Coherent oscillations are enhanced and near-commensurate frequency ratios are produced when moderate rotation and moderate quantum corrections are coupled. Large quantum correction parameters, on the other hand, wash out unique spectral peaks and suppress oscillation amplitudes.",

Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We reconsider back-reaction from large amplitude, short-scale perturbations onto a long wavelength adiabatic mode. In a loop expansion of the long-mode power spectrum, this back-reaction appears first at 1-loop. Due to the separation between the long and short scales, the separate universe method provides a simple and efficient framework for this computation. In this paper, building on our earlier work, we employ a $\\delta N$ formula for the long mode, which captures the effect of short scales. We show that back-reaction at 1-loop is due to either (i) non-linearity of the $\\delta N$ formula, or (ii) 1-loop corrections to the initial conditions. We argue that contributions of type (ii) cannot themselves be described within the separate universe framework, but their properties can be constrained using soft theorems and a ''multi-point propagator'' expansion. When applied to a band of enhanced short-scale perturbations that crossed the horizon during inflation, our result shows that the loop correction decouples from their detailed properties. Furthermore, the back-reaction we obtain is scale-invariant. Its magnitude is model-dependent, but is degenerate with effects from modes that were still sub-horizon at the end of inflation. In this scenario (but not necessarily in all scenarios), we conclude that the effect is not observable.",

This review examines how NSs can accumulate DM over time, potentially altering their fundamental properties. We explore leading models describing DM behavior within NSs, focusing on the effects of both bosonic and fermionic candidates on key features such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Additionally, we review how DM can modify the cooling and heating processes, trigger the formation of a black hole, and impact Gravitational Waves (GWs) emissions from binary systems.

In this work, we present the first full-sky computation of the angular bispectrum in second-order perturbation theory without invoking the Limber approximation, and formulated for finite redshift bins via window functions. To our knowledge, even the Newtonian part within this setup is novel. Building on this, we also include, up to second order in perturbation theory, the dynamical general relativistic and radiation effects, together with the leading relativistic projection effects. For simplicity, we neglect tracer bias and line-of-sight integrated contributions, however note that in particular the former can be straightforwardly incorporated within our framework. We evaluate the bispectrum contributions for two redshift bins, $1.75 \\leq z \\leq 2.25$ and $0.55 \\leq z \\leq 0.65$, and compare our theoretical prediction against relativistic light-cone simulations, with line-of-sight integral effects removed so as to enable direct consistency checks. As expected, we find that the Newtonian contributions are typically one or more orders of magnitudes larger than the relativistic signal across the entire spectrum for both redshifts. At $z=2$, we find that projection and dynamical relativistic effects have comparable amplitudes on large scales; somewhat unexpectedly, however, radiation effects dominate the relativistic signal in the squeezed limit. At $z=0.6$, the expected hierarchy is recovered, though dynamical corrections remain non-negligible -- only a factor of 2-3 smaller than projection effects. Our theoretical results agree fairly well with simulation measurements for the total bispectrum. To facilitate future applications and reproducibility, we make the corresponding code publicly available.",

Code release: this https URL . v2 reflects published article in PRD High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) All gravitational-wave signals are inevitably gravitationally lensed by intervening matter as they propagate through the Universe. When a gravitational-wave signal is magnified, it \\emph{appears} to have originated from a closer, more massive system. Thus, high-mass outliers to the gravitational-wave source population are often proposed as natural candidates for strongly lensed events. However, when using a data-driven method for identifying population outliers, we find that high-mass outliers are not necessarily strongly lensed, nor will the majority of strongly-lensed signals appear as high-mass outliers. This is both because statistical fluctuations produce a larger effect on observed binary parameters than does lensing magnification, and because lensing-induced outliers must originate from intrinsically high-mass sources, which are rare. Thus, the appearance of a single lensing-induced outlier implies the existence of many other lensed events within the catalog. We additionally show that it is possible to constrain the strong lensing optical depth, which is a fundamental quantity of our Universe, with the detection or absence of high-mass outliers. However, constraints using the latest gravitational-wave catalog are weak$\\unicode{x2014}$we obtain an upper limit on the optical depth of sources at redshift $1$ magnified by a factor of $5$ or more of $\\tau(\\mu\\geq5,z=1)\\leq 0.035 \\unicode{x2014}$and future observing runs will not make an outlier-based method competitive with other probes of the optical depth.

Version accepted for publication in PRD Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements play a key role in ruling out post-recombination solutions to the Hubble tension. However, because the data compression leading to these measurements assumes a fiducial $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, their reliability in testing late-time modifications to $\\Lambda$CDM has at times been called into question. We play devil's advocate and posit that fiducial cosmology assumptions do indeed affect BAO measurements in such a way that low-redshift acoustic angular scales (proportional to the Hubble constant $H_0$) are biased low, and test whether such a rescaling can rescue post-recombination solutions. The answer is no. Firstly, strong constraints on the shape of the $z \\lesssim 2$ expansion history from unanchored Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) prevent large deviations from $\\Lambda$CDM. In addition, unless $\\Omega_m$ is significantly lower than $0.3$, the rescaled BAO measurements would be in strong tension with geometrical information from the Cosmic Microwave Background. We demonstrate this explicitly on several dark energy (DE) models ($w$CDM, CPL DE, phenomenologically emergent DE, holographic DE, $\\Lambda_s$CDM, and the negative cosmological constant model), finding that none can address the Hubble tension once unanchored SNeIa are included. We argue that the $\\Lambda_s$CDM sign-switching cosmological constant model possesses interesting features which make it the least unpromising one among those tested. Our results demonstrate that possible fiducial cosmology-induced BAO biases cannot be invoked as loopholes to the Hubble tension \"no-go theorem\", and highlight the extremely important but so far underappreciated role of unanchored SNeIa in ruling out post-recombination solutions.",

In the present study, we investigated the possible existence of a universal relation between the binding energy of compact stars and the frequency of their non-radial oscillations. The main motivation was related to the fact that both of the aforementioned quantities might be measured in the occurrence of a supernova explosion. Interestingly, we found that there is a empirical relation between the oscillation frequency and the binding energy for both $f$ and $p_1$ modes, assuming hadronic stellar matter. The inclusion of hybrid equations of state, incorporating sharp phase transitions, was shown to result into deviations from the aforementioned quasi-universal relation.",

However, these methods are limited by observational uncertainties arising from multiple unknown and periodic physical effects, which substantially complicate subsequent data analysis. To mitigate these issues and improve data fidelity, we propose the Artificial Pulsar Polarization Arrays (APPA): a satellite network comprising multiple pulsed signal transmitters and a dedicated receiver satellite. To constrain the axion-photon coupling parameter $g_{a\\gamma}$, we generate simulated observations using Monte Carlo methods and investigate the sensitivity of APPA using two complementary approaches: Likelihood analysis and frequentist analysis. Simulations indicate that for the axion mass range of $10^{-22}-10^{-18}$ eV, APPA yields a tighter upper limit on $g_{a\\gamma}$ (at the 95\\% confidence level) than conventional ground-based observations, while also achieving superior detection sensitivity. Moreover, a larger spatial distribution scale of the satellite network corresponds to a greater advantage in detecting axions with lighter masses.",

We begin by reviewing basic aspects of lattice field theory, including symplectic and non-symplectic evolution algorithms. We then introduce lattice implementations of non-canonical interactions, considering scalars with a non-minimal coupling to gravity, $\\phi^2R$, non-minimal scalar kinetic theories, $\\mathcal{G}_{ab}(\\lbrace\\phi_c\\rbrace)\\partial_\\mu\\phi^a\\partial^\\mu\\phi^b$, and axion-like particle (ALP) interactions with Abelian gauge fields, $\\phi F_{\\mu\\nu}\\tilde F^{\\mu\\nu}$. Next, we discuss methods to set up special field configurations, including the creation of cosmic defect networks towards scaling (e.g. cosmic strings and domain walls), field configurations based on arbitrary power spectra or spatial profiles, and probabilistic methods as required e.g. for thermal configurations. We further extend the notion of non-canonical theories, discussing the discretization of scalar field dynamics in $d + 1$ dimensions, with $d \\neq 3$. Unrelated to non-canonical aspects, we also discuss implementation(s) of gravitational wave (GW) dynamics on the lattice. This document represents the theoretical basis for the non-canonical field theory aspects (interactions, initial conditions, dimensionality) and GW dynamics implemented in ${\\mathcal C}$osmo${\\mathcal L}$attice v2.0, to be released in 2026.",

Submitted to JCAP Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Overdense regions can collapse into primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe, which are a compelling candidate for dark matter. Current constraints leave the asteroid-mass window the only possible one for PBH to account for all the dark matter, which can only be probed indirectly by the scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs) sourced by the curvature perturbation which forms PBH. In this work, we explore the capabilities of future space-based gravitational wave detectors, including LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, to constrain such induced GWs as well as the PBH abundance. We systematically account for the width of the primordial curvature power spectrum, and find that the asteroid-mass window can be fully probed by all three space-based interferometers. If PBHs constitute the majority of dark matter, the induced GW leaves a strong signal in the mHz band with a signal-to-noise ratio of $10^3$--$10^4$.",

We report a tabletop experiment that characterizes the interferometer's optical response near DC. When the laser frequency is locked to the resonance of the L-shaped cavity, we observe that the cavity input coupler becomes effectively transparent, yielding a simple Michelson-like response. Moreover, the Sagnac vortex separates into upper and lower paths, which behave as two independent pumping paths driving the cavity. These observations are in agreement with theoretical predictions. Our results provide an intuitive physical picture of this interferometer topology and offer insight into its lock acquisition strategy.",

Wechsler 21 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables; accepted by ApJ Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present a joint analysis of galaxy clustering and galaxy--galaxy lensing measurements from BOSS galaxies using a simulation-based emulation method combined with a halo occupation distribution model. Our emulators are constructed with the Aemulus $\\nu$ simulations, a suite of $w\\nu$CDM $N$-body simulations with massive neutrinos as independent particle species. We combine small-scale analysis of clustering from $0.1h^{-1}$Mpc to $60.2~h^{-1}$Mpc and lensing from $1.7h^{-1}$Mpc to $60.2~h^{-1}$Mpc to perform cosmological constraints. We split the BOSS galaxies into three redshift bins to measure their clustering and employ galaxies from Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey and Hyper Suprime-Cam as source galaxies to measure lensing separately. We find that the addition of lensing significantly improves the constraining power on $S_{8}=\\sigma_8(\\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}$, with a weak improvement for $f\\sigma_{8}$. Our results of $f\\sigma_{8}$ indicate tensions of around $1\\sim4\\sigma$ below the results of CMB observations of Planck. For $S_{8}$, our results are also lower than Planck, and the tension can be mitigated when considering possible systematics in lensing measurement. As a byproduct, our analysis prefers a non-zero neutrino mass but without strong significance, with the constraining power dominated by the clustering. Given the accuracy and precision of our model and the observational data, it is anticipated that larger and higher-quality spectroscopic datasets will improve the constraints on this fundamental property in the near future.",

We examine the signature of the transition as traced through the redshifted 21-cm line with SKA-Low at $3 < z < 7$. To do so, we use the semi-numerical simulation \\textsc{21cmFAST} to model the HI during the EoR and add a HI-halo based post-processing model of the late-time HI. This approach gives a robust estimate of the amplitude of the HI temperature field and predicts the observable power spectrum during the transition period. We find that our simulation pipeline reproduces the expected power spectrum trends from existing observations and theory, in addition to replicating current observational constraints on $\\Omega_{\\text{HI}}$. Our simulations predict a drop in power of four orders of magnitude between $4 < z < 7$. Assuming an inhomogeneous recombination model, we find a flattening of the power due to lingering neutral islands masking the late-time HI signal for $5 < z< 6.5$. Using SKA-Low deep survey parameters, we find HI power spectrum detectability at scales $k \\leq 1$ $h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for redshifts $3< z < 7$, even when using the horizon limit to mitigate foregrounds. Our results suggest a sufficient SNR of the HI power spectrum tracing the underlying halos $z < 5$, which can be used for late-time cosmology. Our results suggest that the resulting $\\Omega_{\\rm HI}$ constraints can trace different reionization scenarios such as a decreased escape fraction. This study implies that deep SKA-Low observations for $3< z< 7$ will be an important probe to constrain reionization parameters as well as cosmological models.",

Falsifying Classical Stochastic Inflation Veronica Sanz Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Inflationary cosmology successfully accounts for the observed properties of primordial fluctuations using quantum field theory in an expanding background. However, the quantum nature of these fluctuations has not been experimentally established, since classical stochastic models could reproduce the observed two-point statistics by construction. Existing approaches to testing primordial quantumness focus primarily on Bell inequalities, which provide a sharp conceptual criterion but are difficult to implement with cosmological observables. In this work we adopt a falsification-based approach. We define a precise classical hypothesis for the origin of primordial perturbations (local stochastic fields admitting a positive probability distribution) and identify inequality constraints that must be satisfied within this class. We show how violations of these classicality inequalities can be probed using realistic cosmological observables, without invoking Bell tests or non-commuting measurement settings. We further identify symmetry-protected spectator sectors in which quantum coherence is parametrically preserved during inflation, allowing violations of observable magnitude to survive decoherence. Our results show that large-scale structure and future 21 cm surveys provide a viable and quantitative route to falsifying classical stochastic descriptions of primordial fluctuations.",

      "abstract": "An efficient model of cosmology dependence in the covariance matrix of the matter power spectrum Theodore Steele, Robert Smith, Roisin O'Connor Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Covariance matrices are essential cosmological probes of fundamental physics, providing information on numerous fundamental physical parameters and varying with any change in the underlying cosmology. However, this cosmology dependence, while providing excellent information, also makes them computationally intensive to compute, as a new covariance matrix must explicitly be calculated for every variation in cosmology before comparisons to observational data can be made. In this paper, we develop an efficient model for estimating the parameter dependence of the covariance matrix of the matter power spectrum by Taylor expanding around a known value of the parameter space. This method allows us to use a relatively small number of input cosmologies, specifically one fiducial cosmology and two further cosmologies for each parameter. We explicitly calculate the covariance matrices for these cosmologies and then develop a new model that allows us to interpolate from these the form of the covariance matrix with a cosmology that is located elsewhere in that given parameter space without explicit perturbation theory calculations. This method speeds up covariance matrix calculations in new cosmologies by orders of magnitude compared to explicit perturbation theory calculations at each point in a given parameter space. Using different approximations, we develop three versions of our interpolated covariance matrix and validate the model by recreating all of our input cosmologies using all three forms, both with and without super-sample covariance corrections in each case, and show that the models provide robust recreations of the original results, with the different approximations being valid in certain regimes.",

Statistical cross-correlations between the UGRB and tracers of large-scale cosmic structure allow us to infer which sources contribute the most to this emission. In this work, we examine the angular correlation between the UGRB and the matter distribution traced by galaxies, using twelve years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations along with three years of Dark Energy Survey (DES) data. We detect a correlation with a signal-to-noise ratio of 7.96, primarily driven by large angular scales. We then perform a multi-tracer analysis that combines this measurement with the cross-correlation between $\\gamma$ rays and DES weak lensing. The two single-tracer results are mutually consistent, and their combination yields a total significance of 8.6, firmly establishing the extragalactic origin of the UGRB. Intriguingly, the properties inferred for the sources contributing to the UGRB show departures from those of the resolved {\\gamma}-ray population, suggesting that the faint end of the $\\gamma$-ray sky is not a simple extrapolation of currently resolved sources.",

Their origin is generally attributed to cluster mergers that generate turbulence and re-accelerate aged electrons. We study the diffuse radio emission, spectral properties, and the connection between thermal and non-thermal components in the massive galaxy clusters Abell 773 and Abell 1351 ($M_{500} \\sim 7 \\times 10^{14}\\,M_{\\odot}$), both of which are dynamically disturbed. We combine LOFAR LoTSS-DR2 observations at 144 MHz with uGMRT observations at 650 MHz, supplemented by archival XMM-Newton X-ray imaging. We confirm that both clusters host radio halos extending up to a largest linear size of $\\sim 2$ Mpc. We measure an integrated spectral index $\\alpha_{144}^{650} \\sim -1.0$ for both clusters. The radio halo in Abell 773 resembles a classical halo and follows a sublinear radio--X-ray surface brightness relation. In contrast, Abell 1351 shows a more complex and asymmetric morphology, influenced by embedded radio sources including the brightest cluster galaxy, a tailed radio galaxy, and a ridge-like feature. These contaminating sources lead to deviations from the sublinear trend in the point-to-point radio--X-ray analysis of Abell 1351.",

This work develops a mass inversion method tailored for upcoming space missions such as CSST and Euclid, aiming to recover both the mass distribution and the convergence power spectrum with high fidelity. We introduce MIU2Net, a versatile deep-learning framework for kappa-map reconstruction based on the U2-Net architecture. A new loss function is constructed to jointly estimate the convergence field and its frequency-domain energy distribution, effectively balancing optimal mean squared error and optimal power-spectrum recovery. The method incorporates realistic observational effects into shear fields, including shape noise, reduced shear, and complex masks. Under noise levels anticipated for future space-based lensing surveys, MIU2Net recovers the convergence power spectrum with 4% uncertainties up to l approximately 500, significantly outperforming Wiener filtering and MCALens. Beyond two-point statistics, the method accurately reconstructs the convergence distribution, peak centroid, and peak amplitude. Compared to other learning-based approaches such as DeepMass, MIU2Net reduces the root-mean-square error by 5% without smoothing and by 38% with a 1-arcmin smoothing scale.

Rose, Brian Schmidt, Mat Smith, Maria Vincenzi Submitted to MNRAS, comments welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Type Ia supernovae are a cornerstone of modern cosmology, providing first evidence for cosmic acceleration and new tests of dark energy. Son et al. 2025 (S25) claim a strong redshift evolution in standardized supernova luminosities driven by supernova progenitor age, with dramatic cosmological implications: rapidly evolving dark energy, decelerating expansion, and a $9\\sigma$ tension with $\\Lambda$CDM. We show that the underpinning evidence required for this conclusion -- the supernova progenitor-age dependence, the redshift-dependent age difference, and their combined impact -- is either negligible or relies on effects already corrected for in modern supernova analyses. First, the S25 analysis omits the standard host-galaxy stellar mass correction that captures known environmental dependencies that also correlate with stellar age. Applying this correction to the S25 sample, we find no dependence of standardized supernova brightness on host age. Independent data also show no significant difference at low-redshift in standardized brightness between star-forming galaxies and several Gyr older quiescent galaxies of the same stellar mass. Second, the S25 scenario predicts strong redshift evolution of the host-mass effect. Data from the Dark Energy Survey supernova survey measure evolution of $-0.028 \\pm 0.034~\\mathrm{mag}\\,z^{-1}$, consistent with zero and altering the dark-energy equation-of-state measurement ($w$) by $<$0.01 if included. Third, we demonstrate that the claimed $\\sim5$~Gyr progenitor age difference between nearby and distant supernovae is overstated by factors of three to five largely due to a conflation of host galaxy age with supernova progenitor age. We conclude that type~Ia supernova cosmology remains robust for current measurements of dark energy.",

Lett. B Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Doppler lensing, a relativistic effect resulting from the peculiar velocities of galaxies along the line of sight, provides insight into the large-scale structure of the Universe. Relativistic simulations are essential for modeling Doppler lensing because they incorporate gravity and motion in spacetime. We compare two relativistic $N$-body simulation frameworks, $\\texttt{GEVOLUTION}$ and $\\texttt{SCREENING}$, to calculate Doppler lensing convergence in cosmic voids of different sizes and halos of different masses. Our analysis reveals scale-dependent performance: $\\texttt{SCREENING}$ shows larger differences in small voids (radius range: 15--25 Mpc/h) with a mean absolute relative difference of 38.5\\%, due to linearized dynamics failing in nonlinear regimes. Medium voids (25--35 Mpc/h) show better agreement (9.5\\% mean difference). For large voids (35--45 Mpc/h), $\\texttt{SCREENING}$ exhibits intermediate differences (16.9\\% mean difference) with central instabilities. Moreover, our Doppler convergence analysis with massive halos ($10^{11.5}$--$10^{14} {~h^{-1}\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$) demonstrates excellent consistency (1.6--3.6\\% mean difference). These findings provide clear guidance for simulation choice: $\\texttt{GEVOLUTION}$ is recommended for precision studies critical to $\\Lambda$CDM or modified gravity tests, while $\\texttt{SCREENING}$ offers a computationally efficient alternative for relativistic treatments with large catalogs of voids and halos, assisting future astrophysical surveys.",

Employing the Local Variance Estimator (LVE) method, we systematically reexamine the properties of HPA to investigate possible frequency dependence as well as scale dependence in its amplitude and direction. We model the HPA as a scale-dependent dipole modulation following a power-law form, rather than assuming a scale-invariant case. Our analysis incorporates seven cleaned frequency-specific CMB temperature maps from both the Planck and WMAP missions to test the robustness of the observed asymmetry across instruments and frequency channels. We find that the dipolar modulation characteristic of HPA is present in all cases examined, with consistent estimates of the preferred direction and scale-dependent variation in dipole amplitudes. These results support the conclusion that the observed asymmetry is unlikely to arise from instrumental artifacts or data-processing effects, and instead points toward a persistent large-scale feature of the CMB sky with a possible cosmological origin.",

Escamilla, Giovanni Montani, Eleonora Di Valentino Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The persistent Hubble tension and the lack of a fundamental explanation for dark energy motivate the exploration of alternative mechanisms capable of reproducing late-time cosmic acceleration. In this work, we revisit gravitationally induced particle creation as a phenomenological non-equilibrium process that can effectively mimic a dynamical dark-energy component. Within the thermodynamic framework of open systems, we model the production of an unspecified particle species with constant intrinsic equation-of-state parameter and consider four phenomenological parametrisations of the particle-creation rate. The modified continuity and Friedmann equations lead to an effective negative pressure and a redshift-dependent effective equation of state, which we constrain using Cosmic Chronometers, Pantheon+ supernovae, DESI DR2 BAO, a compressed CMB likelihood, and SH0ES data. Using the full dataset combination, we find that particle-creation models provide fits comparable to $\\Lambda$CDM, yielding $H_0 \\simeq 69.3\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$ and present-day effective dark-energy equation-of-state values close to $w^{\\rm eff}_{\\rm DE}(0)\\simeq -1$, with all models predicting an accelerating Universe ($q_0\\simeq -0.55$). When the Hubble tension is assessed using early- and late-time dataset splits, particle-creation scenarios reduce its statistical significance to the $\\simeq 2.4\\sigma$--$3\\sigma$ level, compared to the $4.3\\sigma$ discrepancy obtained in $\\Lambda$CDM. Although deviations from $\\Lambda$CDM remain mild and Bayesian model comparison indicates no statistical preference between models, gravitationally induced particle creation emerges as a viable late-time extension of the standard cosmological model and provides a consistent phenomenological framework for exploring departures from $\\Lambda$CDM.",

Submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present a new free-form lens model for the $z=0.348$ galaxy cluster AS1063, based on previously spectroscopically confirmed lensed galaxies and new images from the GLIMPSE program. We use the ultra-deep data to identify new counterimages for previously confirmed (spectroscopically) lensed systems. We use the full set of spectroscopically confirmed systems to derive a new lens model, which is later used to confirm many of the previous lensed system candidates and discover new lensed system candidates in the images. We compute the geometric redshifts, time delays, and magnification for all counterimages (confirmed and not confirmed). Among the new systems we find a peculiar multiply lensed galaxy with a strong emission line at $\\approx 4\\, \\mu$m that likely corresponds to H$-\\beta$ and/or OIII at $z\\approx 7.5$. This galaxy could be a little-red-dot or an extreme emission line galaxy. We also identify a yellow supergiant lensed star candidate at $z\\approx 3.1$. This star shows some similarities with previous Kaiju stars and we nickname it \"Hedorah\", in honor of the famous yellow-eyed Kaiju. Previous lensed stars at $z>0.1$ are either blue supergiants or red supergiants, making Hedorah the first yellow supergiant discovered beyond $z=0.1$ and confirming that, despite their rarity, they can also be found at these redshifts. Since many Cepheid stars are yellow supergiants, we consider the possibility that Hedorah could also be the first Cepheid discovered at cosmological distances, but we conclude that Hedorah is more likely a hypergiant yellow star approaching the end of its life. Alternatively, Hedorah could be a small group of stars, although this is less likely based on Hedorah's peculiar colors and additionally may require the more exotic fuzzy dark matter to help explain the lack of counterimage.",

Pedrosa 23 pages, 19 figures, 2 tables, 1 appendix. Accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We study the local evolution of the Universe around galaxy formation sites in the EAGLE50 large-volume reference simulation. Using the reduced inertia tensor (r-TOI), we followed the anisotropic evolution of initially spherical Lagrangian volumes (LVs) centred at galaxy formation sites, both in dark matter (DM) and in cold baryons (CB), from very high redshift $z=15$ onward. We describe LV deformation in terms of the r-TOI eigen-directions, principal axes, their derived shape parameters, and the timescales for the freezing-out of these principal directions and axes. Of particular interest are the age of the Universe, $t_{\\rm U}$, when the local Cosmic Web (CW) spine emerges, and that when anisotropic DM mass arrangements (i.e., migrant mass flows) cease. We find that the shapes LVs acquire along their evolution affect the halo and stellar mass of their central galaxy: prolate-shaped LVs show a tendency to host low-mass galaxies at $z=0$, while massive galaxies tend to form within triaxial or oblate LVs. Also, the local CW spine tends to set in earlier on in LVs that are to host massive galaxies than in those harbouring less massive galaxies. In addition, anisotropic DM-mass rearrangements stop late on average, at $t_{\\rm U}\\sim 10.5\\,$Gyr, and even slightly later for CB. Interestingly, $z=0$ LVs with either flattened configurations in CB or those that are highly prolate in DM, are more likely to host rotation-dominated galaxies. This effect increases from $z=1$ to $z=0$. Finally, the CB spine of LVs that are more likely to host rotation-dominated galaxies emerges at later times.",

We compute the radial galaxy number density profile in the cluster, and observe no clear evidence of infalling groups or cosmic filaments. We observe a clear bimodal colour relation in member galaxies, with red fraction increasing towards the cluster centre. This rapid increase of red fraction upon infall is indicative of a fast quenching mechanism, such as ram pressure stripping, as galaxies enter the cluster centre.

Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will produce unprecedented volumes of heterogeneous astronomical data (images, catalogs, and alerts) that challenge traditional analysis pipelines. The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) aims to derive robust constraints on dark energy and dark matter from these data, requiring methods that are statistically powerful, scalable, and operationally reliable. Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) are already embedded across DESC science workflows, from photometric redshifts and transient classification to weak lensing inference and cosmological simulations. Yet their utility for precision cosmology hinges on trustworthy uncertainty quantification, robustness to covariate shift and model misspecification, and reproducible integration within scientific pipelines. This white paper surveys the current landscape of AI/ML across DESC's primary cosmological probes and cross-cutting analyses, revealing that the same core methodologies and fundamental challenges recur across disparate science cases. Since progress on these cross-cutting challenges would benefit multiple probes simultaneously, we identify key methodological research priorities, including Bayesian inference at scale, physics-informed methods, validation frameworks, and active learning for discovery. With an eye on emerging techniques, we also explore the potential of the latest foundation model methodologies and LLM-driven agentic AI systems to reshape DESC workflows, provided their deployment is coupled with rigorous evaluation and governance. Finally, we discuss critical software, computing, data infrastructure, and human capital requirements for the successful deployment of these new methodologies, and consider associated risks and opportunities for broader coordination with external actors.",

Lett. 123, 251301 (2019) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Line-intensity mapping (LIM) of emission from star-forming galaxies can be used to measure the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale as far back as the epoch of reionization. This provides a standard cosmic ruler to constrain the expansion rate of the Universe at redshifts which cannot be directly probed otherwise. In light of growing tension between measurements of the current expansion rate using the local distance ladder and those inferred from the cosmic microwave background, extending the constraints on the expansion history to bridge between the late and early Universe is of paramount importance. Using a newly derived methodology to robustly extract cosmological information from LIM, which minimizes the inherent degeneracy with unknown astrophysics, we show that present and future experiments can gradually improve the measurement precision of the expansion rate history, ultimately reaching percent-level constraints on the BAO scale. Specifically, we provide detailed forecasts for the SPHEREx satellite, which will target the H$\\alpha$ and Lyman-$\\alpha$ lines, and for the ground-based COMAP instrument -- as well as a future stage-3 experiment -- that will target the CO rotational lines. Besides weighing in on the so-called Hubble tension, reliable LIM cosmic rulers can enable wide-ranging tests of dark matter, dark energy and modified gravity.",

D 100, 123522 (2019) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Line-intensity mapping (LIM) provides a promising way to probe cosmology, reionization and galaxy evolution. However, its sensitivity to cosmology and astrophysics at the same time is also a nuisance. Here we develop a comprehensive framework for modelling the LIM power spectrum, which includes redshift space distortions and the Alcock-Paczynski effect. We then identify and isolate degeneracies with astrophysics so that they can be marginalized over. We study the gains of using the multipole expansion of the anisotropic power spectrum, providing an accurate analytic expression for their covariance, and find a 10%-60% increase in the precision of the baryon acoustic oscillation scale measurements when including the hexadecapole in the analysis. We discuss different observational strategies when targeting other cosmological parameters, such as the sum of neutrino masses or primordial non-Gaussianity, finding that fewer and wider bins are typically more optimal. Overall, our formalism facilitates an optimal extraction of cosmological constraints robust to astrophysics.",

Zapelli 26 pages, 22 figures, submitted to A&A Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We present an improved zodiacal light (ZL) model for COBE-DIRBE derived through global Bayesian analysis within the Cosmoglobe Data Release 2 framework. The parametric form of the ZL model is inspired by the original DIRBE model by Kelsall et al. (K98), but the specific best-fit parameter values are re-derived using the combination of DIRBE Calibrated Individual Observations, Planck HFI sky maps, and WISE and Gaia compact object catalogs. Furthermore, the ZL parameters are fitted jointly with astrophysical parameters, such as thermal dust and starlight emission, and the new model takes into account excess radiation that appears stationary in solar-centric coordinates as reported in a companion paper. The relative differences between the predicted signals from K98 and our new model are $\\lesssim 3\\%$ in the 12 and 25 $\\mu$m channels over the full sky. The zero-levels of the cleaned DR2 maps are lower than those of the K98 ZL Subtracted Mission Average maps by $\\sim 30$ kJy/sr at 1.25--3.5 $\\mu$m, which is larger than the entire predicted contribution from high-redshift galaxies to the Cosmic Infrared Background at the same wavelengths. At high Galactic latitudes, the total RMS of each DR2 map is lower than the corresponding DIRBE ZSMA map of $\\sim$ 80 \\% at wavelengths 4.9--25 $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Still, obvious ZL residuals can be seen in several of the DR2 maps, and further work is required to mitigate these. Joint analysis with high-resolution full-sky surveys such as AKARI, IRAS, Planck HFI, and SPHEREx will be essential both to break key degeneracies in the current model and to determine whether the reported solar-centric excess radiation has a ZL or instrumental origin. Thus, while the results presented in this paper do redefine the state-of-the-art for DIRBE modelling, it also only represents the first among many steps toward a future optimal Bayesian ZL model.

We use lattice techniques that explicitly preserve gauge invariance and shift symmetry, and which we validate against other computational methods of the linear dynamics and of the homogeneous backreaction regime. Notably, we demonstrate that the latter fails to accurately describe the truly local dynamics of strong backreaction. We investigate the convergence of simulations of local backreaction, determining the requirements to achieve an accurate description of the dynamics, and providing useful parametrizations of the delay of the end of inflation. Additionally, we identify key features emerging from a proper local treatment of strong backreaction: the dominance of magnetic energy against the electric counterpart, the excitation of the longitudinal mode, and the generation of a scale-dependent chiral (im)balance. Our results underscore the necessity to accurately capture the local nature of the non-linear dynamics of the system, in order to correctly assess phenomenological predictions, such as e.g. the production of gravitational waves and primordial black holes.",

The unknown properties of dark energy, the driver of this acceleration, have not only prompted extensive studies on its nature but also spurred interest in modified gravity theories that might serve as alternatives. In this paper, we adopt a bumblebee vector-tensor modified gravity theory to model the cosmic expansion history and derive predictions for the Hubble parameter. We constrain the bumblebee model parameters using observational data from established probes, including the Pantheon+ Type Ia Supernovae calibrated via the SH0ES (Supernova $H_0$ for the Equation of State) Cepheid distance ladder analysis and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2), as well as recently included cosmic chronometers (CC) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of the Bayesian posterior distribution enables us to rigorously constrain the bumblebee models and compare them with the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that the bumblebee theory on its own can provide sufficiently good fits to the current observational data of distance- and time-redshift relations, suggesting its potential to explain the cosmic background dynamics. However, when compared to $\\Lambda$CDM, the latter still outperforms the former according to the information criteria. We propose that further constraints from cosmological perturbation tests could impose more stringent constraints on bumblebee cosmology.",

Salazar, Eduardo Rozo Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Dark matter halos are typically defined as spheres that enclose some overdensity, but these sharp, somewhat arbitrary boundaries introduce non-physical artifacts such as backsplash halos, pseudo-evolution, and an incomplete accounting of halo mass. A more physically motivated alternative is to define halos as the collection of particles that are physically orbiting within their potential well. However, existing methods to classify particles as orbiting or infalling suffer from trade-offs between accuracy, computational cost, and generalizability across cosmologies. We present an efficient, yet accurate, supervised machine learning approach using decision trees. The classification is based on only the particle radii and velocities at two epochs. Compared to detailed analysis of particle trajectories, we find that our model matches the classification of 97\\% of particles. Consequently, we are able to quickly and accurately reproduce the density profiles of the orbiting and infalling components out to many virial radii. We demonstrate that our model generalizes to a significantly different cosmology that lies outside the training dataset. We make publicly available both our final model and the code to train similar models.",

There remains an unconstrained ``asteroid-mass'' window where PBHs of masses $10^{17} {\\rm g} \\lesssim M \\lesssim 10^{23} {\\rm g}$ could comprise up to $100\\%$ of the dark matter. Current $e^{\\pm}$ Hawking radiation constraints on the DM fraction of PBHs are set by comparing observed spatial- and time-integrated cosmic ray flux measurements with predicted Hawking emission fluxes from the galactic DM halo. These constraints depend on cosmic ray production and propagation models, the galactic DM density distribution, and the PBH mass function. We propose to mitigate these model dependencies by developing a new local, time-dependent Hawking radiation signature to detect low-mass PBHs transiting through the inner Solar System. We calculate transit rates for PBHs that form with initial masses $M \\lesssim 5\\times10^{17}\\text{g}$. We then simulate time-dependent positron signals from individual PBH flybys as measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) experiment in low-Earth orbit. We find that AMS is sensitive to PBHs with masses $M\\lesssim 2\\times10^{14} \\, {\\rm g}$ due to its lower energy threshold of $500 \\, {\\rm MeV}$. We demonstrate that a dataset of daily positron fluxes over the energy range $5-500 \\, {\\rm MeV}$, with similar levels of precision to the existing AMS data, would enable detection of PBHs drawn from present-day distributions that peak within the asteroid-mass window. Our simulations yield ${\\cal O} (1)$ detectable PBH transits per year across wide regions of parameter space, which may be used to constrain PBH mass functions. This technique could be extended to detect $\\gamma$-ray and X-ray Hawking emission to probe further into the asteroid-mass window.",

We employ high-resolution $N$-body simulations from the BACCO suite and apply a combination of cutting-edge techniques such as cosmology scaling and baryonification to efficiently span a large cosmological and astrophysical parameter space. A deep neural network is trained to emulate baryonic effects on the matter bispectrum measured in simulations, capturing modifications across various scales and redshifts relevant to Euclid. We validate the emulator accuracy and robustness using an analysis of \\Euclid mock data, employing predictions from the state-of-the-art FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations. The emulator reproduces baryonic suppression in the bispectrum to better than 2$\\%$ for the $68\\%$ percentile across most triangle configurations for $k \\in [0.01, 20]\\,\\mathrm{i}h\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and ensures consistency between cosmological posteriors inferred from second- and third-order weak lensing statistics. These results demonstrate that our emulator meets the high-precision requirements of the Euclid mission for at least the first data release and provides reliable forecasts of the cosmological information contained in the small-scale matter bispectrum. This underscores the potential of emulation techniques to bridge the gap between complex baryonic physics and observational data, maximising the scientific output of Euclid.",

      "abstract": "Cavendish experiment with fast radio bursts on cosmological scales Shuren Zhou, Pengjie Zhang Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) A key measure of gravity is the relation between the Weyl potential $\\Psi+\\Phi$ and the matter overdensity $\\delta_m$, encapsulated as an effective gravitational constant $G_{\\rm light}$ for light motion. Its value, along with possible spatial and temporal variations, is essential for probing physics beyond Einstein gravity. However, the absence of an unbiased proxy for $\\delta_m$ prevents the direct measurement of $G_{\\rm light}$. In this letter, we point out that the equivalence principle guarantees the dispersion measure (DM) of localized fast radio bursts (FRBs) as a good proxy for $\\delta_m$. We further propose an FRB-based estimator $F_G$ to directly measure $G_{\\rm light}$, combining galaxy-DM of localized FRBs and galaxy-weak lensing cross-correlations. With a conservative cut $k\\leq 0.1h$/Mpc, the measurement can achieve a precision of $\\lesssim 10\\% \\sqrt{10^5/N_{\\rm FRB}}$ over 10 equal-width redshift bins at $z\\lesssim 1$. The major systematic error, arising from the clustering bias of electrons traced by the FRB DM, remains subdominant at the $5\\%$ level. It can be further mitigated to the $\\lesssim 1\\%$ level, based on the gastrophysics-agnostic behavior that the clustering bias of total baryons (ionized diffuse gas, stars, neutral hydrogen, etc) approaches unity at sufficiently large scales. Therefore, FRBs shed light on gravitational physics across spatial and temporal scales spanning 20 orders of magnitude.",

Davis, David Camarena, Francis-Yan Cyr-Racine Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Neutrinos with Standard Model interactions free-stream in the early Universe, leaving a distinct phase shift in the pattern of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). When isolated, this phase shift allows one to robustly infer the presence of the cosmic neutrino background in BAO and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data independently of other cosmological parameters. While in the context of the Standard Model, this phase shift follows a known scale-dependent relation, new physics in the cosmic neutrino background could alter the overall shape of this feature. In this paper, we discuss how changes in the neutrino phase shift could be used to constrain self-interactions among neutrinos. We produce simple models for this phase-shift assuming universal self-interactions, and use these in order to understand what constraining power is available for the strength of such interactions in BAO and CMB data. We find that, although challenging, it may be possible to use a detection of the phase to put a more robust limit on the strength of the self-interaction, $G_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, which at present suffers from bimodality in cosmological constraints. Our forecast analysis reveals that BAO data alone will not provide the precision needed to tightly constrain self-interactions; however, the combined analysis of the phase shift signature in both CMB and BAO can potentially provide a way to detect the impact of new neutrino interactions. Our results could be extended upon for models with non-universal interactions.",

We assume that neutral hydrogen and helium in a homogeneous intergalactic medium are predominantly in their ground states and absorb radiation from distant sources through the Lyman-series lines and continua of HI, HeI, and HeII. We compute the wavelength-dependent optical depths in the first 40 Lyman-series lines of HI and HeII, in the first 10 Lyman-series lines of HeI, as well as in the corresponding Lyman continua, and use them to derive spectral transmittance functions of the intergalactic medium, $S(\\lambda;z)$. We show that spectral features in the continuous spectra of sources at $5\\lesssim z\\lesssim7$ are particularly sensitive to the reionization histories of both hydrogen and helium.

This version is updated with the accepted version. 31 pages, including 17 figures and appendices Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Early results from JWST suggest that epoch-of-reionization (EoR) galaxies produce copious ionizing photons, which, if they escape efficiently, could cause reionization to occur too early. We study this problem using \\jwst\\ imaging and prism spectroscopy for 412 galaxies at 4.5 < z < 9.0. We fit these data simultaneously with stellar-population and nebular-emission models that include a parameter for the fraction of ionizing photons that escape the galaxy, $f_\\mathrm{esc}$. We find that the ionization production efficiency, $\\xi_\\mathrm{ion}$ = Q(H) / L(UV), increases with redshift and decreasing UV luminosity, but shows significant scatter, $\\sigma( \\log \\xi_\\mathrm{ion})$ = 0.3 dex. The inferred escape fractions averaged over the population are low, ranging from $\\langle f_\\mathrm{esc} \\rangle$ = $2.6\\pm 1.4$\\% at 6 < z < 9 to $6.5\\pm 2.2$\\% at 4.5 < z < 6 with weak or no indication of evolution with redshift. This implies that in our models most of the ionizing photons need to be absorbed to account for the nebular emission. We compute the impact of our results on reionization, including the distributions for $\\xi_\\mathrm{ion}$ and $f_\\mathrm{esc}$, and the evolution and uncertainty of the UV luminosity function. Considering galaxies brighter than M(UV) < -16 mag, we would produce an IGM hydrogen-ionized fraction of $x_e = 0.5$ at 5.3 < z < 5.8, possibly too late compared to constraints from from QSO sightlines. Including fainter galaxies, M(UV) < -14 mag, we obtain $x_e = 0.5$ at 6.0 < z < 8.1, fully consistent with QSO and CMB data. This implies that EoR galaxies produce plenty of ionizing photons, but these do not efficiently escape. This may be a result of high gas column densities combined with burstier star-formation histories, which limit the time massive stars are able to clear channels through the gas for ionizing photons to escape.",

These findings have prompted the development of several theoretical models for the early formation and growth of black holes, which are, however, difficult to differentiate. We report the metallicity measurement around a gravitationally lensed massive black hole at redshift 7.04 (classified as a Little Red Dot), hosted in a galaxy with very low dynamical mass. The weakness of the [OIII]5007 emission line relative to the narrow H$\\beta$ emission indicates extremely low metallicity, about $4\\times 10^{-3}$ solar, and even more metal poor in the surrounding few 100 pc. We argue that such properties cannot be uncommon among accreting black holes around this early cosmic epoch. Explaining such a low chemical enrichment in a system that has developed a massive black hole is challenging for most theories. Models assuming heavy black hole seeds (such as Direct Collapse Black Holes) or super-Eddington accretion scenarios struggle to explain the observations, although they can potentially reproduce the observed properties in some cases. Models invoking \"primordial black holes\" (i.e. putative black holes formed shortly after the Big Bang) may potentially explain the low chemical enrichment associated with this black hole, although this class of models also requires further developments for proper testing.",

However, validating the accuracy and reliability of the inferred posteriors remains a persistent challenge. In this work, we point out a simple diagnostic approach rooted in ensemble learning methods to assess the internal consistency of SBI outputs that does not require access to the true posterior. By training multiple neural estimators under identical conditions and evaluating their pairwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences, we define a consistency criterion that quantifies agreement across the ensemble. We highlight two core use cases for this framework: a) for generating a robust estimate of the systematic uncertainty in parameter reconstruction associated with the training procedure, and b) for detecting possible model misspecification when using trained estimators on real data. We also demonstrate the relationship between significant KL divergences and issues such as insufficient convergence due to, e.g., too low a simulation budget, or intrinsic variance in the training process. Overall, this ensemble-based diagnostic framework provides a lightweight, scalable, and model-agnostic tool for enhancing the trustworthiness of SBI in scientific applications.",

Using the state-of-the-art cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG, we investigate how satellite galaxy abundance differs between filaments and the field, with filaments identified using the DisPerSE algorithm. When filaments are identified using galaxies as tracers, we find that, across all magnitude bins, central galaxies in filaments tend to host more satellite galaxies than their counterparts in the field, in qualitative agreement with observational results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The average ratios between satellite luminosity functions in filaments and the field are $3.49$, $2.61$, and $1.90$ in the central galaxy $r$-band magnitude bins of $M_{r, {\\rm cen}} \\sim -22$, $-21$, and $-20$, respectively. We show that much of this excess can be attributed to the higher host halo masses of galaxies in filaments. After resampling central galaxies in both environments to match the halo mass distributions within each magnitude bin, the satellite abundance enhancement in filaments is reduced by up to $79 \\%$. Additionally, the choice of tracers used to identify filaments introduces a significant bias: when filaments are identified using the dark matter density field, the environmental difference in satellite abundance is reduced by more than $70 \\%$; after further resampling in both magnitude and halo mass, the difference is further suppressed by another $\\sim 60$--$95 \\%$. Our results highlight the importance of halo mass differences and tracer choice biases when interpreting and understanding the impact of environment on satellite galaxy properties.",

IXPE detected significant polarization (15 sigma) from the source in the 2-8 keV energy band with an average polarization degree (PD) of 4.5% +/- 0.3% and a polarization angle (PA) of 128 +/- 2 degrees as the source moved along the horizontal branch of its Z-track. The PD increases with energy reaching 9.9% +/- 2.8% in the 7-8 keV band, with no evidence for energy-dependent variation in the PA. The PA is roughly consistent with previous measurements obtained during the normal and flaring branches and also with the known radio jet axis. From spectropolarimetric analysis, the main contribution to the polarized radiation is due to Comptonized photons, but the polarization is higher than predicted in typical spreading layer geometries. The observed high polarization may be due to a combination of a highly polarized reflected component and a moderately polarized spreading layer on the neutron star surface or produced by electron scattering in an equatorial wind.",

These Green's functions are mathematically very similar to the classical Lynden-Bell & Pringle solutions in the absence of outflows, but differ strongly in their precise physical details and observational implications. Solutions are presented for phenomenological radius-dependent outflows which both do and do not torque the local accretion flow, and for outflows which are launched proportional to the local accretion rate. Generically, outflows lead to a more rapid decay of the bolometric luminosity of the disk, flatten the radial dependence of the disk temperature, and suppress variability in the accretion rate at small radii and low frequencies (on long timescales). Observational implications of these four results are discussed in detail.",

Zhao 26 pages, 16 figures; submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) EP J171159.4-333253 is a new neutron-star low-mass X-ray binary discovered in outburst by the Einstein Probe (EP) on 2025 June 23, exhibiting clocked type-I X-ray bursts, eclipses and dips. In this paper, we report on the results of the X-ray spectral and timing analyses for EP J171159.4-333253 using data collected by EP and NuSTAR during the first 21 days of the outburst. The X-ray burst recurrence time can be characterized over a subset of nine bursts spanning 1.6 days around the NuSTAR observation, and the result is $t_{\\rm rec}=8196 \\pm 177\\,$s with indications of a possible decreasing trend. From the X-ray eclipse events, the binary orbital period and the eclipse duration are estimated to be $P_{\\rm orb}=6.48301 \\pm 0.00003\\,$hr and $D_{\\star,X} = 1245.5^{+6.9}_{-6.5}\\,$s, respectively. These enable an estimate of the mass and radius of the companion star and the binary inclination, which are $M_2\\approx0.6-0.8\\,M_\\odot$, $R_2\\approx0.7-0.8\\,R_\\odot$ and $i\\approx73-75^\\circ$, respectively. We also report on joint ULTRACAM and EP observations on 2025 July 21--22, detecting the source optical counterpart and covering an eclipse in both X-ray and optical bands. The optical eclipse is wavelength-dependent and broader than in X-rays, indicating that part of the optical emission arises from an extended region in the accretion flow. Despite a moderate variation in the source flux, the properties of the persistent X-ray emission are typical of a hard spectral state. We further evaluated the ratio of the accretion energy to the thermonuclear energy to be 120--130, implying helium bursts with the accreted hydrogen being depleted in-between bursts.",

Recent studies suggest that some active FRBs may originate from compact objects in binary systems. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework to model the multi-wavelength afterglows of FRBs resided in binary systems and apply it to two representative repeaters, FRB 20200120E and FRB 20201124A. By solving the dynamics and radiation processes of FRB ejecta interacting with the surrounding medium, we compute afterglow light curves in the radio, optical, and X-ray bands. Our results show that radio afterglows offer the best prospects for detection, with their brightness highly sensitive to ejecta kinetic energy and ambient density. Future high-sensitivity radio telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), could detect these signals. Optical afterglows, though short-lived and challenging to observe, may be significantly enhanced in dense environments, potentially making them detectable with facilities like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). In contrast, X-ray afterglows are predicted to be too faint for detection with current instruments. Our study highlights the potential of multi-wavelength afterglows as probes of FRB progenitors and their surrounding environments, offering crucial insights into the nature of these mysterious transients.",

While FRBs are primarily observed in the radio band, their potential multi-wavelength afterglows remain largely unexplored. We investigate the possible afterglow of FRB 20171020A, a rare nearby and bright FRB localized in a galaxy at only 37 Mpc. Assuming that this source produces a future bright burst, we model the expected afterglow emission in the radio, optical, and X-ray bands under both uniform and wind-like ambient media, within the framework of the magnetar model. Our results show that the optical afterglow is the most promising for detection, but it fades rapidly and requires follow-up within a few hundred seconds post-burst. The radio afterglow may be detectable under favorable conditions in a dense stellar wind, whereas the X-ray counterpart is too faint for current telescopes. These findings suggest that rapid optical follow-up offers the best opportunity to detect the afterglow of the next bright burst from FRB 20171020A, providing unique insights into the progenitor and its environment. To assess observational feasibility, we estimate the event rate of nearby FRBs with sufficient energy to power detectable afterglows, finding a rate of $\\sim$0.3 per year for CHIME surveys. Although this rate is low and the optical detection timescale is short, coordinated fast-response strategies using global telescope networks could significantly improve the chance of success. As more nearby FRBs are discovered, multi-wavelength observations will be essential in unveiling the physical nature of these enigmatic events.",

To clarify the nature of this object and its long periodicity, detailed timing studies were applied to its archival X-ray data, taken with ASCA (in 1993), XMM-Newton (in 2001, 2005, and 2016), and NuSTAR (2016 and 2017). It was assumed that the 6.67 hr period arises due to the beat between the rotation and free precession periods of the star that is slightly aspherical. By removing timing perturbations to be caused by this long periodicity, the six data sets consistently yielded evidence for pulsations at periods of P~1.01 s, to be interpreted as the objects' spin period, although the optimum energy range differed among the data sets. The measured six periods accurately line up on a linear spin-down trend of dP/dt = 1.097x 10^{-12} s/s. The object is implied to have a characteristic age of 14.7 kyr, a spin-down luminosity of 4.2x10^{34} erg/s, which is insufficient to power the X-ray luminosity, a dipole magnetic field of ~4.6x10^{13} G, and a toroidal field of ~7 x10^{15} G. Its similarity and dissimilarity to magnetars are discussed. An emission geometry, which crudely explain these results, is presented.",

We find (1) the disk always tends to align the SMO no matter what the initial orbital inclination $\\iota$ relative to the disk is, (2) the final orbital eccentricity of the SMO captured by the disk is always low though the orbital eccentricity may temporarily grow when the orbital inclination $\\iota$ is large and the SMO is an sBH, and (3) via collisions with the accretion disk only, only a small fraction of sBHs that are initially close to the SMBH and close to the disk can be captured by the disk within typical disk lifetime of active galactic nuclei. Two-body scatterings between SMOs in the nuclear stellar cluster play an essential role in randomly kicking sBHs towards the disk and boosting the capture rate.",

A prominent example is GRB~230307A, which exhibited a brief, highly coherent, energy-dependent periodic signal interpreted as the possible spin signature of a nascent millisecond magnetar formed after a compact binary merger. Motivated by these developments, we conducted a comprehensive search for similar signals, accounting for both temporal and spectral dependencies, in 532 short GRBs with time-tagged event data recorded by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) onboard the \\textit{Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory}. Within this sample, we identify a single statistically significant case: GRB~960616 (BATSE trigger~5502), in which the $\\sim$30~ms main emission episode is coherently modulated at 1100~Hz, with the strongest modulation above 320~keV and a fractional amplitude of $\\sim$47\\%.

The intermediate polar nature confirmation usually derives from the detection of two periods in both $X$-ray and optical photometry. In this respect, the high energy signal is often characterized by modulations on the white dwarf spin and the orbital period. However, noting that the periodograms may be characterized by strong features also at the synodic period and/or other sidebands, the timing analysis of the $X$-ray signal may offer the unique possibility to firmly discover an intermediate polar candidate. Here, we concentrate on a sample of five cataclysmic variable {binary} candidates: {i.e. SAXJ1748.2-2808, 1RXS J211336.1+542226, CXOGC J174622.7-285218, CXOGC J174517.4-290650, and V381 Vel, listed in the IPHome catalogue. Our main aim is to confirm if they belong to the intermediate polar class or not. The results of our analysis show that we can safely assess the intermediate polar nature of all the considered sources, apart for the case of V381 Vel which instead behaves like a cataclysmic variable of the polar subclass. Moreover, the source SAXJ1748.2-2808, previously classified as a HMXB, appears to be, most likely, an intermediate polar variable.",

Except two peculiar pulsars with quasi-periodic glitches, this stochastic view has prevailed. Here, by clustering temporally proximate small glitches of the Crab pulsar, we uncover clear evidence of an underlying quasi-periodic modulation, challenging the paradigm of purely random behavior. Furthermore, our correlation analyses reveal a strong positive relationship between glitch cluster size and waiting time since the preceding clusters. These findings demonstrate the effect of angular momentum reservoir operating over long-term scales and enable the predictions of next glitching window. Remarkably, two minor glitches detected in July and August 2025, which align with our initial prediction made in June, should be confirmed as the onset of this predicted activity. Inspired by the initial success, we forecast the occurrence of a major glitch from now until August 2026, with possible glitch size up to a relative change in rotational frequency of $697.2 \\times 10^{-9}$. Physically, the observed long-term quasi-periodicity and cluster size-waiting time correlations imply that each glitch event releases only a fraction of the stored superfluid angular momentum. This partial-release mechanism provides a unified framework for both stochastic and quasi-periodic glitch behaviors across different pulsars, underscoring the universality of the superfluid angular momentum reservoir effect. As the most intensively monitored object, the Crab pulsar serves as a natural laboratory for studying angular momentum inside neutron stars.",

We find correlated variability between the soft (0.3-0.7 keV) and hard (0.9-10 keV) bands on about 10^4 s time-scales, and measure a soft lag of about 500 s. This behaviour is broadly consistent with the disk-corona reverberation scenario established in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Together with the previously reported strong hard X-ray emission and broad Fe K line, our results suggest the presence of a compact corona and prominent relativistic disk reflection in AT2021ehb. The unusually high blackbody temperature (peaking at about 200 eV) is difficult to reconcile with thermal emission from a standard accretion disk around a about 10^7 Msun black hole, and may instead be analogous to the soft excess commonly observed in AGNs, whose physical origin remains debated. Finally, the measured lags offer a possible explanation for the rapid X-ray flux decline that occurred only three days after the peak, pointing to a scenario in which the corona cools following a sudden loss of the magnetic support required to sustain it.",

      "abstract": "Reconciling the Systemic Kicks of Observed Millisecond Pulsars, Spider Pulsars, and Low-mass X-ray Binaries Paul Disberg, Arash Bahramian, Ilya Mandel 12 pages, 8 figures, submitted to ApJL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) have been proposed as evolutionary products of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) through a stage in which they are spider pulsars (i.e., redbacks and black widows). However, recent work has found that the systemic kicks of observed MSPs are significantly lower than the kicks of LMXBs and spiders, which appears to be in tension with this evolutionary model. We argue that this tension can be relieved, at least to some degree, by considering the fact that the observed MSPs are located at relatively short distances, whereas spider pulsars are located at greater distances and LMXBs are situated even further away. We model the distance-dependent kinematic bias for dynamically old objects, which favors observing objects that have received low kicks at short distances and correct the observed systemic kicks for this bias. We find that this kinematic bias can be big enough to close the gap between the MSP and LMXB kicks, although the spider pulsars appear to come from a slightly different systemic kick distribution, but this difference is not necessarily physical. All corrected systemic kick distributions are consistent with predictions from binary population synthesis for progenitor systems with a post-supernova orbital period of $P_{\\text{orb}}\\leq10\\,$d and a companion mass of $M_{c}\\leq1\\,M_{\\odot}$, where the natal kicks are calibrated to the velocities of young isolated pulsars. We conclude that the difference in observed systemic kicks is not necessarily in tension with a common origin for MSPs, spider pulsars, and LMXBs.",

Using observationally inferred CSM density distributions, we calculate the resulting neutrino fluxes and examine their dependence on key parameters, including the CSM density normalization $D_*$, outer radius $R_{\\rm csm}$, proton acceleration efficiency $\\epsilon_p$, and magnetic energy fraction $\\epsilon_B$. Detection prospects are assessed with a binned likelihood analysis for IceCube, indicating that nearby SNe with moderately dense, confined CSM can produce detectable signals, with a typical detection horizon of $\\sim 0.1$ - 1 Mpc. For a Galactic SN at $\\sim 10$ kpc, high-statistics neutrino data with detailed temporal and spectral information can constrain $D_*$, $R_{\\rm csm}$, and $\\epsilon_p$ to within a factor of $\\sim 10$ or to a precision of $\\sim 20\\%$, depending on the assumed values of $D_*$ and $R_{\\rm csm}$.

Our approach not only extends the existing 1-dimensional tools to three dimensions, but also introduces more flexible features to better respond to the needs of both theory and experiment. We first thoroughly validate the \\conexD framework for the simulation of both longitudinal and lateral features of air showers, in particular for a non-standard configuration of the framework in which different energy thresholds for modifications are applied. Moreover, we show that the implementations of the ad-hoc modifications in this configuration are consistent with the previous one-dimensional simulations.

We present a multiwavelength analysis covering 15 years of data, from August 2008 to March 2024, to contextualize this period of extreme gamma-ray activity within the long-term emission of the source. We analyzed a long-term, comprehensive, multiwavelength dataset from different facilities and projects from radio to gamma-rays. We identified the 7 most intense gamma-ray flaring periods and performed a kinematic analysis of Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data to determine whether new jet components emerged before or during these flares. For 2 of these flaring periods, we performed the modeling of the spectral energy distribution (SED). The VLBA-BU-BLAZAR and MOJAVE datasets reveal a new jet component appearing in both visibility datasets prior to the onset of one of the strongest gamma-ray flares. By comparing the timing of the VLBA-BU-BLAZAR knots ejection with the gamma-ray flaring periods, we constrained the setup of the SED modeling. We also found that the first gamma-ray flaring period is less Compton-dominated than the others. Our results suggest that the recent activity of OP 313 is triggered by new jet components emerging from the core and interacting with a standing shock. The {\\gamma}-ray emission likely arises from dusty torus photons upscattered via Inverse Compton (IC) by relativistic jet electrons. The SED modeling indicates that this component is less dominant during the first {\\gamma}-ray flaring period than the later ones.",

Cross-disciplinary efforts are needed in view of the many nuclear reactions that govern the chemical evolution of the universe, and occur in a broad range of stellar plasma conditions that require astrophysical exploration. Since the early identification of 'processes' of nucleosynthesis, new insights have been obtained on the complexity of nuclear reaction mechanisms. We use 12C induced capture and fusion processes to illustrate the challenge of low-energy measurements and of using theoretical methods to extrapolate measurements towards energy regimes within cosmic sources. Particle beam experiments at accelerator facilities above and deep underground simulate stellar reactions, new experimental facilities and methods complement these, and this is further complemented by improved theoretical tools to calculate the quantum effects of nuclear reactions at the various cosmic conditions. Astronomical signatures of cosmic nuclear reactions are deduced from light curves characterizing cosmic explosions through gamma-ray lines and presolar grains to the detection of rare neutrino particles from our Sun to distant cosmic events. High resolution spectroscopy of stars has been expanded to objects measured in the X-ray and the gamma energy range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Astro-seismology and isotopic analysis of meteoritic inclusions provide new tools. Chemical-evolution models describe the complex dynamics during the evolution of galaxies. This article summarizes the experimental and theoretical work, and the broad range of observational tools that test the experimental data and the theoretical interpretation of nuclear processes in the cosmos.",

We also present observations from the first 6 months of the DESI spare fiber program dedicated to transients. The program is run in coordination with a dedicated DECam time-domain survey, serving as a pathfinder for what we will be able to achieve in conjunction with the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We classify over 250 transients, of which the majority were previously unclassified. The sample comprises thermonuclear and core-collapse supernovae and tidal disruption events (TDEs), including a TDE observed before its discovery in imaging.

However, the origin of rTDEs remains unclear. In addition, no statistical research on rTDEs with time intervals $>5$ years has been made yet. In this work, we searched for rTDEs with time intervals of 5--19 years using CRTS data in a sample of 16 ZTF BTS TDEs at $z<0.05$. We found 2 rTDE candidates, AT 2019azh and AT 2024pvu, with time intervals of 13.2 and 17.1 years, respectively. The peak luminosities of CRTS flares are close to those of ZTF flares. For the CRTS flare of AT 2024pvu, using GALEX UV observations near the peak, we measured a blackbody temperature of $\\sim19500$ K, consistent with TDEs and higher than SNe. Moreover, we estimated the expected number of SNe in the sample to be $\\lesssim0.08$, and hence the probability that both CRTS flares are SNe is only 0.3\\%. Therefore, the possibility that both CRTS flares are SNe can be ruled out, and it is likely that both are TDEs. Using the two rTDEs, we inferred that the TDE rate is 2--3 orders of magnitude higher than the average over 5--19 years prior to TDE detection. Considering another two rTDEs with intervals of $\\sim$2 years in the sample and possible rTDEs missed by CRTS, rTDEs with intervals of $<20$ years may account for 25\\%--60\\% of the TDE sample. We prefer to explain rTDEs as repeating partial TDEs, but the possibility of independent TDEs cannot be ruled out and requires future observational tests.",

(2023), in which an incipient jet was manually injected into the realistic environment imported from a previous general-relativistic MHD simulation of a merging BNS system. The jet evolution is followed up to almost 10 seconds without loss of resolution. Our results reveal that the jet faces challenges in penetrating the dense surroundings, leading to a barely successful outflow that exhibits structural asymmetries and low Lorentz factors. By the end of the extended simulation, 98% of the jet energy is converted to kinetic form and its angular structure is stabilized. The physical quantities inferred thus provide reliable inputs for afterglow emission calculations. This work demonstrates a method for simulating jets in 3D up to nearly ballistic regimes that is general and ready to be applied to any jet in a BNS merger context.",

Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) When an object is scattered near a supermassive black hole (SMBH), tidal oscillations excited within it reduce its orbital energy, leading to capture by the SMBH. This process, called tidal capture, can also occur when the object approaches even closer to the SMBH, resulting in a partial tidal disruption event (pTDE). Previous studies on pTDEs of main-sequence stars have shown that as the disruption intensifies, dynamical effects dominate over tidal oscillations, causing the remnant material to acquire a kick velocity instead of being captured by the SMBH. In this work, we performed hydrodynamic numerical simulations of pTDEs involving giant stars. We found that for weaker disruptions, the dynamical behavior of the remnant material resembles that of main-sequence stars. However, as the disruptions deepen, the remnant material transitions from gaining energy to losing energy, leading to capture by the SMBH. This behavior markedly differs from that of main-sequence stars, demonstrating that the presence of a compact core significantly influences the dynamical processes in pTDEs. Our simulations reveal that the energy change of the remnant material strongly correlates with asymmetric mass -- lossspecifically, the difference in mass outflow between the Lagrange points L1 and L2. This suggests that the energy change stems from asymmetric mass loss, consistent with conclusions from previous studies on main-sequence stars. However, quantitative analysis contradicts earlier models, indicating that the dynamical model of pTDEs requires further refinement. Finally, we discuss the characteristics of repeating pTDEs produced by this process and their potential observability, as well as the implications for the long-term orbital evolution of high eccentricity extreme mass ratio inspiral systems.",

Matthews, Dipanjan Mukherjee, Bhargav Vaidya High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate the impact of flickering variability in jet power on the luminosity and morphology of radio galaxies. We use a Lagrangian particle method together with relativistic hydrodynamics simulations using the PLUTO code to track the evolution of electron spectra through particle acceleration at shocks and cooling processes. We introduce an adapted version of this method which improves tracking of adiabatic cooling in regimes where low density jet material mixes with high density from the ambient medium in the lobes. We find that rapid increases in jet power can lead to large increases in hotspot luminosity due to the interaction of a travelling shock structure with the pre-existing shock structure at the jet head. We show that in some cases it may be possible to identify a bright region of emission corresponding to a shock travelling along the jet axis. We find that the time-averaged radiative efficiency of variable jets is similar to their steady counterparts, but find significant departures from this on an instantaneous basis. We suggest that, together with environmental effects and differences in the average powers of jets, variable jet powers may have a significant impact on how we understand the diversity of radio jets seen in observations and have significant implications for interpretations of jet powers, energy budgets and luminosity-linear size diagrams.",

Dar, Zahoor Malik Accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a comprehensive temporal and spectral study of the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS~0402$-$362 using \\textit{Fermi}-LAT/Swift-XRT/UVOT observations spanning from MJD 54686-60321. The $\\gamma$-ray light curve exhibits multiple phases of enhanced activity, with the fractional variability parameter ($F_{\\mathrm{var}}$) showing larger amplitudes at longer timescales, consistent with variability trends observed in other FSRQs. Statistical analysis of the flux and spectral index distributions using the Anderson--Darling test and histogram fitting reveals that both distributions deviate from a single log-normal form and are better represented by a double log-normal profile, indicating two distinct flux states. A search for quasi-periodic oscillations in the $\\gamma$-ray emission using the Lomb--Scargle periodogram identified a significant periodic signal at $\\sim$413~days with a confidence level exceeding $3\\sigma$. However the proximity of the timescale to one year and limited number of observed cycles prevents a definitive interpretation. Broadband spectral energy distributions for six flux states were modeled using a one-zone leptonic framework incorporating synchrotron, synchrotron self-Compton (SSC), and external Compton (EC) components. The SEDs are well reproduced with physically reasonable parameters: high-flux states exhibit harder electron spectra and lower magnetic field strengths ($B \\sim 0.2--0.6\\,\\mathrm{G}$), while low-flux states show softer spectra and stronger magnetic fields ($B \\sim 1.3\\,\\mathrm{G}$). The fitted break energy decreases during high-flux states, suggesting enhanced radiative cooling and a transition toward a particle- or kinetic-energy-dominated jet. These trends are consistent with the ``harder-when-brighter'' behavior commonly observed in blazars.",

Submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We analyze the polarization of optically thin, stationary, axisymmetric black hole jets at scales of order the light cylinder radius. Our work generalizes the face-on results of Gelles et al. (2025) to arbitrary viewing inclination. Due to a combination of geometry and relativistic aberration, the polarization of the jet is not left-right symmetric, and the degree of asymmetry can shed light on both the viewing angle and the plasma bulk Lorentz factor. We show that there is always a radius in the jet at which the polarization transitions from azimuthal to radial; this radius is different along the spine and limb of the jet. We propose metrics that can be used to constrain the black hole spin, inclination angle, and plasma Lorentz factor from these polarimetric signatures, and we discuss the impact of limb-brightening on these measurements. We anticipate that these polarimetric signatures can be studied with current or forthcoming data in M87, NGC 315, NGC 4261, Centaurus A, Cygnus A, and other systems. Observations of the polarization of the base of the counter-jet in higher inclination sources would provide a particularly promising probe of black hole spin.",

Burke, Priyamvada Natarajan Perspective piece published in Nature Astronomy High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Between the groundbreaking detections of stellar-mass black holes by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA and JWST's revelation of a surprisingly abundant population of supermassive black holes, one crucial missing link remains: the elusive intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). IMBHs represent a key phase in the hierarchical growth of black holes, yet they have persistently evaded detection. Traditional methods, effective for both actively accreting and quiescent black holes, have largely failed to uncover this hidden population. Here, we argue that novel observational strategies--particularly time-domain variability studies of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and tidal disruption events--provide a promising path forward. Finding IMBHs will resolve critical gaps in our understanding of black hole formation and the various mechanisms driving their subsequent growth. The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory, with its unprecedented capacity to monitor the dynamic sky, stands to revolutionize our ability to detect these long-sought IMBHs, shedding new light on the assembly history of black holes across cosmic time.",

Ho, Paul Ho 15 pages, 8 figures, Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) In Very-Long Baseline Interferometric arrays, nearly co-located stations probe the largest scales and typically cannot resolve the observed source. In the absence of large-scale structure, closure phases constructed with these stations are zero and, since they are independent of station-based errors, they can be used to probe data issues. Here, we show with an expansion about co-located stations, how these trivial closure phases become non-zero with brightness distribution on smaller scales than their short baseline would suggest. When applied to sources that are made up of a bright compact and large-scale diffuse component, the trivial closure phases directly measure the centroid relative to the compact source and higher-order image moments. We present a technique to measure these image moments with minimal model assumptions and validate it on synthetic Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data. We then apply this technique to 2017 and 2018 EHT observations of M87* and find a weak preference for extended emission in the direction of the large-scale jet. We also apply it to 2021 EHT data and measure the source centroid about 1 mas northwest of the compact ring, consistent with the jet observed at lower frequencies.",

Complementary high frequency radio data with the Australia Telescope Compact Array are presented to track in more detail the evolution of GX339-4 and its transient ejecta. During the five years, GX339-4 has been through two \"hard-only\" outbursts and two \"full\" outbursts, allowing us to densely sample the rise, quenching and re-activation of the compact jets. Strong radio flares were also observed close to the transition between the hard and the soft states. Following the radio flare, a transient optically thin ejection was spatially resolved during the 2020 outburst, and was observed for a month. We also discuss the radio/X-ray correlation of GX339-4 during this five year period, which covers several states in detail from the rising phase to the quiescent state. This campaign allowed us to follow ejection events and provide information on the jet proper motion and its intrinsic velocity. With this work we publicly release the weekly MeerKAT L-band radio maps from data taken between September 2018 and October 2023.",

Reynoso 15 pages, 19 figures, accepted for publication in Astroparticle Physics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are point-like sources that exhibit apparent X-ray luminosities exceeding the Eddington limit for stellar-mass compact objects. A widely accepted interpretation is that these systems are X-ray binaries accreting matter possibly at super-Eddington rates. In this regime, photon trapping inflates the accretion disk, making it geometrically and optically thick. Radiation-driven winds launched from the supercritical disk form funnel-shaped walls along the symmetry axis. While the apparent X-ray luminosity can exceed the Eddington limit due to geometrical beaming within this funnel, a misalignment with the observer's line of sight strongly suppresses the X-ray emission, rendering the ULX electromagnetically obscured. This work explores the potential for high-energy neutrino production in black hole-hosting ULXs. We model proton acceleration via magnetic reconnection in the region above the super-accreting black hole. Although electromagnetic emission is efficiently absorbed by the dense wind and radiation fields, neutrinos generated from photomeson interactions can escape. Our model self-consistently accounts for energy losses of pions and muons in this environment. The results indicate that misaligned, electromagnetically obscured Galactic ULXs could produce a neutrino flux detectable by instruments like KM3NeT and IceCube within several years of observation.",

Using a sample of 43 pulsars detected in both X-ray and gamma-ray bands, we find that pulsars' gamma-ray luminosity, $L_\\gamma$, clearly correlates with the luminosity of non-thermal X-ray emission, $L_{\\rm p}$, and anti-correlates with non-thermal X-ray photon index. Other gamma-ray spectral parameters show weaker or negligible correlations. The found relation that $L_\\gamma \\propto L_{\\rm p}^{0.49\\pm 0.05}$ implies a certain connection between radiation mechanisms and energy distributions of radiating particles for these high-energy emissions. Pulsars with and without detected thermal emissions seem to show different dependencies in those correlations, suggesting the possible existence of two different kinds of pulsars. The ones without detected thermal emissions may represent a population of pulsars with low surface temperature. The origin and energetics of high-energy emitting electron-positron pairs for this group of pulsars probably do not depend on their surface thermal emissions, while that of the other group do. The low surface temperatures might be evidence for the working of some exotic processes of neutron-star cooling. Similar to $L_{\\rm p}$, some tempting relationships are found among each gamma-ray spectral parameter, surface temperature and thermally radiating area radius. It again strengthens the connection between gamma-ray and X-ray emissions from pulsars.",

No X-ray polarization was detected in the 2-8 keV band, with a 99\\% confidence upper limit of $\\leq$2.9\\%, further reduced to $\\leq$2.5\\% when combined with the two past IXPE observations of the same target. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that equatorial coronal models are disfavored if the AGN is indeed a type-1.9/2 AGN, but coronae coplanar to the accretion disk remain consistent if the source is less inclined than previously assumed. \\textit{VLT}/FORS2 data reveal a typical type-2 spectrum in total flux, a broad H$\\alpha$ line in polarized flux, and strongly wavelength dependent polarization degree and angle, rotating by nearly 70$^\\circ$ across the optical band. Comparison with historical measurements confirms long-term stability of the polarization spectrum and a $\\sim$90$^\\circ$ rotation in the near-ultraviolet. Interpreting the multi-wavelength polarization relative to the AGN ionization axis indicates that the main obscurer is not a compact circumnuclear torus, but a distant kpc-scale dust lane crossing the galaxy. This result implies that MCG-05-23-16 is in fact a type-1 AGN seen through foreground dust. The low X-ray column density becomes consistent with the absence of polarization, provided that the nuclear inclination is low.",

With 17-yr Fermi-LAT monitoring, we reveal persistent secular evolution and enhanced spin-down rate variability within individual emission states -- beneath the quasi-periodic state transitions. After removing discrete jumps, the jump-corrected flux $\\delta F_\\gamma$ shows a three-phase evolution: rise ($+2.02^{+0.17}_{-0.15}\\%~\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), decline ($-3.72^{+0.34}_{-0.47}\\%~\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), and rapid rise ($+14.9^{+6.4}_{-4.4}\\%~\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), with all rates quoted relative to the long-term mean flux $\\langle F_\\gamma \\rangle=7.8\\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{erg}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Moreover, the flux of the LGF state is gradually approaching the stable HGF level at a rate of $+0.72 \\pm 0.11\\%~\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. These results demonstrate that secular flux evolution in PSR J2021+4026 operates largely independently of discrete state transitions, yet jointly with them drives the system toward a stable high-flux equilibrium.",

Using a quasi-static equilibrium approach, we follow the Kelvin--Helmholtz evolution from hot, lepton-rich matter to a cold, catalyzed quark star. Rotation substantially enhances the maximum stable mass (by up to $\\sim 40\\%$), equatorial radius, and key rotational observables, with the ratio of rotational kinetic to gravitational potential energy, $T_{\\rm kin}/|W|$, reaching $0.18$--$0.19$ near the Keplerian limit, indicating a heightened susceptibility to gravitational-wave--emitting instabilities. Thermal evolution introduces a clear ordering: all stellar properties peak during the lepton-rich stages and decrease monotonically as the star cools. Compared to hadronic stars, rotating protoquark stars exhibit larger radii, higher moments of inertia, and stronger quadrupolar deformation, producing a distinct signature in the mass--radius--spin plane that can accommodate objects such as HESS~J1731--347 and PSR~J0740+6620. These results demonstrate that future multimessenger observations must account for both thermal history and rotation to robustly identify quark matter in compact stars.",

SMC X-1 shows unique quasi-periodic flux variability of 40-65$\\,$days known as superorbital modulation. To constrain the accretion structure of SMC X-1 based on timing and spectral study, we have analysed X-ray data of SMC X-1 observed by Suzaku and NuSTAR at various epochs between 2011 and 2022. The spectral analysis shows that the hydrogen column density ($N_\\mathrm{H}$) increases from $1.1 \\times 10^{22}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ to $1.24 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ as the flux decreases with the superorbital modulation. The neutral iron K$\\alpha$ line at 6.4$\\,$keV has a broad width of 0.3$\\,$keV, and its equivalent width increases as toward superorbital low states. The line broadening is consistent with Keplerian motion at the inner disc rather than the stellar wind velocity of the donor star. These findings support that the superorbital modulation is a consequence of X-ray attenuation by the warped accretion disc. To test this interpretation, we have conducted photon transport simulations of a system consisting of a neutron star, a warped disc, and optically-thin disc atmosphere. Occultation of the central source by the disc successfully reproduces the observed variations in the equivalent width of neutral iron K$\\alpha$ line, pulse profiles, and flux in hard X-rays. Notably, a disc precession angle of approximately $30^\\circ$ can account for the observational features. For the radiation pattern of the photon source, the preferred beam width corresponds to a standard deviation of $30^\\circ$.",

      "abstract": "Unveiling Hidden Clustering: An Unsupervised Machine Learning Study of Repeating FRB 20220912A An-Chieh Hsu, Tetsuya Hashimoto, Tomotsugu Goto, Tomoki Wada, Bjorn Jasper Raquel High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients of extragalactic origin. Classifying repeating FRBs is essential for understanding their emission mechanisms, but remains challenging due to their short durations, high variability, and increasing data volume. Traditional methods often rely on subjective criteria and struggle with high-dimensional data. In this study, we apply an unsupervised machine learning framework that combines Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to eight observed parameters from FRB 20220912A. Our analysis reveals three distinct clusters of bursts with varying spectral and fluence properties. Comparisons with clustering studies on other repeaters show that some of our clusters share similar features with sources such as FRB 20201124A and FRB 121102, suggesting possible common emission mechanisms. We also provide qualitative interpretations for each cluster, highlighting the spectral diversity within a single source. Notably, one cluster shows broadband emission and high fluence, which are typically seen in non-repeating FRBs. This raises the possibility that some non-repeaters may be misclassified repeaters due to observational limitations. Our results demonstrate the utility of machine learning in uncovering intrinsic diversity in FRB emission and provide a foundation for future classification studies.",

A long-lasting X-ray emission was discussed as afterglows following several short-duration ($\\lesssim$2 s) bursts, yet this prompt X-ray component was not directly observed or confirmed. Here we report the discovery of a minutes-long ($\\sim$560 s) flash of soft X-rays immediately following the short ($\\sim$0.4 s) GRB 250704B. The long-soft bump points to a distinct phase of prompt emission in X-rays detected by Einstein Probe in an event that otherwise appear as an ordinary short GRB, showing that long-lasting X-ray emission is likely a common feature of merger-driven bursts and a promising electromagnetic counterpart to gravitational-wave sources.",

Optical monitoring of the source by members of the American Association of Variable Star Observers reveals a decrease of ~0.5 mag that lasted ~50 d in early 2025. During the low state the optical timing properties imply that BG CMi underwent a change in the accretion mode, as power at the spin frequency $\\omega$ dramatically dropped. An XMM-Newton observation revealed a substantial decrease in intrinsic absorption and a slight increase in intrinsic X-ray luminosity, compared to archival Suzaku data. Timing analysis of the X-ray light curves shows that power shifted from the orbital frequency $\\Omega$ (prominent in Suzaku data) to $2\\Omega$ in the low state XMM-Newton data, along with the strengthening of certain orbital sidebands. We suggest that BG CMi transitioned to disk-overflow accretion, where the white dwarf accreted matter via both a disk and a stream, the latter becoming more dominant during the low state due to a decrease in the mass and size of the disk.",

Boula, M. E. Ravasio, G. Ghisellini 19 pages, 8 figures. Submitted to A&A. Comments are welcome! High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) GRB~221009A has been the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) observed to date, and its afterglow has been characterised with unprecedented detail at TeV energies by LHAASO. Quite puzzlingly, it is also the most energetic GRB known. Among the riddles posed by this mysterious source, however, the sheer energetics are hardly the most intriguing: an unprecedented, narrow, luminous emission line at around 10 MeV has been uncovered by a detailed spectral analysis of \\textit{Fermi}/GBM data immediately following the brightest peak in the GRB prompt emission and the peak of the TeV afterglow. As noted in the discovery article, the temporal evolution of the line properties can be explained as being due to high-latitude emission from a geometrically thin, relativistically expanding shell where annihilation of a large number of electron-positron pairs took place. We show that this interpretation yields stringent constraints on the properties of such shell, that point to a process that happens at radii typical of external shocks. We then demonstrate that the shell could have been the blastwave associated with the GRB precursor, with the line arising after pair loading of such blastwave as it was illuminated by the bright and hard radiation of the GRB main event. The scenario, which also explains the abrupt initial rise of the LHAASO afterglow, requires the progenitor of the GRB to have been surrounded by a circum-stellar medium (CSM) extending out to a few $10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, with a density $n_\\mathrm{ext}\\sim 10^{8}-10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ reminiscent of those found from studies of Type IIn supernovae. This provides a precious clue to the nature of the progenitor of this peculiar GRB, which could also be present in other bursts that feature a long quiescence followed by a bright emission episode with a hard spectrum.",

Denton, Dan Scolnic, Anze Slosar, Chris Walter 12 pages, 9 figures, submitted to Open Journal of Astrophysics Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Supernovae are observed to occur approximately 1-2 times per century in a galaxy like the Milky Way. Based on historical records, however, the last core-collapse galactic supernova observed by humans occurred almost 1,000 years ago. Luckily, we are well positioned to catch the next one with the advent of new neutrino detectors and astronomical observatories. Neutrino observatories can provide unprecedented triggers for a galactic supernova event as they are likely to see a supernova neutrino signal anywhere from minutes to days before the shock breakout causes the supernova to brighten in optical wavelengths. Given its large etendue, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory is ideally positioned to rapidly localize the optical counterpart based on the neutrino trigger. In this paper we simulate events to study the efficiency with which supernovae are optimally localized by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. We find that the observatory is ideal for initial localization of nearly all observable supernova triggers and has a 57-97% chance of catching any supernova based on theoretical stellar mass density predictions and observations. We provide an analysis of optimal filter selection and exposure times and discuss observational caveats.",

Through the analysis of $\\textit{TESS}$ photometry combined with an extensive set of times of maximum light spanning 39 years, we identify BE Lyn as a high-amplitude $\\delta$ Scuti star in a binary with an orbital period of $\\approx15.9$ years and an extraordinary orbital eccentricity of $e=0.9989^{+0.0008}_{-0.0021}$ ($>0.9968$ at 95% confidence) -- the highest reliably measured for any binary system. Dynamical constraints impose an upper limit on the orbital inclination of $i \\lesssim 4.0^{\\circ}$, corresponding to a companion mass of $M_2 \\gtrsim 17.5~M_{\\odot}$, which unequivocally favors a black hole. This system provides a unique laboratory for studying asteroseismology in strong gravitational fields, the formation of black holes via asymmetric supernovae, and the evolution of extreme binary systems. Our work demonstrates, for the first time, the successful application of the light-travel time effect in a pulsating variable to unveil a dormant black hole, establishing a novel method for BH detection in non-interacting binaries.",

Miles 10 + 1 pages, 9 figures, in print with Astronomy&Astrophysics Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have recently reported compelling evidence for the presence of a gravitational-wave background signal. Mapping the gravitational-wave background is key to understanding how it is formed, since anisotropy is a tracer for, for example, a supermassive black hole binary origin. In this work we refine the frequentist regularised gravitational-wave mapping analysis developed in our previous work (as part of the MeerKAT PTA 4.5-year data release). We derive a point-spread function describing the angular resolution of a PTA. We investigate how the point spread function changes for different PTA constellations and determine the best possible angular resolution achievable within our framework. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that previous methods do not capture the actual resolution - especially in regions of the sky with a high density of pulsars. We propose an improved scheme that accounts for a variable local resolution and test it using realistic simulations of the latest MeerKAT dataset. We demonstrate that we are able to identify a continuous gravitational wave signal in a region with good pulsar sky coverage with approximately a factor of two increase in significance compared to our previous method.",

We have used a hybrid approach to the nuclear EOS developed recently where the matter around nuclear saturation density is described by a parametric expansion in terms of nuclear empirical parameters and represented in an agnostic way at higher density using piecewise polytropes. We have incorporated the inputs provided by the latest neutron skin measurement experiments from PREX-II and CREX, simultaneous mass-radius measurements of pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, and the gravitational wave events GW170817 and GW190425. The main results of the study show the effect of HESS J1731-347 on the nuclear parameters and neutron star observables. Our analysis yields the slope of symmetry energy $L=45.71^{+38.18}_{-22.11}$ MeV, the radius of a $1.4 M_\\odot$ star, $R_{1.4}=12.18^{+0.71}_{-0.88}$ km, and the maximum mass of a static star, $M_{\\rm max}= 2.14^{+0.26}_{-0.17} M_\\odot$ within $90\\%$ confidence interval, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Impact of multi-messenger spectral modelling on blazar-neutrino associations Julian Kuhlmann, Francesca Capel Updated to match published version High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Blazars are interesting source candidates for astrophysical neutrino emission. Multi-messenger lepto-hadronic models based on proton-photon (p-gamma) interactions result in predictions for the neutrino spectra (''p-gamma spectra'') which are typically strongly peaked at PeV energies. In contrast, statistical analyses looking to associate blazars and high-energy neutrinos often assume a power-law spectral shape, putting the emphasis at lower energies. We aim to examine the impact of such spectral modelling assumptions on the associations of neutrinos with blazars. We use hierarchical_nu, a Bayesian framework for point source searches, and incorporate the theoretical predictions for neutrino spectra through a dedicated spectral model and priors on the relevant parameters. Our spectral model is based on recent predictions for a selection of intermediate and high synchrotron peaked blazars that have been found to be spatially close to high-energy events detected by IceCube. We apply our model to the 10 years of publicly available muon track IceCube data aimed at point source searches, focusing on the Northern hemisphere. Out of 29 source candidates, we find five sources, including TXS 0506+056, that have an association probability $P_\\mathrm{assoc} > 0.5$ to at least one event. The p-gamma spectra typically lead to a lower overall number of associated events compared to the power-law case, but retain or even enhance strong associations to high-energy events. Our results demonstrate that including more information from theoretical predictions can allow for more interpretable source-neutrino connections.",

Accepted for publication in ApJL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We study the origin of the ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrino event KM3-230213A detected by KM3NeT, focusing on MRC 0614-083 which has been pinpointed as the closest blazar to the neutrino localization exhibiting variable multi-wavelength emission. A joint interpretation of the optical, infrared, and X-ray light curves suggests that MRC 0614-083 has undergone a super-Eddington accretion flare accompanied by efficient proton acceleration. That flare has initiated a delayed infrared echo within the surrounding dust torus, which serves as a target for photomeson ($p\\gamma$) interactions such that a self-consistent picture emerges that complements the blazar jet scenario: the predicted UHE neutrino flux is at the level expected from joint $E^{-2}$ fit with the IceCube measurements at lower energies, the variable nature of the event alleviates the tension with IceCube limits, and the accompanying electromagnetic cascade describes the X-ray flare around the neutrino detection time. Since a key remaining uncertainty is the unknown redshift of the source, we strongly encourage optical/ultraviolet spectroscopic measurements to determine its redshift.",

Data in fig. 6 are available at this https URL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th) We present a new, state-of-the-art computation of the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB), where we use neutrino spectra from multi-dimensional, multi-second core collapse supernova simulations - including both neutron-star and black-hole forming collapses - and binary evolution effects from modern population synthesis codes. Large sets of numerical results are processed and connected in a consistent manner, using two key quantities: the mass of the star's Carbon-Oxygen (CO) core at an advanced pre-collapse stage - which depends on binary evolution effects - and the compactness parameter, which is the main descriptor of the post-collapse neutrino emission. The method enables us to model the neutrino emission of a very diverse, binary-affected population of stars, which cannot unambiguously be mapped in detail by existing core collapse simulations. We find that including black hole-forming collapses enhances the DSNB by up to 50% at energies greater than 30-40 MeV. Binary evolution effects can change the total rate of collapses and generate a sub-population of high core mass stars that are stronger neutrino emitters. However, the net effect on the DSNB is moderate - up to a 15% increase in flux - due to the rarity of these super-massive cores and to the relatively modest dependence of the neutrino emission on the CO core mass. The methodology presented here is suitable for extensions and generalizations, and therefore it lays the foundation for modern treatments of the DSNB.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Crust quakes are frequently invoked as a mechanism to trigger sudden transients in the magnetospheres of magnetars. In this picture, a mechanical failure of the crust excites seismic motions of the magnetar surface that launch force-free waves into the magnetosphere. We first investigate this problem analytically and then perform three-dimensional numerical simulations. Our simulations follow the propagation of high-frequency magneto-elastic waves in the entire crust, and include magnetic coupling to the dipolar magnetosphere and liquid core through simplified radiation boundary conditions. We observe seismic waves bouncing between the crust-core interface and the surface with a characteristic frequency $\\sim 1$~kHz, which could appear as a modulation of the magnetospheric radiation. Both the star quake and its associated magnetospheric wave emission are strongly damped on a timescale $\\sim 10 \\ \\rm ms$ by magnetic coupling to the liquid core. Since the seismic waves are significantly damped before they can spread laterally around the crust, magnetospheric wave emission occurs primarily near the initial epicenter of the quake. Our simulations suggest that non-axisymmetric quakes will launch a mixture of Alfvén and fast magnetosonic waves into the magnetosphere. The results will be important for interpreting magnetar bursts and understanding the possible trigger mechanisms of fast radio bursts.",

MAXI J1744-294 was never observed in outburst prior to January 2025. We present the results of a broadband, multi-wavelength study of MAXI J1744-294, including data from the NuSTAR, Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift, and NICER X-ray telescopes, as well as complementary radio and near-infrared observations. We analyze the changing X-ray emission as the outburst evolved from the high/soft to the low/hard state. Using relativistic reflection features in the data, we estimate a spin of $a>0.92$ and viewing inclination $\\theta=28^{+3}_{-4}$ deg. Based on the spectral and temporal characteristics of the source, we identify MAXI J1744-294 as a candidate black hole (BH) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) -- the fourth candidate BH transient discovered within a (projected) distance of one pc from the Galactic supermassive black hole Sgr A*. This discovery provides further evidence for a cusp of BH-LMXBs in the central pc of our Galaxy, as argued for in previous observational studies and suggested by analytical and theoretical work.

Telkamp Accepted for publication in MNRAS, see this https URL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Time-variable propagation effects provide a window into the local plasma environments of repeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources. Here we report high-cadence observations of FRB 20240619D, as part of the HyperFlash and ÉCLAT programs. We observed for $500$h and detected $217$ bursts, including $10$ bursts with high fluence ($>25$ Jy ms) and implied energy. We track burst-to-burst variations in dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM), from which we constrain the parallel magnetic field strength in the source's local environment: $0.27\\pm0.13$ mG. Apparent DM variations between sub-bursts in a single bright event are interpreted as coming from plasma lensing or variable emission height. We also identify two distinct scintillation screens along the line of sight, one associated with the Milky Way and the other likely located in the FRB's host galaxy or local environment. Together, these (time-variable) propagation effects reveal that FRB 20240619D is embedded in a dense, turbulent and highly magnetised plasma. The source's environment is more dynamic than that measured for many other (repeating) FRB sources, but less extreme compared to several repeaters that are associated with a compact, persistent radio source. FRB 20240619D's cumulative burst fluence distribution shows a power-law break, with a flat tail at high energies. Along with previous studies, this emphasises a common feature in the burst energy distribution of hyperactive repeaters. Using the break in the burst fluence distribution, we estimate a source redshift of $z=0.042$-$0.240$. We discuss FRB 20240619D's nature in the context of similar studies of other repeating FRBs.",

Accepted by ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are believed to be an ideal laboratory for studying the evolution of accretion flow around a supermassive black hole (BH). In general, the mass feeding rate to the BH is suggested to be super-Eddington initially, and evolves to be sub-Eddington on timescales of years. In this paper, we carry out calculations of the time-dependent evolution of accretion disk in the standard environment of TDE, i.e., injecting matter at the circularization radius of the stellar debris in the form of $\\dot M_{\\rm inject} \\propto t^{-5/3}$. One of the main findings is that when $\\dot M_{\\rm inject}$ evolves to a value around the Eddington accretion rate, the radiation pressure instability occurs. We test the influence of the model parameters on the light curves, such as the BH mass $M_{\\rm BH}$, viscosity parameter $\\alpha$, and mass-injecting radius $R_{\\rm{out}}$, all of which are found to affect the light curves to some extent. In most cases, we find that the light curves oscillate significantly due to the radiation pressure instability. As an exception, when $\\alpha$ is small or $R_{\\rm{out}}$ is large, we find that the oscillations are completely suppressed. In this case, the light curve drops steeply and then becomes flat in the late-time evolution, which we apply to explain the observed ultraviolet (UV) light curves of ASASSN-15oi and ASASSN-14ae together with the assumption of a photosphere. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of our time-dependent accretion disk model to explaining multi-band light curves of TDEs in the future.",

Here we consider the apparently isolated subclass of LPRTs and argue that electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) explains their narrow duty cycles and polarisation properties. In particular, we show that intrinsically circular ECME can emerge as predominantly linear after undergoing Faraday conversion in an overlying magnetospheric plasma layer, thus reconciling the observed high linear fractions with a circularly polarised maser. In this picture, a rotating oblique magnetosphere beams radiation into a thin, hollow emission cone whose surface lies almost perpendicular to the local magnetic field. The observed very narrow pulses arise when the line of sight skims the cone, while broader profiles and weak leading or trailing components occur when multiple azimuths along the emission ring meet the maser resonance condition. The observed isotropic-equivalent luminosities of about 10^30 to 10^31 erg s^-1 correspond to modest intrinsic powers once strong ECME beaming is taken into account. We show that such power levels can be supplied by accretion from the interstellar medium (ISM), and that detectability at kiloparsec distances favours slowly rotating neutron stars with comparatively low surface magnetic fields below about 10^10 Gauss and low space velocities.",

Cosmic voids, defined by low galaxy densities and characterized by minimal environmental interactions, offer a natural laboratory for isolating the impact of large-scale underdensities on stellar evolution and transient production. Using multi-wavelength data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Sternberg Astronomical Institute Supernova Catalogue, and high-energy space observatories, we compare transient occurrence rates and host galaxy properties across environments. We find that core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are significantly more common in void galaxies, indicating that massive star formation remains active in underdense regions. In contrast, Type Ia supernovae are less frequent in voids, consistent with a scarcity of older stellar populations. Notably, we identify a short-duration GRB hosted by a void galaxy, demonstrating that compact object mergers can occur in isolated environments. Additionally, we find no FRBs associated with void galaxies. Taken together, these results show that cosmic voids exert a measurable influence on the star formation history of galaxies and hence on the production of transients.",

      "abstract": "Machine-learning approaches to dispersion measure estimation for fast radio bursts Hosein Rajabi, Zhejian Liu, Fereshteh Rajabi, Martin Houde 13 pages, 6 figures, and 8 tables High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, mostly millisecond-duration transients of extragalactic origin whose emission mechanisms remain unknown. As FRB signals propagate through ionized media, they experience frequency-dependent delays quantified by the dispersion measure (DM), a key parameter for inferring source distances and local plasma conditions. Accurate DM estimation is therefore essential for characterizing FRB sources and testing physical models, yet current dedispersion methods can be computationally intensive and prone to human bias. In this proof-of-concept study, we develop and benchmark three deep-learning architectures, a conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), a fine-tuned ResNet-50, and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model, for automated DM estimation. All models are trained and validated on a large set of synthetic FRB dynamic spectra generated using CHIME/FRB-like specifications. The hybrid CNN-LSTM achieves the highest accuracy and stability while maintaining low computational cost across the investigated DM range. Although trained on simulated data, these models can be fine-tuned on real CHIME/FRB observations and extended to future facilities, offering a scalable pathway toward real-time, data-driven DM estimation in large FRB surveys.",

To overcome the former, searches for gravitationally lensed sources allow for the discovery of magnified SNe that appear as multiple images - further providing the opportunity for efficient follow-up. Here we present the discovery of \"SN Eos\": a strongly lensed, multiply-imaged, SN II at a spectroscopic redshift of z = 5.133 +/- 0.001. SN Eos exploded in a Lyman-{\\alpha} emitting galaxy when the Universe was only ~1 billion years old, shortly after it reionized and became transparent to ultraviolet radiation. A year prior to our discovery in JWST data, archival HST imaging of SN Eos reveals rest-frame far ultraviolet (~1,300Å) emission, indicative of shock breakout or interaction with circumstellar material in the first few (rest-frame) days after explosion. The JWST spectroscopy of SN Eos, now the farthest spectroscopically confirmed SN ever discovered, shows that SN Eos's progenitor star likely formed in a metal-poor environment (<= 0.1 Z_{\\odot}), providing the first direct evidence of massive star formation in the metal-poor, early Universe. SN Eos would not have been detectable without the extreme lensing magnification of the system, highlighting the potential of such discoveries to eventually place constraints on the faint end of the cosmic star-formation rate density in the very early Universe.",

Katz High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) I suggest that some of the mysterious temporal properties of Fast Radio Bursts (FRB) may be explained if they are produced by dynamically triaxial magnetars. If the bursts are narrowly collimated along open field lines, then observed repeating FRB may be those in which the moment of inertia tensor is only slightly triaxial and the rotation axis, open field lines and radiation point nearly to the observer. Apparently non-repeating FRB may be triaxial with the direction of open field lines and radiation wandering across the sky, reducing their duty factors by several orders of magnitude. A slightly triaxial moment tensor in repeaters moves the line of sight into or out of the radiation pattern or within it, explaining periods of greater or lesser (or absent) activity, and making the probability of detecting a burst and hence the burst rate vary aperiodically. The dynamics of triaxial bodies might thwart the coherent integration of gravitational signals from rotating accreting neutron stars.",

Our results show that radiative cooling suppresses the transition to a MAD state by reducing magnetic flux accumulation near the horizon, modifies the disk structure via lower electron temperatures and increased equatorial density, and alters reconnection properties:compressing current sheets, shortening plasmoid lifetimes, and increasing their frequency. We also find enhanced negative energy-at-infinity density in plasmoids near the ergosphere. These findings indicate that radiative cooling critically shapes both large scale accretion dynamics and small-scale reconnection phenomena, potentially modulating black hole energy extraction through reconnection-driven Penrose processes.",

Submitted to ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic observations of the nearby Type II supernova SN\\,2024ggi from 250 and 581 days after the explosion. Comparing the evolution of the [\\ion{O}{1}] at 6300, 6363 \\textÅ doublet normalized to the continuum with spectral models from the literature, we estimate a progenitor star zero-age main-sequence mass ($M_{\\mathrm{ZAMS}}$) of $\\approx 14$ M$_\\odot$. This value is consistent with $M_{\\mathrm{ZAMS}}$ reported in the literature from independent methodologies. The nebular spectra are used to study the structure of the inner ejecta. The broad H$\\alpha$ line has a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of $\\simeq 3900$ km s$^{-1}$, with small deviations from a symmetric Gaussian profile centred at zero velocity, and the [\\ion{O}{1}] doublet is blue-shifted by $\\approx -940$ km s$^{-1}$. In the NIR, the nebular spectra reveal double-peaked emission features of \\ion{Mg}{1} and [\\ion{Fe}{2}] lines between +250 and +319 days, suggesting a bipolar distribution of intermediate mass and iron peak elements in the line-of-sight. Such a double-peaked feature in these NIR lines has not been previously reported. No corresponding asymmetries are observed in the hydrogen lines, suggesting that the asymmetry is mostly confined to intermediate mass and iron peak elements in the innermost core of the supernova ejecta. Additionally, we detect first-overtone carbon monoxide (CO) emission at 2.3,$\\mu$m between 250 and 319 days, and a blueshift in the emission lines of H$\\alpha$, [\\ion{O}{1}], \\ion{Mg}{1}], and [\\ion{Fe}{2}] in the +581 day optical spectrum, consistent with dust formation in the ejecta.",

Romano, Andreas Burkert 12 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables. Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The age of the Local Bubble (LB) constrains the timescale on which the interstellar medium in the solar neighborhood evolves. Previous estimates placed the age of the LB at \\sim 14 Myr, and attributed its expansion to \\sim 15-20 supernovae (SNe), yet a companion paper suggests this age may be overestimated. We place new constraints on the age of the LB and re-evaluate the question whether its expansion triggered or suppressed local star formation. We reconstruct the LB's geometry and momentum using publicly available 3D dust maps and compare them to the high-quality sample of simulated supernova remnants in the SISSI project. Independent constraints on the star-formation history and supernova rate are obtained from a Gaia DR3-based census of nearby star clusters. We find that \\sim 7-59 SNe over \\sim 5.8 Myr to \\sim 2.8 Myr, respectively, are required to explain both the LB's momentum and size and confirm that such a high supernova rate can be sustained by local star clusters. Our analysis yields a substantially smaller LB age than previous estimates, requiring a correspondingly larger number of SNe, driving its expansion. We show that this result is in tension with the conclusion that the LB is powered solely by SNe from the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association, which ceased star formation around the time the LB formed. If our estimates are correct, it follows that the majority of star formation in the solar neighborhood happened before the formation of the LB and was not triggered by its expansion. Instead, the SNe that powered the LB appear to overall have quenched the ongoing star formation process. This does not rule out that star formation in the clouds, located near its current edge, could have been affected by the LB expansion.",

The system offers a valuable opportunity to study how M-dwarf high-energy stellar radiation influences atmospheric stability and the potential for sustaining volatile species, especially important in the context of the upcoming ELT and its ANDES spectrograph. This study characterizes the high-energy environment of K2-18 with X-ray observations from eROSITA, the soft X-ray instrument on the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission, Chandra, and XMM-Newton. We derive a representative 0.2-2 keV X-ray flux with an APEC thermal plasma model fitted with the Bayesian X-ray Analysis (BXA). With the observed X-ray flux from the exoplanet host star, we estimate the photoevaporative mass loss of exoplanet K2-18b using the energy-limited model. In addition, we examine the thermal structure of the system based on a hydrodynamic model. In 100 ks XMM-Newton observation we identified K2-18 as a very faint X-ray source with $\\mathrm{F_X = 10^{-15}\\ erg\\,s^{-1}\\,cm^{-2}}$, with an activity level of (Lx/Lbol) $\\sim 10^{-5}$. A small flare has been detected during the observation. The planet is irradiated by an X-ray flux of $\\mathrm{F_{pl,X} = 12\\pm3\\ erg\\,s^{-1}\\,cm^{-2}}$. The X-ray flux measurement of K2-18 gives important limitations for atmospheric escape and photochemical modeling of its exoplanets.

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Many state-of-the-art galaxy simulations featuring traditional feedback modes have significant challenges producing enough extended soft X-ray ($\\sim 0.5-2$ keV) emission at R $\\sim 0.5-1$ R$_{\\rm vir}$ observed around galaxies with stellar masses M$_{\\rm \\ast} \\lesssim 10^{11} \\rm M_\\odot$, without violating galaxy mass function constraints. Moreover, thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) measurements probing the thermal pressure of similar galaxies indicate it is orders-of-magnitude lower than predictions from simple halo hydrodynamics and many hydrodynamical simulations. We demonstrate that these constraints can be met congruously with a large non-thermal pressure contribution in the form of cosmic rays (CRs) from SNe and/or AGN, which lowers the tSZ signal while CR leptons produce plentiful soft X-rays via inverse Compton scattering of the CMB. The combination of these two observations is far more constraining on the pressure budget of galactic halos than either alone -- if these novel tSZ and X-ray observations are borne out by future studies, then taken together they reveal \\textit{the strongest evidence for CR support in halos to date}. Conversely, it is very difficult to produce the extended X-rays via traditional thermal emission without increasing the overall thermal pressure and thus tSZ signal in tandem, making these tensions even worse. Finally, tSZ \\& X-rays together unlock a novel observational method to constrain halo CR pressure relative to thermal pressure, with implications for CR transport parameters and AGN feedback energetics across various galaxy mass scales. Taking the currently observed constraints at M$_{\\rm halo} \\sim 10^{\\rm 12} \\rm M_\\odot$ imply the halo CR pressure must at least be equal to the gas thermal pressure.",

Draine Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Resonant scattering of He I 1.0833$\\mu$m triplet photons by metastable He 2 $^3$S$_1$ is studied for optical depths characteristic of H II regions. Regions with large He 2 $^3$S$_1$ column densities are predicted to have unusually broad, multi-peaked 1.0833$\\mu$m emission profiles, with the centroid blue-shifted by up to $\\sim$14 km/s relative to other lines. The feature FWHM can exceed 100 km/s for some regions. Resonant trapping enhances dust absorption and reduces the He I 1.0833$\\mu$m emission. Care must be taken when using the He I 1.0833$\\mu$m/H I 1.0941$\\mu$m (Pa$\\gamma$) ratio to estimate the He$^+$/H$^+$ ratio. Predicted spectra are computed for examples, including M-17B and NGC3603 in the Galaxy, and a star-forming region in M51. Observations of the 1.0833$\\mu$m triplet with spectrometers such as NIRSPEC, CARMENES, or X-Shooter can confirm the predicted effects of resonant scattering in H II regions, and constrain the nebular conditions.",

Sand, Paul Bennet Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a catalog of 643 diffuse galaxies identified through a citizen science search of the Fornax cluster, of which we estimate 21.8% are nucleated (139/637; 6 inconclusive). This marks the first crowd-sourced effort to construct a cluster-scale census of diffuse galaxies. These objects were visually identified using a combination of the Fornax Deep Survey and Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey imaging across 26 deg$^2$. Over 1,400 volunteers cataloged the candidates within this sky area at a rate of 1.15 days/deg$^2$. Our catalog is highly complete relative to existing dwarf catalogs of Fornax ($> 80\\%$ of objects recovered) down to an effective radius $r_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 5^{\\prime \\prime}$, the minimum size we suggested volunteers classify, and to an effective r-band surface brightness as faint as $\\langle \\mu_r \\rangle \\simeq26$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$. We detect 97 candidates that existing automated searches of Fornax did not find and three candidates not found by any prior search, automated or visual. The stellar mass distribution of our sample is consistent with similar dwarf studies of Fornax, with the nucleated fraction peaking at 80% for a host galaxy mass of $\\sim$10$^{8.5}M_{\\odot}$. The efficiency and completeness of our catalog thus establishes citizen science as a valuable tool for mapping diffuse galaxy populations in future sky surveys, such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time.",

      "abstract": "The impact of attenuation on cosmic-ray chemistry: I. Abundances and chemical calibrators in molecular clouds Arghyadeb Roy, Brandt A. L. Gaches, Jonathan C. Tan Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The chemistry of shielded molecular gas is primarily driven by energetic, charged particles dubbed cosmic rays (CRs), in particular those with energies under 1 GeV. CRs ionize molecular hydrogen and helium, the latter of which contributes greatly to the destruction of molecules. CR ionization initiates a wide range of gas-phase chemistry, including pathways important for the so-called \"carbon cycle\", C$^+$/C/CO. Therefore, the CR ionization rate, $\\zeta$, is fundamental in theoretical and observational astrochemistry. Although observational methods show a wide range of ionization rates -- varying with the environment, especially decreasing into dense clouds -- astrochemical models often assume a constant rate. To address this limitation, we employ a post-processed gas-phase chemical model of a simulated dense molecular cloud that incorporates CR energy losses within the cloud. This approach allows us to investigate changes in abundance profiles of important chemical tracers and gas temperature. Furthermore, we analyze analytical calibrators for estimating $\\zeta$ in dense molecular gas that are robust when tested against a full chemical network. Additionally, we provide improved estimations of the electron fraction in dense gas for better consistency with observational data and theoretical calibrations for UV-shielded regions.",

Comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Observations of molecular structures on scales of $\\sim 0.1-50$ pc show that the specific angular momentum ($j$) scales with radius ($R$) as $j\\sim R^{3/2}$. We study the effects of turbulence, gravity, and the magnetic field in shaping this scaling, by measuring clump size and specific angular momentum in three SPH simulations of the formation of giant molecular clouds, progressively adding these three ingredients. In each simulation, we define ``full'' and ``reduced'' clump samples, the latter restricted to aspect ratios $A<3$. We find that, in the non-magnetic runs, elongated clumps deviate the most from the \\jR\\ relation, which is best reproduced by the reduced sample in the gravity+turbulence run. In the purely hydrodynamic case, no dense elongated structures form, suggesting that turbulence alone is insufficient to generate dense filaments, although clumps have $j$ magnitudes consistent with observations. In the gravity+turbulence+magnetic field run, most of the clumps are filamentary, yet the full sample appears to follow the observed \\jR\\ relation. This result, rather than being a real trend, could be the combination of the increase in $j$ by the filamentary geometry, and its reduction by turbulence inhibition by the magnetic field. Finally, we measure the gravitational, magnetic, pressure-gradient, and hydrodynamic torques (which involve turbulent viscosity) in our clump samples. We find that, in magnitude, the hydrodynamic torques tend to be larger than the rest. This result is consistent with our previous work, where we proposed that gravity drives cloud formation and contraction, while turbulence redistributes angular momentum through fluid-parcel exchanges.",

Ligori 24 pages; 11 figures in main text; 3 Appendices. Submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a detailed analysis of the old, extended stellar component of the Local Group dwarf galaxy IC 10 using deep resolved-star photometry in the VIS and NISP bands of the Euclid Early Release Observations. Leveraging Euclid's unique combination of wide field of view and high spatial resolution, we trace red giant branch (RGB) stars out to $\\sim$8 kpc from the galaxy centre, reaching azimuthally-averaged surface brightness levels as faint as $\\mu_{HE}\\sim$29 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. Our analysis reveals that IC 10's stellar distribution is significantly more extended than previously thought. After correcting for foreground extinction and subtracting contamination from Milky Way stars and background galaxies, we derive a radial stellar density profile from RGB star counts. The profile shows a marked flattening beyond $\\sim$5 kpc, and is best fit by a two-component (Sersic + exponential) model, yielding a total stellar mass in old (age $>$1 Gyr) stars of $M_{\\star}=(6.7-8.1)\\times10^8 M_{\\odot}$. The origin of the outer stellar component is unclear. It may be accreted, even possibly associated with the counter-rotating HI gas in the outer regions of IC 10, or it may represent an ancient in-situ stellar halo. We tentatively detect two symmetric stellar overdensities at the edge of our imagery. These roughly align with the direction of IC 10's orbit around M31, suggesting that they may be signatures of tidal stripping. As part of our analysis, we derive a new distance to IC 10 based on the RGB tip, finding $D=762\\pm 20$ kpc and the distance modulus is $(m-M)_0=24.41\\pm 0.05$.",

We report the following: (1) Low stellar mass galaxies ($M_{\\rm star} < 10^{9.5}\\, M_\\odot$) are strongly DM dominated across all radii, with average $\\langle f_{_{\\rm DM}} \\rangle \\sim 0.85$, while high-mass ($M_{\\rm star} > 10^{10.5}\\, M_\\odot$) systems exhibit relatively low DM fractions in their inner regions ($\\langle f_{_{\\rm DM}} \\rangle \\sim 0.47$) which is equivalent to local massive disk galaxies (e.g., Milky Way and Andromeda). This suggests a mass-dependent structural dichotomy, most-likely governed by a combination of internal galactic processes and environmental influences. (2) A tight inverse correlation between $f_{_{\\rm DM}}$ and baryon mass surface density ($\\Sigma_{\\rm bar}$), with intrinsic scatter of $\\sim 0.11$ dex. This is consistent with an inside-out baryon assembly scenario and suggests that the fundamental structural correlations of galaxies were already established by $z\\sim 0.85$. (3) No significant evolution in $f_{_{\\rm DM}}$ with redshift across the MAGPI window, and when combined with higher-redshift ($0.6 \\leq z \\leq 1.5$) data from Sharma et al. 2025, we quantitatively show that the reported decline in $f_{_{\\rm DM}}(z)$ is most-likely due to observational biases against low-mass systems at $z > 1$. These results offer empirical evidence for a scenario in which disk-like galaxies evolve through a co-regulated build-up of baryonic and DM components, preserving internal structural regularities (such as the total mass distribution and rotation-curve shape) throughout cosmic time.",

Oosterloo, Filippo Fraternali, Kelley M. Hess, Jin-Long Xu, Ming Zhu 8 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Dark galaxies - systems rich in neutral hydrogen (HI) gas but with no stars - are a common prediction of numerous theoretical models and cosmological simulations. However, the unequivocal identification of such sources in current HI surveys has proven challenging. In this work, we present interferometric follow-up observations with the VLA of a former dark galaxy candidate J0139+4328, originally detected with the single-dish FAST telescope. The improved spatial resolution of the VLA data allow us to identify a faint optical counterpart and characterize the galaxy. Located at a distance of about 31 Mpc, J0139+4328 has a stellar mass of 3 x 10^6 M_Sun and a relatively high gas richness of M_HI/M_star = 18. Despite its high ratio, the galaxy is consistent, within the scatter, with the stellar-to-HI mass relation of HI-selected samples in the literature and with the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR), although its kinematic measurement is subject to large uncertainties. This case highlights the potential of modern high-sensitivity HI surveys for detecting low surface brightness, gas-rich galaxies, but underscores the need for careful interpretation of low-resolution HI data, with potentially large centroid errors, and for sufficiently deep optical imaging to ensure robust identification.",

ALMA CO $J$=3--2 data reveal eight ``Petit--Bullets'' surrounding the previously known ``Bullet.'' Each Petit--Bullet shows a distinct V-shaped structure in position--velocity space, reminiscent of the Y-shaped morphology of the Bullet, suggesting a common origin. These features are interpreted as the result of high-velocity plunges of compact gravitational objects into dense molecular gas. The spatial and kinematic properties of the Petit--Bullets suggest that the plunging material was not a single object but rather a small cluster of compact bodies. A virial mass of $1.0\\!\\times\\! 10^{5}\\, M_\\odot$ inferred from their velocity dispersion is comparable to that of typical globular clusters. Momentum analysis further implies that the main Bullet likely formed by an isolated black hole. These findings provide new evidence for dynamical interactions between halo clusters and disk molecular gas.",

Accurate determination of BHB merger timescales is essential for interpreting GWBs and constraining key astrophysical quantities such as black hole (BH) occupation fractions and galaxy coalescence rates. High-accuracy $N$-body codes such as \\texttt{Griffin} can resolve sub-pc BHB dynamics but are too costly to explore a wide range of initial conditions, motivating the need for surrogate models that emulate their long-term evolution at much lower computational cost. We investigate neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) as surrogates for the secular orbital evolution of BHBs. Our primary contribution is a parameterised NODE (PNODE) trained on an ensemble of $N$-body simulations of galaxy mergers spanning a two-dimensional parameter space defined by the initial orbital eccentricity and particle resolution $(e_i, N)$, with the learned vector field explicitly conditioned on these parameters. A single PNODE thereby learns a simulation-parameter-conditioned dynamical model for the coupled evolution of the BH pair's orbital state across the ensemble, yielding smooth trajectories from which stable hardening and eccentricity growth rates can be extracted. The PNODE accurately reproduces the secular evolution of the specific orbital energy and angular momentum, and the corresponding Keplerian orbital elements, for held-out trajectories, with modest generalisation to a partially unseen high-resolution case. Combining PNODE predictions with semi-analytical prescriptions for stellar hardening and gravitational-wave emission yields BHB merger timescales consistent with those obtained from direct $N$-body inputs within current theoretical uncertainties.",

Comments are welcome. 14 pages, 16 plot Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Context. In the Local Group, dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) exhibit large velocity dispersions. These values are generally attributed to the presence of substantial amounts of dark matter (DM), in line with the predictions of the standard model of galaxy formation. However, alternative, more conservative explanations exist, such as non-virialized dynamical states induced by tidal interactions, the presence of stellar streams, and artificial inflation of the velocity dispersion caused by binary-star orbital motion. Aims. We study the dynamical evolution of UFDs using purely stellar (\"dry\") dynamics, without invoking DM. We dynamically evolve our systems up to a Hubble time and compare our results with observational studies and previous theoretical work. Methods. We employ direct high precision NBODY simulations performed with the NBODY6++GPU code. We explore the role of binaries in inflating the velocity dispersion of low-mass host galaxies. We also present both the stellar and dynamical evolution of the stellar population, which is necessary to properly interpret our results. Results. We find that, in all our models, the UFD remains globally quasi-stationary for approximately 3000 Myr. Subsequently, the system undergoes mass segregation and experiences a phase resembling core collapse. Red giants and white dwarfs (WD) are found to play significant, but distinct, roles. Red giants provide the dominant contribution to the luminosity, whereas WDs constitute the largest fraction of the non-luminous component, accounting for approximately 13% of the total stellar population. Finally, if not taken into account properly, velocity dispersion measurements can be strongly biased by the presence of a significant binary population, which can lead to substantial overestimates of velocity dispersion in UFDs",

We use measurements from the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) Large Program ALCHEMI: the ALMA Comprehensive High-resolution Molecular Inventory. Using different subsets of the eight total HCN and HNC transitions measured by ALCHEMI, we test the number and combinations of transitions necessary for constraining the temperature, H$_2$ volume and column densities, cosmic-ray ionization rate, and beam-filling factor in three representative regions within NGC 253. We use these combinations of HCN and HNC transitions to constrain chemical and radiative transfer models and infer the gas conditions using a Bayesian nested sampling algorithm combined with neural network models for increased efficiency. By comparing the shapes of the resulting posterior distributions, as well as the medians and uncertainties for each gas parameter, from each test case to what we obtain with the full set of eight transitions (the control), we quantify how well each test reproduces the control. We find that multiple transitions each of both molecules are required to obtain a median parameter value within a factor of 2 of the control with an uncertainty less than 2-3 times that of the control. We also find that transition combinations that feature a range of upper-state energies are most effective. We show that single transitions, such as HCN J = 1-0 or 3-2, are among the worst-performing combinations and result in parameter values up to an order of magnitude different than the control.",

Zarattini 14 pages, 10 figure, accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The matter distribution in the Universe exhibits a rich variety of structures forming the cosmic web. These structures arise from the anisotropic gravitational collapse of primordial density fluctuations and define the pathways along which galaxies flow from voids to high-density clusters. Local density variations within these structures play a fundamental role in driving the environmental evolution of galaxies. To characterise filament boundaries, we analysed galaxy overdensity profiles around filaments in two redshift ranges: $0.05 < z < 0.1$ and $0.1 < z < 0.3$. Perpendicular and parallel profiles were derived by averaging galaxy overdensity as a function of distance. Characteristic scales and central overdensities were then analysed by fitting analytical models, specifically exponential and power-law families. We also introduced normalised density profiles to account for survey incompleteness. The perpendicular overdensity profiles show a nearly constant value in the central regions $D_{fila} < 1$ Mpc, decreasing at distances up to $\\approx 10$ Mpc. The mean physical widths (scale radii) at $0.05 < z < 0.1$ and $0.1 < z < 0.3$ are $2.39 \\pm 0.69$ and $5.56 \\pm 2.29$ Mpc, respectively. This scale difference between redshift ranges is also evident in the normalised profiles. Conversely, profiles along filaments remain constant at distances larger than $\\approx 20$ Mpc from the nearest intersection. Our results show that the influence zone of cosmic filaments extends up to $\\sim 10$ Mpc from their spines. Furthermore, a mild evolution in structural parameters is observed over the past $\\sim 4$ Gyr, suggesting that filaments undergo measurable changes even at relatively low redshifts.",

Espinoza-Galeas Accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We analyse a sample of 225 star-forming regions from the DESIRED-E project, each with simultaneous determinations of the electron temperature from ionized nitrogen and oxygen, $T_{\\rm e}$([NII]) and $T_{\\rm e}$([OIII]), respectively. We derive new empirical relations connecting the gas-phase metallicity to the global electron temperature, $T_{\\rm e}$(H$^+$), as determined via radio observations. We establish two calibrations: one assuming a homogeneous temperature distribution ($t^2 = 0$, the ``direct method''), and another accounting for internal temperature fluctuations ($t^2 > 0$). Applying these calibrations to 460 radio observations of Galactic HII~regions spanning Galactocentric distances from $\\sim0.1$ to 16 kpc, we determine the radial O/H gradient in the Milky Way under both assumptions. We further compare these nebular gradients to independent metallicity estimates from young O- and B-type stars and Cepheid variables. We find that the $t^2 > 0$ calibration yields a gradient in excellent agreement with stellar-based determinations, whereas the $t^2 = 0$ method underestimates metallicities by up to $\\sim$0.3 dex. This discrepancy cannot be reconciled by invoking oxygen depletion onto dust grains or nucleosynthetic processing via the CNO cycle in massive stars. We also find that one widely used relation in the literature, assuming $t^2 = 0$, produces an excessively steep gradient -- likely due to the use of outdated atomic data and pre-CCD observations. Finally, we explore potential azimuthal variations in the Galactic metallicity distribution driven by the presence of the spiral arms, finding no evidence for variations larger than $\\sim$0.1 dex with respect to the general radial gradient.",

We find that the environment affects type~2 AGN and non-AGN galaxies in similar ways and does not impact the strength of AGN-driven outflows. The f$_{gas}$ of type~2 AGN and non-AGN host galaxies show no variation between group and isolated environments, suggesting that host galaxy gas content is largely independent of large-scale environment. We find that type~2 AGN host galaxies possess systematically lower f$_{gas}$ than their non-AGN counterparts when matched in stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR). This suggests that AGN activity plays a significant role in regulating the molecular gas reservoir and, consequently, the star formation processes within galaxies. We find that Type~2 AGNs exhibiting strong outflows are associated with higher gas fractions, higher star-formation rates, and younger stellar populations than those with weak or no outflows. This may indicate either concurrent star formation in gas-rich systems hosting powerful outflows, or a time delay between AGN activity and its effect on star formation consistent with a delayed AGN feedback scenario.",

Using two high-resolution Hestia runs, we examine the distribution and velocities of H I, C IV, Si III, O VI, O VII, and O VIII and their imprints on sightlines observed from the Sun's location in different reference frames. To mimic observational strategies, we assess the contribution of rotating disc gas, assuming simple kinematic and geometrical considerations. Our results indicate that local absorption features in observed sightlines most likely trace material in the circumgalactic medium of the Milky Way. Some sightlines, however, show that intragroup material could be more easily observed towards the barycentre, which defines a preferred direction in the sky. In particular, H I, Si III, and C IV roughly trace cold gas inside the Milky Way and Andromeda haloes, as most of their mass flux occurs within the virial region of each galaxy, while oxygen high ions mostly trace hot halo and intragroup gas, with comparable mass fluxes in the Local Group outskirts and the circumgalactic medium of the two main galaxies. Additionally, we find that pressures traced by different ionic species outside the Milky Way halo show systematically higher values towards the barycentre direction in contrast to its antipode in the sky. Kinematic imprints of the global motion towards the barycentre can be seen at larger distances for all ionic species as the Milky Way rams into material in the direction of Andromeda, with gas towards the anti-barycentre lagging behind.",

Cernicharo Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We report the detection of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) 1H-cyclopent[cd]indene (c-C11H8) in TMC-1 with the QUI- JOTE line survey. We detected 22 independent lines corresponding to 88 rotational transitions with quantum numbers ranging from J=19 up to J=24 and Ka <= 5 in the Q-band range. The identification of this new PAH was based on the agreement between the rotational parameters derived from the analysis of the lines and those obtained by quantum chemical calculations. The column density derived for 1H-cyclopent[cd]indene is (6.0 +- 0.5) x 10^12 cm-2, with a rotational temperature of 9 K. Its abundance is high, as is that of the rest of the PAHs, but it is the lowest of all those detected to date in TMC-1, being 2.66 times less abundant than indene and 4.66 times less than phenalene. This result will help us to better understand the growth of five- and six-membered rings in dark clouds. Chemical models explaining their formation through the bottom-up model are still very incomplete and require further experimental and theoretical effort. Even so, the most likely formation reactions would occur between the smallest rings with small hydrocarbons; the most probable reaction for the formation of cyclopentindene is that between indene and C2H, C2H3, and/or their cation.",

Bernal Mesina Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics (A&A) journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Magnetic fields and turbulence may play a key role in the evolution of protoclusters, influencing the formation of dense cores and stars. Here, we examine the morphology of the magnetic fields in the G327.29 protocluster using both the velocity gradient technique (VGT) extracted from molecular line emissions and linear polarization in the dust continuum emission. The VGT analysis is performed using four molecular tracers: DCN (3-2), C18O (2-1), HN13C (3-2), and H13CO+ (3-2) - which probe gas across different density regimes, observed with the ALMA 12 m array. Owing to its sensitivity to gas dynamics, a comparison between VGT and dust polarization provides a powerful probe of the evolutionary processes in massive star-forming regions. From our analysis we reveal a complex magnetic-field structure, shaped by the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. In addition, it also appears that there is a large-scale (beyond the core scale) gravitational infall from the surrounding medium on to the filament and the central densest region. Furthermore, we observe that cores are dominated by a mix of turbulence and gravity. Overall, this work presents, likely for the first time, the application of VGT to a massive protocluster, G327.29, using high-resolution ALMA observations.",

Megías, I. Jiménez-Serra, A. Taillard Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Deuterium fractionation becomes highly efficient in cold, dense cores where CO is frozen out. Cyclopropenylidene (c-C3H2), an early-formed carbon ring, and its deuterated isotopologues trace gas-phase deuteration in these environments. We present a statistical study of c-C3H2 deuteration in starless and prestellar cores of the Perseus Molecular Cloud using observations of c-C3H2, c-C3HD and c-C3D2 obtained with the Yebes 40 m, ARO 12 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes towards 16 cores. Gaussian fits and RADEX modeling yield column densities for the detected species. c-C3H2 is detected in 14/15 covered cores, c-C3HD in 15/16, and c-C3D2 in 9/16. Derived column densities range from 0.5-8.1 x 10^{13} cm^{-2} for c-C3H2, 0.2-2.1 x 10^{12} cm^{-2} for c-C3HD, and 0.6-1.6 x 10^{11} cm^{-2} for c-C3D2. The ortho-to-para ratio of c-C3H2 is obtained for all but one core, with a median value of 3.5\\pm0.4. Statistically corrected D/H ratios span 0.5-9.2% (median 1.5\\pm0.2%), and D2/D ratios 9-55% (median 25.9\\pm4.3%). No trend is found between the c-C3H2 ortho-to-para ratio and core evolutionary stage traced by n(H2). The median D/H ratio in Perseus appears lower than values reported for Taurus and Chamaeleon, while the D2/D ratio agrees with Taurus within uncertainties. A positive correlation between D/H and n(H2) supports the use of D/H as an evolutionary tracer. D2/D does not correlate with n(H2), but shows a positive correlation with T_{kin}, suggesting that its formation is influenced by a mildly endothermic pathway.",

Our results show that G24 is an $\\sim$80 pc giant filament with a total mass of $\\sim$$10^5$ M$_{\\odot}$. In the different tracers the filament width is measured to be about $\\sim$2 times the beam size of the observations, as expected for power-law density distributions, giving beam-deconvolved widths in the range from 0.8 to 2.8 pc. We determine a line-of-sight thickness of $\\sim$2.2 pc demonstrating that G24 is not an edge-on, flatten structure. The virial parameter obtained from line mass ($\\alpha_{\\rm line,vir}=M_{\\rm line,vir}/M_{\\rm line}$) from the $\\rm C^{18}O$ (1-0) data is 0.85, and that obtained from $Herschel$-based H$_2$ column density is 0.52, suggesting G24 is globally close to virial equilibrium. The distribution of the 40 dust clumps appears to have a ''two-tier'' fragmentation pattern. For the clump groups, the separation, with a mean/median of 3.68/3.46 pc, is very close to expected length associated with the maximum fragmentation growth rate of $\\lambda_{\\rm max}=3.55 \\pm0.32$ pc estimated for the dust. However, the longitudinal centroid velocity profiles of $\\rm C^{18}O$ and $\\rm N_2H^+$ show oscillation patterns with wavelengths of 9.8$\\pm$0.1 pc and 9.9$\\pm$0.1 pc, respectively. This is $\\sim$2 times larger than the corresponding values of $\\lambda_{\\rm max}$ of 4.96$\\pm$0.63 pc and 4.65$\\pm$1.34 pc, respectively. This suggests that the velocity structure is not dominated by flows directly associated with the fragmentation seen in the dust emission.",

By simulating and taking account of point-source emission from the active galactic nucleus (AGN), we detect iron-line emission $\\sim$ 20--60 pc away from the nucleus, particularly in the eastern and western regions. In the two regions, possible time variability in the line flux was also detected. Our spectral analysis then finds that the observed equivalent widths can reach $\\sim$ 2 keV and the slopes of underlying continua are rather inverted with $\\Gamma < 0$. These are consistent with a scenario in which the iron emission originates from clouds illuminated by AGN X-rays; our result could provide the first extragalactic example of AGN X-ray echoes. In this scenario, we estimated the physical sizes of the illuminated clouds based on the timescale of variability to be less than 6 pc. Furthermore, we compared the iron emission distribution with the cold molecular distribution inferred by Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observation of CO($J$=3--2), revealing that in the region of bright iron-line emission, the molecular emission seems to be weak. This might suggest that the AGN X-ray emission affects the chemical composition in the form of AGN feedback.",

Allison, Marcin Słowacki, Minfeng Gu, Vanessa Moss, Yongjun Chen, Zhongzu Wu, Zheng Zheng 7 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) observations of 0731+438, an \\mbox{FR II} radio galaxy at a redshift of 2.429 with two lobes separated by 82 kpc. A blueshifted, faint and broad \\mbox{H{\\sc i}} 21 cm absorption line with velocity full width at half maximum (FWHM) $\\sim 600\\,\\rm km\\,s^{-1}$ is detected against the southern radio lobe that is 47 kpc from radio core, indicating a neutral hydrogen outflow associated with jet-gas interaction beyond the host galaxy. The outflow has a mass outflow rate of $\\sim\\,0.4T_{\\rm s}\\Omega\\rm\\, M_\\odot\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$, which could increase to $\\sim\\,4.0T_{\\rm s}\\Omega\\rm\\,M_\\odot\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$, corresponding to an energy outflow rate of $2.4T_{\\rm s}\\Omega\\times10^{40}$ -- $1.5T_{\\rm s}\\Omega\\times10^{41}\\,\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}$, where $T_{\\rm s}$ is the spin temperature and $\\Omega$ is the solid angle of the outflow.

We propose that both the extended emission line region and the optical outflow are results of synergistic effect between jet and AGN radiation. The AGN likely exerts negative feedback on the host galaxy, as evidenced by the gas expulsion by the jet and the high velocity dispersion of ionized gas observed optically. So far, detections of jet-driven neutral hydrogen outflows remain rare. The high redshift, large outflow radii, substantial mass outflow rate and energy outflow rate of the neutral hydrogen outflow in 0731+438 expand the known parameter space of such outflows.",

Fujii 15 pages, 16 figures, 6 tables, submitted to PASJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Dwarf galaxies have a wide variety of structures, such as dark matter (DM) distribution, stellar-to-halo mass ratio, and stellar density. Recent high-resolution simulations have shown a variety of stellar-to-halo mass ratios for dwarf galaxies with a DM halo mass of $\\sim 10^9 M_{\\odot}$ at $z=0$. In this study, we performed cosmological $N$-body/smoothed-particle hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of dwarf galaxies with the highest gas and DM particle mass resolutions of 2.37 $M_{\\odot}$ and 12.8 $M_{\\odot}$, respectively. The stellar-to-DM halo mass ratio of one of our simulated dwarf galaxies was $\\sim 10^{-4}$, typical for satellites of the Milky Way. The stellar mass ($10^5 M_{\\odot}$) and half-mass radius (68 pc) were also similar to those of the satellites of the Milky Way. The power-law slope of the DM halo was $\\alpha = -1.1$. On the other hand, the other simulated galaxy exhibited a stellar-to-halo mass ratio of $\\sim 10^{-3}$ and a steeper power-law slope ($\\alpha=-1.9$) than the other; the presence of baryonic matter deepened the cusp. The mass of $>10^6 M_{\\odot}$ and a half-mass radius of $\\sim 36$ pc of this galaxy were similar to those of ultra-compact dwarf galaxies rather than the satellites of the Milky Way. This DM halo grew in mass earlier than the former one, and the central DM density was higher than that of the other even in the DM-only simulations.",

We update an analytical cusp-core transition model by incorporating the effect of supernova-driven mass loss. Adapting this model to SPARC galaxies, we measure the energy conversion efficiency epsilon, defined as the fraction of supernova feedback energy that is used to change the central dark-matter potential. We find epsilon ~ 0.01 for nearby SPARC galaxies. Building on these measurements, we compare the dynamical energy required for a cusp-core transformation with the feedback energy available over burst cycles and identify a cusp-core transition forbidden region on the halo-stellar mass plane where transformation cannot occur. Galaxies with halo masses from 10^8 to 10^11 M_sun lie outside the forbidden region, whereas ultra-faint dwarf galaxies < 10^8 M_sun, galaxy groups and clusters > 10^11 M_sun fall within it, consistent with their high central densities and the inefficiency of core formation at very low and very high masses. This approach also explains the observed diversity of inner density profiles in low-mass systems, showing that both the star formation rate and the energy conversion efficiency govern them, with the latter emerging as a key parameter setting the strength of the cusp-core transition. Beyond the cusp-core problem, our observationally inferred energy conversion efficiency provides a model independent benchmark that strongly constrains galaxy formation models.",

For each real and simulated galaxy, we obtained a suitable photometric model in which the B/PS bulge was represented by a dedicated 2D photometric function. For real galaxies, we found that more flattened X-structures are generally residing in larger B/PS bulges. When tested against the galaxy masses, we verified that both larger bulges and more flattened X-structures are typically found in more massive galaxies. Since large bars are also known to reside in more massive galaxies, we conclude that the flatness of X-structures in larger B/PS bulges has a physical origin, rather than being solely a result of projection effects due to differences in observed bar viewing angles. When comparing the properties of B/PS bulges between EGIPS galaxies and TNG50 galaxies, with bars rotated for different viewing angles, we found that B/PS bulges in TNG50 are considerably smaller and less luminous in terms of total intensity. This is consistent with previous studies of bar properties in TNG50, indicating the B/PS bulges in TNG50 differ from those in real galaxies, as do their parent bars.",

As giant radio galaxies (GRGs) often extend to the scale of entire galaxy clusters ($\\sim$Mpc) and beyond, they are a suitable class of objects for studying jet--intracluster medium interactions. This paper presents a multiwavelength study of a GRG, J1007+3540, using the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey second data release (LoTSS DR2) at 144 MHz and the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at 400 MHz. The source has a projected linear extension of 1.45 Mpc and is hosted by MaxBCG J151.77665+35.67813, within the WHL 100706.4+354041 cluster. At both frequencies, the source exhibits clear signatures of recurrent jet activity, a one-sided, extended, tail-like diffuse structure with a morphological break in the tail. The estimated radiative ages of the inner lobes and outer north lobe are $\\sim$140 Myr and $\\sim$240 Myr, respectively. In addition to the radio analysis, we performed optical--to--infrared spectral energy distribution modelling. The host galaxy is an evolved elliptical system with a stellar mass of $\\log_{10}(M_\\star/M_\\odot) = 11.0$ and an old stellar population age of $\\sim$12 Gyr. The high infrared-derived star formation rate ($\\sim106~M_\\odot$~yr$^{-1}$) of the source implies significant dust-obscured star formation, potentially linked to merger-driven gas inflows. J1007+3540 presents a rare combination of a restarted jet, a detached tail-like structure, and unusual spectral flattening beyond the tail break, which is very rare to report together in a GRG. This rare and remarkable system offers a unique laboratory for probing the interplay between active galactic nucleus activity, star formation, and environmental effects in cluster-surrounded GRGs.",

We present new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data of one such system, the dwarf galaxy Canes Venatici C (CVn C). CVn C is a low-mass (3.4(+4.2-2.6)*10^6 M_sun) galaxy with a Tip of the Red Giant Branch distance of 8.43(+0.47-0.32) Mpc determined from the resolved stars in the HST imaging, which we also use to derive CVn C's structural parameters. CVn C's distance places CVn C in the Local Volume and in an isolated environment with the most tidally influential L* galaxy > 5Rvir away. Additional constraints from the HST color-magnitude diagram, archival Far-Ultraviolet (FUV), and neutral hydrogen (HI) data show that CVn C is quenched, with no evidence of star formation in the last 100 Myr and no detectable gas (MHI < 1.5*10^6 M_sun). Circumstantial evidence suggests that CVn C may have quenched via past interactions with the L* galaxy NGC 4631 (L_K = 10^10.4 L_sun), and was possibly sent on an extreme backsplash orbit by the tidal dissolution of a subhalo group. However, other quenching mechanisms-such as stripping via the cosmic web-cannot be ruled out. CVn C adds to the growing number of quenched dwarf galaxies in under-dense environments, a population that will be critical to defining the mass and environment regimes in which different quenching mechanisms operate.",

Zawadzki 21 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables, published in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) CO gas is detected in a significant number of debris discs, but its origin and evolution remains unclear. Key constraints are its mass and spectro-spatial distribution, which are coupled through optical depth and have only been analysed at low to moderate resolution so far. The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) is the first ALMA large program to target debris discs at high spectro-spatial resolution. We used $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO J=3-2 line data of 18 ARKS debris belts, 5 of which were already known to host gas, to analyse the spectro-spatial distribution of CO, constrain the gas masses, and to search for gas in the remaining systems. We developed a line-imaging pipeline and produced line cubes for each disc, with a spatial resolution down to $\\sim$70 mas and spectral resolution of 26 m s$^{-1}$. Using spectro-spatial shifting and stacking, we produced high signal-to-noise maps, and radial and spectral profiles that reveal the distribution and kinematics of gas in 5 gas-bearing discs. For these discs, we constrained the inner radius of the $^{12}$CO, and found the radial brightness profile of CO peaked interior to the dust ring, but that CO was more radially extended than the dust. We present the first radially resolved $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO isotopologue flux ratios in gas-bearing debris discs, which are constant with radius for the majority of systems, indicating $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO are both optically thick or thin throughout the discs. We report CO line fluxes/upper limits for all systems and optical depth dependant masses for the 5 gas-bearing systems. Finally, we analysed the $^{12}$CO J=3-2 line luminosities for the ARKS debris discs and discs from the literature. We confirm that gas is mostly detected in young systems. However, the high scatter seen in young/high fractional luminosity systems indicates no trend within the systems with detected gas.",

Accepted by the Astronomical Journal Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Herbig Ae/Be stars (HAeBes) are critical tracers of intermediate- and high-mass star formation, yet their census remains incomplete compared to low-mass young stellar objects like T-Tauri stars. To expand the known population, we systematically searched for HAeBes in LAMOST DR7 low-resolution spectra. Following Sun et al., we applied Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, identifying $\\sim$240,000 spectra with potential H$\\alpha$ emission. After removing contaminants (non-stellar objects, extragalactic sources, CVs, and Algol systems) and restricting to B/A-type stars, we obtained 1,835 candidates through 2MASS/WISE visual inspection. Spectral energy distribution analysis confirmed 143 sources with infrared excess ($J$-band or longer wavelengths), including 92 known HAeBes. From the remaining 51 candidates, we classified 26 with strong infrared excess as new HAeBes. Color-index analysis of confirmed HAeBes and classical Ae/Be stars (CAeBes) revealed that the $(K-W1)_0$ vs. $(W2-W3)_0$ diagram effectively separates these populations: CAeBes predominantly occupy $(K-W1)_0 \\leq 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 \\leq 1.1$, while other regions trace transition disks ($(K-W1)_0 < 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 > 1.1$), globally depleted disks ($(K-W1)_0 > 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 < 1.1$), and Class I/Flat/II HAeBes ($(K-W1)_0 > 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 > 1.1$). More importantly, the HAeBes exhibit a clear evolutionary gradient on this diagram, with those in the Class III, Class II, Flat-SED, and Class I evolutionary stages being effectively distinguished by concentric ellipses that are roughly centered at (0,0) with semi-major axes of $a$=1.5, $a$=3.0, and $a$=4.0, and a semi-major to semi-minor axis ratio of 1.6:1.",

In this Letter, we investigate collective excitations in Bose gases under Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). We derive an anisotropic excitation spectrum in the MOND regime. This anisotropy arises directly from the intrinsic nonlinear structure of the MOND Poisson equation, forming a distinctive signature of the modified gravitational response. We then analyze the Jeans instability, obtaining analytic expressions for the direction-dependent critical wavelength and mass. These results advance our understanding of collective behavior in quantum systems under modified dynamics and establish clear theoretical signatures for testing MOND-like effects in quantum simulators.",

However, Dome A, Antarctica has exceptionally dry conditions that offer a unique opportunity for observations in this band. We designed a new filter covering 1.34--1.48 $\\mu$m, namely $W'$, and installed it on the Antarctic Infrared Binocular Telescope (AIRBT) at Dome A in 2025. AIRBT comprises two identical 15 cm optical tube assemblies and two InGaAs cameras equipped with $J$ and $W'$ filters, respectively. With this Early Data Release (EDR), we aim to evaluate the performance of the $W'$ band at Dome A to observe objects with water-vapor features. This EDR covers $\\thicksim 20 \\ \\mathrm{deg^2}$ in the Galactic plane using $\\thicksim 20,000$ images in three nights. For 2 s exposures, the 5 $\\sigma$ limiting magnitude histogram peaks at $J \\thicksim 11.5$ mag (Vega) and $W' \\thicksim 9.9$ mag, respectively. The $J-W'$ vs $J-H$ color-color diagram distinguishes ultracool candidates with water-vapor-absorption features from reddened early type stars. Furthermore, later-type stars tend to exhibit stronger water-vapor absorption. Some sources show larger $\\Delta W'$ than $\\Delta J$ across the three nights, which we attribute to variations of their water-vapor-absorption depth. We conclude that it will be efficient to search for ultracool stars and estimate their spectral subtypes using $W'$ band imaging at Dome A, where the atmospheric transmission is high and stable.",

Terry, Andrew Gould Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The microlensing event OGLE-2011-BLG-0950 exhibits the well-known ``Planet/Binary'' degeneracy, in which distinct lens configurations produce similar light curves but imply substantially different mass ratios between the lens components. A previous study suggested that high-resolution imaging could break this degeneracy through differences in the lens-source relative proper motion. In this work, we identify a new planetary model for this event that arises from a newly identified degeneracy, simultaneously reproducing the observed light curve and remaining consistent with the relative proper motion measured from high-resolution imaging. By combining constraints from the light-curve modeling and high-resolution observations, we infer a lens system consisting of a $\\sim 1~M_{\\odot}$ host star orbited by a $\\sim 1.5~M_{\\rm Jup}$ planet, with a projected separation of about 2 or 8 au, subject to the ``Close/Wide'' degeneracy. Our reanalysis of the color-magnitude diagram further indicates that the source star has unresolved companions that contribute non-negligible blended light, highlighting the importance of carefully accounting for source and lens companions in future Roman microlensing analyses. Finally, we show that adopting a single mass--luminosity relation significantly underestimates the uncertainties in the inferred lens properties for host masses $\\gtrsim 1~M_{\\odot}$.",

Pogge Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present the analysis of four microlensing events, KMT-2020-BLG-0202, KMT-2022-BLG-1551, KMT-2023-BLG-0466, and KMT-2025-BLG-0121, which exhibit extended and complex anomalies in their light curves. These events were identified through a systematic reanalysis of KMTNet data aimed at detecting planetary signals that deviate from the typical short-term anomaly morphology. Detailed modeling indicates that all four anomalies were produced by planetary companions to low-mass stellar hosts. The events have mass ratios of $q \\sim (5$--$14)\\times10^{-3}$ and Einstein timescales of $t_{\\rm E} \\sim 20$--$43$ days. Bayesian analyses based on Galactic models show that the companions are super-Jupiters with masses of a few to approximately 10 $M_{\\rm J}$, orbiting sub-solar-mass hosts located at distances of $D_{\\rm L} \\sim 4$--$7$~kpc. All planets lie well beyond the snow line of their hosts, placing them in the regime of cold giant planets. These detections demonstrate that extended and complex microlensing anomalies, which are often challenging to recognize as planetary in origin, can nonetheless contain planetary signals. This work underscores the unique sensitivity of microlensing to cold, massive planets beyond the snow line and highlights the importance of systematic reanalyses of survey data for achieving a more complete and unbiased census of exoplanets in the Galaxy.",

Using VLT-KMOS, we detect Br$\\gamma$ emission in 5 of the 26 targets, which also exhibit 3.3-cm continuum emission in VLA images, consistent with partially ionised jets. For seven additional sources, stringent flux upper limits were obtained. The derived accretion and ionised mass-loss rates for class I and class II YSOs follow a sublinear correlation $\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{ion}} \\propto \\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{acc}}^{0.3}$, consistent with previous results for class II YSOs but extended here to earlier stages. Multi-epoch observations reveal modest variability in both tracers but no clear temporal correlation between accretion and ejection within timescales of a few months. The ratio $\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{ion}}/\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{acc}}$ shows an anti-correlation with $\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{acc}}$, increasing with time from class I YSOs to class II YSOs, suggesting an increase in jet-launching efficiency or ionisation fraction with evolution.

Willmer, Chris Willott, Joris Witstok 29 pages, 19 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present the UV-to-NIR size evolution of a sample of 161 quiescent galaxies (QGs) with $M_*>10^{10}M_\\odot$ over $0.5<z<5$. With deep multi-band NIRCam images in GOODS-South from JADES, we measure the effective radii ($R_e$) of the galaxies at rest-frame 0.3, 0.5 and 1$\\mu m$. On average, QGs are 45% (15%) more compact at rest-frame 1$\\mu m$ than they are at 0.3$\\mu m$ (0.5$\\mu m$). Regardless of wavelengths, the $R_e$ of QGs strongly evolves with redshift, and this evolution depends on stellar mass. For lower-mass QGs with $M_*=10^{10}-10^{10.6}M_\\odot$, the evolution follows $R_e\\sim(1+z)^{-1.1}$, whereas it becomes steeper, following $R_e\\sim(1+z)^{-1.7}$, for higher-mass QGs with $M_*>10^{10.6}M_\\odot$. To constrain the physical mechanisms driving the apparent size evolution, we study the relationship between $R_e$ and the formation redshift ($z_{form}$) of QGs. For lower-mass QGs, this relationship is broadly consistent with $R_e\\sim(1+z_{form})^{-1}$, in line with the expectation of the progenitor effect. For higher-mass QGs, the relationship between $R_e$ and $z_{form}$ depends on stellar age. Older QGs have a steeper relationship between $R_e$ and $z_{form}$ than that expected from the progenitor effect alone, suggesting that mergers and/or post-quenching continuous gas accretion drive additional size growth in very massive systems. We find that the $z>3$ QGs in our sample are very compact, with mass surface densities $\\Sigma_e\\gtrsim10^{10} M_\\odot/\\rm{kpc}^2$, and their $R_e$ are possibly even smaller than anticipated from the size evolution measured for lower-redshift QGs. Finally, we take a close look at the structure of GS-9209, one of the earliest confirmed massive QGs at $z_{spec}\\sim4.7$. From UV to NIR, GS-9209 becomes increasingly compact, and its light profile becomes more spheroidal, showing that the color gradient is already present in this earliest massive QG.",

      "abstract": "Halo Spin Depends on The Distance to Large-scale Filament Shihong Liu, Yu Rong Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We employ a semi-analytical methodology to estimate the dark matter halo spin of HI gas-rich galaxies in the Arecibo Legacy Fast Alfa Survey and investigate the relationship between halo spin and the proximity of galaxies to large-scale filaments. We exclude galaxies with low HI signal-to-noise ratios, those potentially influenced by velocity dispersions, and those affiliated with galaxy clusters/groups. Additionally, we apply a mass-weighting technique to ensure consistent mass distribution across galaxy samples at varying distances from filaments. Our analysis reveals, for the first time, a subtle yet statistically significant correlation between halo spin and filament distance in observational data, indicating higher spins closer to filaments. This suggests that the tidal forces exerted by filaments may impact the spin of dark matter halos.",

Employing a sink-particle module, we self-consistently resolve star formation and feedback, avoiding reliance on simplified models. We investigate the effects of stellar feedback mechanisms, gas return from star-forming clouds, and disk mass on the starburst and outflow. Our simulations generate a starburst lasting $\\sim25$ Myr, peaking at 20-50 $\\rm{M_{\\odot},yr^{-1}}$, although the total stellar mass often exceeds M82's estimated value. The outflow develops in two stages: initially, continuous SNe form small bubbles that merge into a superbubble containing warm/hot gas and intermediate- to high-density cool filaments. After $\\sim10$ Myr, the superbubble breaks out of the disk, and within $\\sim15$ Myr a kpc-scale outflow forms. Cool filaments survive stellar feedback, become entrained in the wind, and stretch to hundreds of parsecs. Transport from the cool ISM is the dominant net contributor to the total mass of the cool phase in the outflow, whereas transfers from hotter phases, such as through condensation or precipitation, provide only a minor net contribution, likely offset by simultaneous transfer from the cool phase back to hotter phases. While the mass loading factor is comparable to M82, the cool gas outflow rate and velocity are lower, with velocities $\\sim60\\%$ below observed values; warm and hot gas are $\\sim25\\%$ slower. SN feedback is the primary driver, and gas return significantly influences the starburst and outflow, while other factors are secondary. Stronger clustered SN feedback is likely required to better match observations.",

      "abstract": "Shape Shifting Light Dark Matter Solitons Dor Ben-Amotz Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Dark matter consisting of a Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) of ultra-light particles is predicted to have a soliton shape that shifts with the dark matter mass fraction in galaxies containing a centrally localized point mass (or black hole), consistent with previous numerical results and analytical approximations in both the cored self-gravitating and cusped hydrogenic limits. Solutions of the Schrödinger-Poisson equation with baryonic coupling are here accurately represented as a sum of five Gaussians with numerically optimized amplitudes and widths, thereby facilitating galactic predictions and observational comparisons as a function of dark matter mass fraction. The results are used to derive mass, energy and velocity scaling relations as functions of soliton mass fraction, as well as to predict dark matter halo size, mass and core density in terms of observed half-light radii and velocity dispersions by invoking observationally validated approximations relating rotational velocity and velocity dispersion. Applications of the predictions, as well as challenges associated with critically testing dark matter models, are illustrated using comparisons with dwarf spheroidal (dSph) and ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy observations, which, under the present soliton-based modeling assumptions, are found to be compatible with soliton particle masses of the order of $10^{-22}$ (eV/c$^2$), with an upper bound of approximately $3\\times 10^{-22}$ (eV/c$^2$). Implications of the results are discussed, including speculations regarding the role of dark matter evaporation in galactic evolution.",

This REBELS-MOSFIRE sample is notable for its bright median UV luminosity (Muv=-22.5 AB) and large median stellar mass (log(Mstar/Msun)=9.2). Although three sources show tentative evidence of a CIII] detection, we obtain no confident detections for any of the 8 REBELS-MOSFIRE sources. The median [CIII]1907+CIII]1909 3-sigma upper limit in equivalent width (EW) for the REBELS-MOSFIRE sample is 6.5 AA, and a stack of their H-band MOSFIRE spectra yields a non-detection with an associated 3-sigma upper limit of 2.6 AA. These upper limits fall significantly below the CIII] EW measured in a composite spectrum of representative z~7 star-forming galaxies, as well as those measured for notable early star-forming galaxies such as GN-z11, GHZ2, GS-z12, and RXCJ2248-ID. The lack of strong CIII] emission can be understood within the context of the stellar populations of the REBELS galaxies, as well as the ionization conditions and gas-phase metallicity implied by rest-frame optical spectroscopic properties ([OIII]+Hb EWs, and [OIII]5007/[OII]3727 and [NeIII]3869/[OII]3727 line ratios). The REBELS-MOSFIRE sample represents the higher-mass, higher-metallicity, lower-excitation tail of the z~7 galaxy population, whose ionizing properties must be fully characterized to constrain the role of star-forming galaxies during cosmic reionization.",

Zanchettin Submitted to A&A; 22 pages (plus 4 pages of supplementary material), 8 figures (plus 9 in the appendix and supplementary material); Abstract adapted from original Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a multi-phase study of the gas in the circumnuclear region (~1.1x1.0 kpc^2) of the nearby Seyfert 1.8 galaxy NGC 1365, observed in the context of the Mid-IR Activity of Circumnuclear Line Emission (MIRACLE) program. We combined spatially resolved spectroscopic observations from JWST/MIRI, VLT/MUSE, and ALMA to investigate the ionized atomic gas and the warm and cold molecular phases. MIRI data revealed over 40 mid-IR emission lines from ionized and warm molecular gas. Moment maps show that both cold and warm molecular gas follow the rotation of the stellar disk along the circumnuclear ring. The ionized gas displays flux and kinematic patterns that depend on ionization potential (IP): low-IP species (<25 eV) trace the disk, while higher-IP lines (up to ~120 eV) trace outflowing material. The [O III]5700 and [Ne V]14 lines both trace the southeast nuclear outflow cone. Additionally, [Ne V]14 detects the northwest counter-cone, obscured in the optical and thus invisible in [O III]5700. Mid-IR diagnostics, unlike optical ones, clearly reveal the AGN as the primary ionization source in the nucleus. Emission from high-IP species is spatially coincident with the ionization cones and not with star-forming regions. Using the [Ne V]24/[Ne V]14 ratio, we derive an electron density of (750+-440) cm^(-3), in agreement with values from the [S II] optical doublet. For the first time, we apply a fully self-consistent approach combining advanced photoionization and kinematic models (HOMERUN+MOKA3D) to constrain intrinsic outflow properties, overcoming the limitations of simplified classical methods. Exploiting the synergy of JWST/MIRI and VLT/MUSE, HOMERUN reproduces fluxes of over 60 emission lines from optical to mid-IR, disentangling AGN and star formation contributions and yielding robust estimates of outflow mass, geometry, and energetics.",

      "abstract": "Improved Radiative Transfer Corrections in Helium Emission Lines Oleg Kurichin, Alexandre Ivanchik Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a new detailed model of the He I collisional-recombination spectrum based on the most up-to-date atomic data. The model accounts for radiative transfer effects and the influence of a non-zero optical depth in He I lines arising from transitions to the metastable 2^3S state. The model reveals substantial deviations in the emissivities of the lambda3889 and lambda7065 lines in the case of a non-zero optical depth, with previous models systematically underestimating and overestimating them by 5 to 20 percent, respectively. In the optically thin case, however, our results show good agreement with previous studies. Using the new model, we compute optically thin emissivities for a wide set of UV, optical, and IR He I recombination lines over a fine grid of electron densities and temperatures typical for H II regions and planetary nebulae (1 <= ne <= 10^4 cm^-3, 8000 <= Te <= 22000 K). In addition, we present new fitting formulae for radiative transfer corrections for several He I lines relevant to optical and near-infrared observations, covering 0 <= tau_3889 <= 10 within the same density and temperature ranges. The accuracy of the obtained approximations is <= 0.1 percent within the specified parameter range. These results can be readily implemented in modern codes for determining the primordial 4He abundance and are also applicable to a broader range of spectroscopic analyses of He I emission lines.",

Accompanying Python module available at this https URL. Raw data available at this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Open clusters are among the most useful and widespread tracers of Galactic structure. The completeness of the Galactic open cluster census, however, remains poorly understood. For the first time ever, we establish the selection function of an entire open cluster census, publishing our results as an open-source Python package for use by the community. Our work is valid for the Hunt & Reffert catalogue of clusters in Gaia DR3. We developed and open-sourced our cluster simulator from our first work. Then, we performed 80,590 injection and retrievals of simulated open clusters to test the Hunt & Reffert catalogue's sensitivity. We fit a logistic model of cluster detectability that depends only on a cluster's number of stars, median parallax error, Gaia data density, and a user-specified significance threshold. We find that our simple model accurately predicts cluster detectability, with a 94.53\\% accuracy on our training data that is comparable to a machine-learning based model with orders of magnitude more parameters. Our model itself offers numerous insights on why certain clusters are detected. We briefly use our model to show that cluster detectability depends on non-intuitive parameters, such as a cluster's proper motion, and we show that even a modest 25 km/s boost to a cluster's orbital speed can result in an almost 3$\\times$ higher detection probability, depending on its position. In addition, we publish our raw cluster injection and retrievals and cluster memberships, which could be used for a number of other science cases -- such as estimating cluster membership incompleteness. Using our results, selection effect-corrected studies are now possible with the open cluster census. Our work will enable a number of brand new types of study, such as detailed comparisons between the Milky Way's cluster census and recent extragalactic cluster samples.",

Trager 17 pages (3 pages appendix), 19 figures. Accepted for publication in A&A. Catalogue of Galaxy Bar Classification submitted to CDS and available at this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate the role of galactic bars in fuelling and triggering Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in disc galaxies up to $z\\sim 0.8$. We utilise a Deep Learning model, fine-tuned on Galaxy Zoo volunteer classifications, to identify (strongly and weakly) barred and unbarred disc galaxies in Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program $i$-band images. We select AGN using three independent diagnostics: mid-infrared colours, X-ray detections, and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. The SED analysis, performed using CIGALE, quantifies the relative AGN contribution to the total galaxy luminosity ($f_{\\rm AGN}$) and the AGN luminosity ($L_{\\rm disc}$). We assess the impact of bars by comparing AGN incidence and properties in barred galaxies against carefully constructed redshift-, stellar mass-, and colour-matched unbarred control samples. Our binary AGN classification experiment demonstrates that barred disc galaxies host a higher fraction of AGN compared to their unbarred counterparts, though the significance depends on the AGN selection method, with a more modest excess for SED AGN, and control sample size. This suggests a contributing role for bars in the global AGN budget. The contribution of bars to AGN fuelling appears confined to systems where the AGN has a lower relative contribution to the host galaxy's emission ($f_{\\rm AGN} < 0.75$). Crucially, we find a significant dearth of barred disc galaxies hosting AGN with $f_{\\rm AGN} > 0.75$, independent of bar strength. Consistent with this, the fraction of barred galaxies among AGN hosts decreases with increasing $L_{\\rm disc}$. Combined with previous results, we suggest that bars may contribute to fuelling the population of low-to-moderate luminosity AGN, but major mergers are the principal mechanism for triggering the most powerful and dominant accretion events.",

Hornstrup Accepted for publication by A&A in the Special Issue `Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1)', 16 pages, 7 figures, 1 appendix Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) (Abridged) The bimodality between star-forming discs and quiescent spheroids requires the existence of two main processes: the galaxy quenching and the morphological transformation. In this paper, we aim to understand the link between these processes and their relation with the stellar mass of galaxies and their local environment. Taking advantage of the first data released by the Euclid Collaboration, covering more than 60 deg2 with space-based imaging and photometry, we analyse a mass-complete sample of nearly one million galaxies in the range 0.25<z<1 with $M_\\ast>10^{9.5} M_\\odot$. We divide the sample into four sub-populations of galaxies, based on their star-formation activity and morphology. We then analyse the physical properties of these populations and their relative abundances in the stellar mass vs. local density plane. Together with confirming the passivity-density relation and the morphology-density relation, we find that quiescent discy galaxies are more abundant in the low-mass regime of high-density environment. At the same time, star-forming bulge-dominated galaxies are more common in field regions, preferentially at high masses. Building on these results and interpreting them through comparison with simulations, we propose a scenario where the evolution of galaxies in the field significantly differs from that in higher-density environments. The morphological transformation in the majority of field galaxies takes place before the onset of quenching and is mainly driven by secular processes taking place within the main sequence, leading to the formation of star-forming bulge-dominated galaxies as intermediate-stage galaxies. Conversely, quenching of star formation precedes morphological transformation for most galaxies in higher-density environments. This causes the formation of quiescent disc-dominated galaxies before their transition into bulge-dominated ones.",

Zhou, Sami Dib, Pavel Kroupa Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We construct a model by integrating observational constraints from the Milky Way and nearby galaxies to predict cloud-scale star formation rates (SFRs). In the model, we first estimate the initial total mass of clumps in a cloud based on the cloud mass, and then generate the initial clump population of the cloud using the initial clump mass function. Next, we model the star formation histories (SFHs) of the cloud to assign an age to each clump. We then sort out the intermediate-age clumps and calculate the total embedded cluster mass. Finally, we predict the SFR based on the duration of the embedded phase. The model-predicted SFR is broadly consistent with the observed SFR, supporting the plausibility of the model. The model primarily provides a theoretical framework that integrates a wide range of observational results, thereby clarifying the tasks for future observations.",

Saitoh, Yutaka Hirai, Hideyuki Umeda, Yuki Isobe, Chris Nagele 14 pages, 11 figures, submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Spectroscopic observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed young, compact, high-redshift ($z$) galaxies with high nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) ratios. GN-z11 at z=10.6 is one of these galaxies. One possible scenario for such a high N/O ratio is pollution from supermassive stars (SMSs), from which stellar winds are expected to be nitrogen-rich. The abundance pattern is determined by both galaxy evolution and SMS pollution, but so far, simple one-zone models have been used. Using a galaxy formation simulation, we tested the SMS scenario. We used a cosmological zoom-in simulation that includes chemical evolution driven by rotating massive stars (Wolf-Rayet stars), supernovae, and asymptotic giant branch stars. As a post-process, we assumed the formation of an SMS with a mass between $10^3$ and $10^5$ $M_\\odot$ and investigated the contribution of its ejecta to the abundance pattern. The N/O ratio was enhanced by the SMS ejecta, and the abundance pattern of GN-z11, including carbon-to-oxygen and oxygen-to-hydrogen ratios, was reproduced by our SMS pollution model if the pollution mass fraction ranges within 10-30 per cent. Such a pollution fraction can be realized when the gas ionized by the SMS is polluted, and the gas density is $10^4$-$10^5$ cm$^{-3}$ assuming a Strömgren sphere. We also compared the abundance pattern with those of other N/O-enhanced high-$z$ galaxies. Some of these galaxies can also be explained by SMS pollution.",

Willcox, H. Sana 14 Pages + 5 Pages in the Appendix, 12 Figures, 1 Table Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Massive stars are the key engines of the Universe. However, their evolution and thus their ionizing feedback are still not fully understood. One of the largest gaps in current stellar evolution calculations is the lack of a model for the mass ejections that occur when the stars reach the Eddington limit, such as during an Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) phase. We aim to remedy this situation by providing a physically motivated and empirically calibrated method applicable in any 1D stellar evolution code to approximate the effect of such mass loss on stellar evolution. We employ the 1D stellar evolution code MESA, in which we implement a new mass-loss prescription that is acting when stellar models inflate too much when reaching the Eddington limit. Synthetic massive-star stellar populations using calculated grids of single-star models with this mass loss prescription are compared with the observed populations in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. In combination with already computed grids of binary evolution models, we investigate the impact of binarity on our predictions. Our single-star models reproduce key features of the observed stellar populations, namely (i) the absence of stars located beyond the Humphreys-Davidson limit, (ii) an upper limit of RSG luminosities, (iii) the faintest observed single WR stars, (iv) the absolute number of O-stars, WRs, and RSGs, (v) WO stars in low metallicity environments, and (vi) the positions of LBV stars in the HRD. Our binary population explains at the same time the 70% binary fraction of O-stars and the 40% binary fraction of WR stars. However, our synthetic population also has caveats, such as an overproduction of bright H-free WN stars. Our results show that the effect of Eddington-limit induced mass ejections on the structure and evolution of massive stars can remove tension between predicted and observed massive star populations.",

Montet 18 pages, 13 figures, Submitted to MNRAS Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Photometric light curves suffer from fundamental degeneracies that limit surface information recovery. We demonstrate that astrometry enables access to complementary information through photocentre variations induced by rotating surface features. The forthcoming commissioning of microarcsecond-precision astrometric missions presents an opportunity to improve stellar surface mapping. This paper extends a previous theoretical framework for stellar surface mapping, along three primary directions: (1) we derive analytical selection rules showing that astrometry is sensitive to spherical harmonic modes not detectable via photometry, particularly odd-$\\ell$ modes that encode north-south asymmetries; (2) we quantify the information content of combined photometric and astrometric observations, showing that the rank of observable modes grows faster for combined observations than for either technique alone, though the fraction of recoverable modes still decreases asymptotically with increasing spatial resolution; and (3) we reframe astrometric jitter-traditionally treated as noise in exoplanet studies-as a signal encoding stellar surface structure. Given the limited proposed target lists of high-precision astrometric missions, this capability is particularly valuable: understanding host star surfaces is crucial for both removing stellar signals from exoplanet detections and characterising star-planet interactions. We show that while Sun-like stars require sub-microarcsecond precision, evolved stars with angular diameter and larger spots present immediate opportunities with current technology, such as the Gaia mission.",

Hero III Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Astrometric jitter noise arises when starspots on a rotating stellar surface move in and out of view, shifting the photocenter. This noise may limit our ability to detect and weigh small, sub-Neptune-sized planets around active stars. By deriving a linear forward model for the astrometric jitter signal of a rotating star in a spherical-harmonic coordinate system, we show that jitter noise can be used to reconstruct surface-brightness maps and, in principle, disentangle jitter from stellar reflex motion due to an orbiting planet. Furthermore, we show that astrometry and photometry probe complementary surface information: photometry measures even-degree spherical harmonic surfaces that are symmetric about the equator, while astrometry measures odd-degree modes. Their joint use, therefore, breaks degeneracies in surface mapping. Our model further quantifies the variation in the astrometric signal with inclination angle, which is foundational for studies of worst-case configurations of astrometric star-spot noise. For example, we show that pole-on stellar inclinations lead to poorly constrained inversions, as any stellar surface produces a purely circular astrometric jitter signal. We characterize the degeneracy in jointly identifying the stellar surface and stellar inclination, and develop a surface estimation approach. Using this approach, we present example simulations and reconstructions that demonstrate the use of astrometry data alongside light-curve data to improve stellar surface mapping and localize spot positions in latitude and longitude. With forthcoming high-precision Gaia astrometry, astrometric surface mapping provides a promising new approach to probe stellar activity.",

Haberl 6 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication as letter to editor in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) As the only known unambiguous star in a Maunder minimum-like chromospheric activity state, the properties of HD 166620 can provide valuable insight into the behaviour of the Sun during the historic extended low-states of its activity cycle. The coronal X-ray activity of HD 166620 has so far only been probed with a ROSAT/HRI observation in 1996, near the chromospheric activity maximum before the star entered its grand minimum around 2004. We conducted a deep {\\it XMM-Newton} observation of HD 166620 during its chromospheric Ca II H&K activity grand minimum to achieve a better understanding of its magnetic activity. We detected HD 166620 with an X-ray luminosity of ${{\\rm log}\\,L_{\\rm X}\\,\\rm{(erg\\,s^{-1})}=26.56^{+0.10}_{-0.12}}$, corresponding to ${{\\rm log}\\,(L_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm bol}) = -6.58^{+0.10}_{-0.12}}$ and an X-ray surface flux of log Fx (erg/cm^2/s) = 3.97+0.10-0.12. With respect to the earlier ROSAT observation, the X-ray brightness of HD 166620 has decreased by a factor of 2.5 during its Maunder minimum-like state. To place its X-ray properties into context, we constructed an X-ray sample of late-type stars within 10 pc of the Sun. The activity of HD 166620 is below the levels of all other K dwarfs in the 10 pc sample. The corona of HD 166620 during its grand minimum emits at the level of the solar background corona, which implies that it has no large active magnetic structures. Along with long-term Ca II H&K monitoring of HD 166620, this result provides evidence that the solar activity during the Maunder minimum was not reduced significantly below the levels seen during its present-day cycle minima. The similar X-ray surface flux of HD 166620 and the modern quiet Sun, and also their Rossby number near the critical value of spin-down models, suggest a connection between the regime of weakened magnetic braking and the occurrence of Maunder minimum states.",

Brummell 34 pages, 14 figures, 8 tables, 8 appendices, 3 videos in online journal Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) At the base of the Sun's convective zone, a narrow shear layer called the tachocline separates strong latitudinal differential rotation above from nearly rigid rotation in the radiative zone below. The observed thinness of the tachocline is a long-standing dynamical puzzle because the tachocline should have spread significantly due to inward-burrowing meridional circulation, also called \"radiative spreading.\" We recently presented the first pair of global simulations to reveal a statistically stationary tachocline confined against radiative spreading by the Maxwell stresses from the nonaxisymmetric modes of a dynamo, which penetrated into and below the tachocline through a novel magnetic skin effect. In the work presented here, we systematically examine how this \"dynamo confinement scenario\" works against radiative spreading in a suite of simulations as the governing parameters trend in the direction of the true solar regime. We find that as the stable stratification of the radiative zone is made progressively stronger, the dynamo cycles get longer, the magnetic field consequently penetrates deeper due to the skin effect, and the tachocline becomes more confined. Furthermore, these results have interesting consequences for solar spin-down. In all of our radiatively spreading simulations, the tachocline region spins down due to the burrowing circulation. Below the tachocline, the Maxwell stresses transmit this spin-down further to rigidify the deeper radiative zone. We thus speculate that, in addition to confining the tachocline, the dynamo may provide a pathway to communicate spin-down from the near-surface layers to the deep interior.",

We investigate two such intervals inside an ICME observed by the \\textit{Wind} spacecraft on 8--9 June 2000 and characterize their associated wave populations. We focus on spectral analysis and plasma instability analysis, using ion-scale normalized magnetic helicity and polarization properties with respect to the background magnetic field $B_0$. In the first interval, the ion-scale normalized magnetic helicity shows a left-handed circularly polarized signature. In the second interval, the left-handed signature persists and an additional high-frequency right-handed population appears. The propagation is approximately parallel to $B_0$. The left-handed fluctuations are compatible with Alfvén ion-cyclotron (AIC) waves, while the right-handed fluctuations are consistent with fast magnetosonic/whistler (FM/W) waves. The ICME plasma accesses resonance conditions that support multiple ion-scale wave modes. Evolving anisotropies in the plasma and the approach to marginal stability allow the coexistence of AIC-like and fast-magnetosonic/whistler-like fluctuations, with enhanced electron heating favoring the growth of the FM/W contribution and strengthening the density--magnetic-field magnitude correlation.",

Escorza 14 pages, 2 tables, 15 figures, accepted for A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Despite the importance of magnetic fields in massive stars, their origin is widely debated and still not well understood. With the mounting evidence for the importance of studying magnetic fields in interacting massive binary and multiple systems, it appears necessary to investigate the presence of magnetic fields in semi-detached systems with ongoing mass transfer, and in contact systems where mass is actively being exchanged. We present an analysis of 53 high-resolution HARPSpol spectropolarimetric observations of a sample of 14 massive binary and multiple systems using the least-squares deconvolution technique. The majority of the studied systems are classified as semi-detached or contact binaries. Definite detections of the presence of a magnetic field are achieved in all studied systems apart from the rather faint system SV Cen, for which only a marginal detection was obtained. The fact that the presence of magnetic fields is detected in all but one of the studied systems strongly suggests that interaction between the system components plays a definite role in the generation of magnetic fields in massive stars. The measured mean longitudinal magnetic field strength for all targets is of the order of a few hundred Gauss to a few kiloGauss. The strongest longitudinal magnetic fields of 4 to 5kG are discovered in the massive O-type triple system MY Ser in both components of the contact binary. kiloGauss-order magnetic fields are also detected in two other systems, V1294 Sco and V606 Cen. It is possible that there is an implication of some system characteristics, such as multiplicity, the mass ratio between the components, and a large fillout factor, on the measured magnetic field strength. Our results for the magnetic field measurements in interacting binaries present the first assessment of the occurrence rate of magnetic fields in a representative sample of such systems.",

Heng Accepted for publication in A&A. 24 pages, 11 figures, 9 tables Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) offers exceptional spectral resolution and wavelength coverage, which are essential for studying the coldest brown dwarfs, particularly Y dwarfs. These objects are at the cold end of the sub-stellar sequence and exhibit atmospheric phenomena such as cloud formation, chemical disequilibrium, and radiative-convective coupling. We examine a curated sample of 22 late-T to Y dwarfs through Bayesian atmospheric retrieval (nested sampling) and supervised machine learning (random forests). Bayesian model comparison indicates that cloud-free models are generally favored for the hottest objects in the sample (T6-T8). Conversely, later-type dwarfs exhibit varying preferences, with both gray-cloud and cloud-free models providing comparable fits. The atmospheric parameters retrieved are consistent across the applied methodologies. Evidence of vertical mixing and disequilibrium chemistry is found in several objects; notably, the Y1 dwarf WISEPAJ1541-22 favors a gray cloud model and shows elevated abundances of both CO and CO2 compared to equilibrium chemistry calculations. As anticipated, the abundances of H2O, CH4, and NH3 increase with decreasing effective temperature over the T-Y sequence.",

The stars LAMOST J1132 and LAMOST J0529 have not yet been recorded in the SIMBAD astronomical database. We have investigated their physical properties via methods such as spectral analysis, photometric analysis, and light curve analysis. Based on comprehensive analysis, we conclude that they are two newly discovered binary systems, each consisting of a hot white dwarf and a flaring companion star. Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) spectra indicate that both stars contain hot white dwarfs. The spectral fitting yields $T_{eff}$=53728$\\pm$2467\\,K, log$g$=7.98$\\pm$0.08 for LAMOST J1132, and $T_{eff}$=47381$\\pm$494\\,K, log$g$=7.84$\\pm$0.05 for LAMOST J0529. The weak neutral metal lines in the LAMOST spectra and the discrepancy between the Global Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics (GAIA) and LAMOST spectra both indicate that these two sources are likely binary systems. The relatively high flux values for both sources in the near-infrared and mid-infrared bands support our preliminary judgment. The color index in the near-infrared bands suggests that the companion star is K or M type for LAMOST J1132 and M type for LAMOST J0529. Light curve data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) indicate that the companion stars of both sources are stars exhibiting flare activity. The eclipse probability is very low, indicating that these two sources are non-eclipsing binary systems. The physics of binaries is fascinating, and future data from LAMOST Medium Resolution Spectra are expected to enable the detection of magnetic fields in these two hot white dwarfs.",

They are critical for understanding energy release and transport mechanisms in solar flares and for conducting comparative studies with stellar WLFs. However, the scarcity of accurately and reliably measured optical continuum light curves for solar WLFs significantly hampers related studies. Based on the optimized solar WLF identification method, we construct a dataset of optical continuum light curves for 70 solar WLFs using 6173 Å continuum intensity images from the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Moreover, for each solar WLF event, we also provide the location of the white-light emission enhancement signals and key parameters including bolometric energies and durations derived from both the traditional fixed-temperature blackbody model and the refined variable-temperature blackbody model. This dataset will serve as a valuable resource for future statistical investigations of solar WLFs and for comparative studies between solar and stellar flares.",

In the adiabatic analysis, the \"propagation diagram\" for convective mode is proposed as a useful tool to see its behavior. In the non-adiabatic analysis, it is found that for strongly non-adiabatic case, a monotonically growing convective mode becomes oscillatory. In this phase, the radial displacement and the distribution of wave energy show only one bump, in which the distribution of entropy energy eS almost overlaps with the distribution of gravity energy eg. Entropy energy eS seems to act as potential energy of oscillatory convection. In addition to this, this change occurs not gradually, but abruptly with change of non-adiabatic indicator.",

García Accepted for publication in MNRAS Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Binaries in which both stars are pulsating are rare but extremely valuable. We present the first study of an asteroseismic binary system consisting of a core helium-burning red clump (RC) star and a red giant branch (RGB) star. The Kepler target KIC 10841730 is a wide binary (period $2917 \\pm 8$ d) that provides ideal conditions to test the accuracy of RC models. While prior studies of RC stars have revealed discrepancies in modelling the period spacings of mixed modes, other model parameters remain largely untested. We perform a detailed modelling analysis using individual mode frequencies and cover a large parameter space in mass, metallicity, He-abundance, mixing length, overshooting, and mass-loss, and we also explore different methods to correct for surface effects. We find two possible results for the red clump models. One solution requires introducing an unexpected offset of the phase shift in the red clump model, yielding an age consistent with the companion star and current masses of $1.01 \\pm 0.06$ and $1.08 \\pm 0.06$ M$_\\odot$ for the RC and RGB star, respectively. Alternatively, we find that excluding the identification of two questionable radial modes resolves the phase-shift offset issue but results in a higher mass and thus a much younger age for the red clump star, contradicting the age obtained from its companion. We conclude that uncertainties in red clump models affect not only the g-mode period spacings but also the properties of the p modes. We show the power of asteroseismic binaries in validating and constraining stellar models and highlight the need for refining red-clump models.",

Accounting for $\\sim$20% of all B-type stars, most CBe stars are thought to form through mass and angular momentum transfer from their companions. It follows that in most close CBe star binaries, the companions are expected to be post-main-sequence stars rather than main-sequence (MS) stars. Hitherto, $\\sim$100 CBe star binaries have been identified, the majority of which are Be/X-ray binaries. As expected, none of the others have indeed been confirmed as CBe+MS binary stars. To further study and verify the origin of CBe stars, identifying additional CBe star binaries is indispensable. In this study, we report 504 CBe stars identified using data from Data Release 12 of the Large sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope. Among these, 141 are newly identified and 14 exhibiting radial velocity variations are identified as CBe star binaries. Besides, 60 CBe stars with high normalized unit weight error (RUWE) but not confirmed by dynamics are proposed as potential CBe star binaries. We also find that 34 CBe stars are potential cluster members. By calculating peculiar velocities, 37 runaway stars are identified with peculiar velocities ranging from $\\sim$40 km s$^{-1}$ to $\\sim$101 km s$^{-1}$.",

Specifically, we focus on spectra contaminated by moonlight, which exhibit near-zero radial velocity (RV) and solar-like spectral lines from the secondary component. By applying strict constraints on the contamination parameters and fitting the contaminated spectra, we ultimately confirmed that 126 false positive binaries are single stars contaminated by moonlight. Additionally, we identify several key factors contributing to moonlight contamination: the lunar phase during observation, the G-band magnitude of the star, and the angular distance between the star and the moon. Notably, artificial satellites in low-orbital can also introduce contamination from solar-like spectral components, but they typically display significantly higher transverse velocities. In a follow-up study, we will expand our analysis to identify additional false positive SB2 systems and systematically classify them according to their contamination sources.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Context. Understanding the survival and orbital evolution of brown dwarf (BD) companions during the post-main-sequence (MS) evolution of their host stars is increasingly important, especially with recent discoveries of many substellar companions around white dwarfs (WDs). Aims. We investigate the long-term evolution and final outcomes of BDs orbiting low-mass MS stars as these evolve into WDs. By comparing forward-modeling populations with observed WD-BD binaries, we test evolutionary models and predict the existence of yet-undetected systems. Methods. We employ the COMPAS binary population synthesis code to evolve observed MS-BD systems through the post-MS phases of their host stars into the WD stage, tracking orbital changes driven by mass loss, tides, and common-envelope (CE) evolution. Results. Our simulations reproduce a period gap in the distribution of detached WD-BD binaries, consistent with observations. We also identify a boundary separating detached and semi-detached systems on the period-mass diagram, located at orbital periods of $\\sim$1-2 hours depending on the BD mass. Conclusions. We predict that a subset of currently known MS-BD binaries will survive post-MS evolution and emerge as detached WD-BD systems, while others will undergo CE evolution and potentially form cataclysmic variables with BD donors. Our results reproduce the observed period gap in WD-BD binaries and provide quantitative predictions for the role of CE efficiency in shaping their distribution. This work predicts that many WD-BD systems remain undetected, motivating targeted searches with microlensing and high-contrast imaging techniques using next-generation large telescopes.",

Building on established Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based approaches for forecasting the continuum intensity decrease associated with AR emergence, this work expands the modeling with new architectures and targets. We investigate a sliding-window Transformer architecture to forecast continuum intensity evolution up to 12 hours ahead using data from 46 ARs observed by SDO/HMI. We conduct a systematic ablation study to evaluate two key components: (1) the inclusion of a temporal 1D convolutional (Conv1D) front-end and (2) a novel `Early Detection' architecture featuring attention biases and a timing-aware loss function. Our best-performing model, combining the Early Detection architecture without the Conv1D layer, achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.1189 (representing a 10.6% improvement over the LSTM baseline) and an average advance warning time of 4.73 hours (timing difference of -4.73h), even under a stricter emergence criterion than previous studies. While the Transformer demonstrates superior aggregate timing and accuracy, we note that this high-sensitivity detection comes with increased variance compared to smoother baseline models. However, this volatility is a necessary trade-off for operational warning systems: the model's ability to detect micro-changes in precursor signals enables significantly earlier detection, outweighing the cost of increased noise. Our results demonstrate that Transformer architectures modified with early detection biases, when used without temporal smoothing layers, provide a high-sensitivity alternative for forecasting AR emergence that prioritizes advance warning over statistical smoothness.",

The conclusion of subgiant primary is also supported by the absence of lithium absorption and no observed infrared excess.

The shock parameters, including the normal speed, oblique angles, compression ratio, and Alfven Mach number, were derived by combining a steady-state solar-wind simulation with the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the shock surface based on multi-view observations. We compared the local shock parameters at the magnetic connecting points with in situ proton intensities and peak spectra to establish the link between shock evolution and SEP characteristics. The shock nose consistently exhibited higher particle-acceleration efficiency with the largest normal speed, compression ratio, and supercritical Alfven Mach number, while the flanks showed delayed transition to supercritical Alfven Mach number with weaker efficiency. The earliest and most rapid proton enhancement of STEREO-B correlated with efficient shock acceleration and prompt magnetic connectivity to the shock. Spectral analysis revealed that proton energy spectra were consistent with the relativistic diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) estimations. The initial shock acceleration began at about 1.4-5 Rsun and caused the widespread longitudinal SEP distribution. The longitudinal dependence of SEP intensity and spectral variations arise from the combined influence of 3D shock properties, magnetic connectivity, and particle transport processes. The agreement between in situ proton indices and relativistic DSA estimations supports DSA in this SEP event and provides insights into the early-stage acceleration at the source region.",

Ertel Accepted for publication in A&A. 17 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Exocomets are small bodies that evaporate when they approach their host star. They are detected through variability of non-photospheric features with spectroscopy and/or asymmetric transits in time-series photometry. In the past four decades ~30 systems have shown such variations, and were therefore classified as exocomet host stars. However, some publications have pointed out mechanisms that might mimic exocometary features, and therefore, careful monitoring is needed to confirm the origin of the observed variability. With this paper we aim to investigate the exocomet nature of the non-photospheric variable features observed in the exocomet candidate stars HD 36546, HD 42111 and HD 85905. All of them have shown some degree of variability, particularly in their Ca II K line. We analysed the non-photospheric Ca II K line features from high-resolution spectra obtained using new NOT/FIES and Mercator/HERMES, and some additional archival spectra of the target stars. The variability was quantified through the changes in the equivalent widths of those features, which are assumed to be of circumstellar origin. Column densities were also estimated for each variable feature. Strong variability was found for HD 85905, consistent with a potential link to exocometary activity. However, the binarity of the system, which we confirmed through interferometric VLTI/PIONIER observations, complicates the interpretation of these signatures and prevents us from drawing definitive conclusions. The remaining two sources do not show any significant variability, but due to the sporadic nature of the exocometary events, we cannot discard the exocomet hypothesis. Further monitoring of the stars will be necessary to carry out a robust determination of the variability patterns and timescales that would completely rule out other scenarios.",

Deeg accepted as Letter for publication in Astronomy&Astrophysics (4+5 pages, 5 figures) Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Asteroseismology is widely used for precise determining of masses of solar-like oscillating stars by performing individual-frequency modeling or applying homological scaling relations. However, these methods lack dynamical validation on the main sequence due to the absence of eclipsing double-lined binary system (SB2) as benchmark objects. By providing the orbital inclination, astrometric binary systems from ESA Gaia DR3 offer an abundant alternative for eclipsing systems. We present KIC693187 as the first SB2, hosting a solar-like oscillating post-main-sequence star with dynamical masses. By combining Gaia astrometry with spectroscopic obtained with the Las Cumbres Observatory network (LCO), we find $M_1^\\mathrm{dyn}$=0.99$\\pm$0.05$M_\\odot$ and $M_2^\\mathrm{dyn}$=0.89$\\pm$0.04$M_\\odot$ for the primary and secondary, respectively. Asteroseismic parameters were extracted from photometry of the NASA \\Kepler satellite. The mass from individual frequency modeling is $M_1^\\mathrm{IF}$=0.92$\\pm$0.01$M_\\odot$. Taking into account the systematic uncertainty of 0.04$M_\\odot$ for best fit models from individual frequency fitting, we find an agreement within 1.2$\\sigma$. From scaling relations we obtain a mass range of 0.93 to 0.98$M_\\odot$ by using the observed large frequency separations (\\dnu) in the scaling relations for the primary. By using standard corrections for departures from the asymptotic regime of \\dnu, we obtained a mass range of 0.83 to 1.03$M_\\odot$. The upper ends of both ranges agree well with the dynamical mass of the primary. This approach provides the first empirical validation for main-sequence solar-like oscillators and opens a new window for validating asteroseismology. Through a dedicatded program targeting astrometric SB2 binary systems, ESA's PLATO space mission will provide will enlarge the benchmark sample substantially.",

Starrfield 8 Page, 5 Figures, 1 Table, To Appear in the Astrophysical J Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The forbidden lines of [Fe XIII] at 10,747 Angstrom and 10,798 Angsrtom are among the most prominent lines in the near-infrared spectrum of the solar corona. They have been used routinely, both outside and during eclipses, as sensitive probes of the electron density and polarization in the solar corona. Many novae pass through a coronal phase, wherein the highly ionized nova ejecta have physical conditions that are remarkably similar to those of the solar corona. Many of the coronal emission lines that are seen are common to the spectra of both the Sun and novae. Yet, it appears that no robust detection of the [Fe XIII] lines has been made in a nova. Here we report the detection of these two infrared [Fe XIII]lines in the spectrum of the recurrent nova V3890 Sgr, taken 23.43 and 31.35 days after its August 2019 outburst. From their line strengths, we derive values of 10^10 per cubic cm and 10^[8.5-9] per cubic cm for the electron density on the two. The decrease in density between epochs can be explained if the density decreased with a power law n ~ r**alpha with a alpha inferred to be -3. The average temperature of the coronal gas is estimated to be T = (2.51\\pm0.06) x 10^6~K. We find that recurrent novae with giant secondaries, including T CrB whose eruption is imminent, are the most suitable sources for further detections of the [Fe XIII] lines. epochs.",

Economo, Alan Cummings, Jennifer Middleton, Catherine Zucker, Jesse A. Miller, Anna Nica, Maria Hatzaki Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Recent research raises the possibility that 3 and 7 million years ago, the Sun encountered massive clouds that shrank the heliosphere--the solar cocoon protecting our solar system--exposing Earth to its interstellar environment, in agreement with geological evidence from 60Fe and 244Pu isotopes. Here we show that during such encounters Earth was exposed to increased radiation in the form of high-energy particles. During periods of Earth's immersion in the heliosphere, it received particle radiation that we name Heliospheric Energetic Particles (HEPs). The intensity of < 10 MeV protons was at least an order of magnitude more intense than today's most extreme solar energetic particle (SEP) events. SEPs today last minutes to hours, but HEP exposure then lasted for extensive periods of several months, making it a prolonged external driver. During Earth's excursion outside the heliosphere, it was exposed to a galactic cosmic ray radiation with the intensity of < 1 GeV protons at least an order of magnitude more intense than today. Therefore, the space surrounding Earth was permeated by a variable high-energy radiation. We discuss the implications for Earth's climate and biodiversity.",

Campante, Achim Weiss, Bridget Kabugho, Nuno Moedas, Nuno C. Santos, Otto Trust Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The radius valley,a deficit of planets near 2 $\\mathrm{R_{\\oplus}}$, was observed among exoplanets of radius $\\lesssim$ 5 $\\mathrm{R_{\\oplus}}$ with periods $<$ 100 days by NASA's $Kepler$ mission. It separates super-Earths (rocky, $\\lesssim 1.9$ $\\mathrm{R_{\\oplus}}$) from sub-Neptunes (volatile-rich, $\\gtrsim 2$ $\\mathrm{R_{\\oplus}}$) and may arise from formation conditions or atmospheric loss. Disentangling these mechanisms has led to numerous studies of population-level trends, although the resulting interpretations remain sensitive to sample selection and the robustness of host-star parameters. We re-examine its existence, depth, and dependence on period, flux, stellar mass, and age. Using SWEET-Cat and MAISTEP tool, we derived stellar parameters for 1,221 main-sequence stars (1,405 planets), with effective temperatures 4400--7500 K and radii 0.62--2.75 $\\mathrm{R_{\\odot}}$, achieving 2\\% precision in radius and mass. Planetary radii were recomputed from radius ratios, yielding 5\\% median uncertainty. The valley is partially filled near 2 $\\mathrm{R_{\\oplus}}$ and depends on period, flux, and stellar mass, with slopes $-0.12^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$, $0.10^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$, and $0.19^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$. Sub-Neptunes show a stronger stellar mass-dependent trend than super-Earths ($0.17^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ vs $0.11^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$). With stellar age, the super-Earth/sub-Neptune ratio rises from $0.51^{+0.11}_{-0.08}$ ($<3$ Gyr) to $0.64^{+0.11}_{-0.11}$ ($\\gtrsim3$ Gyr), and the valley becomes shallower and shifts to larger radii. A 4D fit shows consistent slopes with 2D analyses and a weaker age trend ($0.07^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$). These results suggest prolonged atmospheric loss, which is consistent with a core-powered mass loss scenario and emphasize the need for improved determinations, a goal expected to be achieved by future missions like PLATO.",

Mustonen, K.Pommois, D. Told, F. Jenko Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We investigate the nonlinear formation of plasmoids in 2D low-beta current sheets through the interplay between the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) and the lower-hybrid drift instability (LHDI). Using a hybrid kinetic-gyrokinetic model-based Super Simple Vlasov (ssV) code with fully kinetic ions and drift-kinetic electrons, we simulate Harris-type current sheets and velocity shear layers with strong cross-field density gradients. Our central hypothesis is that steep density gradients drive LHDI, which can grow faster than KHI and initiate an inverse cascade from kinetic to fluid scales, potentially suppressing KHI. Our simulations confirm that, in thin current sheets, LHDI develops rapidly at the sheet edges and nonlinearly merges into larger-scale magnetic islands before KHI can evolve. These LHDI-driven structures distort the velocity shear and suppress classical KH vortices. In contrast, for thicker current sheets or weaker density gradients, KHI dominates and produces the expected rolled-up vortices and associated plasmoids. These findings demonstrate that LHDI-induced turbulence can act as both a seed and a regulator of plasmoid-generating instabilities, mediating cross-scale energy transfer. This mechanism is relevant to thin boundary layers in space plasmas, such as the solar wind magnetosphere interface, and suggests that microturbulence can govern large-scale magnetic topology during collisionless reconnection.",

Two different kinds of observations are presented. We first analyze observations of Vega taken in a three-telescope mode. (Previously, the instrument had only two operational stations.) We show that, while the efficiency remains nearly identical to that reported in our last paper, the addition of the third station allows more photon data to be recorded simultaneously, and therefore we can build up the photon-bunching peak in the data stream in fewer hours on sky for an unresolved source. In the second part of the paper, we report our observations to date of the nearby red giant star, Arcturus, most of which occurred in the first half of 2025. These show that, as a partially resolved source at the baselines we used, we detect fewercorrelations in the photon-bunching peak than for an unresolved source of comparable brightness. Combining the data with speckle imaging observations taken at Apache Point Observatory, we derive a new measurement of Arcturus' diameter that extends the time baseline of interferometric observations of the star and is consistent with previous analyses made by other investigators.",

Published in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) was recently completed to cover the lack of high-resolution observations of debris discs and to investigate the prevalence of substructures such as radial gaps and rings in a sample of 24 discs. This study characterises the radial structure of debris discs in the ARKS programme. To identify and quantify the disc substructures, we modelled all discs with a range of non-parametric and parametric approaches. We find that of the 24 discs in the sample, 5 host multiple rings, 7 are single rings that display halos or additional low-amplitude rings, and 12 are single rings with at most tentative evidence of additional substructures. The fractional ring widths that we measured are significantly narrower than previously derived values, and they follow a distribution similar to the fractional widths of individual rings resolved in protoplanetary discs. However, there exists a population of rings in debris discs that are significantly wider than those in protoplanetary discs. We also find that discs with steep inner edges consistent with planet sculpting tend to be found at smaller (<100 au) radii, while more radially extended discs tend to have shallower edges more consistent with collisional evolution. An overwhelming majority of discs have radial profiles well-described by either a double power law or double-Gaussian parametrisation. While our findings suggest that it may be possible for some debris discs to inherit their structures directly from protoplanetary discs, there exists a sizeable population of broad debris discs that cannot be explained in this way. Assuming that the distribution of millimetre dust reflects the distribution of planetesimals, mechanisms that cause rings in protoplanetary discs to migrate or debris discs to broaden soon after formation may be at play, possibly mediated by planetary migration or scattering.",

EMEC instability Pablo S Moya, Roberto E Navarro, Marian Lazar, Peter H Yoon, Rodrigo A López, Stefaan Poedts 10 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) In recent years, significant progress has been made in the velocity-moment-based quasi-linear (QL) theory of waves and instabilities in plasmas with nonequilibrium velocity distributions (VDs) of the Kappa (or $\\kappa$) type. However, the temporal variation of the parameter $\\kappa$, which quantifies the presence of suprathermal particles, is not fully captured by such a QL analysis, and typically $\\kappa$ remains constant during plasma dynamics. We propose a new QL modeling that goes beyond the limits of a previous approach, realistically assuming that the quasithermal core cannot evolve independently of energetic suprathermals. The case study is done on the electron-cyclotron (EMEC) instability generated by anisotropic bi-Kappa electrons with $A=T_\\perp/T_\\parallel > 1$ ($\\parallel, \\perp$ denoting directions with respect to the background magnetic field). The parameter $\\kappa$ self-consistently varies through the QL equation of kurtosis (fourth-order moment) coupled with temporal variations of the temperature components, relaxing the constraint on the independence of the low-energy (core) electrons and suprathermal high-energy tails of VDs. The results refine and extend previous approaches. A clear distinction is made between regimes that lead to a decrease or an increase in the $\\kappa$ parameter with saturation of the instability. What predominates is a decrease in $\\kappa$, i.e., an excess of suprathermalization, which energizes suprathermal electrons due to self-generated wave fluctuations. Additionally, we found that VDs can evolve toward a quasi-Maxwellian shape (as $\\kappa$ increases) primarily in regimes with low beta and initial kappa values greater than five. Instability-driven relaxation only partially resolves temperature anisotropy in bi-Kappa electron VDs, as wave fluctuations generally act to further energize suprathermal electrons.",

Wilson 17 pages, 13 figures, 7 tables, accepted for publication in MNRAS Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present the discovery and characterisation of two transiting exoplanets orbiting the metal-poor, solar-type star TOI-5788. From our analysis of six \\textit{TESS} sectors and a dedicated \\textit{CHEOPS} programme, we identify an inner planet (TOI-5788~b; $P = 6.340758\\pm0.000030\\,\\si{\\day}$) with radius $1.528\\pm0.075\\,\\mathrm{R_\\oplus}$ and an outer planet (TOI-5788~c; $P = 16.213362\\pm0.000026\\,\\si{\\day}$) with radius $2.272\\pm0.039\\,\\mathrm{R_\\oplus}$. We obtained 125 radial-velocity spectra from HARPS-N and constrain the masses of TOI-5788~b and~c as $3.72\\pm0.94\\,\\mathrm{M_\\oplus}$ and $6.4\\pm1.2\\,\\mathrm{M_\\oplus}$, respectively. Although dynamical analyses indicate that a third planet could exist in a stable orbit between 8 and 14 days, we find no evidence of additional planets. Since the TOI-5788 system is one of the few systems with planets straddling the radius gap, and noting that there are even fewer such systems around metal poor stars, it is a promising system to constrain planet formation theories. We therefore model the interior structures of both planets. We find that TOI-5788~b is consistent with being a rocky planet with almost no envelope, or having an atmosphere of a high mean molecular weight. We find that TOI-5788~c is consistent with both gas-dwarf and water-world hypotheses of mini-Neptune formation. We model the atmospheric evolution history of both planets. Whilst both scenarios are consistent with the atmospheric evolution of TOI-5788~c, the gas-dwarf model is marginally preferred. The results of the atmospheric evolution analysis are not strongly dependent on stellar evolution. This makes the system a promising target to test internal structure and atmospheric evolution models.",

Sierra-Porta Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Sunspot numbers provide the longest continuous record of solar activity and remain a key index for heliophysical research and space-weather applications. Standard sunspot determination relies on visual inspection and algorithmic feature-detection pipelines, both of which involve methodological choices and can be sensitive to image quality and implementation details. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer an alternative by learning an end-to-end mapping from solar images to a scalar index, reducing reliance on explicit, handcrafted feature design. Here we present a supervised vision-based regression framework to estimate the daily sunspot number from full-disk continuum images acquired by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We pair daily images from 2011-2024 with the SILSO Version 2.0 daily sunspot number and train a CNN to infer the scalar value at the observation time of each image. On an independent test split, the model achieves R2=0.964, RMSE=9.75, and MAE=6.74, indicating close agreement with SILSO across a wide activity range. Interpretability analyses using Grad-CAM and Integrated Gradients show that the network attributions concentrate on sunspot-bearing regions, supporting the physical plausibility of the learned representations. These results demonstrate the feasibility of direct image-to-index estimation for scalable solar monitoring. Future work will explore multimodal fusion with complementary observables (e.g., magnetograms) and standardized cross-cycle benchmarks to assess robustness under changing solar conditions.",

Cranmer, Yuhong Fan, Huw Morgan, Elena Provornikova, Anna Malanushenko, David Webb 49 pages, 26 figures, accepted by Solar Physics Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The ratio of radially to tangentially polarized Thomson-scattered white light provides a powerful tool for locating the 3D position of compact structures in the solar corona and inner heliosphere, and the Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH) has been designed to take full advantage of this diagnostic capability. Interestingly, this same observable that establishes the position of transient blob-like structures becomes a local measure of the slope of the global falloff of density in the background solar wind. It is thus important to characterize the extent along the line of sight of structures being studied, in order to determine whether they are sufficiently compact for 3D positioning. In this paper, we build from analyses of individual lines of sight to three-dimensional models of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), allowing us to consider how accurately polarization properties of the transient and quiescent solar wind are diagnosed. In this way, we demonstrate the challenges and opportunities presented by PUNCH polarization data for various quantitative diagnostics.",

Minor revisions in response to the referee's comments; accepted by MNRAS Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th) Core-collapse supernovae, occurring at the end of massive star evolution, produce heavy elements, including those in the iron peak. Although the explosion mechanism is not yet fully understood, theoretical models can reproduce optical observations and observed elemental abundances. However, many nuclear reaction rates involved in explosive nucleosynthesis have large uncertainties, impacting the reliability of abundance predictions. To address this, we have previously developed a Monte Carlo-based nucleosynthesis code that accounts for reaction rate uncertainties and has been applied to nucleosynthesis processes beyond iron. Our framework is also well suited for studying explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae. In this paper, we investigate 1D explosion models using the \"PUSH method\", focusing on progenitors with varying metallicities and initial masses around $M_\\mathrm{ZAMS} = 16 M_{\\odot}$. Detailed post-process nucleosynthesis calculations and Monte Carlo analyses are used to explore the effects of reaction rate uncertainties and to identify key reaction rates in explosive nucleosynthesis. We find that many reactions have little impact on the production of iron-group nuclei, as these elements are primarily synthesized in the nuclear statistical equilibrium. However, we identify a few \"key reactions\" that significantly influence the production of radioactive nuclei, which may affect astrophysical observables. In particular, for the production of ${}^{44}$Ti, we confirm that several traditionally studied nuclear reactions have a strong impact. However, determining a single reaction rate is insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion.",

O'Grady 5 pages, 2 figures, 1 table; Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) HV 11417 is a candidate Thorne-Żytkow Object, a red supergiant with a neutron star core, located within the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Previous studies have questioned, using Gaia DR2 data, whether HV 11417 was truly located at the distance of the SMC or was instead a foreground star. However, the proper motion measurement uncertainties for HV 11417 in DR2 were high. In this work, we use Gaia DR3 data to show that HV 11417 is very likely to be a true member of the SMC. We further analyze the kinematics of HV 11417 relative to its local environment, and compare it to populations of massive and evolved stars in the SMC. We find HV 11417 has a local transverse velocity of $52\\pm15$ km/s, and thus qualifies as a runaway star (v$_\\mathrm{loc}\\geq$ 30 km/s). This runaway classification does not conclusively prove its nature as a TŻO, particularly given results from recent TŻO models, but does indicate that HV 11417 experienced a kinematic disruption in its evolution.",

The system was identified via periodic variability in Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System light curves of Gaia white dwarf candidates. Follow-up spectroscopy with the Large Lenslet Array Magellan Spectrograph reveals a helium dominated accretion disk, while high speed ULTRACAM photometry shows pronounced primary and secondary eclipses. We construct a decade long orbital timing baseline using ATLAS and Gaia survey photometry together with high speed observations from ULTRACAM on the NTT and proto Lightspeed on the Magellan Clay telescope. From this baseline we measure an orbital period derivative Pdot = -1.60 +/- 0.07 x 10^-12 seconds per second. Interpreted in the context of stable mass transfer, the magnitude and sign of Pdot indicate orbital evolution governed by the interplay between gravitational wave driven angular momentum losses and mass transfer, directly probing the donor star structural response to mass loss. Assuming angular momentum loss dominated by gravitational radiation, we constrain the component masses and infer the characteristic gravitational wave strain. We predict a four year Laser Interferometer Space Antenna signal to noise ratio greater than 10, establishing ATLAS J1013-4516 as a strong prospective space based gravitational wave source that probes long term orbital evolution in the mass transferring regime.",

In the penumbral zones of the planet, spherical symmetry of the star reduces to an axial symmetry. Our work aims to put forward a fundamental explanation, using energy conservation, to determine the variation of irradiance in the penumbral zone on a close-in planet where the point-sized source approximation fails. Consequently, we propose a numerical model that accurately predicts the irradiance within the boundaries of the penumbral zone and the fully-illuminated zone. Our analysis also corrects a previous study on exoplanet irradiation that violates energy conservation. We find that night-side illumination partially explains the observed night-side temperatures on the planets considered; this reduces reliance on heat transport models to explain the night-side temperature for the few exemplar rocky close-in planets, namely K2-141 b, 55 Cancri e, TOI-561 b, TOI-431 b, and Kepler-10 b, that are discussed in this work. We provide improved day-night contrast temperatures, considering an airless scenario, and highlight the need for revisiting the heat transport models associated with atmospheric modelling of planets where the night-side illumination is significant.",

Chen, Davide Manzini Space Physics (physics.space-ph); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) The nature of turbulence at sub-electron scales has remained an open question, central to understanding how electrons are heated in the solar wind. This is primarily because spacecraft measurements have been limited to magnetic field fluctuations alone. We resolve this by deriving new high-resolution density fluctuations from spacecraft potential measurements of Parker Solar Probe resolving scales smaller than the electron gyro-radius ($\\rho_e$). A systematic comparison of the density and magnetic spectra shows that both steepen near the electron scales. Notably, the density spectrum exhibits slopes close to $-10/3$, while the magnetic spectrum becomes consistently steeper than the density spectrum at scales smaller than $\\rho_e$, indicating that the turbulence becomes electrostatic. These results are consistent with theoretical predictions of an electron entropy cascade, which may explain the irreversible dissipation of turbulent energy at sub-$\\rho_e$ scales. The magnetic spectrum, however, is not as steep as expected for the electron entropy cascade, which may be due to limited signal-to-noise ratio and the presence of weakly damped electromagnetic fluctuations near $\\rho_e$.",

(2018)) and REACH (Rigorous Exoplanetary Atmosphere Characterization with High dispersion coronagraphy; Kotani et al. (2020)) on the Subaru Telescope. It is designed to process raw images into one-dimensional spectra in a semi-automatic manner. Unlike traditional methods, it does not rely on IRAF (Tody, 1986; 1993), a software used for astronomical data reduction. This approach simplifies the workflow while maintaining efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, the pipeline includes an updated method for removing readout noise patterns from raw images, enabling efficient extraction of spectra even for faint targets such as brown dwarfs.

Crowther Proceedings of the SPIE, Volume 13599, id. 135990B 16 pp. (2025) Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The DragonCam Microscopic Camera is an instrument being developed for NASA's Dragonfly mission [1] to Saturn's moon Titan. The Microscopic Camera will be body-fixed to the Dragonfly vehicle and will image the surface at a distance of about one meter (98.6 cm nominal) with a pixel scale of better than 60 microns/pixel and a nominal 52 degree angle to the Titan surface. With the 4.8 um pixel pitch of the sensor, this is a focal length of about 77.5 mm. To accommodate range variations due to vehicle pose and surface topography, the Microscopic Camera has a focus mechanism to give it a depth of field (DOF) of about 130mm. Since the Microscopic Camera's boresight is tilted by 52° off the vertical, the optical configuration has a compensating tilted focal plane, taking advantage of the Scheimpflug imaging principle. The optics are all-refractive with nine elements, a six-element stationary group and a three-element moving group. A plano-plano window seals the optics from the environment and also serves as the substrate for a bandpass filter. The optomechanical system is derived from the Mars Hand Lens Imager [11]; the moving group is mounted to a linear slide which is translated via a cam follower by the rotation of a cam driven by a stepper motor. The Microscopic Camera is designed to survive at temperatures as low as -130C without power. The camera is enclosed in a cavity in the foam insulation covering the spacecraft and looking through a single-pane window. Prior to imaging, the camera will be heated to operating temperature (nominal -30C) for proper actuation of the mechanism. STOP analysis has been performed to demonstrate that optical performance is maintained after heating. Software focus merging will be performed in the onboard camera control electronics to minimize image data downlink requirements.",

This paper presents an overview of the R2Pub telescope system, including its design, instrumentation, and survey capabilities, and reports an initial evaluation of its system performance. R2Pub is a prime-focus binocular system, with each optical tube covering a field of view of approximately 18 square degrees. It is designed to detect a wide range of transient and variable sources in the local universe, such as variable stars, eclipsing binaries, supernovae, gamma-ray burst afterglows, tidal disruption events, active galactic nuclei, and other unknown transients. The observatory infrastructure, including the dome, equatorial mount, optical tubes, and associated subsystems, has been fully constructed and installed, and the system has entered the commissioning phase. Benefiting from the high-altitude location, good seeing conditions, and dark sky background at the Daocheng site, performance tests during commissioning show that the R2Pub system can reach a 5-sigma limiting magnitude of about 18.7 mag in the Pan-STARRS r' band with a 60 s exposure. Ongoing observations with R2Pub are expected to contribute to studies of variable and transient phenomena and to enhance public outreach in astronomy. The binocular design enables simultaneous dual-band observations, providing instantaneous color information for transient sources and improving the classification and physical characterization of their properties and evolution.",

Ventura, Kshitij Thorat, Anna Bosman, Roger Deane, Christopher Cleghorn 12 pages, 14 figures, submitted to RAS Techniques and Instruments Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We present a novel application of Vector quantised variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) to deep 1.28 GHz radio continuum images taken from the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey (MGCLS).VQ-VAEs are deep learning models widely used in modern computer vision applications and pipelines. Designed for image generation, VQ-VAEs are trained to reconstruct the input dataset via a low-dimensional discrete embedding. VQ-VAEs effectively learn the distribution of training data, where samples that do not fit the distribution well yield the highest reconstruction errors. This property makes VQ-VAEs a good candidate for the task of anomaly detection. In this work, we examine the effectiveness of VQ-VAEs in identifying radio continuum sources with anomalous structures in the image-plane domain. We find VQ-VAEs to be useful as part of a solution for searching such large datasets. We observe that they are able to remove a majority of the typical sources in such data, even when trained in an unsupervised manner on unlabelled data. We also provide our testing set of a large sample of manually labelled radio sources, in particular radio galaxies, taken from the MGCLS at 1.28 GHz. Automated approaches to searching through high volumes of data are key in extracting the full scientific potential of the Square Kilometre Array and its pathfinders.",

P. 504-528 Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) This work develops low-energy spacecraft (SC) trajectories using Venus gravity assists to study asteroids during heliocentric transfer segments between planetary encounters. The study focuses on potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) as primary exploration targets. This paper proposes a method for calculating SC trajectories that enable asteroid flybys after a Venus gravity assist. The method involves formulating and solving an optimization problem to design trajectories incorporating flybys of selected asteroids and Venus. Trajectories are calculated using two-body dynamics by solving the Lambert problem. A preliminary search for candidate asteroids uses an algorithm to narrow the search space of the optimization problem. This algorithm uses the V-infinity globe technique to connect planetary gravity assists with resonant orbits. The resonant orbit in this case serves as an initial approximation for the SC's trajectory between two successive planetary flybys. Four flight schemes were analyzed, including multiple flybys of Venus and asteroids, with the possibility of an SC returning to Earth. The proposed solutions reduce flight time between asteroid approaches, increase gravity assist frequency, and enhance mission design flexibility. The use of Venus gravity assists and resonant orbits ensures a close encounter with at least one asteroid during the SC's trajectory between two consecutive flybys of Venus, and demonstrates the feasibility of periodic Venus gravity assists and encounters with PHAs. The developed method was applied to construct trajectories that allow an SC to approach both Venus-resonant asteroids and PHAs via multiple Venus gravity assists. An additional study was carried out to identify asteroids accessible during the Earth-Venus segment in launch windows between 2029 and 2050.",

The software uses the method of systematic ranging to perform orbit determination on tracklets in the Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page (NEOCP), which typically have short observational arcs. Fitted orbits are propagated to determine the likelihood of an impact with Earth. In addition, magnitude fitting and Monte Carlo sampling are performed to estimate the object's size, possible impact locations and times, and suggest a best telescope pointing for object follow-up. A set of object scores are produced from computed posterior probabilities across the grid, giving a statistical description of the object's orbital and physical characteristics. The scores are packaged with several informative plots in an email alert, which is sent to Meerkat subscribers in the event of a significant impact probability, close approach, or other scientifically interesting event. The highlights of the five years of Meerkat's operational service are presented, including the successful warnings for all of the past six imminent impactors discovered before impact and several interesting close approaches.",

Despite promising innovations, existing resources are often poorly documented, designed for one-time events, expensive, and lack interdisciplinary collaboration, user testing, and broad dissemination. AMACA addresses these challenges by creating multi-sensory activities for education and outreach, with a particular focus on accessibility for people with sensory disabilities. A circular approach informs its educational structure: (1) a PhD course on multi-sensory astronomy outreach develops hands-on activities with the support of astronomers, psychologists, and organizations for the visually impaired and the deaf; (2) PhD candidates teach High School (HS) students how to deliver the activities; (3) HS students lead the activities at the Astronomy Festival \"The Universe in All Senses\"; (4) HS students train teachers to implement the activities in their classrooms. AMACA also develops tools to guide project development and track participants' learning. Key findings show improved communication and accessibility awareness among PhD candidates, increased emotional engagement with astronomy among HS students, enhanced public engagement with research and accessibility awareness, and high teacher satisfaction with the flipped-roles, hands-on approach. Overall, AMACA enhances accessibility and engagement in astronomy education across audiences.",

AAFIYA is validated using measurements from an electromagnetic anechoic chamber involving Log Periodic Dipole Array (LPDA) reference antennas and Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) Bottom Vertically Polarized antennas over 100-850 MHz. Extracted metrics, including impedance matching, realized gain patterns, vector effective lengths, and cross-polarization ratio, are compared against full-wave simulations from HFSS and WIPL-D, showing good agreement across frequency and angle.

Here, we explore using Gaussian Process (GP) regression with Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry in modeling radial velocities (RVs) to help to mitigate stellar jitter from oscillations and granulation for exoplanet detection. We applied GP regression to simultaneous TESS photometric and RV data of HD 5562, a G-type subgiant ($M_\\star=1.09M_{\\odot}$, $R_\\star=1.88R_{\\odot}$) with a V magnitude of 7.17, using photometry to inform the priors for RV fitting. The RV data is obtained by the Magellan Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS). The photometry-informed GP regression reduced the RV scatter of HD~5562 from 2.03 to 0.51 m/s. We performed injection and recovery tests to evaluate the potential of GPs for discovering small exoplanets around evolved stars, which demonstrate that the GP provides comparable noise reduction to the binning method. We also found that the necessity of photometric data depends on the quality of the RV dataset. For long baseline and high-cadence RV observations, GP regression can effectively mitigate stellar jitter without photometric data. However, for intermittent RV observations, incorporating photometric data improves GP fitting and enhances detection capabilities.",

Voyer, Quentin Changeat Accepted for publication after review in A&A. 7 pages, 5 figures Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The unprecedented wavelength coverage and sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) permits to measure the absorption features of a wide range of condensate species from Silicates to Titan tholins. Atmospheric retrievals are uniquely suited to analyse these datasets and characterize the aerosols present in exoplanet atmospheres. However, including the optical properties of condensed particles within retrieval frameworks remains computationally expensive, limiting our ability to fully exploit JWST observations. In this work, we improve the computational efficiency and scaling behavior of aerosol models in atmospheric retrievals, enabling in-depth studies including multiple condensate species within practical time scales. Rather than computing the aerosol Mie coefficients for each sampled model, we pre-compute extinction efficiency (Qext), scattering efficiency (Qscat) and asymmetry parameter (g) grids for seven condensate species relevant in exoplanet atmospheres (Mg2SiO4 amorph sol - gel, MgSiO3 amorph glass, MgSiO3 amorph sol - gel, SiO2 alpha, SiO2 amorph, SiO and Titan tholins). The pre-computed Qext grids significantly reduce computation time between 1.4 and 17 times with negligible differences on the retrieved parameters. They also scale effortlessly with the number of aerosol species while maintaining the accuracy of cloud models. Thereby enabling more complex retrievals as well as broader population studies without increasing the overall error budget. The Qext, Qscat and g grids are freely available on Zenodo as well as a public TauREx plugin -TauREx-PCQ- that utilize them.",

A major challenge in SETI is the effective mitigation of radio frequency interference (RFI), a critical step that is particularly vital for the highly sensitive Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). While initial RFI mitigation (e.g., removal of persistent and drifting narrowband RFI) are essential, residual RFI often persists, posing significant challenges due to its complex and various nature. In this paper, we propose and apply an improved machine learning approach, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, to identify and mitigate residual RFI in FAST-SETI commensal survey archival data from July 2019. After initial RFI mitigation, we successfully identify and remove 36977 residual RFIs (accounting for $\\sim$ 77.87\\%) within approximately 1.678 seconds using the DBSCAN algorithm. This result shows that we have achieved a 7.44\\% higher removal rate than previous machine learning methods, along with a 24.85\\% reduction in execution time. We finally find interesting candidate signals consistent with previous studies, and retain one candidate signal following further analysis. Therefore, DBSCAN algorithm can mitigate more residual RFI with higher computational efficiency while preserving the candidate signals that we are interested in.",

Grogin Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Recent analysis of 23 years of Hubble Space Telescope ACS/SBC data has shown that background levels can vary considerably between observations, with most filters showing over an order of magnitude variation. For the shorter-wavelength filters, the background is understood to be dominated by airglow; however, what precisely drives background variations is not well constrained for any filter. Here, we explore the causes of the background variation. Using over 8,000 archival SBC observations, we developed a machine learning model that can accurately predict the background for an observation, based upon a set of 23 observational parameters. This model indicates that, depending on filter, the SBC background is generally dominated by Solar elevation, Solar separation angle, Earth limb angle of observation, SBC temperature, and target Galactic latitude.",

Trivedi Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Machine Learning (cs.LG) The development of novel instrumentation requires an iterative cycle with three stages: design, prototyping, and testing. Recent advancements in simulation and nanofabrication techniques have significantly accelerated the design and prototyping phases. Nonetheless, detector characterization continues to be a major bottleneck in device development. During the testing phase, a significant time investment is required to characterize the device in different operating conditions and find optimal operating parameters. The total effort spent on characterization and parameter optimization can occupy a year or more of an expert's time. In this work, we present a novel technique for automated sensor characterization that aims to accelerate the testing stage of the development cycle. This technique leverages closed-loop Bayesian optimization (BO), using real-time measurements to guide parameter selection and identify optimal operating states. We demonstrate the method with a novel low-noise CCD, showing that the machine learning-driven tool can efficiently characterize and optimize operation of the sensor in a couple of days without supervision of a device expert.",

Our database comprises 43 878 measurements in the u, g, r, i, z, and J filters, from which we derived 8 738 phase curves for 1 921 unique objects. From these data, we computed 12 852 absolute color measurements and spectral slope differences for 1 761 objects, allowing a statistical characterization of phase coloring effects. The colors show no strong bimodality or correlation with orbital parameters, emphasizing the importance of phase correction even for small phase angles. The increase in sample size and application of phase corrections fill previously empty regions in color magnitude space likely affected by observational biases, as redder (and thus darker) objects are preferentially lost near detection limits. Notably, our dataset includes the first photometric measurements from Rubin Observatory during RFL, covering eight objects (five newly discovered TNOs and three previously known). These early LSST observations occupy sparsely sampled regions of parameter space, particularly at faint magnitudes, highlighting the discovery and characterization potential of the full survey. We confirm previous results showing that TNO colors vary with phase angle, exhibiting both reddening and bluening trends. Correlations between (dS'/dalpha) and (alpha) strengthen with increasing (Delta lambda), except for Hi - Hz, which tends to neutralize, consistent with the spectral flattening previously reported in visible wavelengths.",

Wallack, Nicholas Wogan Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) JWST has already observed near-infrared transmission spectra of over a dozen super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. While some observations have allowed astronomers to characterize sub-Neptunes in unprecedented detail, small feature amplitudes and poorly-understood systematics have led to ambiguous results for others. Using the first seven targets from the COMPASS program, which is currently surveying 12 small planet atmospheres using NIRSpec/G395H, we investigate these timeseries systematics. We implement a model that uses the principle components of the normalized pixel fluxes to account for variations in the shape and position of the spectral trace. We find that observations with a smaller number of groups-per-integration benefit most profoundly from the use of this model, and that systematics are particularly strong between 2.8 and 3.5 $\\mu$m. Despite these systematics, \\texttt{pandexo} is a relatively accurate predictor of the precision of the spectra, with real error bars on average 5\\% larger in NRS1 and 12\\% larger in NRS2 than predicted. We compute new limits on metallicity and opaque pressure level for each target and compare these to previous results from the COMPASS program. Next, we co-add spectra from multiple targets to reduce the effective noise in the combined spectra in hopes of detecting transmission features in common between the targets, but this exercise does not yield compelling evidence any signals. We find that a handful of additional transits are sufficient to break the degeneracy between metallicity and aerosols for the majority of our targets, pointing towards the possibility of unraveling the mysteries of these worlds with future allocations of JWST time.",

Feedback is appreciated before 01/23/2025 Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We investigate the orbital dynamics of four-planet systems consisting of Earth-mass planets on initially-circular, coplanar orbits around a star of one solar mass. In our simulations, the innermost planet's semimajor axis is set at 1 AU, with subsequent semimajor axes spaced equally in terms of planets' mutual Hill radii. Several sets of initial planetary longitudes are investigated, with integrations continuing for up to $10^{10}$ orbits of the innermost planet, stopping if a pair of planets pass within 0.01 AU of each other or if a planet is ejected from the system. We find that the simulated lifetimes of four-planet systems follow the general trend of increasing exponentially with planetary spacing, as seen by previous studies of closely-spaced planets. Four-planet system lifetimes are intermediate between those of three- and five-planet systems and more similar to the latter. Moreover, as with five-planet systems, but in marked contrast to the three-planet case, no initial semimajor axes spacings are found to yield systems that survive several orders of magnitude longer than other similar spacings. First- and second-order mean-motion resonances (MMRs) between planets correlate with reductions in system lifetimes. Additionally, we find that third-order MMRs between planets on neighboring orbits also have a substantial, though smaller, destabilizing effect on systems very near resonance that otherwise would be very long-lived. Local extrema of system lifetimes as a function of planetary spacing occur at slightly smaller initial orbital separation for systems with planets initially at conjunction relative to those in which the planets begin on widely-separated longitudes. This shift is produced by the asymmetric mutual planetary perturbations as the planets separate in longitude from the initial aligned configuration that cause orbits to spread out in semimajor axis.",

Published in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The outer regions of planetary systems host dusty debris discs analogous to the Kuiper belt (exoKuiper belts), which provide crucial constraints on planet formation and evolution processes. ALMA dust observations have revealed a great diversity, and that some belts contain CO gas, whose origin and implications are uncertain. Most of this progress, however, has been limited by low-resolution observations. We conducted the first ALMA large programme dedicated to debris discs: the ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS). We selected the 24 most promising belts to constrain their detailed radial and vertical structure, and to characterise the gas content. We constrained the radial and vertical distribution of dust, as well as the presence of asymmetries. For a subset of six belts with CO gas, we constrained the gas distribution and kinematics. To interpret these observations, we used a wide range of dynamical models. The first ARKS results are presented as a series of ten papers. We discovered that up to 33% of our sample exhibits multiple dusty rings. For highly inclined belts, we found that non-Gaussian vertical distributions are common and are indicative of multiple dynamical populations. We also found that 10 of the 24 belts present asymmetries. We find that the CO gas is radially broader than the dust, but this could be an effect of optical depth. At least one system shows non-Keplerian kinematics due to strong pressure gradients, which may have triggered a vortex that trapped dust in an arc. Finally, we find evidence that the micron-sized grains may be affected by gas drag in gas rich systems. ARKS has revealed a great diversity of structures in exoKuiper belts that may arise when they are formed in protoplanetary discs or subsequently via interactions with planets and/or gas. We encourage the community to explore the reduced data and data products.",

Recent CO detections show that gas is present, but its abundance and origin remain uncertain. The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) revealed a narrow gas and dust ring in the disc HD 121617 with an asymmetric arc 40% brighter than the rest of the ring. We aim to constrain the total gas mass in HD 121617 assuming the dust arc is produced by hydrodynamical gas-dust interactions. We used the Dusty FARGO-ADSG code, modelling dust as Lagrangian particles, including radiation pressure and dust feedback, and varying the total gas mass. Simulations were compared to observations using radiative transfer. An unstable gas ring creates a size-dependent radial and azimuthal dust trap whose efficiency depends on gas mass. Two models, with 50 and 5 Earth masses of gas, reproduce both the ALMA band 7 arc and the outward offset of the VLT/SPHERE scattered-light ring via gas drag and radiation pressure. We infer a conservative gas-mass range of 2.5 to 250 Earth masses. If the ALMA asymmetry is caused by gas drag, the required gas mass compared with the observed CO implies substantial H2, consistent with primordial gas. HD 121617 would then be a hybrid disc between protoplanetary and debris stages. Since a planet could also create an arc, future observations are needed to distinguish these scenarios.",

Zawadzki Paper VIII in the ARKS series, presenting a detailed analysis of HD121617's dust and gas distribution and kinematics. Published in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) ExoKuiper belts around young A-type stars often host CO gas, whose origin is still unclear. The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) includes 6 of these gas-bearing belts, to characterise their dust and gas distributions and investigate the gas origin. As part of ARKS, we observed the gas-rich system HD121617 and discovered an arc of enhanced dust density. In this paper, we analyse in detail the dust and gas distributions and the gas kinematics of this system. We extracted radial and azimuthal profiles of the dust (in the millimetre and near-infrared) and gas emission ($^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO) from reconstructed images. To constrain the morphology of the arc, we fitted an asymmetric model to the dust emission. To characterise the gas kinematics, we fitted a Keplerian model to the velocity map and extracted the azimuthal velocity profile by deprojecting the data. We find that the dust arc is narrow (1-5 au wide at a radius of 75 au), azimuthally extended, and asymmetric; the emission is more azimuthally compact in the direction of the system's rotation, and represents 13% of the total dust mass (0.2$M_\\oplus$). The arc is much less pronounced or absent for small grains and gas. Finally, we find strong non-Keplerian azimuthal velocities at the inner and outer wings of the ring, as was expected due to strong pressure gradients. The dust arc resembles the asymmetries found in protoplanetary discs, often interpreted as the result of dust trapping in vortices. If the gas disc mass is high enough ($\\gtrsim20M_\\oplus$, requiring a primordial gas origin), both the radial confinement of the ring and the azimuthal arc may result from dust grains responding to gas drag. Alternatively, it could result from planet-disc interactions via mean motion resonances. Further studies should test these hypotheses and may provide a dynamical gas mass estimate in this CO-rich exoKuiper belt.",

Abstract abridged to satisfy arXiv requirements Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Dusty discs detected around main-sequence stars are thought to be signs of planetesimal belts in which the dust distribution is shaped by collisional and dynamical processes, including interactions with gas if present. The debris disc around the young A-type star HD 131835 is composed of two dust rings at ~65 au and ~100 au, a third unconstrained innermost component, and a gaseous component centred at ~65 au. New ALMA observations show that the inner of the two dust rings is brighter than the outer one, in contrast with previous observations in scattered light. We explore two scenarios that could explain these observations: the two dust rings might represent distinct planetesimal belts with different collisional properties, or only the inner ring might contain planetesimals while the outer ring consists entirely of dust that has migrated outwards due to gas drag. To explore the first scenario, we employed a state-of-the-art collisional evolution code. To test the second scenario, we used a simple dynamical model of dust grain evolution in an optically thin gaseous disc. Collisional models of two planetesimal belts cannot fully reproduce the observations by only varying their dynamical excitation, and matching the data through a different material strength requires an extreme difference in dust composition. The gas-driven scenario can reproduce the location of the outer ring and the brightness ratio of the two rings from scattered light observations, but the resulting outer ring is too faint overall in both scattered light and sub-millimetre emission. The dust rings in HD 131835 could be produced from two planetesimal belts, although how these belts would attain the required extremely different properties needs to be explained. The dust-gas interaction is a plausible alternative explanation and deserves further study using a more comprehensive model.",

Weber Accepted for publication in A&A. 24 pages, inc. 7 page appendix Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Asymmetries in debris discs provide unique clues to understand the evolution and architecture of planetary systems.** The aim of the ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) is to expand our understanding of radial and vertical dust structures, as well as gas distributions and kinematics, in debris discs.** Here, in ARKS~VI, we present a systematic analysis of the asymmetries and stellocentric offsets present in the ALMA continuum data for the ARKS survey. Our aims are to identify asymmetries in debris disc dust distributions, quantify debris disc asymmetry properties, and discuss the potential origins of debris disc asymmetries.** We utilised empirical methods to identify emission asymmetries** and the presence of offset emission between disc centres and the locations of the host stars, via an analysis of their calibration procedures and disc properties. We associated observational asymmetry types** and plausible physical classes** associated with each source. We show that there are ten systems, almost half of the ARKS sample, that host either a continuum emission asymmetry or offset emission. Three systems host offsets (HD15115, HD32297, and HD109573 (HR4796)), four host azimuthal asymmetries (HD9672 (49Ceti), HD92945, HD107146, and HD121617), two host an asymmetry in their major axis (HD10647 (q$^1$ Eri), and HD39060 ($\\beta$ Pic)), and one hosts an asymmetry in their minor axis (HD61005). We attribute the offset asymmetries to non-zero eccentricities, and three of the azimuthal asymmetries to arcs. The presence of an asymmetry or offset in the ARKS sample appears to be correlated with the fractional luminosity of cold dust.** Conclusions: This study demonstrates that debris disc asymmetries in the ARKS sample are common, and plausibly so in the wider population of debris discs at (sub)-millimetre wavelengths.** ** = ABRIDGED FOR ARXIV: FULL ABSTRACT IN PAPER",

Lis Accepted for publication in AJ. 21 pages, 15 figures Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Long-period comets, which are often considered to be representative of material in the protoplanetary disk that formed the Solar System, are ideal to investigate the question of chemical inheritance in astronomy. Determining the chemistry of comets, both individually and as a population, has become of great importance in comparative studies against sources representative of evolutionary precursors to planetary systems. Contemporaneous observations of long-period comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) were obtained with the JWST and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in early 2023 March. This work focuses on \\ce{CH3OH} measurements from both ALMA and JWST as well as \\ce{H2O} measurements from JWST. Radiative transfer modeling of \\ce{CH3OH} and \\ce{H2O} was performed to investigate spatial variations in rotational temperature, column density, and production rates, as well as a comparison of derived values between the two telescopes. Most of the spatial distributions of the modeled values are centrally peaked, and the modeled values from JWST are all within the error bars of the average values from ALMA. C/2022 E3 (ZTF) also displays an enhancement in modeled rotational temperature in the anti-Sunward direction that is shown to be statistically significant. Based on non-LTE radiative transfer modeling, the declining \\ce{H2O} rotational temperatures as a function of nucleocentric distance observed by JWST can be explained primarily as a result of rotational line cooling. The values derived in this work are in general agreement with single-dish millimeter-wave observations.",

Chiang 21 pages, 21 figures, to be published in Astronomy and Astrophysics (A&A) Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) CO gas has been detected in $\\sim$20 debris discs. We present ALMA observations of the CO-rich HD 121617 debris disc from the ARKS survey. Using high-resolution Band 7 observations of $^{12}CO \\ J=3-2$, we analyse local CO line profiles to investigate optical depth, CO mass, and temperature. Spectra are aligned and stacked in concentric annuli to produce local line profiles. The resulting profiles are Gaussian-shaped and broadened by Keplerian shear. The line profiles are modelled using both a simplified toy model and a RADMC-3D model including projection effects and Keplerian shear. Fitting the RADMC-3D model to the $^{13}$CO data, we find that an optically thick model with a temperature of 38 K and a CO mass of $2 \\times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\\oplus}$ reproduces the observations. The model reproduces the enhanced emission at orbital azimuths of $\\sim \\pm45^{\\circ}$ and $\\pm135^{\\circ}$, forming an X-shaped structure in the velocity-integrated intensity map, as well as the broader $^{12}$CO linewidth relative to $^{13}$CO. Scaling the model by the ISM abundance ratio ($\\sim$77) also reproduces the $^{12}$CO data, though high optical depths and model assumptions limit mass constraints. We find that azimuthally averaged local line profiles appear Gaussian regardless of optical depth, cautioning against their use for distinguishing optically thin and thick emission. We constrain the mean molecular weight to $12.6_{-1.1}^{+1.3}$, dependent on model assumptions. Our $^{13}$CO results suggest that C$^{18}$O may also be optically thick in CO-rich debris discs and that the mean molecular weight is significantly higher than if H$_2$ were the dominant gas species, suggesting a non-primordial composition.",

To achieve these purposes, the global maps of escape trajectories are constructed, and escape trajectories with one lunar gravity assist are pre-filtered. Then, an effective method to identification escape families is proposed based on dynamical analysis and data mining techniques. Once the escape families are identified, the corresponding characteristics are analyzed to provide insights into the construction of escape trajectories. Based on these escape families, the effects of the solar gravity perturbation on the number of escape trajectories, the emergence and disappearance of escape families, variation in generalized energy, and transfer characteristics are further summarized, providing insights into the model selection in the escape trajectory construction. This paper establishes an analysis methodology of escape trajectories from a perspective of escape families, deepening the understanding of escape dynamics.",

Putra 29 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in Few Body Systems Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) This study examines the dynamics of the third body in an elliptic restricted three-body problem (ERTBP) framework, taking into account perturbations from radiation pressure, oblateness, and elongation of the primary bodies, as well as disk-like structures. The objectives are to determine the positions and stability of the equilibrium points, asses how these points shift under the influence of perturbations, and evaluate the dependence of their stability on the orbital eccentricity and perturbation parameters. The ERTBP model is modified to include a radiating, oblate primary body and an elongated secondary body modeled as a finite straight segment, alongside perturbations from a surrounding disk. The system's equations of motion are numerically solved using parameters from perturbed and classical cases. Equilibrium positions are computed over a range of eccentricities and perturbation values, and stability is analyzed using linearized equations and eigenvalue methods. In all cases, we have found three collinear ($L_1$, $L_2$, $L_3$) and two non-collinear ($L_4$, $L_5$) equilibrium points solutions. The inclusion of radiations, oblateness, elongation using a finite straight segment, and disk perturbation systematically displaces each equilibrium point from its classical location, with the magnitude and direction of the displacement varying with the perturbation parameter. Stability analysis confirms that the collinear points remain linearly stable under all tested conditions. Meanwhile, non-collinear points are stable under a specific condition. We investigate the stability boundary of these points as a function of orbital eccentricity and we found there is a critical range of eccentricity values within which stability is preserved.",

      "abstract": "Interior dynamics of envelopes around disk-embedded planets Ayumu Kuwahara, Michiel Lambrechts 16 pages, 20 figures, Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics (A&A) Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) In the core accretion scenario, forming planets start to acquire gaseous envelopes while accreting solids. Conventional one-dimensional models assume envelopes to be static and isolated. However, recent three-dimensional simulations demonstrate dynamic gas exchange from the envelope to the surrounding disk. This process is controlled by the balance between heating, through the accretion of solids, and cooling, which is regulated by poorly-known opacities. In this work, we systemically investigate a wide range of cooling and heating rates, using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. We identify three distinct cooling regimes. Fast-cooling envelopes ($\\beta \\lesssim 1$, with $\\beta$ the cooling time in units of orbital time) are nearly isothermal and have inner radiative layers that are shielded from recycling flows. In contrast, slow cooling envelopes ($\\beta\\gtrsim10^3$) become fully convective. In the intermediate regime ($1\\lesssim\\beta\\lesssim300$), envelopes are characterized by a three-layer structure, comprising an inner convective, a middle radiative, and an outer recycling layer. The development of this radiative layer traps small dust and vapour released from sublimated species. In contrast, fully convective envelopes efficiently exchange material from inner to outer envelope. Such fully convective envelopes are likely to emerge in the inner parts of protoplanetary disks ($\\lesssim$ 1 au) where cooling times are long, implying that inner-disk super-Earths may see their growth stalled and be volatile depleted.",

Wyatt 31 pages, 12 figures, published in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Debris disks -- collisionally sustained belts of dust and sometimes gas around main sequence stars -- are remnants of planet formation processes and are found in systems ${\\gtrsim}10$ Myr old. Millimeter-wavelength observations are particularly important, as the grains probed by these observations are not strongly affected by radiation pressure and stellar winds, allowing them to probe the dynamics of large bodies producing dust. The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) is analyzing high-resolution observations of 24 debris disks to enable the characterization of debris disk substructures across a large sample for the first time. For the most highly inclined disks, it is possible to recover the vertical structure of the disk. We aim to model and analyze the most highly inclined systems in the ARKS sample in order to uniformly extract the vertical dust distributions for a sample of well-resolved debris disks. We employed both parametric and nonparametric methods to constrain the vertical dust distributions for the most highly inclined ARKS targets. We find a broad range of aspect ratios, revealing a wide diversity in vertical structure, with a range of best-fit parametric values of $0.0026 \\leq h_{\\rm HWHM} \\leq 0.193$ and a median best-fit value of $h_{\\rm HWHM}=0.021$. The results obtained by nonparametric modeling are generally consistent with the parametric modeling results. We find that five of the 13 disks are consistent with having total disk masses less than that of Neptune (17 $M_{\\oplus}$), assuming stirring by internal processes (self-stirring and collisional and frictional damping). Furthermore, most systems show a significant preference for a Lorentzian vertical profile rather than a Gaussian.",

We employ a viscous alpha-disk prescription and include a time-dependent energy equation to compute the disk's effective temperature and subsequently derive the bolometric and multi-band photometric light this http URL simulations show that planetary TDEs produce a diverse range of luminous transients. A Jupiter-like planet disrupted from a circular orbit at the Roche limit generates a transient peaking at $L_{bol} \\approx 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ after a 12-day rise. In contrast, the same planet on an eccentric orbit (e=0.5) produces a transient of comparable peak luminosity but on a much shorter timescale, peaking in only 1 day and followed by a highly volatile light curve. We find that the effect of eccentricity is not universal, as it accelerates the event for Jupiter but delays it for Neptune. A robust \"bluer-when-brighter\" colour evolution is a common feature as the disk cools over its multi-year lifetime. The strong dependence of light curve morphology on the initial orbit and progenitor mass makes these events powerful diagnostics. This framework is crucial for identifying planetary TDEs in time-domain surveys.",

      "abstract": "Analytic Modeling of Tidally Locked Rocky Planet Atmospheres Across Dynamical Regimes Christopher P. Wirth, Diana Powell, Robin Wordsworth Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We present a new first-principles analytic approach to interpreting eclipses and phase curves of rocky planets. Observations with JWST have reported nondetections of atmospheres around the majority of hot rocky planets orbiting M dwarfs. However, most of these \"bare rock\" inferences are based on models that are ill-suited to many currently observable planets, as they were developed for use on cooler, slower-rotating bodies. In particular, these models rely on the weak temperature gradient assumption, in which rotation is neglected and temperature gradients can be simply related to wind speeds. We find that this assumption may not be valid for over 40% of terrestrials observed with JWST, including TRAPPIST-1b, GJ 367b, and TOI-2445b. Our simple new four-box model does not rely on this assumption, and instead allows the heat transport efficiency to be specified or follow scalings derived herein. This method is fast, interpretable, physically motivated, reproduces previous general circulation model results, and can be used as a starting point for more detailed modeling. We observe that the longitudinal temperature structure of tidally locked terrestrials depends strongly on the atmospheric circulation. Considering the applicable range of atmospheric dynamical regimes, we find that a given planet's nightside temperature can plausibly vary by 100s of Kelvin (from detectable to undetectable). Furthermore, a planet's dayside energy balance can display complex behavior, with degeneracies between surface pressure and dayside temperature. Illustrating an application to observations, we find that assumptions about atmospheric dynamics and longitudinal temperature structure can bias atmospheric constraints at the order-of-magnitude level.",

Special Issue: Birthplaces of Planets in Their Earliest Stages: Towards Characterization of Young Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Knowing the masses and sizes of protoplanetary disks is of fundamental importance for the contemporary theories of planet formation. However, their measurements are associated with large uncertainties. In this proof of concept study, we focus on the very early stages of disk evolution, concurrent with the formation of the protostellar seed, because it is then that the initial conditions for subsequent planet formation are likely established. Using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a protoplanetary disk followed by radiation transfer postprocessing, we constructed synthetic disk images at millimeter wavelengths. We then calculated the synthetic disk radii and masses using an algorithm that is often applied to observations of protoplanetary disks with ALMA, and compared the resulting values with the actual disk mass and size derived directly from hydrodynamic modeling. We paid specific attention to the effects of dust growth on the discrepancy between synthetic and intrinsic disk masses and radii. We find that the dust mass is likely underestimated in Band 6 by factors of 1.4-4.2 when Ossenkopf & Henning opacities and typical dust temperatures are used, but the discrepancy reduces in Band~3, where the dust mass can be even overestimated. Dust growth affects both disk mass and size estimates via the dust-size-dependent opacity, and extremely low values of dust temperature (~ several Kelvin) are required to recover the intrinsic dust mass when dust has grown to mm-sized grains and its opacity has increased. Dust mass estimates are weakly sensitive to the distance to the source, while disk radii may be seriously affected. We conclude that the accuracy of measuring the dust mass and disk radius during the formation of a protoplanetary disk also depends on the progress in dust growth. (Abridged)",

Wyatt Astronomy & Astrophysics, 2024, 705, A199 Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Debris discs are analogues to our own Kuiper belt around main-sequence stars and are therefore referred to as exoKuiper belts. They have been resolved at high angular resolution at wavelengths spanning the optical to the submillimetre-millimetre regime. Short wavelengths probe the light scattered by such discs, which is dominated by micron-sized dust particles, while millimetre wavelengths probe the thermal emission of millimetre-sized particles. Determining differences in the dust distribution between millimetre- and micron-sized dust is fundamental to revealing the dynamical processes affecting the dust in debris discs. We aim to compare the scattered light from the discs of the ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) with the thermal emission probed by ALMA. We focus on the radial distribution of the dust. We used high-contrast scattered light observations obtained with VLT/SPHERE, GPI, and the HST to uniformly study the dust distribution in those systems and compare it to the dust distribution extracted from the ALMA observations carried out in the course of the ARKS project. We also set constraints on the presence of planets by using these high-contrast images combined with exoplanet evolutionary models. 15 of the 24 discs comprising the ARKS sample are detected in scattered light, with TYC9340-437-1 being imaged for the first time at near-infrared wavelengths. For 6 of those 15 discs, the dust surface density seen in scattered light peaks farther out compared to that observed with ALMA. These 6 discs except one are known to also host cold CO gas. Conversely, the systems without significant offsets are not known to host gas, except one. This observational study suggests that the presence of gas in debris discs may affect the small and large grains differently, pushing the small dust to greater distances where the gas is less abundant.",

We aim to observationally trace the rotational evolution of main-belt asteroid families over Gyr timescales. We analyzed rotational properties of 8739 asteroids with spin period measurements and 3794 asteroids with obliquity determinations across 28 asteroid families spanning ages from 14~Myrs to 3~Gyrs. We introduced a dimensionless timescale that normalizes each asteroid's family age by its classical YORP timescale, enabling direct comparison of rotational states across different evolutionary stages. We examined two key observables: the fraction of slow rotators (periods greater than or equal to 30 hours) and the polarization fraction (the degree to which asteroid spin poles align correctly with their position in the family's V-shape distribution according to the Yarkovsky theory). Evolution of both quantities were fitted to identify characteristic transition timescales. We discovered that the slow-rotator fraction increases steeply with $t$ and saturates at $f_{\\rm slow} \\simeq 0.25$ around a breakpoint $t_{\\rm bp} \\simeq 20$. This implies a stochastic YORP timescale $\\tau_{\\rm YORP,stoc} \\simeq 10\\,\\tau_{\\rm YORP}$ by comparison with rotational evolution models that include tumbling and weakened YORP torques. The polarization fraction reaches a maximum of $\\simeq 0.8$ at $t \\simeq 16$ and then decays toward the random limit $f_{\\rm pol} \\rightarrow 0.5$ for $t \\gtrsim 20$, indicating an increasing dominance of collisional spin reorientation over time.

Because exoplanet interiors cannot be directly observed, their make-up must be inferred from mass-radius-composition models that link assumed stellar abundances to the direct observables: planetary mass and radius. There are a variety of such models in the literature, each adopting different equations of state (EOS) to describe the materials' properties at depth and varying assumptions about the minerals present within the planets. These EOS+mineral suites provide the foundations for compositional inferences, but they have not yet been systematically compared. In this work, we review several suites, with a detailed description of the basic structure, mineral physics, and materials within standard small planet models. We show that EOS+mineral suites predict planet densities whose differences are comparable to current observational uncertainties, which present a challenge for robustly interpreting and classifying small planets. We apply a powerful small-planet characterization framework, which illustrates that variations among EOS+mineral suites lead to inconsistent conclusions for both individual planets and sample-level demographics. Our results demonstrate the need for more careful considerations of the materials and EOS used in mass-radius-composition models, especially given the current focus on finding and characterizing potentially habitable rocky planets. We conclude with recommendations for best practices so that future interpretations of small planets and their formation are accurate and consistent.",

      "abstract": "Timescales diagnostics for saving viscous and MHD-driven dusty discs from external photoevaporation Gabriele Pichierri, Giovanni Rosotti, Rossella Anania, Giuseppe Lodato Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The evolution of protoplanetary discs is a function of their internal processes and of their environment. It is unclear if angular momentum is mainly removed viscously or by magnetic winds, or by a combination of the two. While external photoevaporation is expected to influence disc evolution and dispersal, there are observational limitations towards highly irradiated discs. The interplay between these ingredients and their effect on the gas and dust distributions are poorly understood. We investigate the evolution of both the gaseous and solid components of viscous, MHD-wind or hybrid discs, in combination with external FUV-driven mass loss. We test which combinations of parameters protect discs from external irradiation, allowing the solid component to live long enough to allow planet formation to succeed. We run a suite of 1D simulations of smooth discs with varying initial sizes, levels of viscous and MHD-wind stresses modeled via an $\\alpha$ parametrisation, and strengths of the external FUV environment. We track disc radii, various lifetime diagnostics, and the amount of dust removed by the photoevaporative wind, as a function of the underlying parameters. The biggest role in determining the fate of discs is played by a combination of its ability to spread radially outwards and the strength of FUV-driven erosion. While MHD wind-driven discs experience less FUV erosion due to the lack of spread, they do not live for longer compared to viscously evolving discs, especially at low-to-moderate FUV fluxes, while higher fluxes yield disc lifetimes that are insensitive to the disc's angular momentum transport mechanism. For the solid component, the biggest role is played by a combination of inward drift and removal by FUV winds. This points to the importance of other physical ingredients, such as disc substructures, even in highly-irradiated disc regions, in order to retain solids.",

Under review at AJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Of the > 500 confirmed transiting hot jupiters and approximately 2000 additional candidates today, only ten are known to have nearby companion planets. The survival of nearby companions means that these hot jupiters cannot have migrated to their present location via dynamically disruptive high-eccentricity migration but instead have undergone disk migration or formed in situ. The occurrence rate for these nearby companions, therefore, constrains the relative efficiency of different hot jupiter formation pathways. Here, we perform a uniform box least-squares search for nearby transiting companions to hot jupiters in the first five years of TESS data. Accounting for observational completeness and detection efficiency, we arrive at an occurrence rate of $(7.6^{+5.5}_{-3.8})\\%$, which is a lower limit on the fraction of hot jupiters that underwent disk migration or in situ formation. Comparing this rate with that derived from transit-timing variation searches suggests that hot jupiters are likely mostly aligned with their nearby companions, but their apparently higher incidence of grazing transits may point to a slight preferential misalignment. We also synthesize evidence that hot jupiters with nearby companions may have cold companions at a rate similar to that of other hot jupiters. Comprehensive transit, radial velocity, and stellar obliquity measurements in hot jupiter systems with nearby companions will be necessary to fully account for the relative prevalence of proposed hot jupiter formation pathways.",

Simon 15 pages, 10 figures, submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Identifying the mechanisms responsible for angular momentum transport in protoplanetary disks, and the extent to which those mechanisms produce turbulence, is a crucial problem in understanding planet formation. The bulk of the gas in protoplanetary disks is weakly ionized, which leads to the emergence of three non-ideal effects, Ohmic diffusion, ambipolar diffusion, and the Hall effect. These low-ionization processes can in some cases suppress turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI). However, it has recently been shown that these non-ideal terms can also affect the dynamics of the gas in fundamentally different ways than simple diffusion. In order to further study the role of low-ionization on disk gas dynamics, we carry out a 3D local shearing box simulation with both Ohmic diffusion and ambipolar diffusion and an additional simulation with the Hall effect included. The strength of each non-ideal term, when present, is representative of gas at a radius of 5 AU in a realistic protoplanetary disk. We find the Hall effect increases the saturation strength of the magnetic field, but does not necessarily drive turbulence, consistent with previous work. However, interactions between ambipolar diffusion and the Keplerian shear lead to the ambipolar diffusion shear instability (ADSI), which can drive the initial growth, not damping, of magnetic perturbations. To our knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly demonstrates the viability of the ADSI in the non-linear regime within protoplanetary disks.

He, Eric B. Ford 43 pages, 17+2 figures, 3 tables. Under review in AAS Journals Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The Kepler-observed distribution of planet sizes have revealed two distinct patterns: (1) a radius valley separating super-Earths and sub-Neptunes and (2) a preference for intra-system size similarity. We present a new model for the exoplanet population observed by Kepler, which is a \"hybrid\" of a clustered multi-planet model in which the orbital architectures are set by the angular momentum deficit (AMD) stability (He et al. 2020; arXiv:2007.14473) and a joint mass-radius-period model involving envelope mass-loss driven by photoevaporation (Neil & Rogers 2020; arXiv:1911.03582). We find that the models that produce the deepest radius valleys have a primordial population of planets with initial radii peaking at $\\sim 2.1 R_\\oplus$, which is subsequently sculpted by photoevaporation into a bimodal distribution of final planet radii. The hybrid model requires strongly clustered initial planet masses in order to match the distributions of the size similarity metrics. Thus, the preference for intra-system radius similarity is well explained by a clustering in the primordial mass distribution. The hybrid model also naturally reproduces the observed radius cliff (steep drop-off beyond $\\sim 2.5 R_\\oplus$). Our hybrid model is the latest installment of the SysSim forward models, and is the first multi-planet model capable of simultaneously reproducing the observed radius valley and the intra-system size similarity patterns. We compute occurrence rates and fractions of stars with planets for a variety of planet types, and find that the occurrence of Venus and Earth-like planets drops by a factor of $\\sim 2$-4 for the hybrid models compared to previous clustered models in which there is no envelope mass-loss.",

      "abstract": "Primitive asteroids in the main belt, Cybele, and Hilda populations from Gaia DR3 Noemie El-Bez-Sebastien, Sonia Fornasier, Antoine Seurat, Antonin Wargnier Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Primitive asteroids include C-, P-, and D-classes, known to be dark and having spectra mostly featureless. They differ in the spectral slope, which ranges from moderate values for C-types, and progressively increases in P- and D-types, the latter being the reddest. While C- and P-types are commonly observed in the asteroid main belt, D-types are commonly found further from the Sun, in the Cybele, Hilda, and Jupiter Trojans regions, and very few are reported in the main belt. This study aims at characterizing the abundance of primordial and red asteroids, belonging to the P-, D-, and Z-classes in the Mahlke et al. (2022) taxonomy, in the 2-5.2 AU region using the third data release by the Gaia mission spectral catalog, which includes more than 60000 spectrophotometric data of asteroids. We have applied the following methodology to identify primordial asteroids in the catalog: 1) selection of objects with signal to noise ratio greater than 20; 2) albedo value less than 12%; 3) chi-squared fit to automatically identify potential D-, Z-, and P-types using Bus-DeMeo and Mahlke taxonomy; 4) visual inspection of every spectrum to confirm the taxonomic classification. Referring to Mahlke taxonomy, we have found 318 new D-types across the main belt, as well as 124 Z-types, and is in agreement with theoretical estimations. We computed the spectral slope in the visible range (0.55 - 0.81 \\mu m). We also have identified 265 P-types in the main belt. For the Cybele and Hilda asteroids, we characterize the taxonomic class of all the bodies with SNR higher than 20 in the Gaia catalog, for a total sample of 193 and 180 asteroids, respectively.",

Effect of disc truncation on the growth of S-type planets Julia Venturini, Arianna Nigioni, Maria Paula Ronco, Natacha Jungo, Alexandre Emsenhuber Accepted for publication in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Binary stars are as common as single stars. The number of detected planets orbiting binaries is rapidly increasing thanks to the synergy between transit surveys, Gaia and high-resolution direct imaging campaigns. However, global planet formation models around binary stars are still underdeveloped, which limits the theoretical understanding of planets orbiting binary star systems. Hereby we introduce the PAIRS project, which aims at building a global planet formation model for planets in binaries, and to produce planet populations synthesis to statistically compare theory and observations. In this first paper, we present the adaptation of the circumstellar disc to simulate the formation of S-type planets. The presence of a secondary star tidally truncates and heats the outer part of the circumprimary disc (and vice-versa for the circumsecondary disc), limiting the material to form planets. We implement and quantify this effect for a range of binary parameters by adapting the Bern Model of planet formation in its pebble-based form and for in-situ planet growth. We find that the disc truncation has a strong impact on reducing the pebble supply for core growth, steadily suppressing planet formation for binary separations below 160 au, when considering all the formed planets more massive than Mars. We find as well that S-type planets tend to form close to the central star with respect to the binary separation and disc truncation radius. Our newly developed model will be the basis of future S-type planet population synthesis studies.",

Gravitational perturbation effects from secondary stars Arianna Nigioni, Julia Venturini, Emeline Bolmont, Diego Turrini, Yann Alibert, Alexandre Emsenhuber Accepted for publication in A&A on 20/12/2025, abstract shortened, 18 pages, 19 figures, 3 tables Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Roughly half of Sun-like stars have at least one stellar companion, whereas it is widely assumed that most known exoplanets orbit single stars, largely due to observational biases. However, astrometric surveys, direct imaging, and speckle interferometry are steadily increasing the number of confirmed exoplanets in binaries. A stellar companion introduces additional effects, such as circumstellar disk truncation and gravitational perturbations, which can strongly impact planet formation. While global planet formation models, for example the Bern model, have been broadly applied to single stars, modeling S-type binaries requires key modifications to capture these effects. This study extends the Bern model by incorporating the gravitational influence of a stellar companion into its N-body integrator, allowing us to quantify how this perturbation affects planetary formation and final system architecture across a range of binary configurations. By comparing binary and single-star systems under identical initial conditions, we can assess the specific impact of binary-induced dynamics. We ran three sets of simulations: (i) a grid of in situ single-embryo cases to quantify gravitational effects; (ii) formation simulations with and without migration to compare outcomes with single-star analogs; and (iii) multi-embryo runs to evaluate impacts on multi-planetary systems. Planets forming beyond half the host star's Hill radius are much more likely to become unbound especially in systems with high binary eccentricity. Even within stable zones, growth is suppressed by both reduced material availability and increased eccentricity from stellar perturbations. Both disk truncation and stellar perturbations must be included to model planet formation in S-type binaries accurately. Neglecting either one will end up misrepresenting planetary growth and survival.",

Owen, Ethan Schreyer, James Kirk 12 pages, 7 figures, submitted to MNRAS. Comments welcome Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The internal composition of sub-Neptunes remains a prominent unresolved question in exoplanetary science. We present a technique to place constraints on envelope mean molecular weight that utilises observations of escaping hydrogen or helium exospheres. This method is based on a simple timescale argument, which states that sub-Neptunes require a sufficiently large hydrogen or helium reservoir to explain on-going escape at their observed rates. This then naturally leads to an upper limit on atmospheric mean molecular weight. We apply this technique to archetypal sub-Neptunes, namely GJ-436 b, TOI-776 b and TOI-776 c, which have all been observed to be losing significant hydrogen content as well as relatively featureless transit spectra when observed with JWST. Combining constraints from atmospheric escape and transit spectroscopy in the case of TOI-776 c allows us to tentatively rule out the high mean molecular weight scenario, pointing towards a low mean molecular weight atmosphere with high-altitude aerosols muting spectral features in the infra-red. Finally, we reframe our analysis to the hycean candidate K2-18 b, which has also been shown to host a tentative escaping hydrogen exosphere. If such a detection is robust, we infer a hydrogen-rich envelope mass fraction of $\\log f_\\text{env} = -1.67\\pm0.78$, which is inconsistent with the hycean scenario at the $\\sim 4\\sigma$ level. This latter result requires further observational follow-up to confirm.",

      "abstract": "The impact of disc photoevaporation on the long-term evolution of giant planets in mean motion resonances Emmanuel J. Greenfield, James E. Owen Accepted for publication in MNRAS Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We investigate the long-term impact of disc photoevaporation on the dynamical stability and evolution of giant planet pairs in mean motion resonances. Using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with FARGO3D, in which we have included mass-loss due to photoevaporation, we explore a parameter space covering disc mass, viscosity, planet mass, and resonance type. We find that strong photoevaporation depletes gas in the common gap between the planets, slowing migration and suppressing planet-disc interactions that typically lead to resonance breaking and eccentricity damping. This stabilising effect is most significant for 3:2 resonances, which are more prone to disruption due to the reduced planet spacing. In contrast, 2:1 resonances are generally more robust but can still be destabilised at high disc mass and moderate-to-strong photoevaporation due to asymmetric torques. Photoevaporation can therefore stabilise resonances that would otherwise break, or conversely disrupt resonances that are natively more stable. Even in cases where photoevaporation does not directly affect resonance stability, it typically results in increased planetary eccentricities. These results highlight the complex, system-dependent nature of resonance evolution, with implications for the final orbital architectures of giant planet systems and their detectability via astrometry from missions such as Gaia.",
