With proposed strain sensitivities, LILA would also be able to measure the normal modes of the Moon from 1-10 mHz at high signal-to-noise ratio. Such measurements would enable significant advances in our understanding of both the spherically symmetric and even 3D deep internal structure of the Moon. Strainmeter measurements may even be able to detect the translational mode of the solid inner core of the Moon at frequencies below 0.1 mHz. Inertial seismometers, on the other hand, are unlikely to reach the performance of $\\sim10^{-16}$ m/s$^2$/$\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$ required to reliably detect normal modes below 5-10 mHz, even with optimistic assumptions on future projected performance.",

Submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We derive models of rotating very massive stellar cores with mass $\\approx 10^2$--$10^4M_\\odot$ which are marginally stable to the pair-unstable collapse, assuming that the core is isentropic and composed primarily of oxygen. It is shown that the cores with mass $\\lesssim 10^3M_\\odot$ can form a massive disk with the mass more than 10% of the core mass around the formed black hole if the core is rotating with more than 30% of the Keplerian limit. We also indicate that the formation of rapidly spinning massive black holes such as the black holes of GW231123 naturally accompanies the massive disk formation. By using the result of our previous study which showed that the massive disk is unstable to the non-axisymmetric deformation, we predict the amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves and show that the collapse of rotating very massive stellar cores can be a promising source of gravitational waves for Einstein Telescope. The detection of such gravitational waves will provide us with important information about a formation process of intermediate mass black holes.",

We illustrate the working principle of the detector and discuss that several classes of gravitational wave sources, both of astrophysical and cosmological origin, may be within the detection range of this instrument.

Along with presenting the complete analytic expression and corresponding numerical results, we also derive simplified formulas valid in the large- and small-$k$ limits, as well as in the flat-spacetime limit. The latter expansion reveals that the flat-spacetime approximation breaks down for $\\beta / H_* \\lesssim 10$, where $\\beta$ denotes the inverse duration of the phase transition and $H_*$ the Hubble parameter at its completion.

Figueroa, Sami Raatikainen, Syksy Rasanen, Eemeli Tomberg 31+16 pages, 16 figures. v3. Corrected typos in equations Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We study the impact of stochastic noise on the generation of primordial black hole (PBH) seeds in ultra-slow-roll (USR) inflation with numerical simulations. We consider the non-linearity of the system by consistently taking into account the noise dependence on the inflaton perturbations, while evolving the perturbations on the coarse-grained background affected by the noise. We capture in this way the non-Markovian nature of the dynamics, and demonstrate that non-Markovian effects are subleading. Using the $\\Delta N$ formalism, we find the probability distribution $P(\\mathcal{R})$ of the comoving curvature perturbation $\\mathcal{R}$. We consider inflationary potentials that fit the CMB and lead to PBH dark matter with $i)$ asteroid, $ii)$ solar, or $iii)$ Planck mass, as well as $iv)$ PBHs that form the seeds of supermassive black holes. We find that stochastic effects enhance the PBH abundance by a factor of $\\mathcal{O}(10)-\\mathcal{O}(10^8)$, depending on the PBH mass. We also show that the usual approximation, where stochastic kicks depend only on the Hubble rate, either underestimates or overestimates the abundance by orders of magnitude, depending on the potential. We evaluate the gauge dependence of the results, discuss the quantum-to-classical transition, and highlight open issues of the application of the stochastic formalism to USR inflation.",

Wali Hossain, Afaq Maqsood 16 pages, 1 table, 8 figures, Accepted in PRD Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate non phantom tracker scalar field models as dynamical dark energy scenario. These models can alleviate the cosmic coincidence problem and transition to a cosmological constant-like behaviour at late times. Focusing on the inverse axionlike and inverse steep exponential potentials, we study their background evolution and perturbations, finding a mild suppression in the matter power spectrum compared to $\\Lambda$CDM but no distinguishing features in the bispectrum.

Our results indicate that, within the framework of non-phantom tracker models, the data show no evidence for dynamical dark energy. The $\\Lambda$CDM model continues to provide a better fit to current observations in the non phantom regime. We emphasise, however, that our analysis does not rule out the possibility of phantom-crossing dark energy models, which have been found in other studies to provide a better fit to some datasets.",

To appear in PRD Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as powerful probes in cosmology. An optimized method was recently proposed to extract the cosmic baryon density from localized FRBs by maximizing the joint likelihood function of the extragalactic dispersion measure ($\\mathrm{DM}_{\\mathrm{ext}}$). In this paper, we identify a crucial factor that was omitted in the probability density function (PDF) for $\\mathrm{DM}_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ in that method. Using simulated FRB data, we demonstrate that neglecting this factor leads to a systematic bias in the inferred cosmic baryon density, with deviations exceeding the $1\\sigma$ confidence level. This highlights the necessity of including the missing factor for reliable cosmological applications of FRBs. Furthermore, applying our corrected PDF to a sample of 88 real localized FRBs, we find that the baryon density inferred with the original PDF is inconsistent with the Planck 2018 CMB results, whereas our corrected PDF yields excellent agreement.",

This approach is designed to enable field-level inference with data from Stage IV cosmological surveys. Building on the reaction method, which models the nonlinear matter power spectrum in modified gravity as corrections to a \"pseudo\" $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we extend the method to full field-level predictions by applying it to the output of $N$-body simulations, including both positions and velocities. We focus on modifications to gravity that are scale-independent at the linear level, allowing us to isolate and emulate nonlinear deviations, particularly screening effects. Our neural network predicts the field-level correction (\"reaction\") to a pseudo$\\Lambda$CDM simulation whose linear clustering matches that of the target. The emulator achieves sub-percent accuracy across a broad range of summary statistics, including 0.4\\% agreement in the matter power spectrum at scales $k < 1$ Mpc$/h$, and 2\\% accuracy in redshift-space distortion multipoles at $k < 0.3$ Mpc$/h$. We also validate the emulator against $N$-body simulations with increased force resolution and time steps, confirming the robustness of its performance. These results demonstrate that our framework is a practical and reliable tool for incorporating screened modified gravity models into field-level cosmological inference, enabling stringent tests of extra fundamental forces at cosmological scales.",

The ability to self-consistently capture the birth of a compact remnant in 3D is crucial for modeling natal BH properties (including masses, spins, and kicks), which are of particular interest in the era of gravitational wave astronomy. However, such simulations have remained elusive due to extreme computational challenges and demands. We employ the GPU-accelerated dynamical-spacetime GRMHD code GRaM-X to follow the collapse, core-bounce, shock propagation, and eventual BH formation of a massive stellar progenitor in full 3D. We initialize our simulation by mapping a one-dimensional (1D) model of a star with a zero-age-main-sequence mass of $45 M_\\odot$ to 3D. We use moderate rotation (consistent with expectations from stellar evolution modeling) and a relatively weak dipolar magnetic field. The collapsing core drives a shock that reaches a maximum radius of roughly 170 km before stalling and does not lead to a successful explosion. The proto-neutron star accretes matter before collapsing to form a BH $t_{BH} \\approx 325$ ms after core-bounce. The time of BH formation and initial BH mass are remarkably similar to those obtained with GR1D, a 1D general-relativistic neutrino-hydrodynamics code, to which we compare our results. We track the horizon of the newborn BH after formation and calculate a steady kick velocity of $v_{kick} \\approx 72$ km/s and a mass of $M_{BH} \\approx 2.62 M_\\odot$, which is still rising at the end of the simulation.",

Using RULES, we generate $uv$-complete layouts that cover the range $10\\lambda\\leq|(u,v)|\\leq 100\\lambda$ with fewer than 1000 antennas of diameter $5\\lambda$, comparable to current and planned arrays. We demonstrate the effectiveness of such arrays for mitigating contamination from bright astrophysical foregrounds in 21 cm Epoch of Reionization observations,particularly in the region of Fourier space known as the foreground wedge,by simulating visibilities of foreground-like sky models over the 130-150 MHz band and processing them through an image-based power spectrum estimator. We find that with complete $uv$ coverage, the wedge power is suppressed by sixteen orders of magnitude compared to an array with a compact hexagonal layout (used as a reference for a sparse $uv$ coverage). In contrast, we show that an array with the same number of antennas but in a random configuration only suppresses the wedge by three orders of magnitude, despite sampling more distinct $uv$ points over the same range. We address real-world challenges and find that our results are sensitive to small antenna position errors and missing baselines, while still performing equally or significantly better than random arrays in any case. We propose ways to mitigate those challenges such as a minimum redundancy requirement or tighter $uv$ packing density.",

This serves as a natural extension of the single-component, non-interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) paradigm. Concretely, we consider an ultra-light Abelian-Higgs model, with interacting Higgs and dark photon degrees of freedom. We find that the transfer function, and hence imprint on the CMB and Large-Scale Structure (LSS), is characterized by a single characteristic scale of the interacting fuzzy dark sector, allowing us to recover the LSS signature of single-field FDM, dependent on the FDS parameters. In contrast, galactic halos present a great diversity, unlike with the universality of single-field FDM, owing to the interaction between fields. This interaction introduces an instability that is not otherwise present for the case of four decoupled scalars. Finally, we comment on primordial production and portals to the Standard Model, and introduce another simple realization of the Fuzzy Dark Sector paradigm with a kinetic coupling.",

Zou Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We perform an analysis of the full shapes of Lyman-$\\alpha$ (Ly$\\alpha$) forest correlation functions measured from the first data release (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our analysis focuses on measuring the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect and the cosmic growth rate times the amplitude of matter fluctuations in spheres of $8$ $h^{-1}\\text{Mpc}$, $f\\sigma_8$. We validate our measurements using two different sets of mocks, a series of data splits, and a large set of analysis variations, which were first performed blinded. Our analysis constrains the ratio $D_M/D_H(z_\\mathrm{eff})=4.525\\pm0.071$, where $D_H=c/H(z)$ is the Hubble distance, $D_M$ is the transverse comoving distance, and the effective redshift is $z_\\mathrm{eff}=2.33$. This is a factor of $2.4$ tighter than the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) constraint from the same data. When combining with Ly$\\alpha$ BAO constraints from DESI DR2, we obtain the ratios $D_H(z_\\mathrm{eff})/r_d=8.646\\pm0.077$ and $D_M(z_\\mathrm{eff})/r_d=38.90\\pm0.38$, where $r_d$ is the sound horizon at the drag epoch. We also measure $f\\sigma_8(z_\\mathrm{eff}) = 0.37\\; ^{+0.055}_{-0.065} \\,(\\mathrm{stat})\\, \\pm 0.033 \\,(\\mathrm{sys})$, but we do not use it for cosmological inference due to difficulties in its validation with mocks. In $\\Lambda$CDM, our measurements are consistent with both cosmic microwave background (CMB) and galaxy clustering constraints. Using a nucleosynthesis prior but no CMB anisotropy information, we measure the Hubble constant to be $H_0 = 68.3\\pm 1.6\\;\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$ within $\\Lambda$CDM. Finally, we show that Ly$\\alpha$ forest AP measurements can help improve constraints on the dark energy equation of state, and are expected to play an important role in upcoming DESI analyses.",

This inflationary model has become very important because it allows us to describe the initial accelerated expansion of the universe in the inflationary epoch, and the current accelerated expansion with the same potential that depends on one scalar field $\\varphi$. Once the equations for the scalar and tensor power spectra are found, we calculate the observables: the scalar-to-tensor ratio $r$, and the scalar spectral index $n_S$, concluding that semiclassical methods give excellent results compared to numerical integration.

Alternative models exist in the literature, both phenomenological and physically motivated, many of them suffering from similar or new problems. We propose a method to mechanically generate alternative models in a procedure informed by data and tuned to mitigate specific problems. We implement a computational framework, dubbed CosmoGen, that integrates evolutionary algorithms for symbolic regression, with computation of structure formation and background cosmological quantities that are used to guide the evolutionary process. As a proof-of-concept we apply the procedure to the specific case of dark energy fluid models, and ask the framework to generate models capable of alleviating the cosmological tensions $S_8$ and $H_0$. The system generates models with high fitness values, and through a Bayesian analysis of an illustrative model, we show that the model indeed alleviates the tensions.",

After having obtained such accurate spectroscopic catalogs, we inject in the mocks the observational effects characterizing the Quaia catalog: (i) spectrophotometric redshift uncertainties, (ii) the angular selection function, and (iii) the redshift number counts distribution. We assess the accuracy of our catalogs by validating a number of summary statistics: the full-sky QSO maps, the redshift uncertainty distributions as a function of redshift, the redshift $n(z)$ distribution, the angular power spectra and their normalized covariance matrices, and the angular two-point correlation functions. We find excellent agreement between these metrics from the mocks and from the Quaia catalog. We publicly release the mock catalogs to the community.",

We investigate which survey configurations detect the 21cm-LAE cross-correlation signal, and assess its ability to distinguish reionisation scenarios. Our pipeline computes observational uncertainties for the 21cm-galaxy cross-power spectrum, accounting for key survey parameters: the field of view (FoV), limiting luminosity of galaxy surveys $L_\\alpha$, redshift uncertainty $\\sigma_z$, and 21cm foreground wedge assumptions. We calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the 21cm-Lyman-$\\alpha$ emitter (LAE) cross-power spectrum for two scenarios: one where reionisation is driven by faint or by bright galaxies. We find: (i) SNR increases with larger FoV, fainter $L_\\alpha$, and smaller $\\sigma_z$, with the FoV having the strongest impact when $\\sigma_z$ is small. (ii) Under a moderate foreground wedge, photometric-like surveys yield insufficient SNR, and medium-deep ($L_\\alpha\\gtrsim10^{42.5}$erg s$^{-1}$), wide-area (FoV>20deg$^2$) slitless spectroscopic surveys are needed. (iii) Under an optimistic foreground wedge, detection is possible with deep ($L_\\alpha\\gtrsim10^{42.3}$erg s$^{-1}$), wide-area (FoV$\\gtrsim80$deg$^2$) photometric-like or shallower, small-area (FoV$\\simeq2-3$deg$^2$) slitless spectroscopic surveys. (iv) To distinguish the two reionisation scenarios at z=7, moderate foreground wedge scenarios require deep-wide spectroscopic surveys; under an optimistic foreground wedge, shallower, medium-area (FoV$\\simeq10$deg$^2$) slitless spectroscopic surveys suffice. (v) Maximising the SNR for detection and model discrimination requires sampling the large-scale peak of the cross-power spectrum, which shifts to larger physical scales as reionisation proceeds and the less ionisation fronts follow the gas density - making surveys at z>7 more promising despite lower galaxy number densities.",

Williams, Jiashuo Zhang 12 pages, 13 figures, submitted to MNRAS Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We explore for the first time the possibility of detecting lensed star transients in galaxy-galaxy strong lensing systems upon repeated, deep imaging using the {\\it James-Webb Space Telescope} ({\\it JWST}). Our calculation predicts that the extremely high recent star formation rate of $\\sim 100\\,M_{\\odot}\\textrm{yr}^{-1}$ over the last 50 Myr (not accounting for image multiplicity) in the ``Cosmic Horseshoe'' lensed system ($z = 2.381$) generates many young, bright stars, of which their large abundance is expected to lead to a detection rate of $\\sim 60$ transients per pointing in {\\it JWST} observations with a $5\\sigma$ limiting magnitude of $\\sim 29\\,m_{AB}$. With the high expected detection rate and little room for uncertainty for the lens model compared with cluster lenses, our result suggests that the Cosmic Horseshoe could be an excellent tool to test the nature of Dark Matter based on the spatial distribution of transients, and can be used to constrain axion mass if Dark Matter is constituted of ultra-light axions. We also argue that the large distance modulus of $\\sim46.5\\,$mag at $z \\approx 2.4$ can act as a filter to screen out less massive stars as transients and allow one to better constrain the high-mass end of the stellar initial mass function based on the transient detection rate.

      "abstract": "Unified dark fluid with null sound speed as an alternative to phantom dark energy Raphaël Kou, Antony Lewis Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Recent BAO measurements from DESI, when combined with CMB and supernovae data, suggest evolving dark energy and in particular point to a possible phantom regime, with an equation of state parameter $w<-1$. We explore an alternative phenomenological way to model dark matter and dark energy based on a unified dark fluid (UDF). By construction, our model reproduces the same background expansion history as DESI's best-fit using the CPL parametrization, but assumes a vanishing rest-frame sound speed and no anisotropic stress. This simple prescription ensures a consistent and physical treatment of perturbations, and the use of a unified dark sector avoids phantom behaviour by construction. We model CMB, LSS, and redshift-space distortion observables, and find differences with CPL that are typically at the few-percent level. As a result, we forecast that even stage IV CMB and galaxy surveys will have limited power to discriminate between our UDF and CPL at the linear level. At the non-linear level, we study spherical collapse in the UDF and show that within this framework, structure formation proceeds very similarly to standard scenarios. Using Planck, DESI BAO DR2, and DESY5 supernovae data, we demonstrate that this simple UDF model fits current observations nearly as well as CPL, while treating perturbations consistently. Because most cosmological observations are not sensitive to how the dark sector is split, the unified framework can also approximate the phenomenology of interacting dark energy-dark matter scenarios or evolving dark matter, making it a general way to model the data, at least as long as the dark components have a vanishing sound speed, which is the most distinctive feature of our analysis. This highlights that a unified dark fluid with evolving equation of state and null sound speed is sufficient to pass current constraints without a phantom component.",

The method relies on generalized Padé-$(2,1)$ expansions around arbitrary pivot redshifts, which, compared to state-of-the-art calculations, reduce truncation errors by up to two orders of magnitude at high redshift and yield more precise constraints by defining cosmographic parameters exactly where the data lie. This avoids extrapolations, mitigates degeneracies, and enables a clean disentangling of their effects. Using the latest low-redshift datasets, we center the generalized expansion in multiple bins across $z\\in[0,1]$ and obtain precise constraints on the redshift evolution of cosmographic parameters. We find that all key parameters deviate from their $\\Lambda$CDM predictions in a redshift-dependent way that can be naturally explained within dynamical Dark Energy scenarios. The deceleration parameter $q(z)$ follows a redshift evolution consistent with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization, while the generalized $Om(z)$ diagnostic shows deviations of up to $\\sim4\\sigma$ from the constant $\\Lambda$CDM expectation, closely matching the CPL predictions.

Sánchez-Conde, Gabrijela Zaharijas 8 pages, 3 figures, presented at the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC2025) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Galaxy clusters are the most massive gravitationally bound structures in the Universe. Even if clusters are nearly virialized structures, they undergo merging processes, creating merging shocks, and suffer from feedback from galaxies and Active Galactic Nuclei; causing complex turbulent motions and amplifying their magnetic fields. These processes act as acceleration mechanisms for the plasma of the intracluster medium (ICM), originating a population of cosmic rays (CRs). Leptonic CRs have long been detected, but we should also expect a CR hadronic population that, through interactions with the ICM, should produce neutral pions that decay into gamma-rays. The detection of diffuse gamma-ray emission from galaxy clusters is one of the long-awaited milestones for the high-energy astroparticle physics community. Still, no unambiguous detection has yet been obtained. In this talk, we will present the results of a combined cluster analysis searching for CR-induced gamma-ray signals, using 16 years of Fermi-LAT data. In our previous work (di Mauro et al. 2023) we obtained from the combined analysis of 49 local galaxy clusters (12 years of data) a hint of signal between 2.5-3 sigma. These results are consistent with other works as well, which consistently find a non-vanishing hint of signal, around the detection threshold. In this new work, we use a sample of near, well-known galaxy clusters and develop CR-induced emission templates using well-established X-ray measurements for calibration, assuming self similarity for the members of our sample. To strengthen the robustness of our analysis, we define benchmark models to encapsulate the uncertainties in the spectral and spatial profiles for the CR-induced emission and perform the standard template-fitting analysis using the likelihood ratio test.",

Constraints on its strength $B$ can be derived from its influence on time-delayed very-high-energy photons from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) in the electromagnetic cascades along their path to the Earth. The present lower limit achieved on its intensity is $10^{-18}\\;\\mathrm{G}$. In this work, we simulate data from the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), accounting for realistic observational constraints, and we apply a joint spectral and temporal fit to characterize the IGMF. GRBs 190114C and 221009A are used as test cases to assess the sensitivity of CTAO. They demonstrate that a broad range of IGMF strengths can be probed with a lower bound as high as $10^{-15}\\;\\mathrm{G}$. Notably, we show that observations by the CTAO first large telescope, LST-1, already allow us to exclude field strengths up to $3\\times 10^{-17}\\;\\mathrm{G}$.",

See Fig. 3 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) A quadruply lensed source, J125856.3-031944, has been discovered using the DELVE survey and WISE W1 - W2 colors. Followup direct imaging carried out with the Magellan Baade 6.5 m telescope is analyzed, as is spectroscopy from the 2.5 m Nordic Optical Telescope. The lensed image configuration is kite-like, with the major axis of the lensing galaxy along the symmetry axis of the kite, and with the faintest image at its tail. Redward of 6000 AA the tail image is strongly blended with the lensing galaxy. The Sloan g direct imaging carried out with Magellan permits deblending. As the lensed image configuration is nearly circular, simple models give high predicted magnifications for all four images. The source's narrow emission lines at redshift z=2.225 and low intrinsic luminosity qualify it as a Type 2 AGN. The Magellan image shows a substantial residual that suggests a second lensing galaxy.",

Replaced with the accepted version (minor changes) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Algebraic Topology (math.AT) Building upon [2308.02636], we investigate the constraining power of persistent homology on cosmological parameters and primordial non-Gaussianity in a likelihood-free inference pipeline utilizing machine learning. We evaluate the ability of Persistence Images (PIs) to infer parameters, comparing them to the combined Power Spectrum and Bispectrum (PS/BS). We also compare two classes of models: neural-based and tree-based. PIs consistently lead to better predictions compared to the combined PS/BS for parameters that can be constrained, i.e., for $\\{\\Omega_{\\rm m}, \\sigma_8, n_{\\rm s}, f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc}\\}$. PIs perform particularly well for $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc}$, highlighting the potential of persistent homology for constraining primordial non-Gaussianity. Our results indicate that combining PIs with PS/BS provides only marginal gains, indicating that the PS/BS contains little additional or complementary information to the PIs. Finally, we provide a visualization of the most important topological features for $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc}$ and for $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$. This reveals that clusters and voids (0-cycles and 2-cycles) are most informative for $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$, while $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc}$ is additionally informed by filaments (1-cycles).",

In this work we investigate the potential of future Earth- and Moon-based 21-cm surveys to constrain the growth of structures during the currently unexplored redshift range $30 < z < 200$. On the one hand we show how foreground contamination could limit the capabilities of future instruments in achieving precision below the $10\\%$ level. On the other hand, observations from the far side of the Moon have the potential to reach percent or even sub-percent precision in terms of reconstructing the growth of cosmic structures, if foregrounds are robustly accounted for. Such exquisite precision will provide tight constraints on models that induce deviations from $\\Lambda$CDM, not only during the Dark Ages, but also during recombination or that manifest mostly in the low-redshift Universe, like Early Dark Energy and nDGP models, respectively. Thus, because of their insensitivity to non-linearities or astrophysical processes, line intensity mapping surveys will provide a formidable consistency check to potential claims of discoveries of new physics that affect the growth of structures.",

Since intrinsic alignment is a spin-2 observable, the bispectrum of intrinsic alignments contains a parity-even and a parity-odd part, the latter being nonzero even in the absence of parity violation. Moreover, all possible combinations of scalar, E- and B-mode bispectra are nonzero in the absence of parity violation. In analogy to the galaxy bispectrum in redshift space, we construct a complete set of multipoles for anisotropic bispectra of projected spin-2 fields. We then construct separable bispectrum estimators, both for parity-even and parity-odd bispectra, which can be computed by means of Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs). We compare several different choices of angular weighting in terms of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) for a Stage IV setup using luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) with galaxy shapes measured by the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Assuming an overlapping area of $\\sim 4,000$ square degrees (yielding $\\sim 1.3$ million LRGs) and including scales up to $k_\\text{max} = 0.14\\,h$/Mpc, we find that the position-position-E-mode bispectrum $B_{DDE}$ (which is parity-even) can be strongly detected at SNR $\\sim 30$, while detecting parity-odd bispectra (such as $B_{DDB}$, SNR $\\sim 5$) or bispectra with more than one shape field (such as $B_{DEE}$, SNR $\\sim 5$) may also be possible.",

The corresponding energy density $\\rho$ is derived from the continuity equation, resulting in a dynamical equation-of-state parameter $w \\equiv p/\\rho$ during the late-time expansion of the Universe. The pressure is modeled using a Taylor expansion around the present epoch ($a = 1$), introducing deviations from a cosmological constant within the dynamical dark energy (DDE) framework. At first order, a single new parameter $\\Omega_1$ captures linear deviations, while a second-order parameter, $\\Omega_2$, accounts for quadratic evolution in the pressure. We constrain the first- and second-order DDE models using multiple observational datasets and compare their performance against $\\Lambda$CDM and the CPL parameterization. A joint analysis of Planck CMB, DESI, and DESY5 data yields the strongest evidence for DDE, with a $2.7\\sigma$ deviation in the first-order model and over $4\\sigma$ in the second-order model, providing strong statistical support for a departure from a cosmological constant. The reconstructed DE evolution in the second-order case reveals a distinctive non-monotonic behavior in both energy density and $w_{\\rm DE}(a)$, including clear phantom-crossing phenomena. Notably, the late-time evolution of $w_{\\rm DE}(a)$ remains consistent across datasets and shows strong agreement with the CPL parameterization, underscoring the robustness of the pressure-based approach.",

Extending our previously developed N-1-body simulation framework from Milky Way scales to solar system dynamics, we model how cosmic neutrino background densities might vary throughout Earth's orbital cycle. We validate our numerical approach against analytical expectations from previous studies that assumed idealized relic neutrino populations. Our results suggest that the prior gravitational history of neutrinos traversing asymmetric dark matter distributions can affect annual modulation patterns. While our simulations reproduce modulation amplitudes similar to analytical predictions for heavier neutrinos, we find that the amplitude can vary considerably depending on the specific morphology of dark matter halos. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating realistic structure formation effects when predicting potential observational relic neutrino signatures.",

Nadler, Philip Mansfield, Andrew Benson 21 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication by JCAP Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Cosmological N-body simulations are among the primary tools for studying structure formation in the Universe. Analyses of these simulations critically depend on accurately identifying and tracking dark matter subhalos over time. In recent years, several new algorithms have been developed to improve the accuracy and consistency of subhalo tracking in cold dark matter simulations. These algorithms should be revisited in the context of new physics beyond gravity, which can modify the evolution and final properties of subhalo populations. In this work, we apply the particle-tracking-based subhalo finder Symfind to velocity-dependent self-interacting dark matter simulations with large cross section amplitudes to assess the performance of particle-tracking methods beyond the CDM paradigm. We find that the core-particle-tracking technique, which is key to the success of these algorithms in CDM, does not always yield accurate results in SIDM. The interplay between dark matter self-interactions and tidal stripping can cause the diffusion of core particles to larger radii, leading particle-tracking-based algorithms to prematurely lose track of SIDM subhalos. For massive core-expansion subhalos and core-collapse subhalos that experience close or repeated pericentric passages, a significant fraction of core particles can be lost, and particle-tracking-based finders such as Symfind offer no clear advantage over traditional methods that rely on identifying phase-space overdensities. On the other hand, for subhalos with large pericentric distances or fewer, more distant passages, Symfind tends to outperform. These differences depend sensitively on the cross section amplitude and turnover velocity of the underlying SIDM model. We therefore recommend a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both techniques to produce complete and robust catalogs of core-expansion and core-collapse SIDM subhalos.",

Current version matching the accepted manuscript Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The HI mass function is a crucial tool to understand the evolution of the HI content in galaxies over cosmic times. We aim to derive semi-empirical constraints at $z\\sim 0.37$ by combining literature results on the $M_\\star$ function from optical surveys with recent findings on the $M_{\\rm HI}-M_\\star$ scaling relation derived via spectral stacking analysis applied to 21-cm line interferometric data from the MIGHTEE and CHILES surveys, conducted with the MeerKAT and VLA radio telescopes, respectively. We draw synthetic $M_\\star$ samples directly from the publicly-available results underlying the analysis of the COSMOS2020 galaxy photometric sample. Afterwards, we convert $M_\\star$ into $M_{\\rm HI}$ using analytical fitting functions to the data points from HI stacking. We then fit a Schechter function to the median HIMF from all the samples via MCMC. We finally derive the posterior distribution for $\\Omega_{\\rm HI}$ by integrating the models for the HIMF built from the posteriors samples of the Schechter parameters. We find a deviation of the HIMF at $z\\sim 0.37$ from the results at $z\\sim 0$ from the ALFALFA survey and at $z\\sim 1$ from uGMRT data. Our results for $\\Omega_{\\rm HI}$ are in broad agreement with other literature results, and follow the overall trend on $\\Omega_{\\rm HI}$ as a function of redshift. The derived value $\\Omega_{\\rm HI}=\\left(7.02^{+0.59}_{-0.52}\\right)\\times10^{-4}$ at $z\\sim 0.37$ from the combined analysis deviates at $\\sim 2.9\\sigma$ from the ALFALFA result at $z\\sim 0$. Our findings about the HIMF and $\\Omega_{\\rm HI}$ differ from previous literature results at $z\\sim0$ and $z\\sim1$, although we are unable to confirm at this stage whether these differences are due to cosmic evolution consistent with a smooth transition of the HI content of galaxies over the last 8 Gyr or due to selection biases and systematics.",

A previous study suggested that the interaction between the jets and the magnetic fields on the cold front has produced such an outstanding feature; however, it is still not known how the jet propagates the long distance keeping the sharp shape. In this study, we performed a polarization analysis of MRC 0600-399 and a nearby radio source using MeerKAT L-band data. To interpret the Faraday structure, we constructed the Pseudo-3D visualization map of the reconstructed Faraday dispersion function 3D cube. MRC 0600-399 has a complicated Faraday depth structure, and some of the Faraday depth features are in good agreement with the 2D structure on the celestial sphere. For the northern jet of MRC 0600-399, the Faraday depth values show a clear gap at the tip region. Based on the polarization analysis and comparison with the other observation, we concluded that the synchrotron radiation from the tip region of the northern jet originates from the magnetic field on the cold front.",

Comments welcome! High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) The transport of cosmic rays through turbulent astrophysical plasmas still constitutes an open problem. Building on recent progress, we study the combined effect of magnetic mirroring and resonant curvature scattering on parallel and perpendicular transport. We conduct test particle simulations in snapshots of an anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics simulation, and record magnetic moment variation and field line curvature around pitch angle reversals. We find for strongly magnetized particles that (i) pitch angle reversals may occur either in coherent regions of the field with small variation of the magnetic moment via magnetic mirroring, or in chaotic regions of the field with strong variation of the magnetic moment via resonant curvature scattering; (ii) parallel transport can be modeled as a Lévy walk with a truncated power-law distribution based on pitch angle reversal times; and (iii) perpendicular transport is enhanced by resonant curvature scattering in synergy with chaotic field line separation, and diminished by magnetic mirroring due to confinement in locally ordered field line bundles. While magnetic mirroring constitutes the bulk of reversal events, resonant curvature scattering additionally acts on trajectories which fall in the loss cones of typical mirroring structures and thus provides the cut-off for the reversal time distribution. Our results, which highlight the role of the magnetic field line geometry in cosmic ray transport processes, are consistent with energy-independent diffusion coefficients. We conclude by considering how energy-dependent observations could arise from an intermittently inhomogeneous interstellar medium.",

This is because of the competition between decay and interaction of the parent mesons, which depends on the atmospheric density. As a result, the number of muons at ground shows a seasonal variation, with the strength of the variation depending on the primary cosmic-ray energy, mass, as well as the energy of the detected muons. In this contribution, we study the variations of the muon energy spectrum in air showers using MCEq, a numerical solver of the cascade equations. In particular, we show how the amplitude of the seasonal variations of the number of high-energy (O(TeV)) muons in the shower depends on the primary energy, mass, as well as the assumed hadronic interaction model. A measurement of these variations is possible with the combination of a surface air-shower array and a deep underground detector, which provide a simultaneous measurement of the primary energy and the high-energy muon multiplicity, and may provide a new way to probe the cosmic-ray mass composition and hadronic interactions.",

The soft spectral index of these neutrinos has previously been interpreted as an indication that this source accelerates protons only up to energies of several hundred TeV. Here, we propose that this source might instead accelerate protons to significantly higher energies, but that the charged pions and muons produced in their interactions undergo significant synchrotron energy losses before they can decay, leading to a cutoff in the neutrino spectrum at TeV-scale energies. This scenario would require very strong magnetic fields to be present in the acceleration region of NGC 1068, on the order of $B \\sim 10^7 \\, {\\rm G}$.

Next, the EAS optical Cherenkov and radio emission, signal attenuation to the detector, and the detector response are modeled to determine the sensitivity to both the diffuse cosmic neutrinos and transient neutrino sources. Using the Earth as a tau neutrino target and the atmosphere as the signal generator effectively forms a detector with a mega-gigaton mass.

Accepted for publication in A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) IGR J17511-3057 was observed in a new outburst phase starting in February 2025 and lasting at least nine days. We investigated the spectral and temporal properties of IGR J17511-3057, aiming to characterise its current status and highlight possible long-term evolution of its properties. We analysed the available NICER and NuSTAR observations performed during the latest outburst of the source. We updated the ephemerides of the neutron star and compared them to previous outbursts to investigate its long-term evolution. We also performed spectral analysis of the broadband energy spectrum in different outburst phases, and investigated the time-resolved spectrum of the type-I X-ray burst event observed with NuSTAR. We detected X-ray pulsations at a frequency of around 245 Hz. The long-term evolution of the neutron star ephemerides suggests a spin-down derivative of about -2.3e-15 Hz/s, compatible with a rotation-powered phase while in quiescence. Moreover, the evolution of the orbital period and the time of the ascending node suggests a fast orbital shrinkage, which challenges the standard evolution scenario for this class of pulsars involving angular momentum loss via gravitational wave emission. The spectral analysis revealed a dominant power-law-like Comptonisation component, along with a thermal blackbody component, consistent with a hard state. Weak broad emission residuals around 6.6 keV suggest the presence of a K-alpha transition of neutral or He-like Fe originating from the inner region of the accretion disc. Self-consistent reflection models confirmed a moderate ionisation of the disc truncated at around (82-370) km from the neutron star. Finally, the study of the type-I X-ray burst revealed no signature of photospheric radius expansion. We found marginally significant burst oscillations during the rise and decay of the event, consistent with the neutron star spin frequency.",

Lasky High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) With the release of the fourth LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA gravitational-wave catalog (GWTC-4), we are starting to gain a detailed view of the population of merging binary black holes. The formation channels of these black holes is not clearly understood, but different formation mechanisms may lead to subpopulations with different properties visible in gravitational-wave data. Adopting a phenomenological approach, we find GWTC-4 data supports the presence of at least three subpopulations, each associated with a different range of black hole mass and with sharp transition boundaries between them. Each subpopulation is characterized by different distributions for either the mass ratios, the black-hole spin magnitudes or both. Subpopulation A with primary mass $m_1 \\leq 27.7^{+4.1}_{-3.4} M_{\\odot}$ ($90 \\%$ credibility), is characterized by a nearly flat mass ratio distribution $q=m_2/m_1$, and by small spin magnitudes ($\\chi \\leq 0.5^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$). Subpopulation B with $27.7^{+4.1}_{-3.4} M_{\\odot} \\leq m_1 \\leq 40.2^{+4.7}_{-3.2} M_{\\odot}$, has a much sharper preference for mass ratio $q \\approx 1$. Subpopulation C, with $m_1 \\geq 40.2^{+4.7}_{-3.2} M_{\\odot}$, has support for large spin magnitudes, and tentative support for mass ratios $q\\approx0.5$. We interpret these transitions as evidence for multiple subpopulations, each potentially associated with a different formation pathways. We suggest potential formation scenarios for each subpopulations, and suggest that Subpopulation B may be associated with chemically homogeneous evolution or population III stars. Our findings for Subpopulation C are largely consistent with recent claims of hierarchical mergers, but with some curious differences in properties.",

Mulas, C. Buemi, F. Cavallaro, P. Leto, A. Melis, P. Reich, W. Reich, S. Riggi, A.C. Ruggeri High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Strong shocks occurring in supernova remnants (SNRs), and their interaction with an often anisotropic surrounding medium, make SNRs ideal laboratories for studying the production and acceleration of cosmic rays (CRs). Due to their complex morphology and phenomenology, different CR populations are expected to exist throughout the remnants, each characterized by its own energy spectrum. A comprehensive understanding of particle acceleration mechanisms and energetics in SNRs requires spatially resolved spectral and morphological studies. We want to highlight the crucial role of high-resolution radio images at high frequencies (> 10 GHz) for studying the spectral properties of different remnant regions and better constraining the models that describe their non-thermal emission from radio to $\\gamma$-ray wavelengths. We studied the integrated radio spectrum of the SNR Kes 73 using single-dish observations performed with the Sardinia Radio Telescope (SRT) between 6.9 and 24.8 GHz, complemented by published data. The high-resolution map at 24.8 GHz was used to search for spatial variations in the spectral index across the remnant. We present the SRT images of Kes 73, providing the highest-frequency morphological and spectral characterization ever obtained for this source. By combining our 18.7 and 24.8 GHz maps with previously published interferometric images at 1.4 and 5 GHz, we identify a flatter spectrum in the western bright region compared to the rest of the shell. In the same region, we detect overlapping $^12$CO molecular emission and $\\gamma$-ray radiation, providing strong evidence of SNR-molecular cloud interaction and enhanced CR production. We modelled the non-thermal radio to $\\gamma$-ray emission from this region, favouring a lepto-hadronic scenario with a maximum electron energy of 1.1 TeV and a magnetic field strength of 25 $\\mu$G.",

The nebula was proposed to be the remnant of a white dwarf merger that occurred in 1181CE.

The radio surface brightness of Pa 30 is $\\sim 3$ orders of magnitude smaller than that of typical supernova remnants (SNRs) with comparable angular size. If Pa 30 is an SNR, our observations show it to be the faintest known in the radio band.

There is also an indication of inefficient CR acceleration for this source.

Published in Nature Astronomy at this https URL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The product of a compact star merger is usually hypothesized to be a hyperaccreting black hole, typically resulting in a gamma-ray burst (GRB) with a duration shorter than 2~s. However, recent observations of GRB~211211A and GRB~230307A, both arising from compact star mergers, challenge this model due to their minute-long durations. The data from both events are consistent with having a nascent, rapidly spinning highly magnetized neutron star (a millisecond magnetar) as the merger product and GRB engine, but a smoking gun signature is still missing. Here we report strong but not yet conclusive evidence for the detection of a 909-Hz gamma-ray periodic signal during a brief time window of GRB~230307A, which is consistent with the rotation frequency of such a millisecond magnetar. Notably, the periodic signal appeared for only 160~ms at an epoch coinciding with the transition epoch when the jet emission from the GRB central engine ceased and when the delayed emission from high latitudes started. If this signal is real, the temporal and spectral features of this gamma-ray periodicity can be consistently interpreted as asymmetric mini-jet emission from a dissipating Poynting-flux-dominated jet, as revealed by the energy-dependent light curve data of this burst.",

The radio module autonomously handles electric field calculations and propagation to observer locations. It supports simultaneous simulations with both the ``Endpoint formalism'' as implemented in CoREAS and the ``ZHS'' algorithm from ZHAireS. In this contribution, we validate the radio module by comparing air-shower simulations in CORSIKA 8, CORSIKA 7, and ZHAireS. We investigate the impact of simulation parameters, such as the step size of particle tracks, on the resulting radio signals and perform a detailed comparison of the ``Endpoints'' and ``ZHS'' formalisms. For the same underlying showers simulated with CORSIKA 8 with optimized step sizes, both formalisms converge to the same radiation energy within 2%. For CORSIKA 8 and CORSIKA 7, agreement on the radiation energy is better than 10% in the 30-80 MHz band and improves to better than 2% for 50-350 MHz. This consistency provides further confirmation of the accuracy of microscopic air-shower radio emission simulations which is crucial for precise energy scale estimations using radio detection.",

A one-day flight over Australia resulted in a significant gamma-ray detection in the light curve and revealed a $7.9\\sigma$ excess in the image map from the Galactic center region. These results, obtained through a simple and unambiguous analysis, demonstrate the high reliability and sensitivity of the ETCC and establish its potential for future high-precision MeV gamma-ray observations. The measured intensity and spatial distribution were tested against three emission models: a single point-like source, a multi-component structure, and a symmetric two-dimensional Gaussian. All models were found to be statistically consistent with the data. The positronium-related flux in the multi-component model is $(3.2~\\pm~1.4)~\\times~10^{-2}$ photons cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, which is approximately a factor of two higher than the value reported by INTEGRAL, with a discrepancy at the $2\\sigma$ level. This difference may arise from unresolved sources or truly diffuse emission, such as exotic processes involving light dark matter or primordial black holes.",

Major achievements obtained so far include the unprecedented precise energy spectrum and its features, the observables linked to the UHECR mass composition and the distribution of arrival directions of the most energetic events. These results, together with the non-observation of high-energy neutrinos and photons, strongly disfavor the pre-Auger pure-proton paradigm. In this talk, we will provide an overview on the main results of the Observatory, and describe possible astrophysical scenarios for their interpretation.

We are focusing on non-detections and providing the most extensive set of very-high-energy (VHE, >100 GeV) upper limits to date. We use this catalogue to constrain the properties of VHE-detected GRBs and compare them to those detected at VHE. Our study finds that VHE-detected GRBs are not a distinct population but are instead associated with bright X-ray afterglows and low redshifts. In addition, we model the multi-wavelength emission of a few of the observed GRBs and discuss the results in the context of their obtained microphysical parameters. The results from this work help put current VHE observations into perspective and highlight the capabilities of next-generation instruments, in detecting fainter and more distant GRBs at VHE.",

Keith, Patrick Weltevrede, Geoffrey Wright, Bhaswati Bhattacharyya, JuiAn Hsu, Xiaoxi Song Submitted to MNRAS, under review High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a detailed analysis of sub-pulse modulations in nine pulsars which show evidence of changes in sub-pulse drift direction as a function of pulse longitude in the Thousand Pulsar Array single pulse survey with MeerKAT. We confirm that all of these are consistent with persistent drift direction changes. These 'bi-drifting' pulsars present a challenge to the classical carousel model for sub-pulse drifting. In general, bi-drifting in this expanded sample is less clear than some of the previously published cases, which we attribute to narrower profile widths ($<20$ degrees) or smaller $P_3$ values (close to 2$P$). However, given the broad variety of pulse shapes and drift behaviours across the pulsar population, it is unsurprising that the phenomenon is not limited to only those where it can most easily be detected. Four of our samples show at least two emission modes with different profile shapes and drift properties, which seems to be a relatively common feature of bi-drifting pulsars. We also find jumps in sub-pulse phase between adjacent components in two pulsars. In addition to our MeerKAT L-band data, we used GMRT observations for four, and MeerKAT UHF observations for two of these pulsars to investigate the frequency dependence of sub-pulse drift. We find subtle changes in the drift as a function of frequency, but no clear overall pattern. Looking at the distribution of bi-drifting pulsars over $P$, $\\dot{P}$ and $P_3$ suggests they are consistent with the underlying population of all drifting pulsars.",

In detached massive binaries, spherically symmetric accretion takes place. This accretion could result in effective energy release in the hard band only if the equipartition of the gravitational and magnetic energy of plasma is established (Shvartsmans theorem). However, we show that due to the magnetic exhaust effect this equilibrium is virtually never established for the actual magnetic fields observed on massive stars: Shvartsmans theorem does not work. As a result, it is virtually impossible to detect black holes in detached massive binaries by currently available means (mainly, through X-ray observations).",

The question remains: can a strange star maintain such a high surface temperature for a long time? To answer this question we studied thermal evolution of newborn strange star taking into account thermal conductivity of free quarks and neutrino emission by the URCA process. Our results show that extremely high luminosity due to the Schwinger process and insufficient thermal conductivity of quarks leads to development of steep temperature gradient at the surface of strange star. As a result, the temperature at the surface and hence its luminosity decreases as a power law, reaching $10^{40}$ erg/s already at 10 ms. This result holds even in the presence of neutrinosphere.",

Comments welcome Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th) The Gross-Pitaevskii equation is widely used for vortex dynamics, but finite domains with hard walls or confining potentials distort bulk behavior through vortex-image effects or induced flows. Periodic boundaries reduce wall artifacts yet cannot realize finite net vorticity because of topological obstruction, so bulk simulations with non-zero circulation are typically unavailable. Hence, we impose quasi-periodic boundary conditions that keep the superfluid's density periodic while enforcing phase windings consistent with a net prescribed total vorticity. This setting conserves the net number of vortices and enables long-time tracking of vortex trajectories in settings that finite containers cannot capture. This allows us to study vortex depinning and nucleation leading to the creation of Kármán vortex streets and the creation of perfectly periodic vortex arrays. The framework also provides a toy model for studying vortex dynamics in the bulk of neutron stars, free of possible limitations induced by confining potentials.",

This hybrid design provides both excellent sensitivity and a sub-degree pointing resolution. To design HERON, a suite of simulations accounting for tau propagation, shower development, radio emission, and antenna response were used. These simulations were used to discover the array layout which provides maximum sensitivity at 100 PeV, as well to select the optimal antenna design. Additionally, the event reconstruction accuracy has been tested for various designs of the sparse array via simulated interferometry.

It will be particularly suited to analyse transients and variable phenomena, which will trigger real-time scientific alerts. To support this, the Science Alert Generation (SAG) pipeline within the Array Control and Data Acquisition (ACADA) system will process data from telescope arrays in real time, using dedicated pipelines for data reconstruction (SAG-RECO), data quality monitoring (SAG-DQ) and science monitoring (SAG-SCI). The Supervisor (SAG-SUP) oversees the dynamic operations of SAG and its integration with other ACADA components. SAG is designed to issue candidate science alerts within 20 s of data availability, processing events on multiple time scales (seconds to hours) and handling trigger rates of tens of kHz. Meeting these requirements necessitates optimised software and hardware architectures. This work presents recent developments in SAG's architecture, aimed at two main challenges: (1) selecting data only from telescopes that have entered a stable tracking state, even when they begin tracking at different times during multi-telescope observations, and (2) incorporating environmental and system monitoring information to ensure high data quality. SAG-SUP can retrieve real-time telescope status and environmental conditions from telescope managers and the weather station through the ACADA Monitoring system, collect them in a database and then use them to filter out data from slewing phases or degraded conditions. These enhancements are crucial to ensure the reliability of science alerts and improve the overall performance and responsiveness of the CTAO real-time analysis framework.",

Sathyaprakash 15 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a series of five new broadband X-ray observations of the ultraluminous X-ray source Holmberg IX X-1, performed by $XMM$-$Newton$ and $NuSTAR$ in coordination. The first three of these show high soft X-ray fluxes but a near total collapse of the high-energy ($\\gtrsim$15 keV) emission, previously seen to be surprisingly stable across all prior broadband observations of the source. The latter two show a recovery in hard X-rays, remarkably once again respecting the same stable high-energy flux exhibited by all of the archival observations. We also present a joint analysis of all broadband observations of Holmberg IX X-1 to date (encompassing 11 epochs in total) in order to investigate whether it shows the same luminosity-temperature behaviour as NGC 1313 X-1 (which also shows a stable high-energy flux), whereby the hotter disc component in the spectrum exhibits two distinct, positively-correlated tracks in the luminosity-temperature plane. Holmberg IX X-1 may show similar behaviour, but the results depend on whether the highest energy emission is assumed to be an up-scattering corona or an accretion column. The strongest evidence for this behaviour is found in the former case, while in the latter the new 'soft' epochs appear distinct from the other high-flux epochs. We discuss possible explanations for these new 'soft' spectra in the context of the expected structure of super-Eddington accretion flows around black holes and neutron stars, and highlight a potentially interesting analogy with the recent destruction and re-creation of the corona seen in the AGN 1ES 1927+654.",

In this work we characterize the X-ray emission of the Galactic Center (GC) region using wide-field observations with the ART-XC telescope on board the SRG observatory in the 4-12 keV energy band. Our analysis demonstrates that the X-ray emission of the GC at a spatial scale of a few hundred parsecs is dominated by the regularly shaped NSD aligned in the Galactic plane, and characterized by latitudinal and longitudinal scale heights of approximately 20 pc and approximately 100 pc, respectively. The measured flux, 6.8 (+0.1, -0.3) x 10^-10 erg/s/cm^2 in the 4-12 keV band, corresponds to a luminosity of 5.9 (+0.1, -0.3) x 10^36 erg/s, assuming the GC distance of 8.178 kpc. The average mass-normalized X-ray emissivity of the NSD, 5.6 (+0.5, -0.7) x 10^27 erg/s/M_sun, exceeds the corresponding value of the Galactic ridge by a factor of 3.3 (+0.4, -0.5), confirming other studies. We also perform a deprojection of the observed NSD surface brightness distribution in order to construct a three-dimensional X-ray luminosity density model, which can be directly compared to the existing 3D stellar mass models. Finally, we conclude that the spatial distribution of the X-ray emission from the NSD is consistent with the most recent stellar mass density distribution model within 30%, which suggests that this emission is dominated by unresolved point X-ray sources rather than by diffuse X-ray emission.",

The CORSIKA 8 framework is being developed as a modern, flexible, and efficient tool for simulating these interactions with a variety of high-energy hadronic models. We present the ongoing implementation and validation of Pythia 8/Angantyr within CORSIKA 8. Pythia 8, successfully used in collider physics, provides a detailed and well-tested treatment of hadronic interactions, while the Angantyr model extends its capabilities to describe heavy-ion collisions in a consistent manner. With the inclusion of Pythia 8, the CORSIKA 8 suite now enables further tuning possibilities, improving the exploration of hadronic interactions in air showers. In this contribution, we compare the capability of Pythia 8/Angantyr to reproduce fundamental observables of high-energy particle collisions $-$ inelastic cross-sections and multiplicities $-$ to that of several established high-energy interaction models in air shower simulations. We further compare the predictions for key air shower properties, including longitudinal shower development and muon content, for iron-induced shower.",

Here we obtain deep ultraviolet (UV) imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) of the Type Ic SN 2012fh to search for the presence of a surviving companion star to the progenitor. We synthesize these observations with archival HST imaging, ground-based spectroscopy, and previous analyses from the literature to provide three independent constraints on the progenitor system. We fit the color-magnitude diagram of the surrounding population to constrain the most likely age of the system to be $<20$ Myr. Analysis of spectra of SN 2012fh provide an estimate of the He core mass of the progenitor star, $>5.6$ M$_{\\odot}$. We analyze deep HST images at the precise location after the SN faded to constrain the luminosity of any remaining main-sequence binary companion to be $\\log(L/L_{\\odot}) \\lesssim 3.35$. Combining observational constraints with current binary population synthesis models excludes the presence of a faint stellar companion to SN 2012fh at the $\\lesssim10\\%$ level. The progenitor was therefore either effectively isolated at the time of explosion or orbited by a black-hole companion. The latter scenario dominates if we only consider models that produce successful supernovae.",

These data provide an unprecedented view of the galaxy interstellar medium (ISM), and allow us to resolve ionised nebulae at a spatial scale of $\\approx$5 pc. We identify and catalogue 124 HII regions, down to H$\\alpha$ luminosities of $\\approx 5\\times$10$^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$, one order of magnitude fainter than previous surveys on local galaxies, and compare these regions with the spatial distribution of ionising stars and embedded star clusters. For each region, we extract the corresponding integrated optical spectra and measured the intensity of key optical emission lines (H$\\beta$, [OIII], [NII], H$\\alpha$, [SII], [SIII], other weaker optical lines when detectable, and Paschen lines) to characterize their physical properties of the ioinized gas such as density, dust attenuation, and metallicity. Our spatially resolved line ratio and flux maps reveal remarkable diversity in ionisation properties, from dust-obscured regions hosting young stellar objects to highly ionised bubbles exhibiting high [OIII]/H$\\beta$ ratios (>5). Our data reveal a diversity of ionisation fronts, ranging from well-defined to partial to absent. Radial profiles indicate the presence of both optically thin (density-bounded) and optically thick (radiation-bounded) HII regions. Our study highlights the richness of this MUSE mosaic and their unparalleled view of the ISM. In particular, the ability to probe the ISM at $\\approx$ 5 pc resolution opens a new window onto the complex structure of the ionised gas, enabling direct insight into how stellar feedback operates on the scales where it originates.",

Weatherford, Ana Bonaca 24 pages, 2 Tables, 16 Figures (9 in Appendix to appear as Figure Sets in journal), submitted to ApJ. Comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Velocity dispersion ($\\sigma$) in stellar streams from globular clusters (GCs) is sensitive to heating by Galactic substructure, including dark matter (DM) subhalos. Recent studies have compared $\\sigma$ in observed and modeled streams to probe DM properties, but have relied on stream models that neglect strong encounters, black holes (BHs), and mass segregation in GCs. Such phenomena may inflate stream $\\sigma$ or introduce selection effects -- e.g., a $\\sigma$ that depends on star mass ($m$). We investigate this prospect using Monte Carlo $N$-body simulations of GCs under static Galactic tides to generate mock streams with realistic mass and velocity distributions. We find $\\sigma$ correlates with $m$, especially after core collapse (the GC's observable increase in central density upon ejecting its BHs), rising from $1.2$--$2.2\\,{\\rm km\\,s}^{-1}$ between $m=0.3$--$0.8\\,M_\\odot$, with typical kinematic cuts on stream membership. Similar in magnitude to heating by Galactic substructure, this enhancement occurs because the GC's loss of BHs allows its most-massive stars to occupy its dense center, raising their likelihood of strong ejection via binary interactions and adding broad, exponential wings to the stream's velocity distribution. Streams' kinematics thus probe properties (density, BH retention) of their progenitor GCs. Our results also imply observations of streams from some GCs, especially those not subject to highly episodic mass loss, may select for higher $\\sigma$ than predicted by models neglecting $\\sigma$'s $m$-dependence. This would cause observed $\\sigma$ in streams -- already on the low side of expectations for cold DM -- to further favor alternatives such as warm, ultralight, or self-interacting DM.",

Wilhelm 28 pages, 10 figures in the main paper, 3 appendices with 4 additional figures. Submitted to AJ. Comments welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Stars form in clusters from the gravitational collapse of giant molecular clouds, which is opposed by a variety of physical processes, including stellar feedback. The interplay between these processes determines the star formation rate of the clouds. To study how feedback controls star formation, we use a numerical framework that is optimized to simulate star cluster formation and evolution. This framework, called Torch, combines the magnetohydrodynamical code FLASH with N-body and stellar evolution codes in the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment (AMUSE). Torch includes stellar feedback from ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, stellar winds, and supernovae, but, until now, did not include protostellar jets. We present our implementation of protostellar jet feedback within the Torch framework and describe its free parameters. We then demonstrate our new module by comparing cluster formation simulations with and without jets. We find that the inclusion of protostellar jets slows star formation, even in clouds of up to M $= 2 \\times 10^4$ M$_{\\odot}$. We also find that the star formation rate of our lower mass clouds (M $= 5 \\times 10^3$ M$_{\\odot}$) is strongly affected by both the inclusion of protostellar jets and the chosen jet parameters, including the jet lifetime and injection velocity. We follow the energy budget for each simulation and find that the inclusion of jets systematically increases the kinetic energy of the gas at early times. The implementation of protostellar jet feedback in Torch opens new areas of investigation regarding the role of feedback in star cluster formation and evolution.",

We also incorporate a probabilistic assignment of the fraction of the IR emission that is due to an AGN. Our simulations successfully reproduce the observed MIRI source number counts, redshift distributions, and AGN population fractions. We find that AGN dominate at bright flux densities $(S_\\nu \\gtrsim 20\\, \\mu \\rm Jy$ while main sequence galaxies dominate at the faint end.

The merger of G1 low-mass main-sequence (MS) binaries can overcome (i), but its ability to result in AALE is omitted. We provide evidence of the merger process to explain AALE by relying on highly probable merger remnants in the Galactic disk. We focus on carbon-deficient red-clump giants with low mass of 1.0 M_{\\sun} < M $\\lesssim$ 2.0 M_{\\sun} and hot He-intermediate subdwarfs of supersolar metallicity, both manifesting G2-like AALE incompatible with GC origin. The origin of such rare core He-burning stars as the mergers of [MS star (MSS)]+[helium white dwarf (HeWD)] binaries, evolved from low-mass high-mass ratio (MSS+MSS) ones, is supported by models evolving to either horizontal branch (HB) stars or He subdwarfs via the red giant branch (RGB). Such binaries in the GC NGC 362 contain very young ($\\sim$ 4 Myr) extremely low-mass HeWDs, in contrast to much older ($\\sim 100$ times) counterparts in open clusters. This agrees with the impact of GC environment on the lifetime of hard binaries: (MSS+HeWD) systems merge there soon after arising from (MSS+MSS) binaries that underwent the common-envelope stage of evolution. From the number and lifetime of the (MSS+HeWD) binaries uncovered in NGC 362, the expected fraction of their progeny RGB G2 stars is estimated to be $\\lesssim$10\\%. The field merger remnants with G2-like AALE support the merger nature of at least a fraction of G2 stars in GCs. The specific channel [(MSS+MSS) - (MSS+HeWD) - merger product] supported by observations and models is tentatively identified as the channel of formation of the extreme G2 RGB component in GCs.",

They were identified in our search for compact stellar overdensities in the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System 1, supported by follow-up deep photometric imaging from the Gran Telescopio Canarias OSIRIS instrument and Gaia astrometric data. These three new Milky Way satellites are found as compact stellar overdensities that exhibit structural and photometric properties consistent with old, metal-poor populations. All three are best described by isochrone fits corresponding to an age of ~12 Gyr and subsolar metallicities: [Fe/H] ~ -1.5 for Yasone-1 and Yasone-2, and [Fe/H] ~ -2.0 for Yasone-3.

Yasone-3, located at 15 kpc, is the faintest and least massive of the three, with M$_{V}$ = +2.52, a stellar mass of 14.4 M$_{\\odot}$, and a half-light radius of 2.09 pc. We also report a fourth (Yasone-4), lower-confidence hypercompact candidate located at Galactic latitude (b ~ 48$^{\\circ}$), identified by replicating our search using the photometric catalogue of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program Public Release. Finally, we present the discovery of sixteen (Yasone-5 to Yasone-20) new hypercompact cluster candidates in the Galactic disc. We discuss the possibility that any of the Yasone clusters may host an intermediate-mass black hole, and we advocate for follow-up spectroscopic observations to further constrain their nature.",

Baum (University of Manitoba) Submitted for the Proceedings of the IAU symposium 394: \"All-inclusive AGN\", contributed talk, 5 pages, 1 figure Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a review of our findings on the origin, drivers, nature, and impact of kiloparsec-scale radio emission in radio-quiet (RQ) AGN. Using radio polarimetric techniques, we probe the dynamics and magnetic (B-) field geometry of outflows in Seyfert and LINER galaxies. Multi-band data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) reveal how low-power jets interact with their environment. These interactions can slow down and disrupt the radio outflows while locally regulating star formation through AGN feedback. Several radio properties correlate strongly with the black hole mass, similar to trends observed in radio-loud (RL) AGN. Although their characteristics differ, RQ systems might not be intrinsically distinct from RL AGN, apart from lower jet powers. Our polarization measurements further suggest a composite model in which a black hole-accretion disk system drives both a collimated jet with a small-pitch-angle helical B-field and a wide-angle wind threaded by a high-pitch-angle helical field.",

Patton, Mary Putman, Jingyao Zhu 10 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ Letters Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present interferometric radio observations of the neutral atomic gas in AGC 727130, a low-mass, gas-rich, field galaxy lacking significant star-formation. The atomic gas in AGC 727130 displays a pronounced asymmetry, extending well beyond the stellar disk in one direction while remaining relatively undisturbed in the other. Despite proximity to a pair of interacting dwarfs, tidal analysis suggests these neighboring galaxies are not responsible for this pronounced asymmetry. Instead, using a topological cosmic web filament finder on spectroscopic catalogue data, we find AGC 727130 lies at the intersection of several large-scale cosmic web filaments, environments predicted to host diffuse, shock-heated gas. We propose that an interaction with this ambient medium is stripping gas from the galaxy via cosmic web ram-pressure stripping. This mechanism, supported by recent simulations, may quench low-mass galaxies outside of massive halos, and must be accounted for when comparing observed numbers of dwarf galaxies to theoretical predictions.",

Using multi-scale (40-2500 au) observations of an MDC hosting an HMYSO, we identify a coherent dynamical structure analogous to barred spiral galaxies: three 20,000 au spiral arms feed a 7,500 au central bar, which channels gas to a 2,000 au pseudodisk. Further accretion proceeds through the inner structures, including a Keplerian disk and an inner disk (100 au), which are thought to be driving a collimated bipolar outflow. This is the first time that these multi-scale structures (spiral arms, bar, streamers, envelope, disk, and outflow) have been simultaneously observed as a physically coherent structure within an MDC. Our discovery suggests that well-organized hierarchical structures play a crucial role during the gas accretion and angular momentum build-up of a massive disk.",

We present a multipole-frequency decomposition to evaluate the orbit-averaged energy and angular momentum dissipation experienced by a point mass on periodic orbits within a homogeneous, fluid-like background. Our focus is on eccentric Keplerian trajectories. Although our approach is currently restricted to linear response theory, it is fully consistent within that framework. We validate our theoretical expressions for the specific case of an ideal fluid, using semi-numerical simulations of the linear response acoustic wake. We demonstrate that, for a finite time perturbation switched on at t=0, a steady dissipation state is reached after a time bounded by twice the sound crossing time of the apocentre distance. We apply our results to model the secular evolution of compact eccentric binaries in a gaseous medium, assuming low-density conditions where the orbital elements evolve adiabatically. For unequal-mass systems with moderate initial eccentricity, the late-time eccentricity growth is significantly delayed compared to the equal-mass case, due to the binary components becoming transonic at different times along their orbital trajectory. Our approach offers a computationally efficient alternative to full simulations of the linear response wake.",

ROHSA-SNAPD utilises kinematic regularisation to forward model the intrinsic emission-line flux and kinematics (velocity and linewidth) of 3D data cubes. Kinematic regularisation removes the need to assume an underlying rotation model (eg. exponential disc, tilted-ring) to deconvolve kinematic data. We evaluate the code on mock observations of simulated galaxies: one idealised disc model and three more complex galaxies from a cosmological simulation with varying levels of kinematic disturbance, from pre-merger to post-merger state. The mock observations are designed to approximate published results at $z\\sim 1-2$ from 8-metre class near-infrared spectroscopic facilities, using realistic observational parameters including spatial and spectral resolution, noise and point spread function. We demonstrate that ROHSA-SNAPD can effectively recover the intrinsic kinematics of complex systems whilst accounting for observational effects. ROHSA-SNAPD is publicly released on Github.",

Watts 4 pages, 3 figures, submitted to A&A Letters Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Disentangling the (co-)evolution of individual galaxy structural components remains a difficult task owing to the inability to cleanly isolate light from spatially overlapping components. In this pilot study of PGC 044931, observed as part of the GECKOS survey, we utilise VIRCAM $H$-band imaging to decompose the galaxy into five photometric components, three of which contribute $>50\\%$ of light in given regions: a main disc, a boxy/peanut bulge, and a nuclear disc. When the photometric decompositions are mapped onto MUSE observations, we find remarkably good separation in stellar kinematic space. All three structures occupy unique locations in the parameter space of the ratio of stellar line-of-sight velocity ($\\rm{V}_{\\star}$) and dispersion, ($\\sigma_{\\star}$), and high order stellar skew, ($h_{3}$). These clear and distinct kinematic signatures give us confidence to make inferences about the formation history of the individual components from observations of the mean light-weighted stellar age and metallicity of the three components. A clear story emerges: one in which an extended galactic disc hosted continued star formation, possibly with the addition of accreted pristine gas. Within the disc, a bar formed and buckled early, building a nuclear disc that continued to enrich via multiple generations of star formation. These results exemplify how careful photometric decompositions, combined with well-resolved stellar kinematic information, can help separate out age-metallicity relations of different components and therefore disentangle the formation history of the galaxy. The results of this pilot survey are applicable to modern, well-resolved spectroscopic galaxy surveys.",

We visually inspect 26,621 spectra in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 that are selected in this way. We further inspect the 11,848 images corresponding to these spectra in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 10, and obtain 2046 conventional strong gravitational lens candidates, of which 1906 are new. This constitutes the largest sample of lens candidates identified to date in spectroscopic data. Besides the conventional candidates, we identify a new class of systems that we term \"dimple lenses\". These systems have a low-mass foreground galaxy as a lens, typically smaller in angular extent and fainter compared with the lensed background source galaxy, producing subtle surface brightness indentations in the latter. We report the discovery of 318 of these \"dimple-lens\" candidates. We suspect that these represent dwarf galaxy lensing. With follow-up observations, they could offer a new avenue to test the cold dark matter model by probing their mass profiles, stellar mass-halo mass relation, and halo mass function for $M_{\\textrm{Halo}} \\lesssim 10^{13}\\,M_\\odot$.

Six of our targets -- the primary sample -- are massive, UV-luminous galaxies drawn from the REBELS survey, while the remaining two are UV-fainter galaxies that were previously serendipitously detected through their luminous [CII] lines in the REBELS fields. We detect [OIII]$_{88}$ emission in all eight galaxies at $6.2 - 17.7\\sigma$ significance, and find them to be consistent with the local dwarf galaxy relation between $L_\\mathrm{[OIII]}$ and star formation rate. Our sample spans [OIII]/[CII] $\\approx 1.9 - 9.6$, which is typical for the high-redshift galaxy population. Five of the primary targets benefit from JWST/NIRSpec observations, enabling a direct comparison of the [OIII]/[CII] ratio against rest-optical ISM diagnostics. We supplement our high-redshift sample with eleven $z\\approx6-14$ galaxies in the literature for which similar ALMA and JWST observations are available, and furthermore compare to the [OIII]/[CII] ratios measured for local dwarf galaxies. We find that, at fixed metallicity and ionization parameter, $z>6$ galaxies show elevated [OIII]/[CII] ratios compared to local dwarfs. Instead, we find that a large [OIII]$_{4959,5007}$+H$\\beta$ equivalent width -- a proxy for burstiness -- is the main driver of the high [OIII]/[CII] ratios seen in the early Universe, which is primarily due to [CII] being suppressed in bursty galaxies. Given the apparent validity of the [OIII]$_{88}$-SFR relation across most of cosmic time, as well as the abundance of young, bursty galaxies at high redshift, [OIII]$_{88}$ is set to remain a powerful ISM tracer at the cosmic dawn.",

Jiménez-Serra, S. Viti, A. Lorenzani Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics (A&A) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The study of the chemical composition of star-forming regions is key to understand the chemical ingredients available during the formation of planetary systems. Given that the chemical inventory on interstellar dust grains in the prestellar phases might be altered due to the prostostellar warm-up, an alternative to infer the chemical composition on the grains could be to observe regions affected by shocks associated with molecular outflows. Such shocks can desorb the molecules, and might produce less chemical processing due to shorter timescales. We present here a detailed study of the chemical reservoir of a shocked region located in the G31.41+0.31 protocluster using GUAPOS data (G31.41+0.31 Unbiased ALMA sPectral Observational Survey). We report here the detection of 30 molecular species (plus 18 isotopologues). We performed a comparison of the molecular ratios in the shocked region with those derived towards the hot core of G31.41+0.31, finding that they are poorly correlated, excepting N-bearing species. Our results confirm observationally that a different level of chemical alteration is present in hot cores and in shocks. While the former likely alter the molecular ratios due to thermal processing during longer timescales, the latter might represent freshly desorbed material that constitutes a better proxy of the icy mantle composition. The similarity of molecular ratios between the N-bearing species in the G31.41 shock and the hot core suggests that these species are desorbed at early evolutionary stages. Interestingly, we have found that the abundances in the G31.41 shock show better correlations with other shock-dominated regions (two protostellar outflows and a Galactic Center molecular cloud). This suggests a negligible gas-phase chemistry after shock-induced ejection from grains, and that the ice-mantle composition is similar regardless of the Galactic environment.",

Wilkins, Christopher C. Lovell, Shihong Liao, Louise T. C. Seeyave 15 pages, 12 figures, submitted to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 (RQG) is the earliest massive quiescent galaxy identified to date, inferred to have formed its abundant stellar mass in a single burst that ceases rapidly before $z \\sim 8$. An object of such extreme nature challenges our understanding of galaxy formation, requiring rapid growth and quenching mechanisms only 0.6 Gyr after the Big Bang and implying number densities 2 dex higher than currently predicted by simulations. We use synthetic observables to identify analogous systems within the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) and find two massive galaxies dominated by rapidly quenched bursts. Beyond demonstrating that the current FLARES model is capable of producing RQG-like systems, these analogues provide a laboratory within which to study the underlying physics. Their active galactic nuclei (AGN) heat and expel gas, inducing rapid quenching and preventing timely rejuvenation. This causes above-average chemical enrichment at a given stellar mass, with super solar levels predicted for RQG. These metallicities are underestimated by spectral energy distribution fitting and we show that $\\alpha$-enhancement cannot be solely responsible. Degeneracies with age and dust attenuation appear the more likely causes. Tensions between observed and simulated number densities can be alleviated in part by considering systematics, but adjustments to AGN feedback, such as allowing super-Eddington accretion rates, may be required for full agreement.",

Kümmel 17 pages, 21 figures, Submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We introduce SpectraPyle, a versatile spectral stacking pipeline developed for the Euclid mission's NISP spectroscopic surveys, aimed at extracting faint emission lines and spectral features from large galaxy samples in the Wide and Deep Surveys. Designed for computational efficiency and flexible configuration, SpectraPyle supports the processing of extensive datasets critical to Euclid's non-cosmological science goals. We validate the pipeline using simulated spectra processed to match Euclid's expected final data quality. Stacking enables robust recovery of key emission lines, including Halpha, Hbeta, [O III], and [N II], below individual detection limits. However, the measurement of galaxy properties such as star formation rate, dust attenuation, and gas-phase metallicity are biased at stellar mass below log10(M*/Msol) ~ 9 due to the flux-limited nature of Euclid spectroscopic samples, which cannot be overcome by stacking. The SFR-stellar mass relation of the parent sample is recovered reliably only in the Deep survey for log10(M*/Msol) > 10, whereas the metallicity-mass relation is recovered more accurately over a wider mass range. These limitations are caused by the increased fraction of redshift measurement errors at lower masses and fluxes. We examine the impact of residual redshift contaminants that arises from misidentified emission lines and noise spikes, on stacked spectra. Even after stringent quality selections, low-level contamination (< 6%) has minimal impact on line fluxes due to the systematically weaker emission of contaminants. Percentile-based analysis of stacked spectra provides a sensitive diagnostic for detecting contamination via coherent spurious features at characteristic wavelengths. While our simulations include most instrumental effects, real Euclid data will require further refinement of contamination mitigation strategies.",

We find that the formation of these galaxies follows a two-phase pattern, with an early phase featured by hot dynamics, bulge-dominated structure and bursty star formation, and a later phase featured by cold dynamics, disk-dominated structure and steady star formation. The transition times of these galaxy properties are tightly correlated with the time when the host halo transits from fast to slow accretion, suggesting that the two-phase assembly of halos drive the two-phase formation of galaxies. The physical origin of dynamical hotness can be summarized into two modes of star formation: a scattered mode in which stars form at large radii within cold gas streams associated with fast assembly of halos, and a concentrated mode in which stars form at small radii through violent fragmentation from globally self-gravitated gas when halo assembly is about to slow down. Cold gaseous and stellar disks can form only when the conditions of the two modes are removed by the stall of halo assembly and the reduction of gas by feedback processes. The two modes of star formation leave distinct imprints on the structural properties of high-redshift galaxies, providing implications to be tested by JWST and future observations.",

Fernández-Trincado, Cesar Muñoz Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Context. The CAPOS project aims to obtain accurate mean abundances and radial velocities for many elements, and it explores the multiple population (MP) phenomenon in Galactic bulge globular clusters (BGCs). NGC 6569 is one of the CAPOS targets. Aims. This study provides a detailed high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of NGC 6569 to derive precise abundances for elements of different nucleosynthetic origins and to unveil its MPs by focusing on key spectral features. Methods. We analyzed APOGEE-2 near-infrared spectra of 11 giant members with the BACCHUS code, deriving abundances for 12 elements (C, N, O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, Ni, Al, Ce, Nd). Isochrone fitting with Gaia+2MASS photometry was used to estimate atmospheric parameters, cluster distance, and extinction. Results. We obtained [Fe/H] = -0.91 $\\pm$ 0.06, consistent with APOGEE pipeline values; the scatter lies within uncertainties. The cluster shows [$\\alpha$/Fe] = 0.36 $\\pm$ 0.06 dex, similar to other GCs. Al appears homogeneous, while N is strongly enriched ([N/Fe] = 0.68 $\\pm$ 0.34) with a spread of 0.90 dex, yielding two populations anticorrelated in C. The n-capture elements Ce and Nd are overabundant compared to the Sun but consistent with GCs of similar metallicity, with $\\langle$[Ce/Nd]$\\rangle$ = -0.17 $\\pm$ 0.12. We also measure RV = -49.75 $\\pm$ 3.68 km s$^{-1}$, consistent with previous works, while d$_\\odot$ = 12.4 $\\pm$ 1.45 kpc and E(B-V) = 0.68 are both higher than literature values. Conclusions. MPs in NGC 6569 are confirmed through a clear C-N anticorrelation. The cluster shows [$\\alpha$/Fe] enhancement from Type II SNe and no Mg-Al-Si anticorrelation, suggesting rapid and homogeneous formation. The $\\langle$[Ce/Nd]$\\rangle$ ratio points to contributions from r-process events such as neutron star mergers, while overall Ce and Nd abundances are reported here for the first time in this cluster.",

We analyze position-velocity diagrams for forbidden and permitted lines (92 and 93 lines in Hf 2-2 and M 1-42, respectively), to compare their kinematic behaviour and to determine the physical characteristics of the emitting plasma. We confirm that there are two plasma components in both nebulae: a normal nebular plasma that emits both forbidden and permitted lines and an additional plasma component that emits the permitted lines of O I, C II, N II, O II, and Ne II. These plasma components have different spatial distributions, with the additional plasma component being the more centrally concentrated. Their physical conditions are also different, with the additional plasma component being denser and cooler. We find that, in these objects, the additional plasma component contains masses of N$^{2}$ and O$^{2}$ ions that are at least as large as the normal nebular plasma. In both objects, we find strong gradients in the electron temperature in small volumes near the central star. Compared to NGC 6153, we find that the larger ADFs in Hf 2-2 and M 1-42 are due to larger masses of ions that emit only in the permitted lines, and not due to the physical conditions.",

Saydjari Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) SDSS-V will obtain 100,000s of medium-resolution, optical spectra of M dwarfs with the BOSS instrument. M dwarfs have complex atmospheres, and their spectra contain many wide and dense, overlapping molecular features, so determining accurate stellar parameters by fitting models has been difficult. To circumvent this, other surveys have employed machine learning methods to transfer measurements of stellar parameters from high-resolution spectra to their medium-resolution counterparts. These methods provide large catalogs of stellar parameters but, if not addressed properly, are plagued by biases which are, in part, due to the normalization of the spectra. Typical spectral normalization removes the continuum but preserves the relative depths of the absorption features, but optical M dwarf spectra are almost entirely made up of molecular absorption, which makes this difficult. Here, we develop a standardization method that instead defines a pseudo-continuum. We use the spectrum's alpha shape to find the points which lie between the absorption features and apply local polynomial regression to find this pseudo-continuum. To tune the hyperparameters of this method, we create BOSS-like spectra from BT-NextGen models to replicate instrumental, signal-to-noise, and reddening effects. We find that in both this generated set and a validation set of the SDSS-V data, our method performs better than alternative standardizations by producing spectra that are both more uniform for M dwarfs with similar stellar parameters and more easily distinguished compared to M dwarfs of differing parameters. These results from our method will be crucial for better determining stellar parameters of M dwarfs using generative models.",

PNe exhibit diverse morphologies, the origins of which are not fully understood. PNe with OH (OHPNe) and H$_{2}$O (H$_{2}$OPNe) masers are thought to be nascent PNe. However, the number of known OHPNe and H$_{2}$OPNe remains small, and only in eight cases the position of the maser emission has been found to coincide with the PN, using the high astrometric accuracy of interferometric observations. In order to identify more OHPNe and H$_{2}$OPNe, we used public databases and our own ATCA/VLA observations to match the positions of OH and H$_{2}$O masers with known PNe and radio continuum emitters, considering radio continuum emission as a possible tracer of the photoionized gas that characterizes PNe. Here we report the confirmation of positional coincidence of maser emission with one more PN, and 12 PN candidates. Moreover, we have confirmed three evolved stars as `water fountains' (WFs) hosting H$_2$O masers. These WFs are associated with radio continuum emission, but their possible nature as PNe has not yet been confirmed. Although a final characterization of maser-emitting PNe as a group still requires confirmation of more objects, their distribution in the infrared color-color diagrams suggests that they are a heterogeneous group of PNe. In particular, the new OHPN IRAS 07027$-$7934 has been reported to contain a late [WC]-type central star, while the maser emission implies an O-rich envelope. This property is found in only one other known maser-emitting PN, although we found evidence that other confirmed and candidate OHPNe may also have mixed chemistry, since they show emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The new WF IRAS 18443$-$0231 shows radio continuum that is dominated by strong and variable non-thermal emission, as in magnetized outflows.",

Yee submitted to AAS, 18 pages, 9 figures Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Gravitational microlensing is a unique method for discovering cold planets across a broad mass range. Reliable statistics of the microlensing planets require accurate sensitivity estimates. However, the impact of the degeneracies in binary-lens single-source (2L1S) models that affect many actual planet detections is often omitted in sensitivity estimates, leading to potential self-inconsistency of the statistics studies. In this work, we evaluate the effect of the 2L1S degeneracies on planetary sensitivity by simulating a series of typical microlensing events and comprehensively replicating a realistic planet detection pipeline, including the anomaly identification, global 2L1S model search, and degenerate model comparison. We find that for a pure-survey statistical sample, the 2L1S degeneracies reduce the overall planetary sensitivity by $5\\sim10\\%$, with the effect increasing at higher planet-host mass ratios. This bias leads to an underestimation of planet occurrence rates and a flattening of the inferred mass-ratio function slope. This effect will be critical for upcoming space-based microlensing surveys like the Roman or Earth 2.0 missions, which are expected to discover $\\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ planets. We also discuss the computational challenges and propose potential approaches for future applications.",

A little red dot at z = 7.3 within a large galaxy overdensity. Nat Astron (2025). this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The nature of \"Little Red Dots\" and their relation to other forms of accreting supermassive black holes remain an open question. Here we report the discovery of a Little Red Dot at $z=7.3$. It is attenuated by moderate amounts of dust, $A_V = {2.79}\\,\\textrm{mag}$, with an intrinsic bolometric luminosity of $10^{46.6}\\,\\textrm{erg}\\,\\textrm{s}^{-1}$ and a SMBH mass of $5\\times10^8\\,\\textrm{M}_\\odot$. Most notably, this object is embedded in an overdensity of eight nearby galaxies, allowing us to calculate a spectroscopic estimate of the clustering of galaxies around Little Red Dots. We find a Little Red Dot-galaxy cross-correlation length of $r_0\\!=\\!8\\pm2\\,\\textrm{h}^{-1}\\,\\textrm{cMpc}$, comparable to that of $z\\!\\sim\\!6$ UV-luminous quasars. The resulting estimate of their minimum dark matter halo mass of $\\log_{10}(M_{\\textrm{halo, min}}/\\textrm{M}_{\\odot})= 12.0_{-1.0}^{+0.8}$ indicates that nearly all halos above this mass must host actively accreting SMBHs at $z\\approx7$, in strong contrast with the far smaller duty cycle of luminous quasars ($<1\\%$). Our results, taken at face value, motivate a picture in which SMBHs in Little Red Dot phases could serve as the obscured precursors of UV-luminous quasars, which provides a natural explanation for the short UV-luminous lifetimes inferred from both quasar clustering and quasar proximity zones.",

Ho (PKU, KIAA), Wen Sun (PKU, KIAA) 21 pages, 16 figures, submitted to ApJ; v2 updated to match the accepted version Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We study the rest-frame ultraviolet-optical color gradients of 441 galaxies at $4<z<8$ by characterizing the wavelength dependence of their structural parameters derived from simultaneously fitting the seven-band NIRCam images acquired with the James Webb Space Telescope. Distinct from trends observed at lower redshifts, where most galaxies exhibit negative color gradients whereby galaxy centers are redder than their outskirts, in high-redshift galaxies positive color gradients are just as common as or even outnumber negative color gradients. Varying stellar population, dust, and active galactic nuclei can contribute to the observed color gradient. We show that for the majority of our sample, the observed color gradients principally reflect radial variations in stellar population, without strong contribution from dust reddening or contamination from active galactic nuclei. The sign and magnitude of the color profile depend systematically on the global properties of the galaxy: positive color gradients, characteristic of centrally concentrated star formation or outside-in growth, are found preferentially in galaxies of lower stellar mass, smaller size, and bluer spectral energy distribution.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) for a parent sample of 604 galaxies at $z=5.34-6.94$ with \\OIII\\ doublets detected, using the deep JWST/NIRCam wide field slitless spectroscopic (WFSS) observations in 26 quasar fields. The sample incorporates the full observations of 25 quasar fields from the JWST Cycle 1 GO program ASPIRE and the quasar SDSS J0100+2802 from the JWST EIGER program. We identify 204 galaxies residing in overdense structures using the friends-of-friends (FoF) algorithm. We estimate the electron temperature of $2.0^{+0.3}_{-0.4}\\times10^4$ K from the Hg and OIII4363 lines in the stacked spectrum, indicating a metal-poor sample with median gas phase metallicity 12+$\\log(\\mathrm{O/H})=7.65^{+0.26}_{-0.15}$. With the most up-to-date strong line calibration based on NIRSpec observations, we find that the MZR shows a metal enhancement of $\\sim0.2$ dex at the high mass end in overdense environments. However, compared to the local Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR), our galaxy sample at $z>5$ shows a metal deficiency of $\\sim0.2$ dex relative to FMR predictions. We explain the observed trend of FMR with a simple analytical model, favoring dilution from intense gas accretion over outflow to explain the metallicity properties at $z > 5$. Those high-redshift galaxies are likely in a rapid gas accretion phase, during which their metal and gas contents are in a non-equilibrium state. According to model predictions, the protocluster members are closer to the gas equilibrium state than field galaxies and thus have higher metallicity and are closer to the local FMR. Our results suggest that the accelerated star formation during protocluster assembly likely plays a key role in shaping the observed MZR and FMR, indicating a potentially earlier onset of metal enrichment in overdense environments at $z\\approx5-7$.",

This diversity is mostly explored using either broad-band photometry or high-resolution heterodyne spectroscopy. We aim to map the millimetre continuum emission of Galactic regions with an intermediate spectral resolution between broad-band photometry and heterodyne spectroscopy, enabling us to rapidly cover large sky areas with spectroscopy. We report observations of the Orion Nebula with the CONCERTO instrument, which was installed at the APEX telescope focal plane from 2021 to 2023. We find that the spectrum of Orion is dominated by dust emission with an emissivity index ranging between 1.3 and 2.0, along with strong CO(2-1) and H$_2$O lines, which are naturally separated from the continuum due to the CONCERTO spectral capabilities. Many regions also show strong free-free emission at lower frequencies. We demonstrate the spectral capabilities of CONCERTO at intermediate spectral resolution, with a frequency coverage from 130 to 310 GHz. A sensitivity of 200 mK is achieved in one second, for one beam and a 6 GHz frequency width, over an 18 arcmin diameter field of view, which is within a factor of three of the expectations. We show that we can spectrally disentangle the continuum from the CO line emission, but the line is not resolved at a resolution of $\\sim 8000\\ \\mathrm{km s^{-1}}$. The slope of the millimetre continuum is line-free mapped for the first time in Orion.",

Keane 9 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in ApJL Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, obtained with Gemini-S/GMOS and NASA IRTF/SpeX on 2025 July 5 and July 14. The optical spectrum shows a red slope of approximately 10% per 1000 angstroms between 0.5 and 0.8 microns, closely resembling that of typical D-type asteroids. At longer wavelengths, the near-infrared spectrum flattens significantly to approximately 3% per 1000 angstroms from 0.9 to 1.5 microns, consistent with the spectral behavior of large water ice grains in the coma. Spectral modeling with an areal mixture of 70% Tagish Lake meteorite and 30% 10-micron-sized water ice successfully reproduces both the overall continuum and the broad absorption feature near 2.0 microns. The 1.5-micron water ice band, however, is not detected, likely due to the limited signal-to-noise of the IRTF data and dilution by refractory materials. The ~30% ice fraction should be interpreted as an approximate, order-of-magnitude estimate of the coma composition. The agreement between the GMOS and SpeX spectra, taken nine days apart, suggests short-term stability in the coma's optical properties. Our observations reveal that 3I/ATLAS is an active interstellar comet containing abundant water ice, with a dust composition more similar to D-type asteroids than to ultrared trans-Neptunian objects.",

We report serendipitous Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observations of 3I/ATLAS taken between 2025-05-07 and 2025-06-02, 55 days prior to the discovery date (2025-07-01). We retrieve the TESS pixel data, perform a robust background correction and use a data-driven approach to compute the objects position on the TESS detectors. We find a consistent offset between the targets observed and predicted positions which is dominated by uncertainty in the TESS World Coordinate System (WCS) rather than ephemeris errors. 3I/ATLAS is too faint to be detected in the individual 200 second TESS integrations, so we stack images to improve detectability. We perform aperture and Pixel Response Function (PRF) photometry on the stacked images to create two light curves. Each light curve consists of 15 measurements with $\\text{SNR}>3$, collected across two different TESS cameras during the 26 days that the object was observed. The PRF light curve, which is more robust against image noise, in the TESS bandpass shows a gradual increase in brightness from $T_{\\text{mag}}=20.9\\pm0.29$ to $19.57\\pm0.15$. This is expected as 3I/ATLAS approaches the inner Solar System. Its absolute magnitude decreases from $H_{V}=14.3\\pm0.4$ to $13.7\\pm0.3$ and shows signs of faint activity consistent with other observations. This paper highlights the power of using TESS for Solar System science by increasing the number of pre-discovery observations, in an otherwise sparsely populated region of the light curve, the long-term behavior of 3I/ATLAS can be investigated.",

Humphreys, Kris Davidson 48 pages including 29 Figures and 12 tables. Accepted for publication in the ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We examine the spatial distributions of LBVs, B[e] supergiants, and W-R stars in the LMC, to clarify their relative ages, evolutionary states, and relationships. This survey employs a reference catalog that was not available for previous work, comprising more than 3900 of the LMC's most luminous stars. Our analysis shows that LBVs, B[e] supergiants, and WR's have spatial distributions like normal stars with the same spectral types and luminosities. Most LBVs are not isolated, nor do they require binary or multiple status to explain their spatial relationship to other populations. There are two likely exceptions: one lower-luminosity LBV and one LBV candidate are relatively isolated and may have velocities that require additional acceleration. The B[e] supergiants are spatially and kinematically more dispersed than LBVs, suggesting that they belong to an older population. The most luminous early-type WN's are most closely associated with the evolved late O-type supergiants. The high luminosity late WNs, and WNh stars however, are highly concentrated in the 30 Dor region which biases the analysis. The less luminous WNs and WCs are associated with a mix of evolved late B, A-type, and yellow supergiants which may be in a post-red-supergiant phase. Spatial distributions of the less luminous WN, WC, and WN3/O3 stars reinforce proposed evolutionary links among those subtypes. Our analysis also demonstrates the importance of using a comprehensive census, with reference populations clearly defined by spectral type and luminosity, and how small number statistics, especially combined with spatial clustering, can invalidate some commonly-cited statistical tests.",

Lynas-Gray, Johnathan Tennyson, Lingzhi Wang, Lixin Yu, Diego Benitez-Palacios, Jinyi Yang, Michael Kuhn, Sharon X. Wang Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Here we investigate an infrared eruptive source, identified from the decade-long VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea survey (VVV). We named this target after a group of variable sources discovered by VVV, as VVV-WIT-13, with WIT standing for \"What Is This?\", due to its unique photometric variation behaviour and the mysterious origin of the outburst. This target exhibited an outburst with a 5.7 mag amplitude in the Ks-band, remained on its brightness plateau for 3.5 years, and then rapidly faded to its pre-eruptive brightness afterwards. We aim to reveal the variable nature and outburst origin of VVV-WIT-13 by presenting our follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations along with theoretical models. We gathered photometric time series in both near- and mid-infrared wavelengths. We obtained near-infrared spectra during the outburst and decaying stages on XSHOOTER/VLT and FIRE/Magellan, and then fitted the detected molecular absorption features using models from ExoMol. We applied 2D numerical simulations to re-create the observables of the eruptive phenomenon. We observe deep AlO absorption bands in the infrared spectra of VVV-WIT-13, during the outburst stage, along with other more common absorption bands (e.g. CO). Our best-fit model suggests a 600 K temperature of the AlO absorption band. In the decaying stage, the AlO bands disappeared, whilst broad blue-shifted H2 lines arose, a common indicator of stellar wind and outflow. The observational evidence suggests that the CO and TiO features originate from an outflow or a wind environment. We find that VVV-WIT-13 is an eruptive young star with instability occurring in the accretion disk. One favoured theoretical explanation of this event is a disrupted gas clump at a distance of 3 au from the source. If confirmed, this would be the first such event observed in real time.",

Wijdeveld Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics. 19 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Post-RGB and post-AGB binaries consist of a primary star that has recently evolved off either the RGB or AGB after losing most of its envelope, and a main-sequence companion. They are distinguished by luminosities below and above the RGB tip, respectively. These systems host a stable, dusty circumbinary disc, characterised by a near-infrared excess. Observed Galactic post-AGB and post-RGB binaries have orbital periods and eccentricities inconsistent with binary population synthesis models. Here, we focus on post-RGB binaries, testing whether stable mass transfer can explain their orbital periods by comparing models with the known sample of 38 Galactic post-RGB binaries. We systematically determined luminosities of Galactic post-RGB and post-AGB binaries through SED fitting. We computed evolution models for low- and intermediate-mass binaries with RGB donors at two metallicities using MESA. We selected stable mass transfer models producing primaries with effective temperatures within the observed range. From these models, we find that low-mass post-RGB binaries should follow strict luminosity-orbital period relations. The Galactic post-RGB binaries seem consistent with these relations if their orbits remained eccentric during mass transfer and if the donor filled its Roche lobe at periastron. However, our models are unable to explain the eccentricities themselves. Moreover, post-mass-transfer ages from our models are much longer than predicted dissipation timescales of circumbinary discs. Stable mass transfer seems to explain the orbital periods of Galactic post-RGB binaries. This formation channel can be tested further by obtaining orbits of additional Galactic systems and Magellanic Cloud candidates via long-term radial velocity monitoring. Gaia DR 4 will improve luminosities of Galactic post-RGB binaries, enabling more accurate comparison with luminosity-orbital period relations.",

Here we present TESS and HiPERCAM $u_{s}g_{s}r_{s}i_{s}z_{s}$ observations of one of these stars LP 89--187 which has a rotation period of 0.117 d. TESS data covering three sectors (64.6 d) only show three flares which have energies a few $\\times10^{33}$ erg, whilst HiPERCAM observations, which cover 0.78 of the rotation period, show no evidence for flares more energetic than $\\sim10^{31}$ erg. Intriguingly, other surveys show LP 89--187 has shown weak H$\\alpha$ in emission. We compare the flare energy distribution of LP 89--187 with low mass stars in the $\\beta$ Pic moving group, which have an age of $\\sim$24 Myr. We find LP 89--187 has a lower flare rate than the $\\beta$ Pic stars. In addition, we find that TRAPPIST-1 analogue stars, which are likely significantly older than the $\\beta$ Pic stars, show fewer flares with energies $>10^{33}$ erg in TESS data. We examine the relationship between amplitude and period for a sample of low mass stars and find that more rapid rotators have a higher amplitude.",

The main ingredients for getting X-ray class flares and large interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are the build-up of electric current in the corona, the existence of magnetic free energy, magnetic energy/helicity ratio, twist, and magnetic stress in active regions (ARs). The upper limit of solar energy in the space research era, as well as the potential for experiencing superflares and extreme solar events, can be predicted using MHD simulations of CMEs. To address this problem, we consider the recent events of May 2024 and use three MHD models: 1) OHM (\"Observationally driven High order scheme Magnetohydrodynamic code\") for investigating the magnetic evolutions at a synthetic dipole structure. 2) TMF (time-dependent magneto-friction) for setting up an initial non-potential magnetic field in the active region. A zero-beta MHD model for tracing the magnetic evolution of active regions. 3) EUHFORIA (''European heliospheric forecasting information asset'') for interplanetary CME propagations. For the eruptive flares with CMEs, magnetic solar energy is computed along with data-constrained MHD simulations for the May 2024 events. We show the consistency between the data-initiated realistic simulation of the May 2024 big event and energy scalings from an idealised simulation of a bipolar eruption using OHM. The estimated free magnetic energy did not surpass $5.2 \\times 10^{32}\\;$erg. Good arrival time predictions ($<3$ hours) are achieved with the EUHFORIA simulation with the cone model. We note the interest in coupling all the chains of codes from the Sun to the Earth and developing different approaches to test the results.",

Understanding their physical properties is key to constraining their origin and the evolution of the outer regions beyond Neptune. Stellar occultations provide highly accurate size and shape information. (24835) 1995 SM55 is one of the few members of the Haumea cluster and thus of particular interest. We aimed to determine its projected size, absolute magnitude, and geometric albedo, and to compare these with Haumea. A stellar occultation on 25 February 2024 was observed from five sites, with seven positive detections and 33 negative chords. An elliptical fit to the occultation chords yields semi-axes of $(104.3 \\pm 0.4) \\times (83.5 \\pm 0.5)$ km, giving an area-equivalent diameter of $186.7 \\pm 1.8$ km, smaller than the 250 km upper limit from Herschel thermal data. Photometry provides an absolute magnitude $H_V = 4.55 \\pm 0.03$, a phase slope of $0.04 \\pm 0.02$ mag/deg, and a $V-R = 0.37 \\pm 0.05$. The rotational variability has an amplitude $\\Delta m = 0.05$ mag, but the period remains uncertain. Combining occultation and photometry, we derive a geometric albedo $p_V = 0.80 \\pm 0.04$, one of the highest values measured for a TNO. This value is slightly higher than that of Haumea, consistent with the interpretation that 1995 SM55 belongs to the Haumea cluster.",

Pietrow 22 pages, 13 figures, Published in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The distribution of close-in exoplanets is shaped by the interplay between atmospheric and dynamical processes. The Neptunian Desert, Ridge, and Savanna illustrate the sensitivity of these worlds to such processes, making them ideal to disentangle their roles. Determining how many Neptunes were brought close-in by early disk-driven migration (DDM; maintaining primordial spin-orbit alignment) or late high-eccentricity migration (HEM; generating large misalignments) is essential to understand how much atmosphere they lost. We propose a unified view of the Neptunian landscape to guide its exploration, speculating that the Ridge is a hot spot for evolutionary processes. Low-density Neptunes would mainly undergo DDM, getting fully eroded at shorter periods than the Ridge, while denser Neptunes would be brought to the Ridge and Desert by HEM. We embark on this exploration via ATREIDES, which relies on spectroscopy and photometry of 60 close-in Neptunes, their reduction with robust pipelines, and their interpretation through internal structure, atmospheric, and evolutionary models. We carried out a systematic RM census with VLT/ESPRESSO to measure the distribution of 3D spin-orbit angles, correlate its shape with system properties and thus relate the fraction of aligned-misaligned systems to DDM, HEM, and atmospheric erosion. Our first target, TOI-421c, lies in the Savanna with a neighboring sub-Neptune TOI-421b. We measured their 3D spin-orbit angles (Psib = 57+11-15 deg; Psic = 44.9+4.4-4.1 deg). Together with the eccentricity and possibly large mutual inclination of their orbits, this hints at a chaotic dynamical origin that could result from DDM followed by HEM. ATREIDES will provide the community with a wealth of constraints for formation and evolution models. We welcome collaborations that will contribute to pushing our understanding of the Neptunian landscape forward.",

Mid-infrared observations have revealed that these disks exhibit weak silicate features and strong hydrocarbon emissions. This study characterizes the dust properties and geometrical structures of VLMS and brown dwarf (BD) disks, observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), and connects these to gas column density and potential evolutionary stages. We analyze mid-infrared spectra of ten VLMS and BD disks as a part of the MIRI mid-Infrared Disk Survey (MINDS) program. Spectral slopes and silicate band strengths are compared with hydrocarbon emission line ratios, which probe the gas column density. Moreover, the Dust Continuum Kit with Line emission from Gas is used to quantify grain sizes, dust compositions, and crystallinity in the disk surface. The disks are classified into less, more, and fully settled geometries based on their mid-infrared spectral slopes and silicate band strengths. Less-settled disks show a relatively strong silicate band, high spectral slopes, and low crystallinity, and are dominated by 5 $\\mu$m-sized grains. More-settled disks have weaker silicate band, low spectral slope, enhanced crystallinity, and higher mass fractions of smaller grains. Fully-settled disks exhibit little or no silicate emission and negative spectral slopes. An overall trend of increasing gas column density with decreasing spectral slope suggests that more molecular gas is exposed when the dust opacity decreases due to dust settling. Our findings may reflect possible evolutionary pathways with dust settling and thermal processing or may point to inner-disk clearing or a collisional cascade. These results highlight the need for broader samples to understand the link between dust and gas appearance in regions where Earth-like planets form.",

Pawellek Accepted for publication in A&A (33 pages, 13 figures) Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Over the past fifteen years, surveys mainly at millimeter wavelengths have led to the discovery of $\\sim$20 gas-bearing debris disks, most of them surrounding young intermediate-mass stars. Exploring the properties and origin of this gas could be fundamental to better understanding the transition between the protoplanetary and debris disk phases, the evolution of icy planetesimal belts, and the formation of planetary atmospheres. To expand the list of known CO-bearing debris disks and to improve our knowledge of the environmental conditions under which they can form, we targeted twelve dust-rich debris disks around young ($<$50 Myr) intermediate-mass stars. Using the ALMA 12-m Array we performed millimeter continuum and CO line observations to search for dust and gas and to measure their quantity and spatial distribution. We discovered CO gas in five disks. Two of them have a low CO content of a few times 10$^{-5}$ M$_\\oplus$, similar to that of $\\beta$ Pic. The other three disks, however, are CO-rich with $M_\\mathrm{CO}>10^{-3}$ M$_\\oplus$. By combining our results with those of other studies we concluded, in agreement with previous findings, that the detection rate of CO gas is significantly higher for disks around stars with $6.5~L_\\odot<L_*<21.9~L_\\odot$ ($\\sim$A8$-$A0 spectral type) than for disks around less luminous stars ($0.18~L_\\odot<L_*<6.4~L_\\odot$, K7$-$A9). A comparison of the measured CO masses and the estimated mass loss rates of solids in disks with low CO content ($<$10$^{-4}$ M$_\\oplus$) suggests that collisions may play a role in CO gas production in such systems. Interestingly, however, the estimated mass loss rates of CO-rich debris disks are not higher than those of systems with low CO content. In light of this finding, we speculate on what could lead to the formation of CO-rich debris disks.",

CRIMP would uncover the impact of magnetosheath mesoscale drivers, dayside magnetopause mesoscale phenomenological processes and structures, and localized plasma outflows on magnetic reconnection and the energy transfer process in the dayside magnetosphere. CRIMP accomplishes this through uniquely phased spacecraft configurations that allow multipoint, contemporaneous measurements at the magnetopause. This enables an unparalleled look at mesoscale spatial differences along the dayside magnetopause on the scale of 1-3 Earth Radii (Re). Through these measurements, CRMIP will uncover how local mass density enhancements affect global reconnection, how mesoscale structures drive magnetopause dynamics, and if the magnetopause acts as a perfectly absorbing boundary for radiation belt electrons. This allows CRIMP to determine the spatial scale, extent, and temporal evolution of energy and mass transfer processes at the magnetopause - crucial measurements to determine how the solar wind energy input in the magnetosphere is transmitted between regions and across scales. This concept was conceived as a part of the 2024 NASA Heliophysics Mission Design School.",

Rickman Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Context: With no conclusive detection to date, the search for exomoons, satellites of planets orbiting other stars, remains a formidable challenge. Detecting these objects, compiling a population-level sample and constraining their occurrence will inform planet and moon formation models and shed light on moon habitability. Aims: Here, we demonstrate the possibility of a moon search based on astrometric time series data, repeated measurements of the position of a given planet relative to its host star. The perturbing influence of an orbiting moon induces a potentially detectable planetary reflex motion. Methods: Based on an analytical description of the astrometric signal amplitude, we place the expected signatures of putative moons around real exoplanets into context with our current and future astrometric measurement precision. Modelling the orbital perturbation as a function of time, we then simulate the detection process to obtain the first astrometric exomoon sensitivity curves. Results: The astrometric technique already allows for the detection and characterisation of favourable moons around giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs. On the basis of 12 epochs obtained with VLTI/GRAVITY, it is already today possible to infer the presence of a 0.14 $\\mathrm{M}_\\mathrm{Jup}$ satellite at a separation of 0.39 AU around AF Lep b. Future facilities offering better precision will refine our sensitivity in both moon mass and separation from the host planet by several orders of magnitude. Conclusions: The astrometric method of exomoon detection provides a promising avenue towards making the detection of these elusive worlds a reality and efficiently building a sample of confirmed objects. With a future facility that achieves an astrometric precision of 1 mas, probing for Earth-like moons within the habitable zone of a given star will become a realistic proposition.",

In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that the Australian-built Veloce spectrograph on the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope can resolve atmospheric signatures from transiting exoplanets. We observed a single transit of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-189b - a favourable target given its extreme irradiation and bright host star - and applied the cross-correlation technique using standardised templates. We robustly detect ionised calcium (Ca+), and find evidence for hydrogen (H), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), neutral calcium (Ca), titanium (Ti), ionised titanium (Ti+), ionised iron (Fe+), neutral iron (Fe), and ionised strontium (Sr+). The strongest detection was achieved in the red arm of Veloce, consistent with expectations due to the prominent Ca+ triplet at wavelengths around 850-870 nm. Our results validate Veloce's capability for high-resolution atmospheric studies, highlighting it as an accessible, flexible facility to complement larger international telescopes. If future observations stack multiple transits, Veloce has the potential to reveal atmospheric variability, phase-dependent spectral changes, and detailed chemical compositions of highly irradiated exoplanets.",

These features enable a self-consistent estimation of both wavelength-independent and wavelength-dependent parameters. They offer a more robust workflow compared to the commonly used two-step approach, where a \"white\" light curve is fitted first and the transmission spectrum is then derived from independent fits constrained by the white-light solution. Despite its increased flexibility and robustness, ExoIris remains computationally efficient.

We present how measurements of radio pulses from extensive air showers with the Auger Engineering Radio Array, combined with per-event simulations of radio emission using the CoREAS extension of CORSIKA, allow us to determine the energy scale of cosmic rays between $3\\cdot 10^{17}$\\,eV and several $10^{18}$\\,eV. Our analysis accounts for many factors, each of which is controlled on the 5\\% level or better. The absolute calibration of the antennas and the entire analog signal chain builds on a Galactic calibration in combination with a detailed understanding of the antenna-gain patterns. Additional key elements include compensation for temperature-dependent signal amplification, continuous detector health monitoring, an active veto for thunderstorm conditions, an unbiased event reconstruction, and per-event atmospheric modeling in the simulations. The analysis benefits from a high-statistics dataset of over 800 measured cosmic ray showers. We describe our analysis method, perform multiple cross-checks, and evaluate systematic uncertainties. We find that absolute energies determined with AERA are 12\\% higher than those established with the Auger Fluorescence Detector, a result well in agreement within systematic uncertainties and thus a strong independent confirmation of the absolute energy scale of the Pierre Auger Observatory.",

Yet whether open access to these infrastructures translates into more equitable scientific authority remains contested. Astronomy provides a critical case: world-leading observatories are globally shared but embedded in specific national contexts. We compile a novel country--year dataset (1955--2025) linking the location of astronomical facilities with publication usage and authorship roles. This enables us to distinguish between hosting, using, and leading in telescope-based research. Our analysis reveals: (i) usage and impact are heavily concentrated in a small number of facility hubs; (ii) scientific leadership is even more unequal than access or usage (Gini coefficient 0.91 for first/corresponding authorship versus 0.85 for facilities and usage); (iii) hosting and leadership often decouple--countries such as Chile and South Africa mediate large publication volumes without commensurate gains in leading roles; and (iv) global leadership has shifted from U.S. dominance to a multi-hub system centered in the United States, Western Europe, China, Japan, and Australia. These findings challenge the assumption that international access alone democratizes science. We argue that converting participation into leadership requires domestic PI programs, investments in instrumentation and data pipelines, and governance models that distribute credit more equitably. The study highlights how the governance of LSRIs shapes global scientific hierarchies and offers design principles for infrastructures that seek not only to share data but also to broaden scientific authority.",

Accepted in AJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Young planets with mass measurements are particularly valuable in studying atmospheric mass-loss processes, but these planets are rare and their masses difficult to measure due to stellar activity. We report the discovery of a planetary system around TOI-6109, a young, 75 Myr-old Sun-like star in the Alpha Persei cluster. It hosts at least two transiting Neptune-like planets. Using three TESS sectors, 30 CHEOPS orbits, and photometric follow-up observations from the ground, we confirm the signals of the two planets. TOI-6109 b has an orbital period of P=$5.6904^{+0.0004}_{-0.0004}$ days and a radius of R=$4.87^{+0.16}_{-0.12}$ R$_\\oplus$. The outer planet, TOI-6109 c has an orbital period of P=$8.5388^{+0.0006}_{-0.0005}$ days and a radius of R=$4.83^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$ R$_\\oplus$. These planets orbit just outside a 3:2 mean motion resonance. The near-resonant configuration presents the opportunity to measure the planet's mass via TTV measurements and to bypass difficult RV measurements. Measuring the masses of the planets in this system will allow us to test theoretical models of atmospheric mass loss.",

This study explores the evolution of scattered-light features and their relationship with millimeter continuum emission. Archival visible-to-near-infrared scattered-light observations from NACO, SPHERE, and GPI combined with new observations from SCExAO reveal persistent non-axisymmetric structures in both the inner and outer rings of the disk. Through Keplerian image transformations and phase cross-correlation techniques, we show that the azimuthal brightness variations in the inner ring follow the local Keplerian velocity, suggesting these are intrinsic disk features rather than planet-induced spirals or shadows. The motion of the outer ring is weakly detected, requiring a longer observational baseline for further confirmation. Comparing scattered-light features with ALMA 1.3 mm-continuum data, we find that the scattered light traces the edges of dust structures in the inner ring, indicating complex interactions and a leaky dust trap around the water-ice snowline. These findings highlight the capability of long-term monitoring of circumstellar disks to distinguish planetary influences from Keplerian disk dynamics.",

Ziegler 19 pages, 16 figures, accepted in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Only a handful of transiting giant exoplanets with orbital periods longer than 100 days are known. These warm exoplanets are valuable objects as their radius and mass can be measured leading to an in-depth characterisation of the planet's properties. Thanks to low levels of stellar irradiation and large orbital distances, the atmospheric properties and orbital parameters of warm exoplanets remain relatively unaltered by their host star, giving new insights into planetary formation and evolution. We aim at extending the sample of warm giant exoplanets with precise radii and masses. Our goal is to identify suitable candidates in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data and perform follow-up observations with ground-based instruments. We use the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) to detect additional transits of planetary candidates in order to pinpoint their orbital period. We also monitored the target with several high-resolution spectrographs to measure the planetary mass and eccentricity. We report the discovery of a 106-day period Jupiter-sized planet around the G-type star TOI-2449 / NGTS-36. We jointly modelled the photometric and radial velocity data and find that the planet has a mass of 0.70 Mj and a radius of 1.002 Rj. The planetary orbit has a semi-major axis of 0.449 au and is slightly eccentric. We detect an additional 3-year signal in the radial velocity data likely due to the stellar magnetic cycle. Based on the planetary evolution models considered here, we find that TOI-2449 b / NGTS-36 b contains 11 Me of heavy elements and has a marginal planet-to-star metal enrichment of 3.3. Assuming a Jupiter-like Bond albedo, TOI-2449 b / NGTS-36 b has an equilibrium temperature of 400 K and is a good target for understanding nitrogen chemistry in cooler atmospheres.",

We present self-consistent thermochemical disk models built with DiskMINT, which extends its initial framework to allow for spatially decoupled gas and dust distributions. DiskMINT calculates the gas temperature based on thermal equilibrium with dust grains, solves vertical gas hydrostatic equilibrium, and includes key processes for the CO chemistry, specifically selective photodissociation, and freeze-out with conversion CO/CO$_2$ ice. We apply DiskMINT to study the IM Lup disk, a large massive disk, yet with an inferred CO depletion of up to 100 based on earlier thermochemical models. By fitting the multi-wavelength SED along with the millimeter continuum, ${\\rm C^{18}O}$ radial emission profiles, we find $0.02-0.08\\,{\\rm M_\\odot}$ for the gas disk mass, which are consistent with the dynamical-based mass within the uncertainties. We further compare the derived surface densities for dust and gas and find that the outer disk is drift-dominated, with a dust-to-gas mass ratio of approximately 0.01-0.02, which is likely insufficient to meet the conditions for the streaming instability to occur. Our results suggest that when interpreted with self-consistent thermochemical models, ${\\rm C^{18}O}$ alone can serve as a reliable tracer of both the total gas mass and its radial distribution. This approach enables gas mass estimates in lower-mass disks, where dynamical constraints are not available, and in fainter systems where rare species like ${\\rm N_2H^+}$ are too weak to detect.",

Mulders 14 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Migration of giant planets remains a complex topic. While significant progress has been made for high-viscosity disks, the migration of planets with large planet-star mass ratios in low-viscosity environments is still not fully understood. We study the migration of such planets in disks with $\\alpha = 10^{-4}$ and derive analytical prescriptions applicable across stellar masses, from Sun-like stars to M dwarfs. Using hydrodynamical simulations with FARGO3D, we explored planets with mass ratios $10^{-3} < q < 2 \\times 10^{-2}$ under different disk conditions, varying gas surface density, scale height, and density slope. Our results show a migration reversal at $ q \\approx 0.002$, with outward migration for $ q > 0.002$. For planets undergoing outward migration, the migration speed depends on the unperturbed local gas density. In most cases, outward migration is sustained by a positive torque related to planetary eccentricities below $ e < 0.2$. However, for certain disk parameters, planets with $ q > 0.01$ reach higher eccentricities ($0.2 < e < 0.45$), leading to stalled migration. Our findings suggest that outward migration is a viable mechanism for massive planets in low-viscosity disks, which has implications for the formation and distribution of super-Jupiter planets around Sun-like stars and planets more massive than Neptune around very low-mass stars. Given the challenges in detecting such planets, improving our theoretical understanding of their migration is essential for interpreting exoplanet demographics and guiding future observational efforts.",

High internal temperatures from giant impacts can provide sufficient energy to drive extreme volatile loss, with hydrogen being most readily lost. However, the conditions required for maintaining a primordial atmosphere over geological timescales remain enigmatic. This paper revisits the core powered mass loss model for hydrogen removal from planetary atmospheres. One popular approach is to combine mass continuity at the sonic point with an energy-based constraint. We demonstrate that the so-called ``energy limited'' component of this model is unnecessary because atmospheric loss following giant impacts is governed solely by conditions at the sonic point. By simulating a broad range of synthetic exoplanets, varying in planetary mass, atmospheric mass fraction, and temperature, we find that the ``energy limited'' model can underestimate the mass loss rates by up to eight orders of magnitude. Our findings suggest that, for sufficiently hot post-impact surface conditions, hydrogen rich atmospheres can be removed on dynamical timescales that are far shorter than one million years.",

We detect water vapor (ln B = 4.1), carbon dioxide (ln B = 85.6), and sulfur dioxide (ln B = 13.5) with high confidence, along with marginal indications for hydrogen sulfide and carbon monoxide (ln B < 0.5). The detection of SO2 in a warm super-Neptune sized exoplanet (radius about 6 Earth radii) bridges the gap between previous detections in hot Jupiters and sub-Neptunes, highlighting the role of disequilibrium photochemistry across a broad range of exoplanet atmospheres, including those cooler than 1000 K. Our precise measurements of carbon, oxygen, and sulfur indicate an atmospheric metallicity of about 10 times solar and a sub-solar C/O ratio. Retrieved molecular abundances are consistent within 2 sigma with predictions from self-consistent models including photochemistry. The elevated CO2 abundance and possible H2S signal may also reflect sensitivities to the thermal structure, cloud properties, or additional disequilibrium processes such as vertical mixing. We compare the SO2 abundance in HAT-P-26 b with that of ten other JWST-observed giant exoplanets, and find a correlation with atmospheric metallicity. The trend is consistent with the prediction from Crossfield (2023), showing a steep rise in SO2 abundance at low metallicities, and a more gradual increase beyond 30 times solar. This work is part of a series of studies by our JWST Telescope Scientist Team (JWST-TST), in which we use Guaranteed Time Observations to perform Deep Reconnaissance of Exoplanet Atmospheres through Multi-instrument Spectroscopy (DREAMS).",

      "abstract": "Partially Molten Plumes and Melt-Fingers: Two Modes of Magma-Transport through the Mantle in Terrestrial Bodies Ken'yo U, Masanori Kameyama, Takehiro Miyagoshi, Takatoshi Yanagisawa, Masaki Ogawa Geophysics (physics.geo-ph); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn) To understand the dynamics of partially molten mantle in terrestrial bodies, we carried out a linear perturbation analysis and 2-D numerical simulations of magma-matrix flow in a horizontal layer, where decompression melting generates magma that percolates through the convecting matrix. Our study shows that there are two regimes for the upward migration of magma, depending on the melt-buoyancy parameter B_m, which is the ratio of the Stokes velocity of matrix to the percolation velocity of melt, both driven by the melt-buoyancy. At large B_m, the magmatism-mantle upwelling (MMUb) feedback dominates the convective flow in the layer: decompression melting during upwelling enhances magma buoyancy, which further strengthens the upwelling. When a solid layer is overlaid on the partially molten layer, the MMUb feedback induces partially molten plumes that ascend through the solid layer by their melt-buoyancy. At lower B_m, in contrast, a perturbation in the melt-content in the partially molten layer propagates upward as a porosity wave: the perturbation induces a spatial variation in the rate of expansion or contraction of matrix caused by magma migration, leading to an upward shift of the perturbation. When a solid layer is overlaid, the porosity wave develops also along the layer boundary to induce a finger-like magma structure, or melt-finger, that extends upward into the solid layer. The threshold value of B_m for MMUb feedback suggests that it can explain volcanism forming Large Igneous Provinces, but not hotspot volcanism on Earth. Since B_m increases with decreasing matrix viscosity, volcanism caused by the MMUb feedback is likely to have been more important in earlier terrestrial planets where the mantle was hotter and softer. Melt-fingers are, in contrast, expected to have developed in the lunar mantle if a partially molten layer has developed at its base in the history of the Moon.",
