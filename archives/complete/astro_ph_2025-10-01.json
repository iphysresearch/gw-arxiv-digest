Colin Hill Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Inflation generates correlated temperature ($T$) and polarization ($E$-mode) fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which differ only by their transfer functions. Following Philcox et al. (2025), we investigate a scenario with a massive partner to the inflaton ($\\mathcal{O}(100)$ times the inflationary Hubble scale), in which particles are produced during a narrow time period, leaving characteristic hot- or cold-spots in the CMB. Using tools developed for thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich cluster-finding, we search component-separated $\\textit{Planck}$ PR4 $E$-mode maps for these hotspots, and compare to analogous results in $T$. Our analysis pipeline is validated on simulated observations and gives unbiased constraints for sufficiently large and bright hotspots. We find no strong evidence for primordial hotspots and thereby place novel bounds on the marginal and relevant coupling between the inflaton and massive scalars during inflation, probing physics at energies many orders of magnitude above any feasible terrestrial collider. Due to the large noise in $\\textit{Planck}$ polarization, the temperature data dominate constraints for small hotspots, but for sufficiently large hotspots, our bounds improve on those of Philcox et al. (2025) by $\\sim 25\\%$. We also forecast the inferred bounds on inflationary physics for a search using Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data, and from an optimistic cosmic-variance-limited experiment (CV), for which $E$-mode data provide stronger constraints than $T$ on nearly all scales. ACT should improve on the $\\textit{Planck}$ constraints by $\\gtrsim25\\%$, nearing the CV limit on intermediate scales. Finally, we compare the constraining power of localized searches to that of a power spectrum analysis, and demonstrate that for sufficiently few produced particles the localized search performed herein is dominant.",

In particular, this nonlinearity may concern the unknown equation of state of dark energy $w(a)$, defined in the general $w(a)$CDM framework. Nevertheless, a common approach is the linearized approximation hereto notably $w_0w_a$CDM, also applied by DESI. Here, we consider a potential source of a systematic uncertainty in this linearization due to non-commutativity between $w_0w_a$CDM and {\\it a posteriori} linearization of $w(a)$CDM, identified with a symmetry in the latter, which is violated in the former. We shall refer to these as early and late linearization, respectively. We demonstrate this in the analysis of the Hubble expansion in the Local Distance Ladder (LDL). Strikingly, opposite results are found for the evolution of dark energy by early versus late linearization, indicating a thawing or respectively, increasing dark energy. It is unlikely that the DESI pipeline is immune to the same contradiction. Our results show rather than thawing, claimed by DESI, dark energy may in fact be increasing. Further confirmation is expected from {\\it Euclid}.",

CHRONOS combines a ring-cavity Sagnac interferometer with torsion-bar test masses to realize the first quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of angular momentum in a macroscopic system. By implementing a speed-meter readout in the rotational degree of freedom, CHRONOS coherently cancels quantum radiation-pressure noise and enables sub-Hz observations. We show that detuned power recycling and cavity-length optimization can simultaneously relax technical requirements on both torsion bars and speed meters. Assuming a realistic optical design with a 1m torsion bar, we estimate strain sensitivities of $h \\simeq 1 \\times 10^{-18}\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1Hz for detectors with arm lengths of 2.5m, 40m, and 300m. These sensitivities enable (i) direct detection of intermediate-mass black hole binaries up to 380Mpc with ${\\rm SNR}=3$, (ii) probing stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds down to $\\Omega_{\\rm GW} \\sim 3.2 \\times 10^{-9}$ at 0.2Hz with 5yr accumulation. Furthermore, CHRONOS enables prompt detection of gravity-gradient signals from magnitude-5.5 earthquakes even with a 2.5m prototype. CHRONOS thus opens new opportunities for quantum-limited geophysical observation and multi-band, multi-messenger gravitational-wave astronomy.",

To robustly probe such a possibility, we analyze binary black hole mergers in the GWTC-4 with a flexible mixture population model for component masses, spin magnitudes, and spin tilt angles, and identify two distinct subpopulations. In the second subpopulation characterized by high spin magnitudes $\\chi\\sim 0.8$ as well as the broad mass distribution up to $\\gtrsim 150M_\\odot$, we find a pronounced preference for spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum: an isotropic tilt distribution is strongly disfavored (logarithmic Bayes factor = 4.5). The aligned events account for $\\sim 0.57^{+0.23}_{-0.31}$ of the second subpopulation, corresponding to a local rate of $\\sim 0.25^{+0.38}_{-0.16} ~ {\\rm Gpc}^{-3} {\\rm yr}^{-1}$ (all values reflect central 90\\% credible intervals). These notable features naturally arise from hierarchical mergers embedded in AGN disks, where gas torques can effectively align spins.

Shapiro Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We explore the renormalization group-based extension of the $\\Lambda$CDM model as a potential solution to the current cosmological tensions. In this approach, both the cosmological constant density and Newton's constant are allowed to vary with the energy scale, as a consequence of the remnant effects of massive quantum fields in the low-energy regime. The corresponding cosmological model is consistent with the principles of quantum field theory, based on the covariance of the vacuum effective action, and is characterized by an unique extra parameter $\\nu$. Our analysis yields a best-fit value of $\\nu = - (2.5 \\pm 1.3)\\times 10^{-4}$, placing the $\\Lambda$CDM limit at the $2\\sigma$ region of the $\\nu$ posterior. This narrow range is consistent with data from CMB (Planck), BAO (DESI), and SN Ia (DES Y5). Our result also alleviates the $H_0$ tension and is consistent with the previously established constraints from large-scale structure. In this kind of models there is a link between cosmology and particle physics. Our results point to possibility of a new physics, characterized by a mass spectrum lying below the Planck scale but above the values typically associated with Grand Unified Theories (GUTs).",

Our machine learning framework generates uncertainty estimates for target variables and the inferred unknown parameters of the underlying PDE descriptions. Built upon a hybrid of the principles of Evidential Deep Learning, Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Bayesian Neural Networks and Gaussian Processes, our model enables learning of the posterior distribution of the unknown PDE parameters through standard gradient-descent based training. We apply our model to an up-to-date BAO dataset (Bousis et al. 2024) calibrated with the CMB-inferred sound horizon, and the Pantheon$+$ Sne Ia distances (Scolnic et al. 2018), examining the relative effectiveness and mutual consistency among the standard $\\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM and $\\Lambda_s$CDM models. Unlike previous results arising from the standard approach of minimizing an appropriate $\\chi^2$ function, the posterior distributions for parameters in various models trained purely on Pantheon$+$ data were found to be largely contained within the $2\\sigma$ contours of their counterparts trained on BAO data.

It features a symbolic-numeric interface for specifying equations, is free of approximation switching schemes and is compatible with automatic differentiation. Cosmological models are built from replaceable physical components in a way that scales well in model space. The modeler should simply write down their equations, and SymBoltz solves them and eliminates much of the friction in the process. SymBoltz enables up to 100x shorter model definitions compared to browsing equivalent files in CLASS. Symbolic knowledge enables powerful automation of tasks, such as separating computational stages like the background and perturbations, generating the Jacobian matrix and its sparsity pattern, and interpolating arbitrary expressions from the solution. Modern implicit solvers integrate the full stiff equations at all times, reducing slowdowns by taking long time steps, reusing the Jacobian and LU-factorizing it over several time steps, and using fast linear system solvers. Automatic differentiation gives exact derivatives of any output with respect to any input, which is important for gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in large parameter spaces, training of emulators, Fisher forecasting and sensitivity analysis. These features are useful in their own rights, but also reinforce each other in a synergy. Results agree with established codes like CLASS and CAMB. With more work, SymBoltz can grow into an integrated symbolic-numeric cosmological modeling environment with a large library of models that delivers differentiable output as fast as other codes. SymBoltz is available at this https URL with single-command installation and extensive documentation, and welcomes questions, suggestions and contributions.",

Nested sampling, a Bayesian inference technique, has become an established standard for this in the field. However, most common implementations lack the ability to fully utilize modern hardware acceleration. In this work, we demonstrate that when nested sampling is reformulated in a natively vectorized form and run on modern GPU hardware, we can perform inference in a fraction of the time of legacy nested sampling implementations whilst preserving the accuracy and robustness of the method.

In a companion paper arXiv:2508.00798, we previously leveraged the gradient expansion formalism (GEF) to investigate pure axion inflation (PAI), i.e., axion inflaton coupled to a pure gauge sector. In this paper, we extend our analysis to fermionic axion inflation (FAI), i.e., we allow for the presence of fermions in the gauge sector. PAI predicts a strongly blue-tilted GW spectrum; in our GEF benchmark study, all parameter regions leading to observable GWs turned out to violate the upper limit on the number of extra relativistic degrees of freedom, $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$. As we demonstrate in this paper, the situation is different for FAI: Schwinger pair creation of the charged fermions results in a damping of the gauge-field production, which attenuates the GW signal. As a result, the GW signal from FAI can fall into the sensitivity reach of LISA and ET without violating the upper limit on $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$. This result notably applies to the arguably most realistic variant of Abelian axion inflation, in which the axion couples to the hypercharge sector of the Standard Model. Besides, we discuss GW emission from the fermion gas, which may further enhance the total GW signal but which also requires a more quantitative investigation in future work. Additionally, we identify a new backreaction regime in which fermion production moderates the axion--vector dynamics. In this regime, the axion velocity and all energy-density components exhibit oscillations analogous to the strong backreaction in PAI, but here, the oscillations occur around the slow-roll trajectory and are damped by the presence of charged fermions. These observations define again an interesting GEF benchmark for future lattice studies.",

In this work, we investigate the formation of PBHs around the time of the QCD phase transition from a broadly peaked inflationary scalar power spectrum, which naturally produces an extended PBH mass function. This scenario yields two distinct stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB): (i) scalar-induced, second-order tensor perturbations generated at PBH formation, and (ii) a merger-driven SGWB from the subsequent PBH binary population. Using Bayesian analysis, we examine both SGWB channels with the data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the first three observing runs of LVK. We also forecast continuous-wave signals from mini extreme mass ratio inspirals (mini-EMRIs) for direct comparison with NANOGrav and LVK constraints. Our parameter scans identify regions of the parameter space where the combined SGWB is detectable in future ground-based and space-based detectors. A broad PBH mass distribution naturally gives rise to mini-EMRIs, which future ground-based observatories, such as LVK A+, ET, and CE, can detect. For a large part of the PBH parameter space, the SGWB of astrophysical origin masks the primordial SGWB in the frequency band of ground-based detectors. Thus, for extended PBH mass distributions, we find that the detection of mini-EMRIs is a more robust channel for probing the PBH parameter space than the corresponding SGWB.",

All models are implemented in a modified version of \\texttt{Hi\\_CLASS} and confronted with data from \\textit{Planck} 2018, DESI DR1, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The scenarios reproduce the full sequence of cosmic epochs: an early radiation-like phase, a matter-dominated era, and late-time accelerated expansion. The new models predict slightly higher values of the Hubble constant compared to $\\Lambda$CDM, thereby partially alleviating the respective tensions from $\\sim 4.4 \\sigma$ to $\\sim 3.4 \\sigma$. The quadratic potential requires an ultralight mass that makes it effectively indistinguishable from the Scherrer solution.

Here, we reevaluate those original results, but in the context of warm inflation, in which a substantial radiation component (produced by the inflaton) exists throughout the inflationary period. We demonstrate that the same general requirements found in the context of ordinary (cold) inflation also hold true in warm inflation; indeed an even tinier amount of negative running is sufficient to prevent eternal inflation. This is particularly pertinent, as models featuring negative running are more generic in warm inflation scenarios. Finally, the condition for the existence of eternal inflation in cold inflation -- that the curvature perturbation amplitude exceed unity on superhorizon scales -- becomes more restrictive in the case of warm inflation. The curvature perturbations must be even larger, i.e. even farther out on the potential, away from the part of the potential where observables, e.g. in the Cosmic Microwave Background, are produced.",

China Phys. Mech. Astron. (SCPMA) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has opened a new window to test the fundamental nature of gravity. We present constraints on the nonstandard propagation of GWs using the spectral siren method applied to binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). The spectral siren method exploits the redshift distribution of BBHs to probe the cosmic expansion history and break degeneracies between cosmology and modified gravity effects. We focus on the friction term $\\nu$ in the nonstandard GW propagation equation, which characterizes the running of the Planck mass. Assuming the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we find $\\nu = 0.5^{+3.5}_{-2.6}$ (median and $90\\%$ credible interval), improving upon previous constraints from the bright siren event GW170817 by an order of magnitude. This improvement is due to the higher redshifts of BBHs in GWTC-3, reaching up to $z \\sim 1$. Our result suggests that the propagation of GWs is consistent with the predictions of general relativity, placing limits on modified gravity theories that predict a time-varying Planck mass. As the sensitivity of GW detectors improves, the spectral siren method will provide a powerful tool for testing gravity on cosmological scales and probing the physics of the early Universe.",

By incorporating temperature-dependent corrections to the cosmological constant, we extend the standard cosmological model to include additional density parameters, $\\Omega_{Ł_2}$ and $\\Omega_{Ł_3}$, which arise from finite-T quantum gravitational effects. Using the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS), we analyze the impact of these corrections on the cosmic microwave background power spectrum and compare the results with the Planck 2018 data. Through brute-force parameter scans and advanced machine learning techniques, including quartic regression, we demonstrate that the inclusion of $\\Omega_{Ł_2}$ and $\\Omega_{Ł_3}$ improves the model's predictive accuracy, achieving high $R^2$ values and low mean squared error.

Hao Wang, Ze-Yu Peng, Yun-Song Piao Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) In the report by BICEP/Keck collaborations, the tensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.05}<0.036$ (95\\% C.L.). However, recent datasets have preferred the evolving dark energy, which thus have significantly shifted the bestfit values of standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters. In this paper, we perform the joint analysis of BICEP/Keck cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode data, latest DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations and supernova data, combined with Planck PR3 and PR4 CMB data respectively, and find $r_{0.05}=0.0159^{+0.0057}_{-0.014}$ and $r_{0.05}=0.0164^{+0.0063}_{-0.014}$. The constraints on $r$ are further tightened compared to the result of BICEP/Keck collaborations. Though there might be still systematic uncertainties in B-mode measurements due to the foreground contamination, our work is to not say what the value of $r$ is, but present the state-of-the-art constraints on $r$ and emphasize that the detection for $r$ depends potentially on our insight into the dark universe, highlighting the important role of cosmological surveys in comprehending our very early universe.",

However, there are scenarios where these powerful explosions may not have any observable electromagnetic signal, but would still have strong detectable emission in gravitational waves and neutrinos. A regular CCSN explosion may be obscured by matter in the Galaxy. A star may undergo a failed CCSN explosion, where the stalled shockwave is not revived, and would eventually form a black hole. Higher mass progenitor stars may revive the shock, but form a black hole too quickly for the shockwave to reach the surface of the star and produce an electromagnetic signal. Previous work has shown that we can determine if a black hole forms from the CCSN neutrino emission if there are long duration sinusoidal modulations in the neutrino signal caused by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI). The SASI also produces an observable signature in the gravitational-wave emission. In this paper, we investigate if we can distinguish between different scenarios for electromagnetically dark CCSNe using the gravitational-wave emission alone. We find, using a reconstruction of the SASI mode, abrupt end times of the gravitational-wave emission, and the rate of change of frequency of the dominant mode, that we are able to accurately distinguish between an obscured CCSN, a failed CCSN, and an explosion with fast black hole formation.",

We investigate how a different initial magnetic field configuration, nuclear equation of state, or binary mass ratio affects the magnetic and thermodynamic evolution of the post-merger remnant and disk. We also analyze the impact of the commonly-assumed reflection (bitant) symmetry across the equatorial plane. Magnetic field amplification occurs shortly after the merger due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability; later, the field keeps evolving with a predominantly toroidal configuration due to winding and turbulence. The initial magnetic field topology leaves an imprint on the field structure and affects magnetic field amplification for the initial magnetic field values commonly assumed in the literature and the limited resolution of the simulations. Enforcing equatorial reflection symmetry partially suppresses the development of turbulence near the equatorial plane and impacts the post-merger magnetic field evolution. Stiffer EOSs produce larger, less compact remnants that may retain memory of the pre-merger strong poloidal field.",

Richardson Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) A major barrier to improving the quantum-limited sensitivity of gravitational-wave observatories is the thermal distortions of the test masses which arise at megawatt laser power. Recent advances in a new form of higher-order wavefront correction, in which corrective heating profiles are applied to the test mass surfaces near their edges, together with other planned instrumental upgrades, have the potential to enable a tenfold reduction of the quantum noise floor of future detectors. However, realizing high levels of quantum noise reduction in practice hinges on identifying measurable error signals to finely control each wavefront actuator, in order to suppress wavefront errors to a few-nanometer precision across the full mirror apertures. No direct source of such an error signal exists in LIGO today. We demonstrate that thermally imaging the surface of each test mass can provide these critical error signals. We show that the surface temperature profiles obtained from thermal imaging can be uniquely mapped to a finite element model of the mirror whose complete thermal state is identified, enabling full-aperture wavefront reconstruction and direct error signals for real-time precision wavefront control. This new sensing capability can enable up to a 34% strain sensitivity improvement in LIGO A+ at 95% confidence, increasing the sky-averaged detection range for binary neutron star mergers by 11 Mpc, and will be integral to a next-generation 40-km gravitational-wave observatory in the U.S., Cosmic Explorer.",

Traditional matched filtering approaches face computational challenges with diverse signal morphologies and non-stationary noise. This work presents a deep learning methodology integrating Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) preprocessing with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder architecture for gravitational wave detection. The CWT provides optimal time-frequency decomposition capturing chirp evolution and transient characteristics essential for compact binary coalescence identification. We first develop the model using synthetic datasets incorporating binary black hole merger signals with masses ranging from 10 to 80 solar masses. These signals are then embedded in colored Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity. The trained model demonstrates strong performance metrics. We then apply the CWT-LSTM model to gravitational wave data from multiple LIGO observing runs. We use 418 clean noise samples for training the anomaly detection model, while the test dataset contained a mix of 24 confirmed gravitational wave events and 161 noise samples. The model demonstrates strong performance with an AUC of 0.979 and Average Precision (AP) of 0.932, achieving a precision of 1.0 at the optimal threshold with a recall of 0.83. The reconstruction error distribution shows clear separation between noise and gravitational wave signals, with noise samples clustering around 0.45 and signals around 0.65. This unsupervised approach enables discovery of signals with unknown morphologies that could provide complementary \"blind search\" capability for detecting exotic astrophysical sources and novel physics beyond current theoretical models.",

Unlike the conventional assumption of a perfectly isotropic and homogeneous pre-inflationary Universe, we introduce a small inhomogeneous perturbation, treated within a perturbative framework. Our analysis builds on previously developed empirical models of inhomogeneous primordial power spectrum models based on dipole modulation. Using in-in formalism, we compute two-point correlations directly from the metric and demonstrate that, at leading order, this introduces a direction-dependent power spectrum that breaks rotational symmetry and naturally selects a preferred direction, relating observed violation of the cosmological principle to inflationary power spectra arising from scalar field fluctuations. Additionally, we find that this framework produces correlations between multipoles separated by $\\Delta l=1$, leading to distinctive signatures in the multipole space.

However, computationally demanding as they are, their use is limited to a relatively small number of representative cases. When comparing to the distribution of large samples of objects in the luminosity-distance plane (P-D plane), the most efficient approach is to use analytical or semi-analytical models that reproduce the evolution of the main parameters governing the dynamics and radio luminosity of the sources. Our aim is to build a semi-analytical model that allows us to produce mock samples of radio galaxies to be compared with real populations and use this approach to constrain the general properties of active galaxies with jets in a cosmological context. In this work, we present a new model for the evolution of radio galaxies based on the resolution of ordinary differential equations and inspired both by previous experience on numerical simulations of jets across several orders of magnitude in power, and by observational evidence. Our results show remarkable agreement between the results given by the semi-analytical model and those obtained by both 2D and 3D relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of jets ranging from 1.e35 W to 1.e39 W. From the derived trajectories of powerful radio galaxies through the P-D diagram (powers greater than 1.e36 W), our model agrees with typical lifetimes of galactic activity of < 500 Myr. We also compare our results with previous models in the literature. In a follow-up paper, we use this model to generate mock populations of radio galaxies at low redshifts and compare them to the LoTSS sample.",

This creates a significant bottleneck, particularly for non-standard cosmological models and the high-accuracy demands of future surveys. While emulators based on deep neural networks can accelerate this process by several orders of magnitude, they first require large, pre-computed training datasets, which are costly to generate and model-specific. To address this challenge, we introduce gCAMB, a version of the CAMB code ported to GPUs, which preserves all the features of the original CPU-only code. By offloading the most computationally intensive modules to the GPU, gCAMB significantly accelerates the generation of power spectra, saving massive computational time, halving the power consumption in high-accuracy settings and, among other purposes, facilitating the creation of extensive training sets needed for robust cosmological analyses.

Uhlemann, the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies is one of the key secondary signals to cosmic shear measurements, and must be modeled to interpret weak lensing data and infer the correct cosmology. There are large uncertainties in the physical description of IA, and analytical calculations are often out of reach for weak lensing statistics beyond two-point functions. We present here a set of six flexible IA models infused directly into weak lensing simulations, constructed from the mass shells, the projected tidal fields and, optionally, dark matter halo catalogues. We start with the non-linear linear alignment (NLA) and progressively sophisticate the galaxy bias and the tidal coupling models, including the commonly-used extended NLA (also known as the e-NLA or $\\delta$-NLA) and the tidal torque (TT) models. We validate our methods with MCMC analyses from two-point shear statistics, then compute the impact on non-Gaussian cosmic shear probes from these catalogues as well as from reconstructed convergence maps. We find that the $\\delta$-NLA model has by far the largest impact on most probes, at times more than twice the strength of the NLA. We also observe large differences between the IA models in under-dense regions, which makes minima, void profiles and lensing PDF the best probes for model rejection. Furthermore, our bias models allow us to separately study the source-clustering term for each of these probes, finding good agreement with the existing literature, and extending the results to these new probes. The third-order aperture mass statistics ($M^3_{ap}$) and the integrated three-point functions are particularly sensitive to this when including low-redshift data, often exceeding a 20% impact on the data vector. Our IA models are straightforward to implement and rescale from a single simulated IA-infused galaxy catalogue, allowing for fast model exploration.",

Rykoff Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We investigate a splashback-like feature in the outer region of central galaxies (CGs) in clusters. This feature is detected as a \"dip\" in the radial slope of the CG surface brightness, derived through the stacking of Dark Energy Survey data of over four thousand galaxy clusters in the redshift range of 0.2 to 0.5 with richness 20 and above. The local minimum of the dip occurs between 40 to 60 kpc from the CG center, with a mild dependence on cluster richness. This feature resembles the density transition caused by the splashback effect at the outskirts of galaxy clusters, when accreted matter reaches the apocenter for the first time. We turn to the IllustrisTNG hydro-dynamic simulation to gain theoretical insights. Density bumps, shells and accretion streaks are identified in the diffuse stellar content of the CGs and intra-cluster light which relate to the recent history of disruption and accretion. These features occur at the outskirts of the CGs, up to several hundred kiloparsecs from the cluster center. Thus, the location of the splashback-like dip in the data potentially marks the edge of the CG and the beginning of a region with the cluster diffuse light undergoing active or recent accretion.",

Archival maps from far-infrared and sub-millimeter surveys potentially contain the redshifted [CII]-158$\\mu$m, hidden in the much brighter continuum emission. We present a search for aggregate [CII]-158$\\mu$m line emission across the predicted peak of star formation history by tomographically stacking a high-completeness galaxy catalog on broadband deep maps of the COSMOS field and constraining residual excess emission after subtracting the continuum spectral energy distribution (SED). We obtain constraints on the sky-averaged [CII]-158$\\mu$m signal from the three Herschel/SPIRE maps: $11.8\\pm10.2$, $11.0\\pm8.7$, $9.6\\pm9.8$, and $9.2\\pm6.6$ $k$Jy/sr at redshifts $z\\sim 0.65$, $\\sim1.3$, $\\sim2.1$, and $\\sim2.6$ respectively, corresponding to $1-1.4\\sigma$ significance in each bin. Our $3\\sigma$ upper limits are in tension with past $z\\sim2.6$ results from cross-correlating SDSS-BOSS quasars with high-frequency Planck maps, and indicate a much less dramatic evolution ($\\sim\\times7.5$) of mean [CII] intensity across the peak of star formation history than collisional excitation models or frameworks calibrated to the tentative PlanckxBOSS measurement. We discuss this tension, particularly in the context of in-development surveys (TIM, EXCLAIM) that will map this [CII] at high redshift resolution. Having demonstrated stacking in broadband deep surveys as a complementary methodology to next-generation spectrometers for line intensity mapping, our novel methods can be extended to upcoming galaxy surveys such as Euclid, as well as to place upper limits on fainter atomic and molecular lines.",

Using hydrodynamical simulations, we show that the progenitors' baryonic binding energy, $|E_{\\rm bind}|$, critically controls the outcome. Repeated potential fluctuations, e.g., from bursty feedback, inject energy and reduce $|E_{\\rm bind}|$ by $\\approx 15\\%$, yielding fewer but substantially more massive BDDGs. By contrast, elastic self-interacting dark matter produces comparable cores without lowering $|E_{\\rm bind}|$, resulting in negligible effect. This provides a novel way to distinguish between two leading galactic core formation channels, i.e., the baryon feedback and elastic dark matter self-interaction. Among 15 paired simulation runs, 13 show higher BDDG masses in the weakened-binding case, and about two thirds exhibit $>100\\%$ mass enhancements. The simulations also predict systematically lower gas fractions due to sustained post-collision star formation, yielding a clean observational signature. Upcoming wide-field imaging (CSST, LSST), HI surveys (FAST), and kinematic follow-up will be crucial to test this scenario.",

This flux density-limited sample includes 106 DSFGs in total, along with 14 galaxies from a recent pilot study -- altogether doubling the to-date available high-redshift \\coonezero observations. These sources cover redshifts 1 to 6 with available mid/high-\\textit{J} CO transitions from the Northern Extended Millimeter Array \\zgal survey. We detect \\coonezero emission in 90/92 targets above signal-to-noise ratio of 2, while two DSFGs remain undetected. \\vzgal also covers additional \\cotwoone emission lines in 10 of these sources.

Using \\coonezero luminosities as an anchor, we robustly derive the CO brightness temperature ratios with a good statistical significance up to \\textit{J} = 6. Our measurements reveal a broad range of gas excitation conditions across the \\vzgal DSFGs. We also explore [CI](1$-$0)/CO(1$-$0) ratios in 23 \\vzgal galaxies that have existing detections of atomic carbon ground-state emission, [CI](1$-$0), from the \\zgal survey.

D Phys.Rev.D 112 (2025) 6, 063503 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) As next-generation telescopes and observational surveys continue to expand the boundaries of our understanding, tensions and discrepancies between observational datasets are becoming increasingly prominent. In this work, we focus on one such discrepancy: the differences between 2D and 3D Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements. Without extending beyond the standard $\\Lambda$CDM framework, we systematically study and highlight this discrepancy in different parameter spaces. This work examines the constraints on fundamental cosmological parameters ($H_0$, $r_d$, $\\Omega_m$) derived from Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) and Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) data. By analyzing BAO observational datasets from two distinct methodologies (2D and 3D) alongside the Pantheon Plus SNIa sample, we identify a significant systematic difference: 2D BAO measurements consistently yield higher values of $hr_d$ compared to both 3D BAO and DESI analyses. While 2D BAO measurements appear to bridge the Hubble tension by simultaneously accommodating both a higher $H_0$ value (aligning with SH0ES) and a larger sound horizon $r_d$ (matching Planck), this apparent reconciliation comes at the cost of introducing tension with the well-constrained Planck measurement of $\\Omega_{m0}h^2$. This behavior arises because of systematically higher values of the product $H_0r_d$ observed in 2D BAO analysis compared to 3D analyses. Therefore, given these systematic differences, we advocate for careful consideration when using 2D BAO measurements to address the Hubble tension, suggesting that understanding the origin of this 2D-3D discrepancy should be a priority for future investigations.",

Updated to match the version published in JCAP Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Large near-future galaxy surveys offer sufficient statistical power to make our cosmology analyses data-driven, limited primarily by systematic errors. Understanding the impact of systematics is therefore critical. We perform an end-to-end analysis to investigate the impact of some of the systematics that affect large-scale structure studies by doing an inference analysis using simulated density maps with various systematics; these include systematics caused by photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s), Galactic dust, structure induced by the telescope observing strategy and observing conditions, and incomplete covariance matrices. Specifically, we consider the impacts of incorrect photo-$z$ distributions (photometric biases, scatter, outliers; spectroscopic calibration biases), dust map resolution, incorrect dust law, selecting none or only some contaminant templates for deprojection, and using a diagonal covariance matrix instead of a full one. We quantify the biases induced by these systematics on cosmological parameter estimation using tomographic galaxy angular power spectra, with a focus on identifying whether the maximum plausible level of each systematic has an adverse impact on the estimation of key cosmological parameters from a galaxy clustering analysis with Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We find photo-$z$ systematics to be the most pressing out of the systematics investigated, with spectroscopic calibration biases leading to the greatest adverse impact while helpfully being flagged by a high $\\chi^2$ value for the best fit model. Larger-than-expected photo-$z$ scatter, on the other hand, has a significant impact without necessarily indicating a poor fit. In contrast, in the analysis framework used in this work, biases from observational systematics and incomplete covariance matrices are comfortably subdominant.",

Since neutrinos decoupled from the primordial plasma about one second after the big bang, they have been free-streaming through the universe. This induced a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic peaks as a unique signature. In this work, we constrain the free-streaming nature of these relativistic species and other light relics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics by establishing two complementary template-based approaches to robustly infer the size of this phase shift from the temperature and polarization power spectra. One template shifts the multipoles in these spectra, while the other novel template more fundamentally isolates the phase shift at the level of the underlying photon-baryon perturbations. Applying these methods to Planck data, we detect the neutrino-induced phase shift at about $10\\sigma$ significance, which rises to roughly $14\\sigma$ with additional data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole Telescope. We also infer that the data is consistent with the Standard Model prediction of three free-streaming neutrinos. In addition, we forecast the capabilities of future experiments which will enable significantly more precise phase-shift measurements, with the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 reducing the $1\\sigma$ uncertainties to roughly 4.3% and 2.5%, respectively. More generally, we establish a new analysis pipeline for the phase shift induced by neutrinos and other free-streaming dark radiation which additionally offers new avenues for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model in a signature-driven and model-agnostic way.",

SIDM Concerto includes one Large Magellanic Cloud- (LMC-) mass system (host mass $\\sim 10^{11}~M_{\\mathrm{\\odot}}$), two Milky Way (MW) analogs ($\\sim 10^{12}~M_{\\mathrm{\\odot}}$), two group-mass hosts ($\\sim 10^{13}~M_{\\mathrm{\\odot}}$), and one low-mass cluster ($\\sim 10^{14}~M_{\\mathrm{\\odot}}$). Each host contains $\\approx 2\\times 10^7$ particles and is run in CDM and one or more strong, velocity-dependent SIDM models. Our analysis of SIDM (sub)halo populations over seven subhalo mass decades reveals that (1) the fraction of core-collapsed isolated halos and subhalos peaks at a maximum circular velocity corresponding to the transition of the SIDM cross section from a $v^{-4}$ to $v^0$ scaling; (2) SIDM subhalo mass functions are suppressed by $\\approx 50\\%$ relative to CDM in LMC, MW, and group-mass hosts but are consistent with CDM in the low-mass cluster host; (3) subhalos' inner density profile slopes, which are more diverse in SIDM than in CDM, are sensitive to both the amplitude and shape of the SIDM cross section. Our simulations provide a benchmark for testing SIDM predictions with astrophysical observations of field and satellite galaxies, strong lensing systems, and stellar streams.

Accepted in MNRAS Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Several observational studies suggest that the local few hundred Mpc around the Local Group are significantly underdense based on source number counts in redshift space across much of the electromagnetic spectrum, particularly in near-infrared galaxy counts. This ``Keenan--Barger--Cowie (KBC) void'', ``Local Hole'', or ``local supervoid'', would have significant ramifications for the Hubble tension by generating outflows that masquerade as an enhanced local expansion rate. We evaluate models for the KBC void capable of resolving the Hubble tension with a background Planck cosmology. We fit these models to direct distances from the Tully--Fisher catalogue of the CosmicFlows-4 compilation using a field-level forward model. Depending on the adopted void density profile, we find the derived velocity fields to prefer a void size of less than 70 Mpc, which is less than 10 per cent of the fiducial size found by Haslbauer et al. based on the KBC luminosity density data. The predicted local Hubble constant is $72.1^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$, $70.4^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$, or $70.2^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ km/s/Mpc for an initial underdensity profile that is exponential, Gaussian, or Maxwell-Boltzmann, respectively. The latter two ameliorate the Hubble tension to within $3\\sigma$ of the 4-anchor distance ladder approach of Breuval et al. giving $73.2 \\pm 0.9$ km/s/Mpc. The exponential profile does achieve consistency with this measurement at just over $1\\sigma$, but it is disfavoured by the Bayesian evidence. The preferred models produce bulk flow curves that disagree with recent estimates from CosmicFlows-4, despite the void models being flexible enough to match such estimates.",

By systematically analyzing a large sample of groups, we find a robust perpendicular alignment between group spin and filament orientation. Among all examined properties, only group mass and the distance to the nearest filament significantly affect the strength of this alignment: more massive groups and those closer to filaments exhibit a stronger perpendicular signal. In contrast, the alignment is largely insensitive to group richness, the stellar mass threshold used to select member galaxies, and redshift. We further quantify the bias introduced by using member galaxies as tracers of group spin, finding a typical misalignment angle of $\\sim38^\\circ$ between the spin measured from all dark matter particles and that inferred from member galaxies, independent of group richness or stellar mass cut. Our results provide a clear theoretical benchmark for interpreting observational measurements of spin-filament alignment and highlight the importance of considering group mass and environment.

A standard numerical approach involves injecting magnetic helicity at intermediate length scales to generate a secondary, time-dependent spectral peak that gradually propagates toward larger scales. Previous simulations have already suggested a resistive dependence of inverse transfer rates and demonstrated the significant influence of magnetic helicity flux density $\\epsilon_\\mathrm{H}$ on this process. On dimensional grounds, we have $E_\\mathrm{M}(k,t)=C_\\mathrm{H} \\epsilon_\\mathrm{H}^{2/3} k^{-1}$ where $C_\\mathrm{H}$ represents a potentially universal dimensionless coefficient analogous to the Kolmogorov constant.

CMB Experiments can discover the Origin in Near Future Harsh Mehta, Suvodip Mukherjee 19 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables. To be submitted to ApJL Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The massive and bright galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at high redshifts ($z > 6$) have challenged our understanding of the Universe. This may require revisiting the physics of galaxy formation and evolution, or modifying the $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model to explain these observations, or both. We show that high-resolution CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory (or CMB-S4) can measure smoking-gun signatures jointly in weak lensing and kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) power spectra, which can shed light on both these scenarios. An increase in the matter power spectrum at small scales will enhance the number density of dark matter halos at high redshifts, thereby increasing the galaxy formation rate. This will cause enhanced weak lensing signal from these redshifts and also lead to enhanced patchy-kSZ signal from the epoch of reionization. However, if only galaxy astrophysics is modified, without any modification in the matter power spectrum, then the patchy-kSZ signal gets altered, while the weak lensing signal remains nearly unaltered. We show that we can measure the modified astrophysical and cosmological scenarios at a statistical significance of $6.2\\sigma$ (and $17.4\\sigma$) from Simons Observatory (and CMB-S4), which will enable a conclusive understanding on what physical process is driving the high-redshift observations of JWST.",

Because gravitational tides can accelerate core-collapse, the most promising targets to observe core-collapse are satellite galaxies and subhalo systems. However, simulating small subhalos is computationally intensive, especially when subhalos start to core-collapse. In this work, we present a hierarchical framework for simulating a population of SIDM subhalos, which reduces the computation time to linear order in the total number of subhalos. With this method, we simulate substructure lensing systems with multiple velocity-dependent SIDM models, and show how subhalo evolution depends on the SIDM model, subhalo mass and orbits. We find that an SIDM cross section of $\\gtrsim 200$ cm$^2$/g at velocity scales relevant for subhalos' internal heat transfer is needed for a significant fraction of subhalos to core-collapse in a typical lens system at redshift $z=0.5$, and that core-collapse has unique observable features in lensing. We show quantitatively that core-collapse in subhalos is typically accelerated compared to field halos, except when the SIDM cross section is non-negligible ($\\gtrsim \\mathcal{O}(1)$ cm$^2$/g) at subhalos' orbital velocities, in which case evaporation by the host can delay core-collapse. This suggests that substructure lensing can be used to probe velocity-dependent SIDM models, especially if line-of-sight structures (field halos) can be distinguished from lens-plane subhalos. Intriguingly, we find that core-collapse in subhalos can explain the recently reported ultra-steep density profiles of substructures found by lensing with the \\emph{Hubble Space Telescope}",

When coupled with orbital evolution, this is expected to naturally produce a large diversity in dark-matter halos' inner mass distribution, potentially explaining the diversity problem of dwarf galaxies. However, it remains unknown how the diversity in SIDM dark-matter halos propagates to the more easily observed luminous matter at the center of the halo, especially the stellar component. In this work, we use idealized N-body simulations with two species of particles (dark matter and stars) to study the response of the stellar properties of field and satellite dwarf galaxies to SIDM evolution and orbital effects on their halos. Galaxies' stellar components, including galaxy size, mass-to-light ratio, and stellar velocity dispersion, display a much larger scatter in SIDM than the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model. Importantly, we find signs of universality in the evolution pathways, or \"tidal tracks\", of SIDM dwarf satellites, which are physically interpretable and potentially parameterizable. This type of tidal-track model can be layered onto larger-scale, cosmological simulations to reconstruct the evolution of populations of SIDM dwarfs in cases where high-resolution simulations of galaxies are otherwise prohibitively expensive.",

Comments welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Gravitational waves (GWs) from coalescing binary black holes (BBHs) can come from different environments. GWs interact gravitationally with astrophysical objects, which makes it possible to use gravitational lensing by objects in the same gravitational system (self-lensing) to learn about their environments. We quantify the probability of self-lensing through the optical depth $\\tau$ for the main channels of detectable GWs at frequencies $f_{\\rm GW}\\sim (1-10^3)\\,{\\rm Hz}$. We then analyze the detectability of the lensing effect (imprint). In star clusters, the probability of self-lensing by stellar-mass black holes (BHs) is low, $\\tau\\simeq10^{-7}$, even when taking into account nearby BHs in resonant interactions, $\\tau\\simeq 10^{-5}$. Additionally, the lensing imprint of a stellar-mass lens (diffraction and interference) is too marginal to be detectable by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors and most Einstein Telescope signals. For a massive BH lens in the center of a cluster, the probability can reach $\\tau\\simeq 10^{-4}$ either via von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai induced mergers of BBHs orbiting a central massive BH, or BBHs formed as GW captures in single-single interactions in the Bahcall-Wolf cusp of a nuclear cluster. For self-lensing by a supermassive BH for BBHs in the migration trap of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk, $\\tau \\simeq 10^{-2}$. The imprint of these massive lenses are multiple images that are already detectable. Moreover, self-lensed signals from AGN disks have a distinct linear polarization. The probability depends on the extent of the detectability through the threshold impact parameter $y_{\\rm max}$, which can increase for future detectors. We conclude that constraining the environment of BBHs is possible by combining self-lensing imprints with other waveform signatures such as eccentricity and polarization.",

Submitted to MNRAS Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) To achieve the sensitivity required to detect signals from neutral hydrogen from the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionisation it is critical to have a well-calibrated instrument which has a stable calibration over the course of the observation. Previous calibration methods do not explicitly use the time information available and make assumptions on the impedance matching of the reference sources. Here we present a new calibration method based on noise wave parameters which fits a calibration solution over time and frequency to the data, interpolating the solutions to the times at which the antenna is being measured. To test this method we simulate a dataset using measurements of the REACH receiver, modelling a low noise amplifier which is drifting over time. Fitting a polynomial surface in frequency and time to the simulated data demonstrates that we can remove the drift in the calibrated solution over time but leaves a chromatic residual. We further show that we can remove assumptions on the reflection coefficients of the reference noise source and the cold load, reducing degeneracies in the parameter fits. Applying this new calibration equation and surface fitting method to the simulated data removes the chromatic residual in the calibrated spectrum and recovers the parameters to within 0.06% of the truth and a 97% reduction in the RMSE of the spectrum of the validation source compared with previous calibration methods. For two parameters we report up to six times smaller fit error after the degeneracies are removed from the time-based calibration.",

Through the identification of narrow hydrogen emission lines at a consistent redshift of $z = 1.036 \\pm 0.004$, we calibrate the distance scale, and therefore the energetics, of this unique extragalactic transient.

We find no evidence for ongoing transient emission at the GRB position, and exclude any accompanying supernova with a luminosity comparable to the Type Ic broad-line SN 2023lcr, though we are unable to constrain fainter events. The inferred rate of such events, assuming at most one in the lifetime of {\\em Fermi}, suggests that such bursts are very rare, with volumetric rates $>1,000$ times lower than normal high luminosity long GRBs and $> 10^5$ times lower than core collapse supernovae when corrected for beaming. Furthermore, we find that the host galaxy is unique amongst GRB host galaxies, and extremely rare in the general galaxy population, being extremely large, dusty and with high stellar mass. The identification of such an exotic GRB in such an unusual galaxy raises the possibility that the environment was important in the progenitor channel for this event.",

Perets, Jonathan Granot High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (ULGRBs), a rare class of high-energy transients with durations $>10^3$,s, remain poorly understood. GRB,250702B ($z=1.04$) is notable for its multi-hour prompt emission, an X-ray precursor $\\sim$1 day earlier, off-nuclear host position, and hard, rapidly variable gamma-rays. This combination is difficult to explain with standard ULGRB progenitors such as blue-supergiant collapsars, magnetar engines, or white-dwarf tidal disruptions by intermediate-mass black holes. We interpret the event as a micro-tidal disruption event ($\\mu$TDE), where a stellar-mass black hole or neutron star partially or fully disrupts a main-sequence star. Three $\\mu$TDE pathways can reproduce the observed precursor-main flare delay: (i) a \\emph{dynamical (partial/repeating)} disruption, in which a grazing passage yields a faint precursor and the core returns after $\\sim$day for a deeper encounter; (ii) a \\emph{natal-kick} disruption, where the delay reflects the ballistic motion of a newborn compact object relative to its companion, leading to full disruption; and (iii) a \\emph{hybrid natal-kick + partial} case, in which the kick seeds the close encounter but the first passage is only partial, with the core returning on the day-scale period. Cross-section scalings imply comparable rates for partial and full outcomes in both dynamical and natal-kick scenarios. The highly variable, hard $\\gamma$-ray emission supports association with a stellar-mass compact object. Fallback and viscous accretion naturally explain the ultra-long duration, energetics, and ks-scale X-ray variability. We outline observational discriminants between the three channels and argue that $\\mu$TDEs offer a compelling framework for ULGRBs such as GRB 250702B.",

We collected a rich set of optical and infrared follow-up observations of its rapidly fading afterglow using a suite of telescopes including the W. M. Keck Observatory, the Gemini telescopes, the Magellan Baade Telescope, the Victor M. Blanco 4-meter telescope, and the Fraunhofer Telescope at Wendelstein Observatory. Our analysis reveals that the afterglow emission is well described by forward shock emission from a highly obscured relativistic jet. Deep photometric observations of the host galaxy reveal a massive 10^10.66 solar masses, dusty, and extremely asymmetric system that is consistent with two galaxies undergoing a major merger. The galactocentric offset, host galaxy properties, and jet characteristics do not definitively distinguish between competing progenitor scenarios. We find that the afterglow and host are consistent with a range of progenitors including a collapsar, a merger between a helium star and a stellar mass black hole, the disruption of a star by a stellar mass compact object, and the tidal disruption of a star by an off-nuclear intermediate mass black hole.",

Williams High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) GRB 250702B is an exceptional transient that produced multiple episodes of luminous gamma-ray radiation lasting for $>25$ ks, placing it among the class of ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, unlike any known GRB, a soft X-ray precursor was discovered by the Einstein Probe up to 24 hours before the gamma-ray triggers. We present comprehensive X-ray observations of the transient's afterglow obtained with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, and the Chandra X-ray Observatory between 0.5 to 65 days (observer frame) after the initial high-energy trigger. The X-ray emission decays steeply as $\\sim t^{-1.9}$, and shows short timescale X-ray variability ($\\Delta T/T < 0.03$) in both Swift and NuSTAR, consistent with flares superposed on an external shock continuum. Serendipitous detections by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) out to $\\sim$0.3 days and continued NuSTAR variability to $\\sim$2 days imply sustained central engine activity; including the precursor, the required engine duration is $\\gtrsim 3$ days. Afterglow modeling favors the combination of forward and reverse shock emission in a wind-like ($k \\approx 2$) environment. These properties, especially the long-lived engine and soft X-ray precursor, are difficult to reconcile with a collapsar origin, and GRB 250702B does not fit neatly with canonical ultra-long GRBs or relativistic tidal disruption events (TDEs). A hybrid scenario in which a star is disrupted by a stellar-mass black hole (a micro-TDE) provides a plausible explanation, although a relativistic TDE from an intermediate-mass black hole remains viable. Decisive discrimination between progenitors will require sensitive late-time X-ray observations.",

Trigg, Anastasia Tsvetkova, Mikhail Ulanov, Péter Veres, Maia Williams, Colleen A. Wilson-Hodge, Joshua Wood High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Gamma-ray bursts are the most luminous electromagnetic events in the universe. Their prompt gamma-ray emission has typical durations between a fraction of a second and several minutes. A rare subset of these events have durations in excess of a thousand seconds, referred to as ultra-long gamma-ray bursts. Here, we report the discovery of the longest gamma-ray burst ever seen with a ~25,000 s gamma-ray duration, GRB 250702B, and characterize this event using data from four instruments in the InterPlanetary Network and the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image. We find a hard spectrum, subsecond variability, and high total energy, which are only known to arise from ultrarelativistic jets powered by a rapidly-spinning stellar-mass central engine. These properties and the extreme duration are together incompatible with all confirmed gamma-ray burst progenitors and nearly all models in the literature. This burst is naturally explained with the helium merger model, where a field binary ends when a black hole falls into a stripped star and proceeds to consume and explode it from within. Under this paradigm, GRB 250702B adds to the growing evidence that helium stars expand and that some ultra-long GRBs have similar evolutionary pathways as collapsars, stellar-mass gravitational wave sources, and potentially rare types of supernovae.",

Submitted for publication in ApJ. Comments welcome! High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We perform milliarcsecond X-ray astrometry of the quadruply lensed radio-quiet quasar GraL J065904.1+162909 (J0659). This z = 3.083 quasar is lensed into four images and was discovered with the second Data Release of the Gaia Space Observatory (Gaia DR2). The methodology of using gravitational lenses as high resolution telescopes has been applied, so far, to five lensed quasars (including J0659) and shows potential to elucidate the spatial origin of the X-ray and optical emitting regions in distant quasars. We use Gaia DR3 and HST observations of J0659 and infer a mass model for the deflector that reproduces the positions of the quasar lensed images to milliarcsecond precision. Next, we apply archival Chandra observations of J0659, together with our lens model, to conduct a Bayesian test evaluating whether the X-ray emitting region coincides with the optical source position predicted by our mass model. We constrain the origin of the X-ray emission to be within a 0.''030 x 0.''020 ellipse at the 99.7% level, finding the maximum possible distance between the X-ray and optical source is 44.7 milliarcseconds. Our methodology enhances Chandra's spatial resolution at high-z by a factor of 6. We provide a novel approach that extends the methodology towards investigating the origin of the soft and hard X-ray emitting regions in lensed quasars. We elaborate on the potential of upcoming broadband and spectrally resolved X-ray astrometric studies to probe complex quasar morphology at high-z and to identify dual and binary AGN candidates.",

We employ an ensemble of single-crossed angular distributions and explore the physics of flavor conversion, while neutrinos propagate across a one-dimensional inhomogeneous medium. The advective term in the neutrino equations of motion is responsible for the cascade of flavor waves towards ever smaller spatial and angular scales. However, as the system evolves, perturbations with large wavenumbers are damped, with a resulting smearing of the flavor configuration. We provide a simple recipe that allows to forecast the steady-state flavor configuration achieved by neutrinos without solving their kinetic equations. In particular, we find that flavor equipartition on one side of the angular spectrum and the cancellation of the spectral crossing in the lepton number distributions, proposed in the literature as generic flavor outcome, is a special solution depending on the degree of neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry. This work constitutes a step forward towards the development of semi-analytic schemes to account for flavor conversion physics in hydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star merger remnants.",

Submitted to MNRAS Letters, comments welcome! High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) GRB 250702B is a unique astrophysical transient characterised by its nature as a repeating gamma-ray trigger. Its properties include possible periodicity in its gamma-ray light curve, an X-ray counterpart that rose prior to the gamma-ray outbursts and faded quickly, and radio and infrared counterparts. These features are difficult to reconcile with most models of high energy transients but we show that they are compatible with a white dwarf bound to an intermediate mass black hole that is tidally stripped over multiple pericentre passages before being fully disrupted. Accretion onto the black hole powers a mildly relativistic jet that produces the X-rays through internal processes and the infrared and radio counterparts through thermal emission and external shocks respectively but is unable to produce the gamma-ray emission on its own. We propose that chaotic debris streams from the multiple stripping episodes can collide with a period roughly the same as the orbital period of the star. These shocks produce hard X-ray photons that are upscattered by the jet to produce the observed gamma-ray emission. Future analysis of the jet properties will allow us to place firmer constraints on our model.",

Using cleaned Chandra and VLA data, we derive two-dimensional (2D) and one-dimensional (1D) autocorrelation functions and power spectra, revealing that the fluctuations in both X-ray brightness (approximately tracing plasma density) and radio brightness (tracing magnetic field strength) follow the power-law distributions consistent with Kolmogorov-type turbulence. Specifically, power spectra exhibit a slope $8/3$ in 2D and $5/3$ in 1D analyses, indicating fully developed turbulence across a broad range of spatial scales. The structure functions and spectral slopes remain robust with and without correction for line-of-sight integration effects, suggesting the presence of Kolmogorov-like turbulence locally throughout the remnant's volume. Anisotropies in the 2D autocorrelation function are aligned with known density and magnetic field gradients. Analysis of the 1D radial properties of turbulence confirms Kolmogorov scaling and indicates that modes in the power spectra may be related either to periodicity in the fluctuations or to the physical sizes of bright or dim features in the surface brightness. Our results demonstrate that the Tycho SNR hosts a spatially and temporally developed turbulent cascade, providing insight into the physics of turbulence in SNRs.",

Although synchrotron photons are restricted to keV and a few MeV energies, the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) mechanism can disperse them above hundreds of MeV energies. We present the CRs of the SSC process radiated from the reverse-shock region for the case of a thick and thin shell, considering that the reverse shock lies in the adiabatic regime and evolves in an environment with a homogeneous and stratified medium. We analyze these CRs with the spectral and temporal characteristics of the bursts described in the second \\textit{Fermi}-LAT GRB catalog (2FLGC) and found that i) the thin shell case is preferred over a thick shell and a constant-density medium over a stellar-wind environment, ii) bursts with an atypical and hard spectral index could be successfully described by this scenario in different cooling conditions, iii) the early optical flash and GeV emission exhibited in GRB 160625B and 180720B were generated from the same accelerated region and electron population, concluding that LAT emission originated during the early afterglow, and iv) the maximum synchrotron energy radiated from the reverse-shock scenario could explain only a few photons with the exception of a pair of bursts, so that scattered photons by the SSC process must be required.",

We present a novel investigation using Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations to examine the dynamics of a spherical ejecta in magnetized media, revealing a different formation mechanism for these structures. Our results demonstrate that particle acceleration is significantly enhanced along the magnetic-field direction, producing substantial modifications to shock morphology. These effects naturally generate elongated protrusions bearing a remarkable similarity to the observed SNR ear structures. This magnetic alignment scenario represents a distinct mechanism from the existing jet-based and circumstellar interaction models. Our findings suggest that magnetic field orientation may serve as a crucial diagnostic for distinguishing between different ear formation mechanisms in SNRs.",

Johnson High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The $n=1$ photon ring is a full image of the astrophysical source around a black hole, produced by photons that execute $n\\approx1$ half-orbit around the event horizon on their way to an observer. The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) is a proposed extension of the Event Horizon Telescope to space that will target the $n=1$ photon rings of the supermassive black holes M87${}^\\ast$ and Sgr\\,A${}^\\ast$. In this paper, we introduce a new interferometric observable that will be directly measurable on BHEX baselines and which admits a clear image-domain interpretation in terms of the photon ring brightness profile. Across a wide range of semi-analytic equatorial emission models, we find that the azimuthal intensity profile of the ring can change depending on the astrophysics of the source, but its width $w_b$ is weakly sensitive to these details -- much like the ring shape, which has previously been identified as a probe of the spacetime geometry. Our survey suggests that interferometric measurements of the photon ring diameter and $w_b$ can place constraints (to $\\lesssim\\!20\\%$) on the spin and inclination of a black hole with a known mass-to-distance ratio, such as Sgr\\,A${}^\\ast$. State-of-the-art numerical simulations support this finding, paving the way to a precise photon-ring-based spin measurement for Sgr\\,A${}^\\ast$ with BHEX.",

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Tidal disruptions of stars by supermassive black holes in galactic centers (TDEs) are now being actively studied both theoretically and observationally. They are observed throughout the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio to gamma-rays. It is still unclear how the emission is produced and, in particular, what is the role of the magnetic field of the disrupted star. There are many ways how magnetic fields might affect the dynamics of a TDE. They are likely responsible for the angular momentum transfer in the accretion disk formed at later stages and thus affect the radiation associated with the disk. Magnetic fields are also an important requirement for the formation of relativistic jets, that are seen in some TDEs. The goal of our study is to connect the field within the star to the fields that develop during the fallback and disk accretion. Using the fluid-dynamic code Athena++, we perform a large-scale three-dimensional adaptive-mesh magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a tidal disruption of a magnetized star. The fallback stream returning to the black-hole vicinity after the disruption contains smooth magnetic fields aligned with the stream lines. Formation of a nozzle shock near the pericenter of the initial orbit leads to a turbulent eccentric disk-like structure where the field is amplified and entangled on the local dynamic time scales up to approximate equipartition. The resulting field is mildly anisotropic and has a typical length several times smaller than the pericenter distance. The properties of the field are consistent with the early stages of turbulent dynamo.",

An unambiguous resolution requires that each proposed solution be directly tested through collider experiments probing hadronic interactions. In this work, we develop a framework to assess the strangeness enhancement scenario, wherein an increased yield of kaons relative to pions boosts muon production. Using the MCEQ air-shower simulation package, we first identify the key phase-space regions of hadronic interactions that drive muon yields in this scenario. We then demonstrate that combining Pierre Auger Observatory muon measurements with forthcoming kaon-to-pion ratio data from LHC Run~3 can robustly constrain the scenario's parameters. In particular, we find that achieving 10.8% precision on the kaon-to-pion ratio at LHCb and 8.4% at FASER is sufficient to test the strangeness enhancement hypothesis over its viable parameter space. These upcoming experimental results will provide the first direct constraints on strangeness enhancement as a potential resolution of the muon puzzle.",

Yokoe Progress of Theoretical and Experimental Physics, ptaf133, 25 September 2025 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We study the analysis method to determine the cosmic-ray energy spectra of different mass groups assuming the use of the Tibet AS$\\gamma$ experiment, which consists of the high-density Tibet air-shower array (Tibet-AS) and the underground muon detector (MD) array. These arrays measure the sampling air shower size $\\Sigma\\rho$ and the total muon number $\\Sigma N_{\\mu}$ of each air shower event. These parameters are known to contain information on the energy and mass of the primary particle. To reconstruct the energy spectra of individual cosmic-ray mass groups, we apply a multidimensional unfolding method based on Bayes' theorem to the two-dimensional distribution of $\\Sigma\\rho$ and $\\Sigma N_{\\mu}$ produced by Monte Carlo simulation. Simulated datasets with combinations of the EPOS-LHC, SIBYLL-2.3c, and QGSJET~II-04 high-energy hadronic interaction models and a helium-dominant composition model are analyzed while using a response matrix produced by EPOS-LHC. The unfolded spectra of the EPOS + helium-dominant composition model dataset show a deviation from the input flux within $\\pm$10\\% except for a few bins, meaning that the uncertainty of the technique itself and the composition model dependence is at that level. It is also shown that the deviation in the all-particle spectrum is within $\\pm$10\\% even when using different hadronic interaction models in the dataset and the response matrix. On the other hand, the unfolded spectra of individual mass groups have a clear dependence on the hadronic interaction model. The model dependence of the proton and helium spectra amounts to \\pm25% below 10$^{6.5}$ GeV. The dependence in the carbon group is at a \\pm25% level below 10$^{6}$ GeV, and for the iron spectrum, it amounts to +55% and -30% in the energy range of 10$^{5.1}$ GeV to 10$^{6.7}$ GeV.",

Given the complexity of the analysis of gamma-ray data acquired with Cherenkov telescopes, a proper evaluation of the quality of these data is important to avoid a negative impact on the high-level scientific products. There are several factors that can contribute to reducing the quality of the observations, such as clouds, high humidity or a high dust concentration in the air, among others. In order to take all these factors into account and evaluate their impact on the data, a quality check pipeline has been developed for ASTRI. This contribution describes the pipeline, from its inputs at different data levels to the production of outputs in the form of good-quality lists and diagnostic plots. We also show how setting preliminary quality cuts on the Crab Nebula data taken with the first ASTRI telescope can significantly improve the source detection.",

Presented at the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2025), 2025 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate from explosions at cosmological distances, generating collimated jets. GRB 221009A, exploded on 9 October 2022, has been established as the brightest GRB to date. Its bright and long emission was extensively followed up from radio to gamma rays. LHAASO firmly detected the onset of the afterglow emission at energies up to $\\sim$13 TeV within about an hour after the burst, starting just a few minutes after the trigger. While this VHE emission component can be accounted for in a narrow jet scenario, such an interpretation cannot reproduce the broadband emission observed at later times, which exceeds the theoretical expectations. This discrepancy can be settled if more complex models are considered, providing the first strong evidence for a structured jet in a long GRB. Unfortunately, the VHE emission after a few hours is poorly constrained, as sensitive VHE observations by Cherenkov Telescopes were prevented due to strong moonlight conditions. The first Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1) of the future Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory began observations about one day after the burst under high night sky background conditions. These observations are the first ones performed on GRB 221009A by a Cherenkov telescope, revealing a hint of a signal with a statistical significance of about 4$\\sigma$ during the observations performed at 1.3 days after the burst. The monitoring campaign continued until the end of November 2022, making it the deepest observation campaign performed on a GRB with the LST-1. In this contribution, we will present the analysis results of the LST-1 observation campaign on GRB 221009A in October 2022.",

The Large-Sized Telescope prototype, LST-1, located on the Canary Island of La Palma, is responsible for observation of the low-energy range of the VHE gamma-ray spectrum. It is undergoing commissioning and has already observed the Crab Nebula as a standard reference source. Accurate reconstruction of shower parameters (e.g. energy, direction, and particle type) is crucial for achieving the scientific goals of the CTAO. In this work, we use CTLearn to implement deep-learning event reconstruction, as an alternative to the standard Random Forest method. CTLearn is built to be fully compatible with ctapipe, a framework for prototyping the low-level data processing algorithms for the CTAO, and can be seamlessly used for data analysis without changing the general framework. It implements convolution-neural-network based models that take the integrated charge and the relative peak time of calibrated pixels in cleaned images as an input, to infer the primary particle's properties. Using Crab Nebula observations as a validation sample, we explore two different approaches. The first is to train a model with Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations covering all possible altitude-azimuth coordinates of the Crab Nebula sample observations, resulting in a single model that can be used to reconstruct events from any Crab Nebula observations. The second approach is to train 10 models along this coordinate line, each incorporating a range of \\textasciitilde10° in altitude. In this contribution, we present our investigation of the performance of CTLearn models, and highlight the potential of CTLearn for future data analysis in the CTAO.",

This conversion could lead to two distinct signatures in gamma-ray spectra of blazars: a superimposition of energy-dependent \"wiggles\" on the spectral shape, and a hardening at high (multi-TeV) energies, due to the ALP beam eluding absorption by the extragalactic background light (EBL).

In this contribution, we explore a different approach based on the use of machine learning (ML) classifiers and compare it to the standard method.

The baseline coverage of the 2021 observations is significantly improved through the addition of two new EHT stations: the 12\\,m Kitt Peak Telescope and the Northern Extended Millimetre Array (NOEMA). All observations result in images dominated by a bright, asymmetric ring with a persistent diameter of $43.9\\pm 0.6\\,\\muas$, consistent with expectations for lensed synchrotron emission encircling the apparent shadow of a supermassive black hole. We find that the total intensity and linear polarization of \\m87 vary significantly across the three epochs. Specifically, the azimuthal brightness distribution of the total intensity images varies from year to year, as expected for a stochastic accretion flow. However, despite a gamma-ray flare erupting in M87 quasi-contemporaneously to the 2018 observations, the 2018 and 2021 images look remarkably similar. The resolved linear polarization fractions in 2018 and 2021 peak at $\\sim$5\\%, compared to $\\sim$15\\% in 2017. The spiral polarization pattern on the ring also varies from year to year, including a change in the electric vector position angle helicity in 2021 that could reflect changes in the magnetized accretion flow or an external Faraday screen. The improved 2021 coverage also provides the first EHT constraints on jet emission outside the ring, on scales of $\\lesssim 1$\\,mas. Overall, these observations provide strong proof of the reliability of the EHT images and probe the dynamic properties of the horizon-scale accretion flow surrounding \\m87.",

We present a pulse phase-resolved X-ray spectral analysis of data from an archival XMM-Newton observation of Cen X-3 taken during the high state of the source. The observation was entirely in the out-of-eclipse part of the binary orbit. We study the pulse phase variability of the three K${\\alpha}$ fluorescent emission lines from near-neutral, Helium-like and Hydrogen-like iron, along with the iron K${\\beta}$ emission line. All four lines show clear modulation with the pulse phase of the neutron star, and modulation is found to be higher for the lines from highly ionised iron compared to the neutral lines. Structures within the light travel distance corresponding to the pulse period of the neutron star are likely responsible for the pulse phase modulation of the emission lines. We have also investigated the orbital phase dependence of the pulse phase variability in the iron lines by dividing the data into four segments at different orbital phases of Cen X-3. The pulse phase modulation behaviour of the four lines is quite identical at different orbital phases of Cen X-3, indicating the pulsed iron emission region is persistent in nature and probably phase aligned with respect to the observer. The accretion stream intercepting the line of sight can probably produce the observed phase dependence of the iron fluorescence emission lines.",

While they have often been considered to be a brief but very important transitional phase in the evolution of massive single stars, mounting evidence suggests that LBVs are actually a phenomenon associated with binary star evolution by way of mass gainers and mergers. If true, this would leave single massive stars without a way to shed their H envelopes and become Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, requiring a revision of our most basic paradigm of massive star evolution. Understanding their properties and role in evolution is therefore extremely important. The eruptive mass loss of LBVs is also invoked to account for some of the most extraordinary supernovae (SNe) with dense circumstellar material (CSM), which again contradicts the standard single star scenario where LBVs are massive stars in transition to the WR phase. This chapter reviews many aspects of LBVs including terminology and classification, the physical properties of the stars, their mass loss, and their variability, as well as their observed companion stars, implications of their surrounding stellar populations, and their circumstellar nebulae. These are put into context with proposed evolutionary scenarios and possible mechanisms that drive their eruptive variability.",

Osmanov High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We study the effects of pair creation on the radiation emerging from black holes under the assumption that the magnetic fields are vortex driven. In particular, for a sufficiently broad range of supermassive black holes, we investigated the energies at which photons undergo decay under the influence of a strong magnetic field, producing electron-positron pairs. Depending on particular physical parameters, it has been shown that in certain scenarios high or very high energy emission generated by black holes will be strongly suppressed, thus, will be unable to escape a zone where radiation is generated. In particular, photons with energies exceeding $\\sim 1$ GeV will never leave the magnetosphere if they are generated at the scale 10$R_g$ and the threshold is of the order of $1$ TeV, if the emission is produced at $\\sim 100\\; R_g$.

Includes main, methods and supplementary information High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Recent observations have revealed rare, previously unknown flashes of cosmic radio waves lasting from milliseconds to minutes, and with periodicity of minutes to an hour. These transient radio signals must originate from sources in the Milky Way, and from coherent emission processes in astrophysical plasma. They are theorized to be produced in the extreme and highly magnetised environments around white dwarfs or neutron stars. However, the astrophysical origin of these signals remains contested, and multiple progenitor models may be needed to explain their diverse properties. Here we present the discovery of a transient radio source, ILT J1101+5521, whose roughly minute-long pulses arrive with a periodicity of 125.5 minutes. We find that ILT J1101+5521 is an M dwarf -- white dwarf binary system with an orbital period that matches the period of the radio pulses, which are observed when the two stars are in conjunction. The binary nature of ILT J1101+5521 establishes that some long-period radio transients originate from orbital motion modulating the observed emission, as opposed to an isolated rotating star. We conclude that ILT J1101+5521 is likely a polar system where magnetic interaction has synchronised the rotational and orbital periods of the white dwarf. Magnetic interaction and plasma exchange between two stars has been theorized to generate sporadic radio emission, making ILT J1101+5521 a potential low-mass analogue to such mechanisms.",

However, incorporating realistic magnetic field structures is computationally prohibitive, severely constraining feasible parameter space exploration. In this work, we develop a neural network (NN) emulator to generate model thermal bolometric X-ray light curves of millisecond pulsars with multipolar magnetic fields. We assess the NN's predictive and computational performance across a broad parameter space. We find that for a static vacuum field model, the NN provides a >400 times speedup. We integrate this NN emulator into a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) framework to replace the computationally expensive physical model during parameter exploration. Applied to PSR J0030+0451, this approach allows the MCMC to reach equilibrium in ~1 day on 4000 cores, where with the original physical model alone it would have taken more than a year on the same hardware. We compare posterior distributions by running equivalent MCMC iterations with both the NN and the physical model, evaluate differences in distributions when continuing the physical model MCMC from the NN MCMC equilibrium state, and assess variations in posterior distributions resulting from NNs trained on datasets of different sizes. Our NN architecture is agnostic to the underlying physics of the physical model and can be trained for any other physical model, opening many previously intractable avenues of analysis. The NN speed remains the same regardless of the complexity of the physical model it was trained to emulate, allowing greater speedups for more complex physical models.",

Harding, Paul T. Kolbeck 44 pages, 32 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We detail new force-free simulations to investigate magnetosphere evolution and precursor electromagnetic (EM) signals from binary neutron stars. Our simulations fully follow a representative inspiral motion, capturing the intricate magnetospheric dynamics and their impact on EM outflows. We explore a range of stellar magnetic moment orientations and relative strengths, finding that the magnetospheres and Poynting flux evolution are strongly configuration-dependent. The Poynting flux exhibits pulsations at twice the orbital frequency, $2\\Omega$, and is highly anisotropic, following a power-law dependence on orbital frequency. The index ranges from 1 to 6, shaped by the intricate dynamics of the magnetospheres. Furthermore, we present the first computation of: (1) The EM forces acting on the star surfaces, revealing the presence of torques that, for highly-magnetized stars, could influence the orbital dynamics or break the crust. (2) The high-energy emission signals from these systems by adopting the established isolated pulsar theory. Assuming curvature radiation in the radiation reaction limit, we find that photons could reach TeV--PeV energies in the last $\\sim$~ms for magnetic field strengths $10^{10}-10^{15}$~G. However, our analysis of single photon magnetic pair production suggests that these photons are unlikely to escape, with the MeV band emerging as a promising observational window for precursor high-energy emission. In this framework, we construct high-energy emission skymaps and light curves, exploring observational implications. Finally, we propose potential precursor radio emission and delayed afterglow echoes from magnetized outflows, which may contribute to late-time re-brightening in short gamma-ray bursts or to orphan afterglows.",

Updated to match published version High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) sources in galactic nuclei are often associated with a stellar object orbiting a supermassive black hole with hours-days period, brought in as an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI). In the presence of an accretion disk, repeated star-disk collisions lead to ablation of a small fraction of the stellar mass during each disk passage. We analytically follow the evolution of the stellar debris as it is tidally stretched outside the EMRI's Hill sphere, forming an elongated, dilute stream, that subsequently collides with the disk, half an orbit after the previous star-disk encounter. At sufficiently long orbital periods ($\\gtrsim 12$ hr), the stream is too dilute to penetrate the disk, and is instead strongly shocked and deflected at its surface through a reverse shock. We obtain the resulting emission and explore implications for QPE observations. Due to their low optical depth and prolonged interaction time, radiation from the shocked streams typically dominates over that from shocked disk gas directly impacted by the star or by ejecta confined within its Hill sphere, as was first proposed by Yao et al. 2025. We find that: (1) QPE flare durations reflect the stream-disk collision timescale; (2) Flare luminosities of $10^{42-43}$ erg/s, consistent with observed QPEs, are robustly produced; (3) Soft X-ray flares with temperatures of ${\\sim}$100 eV arise when the stream mass is sufficient to sustain a radiation mediated shock at the collision interface. Higher mass streams yield softer flares, typically outshone by the disk, while lower mass streams result in collisionless shocks, which likely produce fainter and harder flares. We discuss observational implications of the temporal evolution of the underlying disk, assuming it is the remnant of a prior tidal disruption event in the same galaxy.",

To be published in PASA High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a new method to calculate the polarised synchrotron emission of radio AGN sources using magnetic field information from 3-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (RMHD) simulations. Like its predecessor, which uses pressure as a proxy for the magnetic field, this method tracks the spatially resolved adiabatic and radiative loss processes using the method adapted from the Radio AGN in Semi-analytic Environments formalism. Lagrangian tracer particles in RMHD simulations carried out using the PLUTO code are used to track the fluid quantities of each `ensemble of electrons' through time to calculate the radio emissivity ex-situ. By using the magnetic field directly from simulations, the full set of linear Stokes parameters I, Q, and U can be calculated to study the synthetic radio polarisation of radio AGN sources. We apply this method to a suite of RMHD simulations to study their polarisation properties. The turbulent magnetic field present in radio lobes influences the emission, causing a complex clumpy structure that is visible at high resolution. Our synthetic polarisation properties are consistent with observations; we find that the fractional polarisation is highest (approximately 50 percent) at the lobe edges. We show that for the same source, the integrated and mean fractional polarisation depends on viewing angle to the source. At oblique viewing angles the behaviour of the integrated and mean fractional polarisation over time depends on the morphology of the jet cocoon. Using Faraday rotation measures, we reproduce known depolarisation effects such as the Laing-Garrington depolarisation asymmetry in jets angled to the line of sight. We show that the hotspots and hence the Fanaroff-Riley classification become less clear with our new, more accurate method.",

Comments are welcome. Code available at this https URL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous astrophysical transients, known to be associated with core collapse of massive stars or mergers of two compact objects such as two neutron stars. They are followed by multi-wavelength afterglow emission originating from the deceleration of the relativistic jets by the ambient medium. The study of afterglow emission offers crucial insights into the physics of relativistic shocks, the properties of the circumburst environment, the physical and geometrical structure of relativistic jets, as well as the viewing geometry of the observer. We present {\\tt VegasAfterglow}, a newly developed, high-performance C++ framework designed for modeling GRB afterglows with flexibility and computational efficiency as key features of design. The framework self-consistently solves forward and reverse shock dynamics and calculates synchrotron (including self-absorption or all spectral regimes) and inverse Compton radiation (including Klein-Nishina corrections); it can handle arbitrary user-defined ambient density profiles, central engine activity histories, viewing angles, and the jet structures of energy, Lorentz factor, and magnetization profiles. It supports both relativistic and non-relativistic regimes and includes lateral jet spreading effects. In this paper, we describe the numerical implementation of the framework and assess its computational performance.

We compare the binary slim disk solutions with corresponding binary thin disk solutions, calculate the disk spectrum, explore the impact of different parameters on the system, and estimate the binary shrinkage timescale. We find that; (1) due to the different disk density profiles, the integrated tidal torque exerted on the disk is significantly smaller for the slim disk than for the thin disk; as a result thin disks onto binary black holes can be radiatively significantly more efficient than slim disks; (2) The presence of the secondary alters the emission of the circumbinary disk, making it different from the spectrum of a single black hole Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN); (3) The tidal torque boosts the viscous torque in the outer part of the disk (radii greater than the binary separation), which is strongly dependent on the disk parameters, including the binary mass ratio $q$, the orbital separation $a$, the viscous parameter $\\alpha$ and the accretion rate $\\dot M$; (4) The vertical component of the potential of the secondary slightly decreases the integrated tidal torque.

Li, Mathieu Renzo, Maximiliano Isi High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) GW231123, the most massive binary black hole (BH) merger observed to date, involves component BHs with masses inside the pair-instability mass gap and unusually high spins. This challenges standard formation channels such as classical stellar evolution and hierarchical mergers. However, stellar rotation and magnetic fields, which have not been systematically incorporated in prior models, can strongly influence the BH properties. We present the first self-consistent simulations tracking a massive, low-metallicity helium star from helium core burning through collapse, BH formation, and post-BH formation accretion using 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. Starting from a $250\\,M_\\odot$ helium core, we show that collapse above the pair-instability mass gap, aided by rotation and magnetic fields, drives mass loss through disk winds and jet launching. This enables the formation of highly spinning BHs within the mass gap and reveals a BH spin-mass correlation. Strong magnetic fields extract angular momentum from the BH through magnetically driven outflows, which in turn suppress accretion, resulting in slowly spinning BHs within the mass gap. In contrast, stars with weak fields permit nearly complete collapse and spin-up of the BH to $ a\\approx1$. We show that massive low-metallicity stars with moderate magnetic fields naturally produce BHs whose masses and spins match those inferred for GW231123, and are also consistent with those of GW190521. The outflows may impart a BH kick, which can induce spin-orbit misalignment and widen the post-collapse orbit, delaying the merger. The outflows launched during collapse may power short-lived, high-luminosity jets comparable to the most energetic $\\gamma$-ray bursts, offering a potential observational signature of such events in the early universe.",

Amato, C. Malacaria 8 pages, 6 figures, A&A accepted on 3 Sept. 2025 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) High-Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs) serve as useful laboratories for exploring the behaviour of accreted matter onto compact objects and for probing the complex wind environments of massive stars. These investigations are essential for understanding stellar life cycles and the dynamics of the Milky Way, and they are prominent topics in the science cases for XRISM and NewAthena. We report, for the first time, a XRISM observation of the HMXB Vela X-1, conducted during the first cycle of the XRISM general observer programme and complemented by simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR coverage. This campaign targeted a critical orbital phase -- when the neutron star is in inferior conjunction -- during which significant changes in absorption are expected. We performed absorption-resolved spectral analyses during two time intervals of interest: the soft and hard hardness ratio (HR) intervals, as it is strongly correlated with absorption variability. We observed a sudden transition in the HR from a soft to a hard state, coinciding with an increase in the absorption column density. This is likely attributed to the onset of the accretion structure crossing our line of sight. With XRISM/Resolve, we also investigated the Fe K region, and we report for the first time the presence of a Fe K$\\alpha$ doublet in the spectrum of Vela X-1, together with the presence of already known Fe K$\\beta$ and Ni K$\\alpha$ lines that are produced in cold clumps embedded in the hot ionised wind. The measured line velocities of the order of $10^2 \\ \\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$ are consistent with production sites in the vicinity of the neutron star. This precursor study with Vela X-1 shows the potential of XRISM in studying in unprecedented details the spectral evolution of wind-accreting X-ray binaries.",

Planned for installation at Cerro Toco in the Atacama Desert, Chile, at 5300 meters above sea level (m.a.s.l.), CONDOR is optimized to operate in the 100 GeV to 1 TeV range using the extensive air-shower technique. The design prioritizes simplicity, modularity, and robustness to ensure reliable performance in a harsh environment. The CONDOR array has a full coverage factor of 90 and consists of 6000 plastic scintillator panels, each approximately 1 m^2, read by wavelength-shifting fibers and SiPMs. The readout electronics are based on fast ADCs, with White Rabbit technology ensuring time synchronization. We present an analysis of angular resolution and effective area by variation of the CORSIKA design to meet the developing GeV threshold, complementing other ground-based observatories in gamma-ray and proton CR measurements. CONDOR has the potential to support an extensive research program in astroparticle physics and multimessenger astronomy from the Southern Hemisphere, operating in all-sky mode 24 hours per day, year-round, with satellite data ranges.",

They are presumed to have been ejected from their birth places by one or more energetic mechanisms, including supernova explosions. Accurate radial velocities are essential for investigating their origin, by tracing back their Galactic orbits to look for close encounters in space and in time with neutron stars and young associations. While most studies of runaways have focused on OB stars, later-type stars have also been considered on occasion. Here we report the results of a long-term high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring program with the goal of providing accurate radial velocities for 188 runaway candidates of spectral type A and later, proposed by Tetzlaff et al. (2011). We obtained multiple measurements over a period of about 13 yr to guard against the possibility that some may be members of binary or multiple systems, adding archival observations going back another 25 yr in some cases. We report new spectroscopic orbital solutions for more than three dozen systems. Many more are also found to be binaries based on available astrometric information. A small-scale study carried out here to trace back the paths of our targets together with those of four well-studied, optically-visible neutron stars among the so-called Magnificent Seven, resulted in no credible encounters.",

This study analyses relativistic and ultra-relativistic electron occurrence and loss timescales within the CRRES High Energy Electron Fluxometer (HEEF) dataset, including during several strong and severe geomagnetic storms that all, remarkably, flooded the slot region with multi-MeV electrons. These allow the first definitive multi-MeV electron lifetimes to be calculated in this region and indicate an elevated risk to satellites in slot region orbits during periods of heightened solar activity. The HEEF outer belt loss timescales are broadly in agreement with those from later solar cycles, but differences include longer-lasting sub-MeV electrons near the inner region of the outer belt and faster-decaying multi-MeV electrons near geosynchronous orbit. These differences are associated with higher levels of geomagnetic activity, a phenomenon that enables the spread in the results to be parameterised accordingly. The timescales generally appear well-bounded by Kp-dependent theoretical predictions, but the variability within the spread is not always well-ordered by geomagnetic activity. This suggests the limitations of using pitch-angle diffusion to account for the decay of elevated electrons following geomagnetic storms, and the need for more sophisticated space weather indices for radiation belt forecasting.",

Capturing both the turbulence cascade and damping is therefore crucial for models of energy conversion, plasma heating, and particle transport in diverse plasma environments, but remains challenging. Progress is constrained by two unresolved fundamental questions: the persistence of the turbulence cascade in the presence of shocks and discontinuities, and the validity of classical wave theories under strong nonlinearity. In particular, it remains unclear whether meaningful cascade dynamics can be defined in compressible turbulence with phase steepening, and whether frameworks developed for monochromatic waves remain applicable to complex, broadband fluctuations. Using large-scale, high-resolution kinetic simulations, we analyze turbulence-particle interactions, which are beyond the capability of standard magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. We show that compressible turbulence damping at MHD scales in quantitative agreement with transit-time damping theory, even in fully developed nonlinear states. Moreover, the cascade persists despite the generation of shocks and discontinuities due to phase steepening, revealing a surprising robustness of cross-scale energy transfer under extreme conditions. We further provide the spectral expression of compressible turbulence. These results close a long-standing gap in the physics of compressible turbulence and establish a robust foundation for turbulence modeling from the heliosphere to galaxies.",

Williams, Smadar Naoz, Naoki Yoshida, William Lake, Blakesley Burkhart, Federico Marinacci, Mark Vogelsberger, Shyam H. Menon, Avi Chen, Kyle Kremer Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The formation of the Universe's first luminous stellar structures depends on the unique conditions at \"Cosmic Dawn,\" which are set by the underlying cosmological model and early baryonic physics. Observations suggest that high-$z$ star clusters reached stellar surface densities above $10^5 M_\\odot$ pc$^{-2}$, suggesting scenarios where models predict that the ability of stellar feedback to counter gravitational collapse is severely limited. We investigate the first star clusters in a suite of AREPO simulations, which explore the capacity for $\\Lambda$CDM halos to maximally form high-density systems without feedback. We include the effects of the supersonic baryon-dark matter streaming velocity, an effect that impacts gas density and distribution in early minihalos. We show that early star clusters can reach high densities even in regions of strong supersonic streaming, provided feedback is weak. We analyze the interplay of the stream velocity and the dynamical processes of structure formation, finding that JWST has the opportunity to detect the brightest, most massive objects in our computational box. The detection of individual $z\\geq12$ Pop III star clusters below $10^7M_\\odot$ is challenging, although lensing could reveal these objects in rare configurations, especially if a top-heavy IMF is present. We find that accounting for baryonic clusters separately from dark matter halos complicates predictions for the faint-end of the high-$z$ UVLF, with competing effects from the stream velocity and low-mass clusters outside of halos. Finally, we explore clustering of star clusters as a promising probe of the stream velocity in these systems.",

We crossmatch dwarf galaxy positions in the NASA-Sloan Atlas with X-ray sources from eRASS and apply rigorous criteria to remove contaminants such as background sources, galaxies with dubious stellar masses, and X-ray binaries. Potential contamination from ultraluminous X-ray sources is also assessed. We ultimately assemble a sample of 27 X-ray-selected AGN candidates in dwarf galaxies with stellar masses $M_{*} = 10^{7.5-9.5} M_{\\odot}$ and redshifts $z<0.15$. An analysis of the host galaxy properties reveals that the AGN candidates are predominantly situated in systems with $g-r$ colors, star formation rates, and concentrations typical of the broader dwarf galaxy population. Detailed examination of the X-ray sources indicates that most AGN candidates in our sample are consistent with being located in the nuclear regions of their host galaxies and exhibit Eddington ratios ranging between $\\lambda_{Edd} \\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-1}$, with a few radiating at/above their Eddington limit. Notably, our methodology identifies 15 previously unreported AGNs candidates, highlighting the complementary nature of our approach to the existing literature.",

We report 10 pc-scale measurements of the mass of young stars, ionized gas, and older disk stars coincident with each HII region, as well as the initial and current mass of molecular gas, atomic gas, and swept-up shell material, estimated from lower resolution data. We find that the mass of older stars dominates over young stars at $\\gtrsim10\\rm\\,pc$ scales, and ionized gas exceeds the stellar mass in most optically bright HII regions. Combining our mass measurements for a statistically large sample of HII regions, we derive 10 pc scale star-formation efficiencies $\\approx6{-}17\\%$ for individual HII regions. Comparing each region's self-gravity with the ambient ISM pressure and total pressure from pre-supernova stellar feedback, we show that most optically bright HII regions are over-pressured relative to their own self-gravity and the ambient ISM pressure, and that they are hence likely expanding into their surroundings. Larger HII regions in galaxy centers approach dynamical equilibrium. The self-gravity of regions is expected to dominate over pre-supernova stellar feedback pressure at $\\gtrsim130\\rm\\,pc$ and $60\\rm\\,pc$ scales in galaxy disks and centers, respectively, but is always sub-dominant to the ambient ISM pressure on HII region scales.

Konstantopoulos 26 pages, 10 figures, Accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Stephan's Quintet (SQ) is a local compact galaxy group system that exhibits significant star formation activity. A history of tidal interactions between its four member galaxies and a recent collision between an intruder galaxy and the original group are associated with active star formation, particularly in many shocked regions in the intra-group medium. Using an existing star cluster candidate (SCC) catalog constructed from HST UV/optical images, we integrate flux measurements from five near-infrared filters (F090W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W) obtained from JWST NIRCam observations in 2022. Leveraging the extended photometric baseline from HST and JWST, spanning ~300 nm to ~3500 nm, we perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using the CIGALE code to derive reliable estimates of age, mass, and extinction for the 1,588 high-confidence SCCs. We confirm earlier results that very young SCCs (~a few Myr) are predominantly located along previously identified shock regions near the merging galaxies, while older (>100 Myr) and globular clusters are more widely distributed. Our analysis shows that NIR photometry helps break the age-extinction degeneracy, reclassifying many SCCs from older to younger, moderately dust-extincted clusters when added to HST-based SED fits. We also observe a strong spatial correlation between young clusters and CO-traced molecular gas, although active star formation is present in several regions with no detectable CO. We find that the two prominent epochs of star formation, around 5 Myr and 200 Myr, correspond to the two major interaction events in SQ that gave rise to the observed extended tidal features.",

Although the strong tidal field in the cluster environment accelerates the mass loss of the satellites, only 20\\% of tidal-featured galaxies form their tidal features purely due to tidal perturbation in the cluster environment, without any interactions with other galaxies before falling into the cluster. In contrast, the majority (80\\%) is affected by the preprocessing, as they experienced merging events with other galaxies before infalling into the cluster. Among this preprocessing population, 45\\% of all tidal-featured galaxies form their tidal features after passing the pericenter of the cluster, affected by both preprocessing and the tidal field of the cluster, whereas 35\\% of all tidal-featured galaxies form their tidal features before reaching the pericenter, primarily due to preprocessing. Notably, this fraction increases from 35\\% to 40-50\\% when we focus only on galaxies with brighter surface brightness limits or higher stellar mass. Therefore, our results highlight that preprocessing is an important channel for forming tidal features within clusters. However, the importance of preprocessing may be further amplified in observations, since more massive galaxies, which are commonly associated with preprocessing, are preferentially detected.",

Submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Main Sequence of Star-Forming Galaxies (SFGMS or MS) is a fundamental scaling relation that provides a global framework for studying galaxy formation and evolution, as well as insight into the complex star formation histories (SFHs) of individual galaxies. In this work, we combine large-area pre-JWST surveys (COSMOS2020, CANDELS), which probe high-$M_\\star$ sources (${>10^9\\,M_\\odot}$), with SHARDS/CANDELS FAINT and JWST data from CANUCS, CEERS, JADES, and UNCOVER, to obtain a high-$z$, star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass ($M_\\star$) complete sample spanning both high- and low-$M_\\star$ regimes. Completeness in both $M_\\star$ and SFR is key to avoiding biases introduced by low-mass, highly star-forming objects. Our combined data set is 80% complete down to $10^{7.6}\\,M_\\odot$ at $z\\sim1$ ($10^{8.8}\\,M_\\odot$ at $z\\sim9$). The overall intrinsic MS slope (based on the SFR$_{100}$ and $M_\\star$ derived with Dense Basis and nonparametric SFHs) shows little evolution up to $z\\sim5$, with values $\\sim0.7 - 0.8$. The slope in the low-$M_\\star$ regime becomes steeper than that in the high-$M_\\star$ end at least up to $z\\sim5$, but the strength of this change is highly dependent on the assumptions made on the symmetry of the uncertainties in $M_\\star$ and SFR. If real, the steepening suggests reduced star formation efficiency or declining gas content with decreasing $M_\\star$. The transition between the low-$M_\\star$ regime and the canonical MS occurs around $10^{9.5}\\,M_\\odot$, independent of $z$. This critical value may coincide with the assembly of galaxies' disks, which can provide a mechanism for self-regulation that stabilizes them against feedback. The intrinsic scatter is compatible with canonical estimates, also at low-$M_\\star$, ranging from $0.2-0.3$ dex. This is indicative of rapid variations in star formation being averaged out over $\\lesssim100$ Myr.",

Cerqueira, R. Carvajal, J. Fonseca 18 pages, 9 figures. Published on A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) In this work, we test whether gradient-boosting algorithms, trained on broadband photometric data from traditional Lyman-$\\alpha$ emitting (LAE) surveys, can efficiently and accurately identify LAE candidates from typical star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts and brightness levels. Using galaxy samples at $z \\in [2,6]$ derived from the COSMOS2020 and SC4K catalogs, we trained gradient-boosting machine-learning algorithms (LGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost) using optical and near-infrared broadband photometry. To ensure balanced performance, the models were trained on carefully selected datasets with similar redshift and i-band magnitude distributions. Additionally, the models were tested for robustness by perturbing the photometric data using the associated observational uncertainties. Our classification models achieved F1-scores of $\\sim 87\\%$ and successfully identified about $7,000$ objects with an unanimous agreement across all models. This more than doubles the number of LAEs identified in the COSMOS field compared with the SC4K dataset. We managed to spectroscopically confirm 60 of these LAE candidates using the publicly available catalogs in the COSMOS field. These results highlight the potential of machine learning in efficiently identifying LAEs candidates. This lays the foundations for applications to larger photometric surveys, such as Euclid and LSST. By complementing traditional approaches and providing robust preselection capabilities, our models facilitate the analysis of these objects. This is crucial to increase our knowledge of the overall LAE population.",

Accepted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present dynamical masses for 23 pre-main sequence K- and M-type stars in the Upper Scorpius star-forming region. These masses were derived from the Keplerian rotation of CO disk gas using the MCMC radiative-transfer package pdspy and a flared-disk model with 15 free parameters. We compare our dynamical masses to those derived from five pre-main sequence evolutionary models, and find that most models consistently underestimate stellar mass by $\\gtrsim$25%. Models with updated treatment of stellar magnetic fields are a notable exception $-$ they consistently return stellar masses in good agreement with the dynamical results. We find that the magnetic models' performance is valid even at low masses, in contrast with some literature results suggesting they may overestimate stellar mass for M$_{\\star}$ $\\lesssim$ 0.6 M$_{\\odot}$. Our results are consistent with dynamical versus isochronal evaluations for younger samples (e.g. Taurus, 1-3 Myr), and extend the systematic evaluation of stellar evolutionary models up to stars $\\sim$11 Myr in age. Finally, we derive disk dust masses to evaluate whether using dynamical masses versus isochronal masses changes the slope of the log(M$_{dust}$)$-$log(M$_{\\star}$) relation. We derive a slightly shallower relation using dynamical masses versus isochronal masses, but the slopes of these relations agree within uncertainties. In all cases, we derive a steeper-than-linear relation for log(M$_{dust}$)$-$log(M$_{\\star}$), consistent with previous literature results for Upper Sco.",

Accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a comparative analysis of interstellar hydrogen (HI) and potassium (KI) absorption from the radio and optical surveys, GASKAP and GALAH, to study the physical and kinematic properties of the cold interstellar medium (ISM) in the Milky Way foreground towards the Magellanic Clouds. By comparing GASKAP HI absorption with interstellar KI absorption detected in GALAH spectra of nearby stars (within 12 arcmin angular distance or a spatial separation of ~0.75 pc), we reveal a strong kinematic correlation between these two tracers of the cold neutral ISM. The velocity offsets between matched HI and KI absorption components are small, with a mean (median) offset of -1.3 (-1.2) km s-1 and a standard deviation of 2.3 km s-1. The high degree of kinematic consistency suggests a close spatial association between Ki and cold HI gas. Correlation analyses reveal a moderate positive relationship between HI and KI line-of-sight properties, such as KI column density with HI column density or HI brightness temperature. We observe a ~63% overlap in the detection of both species towards 290 (out of 462) GASKAP HI absorption lines of sight, and estimate a median KI/HI abundance ratio of ~2.3 x 10^(-10), in excellent agreement with previous findings. Our work opens up an exciting avenue of Galactic research that uses large-scale surveys in the radio and optical wavelengths to probe the neutral interstellar medium through its diverse tracers.",

These DPGs show double-peaked Balmer lines and forbidden lines in the spectra. We use a double Gaussian model to separate the double-peaked profiles of each emission line into blue and red components ($\\lambda_\\text{blue}$ < $\\lambda_\\text{red}$), and analyze the spatially resolved kinematics and ionization mechanisms of each component. We find that in 35 out of 36 DPGs, the flux ratio between the blue and red components varies systematically along the major axes, while it keeps roughly a constant along the minor axes. The blue and red components of these DPGs exhibit similar distributions in both the value of line-of-sight velocity and the velocity dispersion. Additionally, 83.3% DPGs have both blue and red components located in the same ionization region in the [SII]-BPT diagram. Combining all these observational results, we suggest that the double-peaked emission line profiles in these 35 DPGs primarily originate from rotating discs. The remaining one galaxy shows clear outflow features. 8 out of 35 DPGs show symmetric line profiles that indicate undisturbed rotating discs, and the other 27 DPGs exhibit asymmetric profiles, suggesting dynamic disturbances in the rotating discs. Furthermore, we find that 58.3% DPGs experienced external processes, characterized by tidal features, companion galaxies, as well as gas-star misalignments. This fraction is about twice as much as that of the control sample, suggesting the origin of double-peaked emission line profiles is associated with external processes.",

Aguerri, Lorenzo Morelli, Nelvy Choque-Challapa, Stefano Zarattini Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Context. Bars are elongated structures developed by a large fraction of disk galaxies in their central few kiloparsecs. However, the bar formation process is still not fully understood, particularly the role played by the galaxy environment in the formation and evolution of these structures. Aims. The aim of this work is to establish how the galaxy environment affects the evolution of bars by analyzing the bar structural parameters in a sample of galaxies located in three different galaxy environments: in the Virgo cluster, in filaments in the Cosmic Web around it, and in the field. Methods. We performed structural analysis using optical imaging from the DESI Legacy survey, measuring bar radii and disk scale lengths through Fourier analysis and surface brightness fitting techniques. Results. After defining a homogeneous sample of barred galaxies across the three different galaxy environments in terms of color and magnitude, the median bar radii were found to be 2.54 +/- 0.34 kpc, 3.29 +/- 0.38 kpc, and 4.44 +/- 0.81 kpc in the cluster, filaments, and field environments, respectively. In addition, the median bar radii scaled by the disk scale lengths was found to be 1.26 +/- 0.09, 1.72 +/- 0.11, and 2.57 +/- 0.21 in the cluster, filaments, and field environments, respectively. These results indicate that the galaxy environment has a significant influence on the structural parameters of bars, with bars in high-density environments being shorter and less prominent than those in the field. Conclusions. Our findings can be interpreted in terms of a slowing of the secular evolution of bars in dense galaxy environments. Barred galaxies located in clusters could experience a reduced rate of bar secular evolution due to various physical processes that occur in high-density environments, such as gas stripping, strangulation, or tidal interactions.",

Primack, Joanna Woo Submitted to ApJ; 34 pages, 15 figures in main text; comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We leverage the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations to test how the large-scale cosmic web shapes galaxy morphology and to forecast the early cosmic web structure that the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will reveal. In the hydrodynamic TNG50 and $N$-body TNG50-Dark runs, we reconstruct the cosmic web at redshifts $z=0$, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 with the Monte Carlo Physarum Machine density estimator and the DisPerSE structure identification framework. We confirm that dark matter halos start out predominantly prolate (elongated) and their shapes are aligned with their nearest filaments; prolate galaxies retain strong shape-alignment with their outer halos to later times. The fraction of prolate galaxies and halos increases toward lower stellar mass, higher redshift, and lower-density filaments. Oblate and spheroidal galaxies show weaker trends with filament density, but spheroidal halos preferentially reside in higher-density filaments. We also find that higher-density filaments favor extended rotationally-supported disks, whereas lower-density filaments more often host smaller dispersion-supported systems. Then, generating mock galaxy samples from TNG100 and TNG50, we predict the early cosmic web accessible to Roman. We find that the spectroscopic emission-line depth planned for the High-Latitude Wide-Area Survey (HLWAS) yields a highly incomplete galaxy sample that does not accurately trace the $z=1$ cosmic web. A survey $\\geq2.5\\times$ deeper over a few square degrees would enable a proper reconstruction and reveal qualitatively correct filament-galaxy morphology relationships. Nevertheless, the planned HLWAS Deep field should still identify most galaxy overdensities; targeted deeper spectroscopy of these regions would efficiently and adequately map the early filamentary structure.",

We combined them to construct a unified RC from $R=0$ to $\\sim 25$ kpc and decomposed the curve into bulge, disc and dark halo components with high precision.

In this paper, we utilize precise distances for RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) derived from the period-absolute magnitude-metallicity (PMZ) relation, along with proper motions from Gaia DR3, to conduct a large-volume search for HVSs. Our sample consists of a catalog with 8,172 RRLs with metallicity, distance and radial velocities estimated from SDSS and LAMOST spectroscopic data, and an extended catalog of 135,873 RRLs with metallicity and distance estimated from Gaia photometry. After careful quality cuts, 165 hypervelocity RRL candidates were found. We performed further checks on their light curves, and selected the most reliable 87 hypervelocity RRLs. All of them exceed the Milky Way's escape velocity in the tangential component. Among them, 7 stars have tangential velocity over 800 km s^-1. We identified two spatially distinct distributions of hypervelocity RRLs: one concentrated toward the Galactic Center and another localized around the Magellanic Clouds, suggesting that their origins are likely associated with these regions through the Hills or other mechanisms. Furthermore, we detected a significant number of RRLs associated with dwarf galaxies that exceed the Milky Way's escape velocity, likely ejected from their host systems.

To overcome this limitation, we employ GC-SWGAN, a semi-supervised learning method developed by \\citet{2025ApJS..279...17L}, to systematically identify DLSGs within the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI-LS). The methodology involves training a generative adversarial network (GAN) on unlabeled galaxy images to extract morphological features, followed by fine-tuning the model using a small dataset of labeled DLSGs. In our experiments, despite DLSGs constituting only $\\sim$ 3.7\\% of the test set, GC-SWGAN achieves remarkable performance, with an 87\\% recall rate, 84\\% accuracy, and an F1 score of 86\\%, underscoring its efficacy for DLSG detection. Applying this model to $\\sim$ 310,000 DESI-LS galaxies that meet the criteria $m_r < 17.0$ and $0.01 < z < 0.07$ we compile the largest catalog of DLSG candidates to date, identifying 9,482 dust-lane ETGs. A preliminary analysis reveals that these DLSGs exhibit significantly redder $g-r$ colors and higher specific star formation rates compared to non-DLSGs. This catalog enables future studies of ISM properties in ETGs and the role of minor mergers in driving star formation in the nearby universe.",

      "abstract": "GravSphere2: A higher-order Jeans method for mass-modeling spherical stellar systems Andrés Bañares-Hernández, Justin I. Read, Mariana P. Júlio Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Mass-modeling methods are used to infer the gravitational field of stellar systems, from globular clusters to giant elliptical galaxies. While many methods exist, most require assumptions about the form of the underlying distribution function or data binning that leads to loss of information. With only line-of-sight (LOS) data, many methods suffer from the well-known mass-anisotropy degeneracy. To overcome these limitations, we develop a new, publicly available mass-modeling method, GravSphere2. This combines individual stellar velocities from LOS and proper motion (PM) measurements to solve the Jeans equations up to fourth order, without any data binning. Using flexible functional forms for the anisotropy profiles at second and fourth order, we show how including additional constraints from a new observable - fourth-order PMs - fully closes the system of equations, breaking the mass-anisotropy degeneracy at all orders. We test our method on mock data for dwarf galaxies, showing how GravSphere2 improves on previous methods. GravSphere2 recovers the mass density, stellar velocity anisotropy, and logarithmic slope of the mass density profile within its quoted 95% confidence intervals across almost all mocks over a wide radial range (0.1 < R/Rhalf < 10). We find GravSphere2 outperforms simple mass estimators, suggesting that it is worth using even when only a few LOS velocities are available. With 1,000 tracers without PMs, GravSphere2 recovers the logarithmic density slope at Rhalf with 12% (25%) statistical errors for cuspy (cored) mock data, enabling a distinction between the two. Including PMs, this improves to 8% (12%). With just 100 tracers and no PMs, we recover slopes with ~ 30% (20%) errors. GravSphere2 will be a valuable new tool to hunt for black holes and dark matter in spherical stellar systems, from globular clusters and dwarf galaxies to giant ellipticals and galaxy clusters.",

Unlike previous studies based on morphology or major axis alignment, we use spin as a direct, dynamically motivated probe. To match the limitations of observational data, the group spin, central-galaxy spin, and alignment angle are defined and measured in projection on the sky plane. By applying two novel spin estimators for galaxy groups, we find strong statistical evidence for a preferential alignment, with a mean projected angle of $34.17^\\circ \\pm 0.29^\\circ$, significantly deviating from random expectation at $37.77\\sigma$. This alignment signal persists across a wide range of group and galaxy properties, but its strength is modulated by mass, morphology, and color. Specifically, we find that more massive groups and more massive central galaxies exhibit stronger alignment. Furthermore, elliptical central galaxies show stronger alignment than spirals, and bluer central galaxies are more strongly aligned than redder ones. Our results suggest a close dynamical link between the spin of central galaxies and their host groups, modulated by their physical properties and star formation history. These results provide new insights into the dynamical connection between central galaxies and their host dark matter halos.",

The dynamical evolution of open clusters in the tidal field of the Milky Way and the feeding of the disc field star population depend strongly on the initial conditions at the time of gas removal. Detailed dynamical models tailored to individual clusters help us understand the role of open clusters in the Galactic disc evolution. Aims. We present a detailed dynamical model of Praesepe, which reproduces the mass profile, the stellar mass function, and the mass segregation observed with the help of Gaia EDR3 data. Based on this model, we investigate the kinematic properties of the tidal tail stars in detail. Methods. We used direct N-body simulations along the eccentric orbit of Praesepe in the tidal field of the Milky Way, where each particle represents one star. The initial mass and size of the cluster, the dynamical state, and the initial mass function were adapted to reach the best-fitting model. Based on this model and a comparison model on a circular orbit, we analysed the stars in the tidal tails in terms of density, angular momentum, and orbit shapes. Results. Praesepe can be well reproduced by a cluster model with concentrated star formation in a supervirial state after instantaneous gas expulsion, adopting a global star formation efficiency of 17%. About 75% of the initially 7500 MSol are lost in the violent relaxation phase, and the observed mass segregation can be understood by two-body relaxation. We find that the self-gravity of the tail stars is the dominant force altering the angular momentum of the tail stars. For a typical star, the total change after escaping is about 1.6 kpc km/s. This corresponds to an offset in guiding radius of 7 pc, where tail stars contribute up to 70% to the alteration. The total radial shift of the orbit of the cluster in the Galactic plane can exceed 50 pc. This effect is not a result of the eccentricity of the orbit.",

Grand, Francesca Fragkoudi 15 pages, 8 figures, submitted to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The powerful combination of Gaia with other Milky Way large survey data has ushered in a deeper understanding of the assembly history of our Galaxy, which is marked by the accretion of Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage (GES). As a step towards reconstructing this significant merger, we examine the existence and destruction of its stellar metallicity gradient. We investigate 8 GES-like progenitors from the Auriga simulations and find that all have negative metallicity gradients at infall with a range of -0.09 to -0.03 dex/kpc against radius and -1.99 to -0.41 dex/$\\rm 10^{-5} km^{2}s^{-2}$ against the stellar orbital energy. These gradients get blurred and become shallower when measured at $z=0$ in the Milky Way-like host. The percentage change in the radial metallicity gradient is consistently high (78-98\\%), while the percentage change in the energy space varies much more (9-91\\%). We also find that the most massive progenitors show the smallest changes in their energy metallicity gradients. At the same present-day galactocentric radius, lower metallicity stars originate from the outskirts of the GES progenitor. Similarly, at fixed metallicity, stars at higher galactocentric radii tend to originate from the GES outskirts. We find that the GES stellar mass, total mass, infall time, and the present-day Milky Way total mass are correlated with the percentage change in metallicity gradient, both in radius and in energy space. It is therefore vital to constrain these properties further to pin down the infall metallicity gradient of the GES progenitor and understand the onset of such ordered chemistry at cosmic noon.",

We identify 105 galaxy candidates within this range, spanning absolute ultraviolet (UV) magnitudes from M_UV~-18 to M_UV~-13 mag, about three magnitudes fainter, on average, than prior JWST studies. We place strong constraints on the ultra-faint end of the UV luminosity function (UVLF), finding minimal evolution in the faint-end slope, which varies from $\\alpha=-2.01\\pm0.20 at z=9 to \\alpha=-2.10\\pm0.19$ at z=13. This behaviour contrasts with the rapid evolution of the faint-end slope observed from z~0 to z~9. By integrating the UVLF down to M_UV=-16, we derive the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD)from z=9 to z=13, revealing a best-fit redshift evolution that follows $\\propto(1+z)^{-2.94^{+0.06}_{-0.10}}$. This slope is significantly shallower than predictions from most theoretical models. Extending the integration limit to M_UV=-13, we find that galaxies fainter than M_UV=-16 contribute more than 50% of the total cosmic SFR density at z~12. The observed excess in the cosmic SFRD at these high redshifts may suggest an enhancement in the star formation efficiency during the earliest phases of galaxy formation. Alternatively, this could result from other physical mechanisms, such as bursty star formation histories; minimal dust attenuation; or an evolving initial mass function. However, existing models that incorporate these scenarios fail to fully reproduce the observed redshift evolution of SFRD. Finally, we acknowledge the potential impact of low-redshift contamination and cosmic variance, as the small survey volume may not represent the broader galaxy population. Similar observations in different fields and spectroscopic confirmation are required to validate these findings",

Read, Walter Dehnen 21 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) It has long been thought that nuclear star clusters (NSCs) cannot co-exist with the most massive supermassive black holes (SMBHs), since SMBH mergers - unavoidable for the most massive systems - would scatter away NSC stars. However, central concentrations of light have now been reported in up to a third of all massive ellipticals. We present a new mechanism for forming NSCs in giant elliptical galaxies, arising naturally from SMBH mergers, which could explain these observations. We call this ''black hole dragging''. After a major merger of two galaxies and their SMBHs, the newly-merged SMBH can receive a gravitational wave recoil kick. We show that recoiling SMBHs induce two competing effects on the galaxy's background stars. Firstly, some stars become bound to the SMBH and co-move with it, an effect strongest at low recoil velocities. Secondly, background stars are ejected as the recoiling SMBH falls back due to dynamical friction, an effect strongest at high recoil velocities. At intermediate recoil velocities (500-1000 km/s), both effects become important, and the density of bound stars can exceed that of the background stellar core. This yields a central dense NSC that is clearly visible in the galaxy's surface brightness profile. We show that NSCs formed in this way have realistic sizes, masses and velocity dispersions when measured similarly to observed systems. This provides a route for even giant ellipticals containing SMBHs to host an NSC. We predict such NSCs should have indistinguishable colors, ages and chemistry from non-NSC central stars, combined with low ellipticities.",

We present a case study of the quasar J014741-030247 at $z \\sim$ 4.75, which hosts complex intrinsic absorption lines revealed by the high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectrum obtained from the HIERACHY program. We focus on one of the strongest absorption systems ($z$ $\\sim$ 4.7804) and determine the column densities of multiple ionization species. We find that the Apparent Optical Depth method may significantly underestimate the column densities of high ions. Decomposing the absorption into multiple components yields a better fit and reveals clear evidence of partial coverage. The variation in covering fractions among different ions suggests that high ions are distributed more extensively in this system. We estimate electron densities of different components ($630 - 4070 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$), these are based on the column densities of \\ion{Si}{2}* and \\ion{C}{2}*. By combining these with the hydrogen number density and ionization parameter derived from photoionization modeling, we infer that the different components are located at distances of 2.3 to 9.5 kpc from the quasar. The derived $N_{\\mathrm H} / n_{\\mathrm e}$ and the partial coverage observed in low ions all require cloud sizes smaller than 1 pc, even down to 0.01 pc. Finally, the low kinetic luminosity of the gas ($< 0.5\\% L_\\mathrm{bol}$) indicates that it is insufficient to drive significant AGN feedback and may only suppress star formation via `multistage' mechanism.",

Although the catalyzation on dust grain surfaces is considered as the dominant formation channel of H$_2$ in the interstellar medium (ISM), which could nonetheless suffer from the Boltzmann factor suppression at low temperatures. Here we demonstrate that quantum tunneling can dominate the H$_2$ formation process, effectively resolving the long-standing efficiency problem across a wide range of temperatures. By employing the path integral method in hybrid Monte Carlo simulations to account for nuclear quantum effects (NQEs), we quantitatively identify that the tunneling of hydrogen atoms maintains relatively stable efficiencies even at temperatures below 50 K on both graphitic and silicate grain surfaces. The potential barriers associated with chemisorption/desorption and two-H association, rather than diffusion and hopping, are the dominant factors governing the actual reaction efficiency at low temperatures. These findings provide a solid physical foundation for molecule formation, which historically relied on ad-hoc formation rate multipliers to explain observed rates. The quantitative rates also offer new methodologies for observational constraints on H$_2$ formation and destruction, thereby enabling more accurate astrophysical models and interpretations on interstellar molecular materials.",

However, due to a lack of interpretability and the associational nature of such models, it is difficult to understand how the information additional to integrated photometry (e.g., morphology) contributes to the estimation task. Improving our understanding in this field would enable further advances into unraveling the physical connections among galaxy properties and optimizing data exploitation. Therefore, our work is aimed at interpreting the deep learning-based estimation of stellar mass via two interpretability techniques: causal analysis and mutual information decomposition. The former reveals the causal paths between multiple variables beyond nondirectional statistical associations, while the latter quantifies the multicomponent contributions (i.e., redundant, unique, and synergistic) of different input data to the stellar mass estimation. Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we obtained meaningful results that provide physical interpretations for image-based models. Our work demonstrates the gains from combining deep learning with interpretability techniques, and holds promise in promoting more data-driven astrophysical research (e.g., astrophysical parameter estimations and investigations on complex multivariate physical processes).",

Submitted to AAS Journals Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The orbital eccentricity distribution of exoplanets is shaped by a combination of dynamical processes, reflecting both formation conditions and long-term evolution. Probing the orbital dynamics of planets in the kinematic thin and thick Galactic disks provides insight into the degree to which stellar and Galactic environmental factors affect planet formation and evolution pathways. The classification of host stars in Galactic kinematic terms constitutes a potentially useful axis for the interpretation of orbital eccentricity, when included together with stellar metallicity and age. Leveraging the photoeccentric effect, we constrain orbital eccentricities for the sample of Kepler planets and candidates orbiting F, G, K and M dwarf stars. With Gaia astrometry, inferred Galactic phase space information, and kinematic disk criteria calibrated on stellar chemical abundances, we probabilistically associate each planet host with the kinematic thin or thick Galactic disks. We then fit the underlying eccentricity distributions for the single- and multi-transit populations. We find that for single-transiting planets, kinematic thick disk planets exhibit higher eccentricities than thin disk planets, yet we find no such difference among multis. We determine that the difference in eccentricity is unlikely to be caused solely by the effects of host stellar metallicity or giant planet occurrence. We situate these findings in the context of known eccentricity relations, including its relationships with planet multiplicity, radius and metallicity. We suggest comprehensive analyses to disentangle these results from the effects of poorly understood star-planet relationships, such as that between stellar age and planetary orbital dynamics.",

Degl'Innocenti Accepted for publication in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate the feasibility of accurately determining the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio, $\\Delta Y/\\Delta Z$, from Gaia DR3 photometry for nearby low-mass main sequence field stars. We selected a sample of 2770 nearby MS stars from the Gaia DR3 catalogue, covering a Gaia $M_G$ absolute magnitude range of 6.0 to 6.8 mag. We computed a dense grid of isochrones, with $\\Delta Y/\\Delta Z$ varying from 0.4 to 3.2. These models were then used to fit the observations using the SCEPtER pipeline. The fitted values indicated that $\\Delta Y/\\Delta Z$ values of $1.5 \\pm 0.5$ were dequate for most stars. However, several clues suggested caution ought to be taken in interpreting this result. Chief among these concerns is the trend of decreasing $\\Delta Y/\\Delta Z$ with increasing $M_G$ magnitude, as well as the discrepancy between the red and blue parts of the observations. This result is further supported by our additional analysis of mock data, which were sampled and fitted from the same isochrone grid. In the mock data, no such trend emerged, while the uncertainty remained as large as 0.7. The robustness of our conclusions was confirmed by repeating the estimation using isochrones with Gaia magnitudes derived from different atmospheric models and by adopting a different stellar evolution code for stellar model computation. In both cases, the results changed drastically, clustering at $\\Delta Y/\\Delta Z \\approx 0.4$, which is at the lower end of the allowed values. Considering the current uncertainties affecting stellar model computations, it appears that adopting field stars for calibration is not a viable approach, even when adopting precise Gaia photometry.",

Accepted for publication in AJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Investigating the bubbles generated by the interaction between asymptotic giant branch stellar outflows and the interstellar medium (ISM) is pivotal for elucidating the mechanism by which evolved low- to intermediate-mass stars enrich the ISM with heavy elements. Using archival datasets from the Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot survey and the Galactic Arecibo L-Band Array \\ion{H}{1} survey, we have identified 14 bubbles within interstellar atomic hydrogen (\\ion{H}{1}) maps, each showing evidence of potential association with planetary nebulae (PNe).We pursue two primary objectives centered on the identified ISM bubbles and their association with PNe. First, leveraging the calibrated distance measurements of PNe from Gaia Data Release 3, we utilize these ISM bubbles as observational tracers to investigate and constrain the Galactic rotation curve. Second, we note that distance determinations for some PNe remain unreliable, partly because their central stars are obscured by extended nebular envelopes or are misidentified. Therefore, we develop a novel methodological framework to derive kinematic distances for PNe by leveraging the velocities of their associated ISM bubbles and constraints from the Galactic rotation curve.",

Testing a retrieval framework using simulated Kepler-like transit datasets Akshay Priyadarshi, Eamonn Kerins Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will unveil for the first time the full architecture of planetary systems across Galactic distances through the discovery of up to 200,000 cool and hot exoplanets using microlensing and transit detection methods. Roman's huge exoplanet haul, and Galactic reach, will require new methods to leverage the full exoplanet demographic content of the combined microlensing and transit samples, given the different sensitivity bias of the techniques to planet and host properties and Galactic location. We present a framework for technique-agnostic exoplanet demography (TAED) that can allow large, multi-technique exoplanet samples to be combined for demographic studies. Our TAED forward modelling and retrieval framework uses parameterised model exoplanet demographic distributions to embed planetary systems within a stellar population synthesis model of the Galaxy, enabling internally consistent forecasts to be made for all detection methods that are based on spatio-kinematic system properties. In this paper, as a first test of the TAED framework, we apply it to simulated transit datasets based on the Kepler Data Release 25 to assess parameter recovery accuracy and method scalability for a single large homogeneous dataset. We find that optimisation using differential evolution provides a computationally scalable framework that gives a good balance between computational efficiency and accuracy of parameter recovery.",

Klessen, Åke Nordlund, Andrius Popovas 16 pages, 13 figures, accepted by A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Understanding the origin and evolution of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars is key to tracing the Galaxy's early chemical enrichment. We investigate how realistic 3D radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) model atmospheres affect carbon abundances in CEMP stars and implications for their classification and Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). We focus on biases from traditional 1D hydrostatic models. We use the M3DIS code to compute 3D RHD model atmospheres for main-sequence and sub-giant stars over a wide range of metallicities and carbon enhancements. Synthetic spectra of the CH G-band are calculated with 3D radiative transfer and compared to spectra from classical 1D MARCS models. We derive abundance corrections and apply them to a large SAGA database sample to quantify effects on the carbon abundance distribution and CEMP classification. Our new 3D CEMP models predict cooler upper atmospheric layers than in 1D models, resulting in stronger CH absorption and lower inferred carbon abundances by up to -0.9 dex at the lowest metallicities. Carbon enhancement in the atmosphere itself increases molecular opacities and leads to radiative re-heating, partly offsetting adiabatic cooling in 3D models and reducing 3D-1D abundance corrections. Applying these corrections lowers the CEMP fraction by up to 20% below [Fe/H]=-3 and alters the relative contribution of CEMP sub-classes. The fraction of CEMP-no stars increases while the number of CEMP-r/s stars decreases, due to the downward revision of absolute carbon abundances. These changes bring the Galactic carbon distribution into better agreement with GCE models assuming a 20% contribution from faint supernovae. Realistic model atmospheres are essential to reliably reconstruct the Galaxy's early chemical enrichment history.",

These types of outbursts are explained by large changes in the mass accretion rate from the disk onto the central star. The outbursts support to a model of star formation (episodic accretion) where stars would spend most of their lifetimes accreting at low rates, and gain most of their mass through these short-lived accretion outbursts. The universality of episodic accretion, as well as its potential impact on stellar and planetary formation are still under debate. Improvement on the statistics of the members of the eruptive class is needed to better understand the episodic accretion phenomenon and its universality across different mass regimes and environments. In this paper we collect published information on the spectroscopic and photometric characteristics of 174 YSOs confirmed to belong to the eruptive variable class. We classify these objects into five different sub-classes (we find 49 FUor, 20 FUor-like, 16 EX Lupi-type, 81 Peculiar/V1647 Ori-like/MNors and 8 Periodic YSOs). The classification follows what has been done previously in the literature, and it is not an attempt to redefine these classes. In addition, we present a list of 18 embedded, and 6 massive YSOs, as additional categories of eruptive variable YSOs. Due to the complexity and/or faintness of these systems, it is hard to place them into the original classification scheme of this class of variable YSOs. Finally, we present a separate list of 355 candidate eruptive variable YSOs, which either lack spectroscopic information or the available spectroscopic data is not sufficient for an unambiguous classification. The online catalogue of confirmed and candidate eruptive YSOs will be maintained and updated in the future to serve as an important reference for the star formation community.",

Drout, Caitlin O'Brien Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Studies of the resolved stellar populations of young massive clusters have shown that the slope of the initial mass function appears to be the same everywhere, with no dependence on stellar density or metallicity. At the same time, studies of integrated properties of galaxies usually conclude that the IMF does vary, and must be top-heavy in starburst regions. In order to investigate this, we have carried out a long-term project to characterize the massive star content of NGC 3603, the nearest giant HII region, known to have a rich population of massive stars. We used both ground-based and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging to obtain photometry, and employed Gaia to establish membership. We obtained spectra of 128 stars using the Magellan 6.5~m telescope and HST, and combine these data to produce a reddening map. After analyzing the data in the same way as we have for 25 other star-forming regions in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds, we find that the IMF slope of NGC 3603 is quite normal compared to other clusters, with Gamma=-0.9+/-0.1. If anything, there are fewer very high mass (>65Mo) stars than one would expect by extrapolation from lower masses. This slope is also indistinguishable from what several studies have shown for R136 in the LMC, an even richer region. We speculate that the depreciation of the highest mass bins in NGC 3603, but not in R136, may indicate that it is harder to form extremely massive stars at the higher metallicity of the Milky Way compared to that of the LMC.",

Disks are selected based on kinematics and flattening from the VELA zoom-in hydro-cosmological simulations. The radial velocity fields in the disks are mapped, their averages are computed as a function of radius and over the whole disk, and the radial mass flux in each disk as a function of radius is obtained. The transport directly associated with fresh incoming streams is identified by selecting cold gas cells that are either on incoming streamlines or have low metallicity. The radial velocity fields in VELA disks are found to be highly non-axisymmetric, showing both inflows and outflows. However, in most cases, the average radial velocities, both as a function of radius and over the whole disk, are directed inwards, with the disk-averaged radial velocities typically amounting to a few percent of the disk-averaged rotational velocities. This is significantly lower than the expectations from various models that analytically predict the inward mass transport as driven by torques associated with disk instability. Under certain simplifying assumptions, the latter typically predict average inflows of more than $10\\%$ of the rotational velocities. Analyzing the radial motions of streams and off-stream material, we find that the radial inflow in VELA disks is dominated by the stream inflows themselves, especially in the outer disks. The high inward radial velocities inferred in observed disks at cosmic noon, at the level of $\\sim \\! 20\\%$ of the rotational velocities, may reflect inflowing streams from the cosmic web rather than being generated by disk instability.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate broad emission-line wings, reaching $\\leq 800\\rm~km~s^{-1}$, observed in 26 galaxies with Lyman continuum (LyC) observations, primarily from the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS). Using Magellan/MIKE, VLT/X-shooter, and WHT/ISIS high-resolution spectroscopy, we show that this fast gas appears to probe the dominant feedback mechanisms linked to LyC escape. We find that in 14 galaxies, the wings are best fit with power laws of slope $\\alpha \\sim -3.5 \\text{ to } -1.6$, with four others best fit by Gaussians of width $\\sigma_{\\rm BW} \\sim 300~\\rm km~s^{-1}$; the remaining eight show ambiguous wing morphologies. Gaussian wings are found only at low $O_{32}$ = $[\\rm O~III]\\lambda5007/[O~II]\\lambda3726,3729$ and high metallicity, while power-law wings span the full range of these parameters. The general evidence suggests a dual-mode paradigm for LyC escape: radiation-driven superwinds traced by power-law wings and supernova-driven feedback traced by Gaussian wings. For the former, the $<3$ Myr-old, pre-supernova stellar population correlates with more luminous, faster winds. The data also show that radiation-driven wind parameters like wind luminosity and power-law slope $\\alpha$ depend on the UV luminosity more than the optically thick covering fraction, consistent with ``picket-fence\" radiative transfer. Observed $\\alpha$ values flatten with both escaping LyC luminosity and higher extinction, while still preserving the anticorrelation between these two quantities. Additionally, the differential between red and blue slopes implies that extinction and dense gas are centrally concentrated relative to the wind emission. Overall, our results show that power-law emission-line wings probe LyC-driven winds and LyC escape in metal-poor starbursts.",

Ratzenböck Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Recent measurements of cosmogenic $^{10}$Be in deep-ocean ferromanganese crusts from the Central and Northern Pacific have revealed an anomalous concentration between 11.5 and 9.0 Myr ago, peaking at 10.1 Myr. One possible explanation is a nearby supernova (SN) event. Motivated by this and by the proximity of the Solar System to the Orion star-forming region during that period, we estimate the probability that at least one SN occurred between the onset and peak of the anomaly. Using an open cluster catalog based on Gaia DR3, we trace back the orbits of 2725 clusters and the Sun over the past 20 Myr and compute the expected number of SN events. We find 19 clusters with a probability greater than 1% each of producing at least one SN within 100 pc of the Sun in the time interval 11.5-10.1 Myr ago. The total cumulative probability exceeds zero at 35 pc from the Sun and increases rapidly with distance, reaching 68% near 100 pc. Two young clusters dominate the SN probability: ASCC 20 contributes most within 70 pc, while OCSN 61 becomes more significant beyond that distance. Our results support the plausibility of a SN origin for the $^{10}$Be anomaly and highlight the importance of additional $^{10}$Be records from independent terrestrial archives to determine whether the anomaly is of astrophysical or terrestrial origin.",

      "abstract": "Insights for Early Massive Black Hole Growth from JWST Detection of the [Ne v] λ3427 Emission Line Benny Trakhtenbrot, Claudio Ricci, Ezequiel Treister, Michael J. Koss, Richard Mushotzky, Kyuseok Oh, Alessandro Peca, Franz E. Bauer, Kriti Kamal Gupta, Tomer Reiss Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We use the narrow [Ne v] $\\lambda$3427 emission line detected in the recently published JWST spectra of two galaxies, at z = 6.9 and 5.6, to study the key properties of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in their centers. Using a new empirical scaling linking the [Ne v] line emission with AGN accretion-driven (continuum) emission, derived from a highly complete low-redshift AGN sample, we show that the [Ne v] emission in the two z > 5 galaxies implies total (bolometric) AGN luminosities of order L_bol~(4-8)x10^45 erg/s. Assuming that the radiation emitted from these systems is Eddington limited, the (minimal) black hole masses are of order M_BH>10^7 M_sun. Combined with the published stellar masses of the galaxies, estimated from dedicated fitting of their spectral energy distributions, the implied BH-to-stellar mass ratios are of order M_BH/M_host~0.1-1. This is considerably higher than what is found in the local Universe, but is consistent with the general trend seen in some other z > 5 AGN. Given the intrinsic weakness of the [Ne v] line and the nature of the [Ne v]-to-L_bol scaling, any (rare) detection of the [Ne v] $\\lambda$3427 line at z > 5 would translate to similarly high AGN luminosities and SMBH masses, thus providing a unique observational path for studying luminous AGN well into the epoch of reionization, including obscured sources.",

Grand, HanYuan Zhāng 17 pages, 8 figures, published in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Understanding the Milky Way disc formation requires characterising its structural and kinematic properties as functions of stellar age. Using red giant stars from APOGEE DR17 and Gaia DR3, we model the age-dependent stellar kinematics with a quasi-isothermal distribution function and fit disc parameters as a function of age using non-parametric splines. We identify a transition from thick to thin disc populations around 10 Gyr ago. Stars older than this have short scale lengths ($\\sim$1.7 kpc), typical of the thick disc, while younger stars exhibit increasing scale length with decreasing age, consistent with inside-out formation of the thin disc. This transition possibly coincides with the end of the starburst triggered by the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger. Stars formed around 10 Gyr ago exhibit a dip in scale length, even shorter than that of the thick disc. Comparison with an Auriga simulation suggests that this scale-length dip reflects gas disc shrinking caused by the transition from a cold to hot gas accretion mode. We propose the following disc formation scenario: (1) the thick disc formed under cold-mode accretion; (2) the GSE merger triggered a starburst and increased the total mass of the Galaxy, causing the transition to hot-mode accretion; (3) rapid gas consumption led to temporary shrinking of the star-forming gas disc; and then (4) thin disc grows in an inside-out fashion, as the size of the star-forming gas disc grows via hot-mode smooth gas accretion.",

Palumbo, Alexey Potapov, Maisie Rashman, Sascha Zeegers 28 pages, 7 figures, accepted by ApJ; one typo corrected; two minor clarifying changes to text Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Infrared spectra of hydrocarbon dust absorption bands toward the bright hypergiant Cygnus OB2-12 are compared to published spectra of the Quintuplet Cluster, a sightline to the Galactic center. The Cyg OB2-12 data include a new ground-based 2.86-3.70 microns spectrum and a previously published, but here further analyzed, spectrum of the 5.50-7.34 microns region. Higher spectral resolution data for the Cyg OB2-12 sightline in the 3 micron region allows a detailed comparison of the 3.4 micron aliphatic bands to those observed toward the Quintuplet. Despite differences in interstellar environments along each sightline, strong similarities are observed in the central wavelengths and relative strengths for bands at 3.3, 3.4, 5.85, 6.2, and 6.85 microns. Analysis of these bands, produced by aromatic, aliphatic, olefinic, hydrogenated, and oxygenated components, shows that carbonaceous dust is a significant component of the diffuse interstellar medium, second in abundance only to silicates, and is primarily aromatic in nature. The grains producing these bands likely consist of large aromatic carbon cores with thin aliphatic mantles composed of hydrogenated amorphous carbon (HAC). Laboratory analog spectra reproduce the observed aliphatic absorption bands well, supporting the presence of such mantles. We present evidence that the carriers of both the 3.4 micron aliphatic and the 3.3 micron aromatic bands reside exclusively in the diffuse ISM, and that the 3.3 micron bands observed in the diffuse ISM differ from the 3.25 micron band seen in dense clouds, implying chemically distinct carriers.",

Improving moment-based thermal models of circumstellar disks David Melon Fuksman, Mario Flock, Hubert Klahr, Giancarlo Mattia, Dhruv Muley Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Common moment-based radiative transfer methods, such as flux-limited diffusion (FLD) and the M1 closure, suffer from artificial interactions between crossing beams. In protoplanetary disks, this leads to an overestimation of the midplane temperature due to the merging of inward and outward vertical fluxes. Methods that avoid these artifacts typically require angular discretization, which can be computationally expensive. In the spirit of the two-stream approximation, we introduced a half-moment (HM) closure that integrates the radiative intensity over hemispheres, thereby suppressing beam interactions along a fixed spatial direction. We derived a multidimensional HM closure via entropy maximization and replaced this closure with an approximate expression that closely matches it, coinciding with it in the diffusion and free-streaming regimes while remaining expressible through simple operations. We implemented HM and M1 closures via implicit-explicit schemes, including multiple frequency groups. We tested these methods in numerical benchmarks such as computing the temperature in an irradiated disk around a T Tauri star, comparing our results with Monte Carlo (MC) radiative transfer simulations. The HM closure correctly reproduces the diffusion limit and prevents crossing flux interactions in a chosen spatial direction. In disk simulations, our multigroup HM method closely matches midplane temperature distributions obtained with classical MC methods. While the M1 closure produces midplane temperatures 44% higher than MC with one frequency group and 21% higher with 22 groups, HM reduces this discrepancy to 6% with 22 groups. Even with just three groups, HM significantly outperforms M1, with maximum departures of 8% compared to M1's 23%. Our results show that combining HM with a multigroup treatment yields more realistic disk temperatures than M1, particularly in optically thick regions.",

Their high-$q$ orbits are detached from the influence of the four giant planets and need extra perturbation to form. One hypothesis posits that close stellar flybys could have perturbed objects from the primordial scattering disk, generating the sednoid population. In this study, we run N-body simulations with different stellar encounter configurations to explore whether such a close stellar flyby can satisfy new constraints identified from sednoid (and detached extreme TNO) observation, including the low-inclination ($i<30^\\circ$) profile and primordial orbital alignment. Our results suggest that flybys with field stars are unable to generate a sufficient population, whereas flybys within the birth cluster fail to produce the primordial orbital alignment. To meet the inclination constraint of detached extreme TNOs, flybys have to be either coplanar ($i_\\star \\sim 0^\\circ$) or symmetric about the ecliptic plane ($\\omega_\\star \\sim 0^\\circ, i_\\star \\sim 90^\\circ$). After taking into account their occurrence rate at the early stage of the Solar System, we conclude that close-in stellar flybys ($q_\\star \\le 1000$~au) that satisfy all constraints are unlikely to happen ($\\lesssim$5\\%). Future discoveries of additional sednoids with precise orbital determinations are crucial to confirm the existence of the low-inclination tendency and the primordial alignment, and to further constrain the early dynamical evolution of the Solar System.",

While this is established since decades for the contribution of quasars to the diffuse emission above 1 keV energies, the possible contribution of undetected stars in the Milky Way to the softer band (0.5-1 keV) background emission is still poorly constrained. The overall unresolved X-ray flux from the stars is the product between the stellar spatial distribution in the Milky Way and the underlying X-ray luminosity function (XLF). In this work, we build the XLF of the stars and study its structure with respect to a set of main-sequence spectral types (F, G, K, M) and evolutionary stages (giants and white dwarfs). We build the XLF in volume-limited subsamples of increasing maximum distance and corresponding minimum X-ray luminosity using the HamStar catalog of X-ray emitting stars detected in the Western Galactic hemisphere with the extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) space observatory. We build an extinction-corrected Gaia color-magnitude diagram and decompose the XLF into the relative contribution of different groups of stars. We provide an empirical polynomial description of the XLF for the total sample and for the different stellar subgroups that can be used to estimate the unresolved contribution from the stars to the soft X-ray background of the Milky Way in a flux-limited survey.",

Ejecta from $r$-process enrichment events like kilonovae are difficult to directly measure, so we must instead probe abundances in metal-poor stars to constrain $r$-process models. This requires state-of-the-art Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) modeling, as LTE is a poor approximation for the low-opacity atmospheres of metal-poor giants. Neodymium (Nd) is a prominent $r$-process element detected in both near-infrared kilonovae spectra and spectra of metal-poor stars, so precise Nd stellar abundances are particularly needed to model kilonovae and constrain $r$-process sites. We thus constructed a Nd I / Nd II model atom to compute NLTE abundances in FGK metal-poor stars. We obtain $\\mathrm{A(Nd)}_\\odot = 1.44\\pm0.05$, in agreement with the meteoritic value, when calibrating the model atom with a Drawin hydrogen collision factor of $S_H=0.1$. For a sample of metal-poor $r$-process enhanced stars with observed optical and near-infrared Nd II lines, we find NLTE Nd corrections in the range $-0.3$ to $0.3$ dex. Optical and UV lines have positive NLTE corrections, whereas H band lines have negative corrections. Additionally, we compute a large grid of NLTE corrections for 122 Nd II spectral lines ranging from the UV to the H band, for stellar parameters of typical metal-poor FGK dwarfs and giants with $-3.00\\le\\mbox{[Fe/H]}\\le-1.00$ and $-2.0\\le\\mathrm{A(Nd)}\\le2.0$. Within this grid, we find NLTE corrections ranging from $-0.3$ to $+0.5$ dex. Deviations from LTE are found to be strongest for blue lines with low excitation potentials in the most metal-poor giants.",

This new model integrates two well established models, Newtonian CAFE (MHD) and PakalMPI (NLTE), through a self-convergence system that links the state equations used by both codes to calculate density, pressure and temperature, with the mean molecular weight ($\\mu$) serving as a proxy. Newtonian CAFE computes the plasma variables using the ideal MHD while PakalMPI calculates the species densities of neutral Hydrogen (HI), protons (HII), negative Hydrogen (H-), and electrons (ne) under the NLTE approximation. We used Tonalli to test the stability of the hydrostatic C7 model, covering 3000 km of the solar chromosphere with a vertical constant field of 30 Gauss and a vertical constant gravity field of 274.0 ms-2. As a result, Tonalli generates 3D cubes of densities, temperature, pressure, mean molecular weight, and the departure coefficient of Hydrogen in its first energy level b1, providing a detailed representation of the ionization states of the plasma at chromosphere altitudes. Despite the fact that MHD conditions can lead to numerical diffusion of the plasma, we demonstrate robustness and consistency, and self-convergence of the model with the relative error of electron density reaching values of $3.7x10^{-7}$.",

(Comments are welcome) Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We report the discovery of fullerene in the circumstellar environment of WRAY~16-232, a strong candidate luminous blue variable. Multiple pointings of archival \\textit{Spitzer} IRS spectra reveal, for the first time, the presence of prominent vibrational bands of C$_{60}$ at 17.4 and 18.9~$\\mu$m in an LBV envelope, along with the strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon features. These observations suggest that, despite the harsh radiative conditions, large carbonaceous molecules can form, process and survive in the ejecta of massive stars. Complementary optical spectroscopy with SALT HRS shows multiple P\\,Cygni profiles in H$\\alpha$, He\\,\\textsc{i}, and Fe\\,\\textsc{ii} lines, which are indicative of a dense, expanding wind and substantial mass loss. Furthermore, analysis of decade long photometric data shows short-term brightness variations of $\\sim$ 0.5~mag. These results not only reinforce the classification of WRAY~16-232 as a strong LBV candidate but also provide new insights into the mechanisms of dust formation and the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium by massive stars. We discuss various scenarios for fullerene formation in such environments, and find that shock processing due to wind-wind interactions could be playing a vital this http URL shell of WRAY~16-232 has an ideal UV field strength and the time scales appears to match with shock processing timescales. The results highlight the need for further high spatial/spectral resolution and temporal observations to confirm the formation and survival scenario of C$_{60}$ in its shell.",

The system is found to be an extreme low mass ratio system (q = 0.197) with high inclination (i = 84.5 deg), moderate degree of contact (27%) and near equal temperatures of the components. Period analysis of survey photometry spanning over 6300 days reveals no significant change. Although the system does not demonstrate a significant O'Connell effect there are a number of other markers strongly suggesting the system is chromospherically active. Orbital analysis indicates that the system is stable and not a merger candidate.",

Rice 15 pages, 7 figures Manuscript Ready for Publication in ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Three-dimensional magnetic reconnection is a fundamental plasma process crucial for heating the solar corona and generating the solar wind, but resolving and characterizing it on the Sun remains challenging. Using high-quality data from the Chinese New Vacuum Solar Telescope, the Solar Dynamics Observatory, and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, this work presents highly suggestive direct imaging evidence of magnetic reconnection during the untangling of braided magnetic structures above a sunspot. These magnetic structures, visible as bright superpenumbral threads in extreme ultraviolet passbands, initially bridge opposite-polarity magnetic fluxes and then gradually tangle in their middle section. Magnetic extrapolation reveals the fibrils to form a small flux rope that is twisted and braided, possibly created by persistent and complex photospheric motions. During untangling, repetitive reconnection events occur inside the flux rope, accompanied by transient plasma heating, bidirectional outflowing blobs, and signatures of nanojets. Emission analysis reveals that the outflowing blobs are multi-thermal structures with temperatures well below 1 MK, undergoing rapid cooling and leaving emission imprints in H{\\alpha} images. The measured reconnection angles indicate that 16%-22% of the magnetic field along each thread is anti-parallel, with the remaining field acting as a guide field. The estimated energy released during these reconnection events is comparable to nanoflares, which can be powered by up to 6% of the magnetic energy stored in the anti-parallel field. This work presents a textbook example of magnetic flux rope reconnection in the solar atmosphere, providing new insights into fine-scale energy release processes within sunspot superpenumbral fibrils.",

Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Accurately modeling the solar magnetic field is important for understanding long-term solar activity and space weather, but it is challenging due to limited observations, especially near the poles. The Surface Flux Transport (SFT) model simulates how magnetic flux moves across the solar surface and contributes to the polar field, but it parametrizes emerged sunspots as simple symmetric bipolar regions and needs improvement by including more realistic sunspot features. In this study, we reconstruct the century-long evolution of the solar magnetic field, including the polar regions, using an improved SFT model. We incorporate cycle-dependent morphological asymmetry between leading and following sunspots, along with observationally derived tilt angles and sunspot area data for a century (1913-2016), to better represent magnetic flux transport and investigate the impact of asymmetry on polar field development. To study morphological asymmetry, we consider two cases: first, a long-term asymmetry factor calculated from the ratio of leading and following sunspot areas spanning over a century; second, the temporal asymmetry factor observed during solar cycle 23 applied to every solar cycle. Our simulated magnetic flux transport with inclusion of morphological asymmetry for both cases gets improved compared to the no asymmetry case in terms of enhanced low and mid-latitude magnetic flux and matches closely with observations. The simulated polar fields with asymmetry also show a better agreement with polar field observations for most cycles, particularly in capturing the timing of the polar field reversals and the peak amplitude during solar minima, which has severe consequences in solar cycle prediction",

Under review in ApJL. Comments are welcome Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Space-weather and disturbances in the heliosphere are manifestations of the solar magnetic field, which is solely driven by the interior dynamo, and constraining the solar interior magnetic field and its oscillatory behavior is one of the major challenges in solar physics. Observationally, none of the techniques, including helioseismology, are able to provide an estimation of the interior magnetic field. We reconstruct, for the first time, the dynamics of the interior large-scale magnetic fields by assimilating observed line-of-sight photospheric magnetogram data from MDI/SOHO & HMI/SDO along with helioseismic differential rotation data for three decades (1996-2025) into a 3D dynamo model. Our data-driven model successfully reproduces key observational features such as the surface butterfly diagram, polar field evolution, and axial dipole moment. The reconstructed interior field dominated by toroidal component exhibits an equatorward migration and reproduces the realistic amplitude and modulation of cycles 23-25. The non-axisymmetric behaviour of the interior toroidal field becomes less prominent as we move deep towards the tachocline. A strong correlation between the simulated toroidal field and sunspot number/area establishes our 3D magnetogram-driven model as a robust predictive model of the solar cycle.",

They frequently display systematic asymmetric and anti-correlated spatial variations of their particle density and temperature across the current sheet, leaving the plasma pressure essentially uniform. These observations of asymmetries have previously been modelled theoretically by adding additional terms to both the ion and electron distribution functions of self-consistent force-free collisionless current sheet models with constant density and temperature profiles. In this paper we present the results of a modification of these models in which only the electron distribution function has a term added to it, whereas the ion distribution function is kept as a thermal (Maxwellian) distribution function. In this case the nonlinear quasineutrality condition no longer has a simple analytical solution and therefore has to be solved alongside Ampère's law. We find that while the magnetic field remains approximately force-free, the non-zero quasineutral electric field gives rise to an additional spatial substructure of the plasma density inside the current sheet. We briefly discuss the potential relation between our theoretical findings and current sheet observations.",

Recent computational advances, at the level of both algorithmics and hardware, have enabled high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations to span multiple scales, offering new insights into magnetic energy dissipation processes. Here, we study scale invariance of magnetic energy dissipation in two distinct MHD simulations. Current sheets are identified and analyzed over time. Results demonstrate that dissipative events exhibit scale invariance, with power-law distributions characterizing their energy dissipation and lifetimes. Remarkably, these distributions are consistent across the two simulations, despite differing numerical and physical setups, suggesting universality in the process of magnetic energy dissipation. Comparisons between the evolution of dissipation regions reveals distinct growth behaviors in high plasma-beta regions (convective zone) and low plasma-beta regions (atmosphere). The latter display spatiotemporal dynamics similar to those of avalanche models, suggesting self-organized criticality and a common universality class.",

Skarka submitted to A&A, comments welcome Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The majority of massive stars are part of binary systems that may interact during their evolution. This has important consequences for systems in which one star develops into a Red supergiant (RSG); however, not many RSGs are known binaries. We aim to better constrain the properties of some of the known RSGs in binaries. We first focus on the VV Cephei type RSG KQ Pup (RSG+B-type companion, orbital period of 26 yr), where we have enough data to constrain the system's properties. We use archival photometry and UV spectroscopy, along with newly taken optical spectra and interferometric data. For KQ Pup, as well as for all other Galactic RSGs, we also analyzed the available TESS data. Using TESS photometry, we discovered eclipses with a period of $17.2596 \\: \\rm d$, associated with the hot B companion, making it a Ba+Bb pair. Meanwhile, the detection of the hydrogen Br$\\gamma$ line with VLTI-GRAVITY enabled us to track the orbital motion of the KQ Pup Ba+Bb pair and thus to determine the astrometric orbit. The dynamical masses agree with independent estimates from asteroseismology and evolutionary models. The results give a mass of $ \\sim 9 \\: \\rm M_{\\odot} $ for the RSG and $ \\sim 14 \\: \\rm M_{\\odot} $ for the sum of the hot components Ba+Bb. The observed properties of the system are compatible with a coeval hierarchical triple-star, where we constrain the minimum mass of KQ Pup Bb as $ \\gtrsim 1.2 \\: \\rm M_{\\odot} $. The variability of Balmer lines and the detection of Br$\\gamma$ represent a strong signature of Wind Roche Lobe Overflow, with enhanced signatures of disk-accretion to the Ba+Bb pair during the periastron. Meanwhile, TESS light curves show that about $\\sim 10 \\%$ of known Galactic binary RSGs may be eclipsing hierarchical triple systems, which suggests that a large fraction of other binary RSGs could also be triples.",

It is a member of a class of very low-mass companions at distances of hundreds to thousands of AU from their host stars. We aim to constrain Ross 458c's formation history by fitting its near-IR spectrum to models to constrain its composition. If its composition is similar to its host star, we infer that it likely formed through turbulent fragmentation of the same molecular cloud that formed the host. If its composition is enhanced in heavy elements relative to the host, this lends evidence to formation in the disk and subsequent migration to its current separation. Here, we present high-resolution (R$\\sim$2700) emission spectra of Ross 458c with JWST NIRSpec Fixed Slit in the F070LP, F100LP, and F170LP filters from 0.8 to 3.1 $\\mu$m.

In either case, the extent to which a planet can preserve its atmosphere critically depends on poorly understood planetary magnetism. An effective probe of planetary magnetic fields is the interaction between a star and its close-in planet, where the planet magnetically interacts with its host, inducing flares as it moves near its periastron within the Alfvén surface of its host star. We construct a pipeline, \\textsc{ardor}, to detect and characterize potentially planet-induced flares in time-series photometric data using a physically motivated forward model of star-planet interactions, with a focus on recovering flares located near the noise floor. We perform extensive injection-recovery simulations to determine our sensitivity to flares correlating with the planetary phase over a range of stellar types and orbital architectures.

Because of this, dust pebbles with an irregular shape usually align mechanically and thus cause polarization signatures in their thermal radiation due to dichroic emission or absorption. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the potential to trace the impact of mechanical grain alignment in protoplanetary disks on the observed degree and orientation of linear polarization at millimeter wavelengths. We combined 3D radiation hydrodynamical simulations to determine the density distribution and the velocity field of gas and dust particles, Monte Carlo dust-gas interaction simulations to calculate the mechanical alignment of dust in a gas flow, and, finally, 3D Monte Carlo polarized radiative transfer simulations to obtain synthetic polarimetric observations. We find that large grains, which contribute the most to the net polarization, are potentially mechanically aligned in the protoplanetary disk under the effect of the vertical shear instability (VSI). Thereby, the drift velocity is parallel to the rotational disk axis. Assuming oblate dust grains that are aligned with their short axis parallel to the direction of the drift velocity, the resulting polarization is usually along the major axis of the disk. This is in contrast to typical drift models that propose either a radial or azimuthal drift velocity component. If hydrodynamical instabilities, such as the VSI, dominate the kinematics in protoplanetary disks, the mechanical alignment of dust is a promising mechanism for grain alignment in these systems. In that case, the resulting millimeter polarization allows us to trace the orientation of aligned millimeter-sized grains.",

Eclipsing binaries are useful for many aspects of stellar astrophysics, including calibrating stellar models, and catalogs of eclipsing binary properties provide context for population-level inferences. In this work, we present our selection criteria for our catalog, along with steps taken to characterize the orbital and physical properties of our EBs. We further detail crucial steps in vetting our catalog to ensure that the systems in our catalog have a high likelihood of being true M&Ms. Our sample consists primarily of binaries with short-period, circular orbits and often manifest as high-mass ratio \"twin\" M&Ms. We find that our sample of M&Ms does not exhibit the same excess of contact binaries that similar samples of solar-type binaries do. Using a novel statistical approach, we find a tidal circularization period of approximately 2.0 days for these binaries, which is significantly shorter than the value typically given in the literature of 7 days. Finally, we explore the prospects for additional companions to our M&Ms. Future avenues include spectroscopic follow-up of bright M&Ms to better-characterize low-mass stellar properties and a deeper assessment of the presence of tertiary companions.",

This work demonstrates the technical readiness of MeerKAT for solar observations at the boresight of the telescope in the UHF (580-1015 MHz) and L-band (900-1670 MHz) frequency ranges, including optimized modes, a dedicated calibration scheme, and a tailored, entirely automated calibration and imaging pipeline. The quality of solar images is validated through morphological comparisons with the solar images at other wavelengths. Several unique early science results showcase the potential of this new capability of MeerKAT. Once fully commissioned and operational, this will unlock novel solar studies, significantly expand the scientific portfolio of MeerKAT, and lay the groundwork for solar observations with the mid-frequency telescope of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory, for which MeerKAT serves as a precursor.",

Takács 21 pages, 20 figures, accepted for publication in the A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Accretion variability is ubiquitous in YSOs. While large outbursts may strongly affect the disk, the effects of moderate bursts are less understood. We aim to study the physical response of the disk around the eccentric binary system DQ Tau to its periodic accretion changes. We organized a multi-wavelength campaign centered on four JWST/MIRI spectra. We targeted three periastrons (high accretion state) and one apastron (quiescence). We used optical and near-infrared spectroscopy and photometry to measure how the accretion luminosity varies. We decomposed the multi-epoch SEDs into stellar, accretion, and rim components. We fitted the solid-state features using various opacity curves and the molecular features using slab models. We find the inner disk of DQ Tau to be highly dynamic. The temperature, luminosity, and location of the inner dust rim vary in response to the movement of stars and the L_acc variations. This causes variable shadowing of the outer disk, leading to an anti-correlation between the rim temperature and the strength of the silicate feature. The dust mineralogy remains constant, dominated by large amorphous olivine and pyroxene grains, with smaller fractions of crystalline forsterite. The excitation of CO (1550-2260 K), HCN (880-980 K), and hot H2O (740-860 K) molecules as well as the luminosity of the [NeII] line correlate with the accretion rate, while the warm (650 K) and cold (170-200 K) H2O components are mostly constant. CO emission, originating from a hot (>1500 K) region likely within the dust sublimation radius, is most sensitive to L_acc changes. In comparison with other T Tauri disks, DQ Tau is highly C-poor and displays moderately inefficient pebble drift. We conclude that even moderate accretion rate changes affect the thermal structure in the planet-forming disk regions on short timescales, providing a crucial benchmark for understanding disk evolution.",

Understanding their early dynamics remains challenging due to observational limitations in the low corona. We present a statistical evaluation of the DIRECD (Dimming InfeRred Estimation of CME Direction) method, which provides a novel approach to determining initial CME propagation directions using coronal dimmings. We analyze 33 coronal dimming events well observed by SDO/AIA and validate our DIRECD results with 3D reconstructions from the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model. We find generally good agreement between the DIRECD-derived inclinations and the GCS model. In the meridional plane (north--south direction), the mean difference in inclinations is $0.3^\\circ \\pm 7.8^\\circ$. In the equatorial plane (east--west direction), the mean difference is $-2.9^\\circ \\pm 18.9^\\circ$. In 3D, the inclinations show a mean difference of $1.2^\\circ \\pm 10.4^\\circ$. We further visually compare our method by projecting the DIRECD cones onto LASCO/C2 observations, and verify the model's ability to capture both the primary CME structure and associated secondary dimming regions. This work establishes DIRECD as a powerful, observationally grounded technique for determining the initial CME direction, offering new insights that complement existing reconstruction methods. The technique's unique capability to determine early CME direction in the low corona using coronal dimmings observed in EUV images makes it particularly valuable for improving space weather forecasting models.",

Fang, Á. Kóspál, G. Lodato, K. Mauco, Ł. Tychoniec Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The accretion luminosity (Lacc) in young, low-mass stars is crucial for understanding stellar formation, but direct measurements are often hindered by limited spectral coverage and challenges in UV-excess modeling. Empirical relations linking Lacc to various accretion tracers are widely used to overcome these limitations. This work revisits these empirical relations using the PENELLOPE dataset, evaluating their applicability across different star-forming regions and to accreting young objects other than Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs). We analyzed the PENELLOPE VLT/X-Shooter dataset of 64 CTTSs, measuring fluxes of several accretion tracers and adopting the stellar and accretion parameters derived from PENELLOPE works. We supplemented our analysis with the ODYSSEUS HST data set, which covers a wider spectral range in NUV bands. We compared the Lacc values obtained in the PENELLOPE and ODYSSEUS surveys finding statistically consistent results. Our analysis confirms that existing empirical relations, previously derived for the Lupus sample, provide reliable Lacc estimates for CTTSs in several other star-forming regions. We revisit empirical relations for accretion tracers in our dataset, based on HST-fit, with coefficients which are consistent within 1sigma with XS-fit results for most lines. We also propose a method to estimate extinction using these relations and investigate the empirical relations for Brackett lines (Br8 to Br21). The Lacc vs Lline empirical relations can be successfully used for statistical studies of accretion on young forming objects in different star-forming regions. These relations also offer a promising approach to independently estimate extinction in CTTSs. We confirm that near-infrared lines (PaB and BrG) reliably trace Lacc in high accretors, making them valuable tools for probing accretion properties of high accreting young stars not accessible in the UVB.",

Comments invited Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Applying a principle of \"radical mundanity\", this paper examines explanations for the lack of strong evidence for the presence of technology-using extraterrestrial civilizations (ETCs) in the Galaxy - the Fermi paradox. With this principle, the prospect that the Galaxy contains a modest number of civilizations is preferred, where none have achieved technology levels sufficient to accomplish large-scale astro-engineering or lack the desire to do so. This consideration also leads to the expectation that no ETC will colonize a large fraction of the Galaxy, even using robotic probes, and that there are no long-duration high-power beacons. However, there is a reasonable chance that we may make contact on a short, by historical standards, timescale. This event would be momentous, but could still leave us slightly disappointed. Such a Universe would be less terrifying than either of the two possibilities in the quote generally attributed to Arthur C. Clarke on whether we are alone or not. Also, if there is a modest number of ETCs in the Galaxy, that would suggest that there is a large number of planets with some form of life.",

This paper challenges that paradigm, arguing that highly advanced, potentially post-biological civilisations may undergo rapid technological acceleration, quickly progressing beyond recognisable or detectable phases. We introduce a simple model showing that the technological acceleration rate of such civilisations can compress their detectable phase to mere decades, dramatically narrowing the temporal \"detection window\" in which their technosignatures overlap with our current capabilities. This framework offers a plausible resolution to the \"Great Silence\": advanced civilisations may be abundant and long-lived, but effectively invisible to present-day SETI methods. Consequently, our efforts must include but also evolve beyond the search for narrow-band communication signals in the radio and optical domains. Instead, we require an expanded, technology-agnostic strategy focused on persistent, large-scale manifestations of intelligence, such as broadband electromagnetic leakage, waste heat from megastructures, and multi-dimensional anomaly detection across extensive, multi-wavelength and multi-messenger datasets. Leveraging advanced artificial intelligence for unsupervised anomaly discovery, recursive algorithm optimisation, and predictive modelling will be essential to uncover the subtle, non-anthropocentric traces of advanced civilisations whose technosignatures lie beyond our current technological and cognitive frameworks.",

Mod-Cam, a first-light instrument for FYST, serves as a testbed for instrument module characterization, including detailed evaluation of thermal behavior under operating conditions prior to deploying modules in the larger Prime-Cam instrument. Prime-Cam is a first generation multi-band, wide-field camera for FYST, designed to field up to seven instrument modules and provide unprecedented sensitivity across a broad frequency range. We present results from two key laboratory characterizations: an \"optically open\" cooldown to validate the overall thermal performance of the cryostat, and a \"cold load\" cooldown to measure the effect of focal plane temperature stability on detector noise. During the optically open test, we achieved stable base temperatures of 1.5 K on the 1 K stage and 85 mK at the detector stage. In the cold load configuration, we measured a detector focal plane RMS temperature stability of 3.2e-5 K. From this stability measurement, we demonstrate that the equivalent power from focal plane thermal fluctuations is only 0.0040% of a 5pW incident photon power for aluminum detectors and 0.0023% for titanium-nitride detectors, a negligible level for CCAT science goals. This highlights the success of the cryogenic system design and thermal management.",

In-lab testing of Mod-Cam and the first CCAT instrument module, a 280 GHz broadband camera fielding over 10,000 kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs), is currently underway. CCAT's first-generation science instrument, Prime-Cam, will field approximately 100,000 KIDs across seven instrument modules. Like Mod-Cam, it employs 46 cm long low-thermal-conductivity flexible circuits (\"stripline\") between 4 K and 300 K to connect large arrays of multiplexed detectors in each instrument module to readout electronics. The 280 GHz camera currently installed in Mod-Cam uses six striplines to read out its over 10,000 detectors across 18 RF chains, each individual stripline containing six traces. In-lab testing thus far has allowed us to begin optimizing the attenuation in the readout chains for each of the three detector arrays in the 280 GHz module and demonstrate simultaneous readout of all networks using CCAT's RFSoC warm readout electronics. Here we present an overview of the Mod-Cam cold readout and discuss the stripline performance by investigating how its thermal conductivity impacts Mod-Cam and Prime-Cam cryogenic performance. We also report on stripline electrical transmission and crosstalk, identifying transition printed circuit boards (PCBs) as the dominant source of crosstalk. Using this result we outline design improvements to these PCBs that enhance isolation between readout networks.",

Furthermore, we perform a quantitative assessment of the ability of both intimately- and linearly-mixed models to reproduce laboratory data of different grain mixtures of water ice, as well as water ice mixed with epsomite. We find that smaller grains of water ice impart a stronger influence than larger grains of water ice on the 2.0 {\\mu}m spectral feature in epsomite, and grain size signatures for both halite and epsomite are challenging to discern for larger grain sizes as a result of the saturated absorption features. These findings may indicate that an observation bias toward smaller grain sizes of ice could exist, and that quantitative assessments provided by spectral mixture analyses will be the most reliable method for determining compositions and abundances of materials. We also find that the linearly-mixed and intimately-mixed models of water ice appear to match the laboratory spectra as expected, though still display some inconsistencies, often either in the continuum or the absorption features. When modeling pure water ice and water ice mixed with epsomite, no discernible difference is observed between the fits of the linearly- and intimately-mixed models. Future spectral mixture analyses that use epsomite should be aware of a potential error in the published epsomite optical constant data, in which the cryogenic data appear to be taken at ambient conditions.",

Instrum. 94, 074502 (2023) Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det) The Kamioka Gravitational wave detector (KAGRA) cryogenic gravitational-wave observatory has commenced joint observations with the worldwide gravitational wave detector network. Precise calibration of the detector response is essential for accurately estimating parameters of gravitational wave sources. A photon calibrator is a crucial calibration tool used in laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory, Virgo, and KAGRA, and it was utilized in joint observation 3 with GEO600 in Germany in April 2020. In this paper, KAGRA implemented three key enhancements: a high-power laser, a power stabilization system, and remote beam position control. KAGRA employs a 20 W laser divided into two beams that are injected onto the mirror surface. By utilizing a high-power laser, the response of the detector at kHz frequencies can be calibrated. To independently control the power of each laser beam, an optical follower servo was installed for power stabilization. The optical path of the photon calibrator beam positions was controlled using pico-motors, allowing for the characterization of the detector rotation response. Additionally, a telephoto camera and quadrant photodetectors were installed to monitor beam positions, and beam position control was implemented to optimize the mirror response. In this paper, we discuss the statistical errors associated with the measurement of relative power noise. We also address systematic errors related to the power calibration model of the photon calibrator and the simulation of elastic deformation effects using finite element analysis. Ultimately, we have successfully reduced the total systematic error from the photon calibrator to 2.0 /%.",

Numerical simulations have advanced our understanding of these events, enabling estimations of mass and atmospheric loss during the primary impacts. However, high computational costs have restricted investigations to the immediate aftermath, limiting our understanding of the longer-term consequences. In this study, we investigate the effect of re-accretion of giant impact debris, a process previously overlooked, on the atmospheres of terrestrial planets. Following the collisional and dynamical evolution of the debris ejected during the primary impacts, we quantify the amount of debris that would be re-accreted by the progenitor. We find that $\\sim 0.003\\ M_{\\oplus}$ would be re-accreted over a wide range of Earth-like planet properties, assuming $1\\%$ of their mass is ejected as non-vaporised debris. Over a prolonged period, the secondary impacts during re-accretion drive enhanced atmospheric loss. Notably, the impacts from the debris of the canonical Moon-forming impact would have gradually eroded an atmosphere similar to present-day Earth's in $\\sim 30$ Myr. More generally, any planet growing via giant impacts within $2$ au is likely to experience significant post-impact atmospheric erosion unless the initial atmosphere was at least $5$ times more massive than Earth's. Our results highlight the crucial role secondary impacts from giant-impact ejecta could have in driving the long-term atmospheric evolution of Earth-like planets, and demonstrate that giant impacts can be significantly more effective at eroding such atmospheres than previously thought, when re-accretion of debris is considered.",

Submitted to MNRAS Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Dynamical interactions between planets and debris discs can excite the orbits of embedded planetesimals to such a degree that a collisional cascade is triggered, generating detectable amounts of dust. Millimetre wavelength observations are sensitive to emission from large and cold dust grains, which are unperturbed by radiation forces and act as a proxy for the location of the planetesimals. The influence of unseen planetary companions on debris discs can be inferred with high-resolution imaging observations at millimetre wavelengths, tracing the radial and vertical structure of these belts. Here we present a set of dynamical $N$-body simulations modelling ALMA millimetre-wavelength observations of the HD 16743 debris disc system. In these simulations, we consider a range of relative contributions from either a single planetary companion and/or a set of embedded massive planetesimals to reproduce the disc's observed radial and vertical structure. We compare our dynamical results for the limiting cases of planet-stirring and self-stirring, finding them to be consistent with theoretical expectations for each scenario. For the case of HD 16743, we find that a set of massive planetesimals on mildly eccentric orbits, confined to a relatively narrow range of semimajor axes (compared to the observed belt width), offers the best results to reproduce the vertical and radial extent of the observed emission.",

Recent surveys have revealed that planets residing in the desert are dense (${\\rho}{\\gtrsim}1$ g/cm$^{3}$), massive ($\\sim$10${-}$50 $M_{\\oplus}$), and orbit metal-rich stars that are indistinguishable from those hosting hot Jupiters. However, their origins remain mysterious. In this work we adopt and test the hypothesis that tidal destruction of hot Jupiters can populate the sub-Jovian desert with stripped remnant planets. We first show that stars hosting desert dwellers exhibit Galactic kinematics indicative of an older population descended from those hosting hot Jupiters. We highlight that tidally-driven Roche lobe overflow (RLO) can indeed populate the desert with planets similar to those observed, but only if angular momentum transfer during RLO is inefficient (``lossy\" RLO). The entire width of the sub-Jovian desert can be backfilled with the remnants of hot Jupiters that possessed their empirically inferred spread in entropy. In this picture, current desert dwellers such as LTT 9779b should be tidally decaying at an observationally testable rate of ${\\sim}0.5$ ms/yr. Our theory also predicts that desert dweller host stars may rotate up to an order of magnitude more rapidly than field stars; rotation period differences may persist ${\\sim}$Gyr after RLO. Lossy RLO may also manifest as a burst of IR excess that could outshine the host star for up to ${\\sim}10^{3}$ yr. If these predictions are confirmed by observations, our theory indicates that desert dwellers can be leveraged to study the interiors of giant planets in exquisite detail.",

We first benchmark our structural/thermal evolution calculations against the \\texttt{MESA} stellar evolution code, finding excellent agreement across a wide range of planet mass, equilibrium temperature, entropy, and extra heating deposited at various depths in the planet. We then apply our method to study the tidal migration histories of Neptunes in the recently identified ``ridge\" (periods ${\\sim}3{-}6$ days), a feature that has been suggested to be populated via high eccentricity migration (HEM) of more distant Neptunes. We find that it is difficult to form a circularized Neptune in the ridge without instigating runaway tidal inflation and likely atmospheric destruction; low eccentricity Neptunes in the ridge can only be emplaced by HEM if they are metal-rich and exhibit finely-tuned tidal quality factors. If follow-up observations confirm that low eccentricity Neptunes in the ridge did arrive via HEM and are not strongly enriched in metals, our calculations indicate that their tidal heating mechanism must operate in the upper reaches of the planet to avoid runaway inflation. Gravity modes excited in upper radiative layers are a possible candidate mechanism, while friction in the core or turbulent dissipation in convective zones could be ruled out.",

The longer orbital periods and transit durations of warm Jupiters make it more difficult to measure the obliquities of their host stars. However, the longer periods also mean any misalignments persist due to the longer tidal realignment timescales. As a result, measuring these obliquities is necessary to understand how these types of planets form and how their formation and evolution differ from that of hot Jupiters. Here, we report the measurement of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for the TOI-4127 system using the HARPS-N spectrograph. We model the system using our new HARPS-N radial velocity measurements in addition to archival TESS photometry and NEID and SOPHIE radial velocities. We find that the host star is well-aligned with the highly eccentric (e=0.75) warm Jupiter TOI-4127 b, with a sky-projected obliquity ${\\lambda} = {4^\\circ}^{+17^\\circ}_{-16^\\circ}$. This makes TOI-4127 one of the most eccentric well-aligned systems to date and one of the longest period systems with a measured obliquity. Conclusions. The origin of its highly eccentric yet well-aligned orbit remains a mystery, however, and we investigate possible scenarios that could explain it. While typical in-situ formation and disk migration scenarios cannot explain this system, certain scenarios involving resonant interactions between the planet and protoplanetary disc could. Similarly, specific cases of planet-planet scattering or Kozai-Lidov oscillations can result in a highly-eccentric and well-aligned orbit. Coplanar high-eccentricity migration could also explain this system. However, both this mechanism and Kozai-Lidov oscillations require an additional planet in the system that has not yet been detected.",

We study WASP-80b, a warm Jupiter orbiting an M-dwarf star, using the latest JWST panchromatic emission and transmission spectra to comprehensively characterize its atmosphere, including cloud coverage, chemical composition, and particle sizes, and compare the observations with predictions from general circulation models (GCMs). We use a General Circulation Model (GCM), ADAM (ADvanced Atmospheric MITgcm, formerly known as SPARC/MITgcm), combined with the latest JWST data to study the atmosphere of WASP-80b. A cloud module with radiatively active, tracer-based clouds is integrated with the GCM to study the effects on the atmosphere and the spectrum. Our results indicate that both emission and transmission spectra are well fit by cloudless GCMs. The data appear to be compatible with large cloud particles of any cloud species or KCl clouds of all particle sizes. The Na$_2$S condensates of radii 0.1 and 1 $\\mu$m can be ruled out due to the strength of their radiative feedback.

Accepted for publication in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Simultaneous measurements of volatile and refractory elements are essential for tracing the formation and migration of ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs). High-resolution infrared emission spectroscopy has been widely used to probe their atmospheres, covering molecules and atoms. For the hottest known planet, KELT-9b, whose dayside atmosphere is nearly fully dissociated and ionized, no molecules had been firmly detected. Here we report the first detection of OH in the dayside atmosphere of KELT-9b, based on two thermal emission observations with the SPIRou spectrograph, and confirm the presence of Fe. We performed a self-consistent retrieval under chemical equilibrium, constraining elemental abundances and metallicity. A significant thermal inversion layer is confirmed. No significant Doppler shifts were found, and the retrieved equatorial rotation matches the tidally locked value. The oxygen abundance is consistent with solar to supersolar (0.61$_{-0.58}^{+1.19}$ dex), while the C/O ratio and metallicity are subsolar to solar. The low metallicity may indicate a well-mixed envelope and interior. Constraints remain broad, and the data are consistent with supersolar C/O and subsolar O. Combined [C/O] and [O/H] are compatible with formation beyond the water snowline followed by inward migration, though other scenarios cannot be excluded. Volatile-to-refractory ratios, [O/Fe] = 1.25$_{-0.74}^{+0.99}$ dex and [C/Fe] = 0.60$_{-0.74}^{+0.62}$ dex, lie in the solar to supersolar range, but uncertainties limit firm conclusions. Results provide tentative evidence for volatile enrichment. Future high-resolution optical-to-infrared spectra with JWST will enable more precise abundance constraints and stronger insights into UHJ formation and migration. We also advocate a retrieval-guided cross-correlation strategy to reduce risk of missing marginal detections, as illustrated by tentative evidence for CO.",

In this work, we investigate the formation of USP planets in two-planet systems consisting of an inner terrestrial planet accompanied by an outer hot Jupiter (HJ). Our simulation results show USP planets can form through a process driven by secular perturbations from the outer companion, which induce eccentricity excitation, tidal dissipation, and subsequent orbital decay of the inner planet. The probability of USP formation is governed by key factors, including the mass ratio between two planets, their orbital eccentricities, and the tidal dissipation process. 6.7\\% of our simulations form USP planets, and USP planets form most efficiently when the mass ratio is around 4 $M_{\\oplus}{\\rm /}M_{\\rm J}$, with the inner planet less than 8 $M_{\\oplus}$. Furthermore, the eccentricity of the outer HJ plays a crucial role-moderate eccentricities ($e_{\\rm outer}<0.1$) favor USP formation, whereas higher eccentricities ($e_{\\rm outer}>0.1$) enhance the likelihood of orbital instability, often resulting in a lonely HJ. USP planets form more efficiently when the tidal dissipation function of the inner planet is comparable to the values estimated for terrestrial planets in the solar system. Comparison with observed planetary systems reveals that systems with large mass ratios or nearly circular outer planets tend to produce short-period (SP) planets instead of USP planets. Our findings offer a potential explanation for the most commonly observed system architectures, which predominantly feature either an HJ with an inner SP planet or a lonely HJ.",

Saillenfest 19 pages, 11 figures, 1 table, 1 appendix, submitted Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Recent measurements suggest that Uranus may exhibit a higher tidal dissipation than previously assumed. This enhanced dissipation leads to a faster orbital migration of its five major moons: Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. Consequently, resonant encounters that have always been discarded in previous works need to be included. In particular, Ariel's fast migration implies that the crossing of the 2:1 mean motion resonance with Umbriel is extremely likely and it could have occurred in recent times. Capture into this strong resonance would have induced significant tidal heating within Ariel, possibly explaining its resurfacing. Therefore, in this work, we aim to explore the orbital history of the Uranian moons in a context of fast tidal migration, including the crossing of the 2:1 mean motion resonance between Ariel and Umbriel. For small initial eccentricities, we confirm that the moons are always captured into this resonance. As the system is not currently involved in any mean motion resonance, we investigated possible dynamical mechanisms for exiting the 2:1 resonance. We show that the resonance could have been broken by a further resonant encounter with Titania. We analyzed the crossing of the 4:2:1 and 3:2:1 resonant chains, and looked for the parameter space where the probability of escaping the resonance is maximized. Taking a dissipative parameter of Ariel $k_{2,2}/Q_2<10^{-3}$, the passage through the 3:2:1 resonance succeeds in disrupting the 2:1 Ariel-Umbriel mean motion resonance in more than $60\\%$ of our numerical experiments. A fraction of our simulations results in final low eccentricities and inclinations, which can eventually match the current orbital features of the system. As the proposed orbital history requires specific ranges of the dissipative parameters for the system, future Uranus mission data will validate (or disprove) this scenario.",

      "abstract": "Turbulence and dust fragility in protoplanetary discs Simin Tong, Richard Alexander, Giovanni Rosotti Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Dust growth from micron- to planet-size in protoplanetary discs involves multiple physical processes, including dust growth and fragmentation, the streaming instability, and pebble accretion. Disc turbulence and dust fragility matter at almost every stage. Previous studies typically vary one of them while fixing the other, failing to provide a complete picture. Here, we use analytical models and numerical dust evolution models DustPy to study the combinations of gas turbulence and dust fragility that can reproduce multi-wavelength ALMA observables. We find only appropriate combinations -- fragile dust (fragmentation velocity $v_\\mathrm{frag}$= 1-2 m/s) in discs with viscous $\\alpha=10^{-4}$ or resilient dust ($v_\\mathrm{frag}$= 6-10 m/s) in discs with viscous $\\alpha=10^{-3}$ -- can reproduce observations. Our result is robust to two widely used opacities (DSHARP and Ricci opacities). Regardless of the strength of disc turbulence, reproducing observations requires observed dust rings to be optically thick at $\\lambda=1.3$ and $3$ mm. As only small dust can be lifted above the midplane to reach the emitting layers, SED analysis probably yields lower limits on the maximum grain sizes. We highlight the challenge of creating detectable dust rings at large radii when incorporating bouncing in models, and the need for earlier formation of dust rings at smaller radii to reproduce the decreasing ring brightness with radius observed across ALMA wavelengths.",

Sefilian, Marie Ygouf, Jorge Llop-Sayson Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We present JWST/MIRI observations of the debris disk surrounding the nearby, solar analog Epsilon Eridani obtained as part of the Archetypal Debris Disk GTO program. Multi-wavelength images from 15, 18, 21, and 25.5 $\\mu m$ show a smooth dust distribution with no evidence of sculpting by massive planets outside of 5 au. Maps of the color temperature and opacity constrain the dust properties while radiative transfer modeling of a warm dust component traces the interaction between the debris disk and Epsilon Eri b ($\\sim$3.5 au). Dynamical and collisional modeling further shows that the disk morphology is dominated by dust produced in the outer planetesimal belt ($\\sim 70 \\, au$) moving inward via stellar wind drag. We confirm the presence of a disk interior to the Epsilon Eri b orbit first detected from mid-IR interferometry. Drag dominated inner disk regions have also been observed around Vega and Fomalhaut hinting at the diversity of asteroid belt analogs.",

      "abstract": "Induction Heating in Super-Earths: A Thermochemical Perspective Yihang Peng, Kristina Kislyakova, Donghao Zheng, Zhongtian Zhang, Jie Deng Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Electromagnetic induction heating has recently been proposed as an important internal heat source in the mantles of rocky exoplanets. However, its dependence on planetary interior properties remains poorly constrained. Here we construct electrical conductivity profiles for super-Earth mantles considering different temperatures and compositions, and evaluate induction heating in super-Earth mantles in both solid and partially molten states. We find that high mantle temperature, iron content, and melt fraction all suppress the overall induction heating efficiency due to increased mantle conductivity and magnetic shielding. In GJ 486b, induction heating likely exceeds both radiogenic heating and tidal heating, driving persistent surface volcanism and early volatile depletion, whereas HD 3167b and GJ 357b experience insignificant induction heating due to weak stellar magnetic fields. Our findings highlight induction heating as a critical factor in the thermal and atmospheric evolution of close-in super-Earths around magnetically active stars.",

Coelho, Lisa Kaltenegger, William Philpot, Adam J. Ellington, Noelle Bryan, Stephen Zinder, Brent C. Christner Manuscript in revision, following peer review. 10 pages, 3 figures, 1 table Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) When Carl Sagan and Ed Salpeter envisioned potential Sinkers, Floaters, and Hunters living in Jupiter's clouds in 1976 (C. Sagan & E. E. Salpeter 1976), the nature of life in Earth's atmosphere remained widely unknown. Decades later, research has revealed a remarkable variety of microorganisms in our atmosphere. However, the spectral features of airborne microbes as biomarkers for detecting atmospheric life remained a mystery. Here, we present the first reflectance spectra of biopigments of atmospheric microorganisms based on laboratory cultivars of seven microbial strains isolated from Earth's atmosphere. We show their distinct UV-resistant biosignatures and their impacts on models of diverse planetary scenarios, using Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) parameters. The reflectance of these biopigments from aerial bacteria creates the means to detect them on other Earth-like planets. It provides a paradigm shift that moves the search for life beyond the surface of a planet to ecosystems in atmospheres and clouds.",

Minor change to the title following editor request. New Figure 9 shows required number of targets to detect signature of high-e migration for varying degrees of astrophysical scatter Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) In spite of their long detection history, the origin of hot Jupiters remains to be resolved. While multiple dynamical evidence suggests high-eccentricity migration is most likely, conflicts remain when considering hot Jupiters as a population in the context of warm and cold Jupiters. Here, we turn to atmospheric signatures as an alternative mean to test the origin theory of hot Jupiters, focusing on population level trends that arise from post-formation pollution, motivated by the upcoming Ariel space mission whose goal is to deliver a uniform sample of exoplanet atmospheric constraints. We experiment with post-formation pollution by planetesimal accretion, pebble accretion, and disk-induced migration and find that an observable signature of post-formation pollution is only possible under pebble accretion in metal-heavy disks. If most hot Jupiters arrive at their present orbit by high-eccentricity migration while warm Jupiters emerge largely in situ, we expect the atmospheric water abundance of hot Jupiters to be significantly elevated compared to warm Jupiters. We report on the detectability of such signatures and further provide suggestions for future comparative atmospheric characterization between hot Jupiters and wide-orbit directly imaged planets to elucidate the properties of the dust substructures in protoplanetary disks.",
