Within this setting, we compute the exact relativistic luminosity distance via the Sachs equation and compare it with the approximate expression obtained from the covariant cosmographic approach (including Hubble, deceleration, jerk and curvature parameters). This comparison allows us to identify the regimes in which the covariant cosmographic method remains reliable. In addition, we compare the LTB relativistic distance for small inhomogeneities with the corresponding result derived from linear perturbation theory (LPT) in the standard cosmological model. This analysis establishes a precise correspondence between the LTB and LPT approaches, offering a consistent dictionary for the interpretation of the observed anisotropies of the large-scale gravitational field. This analysis will be instrumental in interpreting expansion-rate anisotropies, facilitating investigations of the local Universe beyond the FLRW framework with a fully non-perturbative metric approach.",

Here, we introduce the methodology to search for gravitational waves from these events with Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). Modelling the inspiral, the merger, the ringdown, and the gravitational wave memory components of the signal in simulated data, we demonstrate a proof of principle for detection and parameter estimation. We study a few representative SMBHB mergers with chirp masses spanning $10^{8} - 10^{10}~M_\\odot$ at distances from a few Mpc to 100~Mpc to asses their detectability in PTA observations. Assuming the fixed binary inclination angle of $90^{\\circ}$ corresponding to the maximum displacement memory signal, these signals appear distinct for a PTA with 25 pulsars timed for 13 years with 100 ns precision. We demonstrate the capabilities of PTAs to constrain chirp masses and distances of detected merging binaries, as well as to place limits. The sky position uncertainties of the order of $1^{\\circ}$, which we find in this optimistic example, could potentially enable electromagnetic follow-up and multi-messenger observations of SMBHB mergers. Finally, we show that the measurement uncertainties on the parameters of simulated merging binaries depend weakly on the presence of the gravitational wave background with Hellings-Downs correlations in our simulated data.",

In this work, we address the tension between early JWST observations of luminous high-redshift galaxies and predictions of the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model by revisiting the physics of dark matter halo formation. Employing refined halo mass functions derived by Del Popolo \\textit{et al.} (DP1 and DP2) that incorporate angular momentum, dynamical friction, and redshift-dependent collapse barriers, we demonstrate a significant enhancement in the abundance of massive halos at $z \\gtrsim 7$ compared to the conventional Sheth-Tormen (ST) formalism. Using a semi-empirical framework linking halo mass to UV luminosity, we show that the DP2 model reproduces the observed UV luminosity functions from $z = 7$ to $14$ with moderate star formation efficiencies, whereas the ST model requires implausibly high efficiencies. Our results suggest that the JWST overabundance problem stems not from new physics beyond $\\Lambda$CDM, but from oversimplified treatments of gravitational collapse, highlighting the critical role of small-scale dissipative dynamics in early structure formation.",

Price 11 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ApJL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) When debris from a star that experienced a tidal disruption events (TDE) after passing too close to a massive black hole returns to pericenter on the second passage, it is compressed, leading to the formation of nozzle shocks (in the orbital plane) and pancake shocks (perpendicular to the orbital plane). Resolving these shocks is a long-standing problem in the hydrodynamic simulations of parabolic TDEs. Excessive numerical energy dissipation or heating unrealistically expands the stream. In this Letter, we apply adaptive particle refinement to our 3D general relativistic smoothed particle simulations to locally increase the resolution near the pericenter. We achieve resolutions equivalent to $6.55\\times10^{11}$ particles, allowing us to converge on the true energy dissipation. We conclude that only $4\\times10^{-5}$ of the orbital energy is dissipated in nozzle shocks for a Sun-like star tidally disrupted by a $10^6$ solar-mass black hole, therefore the nozzle shocks are unlikely to be important in the evolution of TDEs.",

Pereira, Andrius Tamosiunas (COMPACT Collaboration) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) If the Universe has non-trivial spatial topology, observables depend on both the parameters of the spatial manifold and the position and orientation of the observer. In infinite Euclidean space, most cosmological observables arise from the amplitudes of Fourier modes of primordial scalar curvature perturbations. Topological boundary conditions replace the full set of Fourier modes with specific linear combinations of selected Fourier modes as the eigenmodes of the scalar Laplacian. In this paper we consider the non-orientable Euclidean topologies \\E{7}--\\E{10}, \\E{13}--\\E{15}, and \\E{17}, encompassing the full range of manifold parameters and observer positions, generalizing previous treatments. Under the assumption that the amplitudes of primordial scalar curvature eigenmodes are independent random variables, for each topology we obtain the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes (of scalar fields linearly related to the scalar curvature) and the correlation matrices of spherical-harmonic coefficients of such fields sampled on a sphere, such as the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We evaluate the detectability of these correlations given the cosmic variance of the CMB sky. We find that in manifolds where the distance to our nearest clone is less than about $1.2$ times the diameter of the last scattering surface of the CMB, we expect a correlation signal that is larger than cosmic variance noise in the CMB. Our limited selection of manifold parameters are exemplary of interesting behaviors, but not necessarily representative. Future searches for topology will require a thorough exploration of the parameter space to determine what values of the parameters predict statistical correlations that are convincingly attributable to topology.[Abridged]",

Quantum Grav. 42 (2025) 195018 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) A key signature of general relativity is that the two scalar potentials $\\Phi$ and $\\Psi$, when expressed in the longitudinal gauge, are equal in the absence of fluids with anisotropic stress. This is often expressed by stating that their ratio, the \"gravitational slip\", is equal to unity. However, the equality of $\\Phi$ and $\\Psi$ is typically broken in alternative theories of gravity. Observational constraints on the slip parameter are therefore of direct interest for testing Einstein's theory. In this paper we derive theory-independent expressions for the slip parameter on both large and small scales in Friedmann cosmologies, expressing it as a function of the post-Newtonian parameters. This is the final ingredient required for a complete parameterization of dust and dark energy-dominated cosmologies within the framework of Parameterized Post-Newtonian Cosmology (PPNC), which allows for the fully self-consistent modelling of cosmological observables without assuming any specific theory of gravity.",

Moreover, based on this QPE model, we show that the signal-to-noise ratio of the gravitational wave signals from QPEs, if detectable, will be sufficiently high to distinguish such systems from vacuum EMRIs and shed light on the origin of QPEs and environments around massive black holes.",

In this scenario, a stellar-mass BH binary undergoes isolated binary evolution and merges while hosting a distant, dynamically unimportant tertiary stellar companion. The tertiary becomes relevant only after the merger, when the remnant BH receives a GW recoil kick. Depending on the kick velocity and system configuration, the outcome can be: (i) a bright electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to the GW merger; (ii) an LMXB; (iii) a wide BH-stellar companion resembling the Gaia BH population; or (iv) an unbound, isolated BH. Modeling the three-body dynamics, we find that $\\sim 0.02\\%$ of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) mergers may be followed by an EM counterpart within $\\sim$10 days, produced by tidal disruption of the star by the BH. The flare is likely brightest in the optical-UV and lasts days to weeks; in some cases, partial disruption causes recurring flares with a period of $\\sim$2 months. We further estimate that this channel can produce $\\sim 1-10\\%$ of Gaia BH systems in the Milky Way. This scenario provides the first physically motivated link between GW sources, Gaia BHs, and some X-ray binaries, and predicts a rare but robust pathway for EM counterparts to binary BH mergers, potentially detectable in LVK's O5 run.",

Additionally, codebase was redesigned and relocated which will be easier to review Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Gravitational wave detection requires sophisticated signal processing to identify weak astrophysical signals buried in instrumental noise. Traditional matched filtering approaches face computational challenges with diverse signal morphologies and non-stationary noise. This work presents a deep learning methodology integrating Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) preprocessing with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder architecture for gravitational wave detection. The CWT provides optimal time-frequency decomposition capturing chirp evolution and transient characteristics essential for compact binary coalescence identification. We first develop the model using synthetic datasets incorporating binary black hole merger signals with masses ranging from 10 to 80 solar masses. These signals are then embedded in colored Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity. The trained model demonstrates strong performance metrics. We then apply the CWT-LSTM model to gravitational wave data from multiple LIGO observing runs. We use 1639 clean noise samples for training the anomaly detection model, while the test dataset contained a mix of 114 confirmed gravitational wave events and 410 noise samples. The model demonstrates strong performance with an AUC of 1.000 and Average Precision (AP) of 1.000, achieving a precision of 1.0 at the optimal threshold with a recall of 1.0. The reconstruction error distribution shows clear separation between noise and gravitational wave signals, with noise samples clustering around lower reconstruction error values and signals around higher reconstruction error values. This unsupervised approach enables discovery of signals with unknown morphologies that could provide complementary \"blind search\" capability for detecting exotic astrophysical sources and novel physics beyond current theoretical models.",

Comments are welcome! Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We investigate uncertainties in the estimation of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) arising from Gaussian Process (GP) reconstruction, demonstrating that the choice of kernel introduces systematic variations comparable to those arising from different cosmological models. To address this limitation, we introduce the Generalized Gaussian Process (Gen GP) framework, in which the Matérn smoothness parameter $\\nu$ is treated as a free parameter, allowing for data-driven kernel optimization. Using the cosmic chronometer Hubble data, we find that while standard GP with $\\Lambda$CDM mean function exhibits noticeable reconstruction differences between optimized and marginalized approaches, particularly at $z > 1$, Gen GP maintains methodological consistency. In Gen GP, slight increases in $\\chi^2$ per degree of freedom relative to standard GP, for both the zero-mean and $\\Lambda$CDM prior mean cases, reflect added flexibility rather than performance degradation. Our results emphasize that robust cosmological inference requires treating kernel parameters as free variables and implementing full Bayesian marginalization to avoid artificial precision from fixed hyperparameters. As machine learning becomes central to cosmological discovery, the Gen GP framework provides a principled approach to model-independent inference that properly accounts for methodological uncertainties while maintaining necessary flexibility for reliable parameter estimation.",

In 1D, the strongest deviation occurs for MmAH1 ($2.5\\sigma$), followed by CPL ($2.3\\sigma$). In 2D, CPL-$w_{\\rm b}$ shows the highest discrepancy ($2.3\\sigma$), while other models remain at the $1.7$-$2.1\\sigma$ level. In 3D, CPL-$w_{\\rm b}$ continues to exhibit the largest tension ($\\sim2\\sigma$), though this arises in the presence of very strong correlations, particularly between $w_{\\rm a}$ and $w_{\\rm b}$, whereas the MmAH extensions display slightly weaker but still non-negligible discrepancies ($1.4$-$1.8\\sigma$). Overall, these results indicate consistent evidence for departures from $\\Lambda$CDM.",

Sheikh-Jabbari 7 pages, 3 figures, comments welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We perform a consistency check of DESI DR2 BAO constraints ($D_M/r_d, D_H/r_d)$ by reconstructing the same quantities from DES supernovae (SNe) in bins with the same effective redshift $z_{\\textrm{eff}}$. We find that the ratio of $D_M/r_d$ values are consistent with a horizontal, thus confirming that the distance duality relation holds up to calibration. However, the $D_H/r_d$ ratio shows a decreasing trend with $z_{\\textrm{eff}}$ at $2.3 \\sigma$ to $2.5 \\sigma$ that cannot be explained by physics. We demonstrate that the result does not depend on the choice of cosmological model, but the radius of the sound horizon $r_d$ has a much greater influence. Studying ratios of $D_H/r_d$ is a stronger test than the distance duality relation, and the rejection of a horizontal confirms systematics in either DESI BAO or DES SNe. Claims of new physics based on combined data still have rudimentary hurdles to clear.",

The Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization -- a widely used two-parameter model for the dark energy equation of state -- displays marked early-time phantom behavior and a recent crossing of the phantom divide. These features suggest the convenience to check observationally the robustness of such evolution. To address this, we design two alternative families of two-parameter dark energy parameterizations which remain close to the original CPL but aim to soften its phantom character. Specifically, these models reproduce CPL-like behavior at low redshift but mitigate early phantom behavior through the use of smooth sigmoid transitions, yielding a more gradual evolution. By combining recent DESI data with constraints from the cosmic microwave background and Type Ia supernovae, we assess the viability of these models. Our analysis shows that CPL remains a strong and competitive parameterization, with the proposed alternatives only marginally favored or disfavored. We conclude that current observational data lack the statistical precision to decisively distinguish between CPL and similarly constructed parameterizations across the redshift range probed by late-time observables.",

However, any effective neutrino number itself cannot uniquely determine the underlying source. We argue that the degeneracy can be relaxed by CMB spectral distortions, which are caused by energy exchange between the extra radiation and photons. We consider neutrinogenic CMB spectral distortions, where extra energy is released in the form of neutrinos but still creates the CMB spectral distortions via electroweak interactions. The synergy between the effective neutrino number and CMB spectral distortions provides a complementary probe of hidden sectors that dominantly couple to neutrinos, opening up parameter space that can be targeted by joint CMB anisotropy and spectral distortion experiments.",

We develop a general framework in which to evaluate the rare tail of this distribution, based on an instanton approximation to a path integral representation for the transition probability. We relate our formalism to the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral, by integrating out short wavelength degrees of freedom to produce an influence functional. This provides a principled way to extend the calculation beyond the slow-roll limit, and to models with multiple fields. We argue that our framework has a number of advantages in comparison with existing methods. In particular, it reliably captures the tail behaviour in cases where existing techniques do not apply, including cases where the noise amplitude has strong time dependence. We demonstrate the method by computing the tail probability in a number of scenarios, including a beyond-slow-roll analysis of a linear potential, ultra-slow-roll, and constant-roll inflation. We find close agreement with results already reported in the literature. Finally, we discuss a scenario with exponentially decaying noise amplitude. This is a model for the stochastic evolution of a fixed comoving volume of spacetime on superhorizon scales. In this case we show that the tail reverts to a Gaussian weight.",

Lindholm Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) This is the second paper in the HOWLS (higher-order weak lensing statistics) series exploring the usage of non-Gaussian statistics for cosmology inference within \\textit{Euclid}. With respect to our first paper, we develop a full tomographic analysis based on realistic photometric redshifts which allows us to derive Fisher forecasts in the ($\\sigma_8$, $w_0$) plane for a \\textit{Euclid}-like data release 1 (DR1) setup. We find that the 5 higher-order statistics (HOSs) that satisfy the Gaussian likelihood assumption of the Fisher formalism (1-point probability distribution function, $\\ell$1-norm, peak counts, Minkowski functionals, and Betti numbers) each outperform the shear 2-point correlation functions by a factor $2.5$ on the $w_0$ forecasts, with only marginal improvement when used in combination with 2-point estimators, suggesting that every HOS is able to retrieve both the non-Gaussian and Gaussian information of the matter density field. The similar performance of the different estimators\\inlinecomment{, with a slight preference for Minkowski functionals and 1-point probability distribution function,} is explained by a homogeneous use of multi-scale and tomographic information, optimized to lower computational costs. These results hold for the $3$ mass mapping techniques of the \\textit{Euclid} pipeline: aperture mass, Kaiser--Squires, and Kaiser--Squires plus, and are unaffected by the application of realistic star masks. Finally, we explore the use of HOSs with the Bernardeau--Nishimichi--Taruya (BNT) nulling scheme approach, finding promising results towards applying physical scale cuts to HOSs.",

We begin by using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) coupled with a normalizing flow to explore global statistical descriptors of galaxy populations, such as the mean, standard deviation, and histograms of 14 galaxy properties. We find that subhalo gas mass is the most informative feature for constraining the WDM mass, achieving a determination coefficient of R^2 = 0.9. We employ symbolic regression to extract simple, interpretable relations with the WDM particle mass. Finally, we adopt a more localized approach by selecting individual dark matter halos and using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a normalizing flow to infer the WDM mass, incorporating subhalo properties as node features and global simulation statistics as graph-level features. The GNN approach yields only a residual improvement over MLP models based solely on global features, indicating that most of the predictive power resides in the global descriptors, with only marginal gains from halo-level information.",

Mahtessian Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of massive galaxies at ages below 1 Gyr pose a challenge to standard models of galaxy formation, which predict significantly longer assembly timescales. One possible explanation is that active galactic nuclei (AGN) drive large scale outflows that accelerate galaxy growth. To test this scenario in the local Universe, we analyzed Gaia DR3 data for stars within 5 kpc of the Galactic center, computing galactocentric radial velocities (v_radial_gc) in 27 spatial sectors covering the entire Galaxy, with radial binning of 0.25 kpc. Coordinate transformations and velocity calculations were performed using the Astropy library. We find that 21 of 27 sectors exhibit statistically significant outward motions of 3-50 km/s, while one quadrant shows negative velocities, likely related to the configuration of an activity zone and/or the Galactic bar. Both disk and halo populations also display small but significant mean expansion of 3-9 km/s (p<0.01). These results are consistent with our previous studies, where globular clusters showed outward velocities of 17-31 km/s up to 12 kpc, and axisymmetric analyses of Gaia DR3 stars indicated expansion of ~19 km/s to 5 kpc. Taken together, the evidence suggests that the Milky Way exhibits measurable central expansion, potentially reflecting AGN-driven feedback. This interpretation departs from standard theory and should be regarded as preliminary, requiring further study. However, if confirmed, such expansion could provide a natural explanation for the rapid appearance of massive galaxies observed by JWST.",

Our analysis utilizes about 16 years of optical photometric data of 146 AGNs from various time-domain surveys, including ASAS-SN, CRTS, and ZTF, along with 14 years of infrared data in the $W$1 ($\\sim$ 3.4 $\\mu$m) and $W$2 ($\\sim$ 4.6 $\\mu$m) bands obtained from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The estimated dust torus size ranges from 1000 to 3000 days, using both the cross-correlation analysis and lightcurve modeling through `MICA'. The measured lag has been corrected by $(1+z)^{-0.37}$, to account for cosmological time dilation and the torus temperature-gradient scaling. We conduct a linear regression analysis for both the $W$1 and $W$2 bands to examine the radius--luminosity ($R$--$L_{BOL}$) relationship under two conditions: one where the slope is fixed at 0.5 and one where it is allowed to vary. For the fixed slope of 0.5, we find the ratio of R$_{\\mathrm{BLR}}$: R$_{W1}$: R$_{W2}$ to be 1: 9: 12, indicating that the torus lies outside the BLR and that its size increases with wavelength. Furthermore, we determine the relationship between torus size and L$_{BOL}$, yielding best-fit slopes of $0.413\\pm0.047$ for the $W$1 band and $0.397\\pm0.058$ for the $W$2 band. Both slopes are shallower than predicted by the dust radiation equilibrium model. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the torus size systematically decreases as the Eddington ratio increases, a trend that can be explained by the self-shadowing effects of slim disks.",

We analyze AME in 144 Galactic clouds by combining low-frequency maps from S-PASS (2.3 GHz), C-BASS (4.76 GHz), and QUIJOTE (10-20 GHz) with 21 ancillary maps. Using aperture photometry and parametric SED fitting via MCMC methods without informative priors, we measure AME emissivity, peak frequency, and spectral width. We achieve peak frequency constraints nearly three times tighter than previous work and identify 83 new AME sources. AME spectra are generally broader than predicted by spinning dust models for a single phase of the interstellar medium, suggesting either multiple spinning dust components along the line of sight or incomplete representation of the grain size distribution in current models. However, the narrowest observed widths match theoretical predictions, supporting the spinning dust hypothesis. The AME amplitude correlates most strongly with the thermal dust peak flux and radiance, showing $\\sim30$% scatter and sublinear scaling, which suggests reduced AME efficiency in regions with brighter thermal dust emission. AME peak frequency increases with thermal dust temperature in a trend current theoretical models do not reproduce, indicating that spinning dust models must incorporate dust evolution and radiative transfer in a self-consistent framework where environmental parameters and grain properties are interdependent. PAH tracers correlate with AME emissivity, supporting a physical link to small dust grains. Finally, a log-Gaussian function provides a good empirical description of the AME spectrum across the sample, given current data quality and frequency coverage.",

Updated to match MNRAS version Mon Not R Astron Soc (2025) 1393-1409 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Cosmological information is encoded in the structure of galaxy clusters. In Universes with less matter and larger initial density perturbations, clusters form earlier and have more time to accrete material, leading to a more extended infall region. Thus, measuring the mean mass distribution in the infall region provides a novel cosmological test. The infall region is largely insensitive to baryonic physics, and provides a cleaner structural test than other measures of cluster assembly time such as concentration. We consider cluster samples from three publicly available galaxy cluster catalogues: the Spectroscopic Identification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) catalogue, the X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect selected clusters in the meta-catalogue M2C, and clusters identified in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Survey. Using a preliminary shape catalogue from the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), we derive excess surface mass density profiles for each sample. We then compare the mean profile for the DESI Legacy sample, which is the most complete, to predictions from a suite of simulations covering a range of $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ and $\\sigma_8$, obtaining constraints of $\\Omega_{\\rm m}=0.34\\pm 0.06$ and $\\sigma_8=0.77 \\pm 0.04$. We also measure mean (comoving) splashback radii for SPIDERS, M2C and DESI Legacy Imaging Survey clusters of $1.39^{+0.21}_{-0.18} {\\rm cMpc}$, $1.77^{+0.20}_{-0.18} {\\rm cMpc}/h$ and $1.42^{+0.11}_{-0.12} {\\rm cMpc}/h respectively. Performing this analysis with the final UNIONS shape catalogue and the full sample of spectroscopically observed clusters in DESI, we can expect to improve on the best current constraints from cluster abundance studies by a factor of $2$ or more.",

However, predicting how baryonic processes modify matter statistics at these scales has been challenging. The baryonic correction model (BCM) addresses this by modifying dark-matter-only simulations to mimic baryonic effects, providing a flexible, simulation-based framework for predicting both two-point and HOS. We show that a 3-parameter version of the BCM can jointly fit weak lensing maps' two-point statistics, wavelet phase harmonics coefficients, scattering coefficients, and the third and fourth moments to within 2% accuracy across all scales $\\ell < 2000$ and tomographic bins for a DES-Y3-like redshift distribution ($z \\lesssim 2$), using the FLAMINGO simulations. These results demonstrate the viability of BCM-assisted, simulation-based weak lensing inference of two-point and HOS, paving the way for robust cosmological constraints that fully exploit non-Gaussian information on small spatial scales.",

We also report similar detection significances for the lowest order multipoles of $B_{\\delta EE}$ and $B_{EEE}$, although these are largely driven by stochastic contributions. We show that the first and second order EFT parameters are consistent with those obtained from fitting the IA power spectrum analysis at next-to-leading order, without requiring any priors to break degeneracies for the quadratic bias parameters. Moreover, the inclusion of higher multipole moments of $B_{\\delta\\delta E}$ greatly reduces the errors on second order bias parameters, by factors of 5 or more. The IA bispectrum thus provides an effective means of determining higher order shape bias parameters, thereby characterizing the scale dependence of the IA signal. We also detect parity-odd bispectra such as $B_{\\delta \\delta B}$ and $B_{\\delta EB}$ at $\\sim 10 \\sigma$ significance or more for $k<0.15\\,h$/Mpc and they are fully consistent with the parity-even sector. Furthermore, we check that the Gaussian covariance approximation works reasonably well on the scales we consider here.

Accepted for publication in JCAP Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) is a fundamental and practical condition in observational cosmology that connects the luminosity distance and angular diameter distance. Testing its validity offers a powerful tool to probe new physics beyond the standard cosmological model. In this work, for the first time, we present a novel consistency test of CDDR by combining HII galaxy data with a comprehensive set of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. The BAO measurements include two-dimensional (2D) BAO and three-dimensional (3D) BAO from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), as well as the latest 3D BAO data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2). We adopt four different parameterizations of the distance duality relation parameter, $\\eta(z)$, to investigate possible deviations and their evolution with cosmic time. To ensure accurate redshift matching across datasets, we reconstruct the distance measures through a model-independent Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach. {We find no significant deviation from the CDDR (less than 68% confidence level) among four parameterizations. Furthermore, our results show that the constraints on $\\eta(z)$ obtained separately from 2D and 3D BAO measurements are consistent at the 68% confidence level. This indicates that there is no significant tension between the two datasets under the four parameterizations considered. Our ANN reconstruction of HII galaxies could provide constraints on the CDDR at redshifts beyond the reach of Type Ia supernovae.} Finally, the consistency of our results supports the standard CDDR and demonstrates the robustness of our analytical approach.",

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) JWST has revealed an abundance of supermassive black holes (BHs) in the early Universe, and yet the lowest mass seed black holes that gave rise to these populations remain elusive. Here we present a systematic search for broad-line Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in some of the faintest high-$z$ galaxies surveyed yet by combining ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy with the strong lensing aid in Abell S1063. By employing the profile of the [OIII]$\\lambda 5007$ emission lines as a template for narrow-line components and carefully cross-validating with mock observations, we identify a sample of ten broad-line AGNs at $4.5<z<7.0$ (eight secure, two tentative). The inferred BH masses from the broad H$\\alpha$ line explore the intermediate BH mass regime down to $\\sim 10^{5.5}\\,M_\\odot$. The stellar mass ($M_*$) is estimated with a galaxy+AGN composite model, and we find the BH to stellar mass ratio spans down to $M_{\\rm BH}/M_*\\lesssim 0.1\\%$, unveiling populations on the empirical $M_{\\rm BH}-M*$ relation observed in the local universe. We also derive the black hole mass function and investigate its low-mass end at this epoch. While we confirm the agreement of our results with previous studies at $M_{\\rm BH}\\gtrsim10^{6.5}M_{\\odot}$, we find the mass range of $\\sim 10^{5.5}\\,M_\\odot$ features an enhanced abundance with respect to the extrapolated best-fit Schechter function. Comparison with theoretical models suggests that a possible origin for this enhanced abundance is the direct-collapse BH formation, supporting the scenario that the direct collapse of massive gas clouds is a significant pathway for the earliest supermassive BHs.",

Previous CALET observing runs (O3 and O4) relied on averaged pre/post-event baselines or low-order polynomial fits, approaches that neglect correlated noise, temporal non-stationarity, and the propagation of background uncertainty into derived flux upper limits. These simplifications can lead to reduced sensitivity to faint or atypical transients. In this work, we present a novel Bayesian framework for background estimation based on Gaussian Process (GP) regression and change-point modeling. Our approach captures correlated structures in the detector background, quantifies predictive uncertainties, and propagates them into both detection statistics and Bayesian credible upper limits. We demonstrate, using archival CALET time-tagged event data and simulated signal injections, that our method improves sensitivity to weak short-duration bursts by up to an order of magnitude compared to traditional polynomial fits. This probabilistic background treatment enables a more physically robust interpretation of non-detections and offers a scalable, real-time compatible extension for future joint multi-messenger searches.

The result is a faint, rapidly evolving transient driven by the ejection of intermediate-mass elements and radioactive isotopes such as $^{48}$Cr and $^{52}$Fe, without significant $^{56}$Ni production. These transients may be detectable in upcoming wide-field surveys and could account for a subset of faint thermonuclear supernovae. Long-term evolution of the merger remnant shows that high-velocity PG-1159-type stars might be formed through this scenario, similar to normal CO-CO white dwarf mergers. This work expands our understanding of white dwarf mergers and their implications for nucleosynthesis and stellar evolution.",

Submitted to A&A, comments welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs) are rare extragalactic events of unknown origin. Tidal disruptions of white dwarfs by intermediate mass black holes, mergers of black holes and Wolf-Rayet stars, and failed supernovae are among the suggestions. In this paper, we explore the viability of very massive star core-collapse events as the origin of LFBOTs. The appeal of such a model is that the formation of massive black holes via core collapse may yield observational signatures that can match the disparate lines of evidence that point towards both core-collapse and tidal disruption origins for LFBOTs. We explore the formation rate of massive black holes in population synthesis models, and compare the metallicities of their progenitors with the observed metallicities of LFBOT host galaxies. We further examine the composition, mass loss rates and fallback masses of these stars, placing them in the context of LFBOT observations. The formation rate of black holes with mass greater than ~30-40Msol is similar to the observed LFBOT rate. The stars producing these black holes are biased to low metallicity (Z<0.3Zsol), are H and He-poor and have dense circumstellar media. However, some LFBOTs have host galaxies with higher metallicities than predicted, and others have denser environments (plausibly due to late mass loss not captured in the models). We find that long-lived emission from an accretion disc (as implicated in the prototypical LFBOT AT2018cow) can plausibly be produced in these events. We conclude that (very) massive star core-collapse is a plausible explanation for LFBOTs. The preferred progenitors for LFBOTs in this scenario overlap with those predicted to produce super-kilonovae. We therefore suggest that LFBOTs are promising targets to search for super-kilonovae, and that they may contribute non-negligibly to the r-process enrichment of galaxies.",

Webb 22 pages 14 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The XMM-Newton X-ray observatory has played a prominent role in astrophysics, conducting precise and thorough observations of the X-ray sky for the past two decades. The most recent iteration of the 4XMM catalogue and one of its latest data releases DR11 mark significant improvements over previous XMM-Newton catalogues, serving as a cornerstone for comprehending the diverse inhabitants of the X-ray sky. We employ detections and spectra extracted from the 4XMM-DR11 catalogue, subjecting them to fitting procedures using simple models. Our study operates within the framework of the XMM2ATHENA project, which focuses on developing state-of-the-art methods that exploit existing XMM-Newton data. We introduce and publicly release four catalogues containing measurements derived from X-ray spectral modelling of sources. The first catalogue encompasses outcomes obtained by fitting an absorbed power law model to all the extracted spectra for individual detections within the 4XMM-DR11 dataset. The second catalogue presents results obtained by fitting both an absorbed power law and an absorbed blackbody model to all unique physical sources listed in the 4XMM-DR11s catalogue, which documents source detection results from overlapping XMM-Newton observations. For the third catalogue we use the five band count rates derived from the pipe line detection of X-ray sources to mimic low resolution spectra to get a rough estimate of the spectral shape (absorbed power-law) of all 4XMM-DR11 detections. In the fourth catalogue, we conduct spectral analyses for the subset of identified sources with extracted spectra, employing various models based on their classification into categories such as AGN, stars, X-ray binaries, and cataclysmic variables. The scientific potential of these catalogues is highlighted by discussing the capabilities of optical and mid-infrared colours for selecting absorbed AGN. (abridged)",

These emissions are key signatures for detection by ground-based, sub-orbital, and satellite-based telescopes aiming to study high energy cosmic ray and neutrino events. However, detectors operating at ground and balloon altitudes are also exposed to a background of atmospheric charged particles, primarily pions, kaons, and muons, that can mimic or obscure the signals from astrophysical sources. In this work, we use coupled cascade equations to calculate the atmospheric pion, kaon and muon fluxes reaching detectors at various altitudes. Our analysis focuses on energies above 10 GeV, where the influence of the Earth's magnetic field on particle trajectories is minimal. We provide angular and energy-resolved flux estimates and discuss their relevance as background for extensive air shower detection. Our results are potentially relevant for interpreting data from current and future balloon-borne experiments such as EUSO-SPB2 and for refining trigger and veto strategies in Cherenkov and fluorescence telescopes.",

By solving the full set of GRMHD equations, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the behavior of magnetized plasma in the strong gravity regime near a rotating black hole. The accretion solutions are obtained for a set of input parameters, namely energy (${\\cal E}$), angular momentum (${\\cal L}$), magnetic flux ($\\Phi$), and isorotation parameter ($I$). By systematically varying these parameters, we generate a family of global GRMHD accretion solutions that characterize the physical environment around the black hole. Using this approach, we investigate whether the inferred magnetic field strengths reported by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) for Sagittarius A$^*$ at various radii can be reproduced. We find that, for a broad range of parameter values, our model successfully recovers the EHT inferred magnetic field strengths with an accuracy of approximately $10\\%$, offering a self-consistent framework for interpreting near-horizon accretion physics.",

It will consist of telescopes of three sizes, covering different parts of the large energy range. We report on the performance of Large-Sized Telescope prototype (LST-1) in the detection and characterization of extragalactic gamma-ray sources, with a focus on the reconstructed gamma-ray spectra and variability of classical bright BL Lacertae objects, which were observed during the early commissioning phase of the instrument. LST-1 data from known bright gamma-ray blazars - Markarian 421, Markarian 501, 1ES 1959+650, 1ES 0647+250, and PG 1553+113 - were collected between July 10, 2020, and May 23, 2022, covering a zenith angle range of 4 deg to 57 deg. The reconstructed light curves were analyzed using a Bayesian block algorithm to distinguish the different activity phases of each blazar. Simultaneous Fermi-LAT data were utilized to reconstruct the broadband $\\gamma$-ray spectra for the sources during each activity phase. High-level reconstructed data in a format compatible with gammapy are provided together with measured light curves and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for several bright blazars and an interpretation of the observed variability in long and short timescales. Simulations of historical flares are generated to evaluate the sensitivity of LST-1. This work represents the first milestone in monitoring bright BL Lacertae objects with a CTAO telescope.",

These observations are consistent with the shadow of a Kerr black hole in general relativity (GR). Observations of the shadow of SMBHs can be used to test modified gravity theories, including Yukawa gravity, in extremely strong fields. In this paper, we illustrate the shadows of Yukawa black holes, showing that their sizes are significantly influenced by the Yukawa parameters $\\lambda$ and $\\kappa$. Using the EHT observations of M87* and Sgr A*, we obtain constraints on the Yukawa parameters. For Sgr A*, Keck and VLTI provide different priors on its gravitational radius. The Sgr A* shadow yields $\\kappa=-0.04^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$ for $\\lambda>1$\\,AU with the Keck prior, while $\\kappa=-0.08^{+0.09}_{-0.06}$ with the VLTI prior. As $\\lambda$ decreases, the constraints weaken, reaching $-0.37<\\kappa <0.17$ (Keck prior) and $-0.47<\\kappa<0.04$ (VLTI prior) at $\\lambda=0.1$\\,AU. For M87*, with a mass significantly larger than Sgr A*, this system can only put constraints on $\\kappa$ at larger $\\lambda$. For $\\lambda>1.5\\times10^4$\\,AU, the \\textit{EHT} observation of M87* yields $\\kappa=-0.01^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$. No significant deviation from GR is detected in our analysis. Additionally, we explore potential constraints using the next-generation VLBI, like \\textit{ngEHT} and the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX), which promise the detection of the second ring of photons. The improved angular resolution and the measurements of the second ring could substantially refine constraints on the Yukawa parameters, enhancing our ability to test deviations from GR in the strong-field regime.",

While general consensus concludes the VHE emission originates from relativistic leptons accelerated by the PWN and undergoing inverse Compton scattering, questions remain about electron escape and propagation, as well as the evolutionary stage of this particular PWN. CTA 1 is on the cusp of middle age (~13 kyr) and spatially resolvable at energies visible to imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), such as the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) (PSF < 0.1 deg). Therefore, this remnant is an excellent candidate to study lepton propagation and escape between different PWN evolutionary stages. Since the initial VERITAS publication on CTA 1 in 2013, VERITAS has performed new observations, adding to a total exposure of about 120 hours. We have analyzed the entire VERITAS CTA 1 dataset to date and report results.",

Given enough time, supernova explosions within the jet will eventually happen, and may have a strong impact on its dynamics, potentially triggering powerful non-thermal activity. We carried out a detailed numerical study to explore the dynamics of the interaction between the ejecta of a supernova explosion and a relativistic extragalactic jet. By means of relativistic hydrodynamics simulations using the code RATPENAT, we simulated the jet-ejecta interaction in two different geometries or scenarios: a two-dimensional, axisymmetric simulation, and a three-dimensional one, which includes the orbital velocity of the exploding star. Although initially filling a region much smaller than the jet radius, the ejecta expands and eventually covers most of the jet cross section. The expansion is enhanced as more energy from the jet is converted into kinetic and internal energy of the ejecta, which also favors the ejecta disruption, all this occurring on timescales ~ 10^4 yr. Although a complete numerical convergence of the results is unattainable given the subsonic, turbulent nature of the interaction region, the simulations are consistent in their description of the gross morphological and dynamical properties of the interaction process. At the end of the simulations, the supernova ejecta has already partially mixed with the relativistic jet. The results also suggest that the jet-ejecta interaction may be a non-negligible non-thermal emitter. Moreover, due to efficient mixing, the interaction region can be a potential source of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays of heavy composition.",

For instance, the efficient acceleration of charged particles at supernova remnant shocks requires rapidly growing instabilities, so much so that none of the proposed processes seem sufficient to warrant acceleration to PeV energies. In this work, we investigate whether an acoustic instability triggered by the presence of a CR pressure gradient can lead to significant self-confinement of charged particles in the vicinity of shocks. We validate the expected growth rates and obtain the scale and energy of magnetic field perturbations induced by such system using magnetohydrodynamical simulations. Our results suggest a strong suppression of the diffusion coefficient for particles with Larmor radius around a thousandth of the precursor scale length.",

Zarka High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Low-frequency radio data improve the sensitivity of pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) to propagation effects such as dispersion measure (DM) variations, enabling better noise characterization essential for detecting the stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). We combined LOFAR (100-200 MHz) and NenuFAR (30-90 MHz) observations with the recent European and Indian PTA release (DR2new+) into a new dataset, DR2low, spanning ~11 years for 12 pulsars. DR2low allows updated noise models, increasing PTA sensitivity to the GWB. Using Libstempo and Enterprise, we applied standard noise models including red noise (RN) and time-variable DM (DMv) as power laws, and performed Bayesian model selection over RN, DMv, and an additional chromatic noise term (CN4). Compared to DR2new+, DR2low improves DM constraints and separates DM and RN contributions. We found that the RN is required in the final model for 10 out of 12 pulsars, compared to only 5 in the DR2new+ dataset. The improved sensitivity to plasma effects provided by DR2low also favors the identification of significant CN4 in eight pulsars, while none showed such evidence in DR2new+. The analysis also reveals unmodelled solar wind effects, particularly near solar conjunction, with residual delays absorbed into the DM component, highlighting the importance of accurately modelling the solar wind in PTA datasets.",

Several violent outbursts in X-rays and $\\gamma$-rays have been observed in the past, with intra-night variability in very-high-energy $\\gamma$-rays (VHE; E > 100 GeV) detected down to the minute timescale. The alternation of quiescent and enhanced states, observed with a tentative quasi-periodicity of 1.74 $\\pm$ 0.13 years in high-energy (HE; 100 MeV < E < 100 GeV) $\\gamma$-rays, makes this source a key target also for ground-based $\\gamma$-ray instruments and in particular for the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes. Its brightness, proximity, and well-determined redshift make this $\\gamma$-ray source a prime target for fundamental physics studies, including tests of Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV), searches for axion-like particles (ALPs), and constraints on the distribution of the extragalactic background light (EBL). In the last two years, PKS 2155-304 has been independently monitored by the Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes and the first Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) located at the Roque de Los Muchachos Observatory (La Palma, Spain). The observations were carried out at large zenith angles (LZA; ZA > 55°), and the VHE data have been complemented with simultaneous observations in HE $\\gamma$-rays (Fermi-LAT), X-rays (Swift-XRT) and optical wavelengths (ASAS-SN).",

Proceedings of the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2025) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are prominent sources in the very-high energy (VHE) gamma-ray sky, constituting the most numerous identified source class in the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey (HGPS). They are comprised of energetic particles originating from the pulsar and expanding into the surrounding medium. As such, PWNe are of very high scientific interest as PeVatron candidates, objects that could potentially accelerate particles up to PeV energies. Additionally other aspects of their acceleration mechanism are being actively investigated, such as the open question of whether they accelerate not only leptonic but also hadronic particles, and the details of their morphology and particle transport mechanism. As PWNe emit photons over a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum, multiwavelength (MWL) studies are crucial for the investigation and study of their emission. In this vein we present a joint eROSITA X-ray and H.E.S.S. gamma-ray study of the PWN MSH 15-52. We showcase our custom code for integrating the EDR and DR1 eROSITA data into the Gammapy framework, a python package optimised for the analysis of gamma-ray data. We present the first 3D (spatial and spectral) fit to eROSITA data by using Gammapy. We furthermore combine these data with the public H.E.S.S. gamma-ray observations of MSH 15-52, resulting in a joint physical fit of the underlying particle population, and a subsequent discussion of the physical implications of our results. Finally we give an outlook towards future efforts in MWL studies of PWNe and the broader context of MWL data analysis with Gammapy.",

We show that the analytical fits are in excellent agreement with the numerical solutions of full magnetohydrodynamical equations. Our approach allows setting easily different models for an emitting plasma number density. For example, we show that the equipartition number density ranges from several to tens of percent of a total number density. We show that the Doppler-corrected emissivity distribution behave in such a way that we may expect a limb brightened intensity pattern on a sub-parsec scale and a spine-brightened structure downstream.

Among various candidates, the weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) scenario stands out and is under extensive study. The detection of the hypothetical gamma-ray emission from WIMP annihilation could act as a direct probe of electroweak-scale interactions, complementing DM collider searches and other direct DM detection techniques. At very high energies (VHE), WIMP self-annihilation is expected to produce gamma rays together with other Standard Model particles. The galactic center (GC), due to its relative proximity to the Earth and its high expected DM density, is a prime target for monoenergetic line searches. IACTs have placed strong constraints on the DM properties at the GC, with the MAGIC providing the most stringent limits from 20 TeV to 100 TeV, exploiting large zenith angle (LZA) observations. However, the limited field of view (FoV) of the MAGIC telescopes (< 3.5° ) prevented a detailed study of the extended region around the GC in which an enhanced DM density is expected. The LST-1 of the CTAO, located at the Roque de Los Muchachos Observatory (La Palma, Spain), close to the MAGIC site, has been observing the GC since 2021. With its wide FoV of 4.5°, LST-1 could contribute significantly to the WIMPs search at the GC. The observations are performed at LZA (ZA > 58°), which, while required due to the source's low altitude, also optimizes the detection of gamma rays up to 100 TeV and beyond. We present a study of the systematic uncertainties in WIMP line emission searches with LST-1. Our work examines the instrument response functions for LZA observations, background rejection in monoscopic mode, and includes updated results from simulations, highlighting new methods for spectral line searches.",

Submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics. Comments are welcome! Abstract is abridged Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The observational properties of core-collapse supernovae (CC-SNe) are shaped by the envelopes of their progenitors. In massive binary systems, mass-transfer alters the pre-SN structures compared to single stars, leading to a diversity in SN explosions. Aims. We compute the distribution of CC-SN properties based on comprehensive detailed grids of single and binary stellar evolution models. We conduct a grid-based population synthesis to produce a synthetic population of CC-SNe, and compare it to observed SN samples. We also apply various explodability and merger criteria to our models. In line with earlier results, we identify interacting SN progenitors as those stars that undergo CC during or shortly after a Roche-lobe overflow phase. With an interacting binary fraction of 68%, our models predict two-thirds of all CC-SNe to be of Type IIP/L, and 1/3 of Type Ibc, in agreement with recent volume-limited SN surveys. We find that 76% of the Type Ibc SN progenitors took part in a previous binary mass transfer (mostly as mass donor), but also 63% of the Type IIP/L SN progenitors (mostly as mass gainers), yielding a much broader envelope mass distribution than expected from single stars. We find that mass-transfer induced interacting SNe make up ~5% of all CC-SNe, which is close to the observed fractions of Type IIn and Type Ibn SNe. When assuming a disk or toroidal CSM geometry for Type IIn SNe, our models predict a bimodal distribution of the radiated energies, similar to that deduced from observations. While we find the effect of binary evolution on the relative number of Type Ibc and Type IIP/L SNe to be moderate, it leads to lower average ejecta masses in Type Ibc and Type IIb SNe, and can lead to higher pre-SN masses in Type IIP/L SNe than single stars. Binary models are also able to reproduce the number and properties of interacting SNe.",

Published in Nature Astronomy High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Hypervelocity white dwarfs (HVWDs) are stellar remnants moving at speeds exceeding the Milky Way's escape velocity. The origins of the fastest HVWDs are enigmatic, with proposed formation scenarios facing challenges explaining both their extreme velocities and observed properties. Here we report a three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of a merger between two hybrid Helium-Carbon-Oxygen white dwarfs (HeCO WDs with masses of 0.69 and 0.62 M$_\\odot$). We find that the merger leads to a partial disruption of the secondary WD, coupled with a double-detonation explosion of the primary WD. This launches the remnant core of the secondary WD at a speed of $~2000$ km s$^{-1}$, consistent with observed HVWDs. The low mass of the ejected remnant and its heating from the primary WD's ejecta explain the observed luminosities and temperatures of hot HVWDs, which are otherwise difficult to reconcile with previous models (such as the D6). This discovery establishes a new formation channel for HVWDs and points to a previously unrecognized pathway for producing peculiar Type Ia supernovae and faint explosive transients.",

Recent observations by the X-ray polarimeter IXPE support the presence of turbulence, with varying conditions even in different regions of a same source. We model such emission, and in particular the degree of linear polarization, by using 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence simulations for the first time. Thanks to a novel accelerated version of the ECHO code, a series of 3D relativistic MHD simulations were performed assuming a relativistically hot plasma and various degrees of magnetization, mimicking different conditions encountered in synchrotron sources. Magnetic fluctuations at random directions with respect to a background field were initialized at large scales. After the full development of the turbulent cascade, the statistical properties of the plasma and of the synchrotron emission maps were analyzed. Turbulence rapidly relaxes to a sort of Alfvénic equilibrium and a Kolmogorov cascade with a slope of $-5/3$ soon develops, with differences depending on the initial ratio, $\\eta$, of magnetic fluctuations over the background field. Dissipation mostly occurs in thin current sheets, where (numerical) reconnection takes place and intermittency and deviation from isotropic Gaussian distributions are observed. Synthetic synchrotron maps and their statistical properties depend on $\\eta$ too, approaching analytical estimates for large $\\eta$. The integrated degree of linear polarization is found to cover the whole range of observed values in PWNe, and its dependence on the relative amplitude of turbulent fluctuations shows a good agreement with analytical estimates, even in the presence of anisotropy.",

Within a fermionic DM model that interacts only through gravitation, along with a well-constrained nuclear matter equation of state, we show that the simultaneous mass and radius measurement of PSRJ0740+6620 reduces the uncertainty of DM central energy density by more than 50\\% compared to the results obtained from using the two observables independently, while other DM parameters remain unconstrained. Additionally, we find that the DM fraction $f_D$ should be smaller than 2\\% when constrained by the observed NS maximum mass alone, and it could be even smaller than 0.3\\% with the simultaneous measurement of mass and radius, supporting the conclusion that only a small amount of DM exists in DM admixed neutron stars (DANS).",

Accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) As the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) measures increasingly faint sources, the need for precise polarimetry extraction becomes paramount. In addition to previously described neural-net (NN) weights, we introduce here point-spread function weights and particle background weights, which can be critical for faint sources. In some cases these can be augmented by time/phase and energy weights. We provide a publicly available analysis tool to incorporate these new weights, validate our method on simulated data, and test it on archival IXPE observations. Together these weights decrease the area of the polarization uncertainty contour by a factor of two compared to baseline IXPE analysis and will be essential for background-limited IXPE observations.",

The method is tuned for use with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and tested on archival observations from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-Sky MWA Extended Survey (GLEAM-X) in the 70--300 MHz range. The images are formed from model-subtracted visibilities, before applying three filters to the time series of each pixel in an image, with each filter designed to be sensitive to a different transient behaviour. Due to the nature of radio interferometry and the refraction of the fluctuating ionosphere, the vast majority of candidates at this stage are artefacts which we identify and remove using a set of flagging measures. Of the 336 final candidates, 7 were genuine transients; 1 new LPT, 1 new pulsar, and 5 known pulsars. The performance of the method is analysed by injecting modelled transient pulses into a subset of the observations and applying the method to the result.",

Lazarian Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We investigate the development of tearing-mode instability using the highest resolution two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of reconnecting current sheets on a uniform grid, for Lundquist numbers $10^3 \\le S \\le 2 \\times 10^5$. Although the tearing-mode instability is commonly thought to trigger a plasmoid cascade that enables fast reconnection - i.e., independent of $S$ - our results, in broad agreement with the recent findings of Morillo \\& Alexakis (2025), challenge this belief. We demonstrate a Sweet-Parker scaling of the reconnection rate $V_{\\text{rec}} \\sim S^{-1/2}$ up to Lundquist numbers $S \\sim 10^4$. For larger values, plasmoid formation sets in leading to a slight enhancement of the reconnection rate, $V_{\\text{rec}} \\sim S^{-1/3}$, consistent with the prediction from linear tearing mode induced reconnection, indicating that reconnection remains resistivity dependent, and therefore slow. In our simulations, the plasmoids do not form a cascade of mergers, as they are rapidly advected out of the reconnection layer. Our findings call for the revision of the role of plasmoid formation in 2D high Lundquist number magnetic reconnection. Even if future studies demonstrate that 2D plasmoid-reconnection becomes resistivity-independent at sufficiently large $S$, directly extending those results to 3D astrophysical environments is not justified, as in realistic circumstances, the increase of $S$ also raises the Reynolds number of the outflows, making it essential to account for the dominant role of turbulence.",

We use three such HVSs as dynamical tracers to constrain the past orbit of the LMC. Since each star was ejected at a finite time in the past, it must intersect the past position of the LMC's central black hole at its ejection time. We model the LMC's orbit under the influence of dynamical friction and extended mass distributions for both the LMC and the Milky Way, generating a large ensemble of orbital realizations. By evaluating which orbits intersect the back-integrated HVS trajectories, we compute posterior distributions over the LMC's orbital history. This approach provides significantly tighter constraints on the past motion of the LMC than previously possible. We find two previously published orbital models that are consistent with these new constraints: a first-passage trajectory from a self-consistent hydrodynamic simulation, and a second-passage trajectory from a collisionless N-body simulation. In parallel, we infer the present-day ejection site of the HVSs -- likely tracing the LMC's dynamical center and supermassive black hole -- independent of conventional methods.",

Submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We use constrained idealized simulations of the LMC/Milky Way interaction to determine if the size of the LMC's gaseous halo (Corona) can be used to distinguish between first and second passage models $-$ an orbital trajectory for the LMC in which it has just recently approached the Milky Way for the first time (first passage), or one in which it has had a previous pericenter (second passage). Using live circumgalactic gas particles combined with analytic dark matter potentials evolved to follow previously published orbital trajectories, we find that the first passage model is able to reproduce the observed velocity profile and column density profile of the present day LMC Corona. On the other hand, in a second passage scenario the longer interaction time leads to the velocities and column densities around the LMC at the present day being too low. Based on this observed velocity profile, recent works have found that the LMC's Corona has been truncated to 17$-$20 kpc, and we find truncation radii of $15.3\\pm 0.9$ kpc and $7.6\\pm 2.0$ kpc for the first and second passage models, respectively. Thus, based on the gas properties of the LMC's CGM at the present day, a second passage trajectory is disfavored.",

By leveraging multi-sightline galaxy survey data from the Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey (CUBS) and deep radio observations from the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS), we have established a sample of $\\approx6000$ spectroscopically identified galaxies in 11 distinct fields to constrain the neutral gas content at intermediate redshifts. The galaxies sample a broad range in stellar mass -- $8\\lesssim\\log{M_\\rm{star}/\\rm{M}_\\odot}\\lesssim11$ with a median of $\\langle\\log{M_\\rm{star}/\\rm{M}_\\odot}\\rangle_\\rm{med}\\approx10$ -- and a wide range in redshift -- $0.24\\lesssim z\\lesssim0.63$ with a median of $\\langle z\\rangle_\\rm{med}=0.44$. Our detected emission-line signal exceeds $4\\,\\sigma$ significance in the stacked spectra of all subsamples, and the observed total H I 21-cm line flux translates to a H I mass $M_\\rm{H\\;I}\\approx10^{10}\\rm{M}_\\odot$. We find a high H I-to-stellar mass ratio of $M_\\mathrm{H\\;I}/M_\\rm{star}\\approx6$ for low-mass galaxies with $\\langle\\log{M_\\rm{star}/\\rm{M}_\\odot}\\rangle \\approx9.3$ ($>3.7\\,\\sigma$).

Additionally, the redshift evolution of H I mass in both low- and high-mass field galaxies, inferred from the stacked emission-line signal, aligns well with the expectation from the cosmic star formation history. This suggests that the overall decline in the cosmic star formation activity across the general galaxy population may be connected to a decreasing supply of neutral hydrogen. Finally, our analysis has revealed significant 21-cm signals at distances greater than 75 kpc from these intermediate-redshift galaxies, indicating a substantial reservoir of H I gas in their extended surroundings.",

In this study, we employ the TNG300 simulation to investigate the prospect of recovering the dark matter distribution of galaxy clusters from deep, wide-field optical images. For this, we generate mock observations of 40 massive clusters ($M_{200}\\gtrsim 10^{14.5}\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$) at $z=0.06$ for the $g'$ band of the Wendelstein Wide-Field Imager (WWFI), and isolate the emission from the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the ICL by masking the satellite galaxies, following observational procedures. By comparing $\\Sigma_{\\rm BCG+ICL}$ profiles from these images against $\\Sigma_{\\rm DM}$ profiles for the central subhaloes, we find that $\\Sigma_{\\rm cen-DM}/\\Sigma_{\\rm BCG+ICL}$ exhibits a quasi-linear scaling relation in log space with the normalised distance $r/R_{\\Delta}$, for both $R_{\\Delta}=R_{200}$ and $R_{500}$. The scatter in the scaling is predominantly stochastic, showing a weak dependence on formation time and dynamical state. We recover the DM concentration and mass within $\\approx 23$ and $\\approx 15$ per cent of their true values (for $R_{200}$), respectively, and with $\\approx 3$ per cent larger uncertainties for $R_{500}$. Alternatively, we find that the concentration can be estimated using the BCG+ICL fraction, the central's DM mass using the BCG+ICL flux, and the total DM mass using the bolometric flux. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deriving dark matter characteristics of galaxy clusters to be observed with facilities like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in the near future.",

Fernández-López, N. Castro-Toledo, R. Veyry, G. Bernal-Mesina Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) (abridged) We aim to characterize kinematic processes in the G012.80 protocluster. We principally focus on the N$_2$H$^+$(1$-$0) emission to trace the dense and cold gas. Additionally, we use lines such as DCN(3$-$2), H41$\\alpha$, C$^{18}$O(1$-$0), and SiO(5$-$4), as well as continuum maps. We perform a N$_2$H$^+$ hyperfine spectral line fitting to analyze multiple velocity components and spectral parameters. We estimate velocity gradients, column densities, and line-mass profiles for the two main filaments in G012, named R1 and R2. Line-mass profiles follow $\\lambda$($\\omega$) = 5660 M$_{\\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$($\\omega$/pc)$^{0.30}$ (R1) and $\\lambda$($\\omega$) = 6943 M$_{\\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$($\\omega$/pc)$^{0.20}$ (R2), which are much larger than those of typical low-mass filaments. R1 and R2 show disparate position-velocity (PV) features. R1 exhibits a transverse velocity gradient of 10.4 kms$^{-1} $pc$^{-1}$ and few dense cores. This gradient is interpreted with a simple rotation toy model, combined with line-mass profile, and corresponds to a rotational timescale of 0.1 Myr. In contrast, R2 exhibits compact velocity structures ($\\Delta$V < 2 kms$^{-1}$), likely due to collapse, as evidenced by the presence of a comparatively large number of massive cores and protostellar outflows. R2 is forming prestellar and protostellar cores at a rate of 55.3 M$_{\\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$, with an efficiency similar to the Orion Integral Shaped Filament (ISF). The R1 filament, in contrast, lacks protostellar cores and only contains a few prestellar cores, resulting in an estimated SFR of 4.2 M$_{\\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$, more than an order of magnitude below that of R2. Combining these lines of evidence, we suggest that R1 is younger and still rotating, while R2 has evolved to collapse with a higher SFR. G012 thus hosts filaments at different evolutionary stages.",

In this work, we extend the consideration of the merger fraction from the standard measure of binary mergers, namely those comprising two merging galaxies, to multiple mergers, namely mergers involving three or more galaxies. We use the Illustris and IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to provide a theoretical prediction for the fraction of galaxy systems that are involved in a multiple merger as a function of various parameters, with a focus on the relationship between the multiple merger fraction $f_m$ and the total merger fraction $f_t$. We generally find that binary mergers dominate the total fraction and that $f_m\\approx (0.5-0.7)f_t^{5/3}$, a prediction that can be tested observationally. We further compare the empirical simulation results with toy models where mergers occur, on the evolution timeline of a galaxy, either at constant intervals or as a Poisson process at a constant rate. From these comparisons, where the toy models typically produce lower multiple merger fractions, we conclude that in cosmological simulations, mergers are more strongly clustered in time than in these toy scenarios, likely reflecting the hierarchical nature of cosmological structure formation.",

Such multiphase flows -- involving gas at different temperatures, densities, and ionization states -- for instance, galactic winds, are frequently turbulent. However, idealized simulations typically model the winds and driven turbulence separately, despite their intertwined roles in galaxy evolution. To address this, we investigate the survival of a dense cloud in a hot wind subject to continuous external turbulent forcing. We perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations across a range of turbulent Mach numbers in the hot phase $\\mathcal{M}_{\\rm turb}=v_{\\rm turb}/c_{\\rm s, wind}$ from 0.1 to 0.7 ($c_{\\rm s, wind}$ and $v_{\\rm turb}$ being the sound speed and the turbulent velocity in the hot phase, respectively). We find that in spite of the additional subsonic turbulence, cold clouds can survive if the cooling time of the mixed gas $t_{\\rm cool, mix}$ is shorter than a modified destruction time $\\tilde{t}_{\\rm cc}$, i.e., $t_{\\rm cool,mix}/\\tilde{t}_{\\rm cc}<1$ where $\\tilde{t}_{\\rm cc}=t_{\\rm cc}/(1+\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{\\rm turb}/\\left(f_{\\rm mix}\\mathcal{M}_{\\rm wind}\\right)\\right)^2)^{1/2}$, where $f_{\\rm mix}\\sim0.6$ is a fudge factor. Moreover, in the `survival regime', turbulence can enhance the growth of cold clouds by up to an order of magnitude because of more efficient stretching and an associated increase in the surface area. This increase in mass transfer between the phases leads to significantly faster entrainment of cold material in turbulent winds. In contrast to the narrow filamentary tails formed in laminar winds, turbulence stretches the cold gas orthogonally, dispersing it over a larger area and changing absorption line signatures.",

      "abstract": "A systematic study on the properties of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon dust in active galactic nuclei with AKARI near-infrared spectroscopy Risako Katayama, Hidehiro Kaneda, Takuma Kokusho, Tsubasa Kondo, Shinki Oyabu, Toyoaki Suzuki, Takuro Tsuchikawa Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Recent near- and mid-infrared (IR) observations reveal the existence of appreciable amounts of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon dust in the harsh environments of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the origins of which are still under discussion. In this paper, we analyze the near-IR spectra of AGNs obtained with AKARI to systematically study the properties of the aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon dust a ected by the AGN activity. We perform the spectral fitting and the spectral energy distribution fitting for our sample of 102 AGNs to obtain the fluxes of the aromatic and aliphatic spectral features, the total IR luminosity (L_IR), and the fractional luminosity of AGN components (L_AGN/L_IR). As a result, we find that L_aromatic/L_IR is systematically lower for the AGN sample, especially much lower for AGNs with the aliphatic feature seen in the absorption, than for star-forming galaxies (SFGs), while L_aliphatic/L_aromatic is systematically higher for the AGN sample than for the SFG sample, increasing with the AGN activity indicated by L_AGN/L_IR. In addition, the profiles of the aliphatic emission features of the AGN sample are significantly di erent from those of the SFG sample in that the AGNs have the feature intensities systematically stronger at longer wavelengths. We conclude that both aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon dust are likely of circumnuclear origins, suggesting that a significant amount of the aliphatic hydrocarbon dust may come from a new population created through processes such as shattering of large carbonaceous grains by AGN outflows.",

To appear in the Proceedings of IAU Symposium 398 and MODEST-25: \"Compact Objects and Binaries in Dense Stellar Systems\" (Seoul, South Korea, June 2025) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Dense star clusters are promising nurseries for the formation and growth of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; $\\sim 10^2-10^5\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$), with increasing observational evidence pointing to their presence in massive star clusters and stripped dwarf-galaxy nuclei. During the early evolution of compact clusters, massive stars can rapidly segregate to the center, where frequent collisions may trigger the runaway growth of a very massive star (VMS). This object can subsequently collapse to form an IMBH or merge with a stellar-mass black hole. We carried out direct $N$-body and Monte Carlo simulations of star clusters with initial core densities between $10^6$ to $4\\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}\\,\\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$ and total masses of $5.9\\times 10^5$ and $1.3\\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$. These models show that IMBHs of $10^3-10^4\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ can form within $\\leq 5$ Myr through the runaway collision channel. At later times, the IMBHs continue to grow through mergers with black holes, stars, and compact remnants, providing predictions testable with future gravitational-wave and transient surveys.",

Accepted for publication in AJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Methanol (CH$_{3}$OH) ice is abundant in space and is a key feedstock for seeding chemical complexity in interstellar and circumstellar environments. Despite its ubiquity, gas-phase methanol has only been detected in one disk around a Solar-type star to date, TW Hya. Here we present new high sensitivity (~1 mJy/beam) observations of TW Hya with ALMA that detect four individual transitions of gas-phase methanol spanning upper level energies from 17 to 38 K. We confirm the presence of gas-phase methanol in the luke-warm molecular layer of the disk ($35.9^{+25.9}_{-10.6}$ K) and with a disk-integrated column density of $1.8^{+1.3}_{-0.5}\\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. A radially-resolved analysis suggests that the gas-phase methanol is centrally compact, peaking within the spatial extent of the mm-sized dust grains ($\\lesssim 80$ au). Static gas-grain chemical disk models confirm photodesorption as an important mechanism releasing methanol into the gas phase, with the column density further boosted by the inclusion of grain-surface chemistry, reactive desorption, and an increase in dust-grain surface area assuming fractal grains. However, no model can fully reproduce the observed column density nor the radial distribution, and we suggest that the inclusion of dynamic processes such as vertical mixing and radial drift would be required to do so. Our results demonstrate that the abundance and distribution of the precursors for complex chemistry in the planet-forming regions around Solar-type stars is ultimately controlled by the interplay of grain surface chemistry coupled with the evolution of dust in their disks.",

Focusing on galaxies that experienced a major merger, we identify a characteristic azimuthal misalignment between the warp structures of stellar populations formed before and after the merger. This misalignment persists even after correcting for differential rotation, suggesting it is a dynamical imprint of the merger rather than a consequence of internal kinematics. In contrast, galaxies without significant merger events show no such offset between stellar populations of different ages. These findings support the scenario in which mergers can induce long-lived warps and leave detectable structural signatures in stellar disks. Applied to the Milky Way, this approach offers a potential way to test whether the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus merger contributed to the formation of the Galactic warp. It may also provide an independent means to constrain the timing of such merger events by examining the phase offsets in the stellar warp as a function of stellar age.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The role of spiral arms in galaxies -- whether they enhance star formation efficiency or primarily act as material gatherers -- remains an open question. Observational studies have yielded ambiguous results, in part due to the choice of star formation rate (SFR) tracers and their inherent limitations. These limitations are addressed here by applying multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to individual arm and interarm regions. We expand on our previous study of two galaxies to include six diverse galaxies, spanning over an order of magnitude in total stellar mass and factors of several in total SFR, for which spiral arms have been mapped. We find that the specific star formation rate (sSFR = SFR/M$_{star}$) can be used as a proxy for the star formation efficiency (SFE=SFR/M$_{gas}$), since the two quantities are directly proportional to each other in our regions. In our analysis of both tracers (sSFR and SFE) no significant difference is found the between arm and interarm regions, except for one galaxy (NGC 1097), supporting the gatherers scenario.",

Valenzuela, Rhea-Silvia Rhemus, Joel L. Pfeffer, Klaus Dolag 14 pages, 7 figures, Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics; Abstract slightly shortened for Arxiv Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) There is increasing observational evidence for a failed galaxy formation pathway for some ultradiffuse galaxies (UDGs) at low redshift however they currently lack simulated counterparts. We attempt to identify dark matter halos at high redshift within the MAGNETICUM cosmological simulations that could plausibly be their progenitors. We build a toy model of passive galaxy evolution within the stellar mass-halo mass relation to trace z = 0 observations of UDGs back to their z = 2 locations. We identify a population of 443 galaxies that match these parameter space positions within the simulation. We build two comparison samples within the simulation that follow the stellar mass-halo mass relationship at z = 2, one of which is stellar mass matched (with varying smaller halo masses) and the other is halo mass matched (with varying larger stellar masses) to our sample. We identify that our failed galaxy progenitor candidates have 1) flatter, cored dark matter halos; 2) more extended stellar bodies; 3) a larger fraction of their gas in the outskirts of their halos; 4) lower metallicities and 5) higher star formation rates than the control samples. Findings 1) and 2) are similar to low redshift observations of UDGs. Finding 3) will aid the removal of gas and permanent quenching of star formation which is a requirement of the failed galaxy formation scenario. The low metallicities of finding 4) match those observed in low redshift failed galaxy UDGs. Comparing the high star formation rates of finding 5) to recent JWST observations suggests that a starburst would naturally explain the high globular cluster richness of the UDGs. Many of the properties we find for these failed galaxy progenitors can be explained by an assembly bias of their dark matter halo to later formation times. We conclude by proposing that the fraction of failed galaxy UDGs is expected to increase with environmental density.",

Accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We aim to spectroscopically confirm the nature of VVV-J181258.71-314346.7, a candidate counterpart to the unassociated gamma-ray source 4FGLJ1812.8-3144. This object was selected based on its near-infrared photometric properties and moderate variability, as part of a broader effort to identify active galactic nuclei (AGN) behind the Galactic bulge and disc. We obtained near-infrared spectra using the Flamingos-2 instrument at Gemini South, covering the $1.1 $--$ 1.8~\\mu$m range with a spectral resolution of $R \\sim 1200$. Standard data reduction procedures were applied, including telluric correction and wavelength calibration. The analysis focused on the identification of emission lines and the estimation of the redshift using cross-correlation techniques and spectral template fitting. Despite a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio, the spectrum reveals the presence of Pa$\\beta$ and Fe\\,\\textsc{ii} emission lines. The measured redshift is $z = 0.206 \\pm 0.001$, which confirms the extragalactic nature of the source. The spectral features such as line ratios and full width at half maximum are consistent with those typically observed in type-1 AGNs, particularly Seyfert 1 galaxies. This study demonstrates the ability of near-infrared spectroscopy to reveal AGNs that are obscured by highly extincted and crowded galactic fields. The confirmation of an AGN at low Galactic latitude ($b\\sim -6.5$°) shows that near-IR surveys like VVV can successfully penetrate the zone of avoidance. Extending this approach to additional candidates is crucial for improving the census of AGNs hidden behind the Milky Way, as well as for constraining the population of unassociated gamma-ray sources in these troublesome regions.",

The sample spans a wide mass range, from M500 about 2x10^13 to 7x10^14 solar masses, and includes well-studied systems such as Coma, Perseus, and Virgo. We carefully modeled all background components, including the soft X-ray foregrounds (the Local Hot Bubble, Milky Way Halo, and super-virial temperature components), the cosmic X-ray background, and the non-X-ray background, and assessed their effects on the derived properties of the intracluster medium (ICM). We constructed radial profiles of emission measure, electron density, and temperature. Temperatures decrease smoothly with radius, typically dropping to about one-third to half of their peak values near r200. For relaxed clusters, the emission measure profiles outside the core regions are well described by a beta model with beta around 0.6-0.7, while groups show slightly flatter slopes of beta around 0.4-0.65. Beyond r2500, electron density profiles follow a power-law decline with a slope close to 2. At r500 and r200, the electron density and the gas mass fraction show a tight correlation with the system mass, except for three clusters with bright subclusters. In massive clusters, the gas fraction increases with radius and approaches the cosmic baryon fraction near r200. In contrast, lower-mass systems exhibit gas fractions of around 0.1 at r200. The observed mass dependence of gas fractions suggests that feedback and related processes play an increasingly important role toward the group scale, shaping the connection between baryons and dark matter halos.",

We took simultaneous deep X-ray observations of PG0043+039 with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR, UV spectra with the HST, and optical spectra with the HET telescope in 2022. PG0043+039 was an extreme low-X-ray-luminosity quasar in 2022. This AGN showed an extreme steep alpha_oX value of -2.47. The X-ray luminosity was a factor of 3.4 higher in the meantime in 2013. The optical and UV continuum only decreased by a factor of 1.3 - 1.5 from 2013 to 2022. Very strong emission-line intensity variations by factors of eight or more were observed in the OVI_1038 and SiIV_1403 lines between 2013 and 2022. The other UV emission lines such as Ly_alpha only decreased by a factor of 1.4. We derived a black hole mass of M=6.95*10^{8} M_solar (based on H_beta). This corresponds to an Eddington ratio of L/L_edd = 0.115. PG0043+039 exhibits strong and broad absorption lines in the UV. The highly ionized absorption lines show the largest velocity blueshifts in their broad absorption lines. The PV absorption is very strong, with equivalent widths of 7 - 10 AA. PG0043+039 shows strong Ly_alpha emission despite strong PV absorption.

We found no general correlations of X-ray/opt/UV continuum variations with the broad absorption line variations. However, based on the simultaneous UV and X-ray observations - taken in 2013 and 2022 - we see higher maximum velocities of the blueshifted broad absorption lines in the UV when the X-ray flux was lower.",

We use a Simulation Based Inference framework to constrain properties of the MW, LMC and the induced reflex motion using the dynamics of outer MW halo stars. Specifically, we use the mean radial and tangential velocities of outer halo stars calculated in a set of distance and on-sky bins. We train neural networks to estimate parameter posterior distributions using a set of $128,000$ rigid MW--LMC simulations conditioned upon velocity data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the combined H3+SEGUE+MagE outer halo surveys. We constrain the reflex motion velocity and the enclosed MW and LMC masses within $50 \\, \\rm kpc$ using the DESI or H3+SEGUE+MagE dataset while varying the survey sky coverage and depth. We find the most precise constraints by using the radial and tangential velocity data from the H3+SEGUE+MagE survey and on-sky quadrant sky coverages. We report a reflex motion velocity, the speed at which the MW lurches towards the LMC, of $v_{\\rm{travel}} = 26.4^{+5.5}_{-4.4} \\, \\rm km \\, \\rm s^{-1}$, while simultaneously finding an enclosed LMC mass of $M_{\\rm LMC}(< 50 \\, \\rm kpc) = 9.2^{+1.9}_{-2.3} \\times 10^{10}\\, \\rm M_{\\odot}$ and enclosed MW mass of $M_{\\rm MW}(< 50 \\, \\rm kpc) = 4.4^{+0.7}_{-0.7} \\times 10^{11}\\, \\rm M_{\\odot}$. Our results suggest that the LMC's total mass is at least $\\approx 10-15 \\%$ of that of the MW. This inference framework is flexible such that it can provide rapid and reliable constraints when applied to any future survey measuring the velocities of outer halo stars.",

Oesch, Romain Meyer, Rui Marques-Chaves, Seiji Fujimoto Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We use the ultra-deep GLIMPSE JWST/NIRCam survey to constrain the faint-end of the H$\\beta$+[OIII]$\\lambda\\lambda$4960,5008 luminosity function (LF) down to $10^{39}$ erg/s at z=7-9 behind the lensed Hubble Frontier Field Abell S1063. We perform SED fitting on a Lyman-Break Galaxy sample, measuring combined H$\\beta$+[OIII] fluxes to construct the emission-line LF. The resulting LF ($\\alpha$=-1.55 to -1.78) is flatter than the UV LF ($\\alpha<-2$), indicating a lower number density of low H$\\beta$+[OIII] emitters at fixed MUV. We explore three explanations: (i) bursty star formation histories reducing the H$\\beta$+[OIII]-to-UV ratio, (ii) metallicity effects on [OIII]/H$\\beta$, or (iii) a faint-end turnover in the UV LF. Assuming an evolving [OIII]/H$\\beta$ ratio, we derive a flatter [OIII]$\\lambda$5008 LF ($\\alpha$=-1.45 to -1.66) and a steeper H$\\beta$ LF ($\\alpha$=-1.68 to -1.95). The combination of decreasing metallicity and bursty star formation can reconcile the UV and H$\\beta$+[OIII] LF differences. Converting the LF to the ionising photon production rate, we find that galaxies with H$\\alpha$ flux $>10^{39}$ erg/s (SFR(H$\\alpha$)$>5\\times10^{-3} M_\\odot$/yr) contribute 21-61% and 24-104% of the ionising photon budget at 7<z<8 and 8<z<9, respectively (for $f_{esc}=0.1$). The LF shape suggests faint galaxies contribute minimally to the ionising photon production rate. Our cosmic star formation rate density (CSFRD) estimates align with previous work, but GLIMPSE's sensitivity to low SFRs confirms that very faint galaxies are minor contributors to both the ionising photon production rate and the CSFRD. Our results suggest that GLIMPSE has detected the bulk of the total H$\\beta$+[OIII] emission from star-forming galaxies, with fainter sources playing a limited role in cosmic reionisation.",

Koch 13 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Here we use data from multi-scale galactic MHD simulations to observe filaments and star forming clumps on 10's of pc scales and investigate flow rate relationships along, and onto filaments as well as flows towards the clumps. Using the FilFinderPPV identification technique, we identify the prominent filamentary structures in each data cube. Each filament and its corresponding clump are analysed by calculating flow rates along each filament towards the clump, onto each filament from increasing distances, and radially around each clump. This analysis is conducted for two cubes, one feedback dominated region, and one with less feedback. Looking at the face-on inclination of the simulations (0 degrees), we observe different trends depending on the environmental conditions (more or less feedback). The median flow rate in the region with more feedback is 8.9$\\times$10$^{-5}$ M$_{sun}\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and we see that flow rates along the filaments toward the clumps generally decrease in these regions. In the region with less feedback we have a median flow rate of 2.9$\\times$10$^{-4}$ M$_{sun}\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and when looking along the filaments here we see the values either increase or remain constant. We find that the flow rates from the environments onto the primary filaments are of an order of magnitude sufficient to sustain the flow rates along these filaments. When discussing the effects of galactic and filamentary inclination, we also observe that viewing the filaments from different galactic inclinations can reveal the presence of feeder structures (smaller filamentary structures aiding in the flow of material). The method used to estimate these flow rates, which has been previously applied to observational data, produced results consistent with those obtained from the simulations themselves, providing high confidence in the flow rate calculation method.",

Edge-on disks offer a unique opportunity to directly examine their vertical structure, providing valuable insights into planet formation processes. We investigate the dust properties, as well as the CO and HCO$^+$ gas properties, in the edge-on disk surrounding the T Tauri star 2MASS J04202144+281349 (SSTTau042021). Aims. We estimate the radial and vertical temperature and density profile for the gas and the dust. Methods. We use ALMA archival data of CO isotopologues and continuum emission at 2, 1.3 and 0.9 mm together with new NOEMA HCO$^+$ 3-2 observations. We retrieve the gas and dust disk properties using the tomographic method and the \\textsc{DiskFit} model. Results. The vertical CO emission appears very extended, partly tracing the H$_2$ wind observed by JWST. C$^{18}$O, $^{13}$CO and HCO$^+$ emission characterize the bulk of the molecular layer. The dust and gas have a mid-plane temperatures of $\\sim 7-11$ K. The temperature of the molecular layer (derived from $^{13}$CO and HCO$^+$) is on the order of 16 K. HCO$^+$ 3-2 being thermalized, we derive a lower limit for the H$_2$ volume density of $\\sim 3 \\times 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ at radius 100-200 au between 1 and 2 scale heights. The atmosphere temperature of the CO gas is of the order $\\sim$ 31 K at a radius of 100 au. We directly observe CO and HCO$^+$ gas onto the mid-plane beyond the dust outer radius ($\\ge 300$ au). The (gas+dust) disk mass estimated up to a radius of 300 au is on the order of $4.6 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. Conclusions. Thanks to the favorable disk inclination, we present the first quantitative evidence for vertical molecular stratification with direct observation of CO and HCO$^+$ gas along the mid-plane. We estimate the temperature profile with temperature of 7-11 K near the mid-plane, and 15-20 K in the dense part of the molecular layer up to $\\sim$ 35 K above.",

Dobrovolskas Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Aims. We have determined Sr abundance in a sample of 31 red giant branch stars located in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tuc with the aim to identify potential differences in the Sr abundance between first population (1P, Na-poor) and second population (2P, Na-rich) stars. Methods. We derived the Na and Sr abundances from the archival spectra obtained with the UVES spectrograph. To do this, we used 1D ATLAS9 model atmospheres and a 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium spectral synthesis method. Particular attention was paid to assessing the potential impact of CN line blending on the obtained Sr abundances. Furthermore, we evaluated the potential influence of convection on the Sr line formation by using 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres computed with the CO5BOLD code. Results. Our results suggest a weak correlation between the abundances of Sr and Na. Together with a similar correlation between the abundances of Zr and Na determined in our previous study, our analysis of Sr suggests that polluters that have enriched 2P stars with light elements may have produced some s-process elements as well. The mean Sr abundance determined in 31 red giant branch stars of 47~Tuc is $\\langle {\\rm [Sr/Fe]} \\rangle = 0.18\\pm0.08$ (the error denotes the standard deviation due to the star-to-star abundance scatter). This value is within the range of the Sr abundance variation that is observed in Galactic field stars of similar metallicity. The mean [Sr/Zr] abundance ratio in our sample stars suggests that the two s-process elements could have been synthesized by either low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars ($M=1-4 {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$) or massive ($M=10-20 {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$) fast-rotating ($v_{\\rm rot}=200-300$ km/s) stars.",

Peng, Kaixiang Wang, Laura Ferrarese, Patrick Côté Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Galaxy model subtraction removes the smooth light of nearby galaxies so that fainter sources (e.g., stars, star clusters, background galaxies) can be identified and measured. Traditional approaches (isophotal or parametric fitting) are semi-automated and can be challenging for large data sets. We build a convolutional denoising autoencoder (DAE) for galaxy model subtraction: images are compressed to a latent representation and reconstructed to yield the smooth galaxy, suppressing other objects. The DAE is trained on GALFIT-generated model galaxies injected into real sky backgrounds and tested on real images from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS). To quantify performance, we conduct an injection-recovery experiment on residual images by adding mock globular clusters (GCs) with known fluxes and positions. Our tests confirm a higher recovery rate of mock GCs near galaxy centers for complex morphologies, while matching ellipse fitting for smooth ellipticals. Overall, the DAE achieves subtraction equivalent to isophotal ellipse fitting for regular ellipticals and superior results for galaxies with high ellipticities or spiral features. Photometry of small-scale sources on DAE residuals is consistent with that on ellipse-subtracted residuals. Once trained, the DAE processes an image cutout in $\\lesssim 0.1$ s, enabling fast, fully automatic analysis of large data sets. We make our code available for download and use.",

Enßlin, Philipp Frank, Ralf Kissmann, Vo Hong Minh Phan, Andrés Ramírez, Hanieh Zandinejad, Philipp Mertsch 20 pages, 22 figures, accepted by A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The spatial distribution of the gaseous components of the Milky Way is of great importance for a number of different fields, for example, Galactic structure, star formation, and cosmic rays. However, obtaining distance information to gaseous clouds in the interstellar medium from Doppler-shifted line emission is notoriously difficult given our vantage point in the Galaxy. It requires spatial knowledge of gas velocities and generally suffers from distance ambiguities. Previous works often assumed the optically thin limit, had a fixed velocity field, and lacked resolution overall. We aim to overcome these issues and improve previous reconstructions of the gaseous constituents of the interstellar medium of the Galaxy. We used 3D Gaussian processes to model correlations in the interstellar medium, including correlations between different lines of sight, and enforce a spatially coherent structure in the prior. For modelling the transport of radiation from the emitting gas to us as observers, we took absorption effects into account. A special numerical grid ensures that there is high resolution nearby. We inferred the spatial distributions of atomic hydrogen (HI), carbon monoxide (CO), their emission line widths, and the Galactic velocity field in a joint Bayesian inference. We further constrained these fields with complementary data from Galactic masers and young stellar object clusters. Our main result consists of a set of samples that implicitly contain statistical uncertainties. The resulting maps are spatially coherent and reproduce the data with high fidelity. We confirm previous findings regarding the warping and flaring of the Galactic disc. A comparison with 3D dust maps reveals a good agreement on scales larger than approximately 400 pc. While our results are not free of artefacts, they present a big step forward in obtaining high-quality 3D maps of the interstellar medium.",

Martínez 27 pages, lots of love and figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Lyman-Alpha (Lya) photons emitted in star-forming regions inside galaxies experience a complex radiative transfer process until they reach the observer. The Lya line profile that we measured on Earth is, thus, the convolution of the gas properties in the interstellar (ISM), circumgalactic (CGM), and intergalactic medium (IGM). We make use of the open source package zELDA (redshift Estimator for Line profiles of Distant Lyman-Alpha emitters) to disentangle the galactic and IGM components of the Lya profiles to study both the evolution of the intrinsic galactic emission and the IGM transmission across cosmic time. zELDA includes different artificial neural networks that reconstruct IGM attenuated Lya line profiles. These models are trained using mock Lya line profiles. A Monte Carlo radiative transfer code computes the galactic component for the so-called thin shell model. Moreover, the IGM component is included through the IGM transmission curves generated from the IllustrisTNG100 cosmological galaxy formation simulation. We recover their intrinsic galactic spectra by applying the zELDA to 313 Lya line profiles observed with HST/COS and MUSE. Sources at z < 0.5 show weak IGM attenuation, while at z > 3, ZELDA reveals significant IGM suppression of the blue peak in several sources. After separating the IGM effects, the stacked intrinsic galactic Lya profiles show a minimal evolution from z = 0 to 6. The mean IGM transmission for z < 0.5 in HST/COS data exceeds 90%, while the MUSE data show an evolution from 0.85 at z = 3.0 to 0.55 at z = 5.0.",

Hence, understanding galaxies' dust properties across cosmic time is critical to studying their evolution. In addition to photometric constraints on the absorption of blue light and its reemission at infrared wavelengths, dust grain properties can be explored spectroscopically via polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission bands in the mid-IR. The new SPHEREx space telescope conducts an all-sky spectrophotometric survey of stars and galaxies at wavelengths of 0.75-5$\\,\\mu$m, making it ideal for studying the widespread presence of the 3.3$\\,\\mu$m PAH emission across galaxy populations out to z ~ 0.4. In this paper, we simulated galaxy spectra to investigate SPHEREx's capability to study PAH emission in such galaxies. We find that for the all-sky survey the PAH 3.3$\\,\\mu$m emission band flux can be measured to 30% accuracy at $\\log(\\rm M/{\\rm M_\\odot})>9.5$ and star formation rate (SFR) $> 1\\,{\\rm M_\\odot\\,yr^{-1}}$ at $z=0.1$, $\\log(\\rm M/{\\rm M_\\odot}) > 10.5$ and ${\\rm SFR} > 10\\,{\\rm M_\\odot\\,yr^{-1}}$ at $z=0.2-0.3$, and $\\log(\\rm M/{\\rm M_\\odot})>11$ and ${\\rm SFR} > 100\\,{\\rm M_\\odot\\,yr^{-1}}$ at $z=0.4$. For deep SPHEREx fields, a factor of ~10 deeper sensitivity limits can be reached. Overall, SPHEREx will enable the measurement of the 3.3$\\,\\mu$m PAH band emission in several hundred thousand galaxies across the sky, providing a population study of the smallest dust grains (\"nano grains\") and radiation properties in massive galaxies in the nearby Universe.",

Zavala Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The relative fraction of obscured galaxies at $z>4$ compared to lower redshifts remains highly uncertain as accurate bookkeeping of the dust-obscured component proves difficult. We address this shortcoming with SCUBADive, a compilation of the JWST counterparts of (sub-)millimeter galaxies in COSMOS-Web, in order to further analyze the distribution and properties of massive dust-obscured galaxies at early times. In this paper, we present a subset of SCUBADive, focusing on 60 ``dark'' galaxies that dropout at 1.5\\micron. Motivated by JWST observations of AzTECC71, a far-infrared bright F150W-dropout with $z_{\\rm phot}=5.7^{+0.8}_{-0.7}$, we complete a systematic search of F150W-dropouts with SCUBA-2 and ALMA detections to find more candidate high redshift dusty galaxies. Within our subsample, 16 are most similar to AzTECC71 due to fainter F444W magnitudes ($>24$\\,mag) and lack of counterparts in COSMOS2020. Despite high star formation rates ($\\langle$SFR$\\rangle=450^{+920}_{-320}$\\,\\mdot\\,yr$^{-1}$) and large stellar masses ($\\langle$log$_{10}$(\\mstar)$\\rangle=11.2^{+0.5}_{-0.6}$\\,\\mdot) on average, these galaxies may not be particularly extreme for their presumed epochs according to offsets from the main sequence. We find that heavily obscured galaxies, which would be missed by pre-JWST optical imaging campaigns, comprise $\\gtrsim20$\\% of galaxies across mass bins and potentially contribute up to 60\\% at the very high mass end (log$_{10}$(\\mstar/\\mdot)$>11.5$) of the $z>4$ stellar mass function.",

The advent of extensive survey data calls for more complex physical modelling and more sophisticated statistical analysis, particularly to account for correlated uncertainties. In this paper, we perform a vertical Jeans analysis, including a local approximation of the tilt term, using a sample of $200\\,000$ K-dwarf stars from the Gaia DR3 catalogue. After combination with the Survey-of-Surveys (SoS) catalogue, $160\\,888$ of those have radial velocity measurements. We use Gaussian processes as priors for the covariance matrix of radial and vertical velocities. Joint inference of the posterior distribution of the local dark matter density and the velocity moments is performed using geometric variational inference. We find a local dark matter density of ${\\rho_\\mathrm{dm} = 0.0117 \\pm 0.0035\\, \\mathrm{M}_\\odot\\,\\mathrm{pc}^{-3} = 0.44 \\pm 0.13\\, \\mathrm{GeV}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}$ at the Sun's position, which is in agreement with most other recent analyses. By comparing a ($z$-dependent) Gaussian process prior with a ($z$-independent) scalar prior for the tilt term, we quantify its impact on estimates of the local dark matter density and argue that careful modelling is required to mitigate systematic biases.",

Talbot (2) ((1) Cardiff, (2) MPA, (3) Zurich) 14 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication by MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The presence of magnetic fields in galaxies and their haloes could have important consequences for satellite galaxies moving through the magnetised circumgalactic medium (CGM) of their host. We therefore study the effect of magnetic fields on ram pressure stripping of satellites in the CGM of massive galaxies. We use cosmological `zoom-in' simulations of three massive galaxy haloes ($M_{\\rm{200c}} = 10^{12.5-13}$ M$_\\odot$), each simulated with and without magnetic fields. Across our full sample of satellite galaxies (11 with magnetic fields and 10 without), we find that the fraction of gas retained after infall through the CGM shows no population-wide impact of magnetic fields. However, for the most massive satellites, we find that twice as much gas is stripped without magnetic fields. The evolution of a galaxy's stripped tail is also strongly affected. Magnetic fields reduce turbulent mixing, inhibiting the dispersion of metals into the host CGM. This suppressed mixing greatly reduces condensation from the CGM onto the stripped tail. By studying the magnetic field structure, we find evidence of magnetic draping and attribute differences in the stripping rate to the draping layer. Differences in CGM condensation are attributed to magnetic field lines aligned with the tail suppressing turbulent mixing. We simulate one halo with enhanced resolution in the CGM and show these results are converged with resolution, though the structure of the cool gas in the tail is not. Our results show that magnetic fields can play an important role in ram pressure stripping in galaxy haloes and should be included in simulations of galaxy formation.",

Figures 3 and 4 updated Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate the chemical evolution of N/O using a sample of 45 local star-forming galaxies (SFGs) from the CLASSY survey. This sample spans a wide range of galaxy properties, with robust determinations of nitrogen and oxygen abundances via the direct-$T_{\\rm e}$ method. We explore how N/O relates to density structure, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), stellar age, compactness, and gas kinematics. In addition, we compare our results with those of galaxies at $z =2-10$ where N/O ratios were derived from optical or UV nitrogen lines, aiming to identify chemical enrichment pathways across cosmic time. Our analysis shows that the N/O-O/H relation in CLASSY galaxies aligns with the trends seen in local galaxies and extragalactic HII regions, and that galaxies at $z = 2-6$ exhibit similar N/O values, indicating no significant redshift evolution in N/O for a fixed metallicity. We identify a significant correlation between electron density $n_{\\rm e}$([S II]) and N/O, suggesting that density structure contributes to the scatter in the N/O-O/H relation. The CLASSY galaxies with high SFRs or compact star formation show elevated N/O, though no strong correlation with stellar mass is found. We also find that high-velocity outflows (v$_{out}$ > 350 km/s) and low mass-loading factors are linked to elevated N/O, indicating that feedback plays a significant role. These results highlight the importance of density, star formation, and feedback from young stellar populations in shaping N/O enrichment and provide key insights for interpreting high-$z$ galaxies observed with JWST.",

The quasar JPAS-9600-10844 embedded in the nebula is located at ~ 60.2 kpc (7.3'') from J1620+4334, and shows a compact structure with broad emission lines (> 3000 km/s), typical of active galactic nuclei. At a 2$\\sigma$ surface brightness (SB) contour of $\\sim 1.86 \\times 10^{-16}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$, the nebula extends > 100 kpcs and has a total Ly$\\alpha$ luminosity of $\\sim 5.8 \\pm 0.7 \\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ signify the presence of a giant Enormous Ly$\\alpha$ Nebula (ELAN). The nebula traces an over density of quasars at redshift of 2.2-2.3 consistent with the progenitor of a massive galaxy cluster. The extended CIV emission indicates that the circum-galactic medium (CGM) is metal-enriched and not primordial. The current J-PAS observations suggest photoionization and shocks due to outflows as possible ionization mechanisms. The faint extended FUV and NUV continuum emission likely points to ongoing star formation around the two quasars, suggesting a complex interaction in their environments. These findings provide new insights into the environment of quasars and their role in shaping the dynamics and evolution of the CGM at cosmic noon. Further spectroscopic observations will be required to fully characterize the object's nature and its kinematic properties. This study demonstrates the unique capability of J-PAS to detect massive and rare Ly$\\alpha$ nebulae, providing new insights into their properties, environments, and connections to large-scale structures in the cosmic web such as filaments and overdensities in a large cosmological volume.",

Perets Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Stellar astrophysics relies on diverse observational modalities-primarily photometric light curves and spectroscopic data from which fundamental stellar properties are inferred. While machine learning (ML) has advanced analysis within individual modalities, the complementary information encoded across modalities remains largely underexploited. We present DESA (Dual Embedding model for Stellar Astrophysics), a novel multi-modal foundation model that integrates light curves and spectra to learn a unified, physically meaningful latent space for stars. DESA first trains separate modality-specific encoders using a hybrid supervised/self-supervised scheme, and then aligns them through DualFormer, a Transformer-based cross-modal integration module tailored for astrophysical data. DualFormer combines cross- and self-attention, a novel dual-projection alignment loss, and a projection-space eigendecomposition that yields physically structured embeddings. We demonstrate that DESA significantly outperforms leading unimodal and self-supervised baselines across a range of tasks. In zero- and few-shot settings, DESA's learned representations recover stellar color-magnitude and Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams with high fidelity ($R^2 = 0.92$ for photometric regressions). In full fine-tuning, DESA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for binary star detection (AUC = $0.99$, AP = $1.00$) and stellar age prediction (RMSE = $0.94$ Gyr). As a compelling case, DESA naturally separates synchronized binaries from young stars, two populations with nearly identical light curves, purely from their embedded positions in UMAP space, without requiring external kinematic or luminosity information. DESA thus offers a powerful new framework for multimodal, data-driven stellar population analysis, enabling both accurate prediction and novel discovery.",

PNe exhibit diverse morphologies, the origins of which are not fully understood. PNe with OH (OHPNe) and H$_{2}$O (H$_{2}$OPNe) masers are thought to be nascent PNe. However, the number of known OHPNe and H$_{2}$OPNe remains small, and only in eight cases the position of the maser emission has been found to coincide with the PN, using the high astrometric accuracy of interferometric observations. In order to identify more OHPNe and H$_{2}$OPNe, we used public databases and our own ATCA/VLA observations to match the positions of OH and H$_{2}$O masers with known PNe and radio continuum emitters, considering radio continuum emission as a possible tracer of the photoionized gas that characterizes PNe. Here we report the confirmation of positional coincidence of maser emission with one more PN, and 12 PN candidates. Moreover, we have confirmed three evolved stars as `water fountains' (WFs) hosting H$_2$O masers. These WFs are associated with radio continuum emission, but their possible nature as PNe has not yet been confirmed. Although a final characterization of maser-emitting PNe as a group still requires confirmation of more objects, their distribution in the infrared color-color diagrams suggests that they are a heterogeneous group of PNe. In particular, the new OHPN IRAS 07027$-$7934 has been reported to contain a late [WC]-type central star, while the maser emission implies an O-rich envelope. This property is found in only one other known maser-emitting PN, although we found evidence that other confirmed and candidate OHPNe may also have mixed chemistry, since they show emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The new WF IRAS 18443$-$0231 shows radio continuum that is dominated by strong and variable non-thermal emission, as in magnetized outflows.",

However, due to a lack of interpretability and the associational nature of such models, it is difficult to understand how the information that is included in addition to integrated photometry (e.g., morphology) contributes to the estimation task. Improving our understanding in this field would enable further advances into unraveling the physical connections among galaxy properties and optimizing data exploitation. Therefore, our work is aimed at interpreting the deep learning-based estimation of stellar mass via two interpretability techniques: causal analysis and mutual information decomposition. The former reveals the causal paths between multiple variables beyond nondirectional statistical associations, while the latter quantifies the multicomponent contributions (i.e., redundant, unique, and synergistic) of different input data to the stellar mass estimation. Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we obtained meaningful results that provide physical interpretations for image-based models. Our work demonstrates the gains from combining deep learning with interpretability techniques, and holds promise in promoting more data-driven astrophysical research (e.g., astrophysical parameter estimations and investigations on complex multivariate physical processes).",

Accepted for publication in A&A Letter Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) `Water fountains' (WFs) are optically obscured evolved stars, most of them thought to be in the post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) phase, characterized by H$_{2}$O maser emission tracing molecular jets. Interestingly, four WFs (IRAS 15445$-$5449, IRAS 18019$-$2216, IRAS 18443$-$0231, and IRAS 18464$-$0140) and one WF candidate (IRAS 18480+0008) are potential planetary nebulae (PNe) because they exhibit radio continuum emission, suggesting the presence of a photoionized region characteristic of PNe. To classify these objects, we obtained K-band (2.0-2.3 $\\mu$m) spectra of these WFs, including the only WF PN known (IRAS 15103$-$5754) for comparison. Our spectra reveal two group of sources: (i) `low-velocity' WFs with H$_2$O maser velocity spread of $\\lesssim$50 km s$^{-1}$ (IRAS 18019$-$2216, IRAS 18464$-$0140, and IRAS 18480+0008) showing the CO band at 2.29 $\\mu$m in absorption, typical of cool giant stars, and no emission lines; and (ii) `high-velocity' WFs, velocity spread of $\\gtrsim$50 km s$^{-1}$ (IRAS 15103$-$5754, IRAS 15445$-$5449, and IRAS 18443$-$0231), exhibiting emission lines of Br$\\gamma$, He I, and H$_2$, consistent with hotter central stars and/or shock-excited emission. The emission line ratios of these lines in IRAS 18443$-$0231 indicates that it may be a nascent PN. The spectrum of IRAS 15445$-$5449 also shows a CO band and Na I doublet in emission, suggesting the presence of a compact circumstellar disk and/or active mass loss. These results favor the previously suggested notion that the difference between low- and high-velocity WFs is not simply a projection effect but reflects intrinsically different evolutionary stages. Moreover, the results are also consistent with the idea of an increase in the jet ejection velocity as the post-AGB evolution proceeds.",

Based on the data of 5,859 targets observed in M31 by Gu et al (2024), we selected 30 contact binaries by visual inspection for further study. Using the PHOEBE software and employing Bayesian optimization and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, we determined the physical parameters of these 30 systems. The results show that 10 systems exhibit the O'Connell effect, which is well explained by introducing a dark spot on the primary star. 11 systems have mass ratios below 0.15, classifying them as extremely low mass ratio contact binaries, making them promising candidates for binary mergers. Six systems have primary star temperatures exceeding 10,000 K, classifying them as early-type contact binaries. The absolute physical parameters reveal that two contact binary systems contain massive stellar components, which may eventually evolve into compact binary star systems. To compare the effects of different galactic environments on the evolution of contact binaries, we constructed evolutionary diagrams for these 30 targets and for contact binaries in the Milky Way. The results show that, at the same mass, our targets have larger radii, higher luminosities, and lower orbital angular momenta than contact binaries in the Milky Way, indicating that they are at more advanced evolutionary stages. This may be attributed to the higher metallicity in M31 compared to the Milky Way.",

Sierra-Porta Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Sunspot numbers constitute the longest and most widely used record of solar activity, with direct implications for space weather forecasting and heliophysical research. Traditional sunspot counting relies on visual inspection or algorithmic feature detection, both of which are limited by subjectivity, image quality, and methodological inconsistencies. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enable the direct use of solar imagery for automated prediction tasks, reducing reliance on manual feature engineering. In this work, we present a supervised vision-based regression framework to estimate daily sunspot numbers from full-disk continuum images acquired by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Images from 2011-2024 were paired with daily sunspot numbers from the SILSO Version 2.0 dataset of the Royal Observatory of Belgium. After preprocessing and augmentation, a CNN was trained to predict scalar sunspot counts directly from pixel data. The proposed model achieved strong predictive performance, with R2 = 0.986 and RMSE = 6.25 on the test set, indicating close agreement with SILSO reference values. Comparative evaluation against prior studies shows that our approach performs competitively with, and in several cases outperforms, statistical and hybrid machine learning methods, while offering the novel advantage of bypassing explicit detection and manual feature extraction. Interpretability analyses using Grad-CAM and Integrated Gradients confirmed that the network consistently attends to sunspot regions when forming predictions. These results highlight the potential of deep vision-based approaches for operational solar monitoring, providing a scalable and automated pathway for real-time estimation of classical heliophysical indices",

Pál Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We have identified more than a hundred close triply eclipsing hierarchical triple star systems from data taken with the space telescope TESS. Many of them have outer periods less than or, close to 100 days, hence, we call them `ultracompact hierarchical triples'. These systems are noteworthy in that we can potentially determine their dynamical and astrophysical parameters with a high precision, in many cases even without radial velocity data. In the present paper we report the comprehensive study of ten new ultracompact triply eclipsing triple star systems, located in the northern ecliptic hemisphere, taken from this larger sample: TICs 198581208, 265274458, 283846096, 337993842, 351404069, 378270875, 403792414, 403916758, 405789362, 461500036. Most of the data for this study come from TESS observations, but we obtained supplemental ground-based photometric measurements for two of the systems. The eclipse timing variation curves extracted from the TESS and the ground-based follow up data, the photometric light curves, and the spectral energy distribution are combined in a complex photodynamical analysis to yield the stellar and orbital parameters of all ten systems. The outer periods are in the range of 46.8-101.4 days. We found third-body forced, rapid apsidal motion in four systems. Moreover, TIC 403916758 was found to be a double twin triple (i.e. both the inner and the outer mass ratios are close to unity). All of the systems are substantially flat, with mutual inclination angles of $<5^o$. Finally, we have taken the results for the ten systems in the present paper, and combined them with the system parameters for more than 30 other compact triples that we have reported on in previous work, in order to examine some of the global properties of these systems on a statistical basis.",

      "abstract": "A type II solar radio burst without a coronal mass ejection association Anshu Kumari, Nat Gopalswamy 8 pages, 4 figues, 2 tables, accepted for publication in Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Type II solar radio bursts are commonly associated with shocks generated by coronal mass ejections (CMEs), where plasma waves are excited by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes and converted into radio waves at the local plasma frequency or its harmonics. However, there are instances where type II bursts occur in the absence of whitelight CMEs. We analysed one such metric type II radio burst observed on November 2, 2023, characterized by split band features and fundamental-harmonic lanes. Notably, no CME was detected with space-based coronagraphs during this event. However, an intense M1.6 class flare was observed just before the type II burst and an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) disturbance was observed expanding into surrounding regions. The absence of any whitelight CME seen in any coronagraph field of view even though the EUV shock had a moderate speed of $\\approx500~km/s$, which was close to the shock speed derived from radio observations, %indicates that the shock in the inner corona was most-likely produced by the very intense solar flare and the type II was associated with the EUV disturbance seen in the lower corona. These observations indicate that the shock in the inner corona was most-likely driven by the EUV ejecta seen in the lower corona, but the ejecta did not survive as a CME in the coronagraph field of view.",

Browning, Mykola Gordovskyy 22 pages, 15 figures, to be published in MNRAS (accepted) Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Twisted coronal loops in the solar atmosphere may become kink-unstable when their magnetic field lines are sufficiently twisted. This instability can trigger magnetic reconnection, leading to the emission of electromagnetic radiation, which manifests as a solar flare. Previous research has demonstrated that oscillations in microwave emissions, resembling observed quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs), can be generated by the reconnecting loop. Our aim is to investigate the relationship between the oscillations of the loop and these microwave pulsations. Using 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations, we examine two models: a straight loop in a uniform-density atmosphere and a curved loop in a gravitationally stratified atmosphere. Using new methodology, we extract the reconnecting loop-top from both models and identify structural oscillations. We then compare these oscillations with the gyrosynchrotron (GS) radiation emitted from the simulations, which is forward-modelled using a radiative transfer code. We find that oscillations in the GS emissions are driven by sausage and kink-mode oscillations. However, the relationship between the oscillation frequencies of the GS emission and the identified loop oscillation modes is complex. The dominant mode in the former may result from interference between sausage-mode and kink-mode oscillations or entirely different mechanisms. Results such as these increase our understanding of the time-dependent behaviour of solar flares and lay the groundwork for potential diagnostic tools that could be used to determine physical parameters within a flaring loop",

This discrepancy is believed to be caused by the underestimation of the convective core masses. The efficiency of such measurement is usually impaired by a lot of processes at work in the interior of the stars such as convective core overshooting and interior rotation. By integrating the precision of asteroseismology which provides insights into the internal structure and dynamics of stars, with the detailed observational constraints offered by eclipsing binary systems, this study aims to precisely characterize a sample of massive stars in eclipsing binaries to infer their properties and evolutionary state. In this paper, the sample, observed photometrically with TESS and spectroscopically with SALT HRS, CHIRON, HERMES and a spectrograph at Skalnate Pleso Observatory between 2021 and 2024, are analyzed. The orbital elements as well as the basic stellar parameters of the targets in the sample are fitted to derive the geometry of their orbits as well as their absolute parameters. The asteroseismic properties of the targets are also obtained, which unravel their core dynamics and profiles. This is a precursor work that provides detailed characterization of the targets in the sample for future theoretical modeling.",

We aim to investigate differences between H-shell (Red-Giant Branch; RGB) and He-burning (red clump and Asymptotic-Giant Branch; AGB) stars in the He-II ionisation zone and the sensitivity of seismic parameters to input physics in stellar models.

P-mode frequencies were inferred by suppressing g-modes in the core. The main factors affecting seismic observables are stellar mass and metallicity. The He-II glitch amplitude in the local large frequency separation $\\Delta\\nu$ correlates with the He-II ionisation zone density, explaining observed differences between RGB and clump/AGB stars.

Bódi Accepted for publication in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Classical Cepheid stars that pulsate in the first overtone radial mode often exhibit additional periodicities at the millimagnitude level. Extensive studies of the OGLE data of the Magellanic Clouds have revealed distinct groups based on their period ratio with the first overtone mode. These groups are similar to those found in overtone RR Lyrae stars. Theoretical calculations suggest that some of the observed periodicities may be consistent with non-radial modes, while others remain unexplained. Currently, we only know of a handful of examples from the Galactic Cepheid sample that exhibit low-amplitude periodicities. The purpose of this study is to undertake a systematic search for low-amplitude variability in overtone Cepheids of the Milky Way in the photometric data of the full-frame images of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, which were produced with the MIT Quick Look Pipeline. We applied standard Fourier analysis and classified the additional signals according to their period ratio to the overtone pulsation period. We found 127 stars in total to exhibit additional periodicities. In 17 stars, these can be identified as a second radial overtone. A further 83 stars were observed to display periodic signals with a ratio of $P_{\\mathrm{x}}/P_{1\\mathrm{O}}$ in the range 0.60$-$0.65. In 15 stars, the $P_{1\\mathrm{O}}/P_{\\mathrm{x}}$ is found to be near $\\sim$0.68, of which six are also found to be in the previous group. Furthermore, we observed the presence of low-amplitude signals in 22 stars outside the aforementioned period ratios. It is possible that some of these may be direct detections of non-radial modes, with no harmonic frequency peak in the 0.60$-$0.65 period range. The TESS measurements revealed that the amplitudes and frequencies of these signals often vary within a TESS sector, a phenomenon that challenges theoretical models.",

The Chroma+ suite now computes the emergent surface intensity and flux distributions and the hydrostatic pressure structure assuming a spherical atmosphere rather than local flatness by implementing the analytic formal solution of the 1D spherical radiative transfer equation of Chapman (1966} based on an integration factor.

      "abstract": "The impact of internal versus external perturbations on close-in exoplanet architectures Christina Schoettler, James E Owen 13 pages, 15 figures, submitted to Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, comments welcome Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Young planetary systems are subjected to different dynamical effects that can influence their orbital structure over time. In systems with more than one planet, other planets can internally influence each other, e.g. via planet-planet scattering. External perturbing effects also need to be taken into account, as stars do not form by themselves but together with other stars in young star-forming regions. This birth environment can externally affect young multi-planet systems, e.g. via fly-bys. Previous work has shown that the absence/presence and location of an outer giant planet around a close-in planet system do not change how these inner planets react to a single fly-by with another star. We further explore this by comparing the effects of these external perturbations on four close-in sub-Neptune planets to those caused by a situation where only the distant giant is perturbed by the same kind of encounter. Our results indicate that the close-in planet systems have a \"preferred\" end state after 500 Myr, which is reached regardless of how it was perturbed. In addition, the mass of the giant appears not to impact the reaction of the inner planet system in the scenario of an external perturbation in our tested set-ups, i.e. either a single 1 or 5 M_Jup giant placed at 2.5, 5, 10 or 20 au. However, the mass affects the subsequent evolution of the inner planets if only internal perturbations by the giant are considered. The reduction in mass leads to an absence of collisions during the 500 Myr.",

Rubenzahl, Megan Bedell 17 pages, 6 figures, accepted to AJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Planets and their host stars form from the same cloud of gas and dust, so we assume that their chemical compositions are linked. However, a clear correlation between rocky planet interior properties and host star chemistry remains elusive for planets around FGK dwarfs, and non-existent for planets around M dwarfs because cool stars frequently lack detailed chemical information. Here, we investigate the relationship between small (R$_{P}$ $\\leq$ 1.8 R$_{\\oplus}$) planet densities and host star elemental abundances. We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V/Milky Way Mapper and an accompanying data-driven framework to obtain abundances for FGK and M dwarf hosts of 22 rocky planets. We find that planet densities exhibit a strong, inverse relationship to [Mg/Fe] abundances of FGK hosts (p = 0.001). This correlation becomes more significant with the addition of M dwarf hosts (p = 0.0005). If we assume that rocky planets have terrestrial-like compositions, this suggests that low [Mg/Fe] environments form planets with larger Fe-rich cores and thus higher densities. The thick disk planets in our sample help anchor this trend, illustrating the importance of sampling exoplanet properties across a range of host star populations. This finding highlights the connection between Galactic chemical evolution and rocky planet formation, and indicates that Earth-like planet compositions may vary significantly across different regions of the Galaxy.",

They were designed, built, and tested by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). The CCORs will be used by NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center to detect and track Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and predict the Space Weather. CCOR-1 is on board the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite -U (GOES-U, now GOES-19/GOES-East). GOES-U was launched from Kennedy Space Flight Center, Florida, on 25 June 2024. CCOR-2 is on board the Space Weather Follow On at Lagrange point 1 (SWFO-L1). SWFO-L1 is scheduled to launch in the fall of 2025. SWFO will be renamed SOLAR-1 once it reaches L1. The CCORs are white-light coronagraphs that have a field of view and performance similar to the SOHO LASCO C3 coronagraph. CCOR-1 FOV spans from 4 to 22 Rsun, while CCOR-2 spans from 3.5 to 26 Rsun. The spatial resolution is 39 arcsec for CCOR-1 and 65 arcsec for CCOR-2. They both operate in a band-pass of 470 - 740 nm. The synoptic cadence is 15 min and the latency from image capture to the forecaster on the ground is less than 30 min. Compared to past generation coronagraphs such as the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO), CCOR uses a compact design; all the solar occultation is done with a single multi-disk external occulter. No internal occulter is used. This allowed a substantial reduction in size and mass compared to SECCHI COR-2, for example, but with slightly lower signal-to-noise ratio. In this article, we review the science that the CCORs will capitalize on for the purpose of operational space weather prediction. We give a description of the driving requirements and accommodations, and provide details on the instrument design. In the end, information on ground processing and data levels is provided.",

CCAT features the 6-meter Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST), which will cover frequency bands from 210 GHz to 850 GHz using its first-generation science instrument, Prime-Cam. The detectors used in Prime-Cam are feedhorn-coupled, lumped-element superconducting microwave kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). The telescope will perform wide-area surveys at speeds on the order of degrees per second. During telescope operation, the KIDs are exposed to changes in the magnetic field caused by the telescope's movement through Earth's magnetic field and internal sources within the telescope. We present and compare measurements of the magnetic sensitivity of three different CCAT KID designs at 100 mK. The measurements are conducted in a dilution refrigerator (DR) with a set of room temperature Helmholtz coils positioned around the DR. We discuss the implications of these results for CCAT field operations.",

Spiga Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) When performing X-ray observations with a Wolter-I telescope, the presence of bright off-axis sources can introduce unfocused rays, known as straylight, which contaminate the detector and compromise the scientific analysis. Among the different components of straylight, single reflections off the hyperboloid section of the mirror shells often produce arc-like patterns on the detector. These arcs depend not only on the off-axis angle of the source but also on the geometrical alignment of the individual shells. In this paper, we introduce the SHell misAlignment Detection for straylight Estimation (SHADE) algorithm, a novel and flexible tool designed to infer the misalignment parameters of individual shells, reproduce the geometry of straylight arcs and predict its pattern on the detector. SHADE allows us to model each shell displacement with two parameters: $(\\gamma,\\xi)$ that represents the tilt amplitude and direction. While the algorithm is general and applicable to any Wolter-like telescope, we demonstrate its effectiveness using a set of XMM-Newton observations of the low-mass X-ray binary GX5-1. As a proof of concept, we recover the best-fit misalignment parameters for a selected shell, obtaining $\\gamma = 21.9''^{+10.3}_{-9.02}$ and $\\xi = 5.88^{+1.02}_{-0.97}$ rad. SHADE represents a new approach to diagnosing mirror misalignments from straylight patterns and can support both pre and post-launch calibration efforts and future telescope designs.",

Levan Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Context: Astronomical imaging aims to maximize signal capture while minimizing noise. Enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio directly on detectors is difficult and expensive, leading to extensive research in advanced post-processing techniques. Aims: Removing background noise from images is a valuable pre-processing step catalog-building tasks. We introduce BGRem, a machine learning (ML) based tool to remove background noise from astronomical images. Methods: BGRem uses a diffusion-based model with an attention U-Net as backbone, trained on simulated images for optical and gamma ({\\gamma})-ray data from the MeerLICHT and Fermi-LAT telescopes. In a supervised manner, BGRem learns to denoise astronomical images over several diffusion steps. Results: BGRem performance was compared with a widely used tool for cataloging astronomical sources, SourceExtractor (SExtractor). It was shown that the amount of true positive sources using SExtractor increased by about 7% for MeerLICHT data when BGRem was used as a pre-processing step. We also show the generalizability of BGRem by testing it with optical images from different telescopes and also on simulated {\\gamma}-ray data representative of the Fermi-LAT telescope. We show that in both cases, BGRem improves the source detection efficiency. Conclusions: BGRem can improve the accuracy in source detection of traditional pixel-based methods by removing complex background noise. Using zero-shot approach, BGRem can generalize well to a wide range of optical images. The successful application of BGRem to simulated {\\gamma}-ray images, alongside optical data, demonstrates its adaptability to distinct noise characteristics and observational domains. This cross-wavelength performance highlights its potential as a general-purpose background removal framework for multi-wavelength astronomical surveys.",

SPIE 13626, Optics for EUV, X-Ray, and Gamma-Ray Astronomy XII, 1362611, 2025 Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The localization of X-ray counterparts to gravitational wave events requires a telescope with accurate localization capability in a field of view comparable to the region constrained by the gravitational wave detectors. In the context of a small, dedicated, mission, we investigate which optical design could satisfy this capability. We compare the possible optical designs that have been proposed for X-rays: the Lobster Eye design (both in the Angel and Schmidt variant) - inspired by the eyes of crustaceans - consisting of many small capillaries where grazing incidence reflection occurs, the Kirkpatrick-Baez design, where double reflection occurs on two orthogonal parabolic mirrors, and the standard Wolter-I design. We find that the first two designs, compared to the latter, can achieve a significantly larger field of view, and have a good localization capability if the focal length is longer than existing Lobster Eye designs. The Kirkpatrick-Baez design presents the best angular resolution, but the best overall field of view is obtained with a Lobster system: we present a small optical module able to achieve an effective area $>$100 cm$^2$ at 1 keV in a field of view of 10 deg$^2$.",

So far, existing benchmarks and evaluations focus on simple question-answering that primarily tests astronomical knowledge and fails to evaluate the complex reasoning required for real-world research in the discipline. Here, we address this gap by systematically benchmarking five state-of-the-art LLMs on the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics (IOAA) exams, which are designed to examine deep conceptual understanding, multi-step derivations, and multimodal analysis. With average scores of 85.6% and 84.2%, Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 (the two top-performing models) not only achieve gold medal level performance but also rank in the top two among ~200-300 participants in all four IOAA theory exams evaluated (2022-2025). In comparison, results on the data analysis exams show more divergence. GPT-5 still excels in the exams with an 88.5% average score, ranking top 10 among the participants in the four most recent IOAAs, while other models' performances drop to 48-76%. Furthermore, our in-depth error analysis underscores conceptual reasoning, geometric reasoning, and spatial visualization (52-79% accuracy) as consistent weaknesses among all LLMs. Hence, although LLMs approach peak human performance in theory exams, critical gaps must be addressed before they can serve as autonomous research agents in astronomy.",

Emran 19 pages, 4 figures, Accepted in Icarus Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Europa's surface composition and physical characteristics are commonly constrained using spectral deconvolution through linear mixture (LM) modeling and radiative transfer-based (RT) intimate mixture modeling. Here, I compared the results of these two spectral modeling- LM versus RT- against laboratory spectra of water (H$_{2}$O) ice and sulfuric acid octahydrate (SAO; H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\\cdot$8H$_{2}$O) mixtures measured at near-infrared wavelengths ($\\sim$1.2-2.5 $\\mu$m) with grain sizes of 90-106 $\\mu$m (Hayes and Li, 2025). The modeled abundances indicate that the RT more closely reproduces the laboratory abundances, with deviations within $\\pm$5% for both H$_{2}$O ice and H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\\cdot$8H$_{2}$O with $\\sim$100 $\\mu$m grains. In contrast, the LM shows slightly larger discrepancies, typically ranging from $\\pm$5-15% from the true abundances. Interestingly, both LM and RT tend to consistently overestimate the abundance of H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\\cdot$8H$_{2}$O and underestimate H$_{2}$O ice across all mixtures. Nonetheless, when H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\\cdot$8H$_{2}$O either dominates (>80% as observed on Europa's trailing hemisphere; Carlson et al. 2005) or is present only in trace amounts ($\\sim$10% on areas in Europa's leading hemisphere; Dalton III et al. 2013; Ligier et al. 2016), both the LM and RT render acceptable results within $\\pm$10% uncertainty. Thus, spectral modeling using the RT is preferred for constraining the surface composition across Europa, although the LM remains viable in specific compositional regimes.",

Lewis Accepted to Physical Review PER Physics Education (physics.ed-ph); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Writing is a critical skill for modern science, enabling collaboration, scientific discourse, public outreach, and more. Accordingly, it is important to consider how physicists and astronomers are trained to write. This study aims to understand the landscape of science writing education, specifically in physics and astronomy, in higher education in the United States. An online survey probing various aspects of their writing training in both undergraduate and graduate school was administered to 515 participants who have obtained training in physics and/or astronomy, or related fields, at the level equal to or beyond upper-division undergraduate study. Humanities and writing requirement courses appear to have a key role in general writing education, while laboratory courses and feedback from mentors are the dominant modes of science writing education in undergraduate and graduate school respectively. There is substantial variation in the quality of writing education in physics and astronomy, often dependent on the student's institution and/or mentor. Some participants also report that their success in disciplinary writing was a result of a solid foundation from K-12 education and/or self-direction towards resources; such reliance on past experiences and student background may contribute to inequality in the field. Many participants also stated a clear desire for more structured writing training to be available in the field. We provide suggestions for how to implement such training to meet the needs of the community identified in the survey.",

Gagunashvili Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex); Applications (stat.AP) Two maximum likelihood-based algorithms for unfolding or deconvolution are considered: the Richardson-Lucy method and the Data Unfolding method with Mean Integrated Square Error (MISE) optimization [10]. Unfolding is viewed as a procedure for estimating an unknown probability density function. Both external and internal quality assessment methods can be applied for this purpose. In some cases, external criteria exist to evaluate deconvolution quality. A typical example is the deconvolution of a blurred image, where the sharpness of the restored image serves as an indicator of quality. However, defining such external criteria can be challenging, particularly when a measurement has not been performed previously. In such instances, internal criteria are necessary to assess the quality of the result independently of external information. The article discusses two internal criteria: MISE for the unfolded distribution and the condition number of the correlation matrix of the unfolded distribution. These internal quality criteria are applied to a comparative analysis of the two methods using identical numerical data. The results of the analysis demonstrate the superiority of the Data Unfolding method with MISE optimization over the Richardson-Lucy method.",

Operating from the Earth-Sun L2 point and observing in the near-infrared, Roman has the high sensitivity and high spatial resolution needed to measure the physical properties, compositions, and orbital trajectories of NEOs in order to understand their physical nature and potential hazards to Earth. Roman's planetary defense capabilities complement those of two wide-field survey missions: the now operational ground-based Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the upcoming space-based NEO Surveyor. Rubin, observing in visible light, will discover over 100,000 NEOs. NEO Surveyor, observing in the mid-infrared where NEO thermal emission peaks, will detect 200,000-300,000 NEOs, some as small as ~20 meters in diameter. With investment in developing the pipeline infrastructure required to extract information from moving target streaks, Roman will be able to observe NEOs down to the smallest sizes in order to improve our measurements of NEO orbits by 2-3 orders of magnitude, enable accurate diameter and albedo estimates in conjunction with NEO Surveyor, and reveal the spectral types and bulk compositions of the smallest NEOs. Together, these three US-led facilities will operate across the electromagnetic spectrum to form a comprehensive planetary defense network.",

Here, we tried to estimate the corresponding quantity by the analysis of surface temperatures on the Earth and Mars, which are formed by a competition between a variable luminosity of the Sun and increasing radii of the planetary orbits. Our work employs paleochemical and paleobiological data on the temperature of the ancient Earth, on the one hand, and geological data on the existence of an ocean of liquid water on the ancient Mars, on the other hand. As follows from our analysis, the martian data impose only a weak constraint on the admissible values of the Hubble parameter because of the unknown salinity - and, therefore, the freezing point - of the martian water. On the other hand, the terrestrial data turn out to be much more valuable, especially, for the Precambrian period, when temperature variation was sufficiently smooth and monotonic. For example, in the framework of standard LambdaCDM model with 70% of dark energy, contemporary value of the local Hubble parameter was found to be 70-90 km/s/Mpc under assumption that the Earth's surface temperature in the end of Precambrian equaled 45 C. This is in reasonable agreement both with the intergalactic data and with an independent estimate of the local Hubble parameter from tidal evolution of the Earth-Moon system.",

Kulichkov 31 pages, 13 figures. Pure Appl. Geophys. (2025) Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph) We investigate the influence of a fine-scale (FS) layered structure in the atmosphere on the propagation of infrasound signals generated by fragmenting meteoroids. Using a pseudo-differential parabolic equation (PPE) approach, we model broadband acoustic signals from point sources at altitudes of 35-100 km. The presence of FS fluctuations in the stratosphere (37-45 km) and the lower thermosphere (100-120 km) modifies ray trajectories, causing multiple arrivals and prolonged signal durations at ground stations. In particular, meteoroids fragmenting at 80-100 km can produce two distinct thermospheric arrivals beyond 150km range, while meteoroids descending to 50 km or below yield weak, long-lived arrivals within the acoustic shadow zone via antiguiding propagation and diffraction. Comparison with observed infrasound data confirms that FS-layered inhomogeneities can account for multi-arrival \"N-waves,\" broadening potential interpretations of meteoroid signals. The results also apply to other atmospheric-entry objects, such as sample return capsules, emphasizing how FS structure impacts shock wave propagation. Our findings advance understanding of wavefield evolution in a layered atmosphere and have broad relevance for global infrasound monitoring of diverse phenomena (e.g., re-entry capsules, rocket launches, and large-scale explosions).",

We present new JWST NIRSpec G395H phase-curve observations that probe its atmospheric composition in unprecedented detail. At near-infrared wavelengths, which penetrate the high-altitude clouds inferred from previous NIRISS/SOSS spectra, thermal emission reveals a carbon-rich atmosphere with opacity dominated by carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Both species are detected at all orbital phases, with retrieved mixing ratios of 10^-1 for CO and 10^-4 for CO2, indicating a globally well-mixed reservoir of carbon-bearing gases. We also moderately detect water vapor (H2O) and tentatively detect sulfur dioxide (SO2), providing insight into its chemistry and possible photochemical production under intense stellar irradiation. From these detections we infer a carbon-to-oxygen ratio near unity (C/O ~ 1) and a metallicity exceeding 500X Solar, consistent with equilibrium chemistry predictions for high-temperature atmospheres. This enrichment raises the mean molecular weight, reducing atmospheric escape, and likely helps LTT-9779 b retain a substantial atmosphere despite extreme irradiation. Our findings show that LTT-9779 b survives where few planets can, maintaining a carbon-rich atmosphere in a region where hot Neptune-class worlds are expected to evaporate. This makes LTT-9779 b a valuable laboratory for studying atmospheric escape and chemical processes under extreme conditions, offering new insight into the survival of planets in the hot Neptune desert.",

The faulted structure of Kiladze, including shaping by numerous collapse pits and the distortion of the shape of the depression, are compatible with the surroundings in Hayabusa Terra, east of Sputnik Planitia. They are further compatible with an interpretation as a caldera formed during an era of an active cryovolcanic period that appears to be significantly more recent than the overall age of the planet's surface, possibly in the last several million years. In view of the size of the caldera and the large scale of the surrounding distribution of water ice, we suggest that Kiladze may have been a cryovolcano, in which one or more explosive events may have erupted $\\sim$1000 km$_{3}$ of icy cryomagma onto the surface.",

Here, we reanalyze the published data and reproduce previously retrieved molecular abundances based on an independent data reduction and a different retrieval framework. The aim of this study is to refine the understanding of TOI-270 d and highlight considerations for JWST data analysis. Additionally, we test the impact of data resolution on atmospheric retrieval calculations. We reduce one JWST NIRSpec G395H and one NIRISS SOSS GR700XD transit dataset using the Eureka! pipeline and a custom MCMC-based light curve fitting algorithm at the instruments' native resolutions. The atmospheric composition is estimated with the updated BeAR retrieval code across a grid of retrieval setups and spectral resolutions. Our transit spectrum is consistent with previous studies, except at the red end of the NIRISS data. Our retrievals support a higher mean molecular weight atmosphere for TOI-270 d. We provide refined abundance constraints and find statistically favored model extensions indicating either sulfur-rich chemistry with species such as CS2, CS, and H2CS, or the possible presence of CH3Cl or CH3F. However, Bayesian inference cannot distinguish between these scenarios due to similar opacities below 4 microns. Our analysis reinforces TOI-270 d as a highly interesting warm sub-Neptune for atmospheric studies, with a complex chemistry in a cloud-free upper atmosphere. However, its exact nature remains uncertain and warrants further detailed photochemical modeling and observations.",

Park, Alexander Berne, Douglas Hemingway, Mohit Melwani Daswani, Steven D Vance Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Enceladus is among the most intriguing bodies in the solar system due to its astrobiological potential. Determining the extent and duration of habitability (i.e., sustained habitability) requires characterizing the interior properties and the level and distribution of tidal heating in Enceladus. Inferring the intensity of geophysical activity in the core has direct implications for the potential hydrothermal activity and supply of chemical species important for habitability to the ocean. We build a statistical framework to constrain the interior using estimates of libration, shape, heat flux, gravity, and total mass. We use this framework to examine the extent that geodetic measurements can improve our understanding of the interior structure, with an emphasis on partitioning of dissipation between the shell and the core. We quantify plausible ranges of gravitational (k2) and displacement (h2, l2) tidal Love numbers consistent with existing observations. We demonstrate that measuring k2 alone can only constrain the total tidally dissipated energy, but not its radial distribution. However, measuring the amplitude and phase of h2 or l2 facilitates determining the extent of tidal dissipation in the shell and the core. We provide the precisions required for measuring k2, h2, and l2 that enable distinguishing between the main tidal heating scenarios, i.e., in the shell versus the core. We also explore the effect of the structural heterogeneities of the shell on the tidal response. Lastly, we evaluate the efficacy of future geodetic measurements to constrain key interior properties essential to understand the present-day (instantaneous) and long-term (sustained) habitability at Enceladus.",

      "abstract": "Differentiation, the exception not the rule -- Evidence for full miscibility in sub-Neptune interiors Edward D. Young, Aaron Werlen, Sarah P. Marcum, Lars Stixrude, Cornelis P. Dullemond Paper now in Press in PSJ, updated description of the density effects of Fe Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We investigate the consequences of non-ideal mixing between silicate, iron metal, and hydrogen for the structures of the cores of sub-Neptunes with implications for super-Earths, warm Neptunes, and ice giants. A method of extrapolating what we know about the miscibility in the three bounding binary systems MgSiO$_3$-H$_2$, MgSiO$_3$-Fe, and Fe-H$_2$ to the ternary composition space is used to deduce the phase equilibria of this system at relevant temperature and pressure conditions. We find that while separate silicate and metal phases can exist at shallow depths, the phases become entirely miscible deeper in the cores, thus altering the density structure of the cores. The assumption that the interiors of large rocky planets, either with extant magma oceans beneath H$_2$-rich envelopes, or evolved from such bodies, are composed of a differentiated metal core overlain by a silicate mantle is inconsistent with our understanding of the phase equilibria of these bodies.",
