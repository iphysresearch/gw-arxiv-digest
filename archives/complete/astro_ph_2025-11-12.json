Intriguingly, the data favor a transition of the dark energy equation of state across $w=-1$, a hallmark of the Quintom scenario. In this paper, we consider a different approach to the dynamical nature of dark energy by investigating its interaction with ordinary matters, specifically the Chern-Simons (CS) interaction with photons. In cosmology, this interaction rotates the polarized plane of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons, which induces non-zero polarized TB and EB power spectra. We forecast this measurement with the Ali CMB Polarization Telescope (AliCPT) experiment. We take the best-fit value of the isotropic rotation angle from Planck data as our fiducial input. We project that 11 module-year (modyr) of observations will yield an improved detection sensitivity with a significance $\\sim 5\\sigma$, given a calibration precision of $0.1^\\circ$ in the polarization angle. We also forecast AliCPT's sensitivity to the amplitude of a scale invariant spectrum of the anisotropic polarization rotation field. With $50$~modyr of observations, the large-aperture configuration is expected to reach $\\sigma_{A_{\\mathrm{CB}}}\\sim10^{-2}$, offering a sixfold improvement over the small-aperture design and enabling competitive tests of spatial fluctuations in the dark energy field.",

In this model, a GUT Higgs field both drives inflation and induces intermediate-scale symmetry breaking, thereby linking primordial cosmology, gauge unification, and topological defect formation. A partial inflationary phase of $N_I \\sim 10$--$17$ $e$-folds following monopole formation can dilute magnetic monopoles to abundances $Y_M \\sim 10^{-35}$--$10^{-27}$. The model yields Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) predictions of $0.955 \\lesssim n_s \\lesssim 0.974$, accommodating the tensions between Planck-BICEP ($n_s \\approx 0.965$) and Planck+ACT ($n_s \\approx 0.971$) via $\\phi < M$ and $\\phi > M$ branches repectively. The predicted tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \\lesssim 8\\times10^{-4}$ lies within current observational constraints and is accessible to forthcoming experiments, including the Simons Observatory and LiteBIRD. The resulting correlations between the unification scale $M_U$, the inflationary observables $(n_s, r)$, and proton-decay lifetimes highlight a complementarity between CMB measurements and proton-decay searches, with regions of parameter space testable in forthcoming experiments such as Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE.",

GR was created by A. Einstein in 1915. In 1917 Einstein proposed the first (static) cosmological model. Soon after the A. Eddington proved that the model is unstable therefore it can not be realizable in nature. In 1922 and 1924 A. A. Friedmann found non-stationary solutions for cosmological equations written in the framework of GR. In 1927 G. Lemaitre obtained very similar results and, in addition, he derived the Hubble law (E. Hubble obtained this law from observations). Unfortunately, G. Lemaitre published his paper in not very popular Belgium journal. In 1931 Lemaitre proposed the first version of hot Universe model (he called it hypothesis of the primeval atom). In his book Lemaitre predicted even a background radiation as a signature of his model. One of the important property of the Lemaitre -- Gamow model was a prediction of CMB radiation with a temperature around a few K. It was recalled that the discovery of CMB radiation was done by T. Shmaonov in 1956 and his paper was published in 1957 (several years before Penzias and Wilson). In 1965, 1970 E. B. Gliner proposed vacuum like equation of matter which could correspond to exponential explosion of the Universe which was later called inflation. For decades in USSR, Friedmann's cosmological non-stationary models were treated as purely mathematical results without cosmologocal applications. On September 16, 1925 passed away untimely and it would be reasonable to remind today his great contribution in physical cosmology since the authors of book on Friedmann wrote that \"similarly to Copernicus who forced the Earth to move Friedmann forced the Universe to expand\".",

Simulations are continued until about $30$ milliseconds after merger. However, due to significant baryonic pollution, the binary fails to produce a magnetically-dominated outflow.

While theoretical models of shadows in vacuum are mature, real astrophysical black holes like M87* and Sgr A* are enveloped in plasma, which can alter photon trajectories through dispersion. Current understanding, based on foundational work, indicates that only specific plasma distributions allow for an analytical treatment via the separation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we build upon this framework to systematically investigate the propagation of light rays in Kerr spacetime surrounded by a pressureless, non-magnetized cold plasma. We explicitly derive the separability condition, identifying the exact class of plasma densities that permit a generalized Carter constant. For these models, we compute the photon regions and shadow boundaries, characterizing how the shadow's size and shape deviate from the vacuum case in a frequency-dependent manner. Our results provide analytical benchmarks for the distortion of shadows in dispersive media and determine the critical plasma frequency beyond which the shadow is erased, offering a direct link between observable shadow features and the properties of the ambient plasma environment and providing a foundation for studying more dynamic, non-separable plasma distributions.",

Medeiros Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We analyze the Starobinsky inflation model and the impact of curvature corrections, particularly a cubic $R^3$ term, to assess their behavior in light of the latest observational results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). With the recent sixth data release (DR6), the scalar spectral index was measured to be $n_s=0.9743 \\pm 0.0034$, which appears to exclude the pure Starobinsky model at approximately the $2\\sigma$ level. In this paper, we implement the Starobinsky inflationary potential directly into the CLASS code, without relying on the slow-roll approximation, and we constrain the number of e-folds of inflation $N_k$ using a theoretically motivated range derived from reheating considerations and standard couplings between matter fields and gravity. We show that it is still possible to identify a significant region of parameter space where the Starobinsky model remains highly consistent with the latest observational data. While the pure Starobinsky model remains a compelling candidate for cosmic inflation, we explore how including a cubic $R^3$ term can shift its predictions to better align with the Planck and ACT measurements.",

Dinda, Sheean Jolicoeur, Roy Maartens Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The turnover at the peak of the Fourier matter power spectrum encodes a fundamental signature of matter-radiation equality in the early Universe. This delivers a potential standard ruler, independent of baryon acoustic oscillations and therefore able to break parameter degeneracies and improve precision. Furthermore, the turnover scale is independent of redshift and clustering bias, allowing for stacking of the signals from redshift bins. In practice, the very large scale of the turnover means that sample variance and systematics are serious impediments to its detection. Detections of the turnover and measurements of its scale have been made in the WiggleZ, eBOSS, Quaia, and DESI surveys. Upcoming surveys should improve the detection significance and reduce errors on the turnover scale. We use MCMC forecasts for turnover detection in a spectroscopic Euclid-like survey and a futuristic MegaMapper-like survey. In addition to the power spectrum, we include the signal from the bispectrum in equilateral configurations. These surveys are forecast to detect the turnover at $\\sim\\! 6\\sigma$ (Euclid-like) and $\\sim\\! 15\\sigma$ (MegaMapper-like), with precision on the turnover scale of $\\sim\\! 4\\%$ and $\\sim\\! 2\\%$.

The induced GWs can be significantly enhanced when the Universe undergoes a sudden transition from an eMD era to an era with pressure, such as a radiation or kination era. This enhancement arises from the growth of density perturbations during the eMD era and their rapid oscillations during the era with pressure. This phenomenon is called the poltergeist mechanism. In this review, we explain the essence of the poltergeist mechanism and explore concrete scenarios in which such an enhancement can occur.",

However, extracting this information and conducting parameter estimation remains a computationally challenging and expensive task. Wong et al. introduced Jim arXiv:2302.05333, a parameter estimation pipeline that combines relative binning and jax features such as hardware acceleration and automatic differentiation into a normalizing flow-enhanced sampler for gravitational waves from binary black hole (BBH) mergers. In this work, we extend the Jim framework to analyze gravitational wave signals from binary neutron stars (BNS) mergers with tidal effects included. We demonstrate that Jim can be used for full Bayesian parameter estimation of gravitational waves from BNS mergers within a few tens of minutes, which includes the training of the normalizing flow and computing the reference parameters for relative binning. For instance, Jim can analyze GW170817 in 26 minutes (33 minutes) of total wall time using the TaylorF2 (IMRPhenomD_NRTidalv2) waveform, and GW190425 in around 21 minutes for both waveforms. We highlight the importance of such an efficient parameter estimation pipeline for several science cases as well as its ecologically friendly implementation of gravitational wave parameter estimation.",

D 111, 123030 (2025) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Black holes (BHs) with masses between $\\sim 3-5M_{\\odot}$, produced by a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, can further pair up with a neutron star or BH and merge again within a Hubble time. However, the astrophysical environments in which this can happen and the rate of such mergers are open questions in astrophysics. Gravitational waves may play an important role in answering these questions. In this context, we discuss the possibility that the primary of the recent LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA binary GW230529_181500 (GW230529, in short) is the product of a previous BNS merger. Invoking numerical relativity (NR)-based fitting formulas that map the binary constituents' masses and tidal deformabilities to the mass, spin, and kick velocity of the remnant BH, we investigate the potential parents of GW230529's primary. Our calculations using NR fits based on BNS simulations reveal that the remnant of a high-mass BNS merger similar to GW190425 is consistent with the primary of GW230529. This argument is further strengthened by the gravitational wave-based merger rate estimation of GW190425-like and GW230529-like populations. We show that around 18% (median) of the GW190425-like remnants could become the primary component in GW230529-like mergers. The dimensionless tidal deformability parameter of the heavier neutron star in the parent binary is constrained to $67^{+163}_{-61}$ at 90% credibility. Using estimates of the gravitational-wave kick imparted to the remnant, we also discuss the astrophysical environments in which these types of mergers can take place and the implications for their future observations.",

First, we enable full Bayesian inference in under one hour of wall time on a GPU by using gradient-based samplers, without requiring pre-trained machine learning emulators. Moreover, we demonstrate efficient scaling to high-dimensional parameter spaces. Second, we introduce a novel gradient-based optimization scheme that recovers the EOS of a given NS mass-radius curve. We demonstrate how our framework can reveal consistencies or tensions between nuclear physics and astrophysics. First, we show how the breakdown density of a metamodel description of the EOS can be determined from NS observations. Second, we demonstrate how degeneracies in EOS modeling using nuclear empirical parameters can influence the inverse problem during gradient-based optimization. Looking ahead, our approach opens up new theoretical studies of the relation between NS properties and the EOS, while effectively tackling the data analysis challenges brought by future detectors.",

Bibliography updated. Version accepted for publication in JCAP Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Recent data from multiple supernova catalogs and DESI, when combined with CMB, suggest a non-trivial evolution of dark energy (DE) at the $2.5-4\\sigma$ CL. This evidence is typically quantified using the CPL parametrization of the DE equation-of-state parameter which corresponds to a first-order Taylor expansion around $a = 1$. However, this truncation is to some extent arbitrary and may bias our interpretation of the data, potentially leading us to mistake spurious features of the best-fit CPL model for genuine physical properties of DE. In this work, we apply the Weighted Function Regression (WFR) method to eliminate the subjectivity associated with the choice of truncation order. We assign Bayesian weights to the various orders and compute weighted posterior distributions of the quantities of interest. Using this model-agnostic approach, we reconstruct some of the most relevant background quantities, examining the robustness of our results against variations in the CMB and SNIa likelihoods. Furthermore, we extend our analysis by allowing for negative DE. Our results corroborate previous indications of dynamical DE, now confirmed for the first time using the WFR method. The combined analysis of CMB, BAO, and SNIa data favors a DE component that transitions from phantom to quintessence at redshift $z_{\\rm cross}\\sim 0.4$. The probability of phantom crossing lies between 96.21% and 99.97%, depending on the SNIa data set used, and hence a simple monotonic evolution of the DE density is excluded at the $\\sim 2-4\\sigma$ CL. Moreover, we find no significant evidence for a negative dark energy density below $z\\sim 2.5-3$. Our reconstructions do not address the Hubble tension, yielding values of $H_0$ consistent with the Planck/$\\Lambda$CDM range. If SH0ES measurements are not affected by systematic biases, the evidence for dynamical dark energy may need to be reassessed. [abridged]",

Multiple formation channels have been proposed to explain this excess. To distinguish among these channels, it is essential to examine their predicted population-level distributions across additional parameters. In this work, we focus on BBH mergers near the $35\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ peak and infer the population distributions of primary mass ($m_1$), mass ratio ($q$), effective spin ($\\chi_{\\rm eff}$), and redshift ($z$). We observe a gradual increase in the merger rate with $m_1$, rising by a factor of $3$ from $20\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ to a peak around $34\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, followed by a sharp, order-of-magnitude decline by $50\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$. This population also shows a weak preference for equal-mass mergers and has a $\\chi_{\\rm eff}$ distribution skewed toward positive values, with a median of zero excluded at approximately $90\\%$ confidence. We find no significant $q-\\chi_{\\rm eff}$ correlation in the $35\\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ peak population, suggesting that lower-mass systems ($m_1<20\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$) likely drive the $q-\\chi_{\\rm eff}$ anti-correlation observed in the full BBH merger catalog. The redshift evolution of the merger rate is consistent with the cosmic star formation rate. We compare our findings with predictions from a wide range of formation channels. We find that common variants of the pair-instability supernova scenario, as well as hierarchical mergers, are incompatible with the observed features of the $35\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ population. Ultimately, none of the formation channels we consider can explain all or even most of the features observed in this population. The ''mid-thirties'' of black hole mergers are in crisis.",

Abac et al 2025 ApJL 993 L25 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) On 2023 November 23 the two LIGO observatories both detected GW231123, a gravitational-wave signal consistent with the merger of two black holes with masses $137^{+23}_{-18}\\, M_\\odot$ and $101^{+22}_{-50}\\, M_\\odot$ (90\\% credible intervals), at luminosity distance 0.7-4.1 Gpc and redshift of $0.40^{+0.27}_{-0.25}$, and a network signal-to-noise ratio of $\\sim$20.7. Both black holes exhibit high spins, $0.9^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and $0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.52}$ respectively. A massive black hole remnant is supported by an independent ringdown analysis. Some properties of GW231123 are subject to large systematic uncertainties, as indicated by differences in inferred parameters between signal models. The primary black hole lies within or above the theorized mass gap where black holes between 60-130 $M_\\odot$ should be rare due to pair instability mechanisms, while the secondary spans the gap. The observation of GW231123 therefore suggests the formation of black holes from channels beyond standard stellar collapse, and that intermediate-mass black holes of mass $\\sim$200 $M_\\odot$ form through gravitational-wave driven mergers.",

Mustafa Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) In this paper, we present evidence for evolving dark energy using baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2), combined with different Type Ia supernova calibrations (Pantheon$^+$, DES-SN5YR, and Union3) and the CMB compressed likelihood. In our analysis, we examined several dark energy models, including the Logarithmic, Exponential, CPL, BA, JBP, Thawing, Mirage, and GEDE parameterizations. We found that the evidence for evolving dark energy in the DESI measurements is primarily driven by the LRG1 and LRG2 tracers, as their combination yields a preferred value of $\\omega_0 > -1$. Further extending our analysis by combining other measurements, we find that all evolving dark energy models favor evolving dark energy scenario characterized by $\\omega_0 > -1$, $\\omega_a < 0$, and $\\omega_0 + \\omega_a < -1$ (Quintom-B). Indeed, our results show a departure from the $\\Lambda$CDM model at a significance level of up to $3$-$3.6\\sigma$, with the DES-SN5YR sample showing the most significant deviation. When we exclude low-$z$ SNe Ia measurements from the DES-SN5YR sample, we find that the preference for evolving dark energy is significantly biased by the low-redshift ($z < 0.01$) supernova sample. The evolution of $\\omega(z)$ shows a phantom crossing around $z \\sim 0.5$ in most of the dynamical dark energy models, and the evolution of $f_{DE}(z)$ further supports the evolving nature of dark energy. Bayesian analysis of model evidence shows that the inclusion of low-$z$ supernovae data significantly strengthens the support for evolving dark energy models such as JBP and Mirage, while models revert to inconclusive or weak support when low-$z$ data are excluded.",

Most constraints on dark energy arise from background observables -- supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the cosmic microwave background -- which mainly test the homogeneous expansion history. To move beyond this limitation, we examine how kinetic Sunyaev--Zel'dovich (kSZ) tomography, combined with galaxy clustering, can probe perturbative effects of dark energy and improve constraints on its background parameters. Using a Fisher-matrix analysis of the joint power spectra for LSST- and CMB-S4-like surveys, we quantify the additional information kSZ tomography contributes to dark-energy inference. Including kSZ data tightens constraints on $w_0$ by 15 % and on $w_a$ by 32 %, with parameter degeneracies distinct from those of geometric probes. We also assess the detectability of dark-energy perturbations through a two-parameter model, finding that for canonical sound speed ($c_s=1$) the effects are sub-percent and confined to horizon scales, while smaller sound speeds shift them to accessible $k$-ranges. Near-term kSZ measurements will primarily serve to test the consistency between background and perturbative signals, while future low-noise, high-resolution surveys may begin to uncover the microphysical properties of dark energy.",

The code is publicly available at this https URL Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph) Traditional cosmological hydrodynamical simulations usually assume equal-numbered but unequal-mass dark matter and baryonic particles, which can lead to spurious collisional heating due to energy equipartition. To avoid such a numerical heating effect, a simulation setup with equal-mass dark matter and baryonic particles, which corresponds to a particle number ratio of $N_{\\rm DM}:N_{\\rm gas} = \\Omega_{\\rm cdm} / \\Omega_{\\rm b}$, is preferred. However, previous studies have typically used grid-based particle loads to prepare such initial conditions, which can only reach specific values for $N_{\\rm DM}:N_{\\rm gas}$ due to symmetry requirements. In this study, we propose a method based on the glass approach that can generate two-component particle loads with more general $N_{\\rm DM}:N_{\\rm gas}$ ratios. The method simultaneously relaxes two Poisson particle distributions by introducing an additional repulsive force between particles of the same component. We show that the final particle load closely follows the expected minimal power spectrum, $P(k) \\propto k^{4}$, exhibits good homogeneity and isotropy properties, and remains sufficiently stable under gravitational interactions. Both the dark matter and gas components individually also exhibit uniform and isotropic distributions. We apply our method to two-component cosmological simulations and demonstrate that an equal-mass particle setup effectively mitigates the spurious collisional heating that arises in unequal-mass simulations. Our method can be extended to generate multi-component uniform and isotropic distributions. Our code based on Gadget-2 is available at this https URL .",

A statistically significant but physically small mean offset $\\langle z_{\\rm CMB} - z_{\\rm HEL} \\rangle = (-3.8 \\pm 0.1)\\times10^{-4}$ is found, exhibiting a sign reversal between low- and high-redshift subsets ($p = 3.8\\times10^{-15}$).

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) It remains debatable how billion-solar-mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) form and evolve within the first billion years. We report results from a James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRSpec integral field unit (IFU) survey of 27 luminous quasars at $z \\sim 5$-$6$, enabling a systematic investigation of their key physical properties and the associated, extended line emission. Our sample hosts SMBHs with $\\log(M_{\\mathrm{BH}}/M_\\odot) \\sim 8.6$-$9.7$ and Eddington ratios of $\\sim 0.1$-$2.6$ based on H$\\beta$, and the H$\\beta$-based and H$\\alpha$-based BH mass are broadly consistent with each other. Our sample may have a slightly smaller median BH mass and larger median Eddington ratio than lower-redshift quasars within the same luminosity range, although the difference could still be explained by statistical uncertainties. They generally follow the empirical correlations between [O III] $\\lambda$5007 equivalent width and bolometric luminosities or Eddington ratios formed by lower-redshift quasars. The majority of them fall within the Eigenvector~1 planes formed by lower-redshift quasars. Nevertheless, a subset of the sample shows enhanced, blueshifted [O III] emission associated with fast outflows. Spatially extended [O III] line emission is detected in 6 objects and shows morphologies and kinematics consistent with merging activities and/or turbulent and clumpy interstellar media (ISM). Tentative evidence of quasar radiative feedback shaping the ISM of a merging companion galaxy is seen in the object with the most extended [O III] emission. Our results provide crucial insight into the rapid growth of SMBHs and the gaseous environments they reside in at z$\\sim$5-6.",

The image simulation code is now publicly accessible at this https URL Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is a flagship space-based observatory. Its main survey camera is designed to conduct high spatial resolution near-ultraviolet to near-infrared imaging and low-resolution spectroscopic surveys. To maximize the scientific output of CSST, we have developed a comprehensive, high-fidelity simulation pipeline for reproducing both imaging and spectroscopic observations. This paper presents an overview of the simulation framework, detailing its implementation and components. Built upon the GalSim package and incorporating the latest CSST instrumental specifications, our pipeline generates pixel-level mock observations that closely replicate the expected instrumental and observational conditions. The simulation suite integrates realistic astrophysical object catalogs, instrumental effects, point spread function (PSF) modeling, and observational noises to produce accurate synthetic data. We describe the key processing stages of the simulation, from constructing the input object catalogs to modeling the telescope optics and detector responses. Furthermore, we introduce the most recent release of simulated datasets, which provide a crucial testbed for data processing pipeline developments, calibration strategies, and scientific analyses, ensuring that CSST will meet its stringent requirements. Our pipeline serves as a vital tool for optimizing CSST main survey strategies and ensuring robust cosmological measurements.",

Despite its location in the Local Void, NGC 6789 exhibits surprising recent central star formation equivalent to approximately 4% of its total stellar mass. The origin of the gas necessary for this level of star formation remains unknown. Our data reach surface brightness limits of 29.8, 29.4, and 28.9 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in the Sloan g, r, and i filters, respectively, and reveal no evidence of tidal features or merger remnants down to $\\sim$30 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ (or equivalently, at a radial distance larger than 1.6 kpc). The galaxy's undisturbed outer elliptical morphology suggests that its recent central star formation was likely produced by either in-situ residual gas or by the accretion of external pristine gas not associated with a minor merging activity.",

O'Shea, Josh Borrow, Stephanie O'Neil, Mark Vogelsberger Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics, with changes (no significant changes to results) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The splashback radius is one popular method of constraining the size of galaxy clusters, often measured through the logarithmic derivative of the galaxy number density profile. However, measuring the splashback radius through the galaxy number density has consistently produced smaller values of the splashback radius than those inferred from the underlying gravitational potential in simulations. Dynamical friction has been posited as one possible reason that splashback radii measured through galaxy number densities are reduced, since it decays the orbits of subhaloes within the halo. Dynamical friction is an emergent process, and as such, cannot be isolated or removed within N-body simulations. Here, we present simulations starting with isolated galaxy clusters drawn from the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation, where we explicitly control dynamical friction through an idealized model. We show that although dynamical friction can reduce measurements of the splashback radius, it does not have a significant effect on clusters with $M_\\mathrm{200,mean} > 10^{14} \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$, and thus cannot account for previously measured discrepancies.",

Zannoni Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The detection of B-modes in the CMB polarization pattern is a major issue in modern cosmology and must therefore be handled with analytical methods that produce reliable results. We describe a method that uses the frequency dependency of the QUBIC synthesized beam to perform component separation at the map-making stage, to obtain more precise results. We aim to demonstrate the feasibility of component separation during the map-making stage in time domain space. This new technique leads to a more accurate description of the data and reduces the biases in cosmological analysis. The method uses a library for highly parallel computation which facilitates the programming and permits the description of experiments as easily manipulated operators. These operators can be combined to obtain a joint analysis using several experiments leading to maximized precision. The results show that the method works well and permits end-to-end analysis for the CMB experiments, and in particular, for QUBIC. The method includes astrophysical foregrounds, and also systematic effects like gain variation in the detectors. We developed a software pipeline that produces uncertainties on tensor-to-scalar ratio at the level of $\\sigma(r) \\sim 0.023$ using only QUBIC simulated data.",

While these data-driven inference frameworks can be accurate on test data from the same distribution as the training sets, in real applications, it is expected that simulated training data and true observational data will differ in their distributions. We explore the behavior of a trained NRE and trained sequential NPEs to estimate the population-level parameters of dark matter subhalos from a large sample of images of strongly lensed galaxies with test data presenting distributional shifts within and beyond the bounds of the training distribution in the nuisance parameters (e.g., the background source morphology). While our results show that NREs and NPEs perform well when tested perfectly in distribution, they exhibit significant biases when confronted with slight deviations from the examples seen in the training distribution. This indicates the necessity for caution when applying NREs and NPEs to real astrophysical data, where high-dimensional underlying distributions are not perfectly known.",

Zou Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The Lyman-$\\alpha$ forests observed in the spectra of high-redshift quasars can be used as a tracer of the cosmological matter density to study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the Alcock-Paczynski effect. Extraction of cosmological information from these studies requires modeling of the forest correlations. While the models depend most importantly on the bias parameters of the intergalactic medium (IGM), they also depend on the numbers and characteristics of high-column-density systems (HCDs) ranging from Lyman-limit systems with column densities $\\log_{10}\\!\\bigl(N_{\\mathrm{HI}}/\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\bigr)>17$ to damped Lyman-$\\alpha$ systems (DLAs) with $\\log_{10}\\!\\bigl(N_{\\mathrm{HI}}/\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\bigr)>20.2$. These HCDs introduce broad damped absorption characteristic of a Voigt profile. Consequently they imprint a component on the power spectrum whose modes in the radial direction are suppressed, leading to a scale-dependent bias. Using mock data sets of known HCD content, we test a model that describes this effect in terms of the distribution of column densities of HCDs, the Fourier transforms of their Voigt profiles and the bias of the halos containing the HCDs. Our results show that this physically well-motivated model describes the effects of HCDs with an accuracy comparable to that of the ad-hoc models used in published forest analyses. We also discuss the problems of applying the model to real data, where the HCD content and their bias is uncertain.",

It is well known that spatial gradient terms lead to a failure of this approximation, particularly at the transition from slow-roll to ultra-slow-roll phase. We show that a similar breakdown also occurs during the second transition back to slow-roll when considering the evolution of $\\Pi$. Interestingly, while the homogeneous solution for $\\Pi$ accurately captures the dynamics across the first transition, it is the homogeneous solution for ${\\cal R}$ that becomes valid across the second. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the spatial curvature term introduced in the extended $\\delta N$ formalism of \\cite{Artigas:2024ajh} can be interpreted as arising from the contribution of $\\Pi$ to the energy density perturbation. Importantly, this modification of the local Hubble parameter is valid only when the first slow-roll parameter is both small and strictly constant.",

Cross-correlations of the UGRB with galaxy catalogs, cluster catalogs and weak lensing have indeed been measured. In this paper we study statistical techniques that could improve the sensitivity of the cross-correlation techniques on the bounds that can be set to the particle dark matter physical properties. The two methods that we investigate are the application of a Wiener filter and the exploitation of the full multi-tracer information. After identifying the optimal strategies, we show that the adoption of a Wiener filter in the cross-correlation analysis can improve the sensitivity to the dark matter annihilation rate by a factor of 2/2.5 as compared to the standard analysis where no filter is applied. The inclusion of the full multi-tracer information can improve the sensitivity up to a factor of 5 for dark matter masses below about 50 GeV, the Wiener filter remaining the best option for heavier dark matter.",

The data have been reanalyzed, with the main conclusions remaining unchanged. Both the figure and table have been updated, and a new section has been added to present a potential cosmological model for Model III Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The $\\Lambda$CDM cosmolgical model has long been regarded as highly successful in accurately describing a wide range of astronomical observations. However, numerous observational findings have also provided hints of discrepancies from the predictions of the $\\Lambda$CDM framework. We explore a phenomenological model that quantifies the deviation of the Hubble expansion rate from the standard scenario, which is expressed as $H^{2}(z) = H^{2}_{\\rm \\Lambda CDM}(\\Omega_m, z)[1+\\delta(z)]$. We consider three distinct forms for the deviation parameter $\\delta(z)$: in model I, $\\delta(z)=\\delta_c$; in model II, $\\delta(z)=\\delta_{c}z/(1+z)$, and in model III, $\\delta(z)=\\delta_{c}{\\rm ln}(1+z)$. Here, $\\delta_c$ represents a constant value. We utilize a comprehensive set of observational data to constrain the models. Our results show that for most combined datasets, $\\delta_c$ tends to take on negative values for models I and II, while consistently taking positive values in model III. Furthermore, we find that both models I and II remain consistent with the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model across all datasets examined. In contrast, model III exhibits a significant deviation from the $\\Lambda$CDM model, exceeding $2\\sigma$ for the full combined datastes. The AIC indicates that models I and II are consistent with the $\\Lambda$CDM model, whereas model III is preferred over the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model, with the $\\Lambda$CDM model being disfavored for the combined datasets DESI BAO + CMB + CC + DESY5. These results suggest that the Hubble expansion rate likely deviates from the standard $\\Lambda$CDM prediction.",

      "abstract": "Unified dark fluid with null sound speed as an alternative to phantom dark energy Raphaël Kou, Antony Lewis Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Recent BAO measurements from DESI, when combined with CMB and supernovae data, suggest evolving dark energy and in particular point to a possible phantom regime, with an equation of state parameter $w<-1$. We explore an alternative phenomenological way to model dark matter and dark energy based on a unified dark fluid (UDF). By construction, our model reproduces the same background expansion history as DESI's best-fit using the CPL parametrization, but assumes a vanishing rest-frame sound speed and no anisotropic stress. This simple prescription ensures a consistent and physical treatment of perturbations and, in our case, the use of a unified dark sector avoids phantom behaviour. We model CMB, LSS, and redshift-space distortion observables, and find mostly small differences with CPL, suggesting that while stage IV CMB and galaxy surveys will be able to test these models, achieving a decisive distinction between them may prove challenging on linear scales. At the non-linear level, we study spherical collapse in the UDF and show that within this framework, structure formation proceeds very similarly to standard scenarios. Using Planck, DESI BAO DR2, and DES Y5 supernovae data, we demonstrate that this simple UDF model fits current observations nearly as well as CPL, while treating perturbations consistently. Because most cosmological observations are not sensitive to how the dark sector is split, the unified framework can also approximate the phenomenology of interacting dark energy-dark matter scenarios or evolving dark matter, making it a general way to model the data, at least as long as the dark components have a vanishing sound speed, which is the most distinctive feature of our analysis. Our results highlight that a unified dark fluid with evolving equation of state and null sound speed is sufficient to pass current constraints without invoking a phantom component.",

Springer, Cham Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Machine Learning (cs.LG) Hydrogen is the most abundant element in our Universe. The first generation of stars and galaxies produced photons that ionized hydrogen gas, driving a cosmological event known as the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will map the distribution of neutral hydrogen during this era, aiding in the study of the properties of these first-generation objects. Extracting astrophysical information will be challenging, as SKAO will produce a tremendous amount of data where the hydrogen signal will be contaminated with undesired foreground contamination and instrumental systematics. To address this, we develop the latest deep learning techniques to extract information from the 2D power spectra of the hydrogen signal expected from SKAO. We apply a series of neural network models to these measurements and quantify their ability to predict the history of cosmic hydrogen reionization, which is connected to the increasing number and efficiency of early photon sources. We show that the study of the early Universe benefits from modern deep learning technology. In particular, we demonstrate that dedicated machine learning algorithms can achieve more than a $0.95$ $R^2$ score on average in recovering the reionization history. This enables accurate and precise cosmological and astrophysical inference of structure formation in the early Universe.",

Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) To date, only two strongly lensed type Ia supernovae (SNIa) have been discovered with an isolated galaxy acting as the lens: iPTF16geu and SN Zwicky. The observed image fluxes for both lens systems were inconsistent with predictions from a smooth macro lens model. A potential explanation for the anomalous flux ratios is microlensing: additional (de)magnification caused by stars and other compact objects in the lens galaxy. In this work, we combine observations of iPTF16geu and SN Zwicky with simulated microlensing magnification maps, leveraging their standardizable candle properties to constrain the lens galaxy mass slope, $\\eta$, and the fraction of dark compact objects, $f_{\\rm dc}$. The resulting mass slopes are $\\eta = 1.70 \\pm 0.07$ for iPTF16geu and $\\eta = 1.81 \\pm 0.10$ for SN Zwicky. Our results indicate no evidence for a population of dark compact objects, placing upper limits at the $95\\%$ confidence level of $f_{\\rm dc} < 0.25$ for iPTF16geu and $f_{\\rm dc} < 0.47$ for SN Zwicky (for compact objects with masses above $ 0.02 M_{\\odot}$). Assuming a constant fraction of dark compact objects for both lensed SNe, we obtain $f_{\\rm dc} < 0.19$. These results highlight the potential of strongly lensed SNIa to probe the innermost parts of lens galaxies and learn about compact matter.",

PAC measures the excess surface density of photometric objects, $\\bar{n}_2w_{\\rm{p}}$, with specific physical properties around spectroscopic tracers. In this study, we improve the PAC method to make it more rigorous and eliminate the need for redshift bins. We apply the enhanced PAC method to the DESI Y1 BGS Bright spectroscopic sample and the deep DECaLS photometric sample, obtaining $\\bar{n}_2w_{\\rm{p}}$ measurements across the complete stellar mass range, from $10^{5.3}{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ to $10^{11.5}{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ for blue galaxies, and from $10^{6.3}{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ to $10^{11.9}{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ for red galaxies. We combine $\\bar{n}_2w_{\\rm{p}}$ with $w_{\\rm{p}}$ measurements from the BGS sample, which is not necessarily complete in stellar mass. Assuming that galaxy bias is primarily determined by stellar mass and colour, we derive the galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) down to $10^{5.3}{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ for blue galaxies and $10^{6.3}{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ for red galaxies, while also setting lower limits for smaller masses. The blue and red GSMFs are well described by single and double Schechter functions, respectively, with low-mass end slopes of $\\alpha_{\\rm{blue}}=-1.54^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ and $\\alpha_{\\rm{red}}=-2.50^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$, resulting in the dominance of red galaxies below $10^{7.6}{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$. Stage-IV cosmological photometric surveys, capable of reaching 2-3 magnitudes deeper than DECaLS, present an opportunity to explore the entire galaxy population in the local universe with PAC. This advancement allows us to address critical questions regarding the nature of dark matter, the physics of reionization, and the formation of dwarf galaxies.",

Abstract abridged for arXiv (see pdf version). 49 pages, 23 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) JWST has transformed our understanding of early galaxy formation, providing an unprecedented view of the first billion years of cosmic history. In this work, we build upon our previously developed semi-analytical framework that self-consistently models the evolving UVLF of galaxies and the global reionization history while incorporating the effects of radiative feedback. Comparing our predictions with JWST and HST data, we identify a fundamental tension: models that match the UVLF fail to reproduce the observed evolution of galaxy clustering (bias) with redshift, and vice versa. To resolve this, we introduce a redshift- and mass-dependent duty cycle linked to the duration of star formation. This duty cycle increases towards higher redshifts, requiring either an enhanced production of UV radiation or increased star formation efficiency at z>10 to match the JWST UVLFs, but declines at lower redshifts (5<z<=9) and towards low-mass halos to remain consistent with the bias and HST UVLF measurements. Reconciling theory with observations requires the characteristic star formation timescale to be longer in massive halos, and to decrease with redshift at fixed halo mass, evolving from ~ 85 Myr at z=6 to ~ 45 Myr at z=14 for $10^{10} M_\\odot$ halos. Finally, our extended model, assuming a halo mass-dependent escaping ionizing efficiency ($\\varepsilon_{\\rm esc} \\equiv f_{\\rm esc} \\times \\xi_{\\rm ion}$), whose population-averaged value gradually increases with redshift and corresponds to $\\langle f_{\\rm esc} \\rangle \\sim$ 15% at z=5 for a fixed value of $\\xi_{\\rm ion} = 10^{25.23}$ erg$^{-1}$ Hz across all galaxies, produces a reionization history consistent with current constraints. These findings underscore the importance of jointly constraining high-redshift galaxy models using both UVLF and bias statistics to accurately interpret JWST data and refine our understanding of early cosmic evolution.",

We precisely measure this effect ($S/N\\approx 10$) via velocity stacking with more than 800,000 spectroscopically confirmed luminous red galaxies (LRG) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Y1 survey, which overlap with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 temperature maps over $\\geq$ 4,000 deg$^2$. We explore the kSZ dependence with various galaxy parameters and find no significant trend with redshift, but clear trends with stellar mass and absolute magnitude in $g$, $r$, and $z$ bands. Our analysis suggests that the gas extends beyond the dark matter halo (99.5\\% confidence, i.e. PTE = 0.005). We find a tentative preference for hydrodynamical simulation models with stronger feedback that drives gas further out (Illustris $z=0.5$, PTE = 0.37) over weaker-feedback cases (IllustrisTNG $z=0.8$, PTE = 0.045), though with limited statistical significance. In all cases, a free multiplicative amplitude was fit to the simulated profiles, and further modeling work is required to firm up these conclusions. We find consistency between kSZ profiles around spectroscopic and photometric LRG, with comparable statistical power, thus increasing our confidence in the photometric analysis. Additionally, we present the first kSZ measurement around DESI Y1 bright galaxy sample (BGS) and emission-line galaxies (ELG), whose features match qualitative expectations. Finally, we forecast $S/N \\sim 50$ for future stacked kSZ measurements using data from ACT, DESI Y3, and Rubin Observatory. These measurements will serve as an input for galaxy formation models and baryonic uncertainties in galaxy lensing.",

This process fails to utilise information in the data that forms a crucial part of the theories' predictions, namely which variables are directly correlated (as opposed to accidentally correlated through others), the directions of these determinations, and the presence or absence of confounders that correlate variables in the dataset but are themselves absent from it. We propose to recover this information through causal discovery, a well-developed methodology for inferring the causal structure of datasets that is however almost entirely unknown to astrophysics. We develop a causal discovery algorithm suitable for large astrophysical datasets and illustrate it on $\\sim$5$\\times10^5$ low-redshift galaxies from the Nasa Sloan Atlas, demonstrating its ability to distinguish physical mechanisms that are degenerate on the basis of correlations alone.",

Summary video (this https URL) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Recent observations from JWST have revealed unexpectedly luminous galaxies, exhibiting stellar masses and luminosities significantly higher than predicted by theoretical models at Cosmic Dawn. In this study, we present a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations targeting high-redshift ($z \\geq 10$) galaxies with dark matter halo masses in the range $10^{10} - 10^{11}\\ {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ at $z=10$, using state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulation codes (Enzo, Ramses, Changa, Gadget-3, Gadget-4, and Gizmo). This study aims to evaluate the convergence of the participating codes and their reproducibility of high-redshift galaxies with the galaxy formation model calibrated at relatively low redshift, without additional physics for high-redshift environments. The subgrid physics follows the AGORA CosmoRun framework, with adjustments to resolution and initial conditions to emulate similar physical environments in the early universe. The participating codes show consistent results for key galaxy properties (e.g., stellar mass), but also reveal notable differences (e.g., metallicity), indicating that galaxy properties at high redshifts are highly sensitive to the feedback implementation of the simulation. Massive halos (${\\rm M}_{\\rm halo}\\geq5\\times10^{10}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ at $z=10$) succeed in reproducing observed stellar masses, metallicities, and UV luminosities at $10\\leq z\\leq12$ without requiring additional subgrid physics, but tend to underpredict those properties at higher redshift. We also find that varying the dust-to-metal ratio modestly affects UV luminosity of simulated galaxies, whereas the absence of dust significantly enhances it. In future work, higher-resolution simulations will be conducted to better understand the formation and evolution of galaxies at Cosmic Dawn.",

This extension of the energy range closes the gap between direct and indirect observations of primary cosmic rays and provides the potential to test the validity of hadronic interaction models in the sub-PeV regime. Composition analyses at IceCube highly benefit from its multi-detector design. Combining the measurement of the electromagnetic shower component and low-energy muons at the surface with the response of the in-ice array to the associated high-energy muons improves the directional reconstruction accuracy and opens unique possibilities to extract the primary particle's mass. In this contribution, a new methodical approach for the analysis of these low-energy air showers is presented, including techniques for the identification of coincident background in the in-ice detector and a machine learning model based on convolutional neural networks to determine the elemental composition. The achieved performance in primary mass discrimination and energy reconstruction of air-shower events is discussed.",

Accepted by published by Universe High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Determining whether black hole jets are dominated by leptonic or baryonic matter remains an open question in high-energy astrophysics. We propose that extreme mass ratio binary (EMRB) black holes, where an intermediate mass secondary black hole (a \"miniquasar\") periodically interacts with the accretion flow of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), offer a natural laboratory to probe jet composition. In an EMRB, the miniquasar jet is launched episodically after each disk-crossing event, triggered by the onset of super-Eddington accretion. The resulting emissions exhibit temporal evolution as the jet interacts with the SMBH accretion disk. Depending on whether the jet is leptonic or hadronic in composition, the radiative signatures differ substantially. Notably, a baryonic jet produces a more pronounced gamma-ray output than a purely leptonic jet. By modeling the evolution of the multifrequency characteristic features, it is suggested that the gamma-ray-to-UV emissions may serve as a diagnostic tool capable of distinguishing between leptonic and baryonic scenarios. The resulting electromagnetic signals, when combined with multi-messenger observations, offer a powerful means to constrain the physical nature of relativistic jets from black holes.",

Considering the standard MB prescription, the initial orbital periods of LMXBs that can evolve into binary millisecond pulsar (MSP) with He white dwarfs (WDs) and short orbital periods ($2-9~\\rm hours$) are within an extremely narrow interval, which was named the fine-tuning problem. Employing the detailed binary evolution model, we investigate the evolution of LMXBs in both the standard and convection and rotation boosted (CARB) MB laws. In the standard MB case, it is difficult for donor stars to form a He core and exhaust H envelope through mass transfer at short orbital periods, making them semidetached systems. The CARB MB mechanism can drive LMXBs evolve toward compact detached MSP-WD systems in wide initial orbital periods, over which binary MSPs with long orbital periods will be produced. We obtain the initial parameter space of binary MSPs with He WDs in the initial orbital period and donor-star mass plane, which can be applied to future statistics study by population synthesis simulations. We also discuss a new relation between orbital period and WD mass, formation of persistent ultra-compact X-ray binaries with relatively long orbital periods, and detectability of compact MSP-WD systems as low-frequency gravitational wave sources.",

Latter Accepted for publication in MNRAS. 14 pages and 14 figures, including 2 pages and 6 figures in the appendix High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The magnetorotational instability (MRI) plays a crucial role in the evolution of many types of accretion disks. It is often studied using ideal-MHD numerical simulations. In principle, such simulations should be numerically converged, i.e. their properties should not change with resolution. Convergence is often assessed via the MRI quality factor, $Q$, the ratio of the Alfvén length to the grid-cell size. If it is above a certain threshold, the simulation is deemed numerically converged. In this paper we argue that the quality factor is not a good indicator of numerical convergence. First, we test the performance of the quality factor on simulations known to be unconverged, i.e. local ideal-MHD simulations with zero net-flux, and show that their $Q$s are well over the typical convergence threshold. The quality-factor test thus fails in these cases. Second, we take issue with the linear theory underpinning the use of $Q$, which posits a constant vertical field. This is a poor approximation in real nonlinear simulations, where the vertical field can vary rapidly in space and generically exhibits zeros. We calculate the linear MRI modes in such cases and show that the MRI can reach near-maximal growth rates at arbitrarily small scales. Yet, the quality factor assumes a single and well-defined scale, near the Alfvén length, below which the MRI cannot grow. We discuss other criticisms and suggest a modified quality factor that addresses some, though not all, of these issues.",

In the fall of 2024 (September--November), BL Lacertae underwent another episode of strong optical activity, reaching an R-band magnitude of about 12 and showing extremely rapid and large-amplitude inter- and intra-night flux and polarization variations. During this period, the object was monitored over 40 nights using telescopes with an aperture of up to 2 m at three observatories: Rozhen and Belogradchik in Bulgaria and Skinakas in Greece. The results from this study include some of the most spectacular intra-night variability episodes detected in a blazar. These rapid variations, combined with high photometric accuracy and high time resolution, allowed for confirmation of consistency between different optical bands with zero time delays, down to a minute scale. Unlike previous activity reports, polarization was relatively stable on these short time-scales. Possible connections between polarization, flux, and intra-night variability were explored in order to better model or constrain the physical processes and emission mechanisms in the relativistic jets.",

Cosmic rays that are accelerated in astrophysical sources can escape from their jets and interact with background radiation fields. Interactions with the extragalactic background light can produce pions and hence neutrinos, while interactions with the cosmic microwave background predominantly drive inverse Compton scattering, contributing to electromagnetic cascades in intergalactic space. The resulting secondary gamma-ray emission can be detected with high-energy gamma-ray telescopes. Here, we report on a new search for such cosmogenic cascade emission from the blazar TXS 0506+056, using a combined data set from the Fermi-Large Area Telescope and VERITAS. We compare the gamma-ray spectrum and neutrino observations with the predictions of cosmic-ray induced cascades in intergalactic space. The observed gamma-ray spectrum is modeled as a combination of the primary spectrum and the cascade spectrum. We apply a Monte Carlo simulation with a $\\Delta\\chi^2$-based likelihood analysis to jointly determine the best-fit parameters of a proton emission spectrum describing the data and derive constraints on the proton escape luminosity. Assuming a log-parabola primary photon spectrum, we find consistency with a proton injection spectral index of $\\alpha_{p} \\simeq 2.0$ and a cutoff energy of $E_{p,\\text{max}} \\simeq 1.3 \\times 10^{16}$ eV, and constrain the isotropic proton escape luminosity to $1 \\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ $\\lesssim L_{p, esc} \\lesssim 3 \\times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at the 90 % confidence level.",

Agrawal, Parijat Thakur 17 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables, Revised version, Submitted on July 11, 2025 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We perform broadband spectral and timing studies of the Galactic low-mass black hole candidate AT2019wey during its 2022 outburst, using quasi-simultaneous observations from NICER, Swift, and NuSTAR. The long-term MAXI light curve, along with the hardness-intensity diagram (HID) derived from NICER data, indicates that the source remained in the hard state and did not switch to the soft state. Spectral modeling using two different model combinations reveals that the broadband spectrum is best described by two distinct Comptonizing regions, associated reflection components, and thermal emission from the disk. The harder Comptonizing region dominates ($\\gtrsim88\\%$) the total flux and is primarily responsible for the observed reflection features from the distant part of the disk. We find that the accretion disk is truncated at a radius of $\\sim16-56~r_{\\rm{g}}$, while the luminosity is $\\sim1.9\\%$ of the Eddington limit. Our spectral results also show consistency in the estimated inner disk radius obtained through two independent methods: modeling the disk continuum and the reflection spectrum. The variability studies imply the presence of intrinsic disk variability, likely originating from an instability in the disk. We also detect hard time lags at low frequencies, possibly arising from the inward propagation of mass accretion rate fluctuations from the outer to the inner regions of the accretion disk. Moreover, an observed deviation of the lag-energy spectrum from the log-linear trend at $\\lesssim 0.7$ keV is most likely attributed to thermal reverberation, arising from the reprocessing of hard coronal photons in the accretion disk.",

Within a general-relativistic two-fluid framework that allows a covariantly conserved, gradient-driven energy exchange between baryons and the dark sector, we quantify how dark microphysics reshapes global structure when the total gravitational radius need not coincide with the luminous baryonic radius. Using a state-of-the-art baryonic equation of state, we explore the halo-forming mass range for fermionic dark matter with particle masses of 400 MeV and 1 GeV, and we characterize sequences by the difference between the total and luminous radii and by the fractional difference between the total and baryonic masses. We confirm established trends: lighter fermions typically support low-density halos that increase the total radius by several kilometers at nearly fixed mass, whereas masses near 1 GeV tend to shrink halos and make the two radii appreciably closer. Our central new result is that a percent-level vacuum-like admixture markedly reduces halo formation, shrinking the radius difference from several kilometers to sub-kilometer scales and the fractional mass difference to $\\lesssim 1\\%$. Combined gravitational-wave and X-ray observations offer a practical route to bound the halo size and the allowed vacuum-like fraction.",

Although core collapse supernovae of isolated massive stars are important, binary interactions -- such as tidal interaction, common envelope evolution, and stellar mergers -- may also play a significant role in making magnetars. Understanding the relative contributions of these channels is crucial for linking magnetars to their observed properties and host environments. In this paper, we investigate potential magnetar formation channels using population synthesis simulations, considering both single-star and isolated binary system evolution. By conducting simulations with different parameters, we compare the effects of various evolution processes on magnetar formation. Additionally, we study the delay times and kick velocities across all formation channels, analyze the orbital properties and companion types of surviving magnetar binaries. We find that the majority of magnetars are observed as single objects ($\\geq 90\\%$), although a large fraction of them were originally in binary systems and experienced either kick disruption or merger. Surviving binaries are most likely to host main-sequence companions and exhibit different distributions of eccentricities due to different supernova mechanisms. These findings show the critical role of binary evolution in magnetar formation and provide predictions for the properties of magnetar populations that can be tested with future observations.",

In this work, we perform a detailed investigation of the outflow--cloud interaction scenario for neutrino production in Seyfert nuclei. In this framework, fast AGN-driven winds collide with clumpy gas clouds in the nuclear region, forming bow shocks that efficiently accelerate cosmic-ray protons. The accelerated protons subsequently interact with cold protons from the outflows via inelastic proton--proton ($pp$) collisions, producing high-energy neutrinos, while the photomeson ($p\\gamma$) process with disk photons may provide a subdominant contribution at the highest energies. Applying this model to five neutrino-associated Seyfert galaxies, we successfully reproduce the observed TeV neutrino fluxes without violating existing gamma-ray constraints. By integrating over the Seyfert population using X-ray luminosity functions, we further demonstrate that Seyfert galaxies can account for a substantial fraction of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino background in the $10^4-10^5~{\\rm GeV}$ energy range.",

We study the physical implications of these results in this work. A phenomenological fitting shows that three components can properly give the measured structures of the proton and helium spectra. The data are then accounted for in a physically motivated, spatially-dependent propagation model. It has been shown that one background source population plus two local sources, or two background source populations plus one local source can well reproduce the measurements. The spectral structures of individual species of cosmic rays are thus natural imprints of different source components of cosmic rays. Combined with ultra-high-energy $\\gamma$-ray observations of various types of sources, the mystery about the origin of Galactic cosmic rays may be uncovered in future.",

We develop a general framework to describe vacuum resonance in a three-component plasma consisting of ions, electrons, and positrons, as expected in baryon-loaded magnetar bursts. By introducing a parametrization of the plasma composition, we establish the general criterion for the occurrence of vacuum resonance in such plasmas. Our analysis encompasses both Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein-like adiabatic mode conversion and nonadiabatic eigenmode transition, highlighting their dependence on the plasma composition. Applying this framework to baryon-loaded fireballs in magnetar bursts, we estimate the characteristic X-ray polarization signatures. Detection of these polarizations will provide observational signatures of vacuum polarization as well as baryon loading in magnetar fireballs.",

In this work, we make use of the Gaia DR3 catalog of Galactic open clusters and conduct a pulsar census, in order to identify pulsars that are either 1) current members of open clusters, or 2) escaped from open clusters to the field. Among 164 pulsars with independent distance measurements and 3530 open clusters, we find that 4 pulsars are likely residing in open clusters. In particular, we find compelling evidence that the binary pulsar J1302$-$6350 (B1259$-$63) is a member of the open cluster UBC~525; based on Gaia data, we update its distance to be $2.26\\pm 0.07$~kpc and measure the mass of its companion Be star LS 2883 to be $16.8 M_\\odot$. For 145 pulsars with both distance and proper motion measurements and 2967 open clusters with full kinematic parameters, we trace the past trajectories of both pulsars and open clusters in the Galactic gravitational potential, and find pulsars that were within 3 times the radius of a cluster. This results in 19 pulsars that were likely born in open clusters. We discuss implications for the formation history of PSR J1302$-$6350 and highlight the scientific potential of searching for pulsars in open clusters.",

The most prominent features are the three periods $P_1 = 26.5$ d, $P_2 = 26.9$ d, and $P_{\\rm long} = 4.6$ years. Occasionally, a fourth period of 26.7 d is also detected. Mathematically, these four periods are interrelated via the interference pattern of a beating. Competing scenarios that seek to determine which of these periods are physical and which are secondary are under debate. The detection of a fifth period, $P_3 = 26.3$ d, was recently claimed. Our aim is to determine which of these periods are intrinsic (likely related to physical processes) and which of these are secondary (resulting from interference). We avoided any assumption about the physical scenario and restricted our analysis to the phenomenology of the radio emission variability. We selected intervals from archival radio data and applied the generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram. We fit the observational data to generate synthetic data that only contain specific signals. We analyzed these synthetic data to assess the impact of these signals and their interference on the light curves and the periodogram. The two-peaked profile, consisting of $P_1$ and $P_2$, was detected in the periodogram of the actual data for intervals that are significantly shorter than $P_{\\rm long}$, provided that these intervals contain a minimum of the long-term modulation. The characteristics of the observational data and their periodogram could only be reproduced with synthetic data if these explicitly included all three periods $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_{\\rm long}$, the residuals being limited by noise. We have found that all three periods, i.e., $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_{\\rm long}$, could correspond to physically real processes occurring in LS I +61 303.",

Krumholz 12 pages, 11 figures, Submitted to The Open Journal of Astrophysics, Data available at this https URL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Fermi Bubbles are gamma-ray structures extending from the center of the Milky Way to +/-50 degree Galactic latitude that were discovered in data obtained by the Fermi/LAT instrument. Their origin and power source remain uncertain. To help address this uncertainty, here we use a template-free reconstruction of ten years of all-sky Fermi/LAT data provided by Platz et al. (2023) to carry out a pixel-by-pixel spectral analysis of the Bubbles. We recover the position-dependent spectral shape and normalization that would be required for parent proton or electron cosmic ray populations to produce the Bubbles' observed gamma-ray spectra. We find that models in which the gamma-ray emission is driven by either hadronic or leptonic processes can explain the data equally well. The cosmic ray population driving the emission must have either broken power-law or exponentially cut-off spectra, with break or cutoff energies that are almost constant with latitude but spectral indices below the break that harden towards the Bubbles' southern tip. For the leptonic channel, reproducing the observed position-dependent gamma-ray spectrum also requires a cosmic ray electron energy density that grows with distance from the Galactic plane and increases towards the edges of the Bubbles. This finding disfavors scenarios for the origin of the Bubbles where a population of cosmic ray electrons is accelerated near the Milky Way center and subsequently advected out to the extremities of the Bubbles.",

Accepted in MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Pulse profile modelling is a relativistic ray-tracing technique that has provided constraints on parameters, with a focus on mass and radius, of five rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. While the technique can also be applied to accretion-powered millisecond pulsars (AMPs), this requires accounting for the X-rays from the accretion disc and has only been applied to archival data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. Here, we apply a previously developed neutron star and accretion disc model to the NICER (Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer) data of the 2019 and 2022 outbursts of SAX J1808.4-3658. We find that a single circular hotspot model is insufficient to explain the data. Modelling with two hotspots and an accretion disc model provides better phase-residuals, but a spectral residual at around 1 keV remains. In contrast, we find a good fit with a flexible background approach, replacing the accretion disk. However, the inferred parameters are not robust due to a degeneracy in the origin of the non-pulsed radiation, which can be caused either by the background or a hotspot that is at least partially in view throughout a full rotation. This work represents an important next step in pulse profile modelling of AMPs by analysing NICER data and underlines the need for more accurate accretion disc and hotspot modelling to achieve robust parameter constraints. We expect the inclusion of higher energy and polarimetric data will provide complementary constraints on inclination, hotspot colatitude, and hotspot size, improving the accuracy of pulse profile modelling of AMPs.",

Marinelli High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) ANTARES, a neutrino detector located in the depths of the Mediterranean Sea, operated successfully for over 15 years before being decommissioned in 2022. The telescope offered an ideal vantage view of the Southern Sky and benefited from optimal water properties for enhanced angular resolution. This study makes use of data collected over the entire operational period of ANTARES to search for sources of high-energy cosmic neutrinos, considering both steady and flaring emission scenarios. First, a time-integrated search for high-energy neutrino clustering across the celestial sphere is conducted. The most significant accumulation is found at coordinates $(\\alpha, \\delta) =(200.5^\\circ\\, 17.7^\\circ)$ with a post-trial p-value equal to 0.38. A dedicated search in the Galactic Plane is also performed for extended sources, yielding no significant excess. Additionally, a list of potential neutrino sources are investigated. The blazar MG3 J225517+2409 is identified as the most significant object, yet the excess remains compatible with background fluctuations. A mild local excess of 2.4$\\sigma$ is found for the blazar TXS 0506+056. The full sky is also examined for the presence of flaring neutrino emissions. The most significant excess in this case corresponds to a $\\sim$4-day flare from the direction $(\\alpha, \\delta) = (141.3^\\circ\\, 9.8^\\circ)$, with a post-trial p-value of 0.30. Finally, the directions of sources highlighted in IceCube's time-dependent searches are investigated. Temporal overlaps between ANTARES and IceCube flares are identified for PKS 1502+106 and TXS 0506+056, with an estimated chance probability of about 0.02%, making this observation particularly noteworthy.",

The final average position of the different measurements is ${\\alpha = 5^{\\mathrm{h}}~ 35^{\\rm{m}}~ 27^{\\rm{s}}.9884(30)}$, ${\\delta = -69^{\\circ}~ 16'~ 11''.1134(136)}$ (ICRS J2016). The early ejecta position is located 14 mas south and 16 mas east of the ER center, with the offset being significant at 96% confidence. The offset may be due to instrument and/or filter-dependent systematics and registration uncertainties, though an intrinsic explosion offset relative to the ER remains possible. Image registration with proper motion corrections yields similar astrometry and a source proper motion of ${\\mu_{\\rm east} (\\equiv \\rm{PM_{\\alpha }*}) = 1.60 \\pm 0.15 ~\\rm{mas ~ yr^{-1}}}$ and ${\\mu_{\\rm{north}} (\\equiv \\rm{PM_{\\delta}}) = 0.44 \\pm 0.09~\\rm{mas ~ yr^{-1}}}$, in agreement with the typical local motion of the Large Magellanic Cloud. The absolute positional uncertainty of 21 mas adds a systematic uncertainty to the sky-plane kick velocity of ${123}~(t/40~\\rm{yr})^{-1}~\\rm{km~s}^{-1}$, where $t$ is the time since the explosion. Comparing the location of the compact source observed with JWST to our updated position implies a sky-plane kick of ${399\\pm148~\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$ and a 3D kick of ${472\\pm126~\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$, which is consistent with previous estimates.",

Published in ApJL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) GW231123 is a binary black hole merger whose primary component lies within or above the pair-instability mass gap, while the secondary component falls within this gap. The standard theory of stellar evolution is significantly challenged by this event. We investigate the formation of candidate progenitors of GW231123 in Population III (Pop III) star clusters. We find that they could form through stellar mergers, binary black hole mergers, and mixed mergers. The mass distribution of these candidate progenitors covers the component masses of GW231123. Under our model assumptions, their predicted merger rate density spans the range of $0.001-0.26{\\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$, encompassing that of GW231123. These findings suggest that GW231123 may originate from Pop III star clusters. Furthermore, such candidate progenitors are expected to be detectable by future gravitational wave detectors LISA/Taiji/TianQin/DECIGO/Cosmic Explorer/Einstein Telescope, which would provide valuable insights into the formation scenarios of events like GW231123.",

The source of this emission has long been thought to originate from the accretion disk, but recent studies suggest the broad line region (BLR) may significantly contribute to both the observed flux and continuum interband delays. We monitored 18 AGN over four years of observations to acquire high quality optical continuum light curves, measuring time lags between different photometric bands and determining continuum emission sizes for each AGN. We add this sample to existing lag measurements to test the correlation between continuum lags at $5100Å$ ($\\tau_{5100}$) and $5100Å$ luminosity ($L_{5100}$). We observe that $\\tau_{5100} \\propto L_{5100}^{0.4}$, broadly consistent with the theoretical expectations of $\\tau \\propto L^{1/2}$ expected for continuum reverberation from either the accretion disk or the BLR.",

Daniel Wang Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) As part of the New-ANGELS program, we systematically investigate the X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) of 4506 X-ray sources projected within a radius of 2.5 deg centering on M31. We construct XLFs for different regions in the disk and halo of M31, accounting for the incompleteness with an effective sensitivity map. Assuming that the halo regions contain (mostly) foreground stars and background active galactic nuclei, they are taken as \"background\" for deriving the XLFs of the sources in the disk. Through modeling XLFs, we decompose the X-ray sources into distinct populations for each region. We find that low-mass X-ray binaries are the dominant X-ray population throughout the disk of M31. The XLFs of M31 reveal a consistently lower integrated LMXB luminosity per stellar mass ($\\alpha_\\mathrm{LMXB}$) compared to other galaxies, likely due to M31's prolonged period of quiescent star formation. Variations in the XLF shape and $\\alpha_\\mathrm{LMXB}$ across different regions of M31 suggest that the relationship between integrated luminosity and stellar mass may vary within the galaxy. Additionally, the relatively low integrated luminosity observed in the inner-arm region provides crucial evidence for a rapid fading of M31's LMXBs around 1 Gyr, a finding consistent with recent observations of other nearby galaxies.",

Snelders accepted for publication in MNRAS, see this https URL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are sufficiently energetic to be detectable from luminosity distances up to at least seven billion parsecs (redshift $z > 1$). Probing the maximum energies and luminosities of FRBs constrains their emission mechanism and cosmological population. Here we investigate the maximum energetics of a highly active repeater, FRB 20220912A, using 1,500 h of observations. We detect $130$ high-energy bursts and find a break in the burst energy distribution, with a flattening of the power-law slope at higher energy -- consistent with the behaviour of another highly active repeater, FRB 20201124A. There is a roughly equal split of integrated burst energy between the low- and high-energy regimes. Furthermore, we model the rate of the highest-energy bursts and find a turnover at a characteristic spectral energy density of $E^{\\textrm{char}}_{\\nu} = 2.09^{+3.78}_{-1.04}\\times10^{32}$ erg/Hz. This characteristic maximum energy agrees well with observations of apparently one-off FRBs, suggesting a common physical mechanism for their emission. The extreme burst energies push radiation and source models to their limit: at this burst rate a typical magnetar ($B = 10^{15}$ G) would deplete the energy stored in its magnetosphere in $\\sim$ 2150 h, assuming a radio efficiency $\\epsilon_\\mathrm{radio} = 10^{-5}$. We find that the high-energy bursts ($E_\\nu > 3 \\times 10^{30}$ erg Hz$^{-1}$) play an important role in exhausting the energy budget of the source.",

Online material available at this https URL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We perform the first dedicated comparison of five hadronic codes (AM$^3$, ATHE$\\nu$A, B13, LeHa-Paris, and LeHaMoC) that have been extensively used in modeling of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of jetted active galactic nuclei. The purpose of this comparison is to identify the sources of systematic errors (e.g., implementation method of proton-photon interactions) and to quantify the expected dispersion in numerical SED models computed with the five codes. The outputs from the codes are first tested in synchrotron self-Compton scenarios that are the simplest blazar emission models used in the literature. We then compare the injection rates and spectra of secondary particles produced in pure hadronic cases with monoenergetic and power-law protons interacting on black-body and power-law photon fields. We finally compare the photon SEDs and the neutrino spectra for realistic proton-synchrotron and leptohadronic blazar models. We find that the codes are in excellent agreement with respect to the spectral shape of the photons and neutrinos. There is a remaining spread in the overall normalization that we quantify, at its maximum, at the level of $\\pm 40\\%$. This value should be used as an additional, conservative, systematic uncertainty term when comparing numerical simulations and observations.",

Yet, despite their astrophysical relevance, theoretical models often omit key interactions between relativistic dynamics and phase-dependent mass transfer (MT). In this study, we integrate a perturbed Keplerian formalism with post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to simulate the relativistic orbit of a WD around a rotating IMBH, explicitly resolving the narrow phase near pericentre where Roche-lobe overflow initiates MT. We find that GW emission and MT exert competing influences on the orbit: MT episodes can increase both orbital period and eccentricity, potentially enabling the WD to avoid complete tidal disruption and even escape. We further quantify the GW phase evolution induced by MT, identifying parameter regimes in which GW detectors could observe a one-radian phase shift over observational timescales. Finally, we propose that the orbital expansion driven by MT may lead to the disappearance of quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs). Our results underscore the necessity of jointly modeling relativistic effects and dynamic mass transfer in WD-IMBH systems.",

By compiling numerical simulation results for stellar collapse, we predict the expected neutrino emission and compare these predictions with observational limits from Super-Kamiokande (SK). The simulations reveal a characteristic precursor signal consisting of a short, intense burst whose average neutrino energy rises rapidly and then ceases abruptly once the black hole forms. We examine several nuclear equations of state, specifically the Lattimer \\& Swesty, Shen, Togashi, and SFHo models, to evaluate how the emission depends on neutron-star properties and nuclear-physics uncertainties. Comparison of the predicted event counts with SK's non-detection of neutrinos coincident with M31-2014-DS1 already rules out part of the model space and highlights the sensitivity of current neutrino detectors to both progenitor mass and the EOS. These findings demonstrate the capability of neutrino astronomy to probe core collapse and black hole formation in failed supernova scenarios.",

This article has been accepted for publication in \"Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan'' published by Oxford University Press High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory has detected very high-energy (VHE) gamma rays from NGC 4278, which is known to host a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN). Having only very weak radio jets, the origin of its VHE gamma rays is unclear. In this paper we first show that NGC 4278 has a massive molecular cloud surrounding the nucleus by analyzing data taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We then assume that cosmic ray protons are accelerated in a radiatively inefficient accretion flow around the supermassive black hole, which diffuse into the molecular cloud and produce gamma rays and neutrinos via $pp$ interactions. We model the gamma-ray spectra and find that the observations can be explained by such hadronic processes if the AGN activity was higher in the past than at present, and the diffusion coefficient in the molecular cloud is appreciably smaller than in the Milky Way interstellar medium. We also show that although the high-energy neutrinos co-produced with the gamma rays are unlikely to be detectable even with IceCube-Gen2, the accompanying synchrotron X-ray emission due to pion-decay secondary electrons and positrons may be detectable in the future, providing a valuable test of our hadronic model.",

Using extensive observations from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we conduct a multi-timescale periodicity search for the exceptionally active repeater FRB~20240114A. Our analysis is based on different datasets for different timescales: for short-timescale periodicity in Time of Arrivals (TOAs), we use 57 observations from January to August 2024; for long-timescale periodicity, we employ an extended TOA dataset comprising 111 observations spanning from January 2024 to October 2025; and for burst time series analysis, we utilize individual burst data from the 57 FAST observations. We identify three candidate short-timescale periodic signals (0.673~s, 0.635~s, and 0.536~s) with significances of $3.2\\sigma$--$6\\sigma$, each detected in two independent observations. On longer timescales, we detect a significant $143.40\\pm7.19$-day periodicity with $5.2\\sigma$ significance, establishing FRB~20240114A as a periodic repeater. In burst time series, we find quasi-periodic oscillations in the few hundred Hz range ($3.4\\sigma$ and $3.7\\sigma$) and periodic burst trains with periods of several to tens of milliseconds ($3\\sigma$--$3.9\\sigma$), though these periodic features appear transient and short-lived. The detection of periodic signals at these different time scales indicates that FRB 20240114A exhibits intriguing periodic self-similar characteristics. Despite the comprehensive dataset, no definitive periodicity linked to the source's rotation is confirmed, placing stringent constraints on the intrinsic source properties and the modulation mechanisms.

Wood-Vasey accepted for publication in ApJL; SLIDE is available on GitHub: this https URL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We present SLIDE, a pipeline that enables transient discovery in data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), using archival images from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) as templates for difference imaging. We apply this pipeline to the recently released Data Preview 1 (DP1; the first public release of Rubin commissioning data) and search for transients in the resulting difference images. The image subtraction, photometry extraction, and transient detection are all performed on the Rubin Science Platform. We demonstrate that SLIDE effectively extracts clean photometry by circumventing poor or missing LSST templates. We identified 29 previously unreported transients, 12 of which would not have been detected based on the DP1 DiaObject catalog. SLIDE will be especially useful for transient analysis in the early years of LSST, when template coverage will be largely incomplete or when templates may be contaminated by transients present at the time of acquisition. We present multiband light curves for a sample of known transients, along with new transient candidates identified through our search. Finally, we discuss the prospects of applying this pipeline during the main LSST survey. Our pipeline is broadly applicable and will support studies of all transients with slowly evolving phases.",

Wood-Vasey 11 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, accepted for publication in ApJL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will soon survey the southern sky, delivering a depth and sky coverage that is unprecedented in time domain astronomy. As part of commissioning, Data Preview 1 (DP1) has been released. It comprises a LSSTComCam observing campaign between November and December 2024 with multi-band imaging of seven fields, covering roughly 0.4 square degrees each, providing a first glimpse into the data products that will become available once the Legacy Survey of Space and Time begins. In this work, we search three fields for extragalactic transients. We identify eight new likely supernovae, and three known ones from a sample of 369,644 difference image analysis objects. Photometric classification using Superphot+ assigns sub-classes with >95% confidence to only one SN Ia and one SN II in this sample. Our findings are in agreement with supernova detection rate predictions of $15\\pm4$ supernovae from simulations using simsurvey. The supernova detection rate in the data is possibly affected by the lack of suitable templates. Nevertheless, this work demonstrates the quality of the data products delivered in DP1 and indicates that the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is well placed to fulfill its discovery potential in time domain astronomy.",

Characterising low-frequency emission of FRBs is vital for understanding FRB emission mechanisms and circumburst environments. We robustly characterise the 150 MHz activity CHIME-detected FRB sources relative to their 600 MHz activity -- using their non-detection in 473 h of archival observations from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) Tied-Array All-Sky Survey (LOTAAS), and 252 h of LOFAR observations of 14 repeating FRB sources, the largest sub-300 MHz targeted FRB campaign to date. In the LOTAAS data, we search for repeat bursts from 33 CHIME/FRB repeaters, 10 candidate repeaters and 430 apparent non-repeaters. Their non-detection yields a population-level constraint on the statistical spectral index $\\alpha_{s, 150MHz/600MHz}>-0.9$, indicating that FRB spectral indices are, on average, flatter than known spectral indices from pulsars. From the targeted campaign, we find that the prolific repeater FRB 20201124A shows a positive $\\alpha_s>0.55$, implying reduced low-frequency activity, unlike the typically negative $\\alpha_{s}$ seen from FRBs at higher frequency bands. We explore free-free absorption in the circumburst environment as a cause of the non-detection at 150 MHz. The non-detection of FRB 20201124A is consistent with either a very young $\\sim10$ yr old supernova remnant, or a typical HII region. Our simulations indicate that LOFAR2.0 can detect 0.3-9 FRBs per week, and up to 4 FRBs at redshifts in the range $1<z<3$. Such detections will provide robust constraints on cosmological parameters due to their clean environments. Our results guide future low-frequency FRB searches by showing how even non-detections can place meaningful constraints on the repetition rates and circumburst environments of FRBs.",

During the orbital decay of the inner BHB, the apsidal precession rate of the inner binary matches that of the outer stellar orbit, and this resonance advection can drive the outer eccentricity into some extreme values. For a Gaia BH3-like system, we show that a near equal-mass ($q=0.8$) BHB with an initial semi-major axis of 1--3 au and an initial eccentricity $\\gtrsim 0.95$ is able to excite the outer orbit to the observed value, leaving a current BHB with semi-major axis 0.25--0.5 au and eccentricity $\\sim 0.8$. The eccentric inner BHB imprints two observable signatures on the outer star: (1) short-term RV modulations with an amplitude $\\lesssim 100$ m/s and (2) long-term apsidal precession with a rate $\\lesssim 0.1^{\\circ}$/yr. Although neither of these is detected in the currently available astrometry and RV data, we show that these signals are detectable with the full Gaia astrometry data and dedicated high-precision and/or long-term RV observations. Our work provides a new perspective on the dynamical formation of Gaia BH3, and the methodology is readily applicable to similar systems such as HD 130298, Gaia BH1, and Gaia BH2.",

Accepted for publication in A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Aims. The accretion disk of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) is a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF). Our goal is to find evidence of RIAF radiation from LLAGNs with jets and analyze their radiation properties, which also adds samples to future research on LLAGNs. Methods. Weconducted an analysis of the X-ray data obtained from NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations of NGC 315 and NGC 4261, encompassing both timing and spectral investigations. The joint X-ray spectra of the two LLAGNs were fitted using various functional forms and radiative models in XSPEC. Results. No significant variability on timescales of days is observed for both NGC 315 and NGC 4261. The X-ray continuum emission of NGC 315 is suitable for cutoff power-law (PL) fitting, yielding a cutoff energy of Ecut = 18.45 keV, which is the lowest value found in LLAGNssofar. In contrast, the X-ray continuum of NGC 4261 is composed of two PL components, with no signs of a cutoff energy. A prominent neutral Fe K{\\alpha} line is observed in NGC 315, while an ionized Fe XXV line is seen in NGC 4261. The derived reflection fractions are R = 0.61 for NGC 315 and R = 0.18 for NGC 4579. Neither NGC 315 nor NGC 4261 shows evidence of a Compton reflection bump. Conclusions. The X-ray spectral characteristics support the RIAF emission as the dominant origin of the X-rays in both sources, although an additional soft PL component originating from the inner jet is observed in NGC 4261. The higher reflection fraction compared to other LLAGNs, along with the detection of a neutral Fe K{\\alpha} line, suggests the existence of a truncated accretion disk with a relatively small radius in NGC 315. Bremsstrahlung radiation appears to be the dominant cooling mechanism for the plasma in NGC315, while Comptonization within the RIAF is more likely responsible for the X-ray emission in NGC 4261.",

For this purpose, we used Artificial Neural Network based interpolation to reconstruct the luminosity distance corresponding to the GRB redshift. We then use two independent GRB datasets to test the robustness of the Amati relation at redshifts below $z=2.6$. Our best-fit Amati relation parameters are consistent for the same datasets to within $1\\sigma$. The intrinsic scatters which we obtain for the two datasets of about 28\\% and 35\\%, are comparatively larger.

      "abstract": "Cosmological Evolution of Gamma Ray Bursts Sujay Champati, Vahé Petrosian, Maria G. Dainotti High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are classified as long (LGRBs) and short (SGRBs) with collapsars and compact object mergers (neutron star (NS)-NS or NS-Black hole) as progenitors, respectively. The former are expected to follow the cosmic star formation rate (SFR), while the latter follows a delayed version of the SFR. However, this division has come under question in several ways, the most prominent being the observational evidence of a significant excess of LGRBs at low redhifts by several independent investigations, summarized in arXiv:2305.15081. This could indicate that the progenitors of low-redshift LGRBs, whose formation rates are delayed, (similar to that of SGRBs) are compact mergers rather than collapsars. Two recent observations of low-redshift LGRBs show associations with kilonovae, a clear feature of compact mergers. Most results showing this separation are based on analyses of small (less than 200) samples of LGRBs with measured redshifts. The aim of this paper is to use a larger sample of LGRBs. The number of LGRBs with measured redshifts has increased by more than a factor of 2 over the last decade. To this data set we add a sample of LGRBs whose redshifts are estimated using a machine learning (ML) method (arXiv:2410.13985). This, in addition to increasing the sample size, reduces the observational selection bias arising from the process of redshift measurement. To account for this bias, we use the non-parametric, non-binning Efron-Petrosian method to establish the degree of correlation between luminosity and redshift, the luminosity evolution, which then allows us to use the Lynden-Bell $C^-$ method to obtain a complete description of the luminosity function. We find similar low redshift excess for the larger sample with measured redshifts. Adding the sources with ML-estimated redshifts, which tend to have more sources in mid-range redshifts, the excess is reduced.",

Karthik Yadavalli, Qinan Wang High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) In this paper, we first present observations of SN~2024acyl, a normal Type Ibn supernova with a large projected offset ($\\sim$35~kpc) from its host galaxy. The low star-formation rate measured at the explosion site raises the possibility that the progenitor of SN~2024acyl may not have been a massive star. We then examine, more broadly, the spectral diversity of Type Ibn supernovae around 20--35 days after peak brightness and identify two distinct groups: Group I, which shows bluer rest-frame optical color and narrower He~I emission lines; and Group II, which shows redder rest-frame optical color and broader He~I lines. Group~I also tends to show higher peak luminosities. The diversity we identify appears to be closely connected to the diversity observed around peak and to persist into late phases ($>80$ days after peak). Given its redder color and broader He~I lines, we classify SN~2024acyl as belonging to Group II. Based on the current dataset, we find no clear connection between this spectral diversity and either the host environments of Type Ibn SNe or their pre-explosion activity. The observed diversity in Type Ibn SNe likely reflects differences in circumstellar material properties and/or explosion energetics. These differences could result from a range of progenitor properties, such as different helium star mass, orbital period and companion type if they are in binary systems, and may indicate fundamentally diverse progenitors. Whether a continuous distribution exists between the two groups remains to be determined and will require further data to explore.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of certain BL Lac objects (BL Lacs) exhibit an additional hard $\\gamma$-ray component in the TeV energy range that surpasses the predictions of the one-zone leptonic jet model. The origin of this excess emission remains unclear. In this study, we selected five BL Lacs whose SEDs display a very hard intrinsic spectrum in the TeV band and successfully reproduced their broadband SEDs using a two-zone lepto-hadronic model. Within this framework, the emission observed in the optical, X-ray, GeV $\\gamma$-ray, and sub-TeV $\\gamma$-ray bands is modeled using the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton radiation processes of the relativistic electrons in the jets. Meanwhile, the TeV excess is attributed to $\\gamma$-ray emission resulting from the photomeson ($p\\gamma$) process via $\\pi^0$ decay occurring within advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). This scenario requires a hard proton spectrum with a spectral index of $p \\sim 1.6-1.7$ and a cutoff energy ranging from 30 to 90 TeV, as well as a relatively large ADAF radius. Such hard proton spectra suggest that the dominant acceleration mechanisms are likely magnetic reconnection and/or stochastic acceleration processes within ADAFs. Additionally, the emission from the cascaded electrons results in a bump in the keV--MeV band; however, it is overwhelmed by the jet emission. Although the hadronuclear ($pp$) process cannot be entirely ruled out, it would necessitate an even harder proton spectrum and a higher cutoff energy compared to the $p\\gamma$ process, making it a less favorable explanation for the observed TeV excess.",

However, the observational verification of such a fundamental relation is still lack due to the difficulty of measuring the spectra of individual particles from one (kind of) source(s) up to very high energies. This work reports direct measurements of the carbon, oxygen, and iron spectra from ~ 20 gigavolts to ~ 100 teravolts (~ 60 teravolts for iron) with 9 years of on-orbit data collected by the Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE). Distinct spectral softenings have been directly detected in these spectra for the first time. Combined with the updated proton and helium spectra, the spectral softening appears universally at a rigidity of ~ 15 teravolts. A nuclei mass dependent softening is rejected at a confidence level of > 99.999%. Taking into account the correlated structures at similar energies in the large-scale anisotropies of cosmic rays, one of the most natural interpretations of the spectral structures is the presence of a nearby cosmic ray source. In this case, the softening energies correspond to the acceleration upper limits of such a source, forming the so-called Peters cycle of the spectra. The results thus offer observational verification of the long-standing prediction of the charge-dependent energy limit of cosmic ray acceleration.",

Grech Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Electromagnetic showers from high-energy electron beams interacting with a target are a promising path to creating pair plasmas in the laboratory. Here, we solve analytically the kinetic equations describing this process. Two regimes are defined by the ratio of the target thickness $L$ to the shower length $L_{\\rm{sh}}$, which depends on the electron energy and target composition. For thin targets ($L < L_{\\rm{sh}}$), we derive explicit expressions for the spectra of produced photons and pairs, as well as the number of pairs. For thick targets ($L > L_{\\rm{sh}}$), we obtain the total pair number and photon spectrum. Analytical results agree well with Geant4 simulations, and it is found that significant pair escape requires $L < L_{\\rm{sh}}$. The divergence, density and characteristic dimensions of the escaping pair jets are derived, and a criterion for pair plasma formation is obtained. While current laser wakefield beams are not well adapted, multi-petawatt lasers may provide new electron or photon sources suitable for laboratory pair plasma production.",

We cover non-rotating solar-metallicity progenitors spanning an initial mass between 10 and about 40Msun and exploding as Type II or Ibc supernovae (SNe). Both photometrically and spectroscopically, the SN II models evolve distinctly from the SN Ibc models primarily because of the greater ejecta kinetic-energy-to-mass ratio in the latter, which leads to a greater gamma-ray escape together with a lower density and a higher ionization in our H-deficient ejecta. Type II SN models remain optically luminous at all times, whereas Type Ibc models progressively brighten in the infrared (which holds 80% of their luminosity at 500d), causing strong infrared lines such as [NeII]12.810mic and [NiII]6.634mic to evolve essentially at constant luminosity. The strength of [NeII]12.810mic exhibits a complicated dependence with either He-core or preSN mass because of the additional impact of ejecta ionization -- this line radiates alone up to 20% of the SN luminosity after ~300d in our Type Ibc SN models. The numerous infrared Ni lines are found to be good tracers of the material that underwent explosive nucleosynthesis and can thus be used directly to constrain the level of 56Ni mixing in core-collapse SNe. The evolution of the integrated flux in infrared Fe and Co lines shows a great amount of diversity, which compromises their use as a diagnostic of the 56Ni-decay power source in our models. Future spectroscopic observations of core-collapse SNe by JWST will provide unprecedented information on the emission from atoms and ions in their ejecta, delivering critical constraints on massive star explosions.",

Although the optical regions dominate the observed flux, SN2024ggi is bright at infrared wavelengths (65%/35% falls each side of 1mic). SN2024ggi exhibits a plethora of emission lines from H, He, intermediate-mass elements (O, Na, Mg, S, Ar, Ca), and iron-group elements (IGEs; Fe, Co, and Ni) -- all lines have essentially the same width, suggesting efficient macroscopic chemical mixing of the inner ejecta at <~2000km/s and little mixing of 56Ni at larger velocities. Molecular emission in the infrared range is dominated by the CO fundamental, which radiates about 5% of the total SN luminosity. A molecule-free radiative-transfer model based on a standard red-supergiant star explosion (i.e., ~1e51erg, 0.06Msun of 56Ni from a 15.2Msun progenitor) yields a satisfactory match throughout the optical and infrared at both epochs. The SN2024ggi CO luminosity is comparable to the fractional decay-power absorbed in the model C/O-rich shell -- accounting for CO cooling would likely resolve the model overestimate of the [OI]0.632mic flux. The relative weakness of the molecular emission in SN2024ggi and the good overall match obtained with our molecule-free model suggests negligible microscopic mixing -- about 95% of the SN luminosity is radiated by atoms and ions. Lines from IGEs, which form from explosion ashes at such late times, are ideal diagnostics of the magnitude of 56Ni mixing in core-collapse SN ejecta. Stable Ni, clearly identified in SN2024ggi (e.g., [NiII]6.634mic), is probably a common product of massive-star explosions.",

Wright Submitted to ApJ. 30 pages, 17 figures, 2 tables; comments welcomed Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Observing the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in emission lines from ionized gas enables direct mapping of its spatial and kinematic structure, offering new insight into the gas flows that regulate galaxy evolution. Using the high-resolution Figuring Out Gas & Galaxies In Enzo (FOGGIE) simulations, we generate mock emission-line maps for six Milky Way-mass halos. Different ions (e.g., HI, OVI) trace distinct CGM phases and structures, highlighting the importance of observations in multiple species. We quantify the observable CGM mass fraction as a function of instrument spatial resolution and surface brightness sensitivity, finding that sensitivity is the dominant factor limiting detectability across all ions. At fixed sensitivity, higher spatial resolution reveals more structures; at fixed spatial resolution, higher sensitivity recovers a higher percentage of the total mass. We explore CGM kinematics by constructing emissivity-weighted projected velocity maps and comparing line-of-sight velocities between ions. OVI shows the largest kinematic deviation from HI, while MgII and SiII most closely follow HI velocities. Distinguishing these phases out to 50kpc from the galaxy center requires spectral resolution better than 30km/s for most ion pairs. Additionally, separating inflowing from outflowing gas based on projected kinematics also requires high spectral resolution: at 30km/s, more than 80% of gas above the emission detection threshold can be distinguished kinematically, but this fraction drops to <40% with a resolution of 200km/s. Our results provide predictions for future UV and optical instruments, showing that recovering the multiphase structure and kinematics of circumgalactic emission will require both high sensitivity and fine kinematic resolution.",

Despite the extreme overdensity, the resident galaxies exhibit star-formation histories, UV-slopes and neutral hydrogen column densities that are consistent with those of field galaxies at similar redshifts. This is in stark contrast with the consistently high neutral hydrogen column densities, old stellar populations and large dust masses of galaxies within a $z=7.88$ protocluster in the Abell 2744 field. Comparison with the TNG-Cluster and TNG300 simulations indicates a halo mass of ${\\rm log_{10}}(M_{200{\\rm c}}[{\\rm M_{\\odot}}]) = 11.4\\pm0.2$, and implies that, on average, SMACS-PC-z7p7 will evolve into a present-day Fornax-like cluster (${\\rm log_{10}}(M_{200{\\rm c},\\ z=0}[{\\rm M_{\\odot}}]) = 13.7\\pm0.6$). The uniformly young, highly star-forming nature of the galaxy population of SMACS-PC-z7p7 suggests that environmental effects only become significant above halo masses of ${\\rm log_{10}}(M_{200{\\rm c}}[{\\rm M_{\\odot}}]) \\gtrsim 11.5$. Comparison to other $z\\gtrsim7$ protoclusters reveals that vigorous star formation persists in lower-mass protoclusters, whereas accelerated evolution and suppression of star formation emerge in more massive haloes. SMACS-PC-z7p7 therefore represents an early stage of protocluster assembly, where residence within an overdense environment still enhances star formation, and feedback processes have yet to exert a significant influence.",

To properly validate and characterise the family of galactic progenitors, it is important to take into account all the effects that can shape the distribution of tracers in the Galaxy. First among the often overlooked actors of galactic dynamics is the rotating bar of the Milky Way that can affect orbital tracers in multiple ways. We want to fully characterise the effect of the rotating bar of the Milky Way on the distribution of galactic tracers, provide diagnostics helpful in identifying its effect and explore the implications for the search and identification of substructures. We use the in-house Orbital Integration Tool (OrbIT), built to include the full effect of the bar and exploit its multidimensional output to perform a complete dynamical characterisation of a large sample of carefully selected Milky Way stars with very precise astrometry. We identify conspicuous overdensities in several orbital parameter spaces and verify that they are caused by the bar-induced resonances. We also show how contamination by trapped tracers provides local density enhancements that mimic the clumping usually attributed to genuine substructures. We provide a new and expedite way of identifying resonant loci and, consequently, to estimate the contribution of stars trapped into orbital resonances to phase-space overdensities previously identified as candidate relics of past merging events. Among those analysed here, we found that the detections of Cluster 3 and Shakti seem to have gained a non-negligible boost from resonance-trapped stars. Nyx is the most extreme case, with 70% of assigned member stars lying on resonant orbit, strongly suggesting that it is not the genuine relic of a merger event but an overdensity caused by bar-induced resonances",

Read, Oscar Agertz, Alexander P. Ji, Jennifer Mead, Kaley Brauer, Mordecai-Mark Mac Low Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The chemical abundances of stars in galaxies are a fossil record of the star formation and stellar evolution processes that regulate galaxy formation, including the stellar initial mass function, the fraction and timing of type Ia supernovae (SNeIa), and nucleosynthesis inside massive stars. In this paper, we systematically explore uncertainties associated with modeling chemical enrichment in dwarf galaxies. We repeatedly simulate a single EDGE-INFERNO dwarf ($M_{\\star} \\approx 10^5 \\, M_{\\odot}$), varying the chemical yields of massive stars, the timing and yields of SNeIa, and the intrinsic stochasticity that arises from sampling individual stars and galaxy formation chaoticity. All simulations are high-resolution (3.6 pc), cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamical simulations that track the stellar evolution of all individual stars with masses $>0.5\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$. We find that variations in SNIa assumptions make the largest difference in mean abundance ratios and [Fe/H], highlighting the importance of detailed SNIa modeling even in such low-mass reionization-limited galaxies. In contrast, different massive star yields, accounting (or not) for stellar rotation, result in mean abundances comparable to those arising from stochasticity. Nonetheless, they significantly affect the shape of abundance trends with [Fe/H], for example, through the existence (or not) of a bimodality in the [X/Fe] - [Fe/H] planes, particularly in [Al/Fe]. Finally, we find that the variance arising from random sampling severely limits the interpretation of single galaxies. Our analysis showcases the power of star-by-star cosmological models to unpick how both systematic uncertainties (e.g., assumptions in low-metallicity chemical enrichment) and statistical uncertainties (e.g., averaging over enough galaxies and stars within a galaxy) affect the interpretation of chemical observables in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies.",

The processed light curves are available on Zenodo at DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14930797 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) In our previous work, we applied the ICCF-Cut method to the continuum reverberation mapping (CRM) of six active galactic nuclei (AGNs) based on the published Swift data. Extending this work, we perform a systematic AGN CRM study utilizing the Swift archive. We enlarge our sample with eight additional AGNs at $z<0.05$ with high-cadence ($<3$ days) and multiband photometric observations. Time series analysis of these light curves shows two main results: (1) The interband lags are broadly consistent with $\\tau \\propto \\lambda^{4/3}$, while the average interband lags are larger than those predicted by the standard thin accretion disk model. (2) For most targets, there exists a $U$ band lag excess, which is probably due to the diffuse continuum emission from the broad-line region (BLR). We employ the ICCF-Cut method to extract the possible diffuse continuum component from the $U$ band light curves and calculate the diffuse continuum lags ($\\tau_{\\rm cut}$), which are generally consistent with the lags ($\\tau_{\\rm jav}$) derived by the JAVELIN Photometric Reverberation Mapping Model. Further analysis with our sample indicates a positive correlation between the diffuse continuum region size and the BLR size ($R_{\\rm DCR}-R_{\\rm BLR}$ relation), as well as another correlation with the luminosity ($R_{\\rm DCR}-L$ relation). These findings provide further evidence for a significant contribution of diffuse continuum emission from the BLR to the AGN continuum lags.",

The paper has been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal (ApJ) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Protostellar jets provide valuable insight into the evolutionary stage and formation history of star-forming cores in their earliest phases. We investigated the inner envelope structures of three extremely young protostars, selected for having the shortest dynamical timescales in their outflows and jets. Our analysis is based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the N2D+, DCO+, DCN, C18O, CH3OH, and H2CO lines, along with 1.3 mm continuum data, obtained at two spatial resolutions of ~500 AU and 150 AU. By examining molecular depletion and sublimation patterns, emission extents at core-scale and outflow rotational temperatures, we assessed the relative evolutionary stages of the three sources. In G208.68-19.20N1, the absence of N2D+ toward the core-despite a semi-ring-like distribution-and the presence of bright DCN and DCO+ emission cospatial with C18O indicate a warmer envelope, possibly suggesting a more advanced evolutionary state. In contrast, G208.68-19.20N3 shows no dense central structures in C18O, DCN, DCO+, or N2D+, with emission instead appearing scattered around the continuum and along large-scale filaments, consistent with a likely younger stage than G208.68-19.20N1. The third source, G215.87-17.62M, exhibits compact C18O emission at the continuum peak, but spatially extended N2D+, DCN, and DCO+ along the continuum, pointing to a cooler envelope and likely the youngest stage among the three. This comparative analysis across three protostars demonstrates the effectiveness of molecular tracers for evolutionary staging, though variations in luminosity or accretion may also shape chemical morphologies. These results highlight the promise of broader surveys for advancing our understanding of early protostellar evolution.",

Using the Lijiang 2.4-meter telescope, we obtained 74 spectra with a median cadence of 1.9 days. Through detailed spectral decomposition, we measured the light curves of the optical continuum at 5100~Å and the broad He~{\\sc ii}, He~{\\sc i}, H$\\gamma$, and H$\\beta$ emission lines. The time lags of these lines relative to the continuum are measured as $1.3^{+1.6}_{-0.6}$, $2.3^{+1.5}_{-2.1}$, $10.0^{+2.0}_{-1.8}$, and $15.6^{+2.6}_{-2.9}$ days (rest-frame), respectively. Velocity-resolved lag profiles for H$\\gamma$ and H$\\beta$ were constructed. Combined with data from previous seasons (2015$-$2021), we find that the radial ionization stratification of the broad-line region (BLR) is stable; the average virial mass of the supermassive black hole in NGC~5548 is $(2.6\\pm1.1)\\times 10^{8}M_{\\odot}$, consistent with the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma_*$ relation; the broad He~{\\sc ii} line exhibits the largest responsivity, followed by broad He~{\\sc i} (or H$\\gamma$) and H$\\beta$ lines; the BLR kinematics show significant temporal evolution, transitioning from virialized motions to signatures of inflow and outflow. Furthermore, an analysis of 35 years of historical data confirms a 3.5-year time lag between variations in the optical luminosity and the BLR radius, potentially implicating the role of radiation pressure or dynamical structure changes in the inner accretion disk. Long-term campaign demonstrates that the BLR in NGC 5548 is a robust yet dynamically evolving entity, providing crucial insights into AGN structure and accretion physics.",

Laigle, A. Boselli, K. Kraljic, C. Stone Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The discovery of the large-scale structure has transformed our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Filaments of the cosmic web provide key environments that channel the growth of structures. Guided by predictions from cosmological simulations, we study the morphological distribution of galaxies in the Perseus-Pisces Supercluster, a prominent filamentary complex at 70 Mpc. We focus on how galaxy morphology and structural disturbances relate to position within the filament network and to proximity to dense nodes. Our sample is built from a spectroscopic catalogue cross-matched with deep r-band CFHT/MegaCam imaging from UNIONS and additional time, enabling the detection of low-surface-brightness features and extended outer structures. Morphologies are determined both visually and through structural parameters extracted from surface-brightness profiles using AutoProf and AstroPhot. The 3D filamentary skeleton of Perseus-Pisces is reconstructed with the DisPerSE algorithm, providing distances from each galaxy to the nearest filament and to group or cluster centres. The 3D mapping reveals a network of interconnected sub-filaments converging around the Pisces cluster, forming a complex, multi-branched structure that likely shapes environmental effects on galaxy evolution. We observe clear morphological and stellar-mass segregation: massive early-type galaxies (E/S0) concentrate along filament spines and near dense nodes, while late-type and irregular systems are more broadly dispersed. About 10-13% of galaxies show strong signs of gravitational interaction, with stellar-halo asymmetries particularly common in filaments and groups. These findings underline the dual influence of filamentary environments, which both host evolved early-type systems and foster local tidal interactions and pre-processing that modify galaxy morphology.",

The former likely results from AGN-driven biconical outflows, while the absence of a broad H$\\beta$ supports a classification of the source as a Type-1.9 AGN. We analyze its high-quality Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) optical spectrum after robustly subtracting host galaxy and AGN continuum contributions through a simple stellar population fitting method employing 39 templates and a power-law continuum. Each narrow line of the [O~{\\sc iii}]$\\lambda\\lambda4959,5007$Å doublet is better described by two Gaussian components (blue-shifted and red-shifted) than by a single Gaussian, as confirmed by the F-test. Broad components are included for both H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$, but only H$\\alpha$ reveals a significant detection, further supported by a comparison between the SDSS spectrum and that previously reported. These results support that the object is highly consistent with a Type-1.9 AGN classification, and the double-peaked [O~{\\sc iii}] profiles are most likely produced by AGN-driven biconical outflows rather than by a rotating narrow-line region or a dual AGN merger system. Additional observations are still needed to strengthen these conclusions.",

This study aims to investigate whether M31's present location is aligned with the center of its distribution of dwarf galaxies. We use forward modeling to infer the center of the M31 satellite 3D spatial distribution, folding in the completeness of dwarf galaxy searches. We observe a displacement of the center of the satellite distribution, relative to the center of M31, of approximately 10--50 kpc towards the Milky Way. Nonetheless, the center of M31 remains compatible with the center of the dwarf galaxy distribution given the broad constraints on its position, with the significance of the shift ranging from $\\leq 1\\sigma$ to $1.9\\sigma$, depending on the assumed form of the volumetric spatial distribution of satellites. If M31 is truly offset from its satellite system, a quadrupling of the number of known satellites would be necessary to infer a significant ($3\\sigma$) offset. Hence, expanding the number of known dwarf galaxies is crucial to deepen our understanding of the distribution of M31 satellites and further shed on its peculiar structure.",

The short-lived, sporadic, and anisotropic nature of radio activities, coupled with the detection of abundant cold gas around some massive quiescent galaxies, raise questions about the efficiency of radio feedback in massive galaxies. Here we present an innovative method rooted in artificial intelligence to separate galaxies in which radio feedback is effective (RFE), regardless of current radio emission, from those in which radio feedback is ineffective (RFI), according to their optical images. Galaxies categorized as RFE are all dynamically hot, whereas quiescent RFI (RFI-Q) galaxies usually have extended cold-disk components. At given stellar mass, dark matter halos hosting RFE galaxies are between four to ten times more massive than those of RFI-Q galaxies. We find, for the first time, that almost all RFE galaxies have scant cold gas, irrespective of AGN activity. In contrast, many RFI-Q galaxies are surrounded by substantial amounts of condensed atomic gas, indicating a different evolutionary path from RFE galaxies. Our finding provides direct and compelling evidence that a radio AGN has gone through about 300 on-off cycles and that radio feedback can prevent gas cooling over a timescale much longer than that of radio activity. Contrary to general belief, our analysis shows that only a small fraction of massive galaxies are influenced by strong radio AGNs, suggesting that current galaxy formation models need serious revision.",

Zaporozhchenko Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The dynamics of globular clusters in the Fornax dwarf galaxy pose a challenge for the standard cold dark matter (CDM) and can be used to test other models of dark matter. We study this dynamics in the context of ultralight bosonic dark matter model, accounting for the damping term in a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Employing analytic formulas for the dynamical friction force, the infall time and evolution of globular clusters are compared in the cases with and without the damping term. It is argued that the damping term plays an important role for the Fornax timing problem in ultralight dark matter models.",

      "abstract": "NbodyCP:A direct N-body simulation code for composite stellar populations of single and binary star clusters Zhongmu Li, Rainer Spurzem Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) It is well-known that some star clusters contain composite stellar populations (CSPs), in which the metallicities or (and) ages of stars are different. The formation and evolution of such clusters and their stellar populations remain unclear. Both single and binary cluster channels may lead to such CSPs. In order to simulate the formation and evolution of such CSPs in star clusters, this work develops a code of direct N-body simulation of CSPs, NbodyCP. It is applied to different clusters, in particular, to binary clusters. It shows that CSPs and different kinds of cluster pairs can be formed via dynamical processes. This will help to partially explain the formation of CSPs and various clusters. Some special cluster structures, e.g., two cores or bar-like shape, are shown to be the results of evolution of some binary clusters. The simulation also shows that the separation between the members of a binary cluster affects the time of two member clusters to combine or move away significantly.",

Wucknitz Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We seek to exploit the expanded observational range of the MeerKAT radio telescope with the new S-band receivers (2.0-2.8 GHz). To showcase its enhanced capabilities, we conducted new S-band observations of the galaxy NGC 2997 in full polarization. The S band is ideal for studying magnetic fields in spiral galaxies due to the weak Faraday depolarization. Performing a rotation measure (RM) synthesis allowed us to measure Faraday RMs in the galaxy, a signature of regular magnetic fields. A fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm was used to study the various azimuthal modes found in the RM data of the galaxy. The RM synthesis analysis indicates the direction of the magnetic field along the line of sight throughout the entire disk. Leveraging the sensitivity and high resolution provided by MeerKAT's S-band capability, this study achieves an unprecedented level of detail of the magnetic field structure. Our sector-based analysis of the RMs across azimuthal regions reveals the existence of modes of the large-scale magnetic field in NGC 2997. The variations in the RM values along the azimuthal angle reveal smoothly changing phase shifts between the rings, without the previously reported field reversal at about 3 kpc radius between the central region and disk. In this work, for the first time, a Fourier analysis has been applied to RM data averaged in sectors of rings in the disk plane of a spiral galaxy. Our Fourier analysis of the RM map shows three different large-scale field modes detected in the disk of NGC 2997. After applying a geometric modification, even multiples of the first mode were detected, as predicted from theoretical studies of dynamo action in a spiral galaxy with symmetric spiral structure. Our new method opens up new possibilities for investigating magnetic fields in spiral galaxies.",

These maps are utilized to calibrate the PAH features as star formation rate (SFR) indicators in 40 pc size regions around massive emerging young star clusters (eYSCs). We find a tight, sub-linear (power-law exponent, $\\alpha{\\,}{\\sim}{\\,}0.8$) relation between the PAH luminosities (3.3 and 7.7 $\\mu$m) and SFR (extinction corrected Pa$\\alpha$) in near solar metallicity environments. PAH destruction in more intense ionizing environments and/or variations in the age of our sources may drive the deviation from a linear relation. In the metal-poor environment of NGC 4449 (${\\sim}$1/3 Z$_{\\odot}$), we see substantial deficits in the PAH feature strengths at fixed SFR and significantly higher scatter in the PAH-SFR relations. We determine that the 3.3/7.7 $\\mu$m PAH luminosity ratio increases towards lower metallicity environments. This is interpreted as a result of a shift in the size distribution towards smaller PAHs at lower metallicities, possibly due to inhibited grain growth. Focusing on the regions in NGC 4449, we observe a decreasing 3.3/7.7 $\\mu$m ratio towards higher SFR, which could indicate that small PAHs are preferentially destroyed relative to larger PAHs in significantly sub-solar metallicity conditions. We estimate that ${\\sim}$2/3 of the PAH emission in typical local star-forming galaxies is excited by older stars and unrelated to recent ($<$10 Myr) star formation.",

H-ATLAS J084933.4+021443, a z = 2.41 binary HyLIRG (galaxies W and T) with two additional luminous companions (C and M), offers an ideal laboratory for studying star formation during \"cosmic noon\". We use ALMA to obtain resolved imaging and kinematics of CO J:7-6, [C I] 2-1, H2O, and rest-frame 340-1160 GHz continuum emission in all four galaxies. Each system is spatially resolved within ~0.3 arcsec (2.5 kpc) apertures. Gas kinematics in W and T are rotation-dominated, with galaxy T showing emission extended along its kinematic minor axis due to lensing magnification. Spatially resolved SEDs indicate that W is well fitted by single-temperature greybody dust despite hosting a luminous AGN, while T requires an additional hot-dust component and extra millimetre emission. We confirm [C I] J:2-1 as a tracer of warm/dense molecular gas in these extreme systems, though its luminosity ratio with CO J:7-6 rises sub-linearly. We derive resolved (2.5 kpc-scale) Schmidt-Kennicutt (SK) relations for W and T using both cold and warm/dense gas, finding depletion times of about 50-100 Myr (W) and about 100-500 Myr (T). Both galaxies follow a steep SK relation with power-law index n ~ 1.7, significantly above the n ~ 1 observed in normal star-forming galaxies.",

To reconstruct the orbital evolution of the known globular clusters of the dwarf galaxy Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage, we used the parallel $N$-body code $\\varphi$-GPU. We investigated the relationship between globular clusters and their progenitor by analysing their orbital parameters and phase-space distribution during 9 Gyr of evolution in the past. We created a $N$-body model of Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage globular clusters and analysed their dynamical evolution and distribution of the escaped stars today. We summarised the samples of the Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage globular clusters and created two main categories: `most probable' and `tentative', with 15 and 9 clusters, respectively. We analysed the evolution of their kinematic, orbital, and phase-space parameters in the external time-variable potential. We defined phase-space distribution limits of stars that escape from globular clusters during 9 Gyr of evolution: a specific energy from -18 to -12.2 $\\times10^4$ km$^2$ s$^{-2}$, L$_{\\rm z}$ from -0.98 to 0.72 $\\times10^3$ kpc km s$^{-1}$, and L$_{\\rm perp}$ from 0 to 1.8 $\\times10^3$ kpc km s$^{-1}$. The limits of the GE/S debris in Galactic area based on orbital parameters of the GC's escaped stars are: for apocentre and pericetre distances of 10--28 and 1--4 kpc, < 18 kpc in Galactocentric radius and < |15| kpc in the Z direction. Generally we compared the phase-space distribution of escaped stars from the GCs GE/S debris energy-angular momentum limits with the observed very metal-poor stars, which belong to the GE/S itself and produce consistent results.",

We identify ISM cloud structures in PHANGS-JWST 7.7 $\\mu$m PAH maps for 66 galaxies, smoothed to 30 pc and at native resolution, extracting 108,466 and 146,040 clouds, respectively. Molecular properties were inferred using a linear conversion from PAH to CO. Given the tendency for clouds in galaxy centers to overlap in velocity space, we opted to flag these and omit them from the analysis in this work. The remaining clouds correspond to giant molecular clouds, such as those detected in CO(2-1) emission by ALMA, or lower surface density clouds that either fall below the ALMA detection limits of existing maps or genuinely have no molecular counterpart. Cross-matching with ALMA CO maps at 90 pc in 27 galaxies shows that 41 % of PAH clouds have CO associations. The converted molecular properties vary little across environments, but the most massive clouds are preferentially found in spiral arms. Fitting lognormal mass distributions down to $2\\times10^{3} M_{\\odot}$ shows that spiral arms host the highest-mass clouds, consistent with enhanced formation in arm gravitational potentials. Cloud molecular surface densities decline by a factor of $\\sim 1.5-2$ toward $2 - 3 R_{e}$. However, the trend largely varies in individual galaxies, with flat, decreasing, and even no trend as a function of galactocentric radius. Factors like large-scale processes and morphologies might influence the observed trends. We publish two catalogs online, one at the common resolution of 30 pc and another at the native resolution. We expect them to have broad utility for future PAH clouds, molecular clouds, and star formation studies.",

Data available at this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Star-forming galaxies form tight relations between their stellar mass, star-formation rate, and molecular gas reservoir on global and resolved scales. On the path to quiescence, the exchange between gas and stars must inevitably be broken. Understanding the mechanisms governing star formation and quenching therefore requires observations of both the stellar and molecular gas components. To this end, we have assembled a sample of 277 galaxies ($0.02 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 0.25$) with semi-resolved optical and millimetre $^{12}$CO(1-0) data, wherein the properties of the inner $\\thicksim$2 kpc can be distinguished from the outer regions. This effort was made possible by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) catalogues and the maturing archive of the Atacama Large (sub-)Millimetre Array (ALMA). We call this dataset the SDSS-ALMA Legacy Value Archival Gas Exploration (SALVAGE). In this work, we leverage SALVAGE to provide a semi-resolved perspective on global scaling relations and why some galaxies deviate from them. In agreement with previous work, we find that the offset of a galaxy from the global star-forming main sequence (SFMS) is driven by its inner star formation rate. With the relative inner and outer distributions of molecular gas fraction and star formation efficiency, we investigate whether the central star formation driving global changes is due to fuel availability or efficiency. We find that the position of a galaxy within the SFMS is largely due to the inner star-formation efficiency, while departure from the SFMS is driven by availability of central gas. The central few kpc are thus the most consequential region for galaxy evolution at low redshift.",

The surviving dwarf galaxies orbiting the MW serve as exceptional laboratories for studying the unique properties of these systems. Their metal-poor environments and shallow gravitational potentials likely drive significant differences in star formation and star cluster properties compared to those in the MW. Using high-quality near-infrared spectra from the APOGEE survey, we determined abundances of Fe, C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, and Ce for 74 stars in four MW satellite dwarf galaxies: Fornax, Sextans, Draco, and Carina. Our analysis reveals that the distribution of $\\alpha$ elements (e.g., [Si/Fe]) strongly correlates with galaxy luminosity (and hence mass), underscoring the critical role of galaxy mass in shaping chemical evolution. These dwarf galaxies exhibit [Al/Fe$]\\sim -0.5$, which is comparable to those of the metal-poor stars in the MW. Additionally, we identified nitrogen-rich field stars in the Fornax dwarf galaxy, which display distinct metallicities compared to its known globular clusters (GCs). If these stars originated in GCs and subsequently escaped, their presence suggests we are observing relics of destroyed GCs, offering possible evidence of cluster disruption.",

Accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Satellite galaxies that are near to massive primary galaxies in close pairs can have stellar population ages that are more similar to their primaries than expected. This is one way in which close pairs of galaxies show galactic conformity, which is thought to be driven by assembly bias. Such conformity is seen in ages, morphologies and star formation rates in different samples. This paper revisits a high signal-to-noise SDSS spectroscopic sample, by spectral fitting of new stellar population models, to investigate satellite galaxy properties of age, metallicity and alpha-element abundance. We find the clear signature of age conformity, as previously seen, but no clear evidence for conformity in metallicity or abundance ratios. The offsets showing age conformity are not caused by age-metallicity degeneracies. There is a suggestion in these data that lower velocity dispersion satellites have increased [alpha/Fe] compared to a control sample of passive galaxies, however this needs further observations to be verified. Our results also suggest an intriguing turnover in the age trends of the satellites at the highest velocity dispersion, perhaps reflecting the onset of environment-related processes in the most massive groups.",

Astrochemistry expanded further in order to explain the role of atomic and molecular processes in a broad range of phenomena in the universe. It is instructive to describe the current scope of astrochemistry using the career and accomplishments of Alexander Dalgarno as an organizing principle. Dalgarno helped to establish a self-sustaining community of astrochemists around the world. His own research interests highlight the early development of astrochemistry and anticipate much of its later evolution. His theoretical investigations of fundamental atomic and molecular processes lie at the heart of the subject.",

This package can generate one-dimensional spectra corresponding to local physical properties at specific positions according to a series of two-dimensional distributions of physical parameters of target sources. In this way, it can produce a spatially resolved spectral cube of the target source. Two-dimensional distributions of physical parameters, including surface brightness, stellar population, and line-of-sight velocity, can be modeled using the parametric model or based on real observational data and numerical simulation data. For the generation of one-dimensional spectra, we have considered four types of spectra, including the stellar continuum spectra, ionized gas emission lines, AGN spectra, and stellar spectra. That makes GEHONG able to mock various types of targets, including galaxies, AGNs, star clusters, and HII regions.",

With its large field of view ($7.5^{\\prime}\\times7.5^{\\prime}$), MCI is particularly well-suited for observing galaxy clusters, providing a powerful tool for investigating galaxy evolution, dark matter and dark energy through gravitational lensing. Here we present a comprehensive simulation framework of a strong lensing cluster as observed by MCI, aiming to fully exploit its capabilities in capturing lensing features. The framework simulates a strong lensing cluster from the CosmoDC2 catalog, calculating the gravitational potential and performing ray-tracing to derive the true positions, shapes and light distribution of galaxies within the cluster field. Additionally, the simulation incorporates intra-cluster light (ICL) and spectral energy distributions (SEDs), enabling further strong lensing analyses, such as ICL seperation from galaxy light and mass reconstruction combining strong and weak lensing measurements. This framework provides a critical benchmark for testing the MCI data pipeline and maximizing its potential in galaxy cluster research.",

Hickson, Jean-Christophe Loison, Benjamin Benne, Michel Dobrijevic Accepted for publication in Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The chemistry of planetary atmospheres containing molecular nitrogen as a major atmospheric component is strongly influenced by the reactions of atomic nitrogen. Although nitrogen atoms in their ground electronic state N(4S) are mostly unreactive towards stable molecules, electronically excited nitrogen atoms N(2D) are much more reactive and could play an important role in the formation of nitriles and other nitrogen bearing organic molecules in planetary atmospheres such as Titan. Despite this, few kinetic studies of N(2D) reactions have been performed over the appropriate low temperature range. Here, we report the results of an experimental study of the reactions N(2D) + methylacetylene, CH3CCH, and N(2D) + acetonitrile, CH3CN, using a supersonic flow reactor at selected temperatures between 50 K and 296 K. N(2D) atoms, which were generated indirectly as a product of the C(3P) + NO reaction, were subsequently detected by laser induced fluorescence in the vacuum ultraviolet wavelength region. The measured rate constants are significantly larger than the estimated values in current photochemical models and do not display large variations as a function of temperature. The new rate constants are included in a 1D coupled ion-neutral model of Titans atmosphere to test their influence on the simulated species abundances. In addition, the overall description of both reactions is improved by considering the results of recent experimental and theoretical work examining the product channels of these processes. These simulations indicate that while the N(2D) + CH3CCH reaction has only a limited overall influence on Titans atmospheric chemistry, the N(2D) + CH3CN reaction could lead to the formation of significant relative abundances of cyanomethamine, HNCHCN, in the upper atmosphere.",

Moriya 19 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) SBS~0335-052E is a young star-forming dwarf galaxy with a total stellar mass of $M_{*} \\lesssim 10^{8}~M_{\\odot}$ and an extremely low metallicity ($Z \\sim 1/40~Z_{\\odot}$), which has long been considered to be devoid of an active galactic nucleus (AGN).

Our spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of archival ultraviolet (UV)-NIR photometry, including AGN SED models, indicates that the variable NIR emission arises from an edge-on AGN dust torus. The UV-optical emission from the accretion disk is obscured and does not reach us, leading to the dominance of the host galaxy's young stellar population in the UV-optical wavelengths. This analysis favors the presence of a Compton-thick, heavily obscured AGN in SBS~0335-052E, consistent with its observed X-ray weakness. From the SED fitting, we estimate an AGN bolometric luminosity of $L_{\\rm bol} = 1.2\\times10^{43}\\ {\\rm erg\\ s^{-1}}$, which implies a black hole mass of $M_{\\rm BH} \\simeq 10^{5}\\ M_\\odot$ if the AGN is accreting at the Eddington limit. If confirmed, SBS~0335-052E would be the least massive galaxy known to host an AGN, likely harboring an intermediate-mass black hole.",

Wang et al 2025 ApJ 993 199 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We use the ASTRID cosmological simulation to forecast massive black hole (MBH) mergers detectable by Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) down to $z=0$. ASTRID directly models MBH dynamical friction, allowing a realistic tracking of their trajectory. It also incorporates relatively low-mass MBH seeds down to $5\\times10^{4} M_{\\odot}$, providing a more complete picture of LISA MBH mergers. We find that LISA MBH mergers initially have high eccentricities, peaking around $e_0 = 0.8$ across all redshifts. Accounting for this boosts the event rate from 5.6 yr$^{-1}$ (if circular orbits are assumed) to 10.5 yr$^{-1}$. This enhancement is largely due to additional inspiral sources that will coalesce after LISA's observation, which constitute $46\\%$ of detected this http URL underscores the importance of LISA's sensitivity to the early inspiral phase, especially for eccentric binaries that emit gravitational waves across a wider frequency band. Most LISA events in ASTRID arise from $M_{\\mathrm{BH}}\\sim10^{5-6}\\ M_\\odot$, low-redshift ($z<2$) and low mass-ratio ($q\\sim0.01$-$0.1$) mergers. Accounting for eccentricity broadens the detectable MBH mass range up to $10^{9} M_\\odot$ and shifts the peak of detectable mergers to a lower redshift $z_{\\rm peak}=0.8$. This implies that the most massive LISA events may also be PTA sources. We predict LISA events to be in various galaxy environments, including many low-mass satellite galaxies. The electromagnetic (EM) counterparts of most LISA sources have active galactic nuclei (AGN) luminosities $L_{\\rm bol}>10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, albeit only $1\\%$ with $>10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The brightest AGN are those associated with the rare LISA/PTA events with $M_{\\rm BH}>10^{8} M_\\odot$.",

Published in ApJS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Stellar counterrotating (CR) galaxies are systems hosting two large-scale stellar components rotating in opposite directions -- a main, preexisting galaxy body with an older stellar population and a younger CR stellar disk likely formed from externally accreted gas. Such systems offer a unique opportunity to study disk assembly by analyzing the stellar populations of each component. Using integral field spectroscopic data from the SDSS-IV Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey, we identified a sample of 120 CR disk galaxies (65 reliable and 55 probable systems) by inspecting their kinematic maps and analyzing the shape of the stellar line-of-sight velocity distribution, which was recovered nonparametrically. Of these, 74 CR galaxies have not been reported in previous studies. For one-third of our sample, we further derived the ages and metallicities of stars for both disks via a spectral decomposition technique. We show that the observed spatial bimodality -- where the CR disk either is concentrated in the central region (inner counterrotation) or dominates the outer part of the galaxy (outer counterrotation) -- is driven by differences in the stellar mass and angular momentum of the CR disk. The wide range of stellar metallicities observed in CR disks suggests that no single source of external material is solely responsible for the formation of counterrotation in all galaxies; instead, proposed mechanisms such as merger with gas-rich satellites, accretion from cosmic filaments, and exchange of gas between neighboring galaxies can dominate in individual cases.",

Building upon our previous initial measurements of stellar light from two quasar host galaxies at these redshifts, we now report the detection of the stellar light from the full Cycle 1 sample of 12 distant moderate-luminosity quasar (M1450>-24 mag) host galaxies at z>6 from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). Using JWST/NIRCam observations at 1.5 and 3.6 um combined with 2D image decomposition analysis, we successfully detect the host galaxies in 11 of the 12 targets, underscoring the high detection rates achievable with moderate-luminosity quasars. Based on two-band photometry and SED fitting, we find that our host galaxies are massive, with logM*/M_sun = 9.5-11.0. The effective radii range from 0.6 to 3.2 kpc, comparable to the sizes of inactive galaxies with similar masses at z~6 as measured with imaging from this http URL, the two quasar hosts with post-starburst features, which reside at the high-mass end of our sample and exhibit relatively compact morphologies, have similar size and stellar mass surface densities to quiescent galaxies at z~4-5. These findings suggest that the so-called galaxy compaction scenario is already in place at the reionization epoch, in which gas inflows during starburst phases drive centrally concentrated star formation followed by rapid quenching, bridging the structural transition of massive galaxies from relatively extended star-forming disks to compact quiescent systems.",

Kacprzak, Jonathan Stern 37 pages with 11 figures; accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Quasar sightline observations reveal that low-ionization-state gas corotates with the galaxy disk and often at sub-centrifugal velocities, suggesting that the gas is spiraling towards the galaxy disk. However, while observations ubiquitously detect O VI absorption around low-redshift, $\\sim L^*$ star-forming galaxies, the relationship between O VI and the galaxy disk, especially the kinematics, is not well-established. This work focuses on the O VI kinematics and its comparison with that of the low ions and galactic disk rotation. We present observations of 18 pairs of quasars and $z\\approx0.2$ star-forming galaxies. All quasar sightlines intersect the circumgalactic medium (CGM) within 45$^\\circ$ from the galaxy major axes. We show that while individual O VI velocity components do not correlate with disk rotation, the bulk of O VI gas in individual sightlines rarely counter-rotates. We then match O VI velocity components with those of low ions by minimizing the difference of their velocity centroids. The O VI velocity components with successful low-ion matches are typically found at small sightline impact parameters and are more likely to corotate with the disk. We suggest that the low-ion-matched O VI velocity components trace the gas co-spatial with the low ions near the extended disk plane in the inner CGM, whereas those without low-ion matches represent the gas at large 3D radii. While the gas at large radii is theoretically expected to kinematically correlate with the disk angular momentum, this correlation is expected to be weaker due to the higher turbulent to mean rotation velocity ration at large radii, consistent with our results.",

By comparing their colors to young stellar source (YSS) colors generated by stochastically simulated star formation (SF) for various SFRs and SFHs, we ruled out their origin as a UV-upturn population and identified them as YSS. We found an extremely low SFR of $\\sim 2\\times10^{-5}$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ in M87, with evidence of a weak starburst $\\sim$125 Myr ago that formed $\\sim 1000$ M$_\\odot$ of stars. Unlike other cool-core clusters where SF is stronger and directly linked to cooling gas, we found no spatial correlation between YSS and H$\\alpha$ filaments. Comparing SF activity with M87's AGN outburst history suggests that recent AGN feedback events ($\\lesssim$12 Myr ago) neither triggered nor were associated with any detectable SF, however, earlier outbursts may have triggered weak starbursts. We detected UV filaments co-spatial with H$\\alpha$ filaments with similar lengths and widths, though they are obscured by dust near the center. These filaments are likely powered by metal-line emission from collisional ionization, suggesting ongoing low-level precipitation of the intracluster medium. Our results indicate that AGN feedback has quenched SF significantly in M87 for at least 200 Myr, even though some precipitation persists. Additionally, we identified a hotspot created by the counterjet, with the spectral index also constrained.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Understanding the morphological structures of Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) is crucial for unveiling their formation pathways and the physical origins of Ly$\\alpha$ emission. However, the evolution of their sizes and structural scaling relations remains debated. In this study, we analyze a large sample of 876 spectroscopically confirmed LAEs at $3 \\lesssim z < 7$, selected from the MUSE, VANDELS, and CANDELSz7 surveys in the GOODS-S, UDS, and COSMOS fields. Utilizing James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam imaging data, we measure their rest-frame UV and optical V-band effective radii ($R_{\\rm e}$) through two-dimensional Sérsic profile fitting. Our results show that these LAEs are generally compact, with a median $R_{\\rm e,UV}$ of 0.50$^{+0.30}_{-0.24}$ kpc and a median $R_{\\rm e,V}$ of 0.57$^{+0.33}_{-0.24}$ kpc. The size evolution follows $R_{\\rm e,UV} \\propto (1 + z)^{-0.91 \\pm 0.10}$ and $R_{\\rm e,V} \\propto (1 + z)^{-0.93 \\pm 0.18}$, respectively. Their UV and optical sizes are statistically comparable, indicating negligible UV-to-optical color gradients. For the first time, we establish the rest-frame optical size-mass relation for LAEs at $z>3$, finding slopes comparable to typical star-forming galaxies (SFGs), but with slightly smaller sizes at a given stellar mass. These results provide important clues for understanding structural evolution of LAEs in the early universe.",

They are found neighbouring two out of four known giant LANs at $z\\sim3$ in our MUSE follow-up observations, reinforcing the idea that Ly$\\alpha$ emission can be used to trace massive dark matter halos at high-$z$. This high occurrence of massive satellite halos agrees with simulations. With sizes of $\\simeq80\\times160$ and $80\\times100~\\mathrm{pkpc}^2$, the two nebulae are both $\\sim$300pkpc from the main LANs. The Ly$\\alpha$ emission is only shifted by $\\simeq100-300$ km s$^{-1}$ between each of the two pairs, suggesting connections via large-scale structure. RO-1001-Sat and RO-0959-Sat are estimated to have log$(M_\\mathrm{h}/M_\\odot)\\simeq13.2\\pm0.3$ and $12.8\\pm0.3$, putting them potentially close to the regime of cold-mode accretion. The central brightest galaxies in the two halos are morphologically distinct despite having similar stellar mass $\\sim10^{11}M_\\odot$, one being an elliptical quiescent galaxy in RO-1001-Sat and the other being a dusty star-forming spiral in RO-0959-Sat. Intriguingly, the quiescent galaxy aligns well with the peak of the LAN as well as the potential well of the host halo, making it the first clear-cut case where the cold gas ought to be accreting onto the galaxy but with no observable star formation, either due to morphological quenching or, more likely, radio-mode feedback from an active galactic nucleus. Finally, we show a tentative detection of a Ly$\\alpha$ filament connecting RO-1001 and RO-1001-Sat. This work shows how panoramic MUSE (and in the future, BlueMUSE) observations of massive halo seeds can be used to efficiently search for additional halos, unveiling their large-scale structure and enabling the study of Ly$\\alpha$-selected galaxy groups.",

Bulges, located at the central regions of galaxies, are complex structures, expected to be shaped by the physical processes involved in the assembly history of their host galaxy, such as gravitational collapse, mergers, interactions, and bars. As a consequence a variety of bulges with distinct morphology and chemistry could be produced. Aim. We aim at exploring the existence of a stellar mass-metallicity relation of bulges, MZ*R, and analyze the possible imprint of characteristics features by accretion and migration of stars, which could store information on their assembly histories. Methods. We use 44 central galaxies from the CIELO cosmological simulations. Their stellar masses are within the range of [10^7.6, 10^10.6] Msun. We decomposed the galaxy into bulge and disk using the circularity and binding energies. We track the stellar populations in bulges back in time to their birth location, classifying them as bulge-born in-situ, and disk-born stars and accreted. Results. We find that most of the stars in our bulges are formed in-situ, but 33% of our bulges show a non-negligible contribution of stellar accretion from satellites, which could add to about 35% of the population. The accreted material is generally contribute by two or three satellites at most. In some bulges, we also find up to a 32% of stars that migrated from the disk due to secular evolution, with a median of 10%. Regardless of the formation histories, we found a clear MZ*R for bulges, which is more enriched by about 0.4 dex than the corresponding relation of the disk components, and about 0.15 dex more enriched than the galaxy MZ*R. We find evidence that the dispersion in the bulge MZ*R is influenced by both stellar accretion from satellites and migration from the disk, such that, at a fixed bulge mass, bulges with higher fraction of accreted and migrated stars tend to be less metal-rich (abridged).",

The catalogs are built by coupling the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) semi-analytical model of galaxy formation with merger trees extracted from the simulations using the Hierarchical Bound-Tracing (HBT+) algorithm. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and broadband magnitudes are computed using the neural-network-based stellar population synthesizer StarDuster, which is trained on radiative transfer simulations to account for detailed galaxy geometry in modeling dust obscuration. Galaxy light-cones up to $z=5$ are subsequently generated with the BLiC light-cone builder which interpolates the properties of galaxies over time using an optimized interpolation scheme. The resulting catalogs exhibit good convergence in many statistical properties of the galaxy population produced from two different resolution simulations. The catalogs reproduce a number of observed galaxy properties across a range of galaxy mass and redshift, including the stellar mass functions, the luminosity function, gas mass fraction, galaxy size-mass relation and galaxy clustering. We also present the photometric and redshift distributions of galaxies expected to be observed in the CSST surveys.",

Botelho Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Inertial modes have been recently detected in the Sun via helioseismology, yet their origin, evolution, and role in the dynamics of the solar plasma and magnetic field remain poorly understood. In this study, we employ global numerical simulations to investigate the excitation mechanisms and dynamical consequences of inertial modes in the Sun and stellar interiors. We validate first our numerical setup by analyzing the evolution of sectoral and tesseral perturbations imposed on a rigidly rotating sphere. The results confirm that a perturbation of a given mode can excite neighboring modes with both smaller and larger wavenumbers along the dispersion relation of Rossby waves. Subsequently, we use a physically motivated forcing to impose differential rotation with varying shear amplitudes, and examine the spontaneous onset and nonlinear evolution of inertial modes. The simulations reveal that the growth of velocity perturbations is primarily driven by baroclinic instability. It gives rise to high-latitude inertial modes in the form of retrograde polar vortices whose properties depend on the imposed shear. Equatorial Rossby modes are also excited, albeit with lower intensity than their high-latitude counterpart. Perturbations with arbitrary azimuthal wavenumbers lead to the excitation of Rossby modes for all available wave numbers, sustained by both direct and inverse energy cascades. In simulations with stronger shear, the high latitude modes produce Reynolds stresses able to modify the imposed differential rotation and accelerate the rotation of the poles.",

Pereira 20 pages, 13 figures and 4 tabls. Accepted in the ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Although triple systems are common, their orbital dynamics and stellar evolution remain poorly understood. We investigated the V1371 Tau system using TESS photometry, multi-epoch spectroscopy, and recent interferometric data, confirming it as a rare triple system consisting of an eclipsing binary orbited by a classical Be star, with a spectral classification of (B1V + B0V) + B0Ve. The eclipsing binary exhibits an orbital period of approximately 34 days, and the Be star orbits the inner pair on a timescale of a few years. Weak H$\\alpha$ emission lines suggest the presence of a Keplerian disk with variability on a timescale of months around the Be star, and a nearly constant V/R ratio with no detectable asymmetry variations. Besides the eclipses, frequencies at 0.24 and 0.26 c/d dominate the photometric variability. Higher-frequency signals are present which appear associated with non-radial pulsation. The eclipsing pair ($i \\approx 90^\\circ$) shows projected rotational velocities of 160 and 200 km s$^{-1}$. The Be star's measured $v \\sin i \\approx 250$ km s$^{-1}$ implies a critical rotation fraction between 0.44 and 0.76 for plausible inclinations, significantly faster than the eclipsing components. The shallower eclipses in the KELT data compared to TESS suggest a variation in orbital inclination, possibly induced by Kozai-Lidov cycles from the outer Be star. The evolution analysis suggests that all components are massive main-sequence stars, with the secondary star in the eclipsing binary being overluminous. This study emphasizes the complexity of triple systems with Be stars and provides a basis for future research on their formation, evolution, and dynamics.",

      "abstract": "Asteroseismology and Buoyancy Glitch Inversion with Fourier Spectra of Gravity Mode Period Spacings Zhao Guo Astronomy & Astrophysics, accepted Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We investigate the small, quasi-periodic modulations seen in the gravity-mode period spacings of pulsating stars. These ``wiggles'' are produced by buoyancy glitches -- sharp features in the buoyancy frequency ($N$) caused by composition transitions and the convective--radiative interface. Our method takes the Fourier transform of the period-spacing series, $FT(\\Delta P_k)$ as a function of radial order $k$. We show that $FT(\\Delta P_k)$ traces the radial derivative of the normalized glitch profile $\\delta N/N$ with respect to the normalized buoyancy radius; peaks in $FT(\\Delta P_k)$ therefore pinpoint jump/drop locations in $N$ and measure their sharpness. We also note that the Fourier transform of relative period perturbations (deviations from asymptotic values), $FT(\\delta P/P)$, directly recovers the absolute value of the glitch profile $|\\delta N/N|$, enabling a straightforward inversion for the internal structure. The dominant $FT(\\Delta P_k)$ frequency correlates tightly with central hydrogen abundance ($X_c$) and thus with stellar age for slowly pulsating B-stars, with only weak mass dependence. Applying the technique to MESA stellar models and to observed slowly pulsating B-stars and $\\gamma$ Dor pulsators, we find typical glitch amplitudes $\\delta N/N \\lesssim 0.01$ and derivative magnitudes $\\lesssim 0.1$, concentrated at chemical gradients and the convective boundary. This approach enables fast, ensemble asteroseismology of g-mode pulsators, constrains internal mixing and ages, and can be extended to other classes of pulsators, with potential links to tidal interactions in binaries.",

While most chemical abundance studies of Cepheids rely on optical spectroscopy, near-infrared (NIR) observations offer advantages in terms of reduced extinction and access to new elemental tracers. Aims. We aim to validate NIR-based abundance determinations against optical results and to explore the diagnostic power of spectral lines inaccessible in the optical domain. The H and K bands allow us to trace elements such as P, K, and Yb, while also probing obscured Galactic regions and more distant Cepheids. Methods. We obtained high-resolution (R=45000) H- and K-band spectra for 21 Galactic and 2 LMC Classical Cepheids using IGRINS. Atmospheric parameters were derived from photometry and line-depth ratios (Teff), empirical calibrations (log g), and spectral fitting. Abundances of 16 elements were determined via LTE full spectral synthesis and compared with optical literature values. Results. We find excellent agreement between NIR and optical abundances, confirming the reliability of IGRINS-based measurements. The Fe, Mg, and Si gradients match previous optical determinations. We provide the first homogeneous NIR-based measurements of P, K, and Yb in Cepheids, consistent with chemical evolution models. The two LMC Cepheids in our sample, also studied optically, serve as extragalactic benchmarks for validating NIR abundances in low-metallicity regimes. Conclusions. High-resolution NIR spectroscopy yields accurate chemical abundances in Cepheids, consistent with optical results, and grants access to additional nucleosynthetic tracers. These results support future large NIR spectroscopic surveys with instruments such as MOONS, ELT, and JWST for Galactic and extragalactic archaeology.",

Dobrotka (Advanced Technologies Research Institute, Slovakia), M. Orio (INAF, Italy, UW, USA) Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We analyzed TESS archival data of three novae after recent outbursts, searching the orbital and white dwarf (WD) rotation period and possible variations of these periods. In V1405 Cas, we detected a period of $\\sim$116.88 seconds, which we identified as due to the WD spin, and measured a rate of increase of 0.001542$\\pm0.000009\\, {\\rm s\\, d}^{-1}$, one the fastest spin-down rates ever recorded. The rapid spin-down coupled with an X-ray luminosity several orders of magnitude lower than the available spin-down power, strongly indicates that the system is in a magnetic ``propeller'' state, namely the rotational energy powers the system's X-ray luminosity. We measured a previously unknown orbital period of 1.36 days for V1716 Sco. If the X-ray flux modulation with a period of 77.9 s detected in outburst for this nova is due to the rotation of an strongly magnetized white dwarf as in other novae with similar modulations of the supersoft X-ray source in outburst, the system is in a parameter space that challenges standard models of cataclysmic variable evolution. For V1674 Her, which has already been classified as an intermediate polar (IP), we confirm the known spin period of 501.33$\\pm$0.01 s and the orbital period of 0.1529$\\pm$0.0001 days, suggesting that the spin modulation was also the root cause of the periodicity in X-rays in outburst, and that the WD atmosphere in the supersoft X-ray phase was not thermally homogeneous. Our results highlight the power of high-cadence, continuous observations in revealing extreme and unexpected characteristics of accreting white dwarfs.",

Its unusual atmospheric composition and kinematics indicate a white dwarf merger origin. We present time-series photometry of J0551+4135 obtained using the Apache Point Observatory 3.5m, Gemini North 8m, and Gran Telescopio Canarias 10m telescopes. J0551+4135 exhibits variations in pulsation amplitude and frequency over time. We detect ten significant recurring peaks across different subsets of observations, with frequencies ranging from 987 to 1180~$\\mu$Hz, consistent with non-radial gravity ($g$)-mode oscillations. We present new evolutionary models suitable for spectroscopic characterization of DAQ white dwarfs, and derive a mass of $1.13 \\pm 0.01\\,M_\\odot$ and a cooling age of $1.7 \\pm 0.1$ Gyr for a CO core, and $1.12 \\pm 0.01\\,M_\\odot$ and $1.6 \\pm 0.1$\\,Gyr for an ONe-core white dwarf, respectively. However, detailed asteroseismology of this unique pulsator has to wait until fully-consistent DAQ evolutionary models are available.

It is crucial to investigate the evolution of CMEs and their deformation for understanding the interaction between the solar wind and CMEs. We quantify the effect of the dynamic solar wind on the propagation of a CME in the heliosphere with a hydrodynamic plasma cloud-cone model and a linear force-free spheromak model at various locations in the heliosphere. We chose a CME event that launched on SOL2021-09-23T04:39:45 and was observed by multiple spacecraft, namely BepiColombo, Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, Stereo A and ACE. The solar wind was modelled in the steady and dynamic regimes in the Icarus model. The CME parameters were approximated for the selected event, and two CME models (spheromak and cone) were launched from the inner heliosphere boundary. The obtained synthetic in situ measurements were compared to the observed in situ measurements at all spacecraft. The internal magnetic field of the flux rope was better reconstructed by the spheromak model than by the cone CME model. The cone CME model maintained a nearly constant longitudinal angular extension while somewhat contracting in the radial direction. In contrast, the spheromak model contracted in the longitudinal direction while expanding in the radial direction. The CME sheath and magnetic cloud signatures were better reproduced at the four spacecraft clustered around the CME nose by the spheromak CME model. The dynamic solar wind caused a greater deceleration of the modelled CME than the steady-state solar wind solution. Because the background was homogeneous, the modelled CME properties were only mildly affected by the solar wind regime, however.",

Due to the strong brightness of the Sun and the lack of white light observations of the solar atmosphere and low corona (1-1.5R$_\\odot$), total solar eclipses have become a standard approach for validating the coronal models. In this study, we validate the COCONUT coronal model by predicting the coronal configuration during the total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024. We aim to predict the accurate configuration of the solar corona during the total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024. We utilise the full 3D MHD model to reconstruct the solar corona from the solar surface to $30\\;R_\\odot$. The upcoming total solar eclipse predictions were conducted in three different regimes: quasi-steady driving of the inner boundary conditions (BCs) with a daily cadence and dynamic driving of the inner BCs with both daily and hourly cadences. The results from all the simulations are compared to the total solar eclipse images. Additionally, the synthetic white-light (WL) images are generated from the STEREO-A field of view and compared to COR2 observed images. Normalised polarised brightness is compared in the COR2 and synthetic WL images. The predicted solar corona does not vary significantly in the first half of the prediction window. The dynamic simulations yielded better results than the quasi-steady predictions. The west limb was reconstructed better in the simulations than the east limb. We have predicted the total solar eclipse coronal configuration 18 days before the total solar eclipse. We can conclude that the dynamic simulations produced more accurate predictions. The availability of comprehensive observations is crucial, as the emergence of the active region on the east limb made it difficult to accurately predict the east limb coronal configuration due to incorrect input of magnetic field data.",

This paper introduces LRPayne, a novel algorithm designed for the efficient determination of stellar parameters and chemical abundances from low-resolution optical spectra, with a primary focus on data from large-scale galactic surveys such as WEAVE. Methods. LRPayne employs a model-driven approach, utilising a fully connected artificial neural network (ANN), trained on a library of 70,000 synthetic stellar spectra generated using iSpec with 1D MARCS model atmospheres and the Turbospectrum synthesis code. The network is trained to predict normalized flux given stellar labels (Teff, log(g), [Fe/H], vmic, vmax and v sin i, and 24 individual elemental abundances). Stellar parameters are subsequently derived from observed spectra by finding the best-fit synthetic spectrum from the ANN using a chi-squared minimisation technique. The method operates on spectra degraded to a resolution of R=5000 covering the wavelength range 4200-6900 Å. Results. Internal accuracy tests on synthetic spectra show a median interpolation error of less than 0.13 % for 90 % of the validation sample. The method accurately recovers most input labels from synthetic spectra, even at a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 20, with some expected challenges for elements like Li, K, and N. Validation on observed spectra of 25 Gaia FGK benchmark stars and 42 metal-poor stars reveals good agreement with literature values. For stellar parameters, mean differences are 22+-87 K for Teff , 0.19+-0.23 dex for log(g), and 0.01+-0.17 dex for [Fe/H]. Abundances for elements like Na, Mg, Si, and most Fe-peak elements (Cr, Ni, V, Sc) are well-recovered. Challenges are noted for oxygen, manganese in metal-rich giants, aluminium in metal-poor stars and dwarfs, and for deriving log g in hot metal-poor dwarfs, partly due to non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects and line characteristics.",

Samara, S. Majumdar, R. Chhetri, N.D.R. Bhat, M. Johnston-Hollitt 23 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables. Accepted into AGU Space Weather Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We have conducted a comprehensive comparison of interplanetary scintillation (IPS) observations taken by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) with several heliospheric transient event catalogues, over a time period of 7 months during solar minimum. From this analysis we have found that of the 84% of catalogued events that have MWA IPS data available, 68% of them appear in MWA observations. Of the enhancements first identified in IPS observations, only 58% have a potential match with a catalogued event. The majority of enhancements that were identified in the IPS observations were situated greater than 10$^\\circ$ from the ecliptic plane. Two such features were selected for detailed analysis, connecting their solar origins to their propagation through the heliosphere. The first of these features was created by a coronal mass ejection (CME), captured over two successive MWA observations and recorded in several catalogues. The second feature has the potential of being a stream interaction region (SIR) travelling out of the ecliptic plane. This particular SIR was not recorded in any catalogue. Thus the MWA shows promise in detecting heliospheric transients that other commonly-used techniques may overlook. These results show the strength of the MWA in having unbridled access to the heliosphere, able to make remote observations of events far out of the ecliptic as it is not restrained to the orbits of spacecraft. We demonstrate how the inclusion of MWA IPS data can potentially boost the number of CME and SIR events that are characterised.",

Saleem Khan Accepted for the publication in ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Decades-long studies of asymmetric spectral lines in the solar corona suggest mass and energy transport from lower atmospheric layers to the corona. While slow magnetoacoustic waves and plasma flows are recognized as drivers of these spectral line asymmetries, the role of transverse MHD waves remains largely unexplored. Previous simulations have shown that unidirectionally propagating kink waves, in the presence of perpendicular density inhomogeneities, can produce a turbulence-like phenomenon called ``uniturbulence''. However, the spectroscopic signatures of this effect have not been investigated until now. Due to varying Doppler shifts from the plasma elements with different emissions, we expect to observe signatures of both blueward and redward asymmetries. Past instruments like EIS may have missed these signatures due to resolution limitations, but current instruments like DKIST offer a better opportunity for detection. We conducted 3D MHD simulations of transverse waves in a polar plume with density inhomogeneities and performed forward modeling for the Fe XIII emission line at 10749 Å. Our findings show that transverse waves and uniturbulence induce alternating red and blueward asymmetries, with magnitudes reaching up to 20\\% of peak intensity and secondary peak velocities between 30 and 40 km s$^{-1}$, remaining under 100 km s$^{-1}$. These asymmetries propagate with the transverse waves, and even at DKIST resolution, similar signatures can be detected. Our study suggests that spectral line asymmetries can serve as a diagnostic tool for detecting transverse wave-induced uniturbulence.",

Pintr Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Flares and CMEs are known to be the dominating high-energy phenomena on cool stars. Superflares were thoroughly investigated using broadband photometry predominantly from Kepler, K2, and TESS. Here we present a spectroscopic investigation of superflares on the very active spectroscopic binary CC~Eri. We focus on spectroscopic signatures of (super)-flares and line asymmetries with the goal to characterize superflares spectroscopically. In 70 nights of spectroscopic observations obtained at the ESO~1.52m telescope with the Echelle spectrograph PUCHEROS+ hosted by the PLATOSpec consortium we identified 31 flares from which two are superflares already from the deduced g'-band energies. We also find a broad blue-wing asymmetry occurring in the impulsive phase of another superflare which shows great potential to be a prominence eruption. For the second most luminous flare we find the largest number of excess emissions during the impulsive and gradual flare. We identify the flare to be occurring close to the stellar limb which indicates that the flare was even more energetic than derived from its g'-band and spectral line energies. We identify more than sixty spectral lines in the spectral range of 4100 and 7200Å showing excess emission during this flare. We detect continuum enhancements as well as photospheric line fillings during the flare. Generally we find that depending on the flare energy the number of spectral lines revealing excess emission increases, especially for the more energetic superflares. We therefore conclude that superflares are likely scaled-up versions of less energetic normal flares.",

We then reassessed cluster memberships using the {\\tt pyUPMASK} algorithm with {\\it Gaia} DR3 and performed isochrone fitting to derive physical parameters for each cluster, including age, distance modulus, mean reddening, and metallicity. Finally, we empirically identified straggler stars based on their positions relative to the best-fitting isochrone, zero-age main sequence (ZAMS), and equal-mass binary sequence on the CMD. In total, we identified 272 new straggler stars in 99 open clusters, comprising 153 blue stragglers, 98 probable blue stragglers, and 21 yellow stragglers.

Toonen, E. Laplace, F. Dosopoulou Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Although mass transfer (MT) has been studied primarily in circular binaries, observations show that it also occurs in eccentric systems. We investigate orbital evolution during non-conservative MT in eccentric orbits, a process especially relevant for binaries containing compact objects (COs). We examine four angular momentum loss (AML) modes; Jeans, isotropic re-emission, orbital-AML and $L_2$ mass loss -- the latter is the most efficient AML mode. For fixed AML mode and accretion efficiency, orbital evolution is correlated: orbits either widen while becoming more eccentric, or shrink while circularizing. Jeans mode generally yields orbital widening and eccentricity pumping, whereas $L_2$ mass loss typically leads to orbital shrinkage and eccentricity damping. Isotropic re-emission and orbital-AML show intermediate behavior. Adopting isotropic re-emission, we demonstrate that eccentric MT produces compact binaries that merge via gravitational waves (GW) within a Hubble time, whereas the same systems would instead merge during MT under traditional modeling. We further show that, in eccentric orbits, the gravitational potential at $L_2$ becomes lower than at $L_1$ across large range of mass ratios and eccentricities, naturally linking eccentricity to $L_2$ mass loss. Since interacting binaries containing COs are frequently eccentric, $L_2$ mass loss offers a new robust pathway to orbital tightening during eccentric MT, contributing to the formation rate of GW sources. This model can treat orbital evolution due to conservative and non-conservative MT in arbitrary eccentricities with applications ranging from MT on the main sequence to GW progenitors.",

      "abstract": "Surprisingly Similar: The Mass Function of Gaia Neutron Stars and First-Born Double Neutron Stars Aryanna Schiebelbein-Zwack, L.A.C van Son, Maya Fishbach, Will M. Farr Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The mass distribution of neutron stars encodes information about their formation and binary evolution. We compare the masses of two distinct populations: I) the recently identified Gaia neutron stars in wide orbits with solar-like companions and, II) the assumed first-born recycled pulsar in Galactic double neutron star systems. Naively, one would expect their masses to differ due to both the presumed differences in their evolutionary histories, as well as astrophysical selection effects that can filter out configurations that would merge or be disrupted. Yet, we find that their mass distributions are strikingly similar. Using a two-component Gaussian model, we find that both populations exhibit a narrow component centred near $1.3 \\text{ M}_\\odot$, accompanied by a broader, higher-mass component that extends the distribution toward larger masses. The highest density regions of their fitted parameter posteriors coincide by over 91.6%. Statistical tests further confirm the agreement between these distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence $JS < 0.08$ and an earth mover's distance of $W <0.063 \\text{ M}_\\odot$ at 90% credibility. This finding seems to imply that both mass functions reflect the natal mass distribution of first-born neutron stars in binary systems, supporting the hypothesis that neutron stars can be born with high masses. Consequently and perhaps surprisingly, binary evolutionary processes need not impart features on the NS mass distribution.",

However, the ability to observe evidence of Earth-like life through biosignatures is limited by the number of planets in the solar neighborhood with conditions similar to Earth. The occurrence rate of Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars, $\\eta_{\\oplus}$, is therefore crucial for addressing the apparent lack of consensus on its value in the literature. Here we present a review of the current understanding of $\\eta_{\\oplus}$. We first provide definitions for parameters that contribute to $\\eta_{\\oplus}$. Then, we discuss the previous and current estimated parameter values and the context of the limitations on the analyses that produced these estimates. We compile an extensive list of the factors that go into any calculation of $\\eta_{\\oplus}$, and how detection techniques and surveys differ in their sensitivity and ability to accurately constrain $\\eta_{\\oplus}$. Understanding and refining the value of $\\eta_{\\oplus}$ is crucial for upcoming missions and telescopes, such as the planned Habitable Worlds Observatory and the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets, which aim to search for biosignatures on exoplanets in the solar neighborhood.",

      "abstract": "The evolution of accretor stars in binary systems due to accretion of increasingly helium-rich material Sean Richards, Jan Eldridge, Sohan Ghodla, Max Briel Accepted for publication in MNRAS Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The recent discovery of examples of intermediate-mass helium stars have offered new insights into interacting binaries. These observations will allow significant improvements in our understanding of helium stars. However, in the creation of these stars their companions may accrete a significant amount of helium-rich stellar material. These creates stars with unusual composition profiles -- stars with helium-rich cores, hydrogen-rich lower envelopes and a helium-rich outer envelope. Thus the mean molecular weight reaches a minimum in the the middle of the star rather than continuously decreasing outwards in mass. To demonstrate this structure we present Cambridge STARS model calculations of an example interacting binary systems where the helium-rich material is transferred, and compare it to one where the composition of the accreted mass is fixed to the companion's surface composition. We show that the helium-rich material leads to the accretor being 0.2 dex hotter and 0.15 dex more luminous than models where the composition is not helium rich. We use a simple BPASS v2.2 population model to estimate that helium-rich mass transfer occurs in 23 per cent of massive binaries that undergo mass transfer. This suggests this is a common process. This binary process has implications for the discrepancy between spectroscopic and gravitational masses of stars, the production of ionizing photons and possibly the modelling of high redshift galaxies.",

Afanasyev 11 pages, 5 figures, submitted to Astrophysical Journal on October 23, 2025 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Understanding the three-dimensional evolution of coronal magnetic fields during solar flares remains challenging due to the lack of direct coronal field measurements. Here we combine data-driven MHD simulations of NOAA AR 11158 (Fan et al., 2024) with flare-ribbon and coronal-dimming observations to investigate realistic coronal magnetic-field evolution during an X-class flare. We introduce L-maps, maps of the logarithm of magnetic field line lengths, as a diagnostic tool to track the dynamics of simulated coronal magnetic structures. Variations in L-maps identify flare ribbons through field-line shortening and coronal dimmings through field-line lengthening. Comparison with SDO/AIA observations demonstrates strong morphological and temporal agreement, validating the simulated field evolution. Applying K-means clustering to the L-map temporal profiles, we distinguish three stages of coronal evolution: (1) slow pre-flare rise phase, (2) flare reconnection accompanied by CME rise, and (3) post-reconnection CME expansion. We detect a slow pre-flare rise phase of magnetic field lines rooted in ribbon footpoints and identify a new phenomenon, reconnection dimming, a rapid expansion of reconnected inner flux-rope field lines during the impulsive phase. Our results show that L-maps provide a powerful and physically intuitive framework for bridging simulations and observations and for tracking the full three-dimensional evolution of coronal magnetic fields during flares.",

The manuscript is being submitted for peer review Space Physics (physics.space-ph); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Extreme space weather events on Earth occur during intervals of strong solar wind driving. The solar wind drives plasma convection and currents in the near-Earth space environment. For low values of the driver, the Earth's response is linear, estimated by parameters such as the polar cap index based on ground magnetometer activity. Curiously, for extreme solar wind driving, the Earth's response appears not to increase beyond a saturation limit. Theorists have advanced a host of explanations for this saturation effect, but there is no consensus. Here, we demonstrate that the saturation is a manifestation of the regression to the mean effect resulting from random uncertainty in the time and magnitude of solar wind measurements. Our results reveal that data analysis underpinning the saturation theories is non-linearly biased; hence, the theories must be validated against the correct solar wind data. Correcting for the uncertainties reveals that the Earth's response to solar wind driving is linear throughout, and the impact of extreme geomagnetic storms can be twice as large as previously thought. We show that regression to the mean is a fundamental property of the relationship between measurement and the truth, where the truth corresponding to the measurement is closer to the mean. This effect is particularly pronounced for uncertain measurements of extreme values and is likely to manifest across various fields, from extreme climate studies to chronic medical pain.",

The equation of state considers the thermodynamic properties of hydrogen-helium mixtures and heavy elements, improving the accuracy of internal structure calculations. We also present modifications to the radiative opacity to allow the modelling of grains, clouds and opacity windows. Furthermore, we refine the treatment of convective mixing processes in MESA to better replicate convective mixing with the presence of composition gradients. Finally, we add a treatment for helium rain and settling. These modifications aim to enhance the predictive capabilities of MESA for giant planet evolution and are publicly available.

It features a 500 um pixel pitch, in-pixel amplification and digitization, and low power consumption (around 3-4 mW/cm^2), making it scalable for large-area, multilayer telescope detector planes. The detectors have a designed dynamic range of 25 keV to 700 keV. With these features, AstroPix meets the requirements of future space-based high-energy telescopes and the imaging layers of the Barrel Imaging Calorimeter (BIC) in the Electron-Proton/Ion Collider (ePIC) detector at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). For the space-based payload, AstroPix is being integrated into sounding rocket and balloon payloads to demonstrate the technical readiness of the devices. For BIC, AstroPix-based imaging layers interleaved within the lead/scintillating-fiber (Pb/SciFi) sampling calorimeter provide granular shower imaging, enabling key performance features such as electron/pion or gamma/neutral-pion separation. As part of the ongoing detector R&D efforts, we have been testing various AstroPix v3 configurations: the single chip, a quad-chip assembly, a three-layer stack of quad chips, and a nine-chip module that represents the smallest prototype unit of the BIC imaging layer. This presentation will highlight recent performance test results from these AstroPix detector configurations.",

Compensating these effects is therefore critical to realizing the potential of upcoming extremely large telescopes, a challenging task that requires precise wavefront control. Ultimately, this precision is limited by one's wavefront sensor (WFS) and its capacity to accurately encode phase and amplitude aberrations. Aims: Our attention is on photon noise-limited wavefront sensing in the high-Strehl regime. In particular, we seek fundamental limits to phase and amplitude estimation in addition to a WFS that saturate these bounds. Methods: Information theory is employed for deriving minimum-achievable residual errors, as stipulated by a metric called the Holevo Cramer-Rao bound. Holevo's bound is closely related to another metric called the quantum Cramer-Rao bound, which has already been applied to phase estimation on nearly-corrected wavefronts. Results: We present a WFS that can perfectly extract and phase shift a telescope's piston mode. We show how this phase can be used to tune the apparatus' sensitivity to phase and amplitude, and provide a closed-form expression for the optimal phase shift. For circular apertures, this implementation saturates the fundamental limits, but it can be easily modified to work with arbitrary pupils. Moreover, our proposal uses optics that are manufactureable today and is readily achromatized with geometric phase shifters.",

However, humans are not the only instance of an intelligent, communicating species on Earth, and thus not guide to how we might think about ETI. Here, we explore the potential for the study of non-human species to inform new approaches in SETI research, using firefly communication patterns as an illustrative example. Fireflies communicate their presence through evolved flash patterns distinct from complex visual backgrounds. Extraterrestrial signals may also be identifiable not by their complexity or decodable content, but by the structural properties of the signal, as currently being explored in efforts to decode communication in non-human species across our biosphere. We present a firefly-inspired model for detecting potential technosignatures within environments dominated by ordered astronomical phenomena, such as pulsars. Using pulsar data from the Australia Telescope National Facility, we generate simulated signals that exhibit evolved dissimilarity from the surrounding pulsar population. This approach shifts focus from anthropocentric assumptions about intelligence toward recognizing communication through its fundamental structural properties, specifically, evolutionarily optimized contrast with natural backgrounds. Our model demonstrates that alien signals need not be inherently complicated nor need we decipher their meaning to identify them; rather, signals might be distinguishable as products of selection. We discuss implications for broadening SETI methodologies, leveraging the diverse forms of intelligence found on Earth.",

It aims to explore and study high-energy cosmic phenomena, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). This unprecedented combination of space-based and ground-based instruments will provide leading multi-wavelength observational capabilities in gamma-rays, X-rays, optical, and near-infrared bands. The complete observation sequence of each GRB triggered by the SVOM mission consists of three stages, the GRB detections, followed by the on-board and grounded automatic follow-ups, and rapid deep multi-band photometry and spectroscopy re-visit observations. To efficiently organize all grounded instruments performing automatic follow-ups and re-visit observations, we develop a follow-up observation coordinating service (FOCS), which is capable of performing GRB trigger distributing, automatic observation scheduling and observation coordination supporting by providing a user support platform. The FOCS also facilitates the provision of observational planning for ground-based telescopes to conduct synchronized observations of identical celestial regions as SVOM. The FOCS is utilized for the SVOM-dedicated ground-based telescopes as well as for associated partner telescopes. Since the launch of SVOM in June 2024, as the FOCS system joining the operations of SVOM, multiple successful observations have been made for SVOM GRBs. In this paper, we present the goals of the FOCS system as well as the principle and workflow developed to achieve these goals. The structure, technical design, implementation, and performance of the FOCS system are also described in detail. We conclude with a summary of the current status of the FOCS system and our near-future development plan.",

Accepted for publication in MNRAS Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, staf1952 (2025) Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Pulsar searching with next-generation radio telescopes requires efficiently sifting through millions of candidates generated by search pipelines to identify the most promising ones. This challenge has motivated the utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based tools. In this work, we explore an optimized pulsar search pipeline that utilizes deep learning to sift ``snapshot'' candidates generated by folding de-dispersed time series data. This approach significantly accelerates the search process by reducing the time spent on the folding step. We also developed a script to generate simulated pulsars for benchmarking and model fine-tuning. The benchmark analysis used the NGC 5904 globular cluster data and simulated pulsar data, showing that our pipeline reduces candidate folding time by a factor of $\\sim$10 and achieves 100% recall by recovering all known detectable pulsars in the restricted parameter space. We also tested the speed-up using data of known pulsars from a single observation in the Southern-sky MWA Rapid Two-metre (SMART) survey, achieving a conservatively estimated speed-up factor of 60 in the folding step over a large parameter space. We tested the model's ability to classify pulsar candidates using real data collected from the FAST, GBT, MWA, Arecibo, and Parkes, demonstrating that our method can be generalized to different telescopes. The results show that the optimized pipeline identifies pulsars with an accuracy of 0.983 and a recall of 0.9844 on the real dataset. This approach can be used to improve the processing efficiency for the SMART and is also relevant for future SKA pulsar surveys.",

Among its key observational modes, slitless spectral observation allows simultaneous imaging and spectral data acquisition over a wide field of view, offering significant advantages for astrophysical studies. Currently, the CSST is in the development phase and lacks real observational data. As a result, the development of its data processing pipeline and scientific pre-research must rely on the mock data generated through simulations. This work focuses on developing a simulation framework for the CSST slitless spectral imaging system, analyzing its spectral dispersing properties and structural design. Additionally, the detection performance of the slitless spectral system is assessed for various astrophysical targets. Simulation results demonstrate that nearly all 1st order spectra are accompanied by corresponding 0th order images, facilitating accurate source identification. Furthermore, the GI spectral band exhibits superior detection efficiency compared to the GV and GU bands, establishing it as the primary observational band for stellar and galactic studies. This work successfully develops a simulation framework for the CSST slitless spectroscopic equipment.",

An integrated system model incorporating five static and two dynamic error sub-models was established. Wavefront errors were calculated for each sub-model and compared to the integrated system error to quantify the individual contributions to image degradation. At the detector level, wavefront error, point spread function (PSF), and ellipticity were evaluated across the full field of view (FOV). The average radius of 80\\% encircled energy (REE80) of the PSF under full-error conditions was determined for 25 field points, yielding a value of 0.114 arcseconds. Furthermore, the calculations indicate a correlation between the wavefront distribution and the ellipticity distribution within the optical system. By optimizing the wavefront distribution, it is possible to adjust the ellipticity distribution of the PSF across the full FOV. The end-to-end simulation approach adopted in this paper provides a theoretical foundation for improving the image quality in large-aperture, off-axis space telescopes.",

The actual stray-light level during observations depends not only on the telescope's inherent stray-light suppression capability but also on its operational orbit conditions. Accurate estimation of stray-light levels is crucial for assessing image quality and performing realistic scientific simulations. To rapidly estimate stray-light levels under realistic, complex operational conditions, we developed an analytical model tailored to the China Space Station Telescope (CSST). Our model simulates stray-light backgrounds generated by off-field sources such as moonlight, starlight, and earthshine, incorporating the effects of zodiacal light, as well as scattering and ghost images induced by bright in-field stars. The proposed method allows quick and accurate evaluation of stray-light conditions, facilitating both image simulation and observational scheduling.",

The analysis integrates the definition of the mission profile, the instrumental concept architecture, and an error budget that breaks down the key contributors to the sub-micro arcses precision required for a single measurement. A portion of this budget addresses photo-center estimation for both the target and calibration stars used in differential astrometry. Other major contributors are related to instrumental control of systematics in the reconstruction of differential angle measurements from pixel data (focal plane calibration) to on sky line of sight (telescope distortion calibration). End-of-mission astrometry requires multiple observations (typically 100) of the same target distributed over the mission lifetime. We assess the mission profile to estimate the fraction of survey time required for astrometric survey to achieve the science objective. The proposed architecture of the instrument concept is derived from error budget and mission constraints based on a large visible detector array composed of an assembly of multiple CMOS sensor chips resulting in an overall gigapixel focal plane. We evaluate the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and propose a way forward reaching TRL 5 level for key technologies by the Mission Consolidation Review in 2029.",

Impacts of pipeline-level differences on retrieval posteriors Simon Schleich, Sudeshna Boro Saikia, Quentin Changeat, Manuel Güdel, Aiko Voigt, Ingo Waldmann 20 pages, 12 figures. Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Since the launch of JWST, observations of exoplanetary atmospheres have seen a revolution in data quality. Given that atmospheric parameter inferences depend heavily on the underlying data, a re-evaluation of current methodologies is warranted to assess the reliability of these results. We investigate the impact of variations in input spectra on atmospheric retrievals for the hot Jupiter WASP-39 b using JWST transit data. Specifically, we analyse the reliability of parameter estimations from random perturbations of the underlying spectrum and their sensitivity to three transmission spectra derived from the same observational data. Using the NIRSpec PRISM observation from a single transit of WASP-39 b, we perform retrievals with the TauREx framework. As a baseline, we use a spectrum derived with the Eureka! data reduction pipeline. To evaluate retrieval reliability, we analyse posterior distributions under deviations from this spectrum. We simulate random noise by performing retrievals on scattered instances of this spectrum and compare them with retrievals based on existing spectra reduced from the same raw observation. Our analysis identifies three types of posterior distributions: (1) Stable, Gaussian distributions for species constrained across the entire spectrum (e.g., H2O, CO2); (2) Uniform posteriors with upper bounds for weakly constrained species (e.g., CO, CH4); and (3) Unstable, heavy-tailed posteriors for species constrained by minor spectrum features (e.g., SO2, C2H2). We find that other parameters, such as the planetary radius and p-T profile, are stable under spectral perturbations. Posterior distributions differ for retrievals on independently reduced transmission spectra from the same raw data, complicating interpretation, particularly for skewed distributions. Based on this, we advocate for careful assessment and selection of credible interval sizes to reflect this.",

As computing power per cost has decreased, there has been a move towards larger arrays of smaller dishes, such as DSA-2000, the upcoming HIRAX, CHORD and SKA radio telescopes. Such arrays can have simpler receiver designs with room-temperature low-noise amplifiers and direct sampling to achieve, greatly reducing the cost per antenna. The ARGOS project is currently developing an array of five 6-meter antennas that will be used to demonstrate the technology required for a next generation \"small-D, big-N\" radio interferometer in Europe. In this work, our objective was to implement a first-stage digital signal processing system for the ARGOS demonstrator array, providing digitization, channelization, delay correction and frequency-dependent complex gain correction. The system is intended to produce delay and phase corrected dual-polarization channelized voltages in the frequency range 1-3 GHz with a nominal channel bandwidth of 1 MHz. We use an RFSoC 4x2 evaluation board with four analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) that can simultaneously sample two 1 GHz, dual-polarization bands. We use Xilinx Vitis HLS C++ to develop the required firmware as a set of customizable modules suitable for rapid prototyping. We performed hardware verification of the channel response of the critically sampled PFB and of the delay correction, showing both to be consistent with theoretical expectations. Furthermore, the board was installed at the Effelsberg 100-meter radio telescope where we performed commensal pulsar observations with the Effelsberg Direct Digitization backend, showing comparable performance. This work demonstrates the utility of high-level synthesis (HLS) languages in the development of high performance radio astronomy processing backends.",

Astronomical spectra exemplify this challenge: massive surveys have collected millions of spectra across a wide range of wavelengths and resolutions, yet analyses remain fragmented across spectral domains (e.g., optical vs. infrared) and object types (e.g., stars vs. galaxies), limiting the ability to pool information across datasets. We present a deep learning model that jointly learns from heterogeneous spectra in a self-supervised manner. Our universal spectral tokenizer processes spectra from a variety of object types and resolutions directly on their native wavelength grids, producing intrinsically aligned, homogeneous, and physically meaningful representations that can be efficiently adapted to achieve competitive performance across a range of downstream tasks. For the first time, we demonstrate that a single model can unify spectral data across resolutions and domains, suggesting that our model can serve as a powerful building block for foundation models in astronomy -- and potentially extend to other scientific domains with heterogeneous sequential data, such as climate and healthcare.",

Kühn, Laura Perez, Gael Chauvin Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) High-contrast imaging relies on advanced coronagraphs and adaptive optics (AO) to attenuate the starlight. However, residual aberrations, especially non-common path aberrations between the AO channel and the coronagraph channel, limit the instrument performance. While post-processing techniques such as spectral or angular differential imaging (ADI) can partially address those issues, they suffer from self-subtraction and inefficiencies at small angular separations or when observations are conducted far from transit. We previously demonstrated the on-sky performance of coherent differential imaging (CDI), which offers a promising alternative. It allows for isolating coherent starlight residuals through speckle modulation, which can then be subtracted from the raw images during post-processing. This work aims to validate a CDI method on real science targets, demonstrating its effectiveness in imaging almost face-on circumstellar disks, which are typically challenging to retrieve with ADI. We temporally modulated the speckle field in VLT/SPHERE images, applying small phase offsets on the AO deformable mirror while observing stars surrounded by circumstellar material: HR 4796A, CPD-36 6759, HD 169142, and HD 163296. We hence separated the astrophysical scene from the stellar speckle field, whose lights are mutually incoherent. Combining a dozen of data frames and reference coronagraph point spread functions through a Karhunen-Loève image projection framework, we recover the circumstellar disks without the artifacts that are usually introduced by common post-processing algorithms (e.g., self-subtraction). The CDI method therefore represents a promising strategy for calibrating the effect of static and quasi-static aberrations in future direct imaging surveys. Indeed, it is efficient, does not require frequent telescope slewing, and does not introduce image artifacts to first order.",

Mulders, Ilaria Pascucci, Peter Plavchan 24 pages, 9 figures, submitted to PASP Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) $\\eta_{\\oplus}$, the occurrence rate of rocky habitable zone exoplanets orbiting Sun-like stars, is of great interest to both the astronomical community and the general public. The Kepler space telescope has made it possible to estimate $\\eta_{\\oplus}$, but estimates by different groups vary by more than an order of magnitude. We identify several causes for this range of estimates. We first review why, despite being designed to estimate $\\eta_{\\oplus}$, Kepler's observations are not sufficient for a high-confidence estimate, due to Kepler's detection limit coinciding with the $\\eta_{\\oplus}$ regime. This results in a need to infer $\\eta_{\\oplus}$, for example extrapolating from a regime of non-habitable zone, non-rocky exoplanets. We examine two broad classes of causes that can account for the large discrepancy in $\\eta_\\oplus$ found in the literature: a) differences in definitions and input data between studies, and b) fundamental limits in Kepler data that lead to large uncertainties and poor accuracy. We highlight the risk of large biases when using extrapolation to describe small exoplanet populations in the habitable zone. We discuss how $\\eta_{\\oplus}$ estimates based on Kepler data can be improved, such as reprocessing Kepler data for more complete, higher-reliability detections and better exoplanet catalog characterization. We briefly survey upcoming space telescopes capable of measuring $\\eta_{\\oplus}$, and how they can be used to supplement Kepler data.",

These measurements of HCN, CS, CO, CH$_3$OH, and H$_2$CO (along with continuum emission from dust) sampled molecular chemistry in C/2017 K2 at the inner edge of the H$_2$O sublimation zone, discerning parent from daughter or extended source species. This work presents spectrally integrated flux maps, production rates, and parent scale lengths for each molecule. CH$_3$OH, CO, and HCN were produced within $\\sim$250 km of the nucleus, potentially including contributions from sublimation of icy grains. CS was consistent with production from CS$_2$ photolysis, and H$_2$CO required production from extended sources in the coma. An ortho-to-para ratio OPR=$2.9\\pm0.4$ for H$_2$CO was derived from simultaneously measured transitions of each spin species. The continuum was extended and spatially resolved, consistent with thermal emission from dust in the coma. Analysis of the continuum visibilities provided an upper limit on the nucleus diameter $d<6.6$ km and coma dust masses of $1.2-2.4\\times10^{11}$ kg.",

We introduce a new dynamic model to describe the forms of the striae observed in comets Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1), West (C/1975 V1), and Seki-Lines (C/1962 C1). Charged particles made of refractory materials, with radii less than 0.5 $\\mu m$, are expelled from the comet's nucleus and accelerated by Lorentz forces near the nucleus. These particles decay many times to form striae, which have a lifespan of less than about 100 days at a distance of 1 astronomical unit from the sun. Over time, they continue to decay and eventually disappear from view. The following dynamic model explains these material science processes. Particles expelled from the comet's nucleus are subjected to three forces: solar gravity, solar radiation pressure, and Lorentz forces near the nucleus. As these particles decrease in size, the Lorentz forces and radiation pressure cause fluctuations, increasing and decreasing to form striae. This model, which is less of a dynamic approximation than previous theories (FLM3), explains the structure of the striae, enables predictions of their luminosity, and clarifies their origin.",

These observations, conducted as part of Exoplanet Watch citizen science initiative, were analyzed with the EXOplanet Transit Interpretation Code (EXOTIC) pipeline to generate high-quality light curves and extract precise mid-transit times. By combining our new data with previously published observations, we refined the planet's ephemeris, reducing uncertainties in both the orbital period and mid-transit time. Our final mid-transit value is 2460585.6563426 +/- 0.00001908 BJD_TDB and the final period value is 1.4013776 +/- 0.0000002 days. Our updated timing solution demonstrates a 92% reduction in mid-transit time uncertainty compared to the original discovery paper and improves the precision of transit forecasts through 2030 which is critical to ensure efficient scheduling of future missions, such as ESA's Ariel. This work highlights the critical role of ongoing ground-based observations by students and citizen scientists in maintaining accurate ephemerides, which are essential for planning future space-based follow-up with facilities such as the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes.

We performed 2D hydrodynamical simulations of multiple planets embedded in a circumstellar disk using the PLUTO code, with the addition of dust treated as Lagrangian particles with a multi-size distribution. We carried out a large parameter space analysis to check the influence of disk and planetary properties on the dust component. Planets with $m \\gtrsim 1 \\, M_{\\oplus}$ can open dust gaps for small grains in dense and warm disks (strong coupling) and for large grains in thin and cold disks (weak coupling), without significantly perturbing the gas. In the strong coupling regime, rapid Type I migration can shift the gap location inward or outward with respect to the planetary orbit, depending on the direction of migration. We also find dust gaps that overlap with Lindblad resonances. In the weak coupling regime, planets can create an inner dust cavity, multiple dust rings, or hide inside a common gap. Our results show how low-mass multi-planet systems perturb the dust distribution, which cannot be explained by considering each planet in isolation and has a crucial dependence on local disk conditions and dust grain sizes.",

Planetary interior models based on their observed radius-mass relationship suggest that sub-Neptunes contain a discernible amount of either hydrogen (dry planets) or water (wet planets) blanketing a core composed of rocks and metal \\cite{bean2021nature}. Water-rich sub-Neptunes have been believed to form farther from the star and then migrate inward to their present orbits \\cite{bitsch2021Dry}. Here, we report experimental evidence of reactions between warm dense hydrogen fluid and silicate melt that releases silicon from the magma to form alloys and hydrides at high pressures. We found that oxygen liberated from the silicate melt reacts with hydrogen, producing a significant amount of water up to a few tens of weight percent, which is much greater than previously predicted based on low-pressure ideal gas extrapolation \\cite{misener2023Atmospheresa,schlichting2022Chemical}. Consequently, these reactions can generate a spectrum of water contents in hydrogen-rich planets, with the potential to reach water-rich compositions for some sub-Neptunes, implying an evolutionary relationship between hydrogen-rich and water-rich planets. Therefore, detection of a large amount of water in exoplanet atmospheres may not be the optimal evidence for planet migration in the protoplanetary disk, calling into question the assumed link between composition and planet formation location.",

In this paper, we study the restricted threebody problem known as planetary type (i.e., when the eccentricity of the test particle is small). A method of linearizing the equation of motion close to (but not in) resonance is proposed under the assumption of small perturbations. In other words, we study orbits when the resonant argument circles the resonance. In the practically interesting case of resonant perturbations we can restrict our study to a perturbation with a single frequency with the largest amplitude, and reduce the problem to the Mathieu equation. The model qualitatively describes the behavior of the perturbation in the vicinity of the resonance. It can be used to estimate the exact position of the resonance and the boundaries between neighboring resonances.",

In this work, the measured PAH intensities of a range of disks are compared with ALMA dust continuum images, in order to test whether there is evidence that PAHs are frozen out on pebbles in dust traps and only sublimate under certain conditions. A sample is constructed from 26 T Tauri and Herbig disks located within 300 pc, with constraints on the 3.3 $\\mu$m PAH intensity and with high-resolution ALMA continuum data. The midplane temperature is derived using a power-law or with radiative transfer modeling. The warm dust mass is computed by integrating the flux within the 30 K radius and convert to a dust mass. A strong correlation with a Pearson coefficient of 0.88+/-0.07 between the 3.3 micron PAH intensity and the warm dust mass was found. The correlation is driven by the combination of deep upper limits and strong detections corresponding to a range of warm dust masses. Possible correlations with other disk properties like FUV radiation field or total dust mass are much weaker. Correlations with PAH features at 6.2, 8.6 and 11.3 micron are potentially weaker, but this could be explained by the smaller sample for which these data were available. The correlation is consistent with the hypothesis that PAHs are generally frozen out on pebbles in disks, and are only revealed in the gas phase if those pebbles have drifted towards warm dust traps inside the 30 K radius and vertically transported upwards to the disk atmosphere with sufficiently high temperature to sublimate PAHs into the gas phase. This is similar to previous findings on complex organic molecules in protoplanetary disks and provides further evidence that the chemical composition of the disk is governed by pebble transport.",

Our study reveals that Weywot's orbit deviates significantly from a purely Keplerian model, requiring the inclusion of Quaoar's non-spherical gravitational field and center-of-body-center-of-light (COB-COL) offsets in our orbit models. We place a robust upper limit on Weywot's orbital eccentricity ($e<0.02$), substantially lower than previous estimates, which has important implications for the strength of mean motion resonances (MMRs) acting on Quaoar's ring system. Under the assumption that Quaoar's rings lie in its equatorial plane, we detect Quaoar's dynamical oblateness, $J_2$, at $\\sim$2$\\sigma$ confidence. The low $J_2$ value found under that assumption implies Quaoar is differentiated, with a total bulk density of $1751\\pm13$ (stat.) kg m$^{-3}$. Additionally, we detect significant COB-COL offsets likely arising from latitudinal albedo variations across Quaoar's surface. These offsets are necessary to achieve a statistically robust orbit fit and highlight the importance of accounting for surface heterogeneity when modeling the orbits of dwarf planet moons. These findings improve our understanding of Quaoar's interior and surface while providing key insights into the stability and confinement mechanisms of its rings.",

Rommel, Cameron Collyer, Will M. Grundy, Estela Fernández-Valenzuela Benjamin Proudfoot et al 2025 ApJL 993 L38 Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Recent observations of a stellar occultation have revealed the presence of a previously undiscovered small satellite around Quaoar. Orbiting near Quaoar's unusual ring system, this new satellite has the potential to provide significant insights into the formation and evolution of Quaoar and its ring system. In this letter, we characterize the orbit of this newly discovered satellite, finding that it is likely on a $3.6^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$-day orbit, plausibly placing it near a 5:3 mean motion resonance with Quaoar's outermost known ring. Examining the possibility of observing the newly discovered satellite with further stellar occultations, we estimate that $\\sim$hundreds of observing stations are required for recovery, since phase information about its orbit was rapidly lost after the lone detection. We also attempted to recover the satellite in JWST NIRCam imaging of Quaoar, but find no convincing detection. This non-detection is limited by the accuracy of the available NIRCam PSF models, as well as the satellite's extreme faintness and close-in orbital separation. Therefore, current-generation telescopes will likely struggle to directly image this new satellite, but near-future 30-meter-class telescopes should prove capable of detecting it. Discovery of such a satellite provides evidence that the rings around Quaoar may have been part of an initially broad collisional disk that has evolved considerably since its formation. To further explore this hypothesis, we encourage follow-up observations of the rings and satellites with stellar occultations and direct imaging, as well as updated hydrodynamical, collisional, and tidal modeling of the system.",

In contrast, no rings have been observed around any inner Solar System objects. To constrain the dynamical origin of this ringed-versus-ringless dichotomy, we employ a numerically cross-checked analytical model of gigayear-scale Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag due to the solar flux acting on an isolated particle, expressed as a function of the host body's heliocentric distance \\(\\,a_{\\mathrm{pla}}\\) and the particle radius \\(\\,r_{\\mathrm{par}}\\). Here we show that, in the absence of additional perturbations, PR drag alone can explain the observed ring architecture of the Solar System: outer planets and Centaurs/TNOs are able to retain rings for the age of the Solar System, whereas any rings around the inner planets are removed on much shorter timescales. Because the PR-drag lifetime scales steeply with heliocentric distance \\(\\bigl(\\tau_{\\mathrm{decay}}\\propto a_{\\mathrm{pla}}^{2} \\,r_{\\mathrm{par}}\\bigr)\\), we predict that forthcoming surveys will reveal an ever-growing population of ring-bearing bodies in the distant Solar System.",

Pankaj Mehta, Jane Kondev 15 pages, 2 Figures, SI, v2: small changes, typos fixed Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech) In the 1970s, the renowned physicist Victor Weisskopf famously developed a research program to qualitatively explain properties of matter in terms of the fundamental constants of physics. But there was one type of matter prominently missing from Weisskopf's analysis: life. Here, we develop Weisskopf-style arguments demonstrating how the fundamental constants of physics can be used to understand the properties of living systems. By combining biophysical arguments and dimensional analysis, we show that vital properties of chemical self-replicators, such as growth yield, minimum doubling time, and minimum power consumption in dormancy, can be quantitatively estimated using fundamental physical constants. The calculations highlight how the laws of physics constrain chemistry-based life on Earth, and if it exists, elsewhere in our universe.",
