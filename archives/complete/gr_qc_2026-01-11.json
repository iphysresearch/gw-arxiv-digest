The construction is motivated by an $E_6\\times E_6$ framework in which $SU(3)_R\\rightarrow SU(2)_R\\times U(1)_{Y'}\\rightarrow U(1)_{\\rm dem}$, leaving a healthy repulsive $U(1)_{\\rm dem}$ interaction whose charge is the square-root mass label. Gravity itself arises from the $SU(2)_R$ connection via a Plebanski/MacDowell--Mansouri mechanism, yielding an emergent tetrad and the Einstein--Hilbert action. MOND is implemented by an infrared (IR) metric deformation $\\Delta S_{\\rm IR}[g]$ that is UV-vanishing (so GR is recovered) while its deep-MOND/static limit is fixed by a symmetry principle: in three spatial dimensions, the deep-MOND action is conformally invariant with a 10-parameter group isomorphic to $SO(4,1)$ (the de Sitter group). The single MOND acceleration scale is set by a de Sitter radius selected dynamically in the IR, $a_0=c^2/(\\xi\\,\\ell_{\\rm dS})$ with $\\xi={ O}(1)$ fixed by matching to the static limit. MOND resides in perturbations and quasistatic systems; the homogeneous FRW background is controlled by the IR vacuum kinematics rather than an ad hoc cosmological constant.",

      "abstract": "Could black hole thermodynamics play a role in black hole mergers? George Ruppeiner General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers yield values for both the black hole remnant mass $M$ and it's spin $a$, with the $169$ $a$ values collected so far crowding significantly around their average $\\bar{a}=0.6869\\pm 0.087$. Could this crowding relate directly to the Davies phase transition point at $a=0.68125$ from black hole thermodynamics? I argue that a necessary challenge for such a connection requires a consistent application of the thermodynamic fluctuation theory that follows from black hole thermodynamics (BHT). Specifically, necessary are a correct choice of fluctuating variables, as well as thermal equilibrium between the event horizon at the Hawking temperature $\\sim \\mu K$ and the outside universe $\\sim 3 K$. I show that the former requirement follows in straightforward fashion from the BHT of the Kerr model, while the later requires an accretion disk following the Novikov-Thorne accretion disk model. I construct a thermodynamic fluctuation theory meeting both these requirements. My results open the possibility that black hole mergers are based on some dynamical model (not known to me) with a limiting attractor state at the Davies point.",

We start our investigation with the Granda-Oliveros (GO) cutoff, i.e., $L=(\\gamma H^{2}+\\delta\\dot{H})^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$, and highlight the range of allowed $\\alpha$ (Lévy's index) values for which big, little and pseudo rip can occur. In particular, we highlight the occurrence of a big rip for fractional values of the Lévy's index in the allowed range $1<\\alpha\\leq2$. Moreover, we conclude that the occurrence of a pseudo-rip requires Lévy's index to be $\\alpha>2$. Therefore, we reject the possibility of pseudo-rip within the GO cutoff. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the occurrence of the little rip in FHDE equipped with a GO cutoff is rather contrived and requires a specific functional form of the IR cutoff $L\\sim(\\gamma H^{2}+g(H))^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$, which belongs to a larger class of Nojiri-Odintsov (NO) cutoffs. To extend our perspective beyond the GO cutoff, we investigate the interacting FHDE framework equipped with the Hubble cutoff, i.e., $L=H^{-1}$, in developing an ansatz-based approach to the little and pseudo-rip singularities as they fail to appear in the GO cutoff. Within this approach, we invoke the expression of the Hubble parameter, $H(t)$, which corresponds to the little and pseudo-rip, into the cosmological parameters such as the Equation of State (EoS) and Squared Sound Speed (SSS) as a function of cosmic time $t$. We produce numerical plots of these parameters in both linear and non-linear $Q$ regimes, which supplement our theoretical findings. In summary, our results highlight the occurrence of little and pseudo-rip singularities within a Hubble cutoff for a non-linear $Q$ term within the FHDE framework.",

      "abstract": "Quasi-Homogeneous Thermodynamics and Microscopic Structure of the Quantum-Corrected FLRW Universe Carlos E. Romero-Figueroa, Hernando Quevedo General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The analysis of phase transitions in cosmological spacetimes shows that their existence requires a time-dependent apparent horizon radius, which in turn implies an equation of state different from that of a dark energy fluid. This condition is not compatible with the simultaneous fulfillment of Hayward's unified gravitational first law and the fundamental thermodynamic equation of the apparent horizon. To solve this problem, we introduce an alternative formulation in which the cosmological horizon is modeled as a quasi-homogeneous thermodynamic system. We apply this approach to the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe under quantum gravity corrections encoded by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), promote the deformation parameter to a thermodynamic variable, and obtain a consistent thermodynamic description without relying on the usual pressure-volume interpretation. Using Geometrothermodynamics (GTD), we show that fluctuations of the GUP parameter can induce phase transitions closely resembling those of black hole configurations. Finally, we perform a numerical analysis of the behavior of the GTD scalar curvature near the phase transition point, where we find a scaling behavior characterized by the critical exponent close to 1, independently of the dimension of the equilibrium space. This reveals that quantum gravity corrections not only modify the thermodynamic consistency of cosmological models but also strengthen the notion of thermodynamic universality across gravitational systems. Our findings confirm GTD as a powerful geometric tool to unveil the emergent thermodynamic microstructure of spacetime.",

Using Friedmann and continuity equations, modified by an effective fractal dimension $D$; we derive generalized slow-roll parameters and examine their evolution for cubic, Starobinsky and Natural inflationary potentials. We then formulate a fractal extension of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation by introducing an effective momentum term $k_{\\text{eff}}$, arising from the fractal decomposition of the spatial Laplacian, that captures the geometric influence of fractal cosmology on scalar perturbations. This leads to corrections in the power spectrum and a scalar spectral index $n_s$ that depends explicitly on both the fractal dimension $D$ and a fractional scale $L$, which controls the strength of the fractal deformation.

      "abstract": "Dynamical system approach to the spectral (in)stability of black holes under localised potential perturbations T. Torres, S. R. Dolan General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The aim of this work is to improve understanding of the resonant spectra of black holes under perturbations arising from e.g. compact objects or accretion disks in their vicinity. It is known that adding a weak perturbation to the radial potential can strongly disrupt the spectrum of quasinormal modes and Regge poles of a black hole spacetime. Here we examine the effect of (weak or strong) localised delta-function perturbations on the resonant spectra of spherically-symmetric systems, to address fundamental questions around linear and non-linear spectral stability. We examine two cases: the Nariai spacetime with a Poschl-Teller potential and the Schwarzschild spacetime. We show that, in either case, the spectrum deforms in a smooth and continuous manner as the position and strength of the perturbation is varied. As the strength of the perturbation is increased, resonances migrate along trajectories in the complex plane which ultimately tend towards attracting points determined by a hard-wall scenario. However, for weak perturbations the trajectory near the unperturbed resonance is typically strongly influenced by a set of repelling points which, for perturbations far from the system, lie very close to the unperturbed resonances; hence there arises a non-linear instability (i.e. the failure of a linearised approximation). Taking a dynamical systems perspective, the sets of attracting and repelling spectral points follow their own trajectories as the position of the perturbation is varied, and these are tracked and understood.",

By analyzing photon trajectories in this background spacetime, we show how the model parameters affect light propagation, leading to wider ranges of lensed trajectories and photon rings. We identify regions of parameter space that admit physically consistent black hole shadows, characterized by the existence of a photon sphere located outside the event horizon and a shadow formed beyond it. These viable regions expand with increasing electric charge and increasing fR0, illustrating the interplay between gravitational and electromagnetic effects. By constraining the model using Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87*, we find that de Sitter black hole solutions remain compatible with the observational data, whereas anti-de Sitter solutions are disfavored for low electric charge and fR0 > -1. Finally, an analysis of the energy emission rate shows that higher electric charge enhances black hole evaporation, while stronger nonlinear electrodynamics effects and larger values of fR0 suppress it.",

Saffin, Qi-Xin Xie General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Boson stars have been extensively studied in classical gravity, but their quantum properties remain comparatively unexplored. In this paper, we compute the quantum scalar fields and stress tensor in boson star spacetimes within the framework of semiclassical gravity. Divergences are regularized using Pauli-Villars fields, and accurate numerical results are obtained through spectral methods. Employing coherent states enables a direct comparison between the classical part of the stress tensor and the quantum fluctuation. Our results indicate that strong spacetime curvature is the primary source of large quantum effects. The renormalized quantum energy density is mostly positive but the radial pressure is negative, suggesting that classical boson star solutions require modification once quantum effects are included. Moreover, in regimes of large curvature, the quantum fluctuations can constitute a significant fraction of the total stress tensor. The methods developed here can be generalized to other compact objects and used to study their response to quantum corrections.",

Schmidt, Stefan Floerchinger (17 + 6) pages, 12 figures, comments are welcome General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas) The quantum-field-theoretic description for the U(1)-Goldstone boson of a scalar Bose-Einstein condensate with time-dependent contact interactions is developed beyond the acoustic approximation in accordance with Bogoliubov theory. The resulting effective action is mapped to a relativistic quantum field theory on a dispersive (or rainbow) cosmological spacetime which has a superluminal Corley-Jacobson dispersion relation. Time-dependent changes of the s-wave scattering length to quantum-simulate cosmological particle production are accompanied by a time-dependent healing length that can be interpreted as an analog Planck length in the comoving frame. Non-adiabatic transitions acquire a dispersive character, which is thoroughly discussed. The framework is applied to exponentially expanding or power-law contracting $(2+1)$-dimensional spacetimes which are known to produce scale-invariant cosmological power spectra. The sensitivity of these scenarios to the time-dependence of the Bogoliubov dispersion is investigated: We find a violation of scale-invariance via analytically trackable Transplanckian damping effects if the cut-off scale is not well separated from the horizon-crossing scale. In case of the exponential expansion, these damping effects remarkably settle and converge to another scale-invariant plateau in the far ultraviolet regime where non-adiabatic transitions are suppressed by the high dispersion. The developed framework enables quantitative access to more drastic analog cosmological scenarios with improved predictability in the ultraviolet regime that ultimately may lead to the observation of a scale-invariant cosmological power spectrum in the laboratory.",

Tootle, Terrence Pierre Jacques, Marie Cassing General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We present new initial data codes for constructing stationary, axisymmetric equilibrium models of differentially rotating neutron stars in full general relativity within the Frankfurt University/KADATH (FUKA) suite of initial data codes. FUKA leverages the KADATH spectral library to solve the Einstein equations under the assumption of an isentropic fluid without magnetic fields while incorporating GRHayLEOS to support 3D tabulated equations of state in \\textit{stellar collapse} format. The two solvers explored in this work include one using quasi-isotropic coordinates (QIC) in Spherical coordinates while the other solves the eXtended Conformal Thin Sandwich (XCTS) decomposition in Cartesian coordinates, enabling the construction of equilibrium configurations with high accuracy and efficiency. In this work we adopt the Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu differential rotation law, however, the code is designed to be extensible to other rotation laws, allowing for exploration of physically relevant sequences and critical rotation thresholds. Furthermore, we perform convergence tests demonstrating the exponential accuracy of the spectral approach, we validate QIC and XCTS solutions against models well-studied in the literature, and we also compare FUKA solutions against the well-known RNS code. Finally, we explore the impact that initial data resolution has on dynamical simulations and recover the convergence order of the evolution scheme, the dominate source of error in this study. The new FUKA codes and results presented here lay the foundation for future extensions to more general configurations, including magnetic fields, removal of isentropic assumptions, and binary systems, and have been made publicly available to support community efforts in modeling differentially rotating relativistic stars.",

[1] and derive a complete set of local consistency conditions for bulk fields in braneworld scenarios with an arbitrary number of dimensions. This provides the first fully local and dimension-independent generalization of all known criteria for bulk fields. Within this framework, we show that a free scalar field is consistent and localized, whereas minimally and non-minimally coupled Maxwell fields violate the conditions, leading to a no-go theorem valid in any dimension. For nonlinear electrodynamics, we find that only the model $L(F)=b\\sqrt{F}$ admits a consistent and normalizable zero mode, and that among p-forms, consistency occurs solely for the free 0-form. We also demonstrate that Dirac fermions, with or without Yukawa terms, are inconsistent within this framework and therefore cannot propagate in the bulk. Our local approach makes explicit that these conclusions do not depend on any particular internal geometry or warp factor: previously known results arise merely as special cases of a broader and strictly local structure, highlighting the universality of the constraints derived here.",

These problems are usually `fixed' by postulating the existence of a scalar field (called the ``inflaton''). However, other less ad hoc options are possible. In the running vacuum model (RVM) framework, the vacuum energy density (VED) is a function of the Hubble rate $H$ and its time derivatives: $\\rho_{\\rm vac}=\\rho_{\\rm vac}(H, \\dot{H},\\ddot{H},\\dots)$. In this context, the VED is dynamical (there is no rigid cosmological constant $\\Lambda$). In the FLRW epoch, $\\rho_{\\rm vac}$ evolves very slowly with expansion, as befits the observed $\\Lambda\\simeq$const. behavior. In contrast, in the very early universe the vacuum fluctuations induce higher powers $H^N$ capable of unleashing fast inflation in a short period in which $H\\simeq$ const. We call this mechanism `RVM-inflation'. It does not require an inflaton field since inflation is brought about by pure quantum field theory (QFT) effects on the dynamical background. It is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant. In this work, we study a closely related scenario: the decay of the exact de Sitter vacuum into FLRW spacetime in its radiation epoch and the subsequent impact on the current universe, and compare with the RVM. We find that in both cases inflation is driven by $H^4$ powers together with subleading contributions of order $H^2$ that ease a graceful-exit transition into the radiation-dominated epoch, where the FLRW regime starts and ultimately develops a mildly evolving VED in the late universe: $\\delta\\rho_{\\rm vac}\\sim {\\cal O}(m_{\\rm Pl} ^2 H^2)$. The outcome is an unified QFT approach to inflation and dark energy (conceived as dynamical vacuum energy) with potentially measurable phenomenological consequences in the present universe which can help to cure the cosmological tensions.",

Here we outline how directly utilizing these constants allows for more straightforward comparisons and hybridizations across the parameter space, as well as more streamlined waveform generation through flux-balance laws. Restricting to the case of nonspinning binaries and first order in self-force, we compute the constants of motion and the corrections to fundamental frequencies numerically as well as analytically (to 9PN in a post-Newtonian expansion), establishing consistency with the highest-order (4PN) results available from post-Newtonian theory.

      "abstract": "Optical Entropy and Generalized Thermodynamics of Solitonic Event Horizons Hasan Oguz Optics (physics.optics); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS) The realization of Hawking radiation in optical analogs has historically focused on kinematic observables, such as the effective temperature determined by the horizon's surface gravity. A complete thermodynamic description, however, necessitates a rigorous definition of entropy and irreversibility, which has remained elusive in Hamiltonian optical systems. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an operational entropy for solitonic event horizons, derived from the spectral partitioning of the optical field into coherent solitonic and incoherent radiative subsystems. We demonstrate that the emission of resonant radiation, mediated by the breaking of soliton integrability due to higher-order dispersion, serves as a fundamental mechanism for entropy production. Numerical simulations of the generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation confirm that this process satisfies a generalized second law, where the change in total entropy is non-negative. These results establish optical event horizons as consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems, offering a new pathway to explore the information-theoretic aspects of analog gravity in laboratory settings.",

We introduce an analytical framework that clarifies the physical origin of this divergence by employing local, coordinate-invariant geometric quantities alongside the properties of the matter distribution. In contrast to conventional formulations -- where the divergence rate $\\bar{a}$ is expressed via coordinate-dependent metric functions -- our approach relates $\\bar{a}$ to the components of the Einstein tensor in an orthonormal basis adapted to the spacetime symmetry. By applying the Einstein equations, we derive the expression \\begin{align*} \\bar{a}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-8\\pi R_{\\mathrm{m}}^2\\left(\\rho_{\\mathrm{m}}+\\Pi_{\\mathrm{m}}\\right)}}, \\end{align*} where $\\rho_{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\Pi_{\\mathrm{m}}$ denote the local energy density and tangential pressure evaluated at the photon sphere of areal radius $R_{\\mathrm{m}}$. This result reveals that $\\bar{a}$ is intrinsically governed by the local matter distribution, with the universal value $\\bar{a}=1$ emerging when $\\rho_{\\mathrm{m}}+\\Pi_{\\mathrm{m}}=0$. Notably, this finding resolves the long-standing puzzle of obtaining $\\bar{a}=1$ in a class of spacetimes supported by a massless scalar field. Furthermore, these local properties are reflected in the frequencies of quasinormal modes, suggesting a profound connection between strong gravitational lensing and the dynamical response of gravitational wave signals.",

We have shown that in most of the relevant cases the program is executable although the two time coordinates may show different durations of cosmological events.

To address the limitations of previous shadow constraints, we construct a standardized framework based on the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini metric to constrain the characteristic parameters of high-dimensional black holes by leveraging observational shadow data. Additionally, we provide a rigorous derivation of the shadow radius formula for a general high-dimensional spherically symmetric black hole. Subsequently, we systematically and comprehensively present the equations of motion and master variables governing spin-0, spin-1, $p$-form, and spin-2 perturbations in high-dimensional static spherically symmetric flat space-time. Our analysis reveals that the Yang-Mills magnetic charge $\\mathcal{Q}$ and the power $q$ have a negligible impact on both the shadow radius and perturbations of the black hole when compared to the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant ${\\alpha}_2$ in various dimensions. Hence, the physical signatures of the parameters $\\mathcal{Q}$ and $q$ in the black hole environment remain undetectable through either perturbation analysis or shadow observations. Cross-validation of the allowable range of ${\\alpha}_2$ derived from the high-dimensional constraint on shadow radius and the dynamical stability analysis of gravitational perturbations demonstrates excellent agreement between these independent approaches. The conclusion of this cross-analysis further substantiates the accuracy of the high-dimensional shadow constraint formula proposed in this work, and we argue that this formula may serve as a universal tool for constraining the characteristic parameters of other high-dimensional spherically symmetric black hole solutions.",

This intriguing feature does not extend to higher-dimensional spacetimes within general relativity, where static black holes can possess non-zero static tidal Love numbers (TLNs). In this work, we have examined the tidal deformation of black holes in Lovelock gravity. We find that, in certain cases within pure Lovelock gravity, the static TLN vanishes, extending the four-dimensional result to specific higher-dimensional settings. On the other hand, black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity consistently exhibit non-zero static TLNs, with their magnitude depending on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant. Exceptions occur only in certain special cases associated with axial perturbations. These results highlight the sensitivity of the multipolar response of a black hole under tidal field, to the underlying theory of gravity and the spacetime dimensions.",

This version corresponds to the accepted version in PRD Phys. Rev. D 113, 024011 (2026) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Black hole spectroscopy is an important pillar when studying gravitational waves from black holes and enables tests of general relativity. Most of the gravitational-wave signals observed over the last decade originate from binary black hole systems. Binary neutron star or black hole-neutron star systems are rarer but of particular interest for the next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. These events offer the exciting possibility of studying matter effects on the ringdown of \"dirty black holes\". In this work, we ask the question: Does matter matter? Using numerical-relativity, we simulate a wide range of collapsing neutron stars producing matter environments, both in isolated scenarios and in binary mergers. Qualitatively, the resulting ringdown signals can be classified into \"clean\", \"modified\", and \"distorted\" cases, depending on the amount of matter that is present. We apply standard strategies for extracting quasinormal modes of clean signals, using both theory-agnostic and theory-specific assumptions. Even in the presence of matter, possible modifications of quasinormal modes seem to be dominated by ringdown modeling systematics. We find that incorporating multiple quasinormal modes allows one to drastically reduce mismatches and errors in estimating the final black hole mass at early times. If not treated carefully, deviations in the fundamental quasinormal mode might artificially be overestimated and falsely attributed to the presence of matter or violations of general relativity.",

While a direct fitting for all signals may be challenging, extracting only one signal will be biased by its overlap with other signals. From this perspective, understanding how the biases arise from the overlapping and their dependence on the signal parameters is crucial for developing effective algorithms. In this work, we extend the anatomy of biases in single-detector cases (Wang et al. 2024) to a detector network. Specifically, we examine how the biases of the chirp mass, symmetric mass ratio, luminosity distance, and coalescence time depend on the source's sky position and orientation, as well as on the coalescence time and phase. We propose a new quantity, named the bias integral, as a useful tool, and establish relationship between the biases in a single detector and that in the entire network, with explicit dependence on extrinsic parameters. Using a 3-detector network as an example, we further explore the potential of a network to suppress biases due to the detectors' different locations and orientations. We find that location generally has a smaller effect than orientation, and becomes significant only when the time separation between signals is below sub-seconds. Through a population-level simulation over the extrinsic parameters, we find that nearly half of overlapping signals will lead to larger biases in the network compared to a single detector, highlighting the need to cope with overlapping biases in a detector network.",

We analyze the Newtonian limit and assess the impact of relativistic corrections, such as the gravitational redshifting of microscopic relaxation timescales. We show that bulk viscosity can significantly affect the behavior of both hydrodynamic and nonhydrodynamic fundamental modes, and that, depending on the magnitude of the viscous effects, it is the nonhydrodynamic mode that becomes unstable beyond the turning point in a sequence of equilibrium configurations.

We show that the metric corrections compared to the classical Schwarzschild solutions only depend on a single new parameter, corresponding to a minimal radius where a black hole-white hole transition occurs. While these corrections substantially alter the structure of the spacetime near this minimal radius, they fall off rapidly towards infinity, and we show in various examples how physical properties of the exterior spacetime are very close to those of the Schwarzschild solution. We derive the maximal analytic extension of the initial solution, which corresponds to an infinite sequence of Kruskal spacetimes connected via black-to-white hole transitions, and compare with some other proposals for non-singular black hole metrics. The metric violates the achronal averaged null energy condition, which indicates that we are capturing physics beyond the semiclassical approximation. Finally, we include some thoughts on how to go beyond the simple eternal black hole-white hole model presented here.",

We aim to search for the effects which could be associated with this scale and only find that the topological Gauss-Bonnet invariant swaps sign, and the value of the Keplerian frequency for circular geodesics becomes singular. At the same time, the geometric invariants of the curvature tensor have extremal values at the scale twice less than that of the throat, revealing new physical effects. In particular, the Ricci scalar at \\textit{r=M/2} (rather than \\textit{r=M}) is associated with the extremal values of thermodynamic characteristics of the scalar background.

Accepted in Physical Review D General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Next-generation GW detectors will produce a high rate of temporally overlapping signals from unrelated compact binary coalescences. Such overlaps can bias parameter estimation (PE) and mimic signatures of other physical effects, such as gravitational lensing. In this work, we investigate how overlapping signals can be degenerate with gravitational lensing by focusing on two scenarios: Type-II strong lensing and microlensing by an isolated point-mass lens. We simulate quasicircular binary black-hole pairs with chirp-mass ratios $\\mathscr{M}_{\\rm B}/\\mathscr{M}_{\\rm A}\\in\\{0.5,\\,1,\\,2\\}$, SNR ratios $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\rm B}/\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\rm A}\\in\\{0.5,\\,1\\}$, and coalescence-time offsets $\\Delta t_{\\rm c}\\in[-0.1,\\,0.1]~\\mathrm{s}$. Bayesian PE and fitting-factor studies show that the Type-II lensing hypothesis is favored over the unlensed quasicircular hypothesis ($\\log_{10}\\mathscr{B}^{\\rm L}_{\\rm U}>1$) only in a small region of the overlapping parameter space with $\\mathscr{M}_{\\rm B}/\\mathscr{M}_{\\rm A}\\gtrsim1$ and $|\\Delta t_{\\rm c}|\\leq0.03~\\rm{s}$.. Meanwhile, false evidence for microlensing signatures can arise because, to a reasonable approximation, the model produces two superimposed images whose time delay can closely match $|\\Delta t_{\\rm c}|$. Overall, the inferred Bayes factor depends on relative chirp-mass ratios, relative loudness, difference in coalescence times, and also the absolute SNRs of the overlapping signals. Cumulatively, our results indicate that overlapping black-hole binaries with nearly equal chirp masses and comparable loudness are likely to be falsely identified as lensed. Such misidentifications are expected to become more common as detector sensitivities improve. While our study focuses on ground-based detectors using appropriate detectability thresholds, the findings naturally extend to next-generation GW observatories.",

This statistical mechanics theory is associated with the GfE Lagrangian given by the Geometric Quantum Relative Entropy (GQRE) between the true metric and the metric induced by the matter fields and the curvature. The GfE action leads to the GfE modified gravity equations displaying an emergent dynamical cosmological constant. Interestingly, the GfE equations of motion reduce to the Einstein equations in the limit of low energy and small curvature. Here we embrace a thermodynamic point of view and we associate the energy density of the GfE to the emergent dynamical cosmological constant of the theory. Focusing on homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes, we reveal that the GfE universes associated with the FRW metrics are thermal. Indeed they are associated with the $k$-temperatures and the $k$-pressures which are related to their local GQRE and their local energy by the first law of GfE thermodynamics. The thermodynamics of the GfE theory is illustrated in the low energy, small curvature limit with matter content modelled as perfect fluid, where the solutions of the GfE equations of motion are well approximated by the Friedmann universes. We show that while the total GQRE per unit volume is not increasing, coherently with its relative entropy nature, the total entropy of GfE universes is not decreasing in time. These results provide a natural thermodynamic interpretation of GfE cosmologies and a framework for reconciling local complexity with the global increase in entropy of the universe.",

By constructing the phase space and canonical energy, we show that the dynamic stability for perturbations, restricted in symplectic complement of trivial perturbations with the ADM 3-momentum unchanged, is equivalent to the non-negativity of the canonical energy. Furthermore, dynamic stability against restricted axisymmetric perturbations guarantees the dynamic stability against all axisymmetric perturbations. We also prove that the positivity of canonical energy on all axisymmetric perturbations within the Lagrangian displacement framework with fixed angular momentum is necessary for thermodynamic stability. In particular, the equivalence of dynamic and thermodynamic stability for spherically symmetric perturbations of static, spherically symmetric isentropic configurations is established.",

We numerically construct a simple explicit example of an initial data set, with stronger asymptotics than have been obtained in previous work, such that the evolution of this initial data set does not exhibit the conjectured antipodal symmetry between future and past null infinity.",

Volovik 4 pages, no figures, comments are welcome General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other) The concept of gravitons and their masses, clear in the case of Minkowski spacetime, remains ambiguous for de Sitter spacetime. Here, we used a two-fluid approach to de Sitter thermodynamics and found a collective mode that is analogous to second sound in the two-fluid dynamics of the de Sitter state. This mode is massless and propagates at the speed of light. This suggests that this second-sound analog is a massless graviton propagating in de Sitter spacetime. The type of graviton this mode represents requires further consideration.",

For the neutral particle, when its spin magnitude surpasses a specific threshold, the value of the exponent exceeds the surface gravity, resulting in a violation. Given a fixed total angular momentum of the particle, its spin direction opposite to the angular momentum direction leads to a greater exponent value than when the two directions are aligned. For the charged particle, taking into account the influence of the electromagnetic force, we find that, for relatively large angular momenta, although the electromagnetic force does not change the trend of the exponent's variation with respect to spin and angular momentum and only modifies the specific values of the exponent, it still leads to violations of the bound. Therefore, the chaos bound is violated in the spinor field.",

This will include both individually resolvable signals and overlapping stochastic backgrounds, a regime intermediate between current ground-based detectors and pulsar timing arrays. The resolved sources and backgrounds will be fitted together in a high dimensional Global Fit. To extract information about the astrophysical populations to which the sources belong, we need to decode the information in the Global Fit, which requires new methodology that has not been required for the analysis of current gravitational wave detectors. Here, we %start that development, presenting present a hierarchical Bayesian framework to infer the properties of astrophysical populations directly from the output of a LISA Global Fit, consistently accounting for information encoded in both the resolved sources and the unresolved background. Using a simplified model of the Global Fit, we illustrate how the interplay between resolved and unresolved components affects population inference and highlight the impact of data analysis choices, such as the signal-to-noise threshold for resolved sources, on the results. Our approach provides a practical foundation for population inference using LISA data.",

Hujeirat, Paulsamy Muruganandam 7 pages, 6 figures, Supplemental Material included with source Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Neutron star glitches -- sudden increases in rotational frequency -- are thought to result from angular momentum transfer via quantized vortices in the superfluid core. To investigate the underlying superfluid dynamics, we employ a two-dimensional rotating atomic Bose-Einstein condensate described by a damped Gross-Pitaevskii equation with an imposed pinning potential that serves as a simplified analogue of a crust. Within this minimal framework, we examine the emergence and evolution of turbulent vortex motion following impulsive perturbations reminiscent of glitch-like forcing. Our simulations reveal a transient Kolmogorov-like turbulent cascade ($k^{-5/3}$) that transitions to a Vinen-like scaling ($k^{-1}$). We identify an anomalous secondary injection mechanism driven primarily by quantum pressure, which can sustain turbulent fluctuations in such a system. By tuning the damping coefficient $\\gamma$, we determine an optimal regime for energy transfer. While idealized, these findings illustrate how quantum turbulence with multiple scaling regimes can arise in pinned, rotating superfluids, and they suggest possible qualitative connections to vortex-mediated dynamics in neutron stars and other astrophysical superfluid systems.",
