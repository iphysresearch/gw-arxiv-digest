Soc. 544(2), 2172-2179 (Dec 2025) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We compute the achromatic gravitational imprint that Kerr spacetime leaves on linear polarization at the photon ring. Recasting parallel transport in a null Frenet--Serret frame yields a single scalar evolution law for the electric-vector position angle. On the observer's screen, the Kerr-minus-Schwarzschild pattern on the direct critical curve is nonzero, strictly odd under spin reversal after a half-turn azimuth relabelling, and tightly confined to a thin annulus. Using backward-shot, Carter-separated geodesics with midpoint RK2 transport, we achieve second-order convergence and degree-scale amplitudes that grow monotonically with spin and inclination (RMS $\\simeq 0.5$--$2^\\circ$ for $a/M\\gtrsim 0.8$, $i\\gtrsim 60^\\circ$). Three independent constructions -- Frenet--Serret line integral, explicit Levi--Civita transport of the polarization vector, and the phase of the Walker--Penrose constant -- agree ray by ray. We then define a parity-odd ring estimator that is intrinsically achromatic after standard wavelength-squared regression, symmetry-protected against common even-parity systematics, and compressed into low azimuthal modes. This yields a minimal two-parameter template (spin and inclination) for mm/sub-mm polarimetry of horizon-scale rings in sources such as M87$^\\ast$ and Sgr~A$^\\ast$. The pipeline enables either a detection of the strong-field parallel-transport phase induced by frame dragging or informative upper limits.",

Both timelike and null geodesics are addressed, probing the effect of the hair parameter on orbital stability. Deviations from the Schwarzschild solution have a significant influence on orbit stability, potentially providing observational signatures.

Based on invited talks by N.E.M. at the Corfu Summer Institute 2025 Workshops \"On the Standard Model and Beyond'' (Aug 24 - Sep 03, 2025), and \"Tensions in Cosmology'' (Sep 02 - Sep 08, 2025) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We review a novel scenario for the emergence of spin-polarisation entangled squeezed graviton states from superradiant axionic clouds in the neighborhood of astrophysical rotating black holes (BHs). The entangled squeezed graviton states are produced by both, conventional General-Relativity (GR) type axion-gravity interactions, and gravitational Chern-Simons (gCS) anomalous terms coupled to axions, which are non-trivial in the presence of rotating BHs. The two kinds of terms have different-symmetry contributions to the entangled squeezed states. The squeezing parameter is estimated in a weak-quantum-gravity framework. Some phenomenology with respect to current and future interferometric detection devices is discussed. Importantly, current data from LIGO/Virgo Experiments can impose upper-bound constraints on the value of the squeezing parameter and, thus, on the lifetime of the axionic clouds. In addition to the above rather direct-detection possibility of squeezed gravitons, there is also the possibility of indirect detection of quantum gravitons in Cosmology, given that chiral quantum gravitational-wave (GW) perturbations in the primordial Universe may imply condensation of gCS terms. This, in turn, leads to inflation of running vacuum type, with in principle observable patterns in the profile of the GW produced during the post-inflationary early radiation era, as well as the potential of alleviating cosmic tensions in the current era.",

Maity, Souvik Jana, Tejaswi Venumadhav, Ankur Barsode, Parameswaran Ajith General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) A small fraction of gravitational-wave (GW) signals from binary black holes (BBHs) will be gravitationally lensed by intervening galaxies and galaxy clusters. Strong lensing will produce multiple identical copies of the GW signal arriving at different times. Jana et al.~\\cite{Jana_2023} recently proposed a method to constrain cosmological parameters using strongly lensed GW events detected by next-generation (XG) detectors. The idea is that the number of strongly lensed GW events and the distribution of their lensing time delays encode imprints of the cosmological parameters. From the observed number of lensed GW events (tens of thousands) and their time delay distribution, this method can provide a new probe of cosmology, obtaining information at intermediate redshifts. In this work, we explore the possibility of doing lensing cosmography using upcoming observations of the upgraded LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network. This requires incorporating the detector network selection effects in the analysis, which was neglected earlier. We expect dozens of lensed GW events to be detected by upgraded LVK detectors, potentially enabling modest constraints on cosmological parameters. Even with relatively modest numbers of lensed detections, we demonstrate the potential of lensing cosmography. For XG detectors, our revised forecasts are consistent with with the earlier forecasts that neglected the selection effects.",

Such continuous waves, which have not been detected yet, will be very useful to study gravitational physics and to probe the extreme physics of neutron stars. While typically such waves from a pulsar are estimated considering an overall stellar ellipticity, there can be multiple irregularities or mountains in the stellar crust that the gravity of the star cannot smooth. In this paper, we consider this realistic situation and compute the strain, power, torque and the pulsar spin-down rate due to multiple mountains supported by the stellar crust. Here, we consider astronomically motivated mountain distributions and use the Brans-Dicke theory of gravity which has three polarization states: two tensors dominated by the time-varying quadrupole moment and one scalar dominated by the time-varying dipole moment. We also give the limiting results for general relativity.",

As such, it offers a theoretical playground to build fundamentally motivated extension to general relativity. The dynamical degrees of freedom include a ${\\rm GL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$ gauge connection and two independent tetrads. The theory allows for interaction terms between the two tetrads, whose structure displays some similarities with ghost-free bigravity. The extra gravitational degrees of freedom survive in the commutative limit. We show the effective action obtained in this limit, discuss its symmetries, and compare it with other bigravity theories. The dynamics of homogeneous and isotropic cosmological solutions split into two branches. One is characterized by a constant and purely spatial curvature two-form. The other displays a richer gauge freedom, and the Hamiltonian analysis of the dynamics reveals three extra first-class constraints in addition to the generator of time reparametrizations.",

The mass curve $M(|\\phi_c|)$ along these sequences develops multiple extrema, yet stability changes only at the first maximum; configurations beyond it become highly compact and collapse under numerically induced perturbations, with near-critical models displaying a short-lived double-dive behaviour. Head-on collisions of equal-mass stars yield three distinct outcomes - boson star remnants, black hole formation at contact, and collapse of each star to a black hole prior to contact. The associated gravitational-wave energies reflect the competition between increasing compactness and decreasing tidal deformability, and at large self-interaction strengths the collapse-before-contact branch exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic structure. The simulations reported here constitute a substantial catalogue of initial conditions and waveforms, providing a natural basis for neural-network techniques aimed at improving boson star initial data and constructing surrogate models capable of rapidly predicting gravitational-wave signals across an extended parameter space.",

Lobo General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph) We incorporate non-local gravitational self-energy, motivated by string-inspired T-duality, into the Schrödinger-Newton equation. In this framework spacetime has an intrinsic non-locality, rendering the standard linear superposition principle only an approximation valid in the absence of gravitational effects. We then invert the logic by assuming the validity of linear superposition and demonstrate that such superpositions inevitably become unstable once gravity is included. The resulting wave-function collapse arises from a fundamental tension between the equivalence principle and the quantum superposition principle in a semiclassical spacetime background. We further show that wave functions computed in inertial and freely falling frames differ by a gravitationally induced phase shift containing linear and cubic time contributions along with a constant global term. These corrections produce a global phase change and lead to a spontaneous, model-independent collapse time inversely proportional to the mass of the system.",

Starting from the renormalized energy-momentum tensor, we generalize the Stefan-Boltzmann law to include gravitational redshift and curvature corrections governed by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) metric. Finite temperature and spatial compactification are introduced simultaneously, allowing a unified and consistent treatment of both vacuum and thermal contributions inside and outside the star. Analytical expressions are derived for the high- and low-temperature limits, showing explicitly how curvature and redshift modify the characteristic $T^4$ dependence of thermal radiation. The results reveal that strong gravity significantly alters the local energy density and pressure, demonstrating the nontrivial interplay between quantum vacuum fluctuations and compact astrophysical geometries. A polytropic model is considered to perform numerical analyses, highlighting the influence of the spacetime background on vacuum fluctuations.",

For spin periods lower than 2 ms we constrain the ellipticity to be smaller than $4\\times 10^{-7}$ for all targets. We exclude the crustal anisotropy to be smaller than $5\\times 10^{-3}$ for spin periods between 1.3-100 ms. Only one candidate -- from the low frequency G347.3 search -- survives all follow-ups.

It enables us to manipulate single modes in nonlinear interactions with precision at the quantum level without involved setups. This setting is useful in the field of analogue gravity (AG), where gravitational phenomena are investigated in accessible analogue lab setups. These lecture notes provide an account of this AG framework and applications. Although light in nonlinear dielectrics is discussed in textbooks, the involved modelling often includes many assumptions that are directed at optical communications, some of which are rarely detailed. Here, we provide a self-contained and sufficiently detailed description of the propagation of light in fibers, with a minimal set of assumptions, which is relevant in the context of AG. Starting with the structure of a step-index fiber, we derive linear-optics propagating modes and show that the transverse electric field of the fundamental mode is well approximated as linearly polarized and of a Gaussian profile. We then incorporate a cubic nonlinearity and derive a general wave envelope propagation equation. With further simplifying assumptions, we arrive at the famous nonlinear Schrödinger equation, which governs fundamental effects in nonlinear fibers, such as solitons. As a first application in AG, we show how intense light in the medium creates an effective background spacetime for probe light akin to the propagation of a scalar field in a black hole spacetime. We introduce optical horizons and particle production in this effective spacetime, giving rise to the optical Hawking effect. Furthermore, we discuss two related light emission mechanisms. Finally, we present a second optical analogue model for the oscillations of black holes, the quasinormal modes, which are important in the program of black hole spectroscopy.",

The usual association of gravitational waves with transverse and traceless fluctuations of the metric on spatial hypersurfaces becomes ambiguous at second order, as it inherently depends on the spacetime slicing. While this poses no practical issues in linearized gravity, it presents a fundamental problem for secondary gravitational waves, especially notorious for gravitational waves induced by primordial fluctuations. We compute, for the first time, the physical effects of gravitational waves at second order, as measured by geodesic observers that emit and receive electromagnetic signals, thereby settling the debate on gauge ambiguities. We find that the measured gravitational wave strain coincides with the transverse-traceless components in the Newton gauge.",

Eric Yang Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Intrinsically topologically ordered phases can host anyons. Here, we take the view that entanglement between anyons can give rise to an emergent geometry resembling Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. We analyze the entanglement structure of fractionalized anyons using mutual information and interpret the results within this emergent geometric framework. As a concrete example, we consider pairs of $e/2$-charged semions that arise from instanton configurations in a disordered zigzag graphene nanoribbon. These fractional charges, located on opposite zigzag edges, show long-range quantum entanglement despite being spatially separated. We analyze the scale dependence of their entanglement and embed the ribbon into an AdS-like bulk geometry. In this setup, the entanglement structure defines minimal surfaces in the bulk, providing a geometric view of the edge correlations. This gives a holographic picture of fractionalized degrees of freedom in quasi-one-dimensional systems and shows how quantum entanglement can generate emergent geometry even without conformal symmetry.",

Coordinate systems of this kind are well suited for the study of the temporal evolution of matter and radiation fields in the joined exterior and interior regions of the Schwarzschild black hole geometry, whereas the associated foliations can be employed as initial data sets for the globally hyperbolic development under the Einstein flow. For their construction, we formulate an explicit method that utilizes the geometry of - and structures inherent in - the Penrose diagram of the Schwarzschild black hole geometry, thus relying on the corresponding metrical product structure. As an example, we consider an integrated algebraic sigmoid function as the basis for the determination of such a coordinate system. Finally, we generalize our results to the Reissner-Nordström black hole geometry up to the Cauchy horizon. The geometric construction procedure presented here can be adapted to yield similar coordinate systems for various other spacetimes with the same metrical product structure.",

Freire Corrections to the title and references in accordance with the published version General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th) Neutron stars (NSs) are compact objects that host the densest forms of matter in the observable universe, providing unique opportunities to study the behaviour of matter at extreme densities. While precision measurements of NS masses through pulsar timing have imposed effective constraints on the equation of state (EoS) of dense matter, accurately determining the radius or moment of inertia (MoI) of a NS remains a major challenge. This article presents a detailed review on measuring the Lense-Thirring (LT) precession effect in the orbit of binary pulsars, which would give access to the MoI of NSs and offer further constraints on the EoS. We discuss the suitability of certain classes of binary pulsars for measuring the LT precession from the perspective of binary star evolution, and highlight five pulsars that exhibit properties promising to realise these goals in the near future. Finally, discoveries of compact binaries with shorter orbital periods hold the potential to greatly enhance measurements of the MoI of NSs. The MoI measurements of binary pulsars are pivotal to advancing our understanding of matter at supranuclear densities as well as improving the precision of gravity tests, such as the orbital decay due to gravitational wave emission and of tests of alternative gravity theories.",

In theories with the Lagrangian $\\tilde{\\cal L}(F)+K(\\phi, X)$, which correspond to nonlinear electrodynamics with a k-essence scalar field, angular Laplacian instabilities induced by vector-field perturbations exclude all the regular spherically symmetric solutions including nonsingular black holes. In theories described by the Lagrangian ${\\cal L}=X+\\mu(\\phi)F^n$, where $\\mu$ is a function of $\\phi$ and $n$ is a constant, the absence of angular Laplacian instabilities of spherically symmetric objects requires that $n>1/2$, under which nonsingular black holes with apparent horizons are not present. However, for some particular ranges of $n$, there are horizonless compact objects with neither ghosts nor Laplacian instabilities in the small-scale limit. In theories given by ${\\cal L}=X \\kappa (F)$, where $\\kappa$ is a function of $F$, regular spherically symmetric objects are prone to Laplacian instabilities either around the center or at spatial infinity.

In our work we first show that this equivalence between the oscillating scalar field model and the CDM sector is exact only in a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime in the absence of cosmological constant and any other possible matter components in the universe when the mass of the scalar field is very large compared to the Hubble parameter. Then we show how to generalize the equivalence between the coherently oscillating scalar field model and the CDM sector in a spatially curved universe with multiple matter components. Using our general method, we will show how a coherently oscillating scalar field model can represent the CDM sector in the presence of non-minimal coupling of the CDM sector with radiation. Our method is powerful enough to work out the dynamics of gravitational collapse in a closed FLRW spacetime where the coherently oscillating scalar field model represents the CDM sector. We have, for the first time, presented a consistent method which specifies how a coherently oscillating scalar field model, where the scalar field is ultralight, acts like the CDM sector in a multicomponent universe.",

D 112, 125018 (2025) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph) This article investigates quantum entanglement generated within a one-dimensional cavity where one boundary undergoes prescribed acceleration, a setup designed to mimic aspects of Hawking radiation. We quantify quantum correlations using logarithmic negativity for bipartitions where subsystem $A$ is a given mode and subsystem $B$ is the rest of the system. For initial pure states, we also consider a given mode and reconstruct its partner using the Hotta-Schützhold-Unruh formula, obtaining identical results. Interestingly, this last method offers notable computational efficiency. However, partner modes do not commute, due to the nontrivial multimode entanglement structure. Hence, a pairwise description will not be suitable for describing the full system. Besides, our findings reveal that the expanding cavity effectively acts as a squeezing device, with Hawking-partner pairs largely behaving as two-mode squeezed states. We checked that, in our setting, purification of Hawking modes is predominantly a low-energy process, with high-energetic particles contributing negligibly to the partner modes. Indeed, in both small and large acceleration regimes of the boundaries, quantum entanglement decreases toward the ultraviolet modes, indicating that higher-energy particles are more challenging to entangle and hence less probable to contribute in the purification process. Besides the initial vacuum state, we also consider one-mode squeezed and two-mode squeezed states, in order to confirm if quantum entanglement can be stimulated. Moreover, we analyze its robustness against initial thermal noise. Our analysis is based on numerical simulations and does not assume any approximation beyond the validity of our numerical algorithms. We conclude with a discussion about the possible implementation and observation of our results in the laboratory.",

These are weak signals from rapidly spinning neutron stars that remain undetected despite extensive searches. The competition dataset consisted of a population of CW signals using both simulated and real LIGO detector data matching the conditions of actual CW searches. The competition attracted more than 1,000 participants to develop realistic CW search algorithms. We describe the top 10 approaches and discuss their applicability as a pre-processing step compared to standard CW-search approaches. For the competition's dataset, we find that top approaches can reduce the computing cost by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude at a false-dismissal probability comparable to standard CW searches. Additionally, the competition drove the development of new GPU-accelerated detection pipelines, which facilitated their adoption in other areas of gravitational-wave data analysis. We release the associated dataset, which constitutes the first open standardized benchmark for CW detection, to enable reproducible method comparisons and to encourage further developments toward the first detection of these elusive signals.",

We derive expressions for photon sphere radii and horizons for this metric in terms of the conformal gravity parameters, from which we then determine analytic formulae for extremal limits and Hawking temperatures. Due to the surprising lack of the inverse quadratic $1/r^2$ term in this fourth-order metric, there is no guarantee for the innermost horizon of a black hole spacetime to be a Cauchy horizon, which is in direct contrast to the corresponding metric in general relativity. For example, for certain parameter values, a ``nested black hole'' is seen to exist; in such a spacetime, we find a Cauchy horizon trapped between two event horizons, which is not a structure known to be obtainable in standard general relativity. In addition to such exotic spacetimes, we also find a critical value for the electric and magnetic charges, at which the stable and unstable photon spheres of the metric merge, and we obtain extremal limits where three horizons collide.",

Our results show that the Brans-Dicke-Kerr spacetime with the parameter $\\omega>-3/2$ represents naked singularities with distinct structures.

For the case with $a > M$, a distinct gray region consisting of two separate patches appears in the image observed by equatorial observers. This indicating that the Brans-Dicke-Kerr spacetime can be distinguished from the Kerr and Kerr-de Sitter cases based on its image.

      "abstract": "v2: clarified thermodynamic framework, added horizon-coupled continuity analysis, improved CMB and baryon balance discussion, and helium fraction discussion General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We develop a mesoscopic framework in which the cosmological exterior is treated as an open quantum subsystem coupled to horizon degrees of freedom. Although local conservation laws satisfy $\\nabla_\\mu\\langle J^\\mu\\rangle=0$, transport of baryon number across horizons removes conserved charges from the observer--accessible sector, producing effective depletion in exterior densities. Global unitarity therefore requires compensating source terms in the reduced exterior continuity equations. We show that relativistic causality forces this compensation to occur through long--wavelength geometric excitations: only infrared modes can restore entropy and charge while remaining outside the causal wedge of the infalling matter. An infrared return channel thus emerges as a generic feature of horizon--coupled semiclassical gravity. The second ingredient is a Carnot--Carathéodory (CC) tangent geometry, whose mesoscopic scale $\\sigma$ governs both infrared mode excitation and the kinematics of photon and matter propagation. In this setting, photon trajectories follow recurrent horizontal geodesics, producing an effective cosmic cavity whose stationary state is a Planck spectrum characterized by $\\sigma$. The same scale modifies large--radius circular motion in a manner consistent with flattened galactic rotation curves. Horizon thermodynamics and mesoscopic balance laws then link $\\sigma$ to the cosmic expansion rate, yielding $H\\sim\\sigma$ and a unified infrared structure underlying photon equilibrium, baryon balance, and large--scale kinematics.",

      "abstract": "A cyclic scale-invariance universe with negative variable cosmological constant Nasr Ahmed General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The AdS vacuum corresponds to a negative cosmological constant $\\Lambda$. While it is well-motivated theoretically, There has always been controversy over its actual existence. The AdS-dS transition is corresponding to a sign switching $\\Lambda$. We have proposed an ansatz for a negative time-varying cosmological constant $\\Lambda(H)$ as a function of Hubble parameter $H$, and used it in constructing a periodic model with no future singularity in a scale-invariance gravity. With the proposed Ansatz for negative $\\Lambda$, The model leads to a physically acceptable cosmic description, while we get unphysical parameters with the positive and zero values of $\\Lambda$. The model reveals a Quintom behavior with a sign flipping of cosmic pressure during each period. The non-conventional mechanism of negative $\\Lambda$ that are expected to address the late-time acceleration has been revisited.",

Revised version History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph) We argue that special and general theories of relativity implicitly assume spacetime events correspond to quantum measurement outcomes. This leads to a change in how one should view the equivalence of spacetime and gravity. We describe a Bell test using time-like measurements that indicates a non classical causal structure that does not violate no-signaling. From this perspective, the violation of the Bell inequalities are already evidence for the non classical structure of flat spacetime as seen by an agent embedded in it. We argue that spacetime geometry can be learned by an embedded agent with internal actuators and sensors making internal measurements.",
