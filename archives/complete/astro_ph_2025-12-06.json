      "abstract": "Cosmology after Phantom Crossing by Horndeski Gravity Eric V. Linder Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) One possible way to explain the observed effective dark energy equation of state crossing $w=-1$ (the phantom divide) is through modified gravity. A key point is to not view the expansion history in isolation but to take into account the other gravitational impacts on growth of large scale structure, lensing, etc. Within shift symmetric Horndeski gravity this implies three main paths for the late time cosmic expansion. All require unusual kinetic structure and we analyze their various implications for how $w$ should behave after phantom crossing.",

The much debated problems of the redshift and the photon propagation in a gravitational field is then considered and applied to the calculation of the speed of light. Many citations are given in direct quotations to avoid any misunderstandings. If the quotations are in German, an English translation is provided. Based on this speed, calculated and measured results are recalled on the deflection of light, with emphasis on the deflection near the Sun. We conclude that the speed of light and the deflection angle can be determined by energy and momentum conservation principles.",

Companion paper to arXiv:2504.13251 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) How is the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) in single-field models of inflation impacted by the presence of additional scalar fields? We consider the effect of a spectator field - a free scalar field with sub-Hubble mass, no direct coupling to the inflaton, and which makes a subdominant contribution to the total energy density - in the context of single-field models of inflation featuring a transient phase of ultra-slow roll (USR) evolution. Despite the modest title, a spectator field can have a dramatic impact: the slow-roll evolution of the spectator prevents the combined inflaton-and-spectator system from entering into USR, which naively might be expected to preclude the production of PBHs. However, we demonstrate that the growth of perturbations is maintained or enhanced by the spectator, through the rich interplay of curvature and isocurvature perturbations. We show in a model-independent way that the single-field phase of ultra-slow-roll is replaced by two turns in field space encompassing a phase of tachyonic instability for the isocurvature perturbations and a transfer of power from isocurvature to curvature modes. Furthermore, we highlight a degeneracy between the fine-tuning of the feature in the inflaton potential and the parameters of the spectator, leading to an overall resilience of model predictions to parameter variations. This makes it easier for the underlying PBH model to accommodate both high-precision CMB constraints and production of PBHs in the asteroid-mass range.",

If ultra-light RPBHs dominated the early Universe, the initial isocurvature perturbation is converted into curvature perturbation that induce second-order GW background upon evaporation of RPBHs. The upper limit of extra relativistic degrees of freedom $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$, which could be inferred from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis or Cosmic Microwave Background observations, places a constraint on the maximum energy density of GW, which in turn can be used to constrain the RPBH population. As RPBHs have different lifetime from their singular counterparts, the constraint must be modified accordingly. While the formalism that we provide is generic, we work out explicitly the case of Simpson-Visser metric for demonstration. The RPBHs associated with this metric have lower Hawking temperature and smaller horizon size, leading to a longer lifetime than the singular Schwarzschild black holes. This implies a stronger constraint on RPBH population as they dominate the Universe for a longer period of time and generate stronger GW.",

From detailed numerical simulations we find that the bubbles are generically surrounded by type-II curvature fluctuations. Special attention is given to the distribution of initial conditions, including the relevant mean profiles and shape dispersion around them. For the adiabatic channel, we extend the logarithmic template formula $\\zeta[\\zeta_G]$, which maps the Gaussian curvature perturbation to the fully non-Gaussian one while incorporating mode evolution, and we compare this with numerical results obtained using the $\\delta N$ formalism. While the template departs from numerical results near its logarithmic divergence, it still provides accurate threshold values for PBH formation in the parameter range relevant to our analysis. Finally, we compute the PBH mass functions for both channels. We find that the adiabatic channel dominates over the bubble-induced channel by a factor $\\sim \\mathcal{O}(10-10^{2})$, and that both contributions are largely dominated by the mean profiles.",

Applying a density-based member selection (\\texttt{dbscan}) to data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we identify its virialised core and zero-velocity boundary. Cross-correlating with the Cosmicflows-4 (CF4) catalogue enables a velocity-distance analysis, incorporating radial infall models and redshift-independent distance estimators. This reveals, for the first time, the Hubble flow surrounding Coma, a first step to investigate the entanglement between Coma's dark matter halo and the dark energy driving the expansion of the surroundings. The distance to the Coma centre is determined as $(69.959 \\pm 0.012) \\, h^{-1}~\\text{Mpc}$. From \\texttt{dbscan}, we infer a virial radius of $r_{\\rm vir} = \\left(1.95 \\pm 0.12\\right)\\,h^{-1}~\\text{Mpc}$ and a turnaround of $r_{\\rm ta} \\geq 4.87~{h}^{-1}~\\mbox{Mpc}$. Combining the SDSS redshifts with the CF4 distances, we estimate the Hubble constant to be $H_0 = (73.10 \\pm 0.92)~\\mbox{km}/\\mbox{s}/\\mbox{Mpc}$, which varies between $[72, 80]$~km/s/Mpc with different calibrations for the distance moduli. Mass estimates via caustics, the virial theorem and the Hubble-flow method yield $M = [0.77, 2.0] \\times 10^{15}\\,h^{-1}\\,M_{\\odot}$, consistent with prior mass estimates. However, our mass estimates are based on fewer model assumptions in the member selection and require fewer members to attain the same precision. Our systematic approach maps the structure of Coma into the local Hubble flow and shows the degeneracies between dynamical parameters such as the Hubble constant, the virial radius, and the total mass.",

Ilya Mandel updated version, as accepted for publication in Astrophysical Journal Letters High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In the presence of significant measurement uncertainties, the events which appear to be the most extreme are very likely to be those exhibiting the greatest statistical fluctuations. It is therefore particularly important to exercise care when interpreting such events and to use the entire observed population for context. Here, I attempt to pedagogically illustrate this using the example of the most massive binary black hole so far detected in gravitational-wave data, GW231123. I argue that its total mass may be significantly lower than $238^{+28}_{-49}$ solar masses as reported by Abac et al. (2025a). The maximum total binary black hole mass from an analysis of the entire detected population is below 170 solar masses if the same priors that are used for individual event analyses in the GWTC catalogs, including for the analysis of GW231123, are applied to the population as a whole. However, this value is very sensitive to assumptions about the population distribution.",

      "abstract": "Controlled Tension Forecasting: Quantifying Cross-Probe Biases in $ω_0ω_a$CDM Seokcheon Lee Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Recent analyses combining DESI DR2 BAO, Planck CMB, and Pantheon+ SNe have reported mild but intriguing deviations from the LambdaCDM model. A central challenge is to determine whether these deviations reflect genuine dynamical dark energy behavior or instead arise from cross-probe inconsistencies, prior choices, or mismatches in likelihood construction. Previous work demonstrated that imposing a biased supernova-motivated prior on Omega_{m0} can artificially displace the BAO-inferred w_0,w_a values from the LambdaCDM expectation. A complementary pedagogic study further showed that the differing degeneracy geometries of BAO, CMB, and SNe can generate apparent dark energy evolution even when the underlying cosmology is exactly LambdaCDM. In this manuscript, we develop a controlled tension injection framework that provides a systematic means of quantifying how probe-level tensions influence inferred dark energy parameters. Self-consistent BAO, CMB, and SNe mock datasets are augmented with parameterized shifts in (Omega_{m0}, H_0), supernova absolute calibration, and the BAO sound-horizon scale $r_d$. The resulting datasets are analyzed through a unified MCMC pipeline, enabling a direct assessment of how these controlled tensions propagate into biases in (w_0, w_a) and the pivot equation-of-state parameter w_p. This forecasting framework provides practical guidance for identifying probe combinations that are most susceptible to spurious signatures of dynamical dark energy, and helps ensure robust multi-probe inference in forthcoming precision surveys.",

By implementing prompt cusps in the Galacticus galaxy formation model, we show that the measured velocity dispersions of Tucana V and Triangulum II are serious outliers for dwarf galaxies arising in WDM models.

McGee Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Feedback from active supermassive black holes alters the distribution of matter in the Universe by injecting energy in the neighbouring hot gaseous medium, which leads to ejection of gas from the halos of galaxy groups and massive galaxies. Recent cosmological simulations such as FLAMINGO calibrate their feedback model on the baryon fractions of galaxy groups to tune the efficiency of gas ejection. However, recent observational constraints from optically selected groups and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect yield lower baryon fractions than previous studies, which indicates that feedback may be more ejective than previously thought. Here we show that models involving highly ejective feedback are inconsistent with the scaling relations of local galaxy groups in the mass range $10^{13}-10^{14}M_\\odot$. We study the X-ray luminosity-temperature relation in a sample of 44 galaxy groups with high-quality XMM-Newton observations. We show that highly ejective models under-predict the luminosity of galaxy groups at fixed mass at high significance ($5.7\\sigma$). This conclusion is robust against selection effects and is obtained from directly measurable and minimally correlated quantities. We point out that turning observable quantities into gas fraction estimates is challenging, especially in the context of stacking large samples of heterogeneous systems. We argue that calibrating feedback models on baryon fractions is prone to systematic uncertainties and that observable scaling relations are better suited for this task.",

By calibrating these effects using external data, we recover non-linear information, achieving a 2% constraint on the clustering amplitude, $S_8$, resulting in a factor of two improvement on the $\\Lambda$CDM constraints relative to the fiducial Dark Energy Survey Year 3 model. The posterior, $S_8=0.832^{+0.013}_{-0.017}$, shifts by $1.5\\sigma$ to higher values, in closer agreement with the cosmic microwave background result for the standard six-parameter $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

Philcox Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Models of cosmic inflation generically predict a weak but potentially detectable amount of primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), which can be used to obtain insights into the degrees of freedom during inflation and their interactions. The simplest types of PNG are the local and non-local (equilateral and orthogonal) shapes of the primordial three-point correlators, which are predicted by models with multiple light fields and derivative interactions in single-field inflation, respectively. In this paper we place constraints on local, equilateral, and orthogonal non-Gaussianities using the power spectrum and bispectrum extracted from first public release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our analysis makes use of higher-order clustering information through a consistent effective field theory (EFT) model for both the power spectrum and bispectrum at one-loop order. Using robust scale cuts where the EFT description is valid, we find the following constraints on PNG amplitudes: $f^{\\rm loc}_{\\rm NL}=-0.1\\pm 7.4$, $f^{\\rm equil}_{\\rm NL}=719\\pm 390$, $f^{\\rm orth}_{\\rm NL}=-200\\pm 100$ (at $68\\%$ CL). Non-local PNG constraints can be further improved by combining high-redshift DESI with legacy BOSS data and using simulation-based priors on bias parameters, yielding the strongest large-scale structure constraints to date $f^{\\rm equil}_{\\rm NL}=200\\pm 230$, $f^{\\rm orth}_{\\rm NL}=-24\\pm 86$. Our constraint on $f^{\\rm loc}_{\\rm NL}$ is competitive with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) limit; the combination gives $f^{\\rm loc}_{\\rm NL}=-0.0\\pm 4.1$, $18\\%$ stronger than the CMB only result, which represents the strongest bound on multi-field inflation yet obtained.",

The leading order shape distortion is shear, which, if measurable, will be a complementary cosmological probe to traditional cosmic shear. In Hogg et al. (2025a), we modelled 23 of the SLACS strong lenses, studying the line-of-sight (LOS) shear under a variety of shear and mass model parametrisations. In this work, we model 27 additional lenses, extending our sample of LOS shear constraints to 45 in total. We find a mean shear magnitude of $0.11\\pm 0.024$, showing that a significant fraction of the lenses modelled in this work possess LOS shears with unexpectedly large magnitudes, $|\\gamma_{\\rm LOS}| > 0.1$, even when an octupolar distortion is included in the lens mass. We further investigate if factors such as lens and source redshift, filter and PSF, or flux and signal-to-noise ratio in the lensed arcs correlate with shear. We find that none of these features play a statistically significant role in the production of unusually large shear magnitudes.",

Such interactions have been proposed to explain the unusually deep 21cm absorption signal reported by EDGES in 2018. This paper explores the potential to detect dark matter - baryon scattering with the Hongmeng project, an upcoming lunar orbiting satellite experiment dedicated to measuring global 21cm signal between redshifts $11-46$. We self-consistently forward-model the simulated sky temperature data, jointly varying both the astrophysical and foreground models. We show that even with a very conservative observational strategy in which the experiment only takes data when both the Earth and the Sun are shielded by the Moon, Hongmeng can tighten the current constraints on dark matter - baryon scattering cross-section $\\sigma_0$ by a factor of 21 after the full mission which lasts for five years. The prospective upper limit on $\\sigma_0$ can reach $4 \\times 10^{-43} {\\rm cm^2}$ for dark matter masses between 0.1 MeV and 0.4 GeV. Even after only one month of observation, a factor of 3 improvement relative to current $\\sigma_0$ limits can be expected.",

Ferreira Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present the spectrum of $n_s$ constraints from current CMB data (Planck, ACT, SPT-3G) combined with DESI BAO data, and highlight the interplay of $n_s$ with the optical depth to reionization $\\tau$. The spectral index $n_s$ of the primordial power spectrum provides a window into early universe, and constraints on $n_s$ play an important role in discriminating early universe models such as models of cosmic inflation. Historically constrained by cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments, the constraints on $n_s$ shift upward when CMB data is combined with the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Recent work explained the origin of this and the relation to the BAO-CMB tension between CMB experiments and DESI BAO, and as a case study presented constraints on $n_s$ from the combination of Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 data and DESI DR2 data. Here we present constraints from Planck (PR3 and PR4), ACT, the South Pole Telescope (SPT), and the combination of all three CMB experiments, CMB-SPA, with and without DESI DR2 BAO data, and with and without CMB lensing data. In all cases the constraint on $n_s$ is shifted upwards when DESI is included, with the largest shift exhibited by ACT. This is accompanied by a commensurate shift in the constraint on the optical depth to reionization $\\tau$, which is again greatest for ACT. When CMB data are combined into CMB-SPA and combined with DESI the $n_s$ constraint disfavors at more than $2\\sigma$ the inflation models preferred by Planck alone, such as Higgs, Starobinsky, and exponential $\\alpha$-attractors, in favor of other models, such as polynomial $\\alpha$-attractors. This work motivates the further study of the tension between CMB and DESI BAO data, and of the rich interplay between $n_s$ and $\\tau$.",

In this paper, we analyze how the uncertainty in the dark matter speed distribution near the Sun is affected by baryonic feedback, halo-to-halo variance, and halo mass. To do so, we harness the statistical power of the new DREAMS Cold Dark Matter simulation suite, which is comprised of 1024 zoom-in Milky Way-mass halos with varied initial conditions as well as cosmological and astrophysical parameters. Applying a normalizing flows emulator to these simulations, we find that the uncertainty in the local DM speed distribution is dominated by halo-to-halo variance and, to a lesser extent, uncertainty in host halo mass. Uncertainties in supernova and black hole feedback (from the IllustrisTNG model in this case) are negligible in comparison. Using the DREAMS suite, we present a state-of-the-art prediction for the DM speed distribution in the Milky Way. Although the Standard Halo Model is contained within the uncertainty of this prediction, individual galaxies may have distributions that differ from it. Lastly, we apply our DREAMS results to the XENON1T experiment and demonstrate that the astrophysical uncertainties are comparable to the experimental ones, solidifying previous results in the literature obtained with a smaller sample of simulated Milky Way-mass halos.",

Romanowsky, Grant Tremblay Submitted to ApJ Letters. The single most important new observation is the 600 km/s gradient in the position-velocity diagram, shown in Fig. 7. The discovery paper (van Dokkum et al. 2023) was right about the key interpretation but had quite a few of the details wrong. This is reviewed in section 6.5 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of a candidate runaway supermassive black hole at the tip of a 62 kpc-long linear feature at z=0.96. The JWST data show a sharp kinematic discontinuity at the tip, with a radial velocity change of $\\approx 600$ km/s across 0.1'' (1 kpc). The velocity gradient, together with the projected post-shock flow velocity of $\\approx 300$ km/s, is well described by a simple shock-compression model of a supersonic object, with a velocity of $v_{BH} = 954^{+110}_{-126}$ km/s and an inclination $i=29^{+6}_{-3}$ deg. The previously puzzling kinematics along the linear feature, with the observed radial velocity decreasing from $\\approx 300$ km/s near the tip to $\\approx 100$ km/s closer to the former host galaxy, are naturally explained as gradual downstream mixing of shocked gas with the circumgalactic medium through turbulent entrainment. The runaway black hole interpretation is further supported by the morphology of the gas at the tip of the wake and an analysis of the [OIII]/H$\\alpha$, [NII]/H$\\alpha$, [SII]/H$\\alpha$, and [SIII]/[SII] line ratios. The line ratios are consistent with fast radiative shocks and rapid cooling, with best-fit shock velocities that are in good agreement with expectations from the black hole velocity and the shock geometry. Energy conservation over the lifetime of the wake suggests a SMBH mass of $M_{BH} \\gtrsim 10^7$ M$_{\\odot}$. These results confirm that the wake is powered by a supersonic runaway supermassive black hole, a long-predicted consequence of gravitational-wave recoil or multi-body ejection from galactic nuclei.",

Crossett, Yasmin Cavalcante-Coelho 13 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables. Accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Recent observational studies suggest that the interplay between internal and environmental mechanisms, in particular, the combined action of stellar bars and ram pressure stripping (RPS) may influence central star formation activity in jellyfish galaxies. However, current evidence relies on small samples, leaving open whether bars play a significant role during stripping. In this study, we analyse a sample about five times larger than those used in previous works, comprising 176 galaxies identified as RPS candidates based on optical morphological indicators such as asymmetries, debris tails, and displaced star-forming regions. To assess the impact of these processes, we examine radial $u-r$ colour profiles from SDSS imaging as tracers of the specific star formation rate (sSFR). We classify galaxies by bar presence and RPS signatures, and construct comparison samples through stepwise matching in stellar mass and environment to disentangle the individual and combined effects of bars and RPS on stellar population gradients. Our results show that central rejuvenation signals emerge in RPS candidate galaxies, becoming most evident when bars and RPS act together. Barred RPS galaxies are systematically bluer at all radii than their non-RPS counterparts, while unbarred systems display only mild or no central differences, suggesting that the observable outcome of RPS depends on the stripping stage. Furthermore, barred galaxies exhibit flatter central colour profiles than unbarred ones -- a robust signature across all matched configurations. These findings highlight the key role of bars in amplifying environmental effects on the stellar populations of jellyfish galaxies, underscoring how internal structures can modulate the observable signatures of environmental processes in galaxies.",

This integrates intra-halo dynamics, halo exclusion, and quenching, bridging insights from hydrodynamical, HOD, abundance-matching, and semi-analytic studies. Leveraging full phase-space information from the Uchuu N-body simulation, and sampling satellites from dark-matter particle positions via physically motivated prescriptions, HOMe reproduces the anisotropic clustering down to $s=200\\,h^{-1}$kpc with unprecedented accuracy. Model parameters are inferred solely from two-point statistics using a two-level Bayesian framework, yielding high-fidelity ELG, LRG and cross-reference catalogs. We find that satellite ELGs behave as incoherent flows within their parent halos, dominating the clustering below $4\\,h^{-1}$Mpc. The HOD from the best-fit HOMe has the following properties: (i) 90.50% (85.91%) of ELGs (LRGs) are central galaxies without satellites, residing in halos of $M_{\\rm vir}\\sim6.6\\times10^{11}\\,(1.2\\times10^{13})\\,h^{-1}{\\rm M}_\\odot$; (ii) the ELG$\\times$LRG cross-correlation is governed by central-central pairs and shaped by halo exclusion on $2-5\\,h^{-1}$Mpc scales; (iii) 9.50% (14.09%) of ELGs (LRGs) are satellites, of which 1.09% (3.52%) inhabit halos with a central galaxy of the same species in a maximally conformal configuration, 7.02% (0.005%) orbit complementary hosts in a minimally conformal state, and 0.58% (10.57%) are orphans.

Such an accretion disk can produce unbound wind ejecta, with synthesized $^{56}\\mathrm{Ni}$ mixed in. Numerical simulations reveal that this unbound ejecta should be strongly polar-dominated, which may cause the following radioactive-powered thermal transient to be viewing-angle-dependent. This issue has so far received limited investigation. We investigate how the intrinsically non-spherical geometry of WD-NS wind ejecta affects the viewing-angle dependence of the thermal transients. Using a two-dimensional axisymmetric ejecta configuration and incorporating heating from the radioactive decay of $^{56}\\mathrm{Ni}$, we employ a semi-analytical discretization scheme to simulate the observed viewing-angle-dependent photospheric evolution, as well as the resulting spectra and lightcurves. The observed photosphere evolves over time and depends strongly on the viewing angle: off-axis observers can see deeper, hotter inner layers of the ejecta and larger projected photospheric areas compared to on-axis observers. For a fiducial WD-NS merger producing 0.3 solar mass of ejecta and 0.01 solar mass of synthesized $^{56}\\mathrm{Ni}$, the resulting peak optical absolute magnitudes of the transient span from ~ -12 mag along the polar direction to ~ -16 mag along the equatorial direction, corresponding to luminosities of $10^{40}$-$10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The typical peak timescales are expected to be 3-10 d. We for the first time explore the viewing-angle effect on WD-NS merger transients. Since their ejecta composition and energy sources resemble those of supernovae, yet WD-NS merger transients are dimmer and evolve more rapidly, we propose using \"mini-supernovae\" to describe the thermal emission following WD-NS mergers.",

Minor corrections Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) In this work, we study the previously unexplored resonant region of neutrino self-interactions. Current disagreement on late and early time observations of the Universe expansion could be solved with new physics acting before the recombination era. Nonstandard neutrino self-interactions are among the most appealing candidates to solve this issue since they could be testable in the near (or midterm) future. We use linear cosmological datasets to test neutrino self-interactions for a sample of fixed scalar mediator masses in the range $10^{-2}$ eV $\\leq m_{\\varphi}\\leq 10^{2}$ eV. The resonant behavior produces observable effects at lower couplings than those reported in the literature for heavy and light mediators. We observe that in the best case scenario, using the Planck + BAO dataset, the tension with local measurements of $H_0$ eases from 4.9$\\sigma$ (for $\\Lambda$CDM) down to 2.8$\\sigma$. Albeit, this is driven mainly by the addition of extra radiation, with $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}\\sim 0.5$.

Although, this last result is obtained with data that are still in tension. These results add the last piece in the parameter space of neutrino self-interactions at the linear perturbation regime.",

We model 23 strong gravitational lenses from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) catalogue with the aim of measuring the line-of-sight (LOS) shear for the first time. We use the 'minimal model' for the LOS shear, which has been shown to be theoretically safe from degeneracies with lens model parameters, a finding which has been confirmed using mock data. We use the dolphin automated modelling pipeline, which uses the lenstronomy software as a modelling engine, to model our selected lenses. Across the 23 lenses, we measure the LOS shear with a mean magnitude of $0.056 \\pm 0.013$. Neglecting the post-Born correction to the potential of the main deflector due to foreground shear leads to a propagation of degeneracies in the LOS shear measurement with other lens model parameters, and the inclusion of an octupole moment in the lens mass profile does not lead to shear measurements that are in better agreement with the expectations from weak lensing.",

Bautista, Dominique Fouchez, Lluís Galbany, Benjamin Racine, The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration The Astrophysical Journal, 994, (2025) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Measurement of the growth rate of structures ($\\fsig$) with Type Ia supernovae (\\sns) will improve our understanding of the nature of dark energy and enable tests of general relativity. In this paper, we generate simulations of the 10 year \\sn\\ dataset of the Rubin-LSST survey, including a correlated velocity field from a N-body simulation and realistic models of \\sns\\ properties and their correlations with host-galaxy properties. We find, similar to SN~Ia analyses that constrain the dark energy equation-of-state parameters $w_0w_a$, that constraints on $\\fsig$ can be biased depending on the intrinsic scatter of \\sns. While for the majority of intrinsic scatter models we recover $\\fsig$ with a precision of $\\sim13 - 14\\%$, for the most realistic dust-based model, we find that the presence of non-Gaussianities in Hubble diagram residuals leads to a bias on $\\fsig$ of about $\\sim-20\\%$. When trying to correct for the dust-based intrinsic scatter, we find that the propagation of the uncertainty on the model parameters does not significantly increase the error on $\\fsig$. We also find that while the main component of the error budget of $\\fsig$ is the statistical uncertainty ($>75\\%$ of the total error budget), the systematic error budget is dominated by the uncertainty on the damping parameter, $\\sigma_u$, that gives an empirical description of the effect of redshift space distortions on the velocity power spectrum. Our results motivate a search for new methods to correct for the non-Gaussian distribution of the Hubble diagram residuals, as well as an improved modeling of the damping parameter.",

Comments are welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Several models based on General Relativity and Modified Gravity aim to reproduce the observed universe with precision comparable to the flat-$\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. In this study, we investigate the consistency of some of these models with current high-redshift cosmic data, assessing their ability to simultaneously describe both the background expansion and matter clustering, using measurements of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$, the luminosity distance $D_L(z)$, and the growth rate of structures $[f\\sigma_8](z)$ through parametric and non-parametric methods. Our results indicate that background observables alone offer limited capacity to distinguish between models, while the inclusion of growth of structures data proves useful in revealing deviations, even if small. An $F(Q)$ model, the non-flat $\\Lambda$CDM and the $\\omega$CDM emerge as alternatives well supported by data, closely matching the growth data and showing performance comparable to $\\Lambda$CDM, as revealed by the Akaike Information Criterion. In contrast, $F(R)$ models are strongly disfavored compared to $\\Lambda$CDM and $F(Q)$. However, according to the Bayesian Information Criterion, $\\Lambda$CDM remains the preferred model among the models analysed. These analyses illustrate the usefulness of both parametric and non-parametric approaches to explore the observational viability of alternative cosmological models.",

The first emulator is built in terms of seven cosmological parameters: the matter and baryon fraction of the energy density of the Universe $\\Omega_m$ and $\\Omega_b$, the reduced Hubble constant $h$, the scalar spectral index $n_s$, the amplitude of matter density fluctuations $\\sigma_8$, the total neutrino mass $M_{\\nu}$ and the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$, on scales $k \\in [0.015,1.8]\\,h/ \\rm{Mpc^{-1}}$. The power spectra can be directly determined at redshifts 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3, while for intermediate redshifts these can be interpolated. The second emulator is based on five cosmological parameters, $\\Omega_m$, $h$, $n_s$, $\\sigma_8$ and the amplitude of equilateral non-Gaussianity $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm eq}$, at redshifts 0, 0.503, 0.733, 0.997 for $k \\in [0.015,1.8]\\,h/ \\rm{Mpc^{-1}}$. The emulators are built on machine learning techniques. In both cases we have investigated both neural networks and tree-based methods and we have shown that the best accuracy is obtained for a neural network with two hidden layers.

We explore a broad range of mediator masses in two main analyses: one combining BOSS Full Shape (FS) galaxy clustering with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and another combining FS with Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Our results place the strongest cosmological constraints to date on the resonant self interactions when using FS+Planck data, reaching up to $g_\\nu< 10.8 \\times 10^{-14}$ at $95\\%$ confidence for the 1 eV mediator. Notably, FS+BBN can constrain the interaction for the 10 eV mediator independently of CMB data, yielding $g_\\nu < 7.33 \\times 10^{-12}$ at $95\\%$ confidence.

Varadarajan, Lumen Boco 55 pages, 14 figures. Accepted by JCAP Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The evolution of the supermassive Black Hole (BH) population across cosmic times remains a central unresolved issue in modern astrophysics, due to the many noticeable uncertainties in the involved physical processes that span a huge range of spatial, temporal and energy scales. Here we tackle the problem via a semi-empirical approach with minimal assumptions and data-driven inputs. This is based on a continuity plus Smoluchowski equation framework that allows to unitarily describe the two primary modes of BH growth: gas accretion and binary mergers. Key quantities related to the latter processes are incorporated through educated parameterizations, and then constrained in a Bayesian setup from joint observational estimates of the local BH mass function, of the large-scale BH clustering, and of the nano-Hz stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background measured from Pulsar Timimg Array (PTA) experiments. We find that the BH accretion-related parameters are strongly dependent on the local BH mass function determination: higher normalizations and flatter high-mass slopes in the latter imply lower radiative efficiencies and mean Eddington ratios with a stronger redshift evolution. Additionally, the binary BH merger rate is estimated to be a fraction $\\lesssim 10^{-1}$ of the galaxy merger rate derived from galaxy pairs counts by \\texttt{JWST}, and constrained not to exceed the latter at $\\gtrsim 2\\sigma$. Relatedly, we highlight hints of a possible tension between current constraints on BH demographics and the interpretation of the nano-Hz GW background as predominantly caused by binary BH mergers. Specifically, we bound the latter's contribution to $\\lesssim 30-50\\%$ at $\\sim 3\\sigma$, suggesting that additional astrophysical/cosmological sources are needed to explain the residual part of the signal measured by PTA experiments.",

We provide a systematic theory derivation based on power counting, which features the first comprehensive treatment of stochastic EFT contributions -- these are found to significantly improve the match to data. Our computational pipeline utilizes the COBRA technique that expands the linear matter power spectrum over a basis of principal components based on a singular value decomposition, allowing the cosmology dependence to be captured to sub-permille accuracy with just eight templates. This transforms the problem of computing the one-loop EFT bispectrum to a simple tensor multiplication, reducing the computation time to around a second per cosmology with negligible loss of accuracy. Using these tools, we study the cosmological information in the bispectrum by analyzing PTChallenge simulations, whose gigantic volume provides the most powerful test of the one-loop EFT bispectrum so far. We find that the one-loop prediction provides an excellent match to the bispectrum data up to $k_{\\rm max}=0.15~h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, as evidenced by the precise recovery of the dark matter density $\\omega_\\text{cdm}$, Hubble constant $H_0$, and mass fluctuation amplitude $\\sigma_8$ parameters, and the amplitude of equilateral primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm equil}$. Combined with the power spectrum, the COBRA-based one-loop bispectrum multipoles yield tighter constraints than the tree-level bispectrum monopole, with the posteriors on $\\omega_{\\text{cdm}}$, $H_0$, and $\\sigma_8$ shrinking by 41\\%, 25\\%, and 19\\%, respectively. This suggests that the COBRA-based bispectrum analysis will be an important tool in the interpretation of data from ongoing redshift surveys such as DESI and Euclid.",

The model includes radiation, non-relativistic matter, and a dark-energy component with constant equation-of-state parameter w. An explicit Euler scheme implemented in Python is used to evolve a(t) into the past and the future, allowing exploration of the qualitative behavior of the expansion for different values of w, including the LCDM case (w = -1), phantom energy (w < -1), and values associated with domain walls and cosmic strings.

Here, we combine dark matter-only zoom-in simulations from the Symphony suite with the Nimbus \"star-tagging\" model of the stellar halo to assess how much information about the mass assembly of an individual galaxy cluster can be gleaned from idealized measurements of ICL outskirts. We show that the edges of a cluster's stellar profile -- the primary (Rsp*1) and secondary (Rsp*2) stellar \"splashback\" radii -- are sensitive to both continuous mass accretion histories and discrete merger events, making them potentially powerful probes of a cluster's past. We find that Rsp*1 strongly correlates with the cluster's mass ~1 dynamical time ago, while Rsp*2 traces more recent mass accretion history to a slightly lesser degree. In combination, these features can further distinguish between clusters that have and have not undergone a major merger within the past dynamical time. We use both to predict realistic cluster mass accretion histories with the MultiCAM framework. These outer ICL features are significantly more sensitive to mass accretion and merger histories than the stellar mass gap and halo concentration, and perform comparably to the commonly used X-ray-based tracer of relaxedness, x_off. While our analysis is idealized, the relevant ICL features are potentially detectable in next-generation deep imaging of nearby clusters. This work highlights the promise of ICL measurements and lays the groundwork for more detailed forecasts of their power.",

Please check this https URL (and this https URL) for downloading the figures (and data products) from this cold gas catalog Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present the first results of Vz-GAL, a high-redshift CO(J=1-0) large survey with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, targeting 92 Herschel-selected, infrared-luminous, dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at redshifts 1 to 6. These sources are selected based on having redshifts and mid/high-J CO transitions from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array z-GAL survey. We successfully detect CO(J=1-0) emission in 90/92 galaxies at the expected positions and redshifts, including 9 tentative detections at $2\\sigma - 3\\sigma$ significance, and CO(J=2-1) emission in 10 of these galaxies. The CO(J=1-0) luminosities suggest apparent gas masses in the range $\\mu {M}_{\\rm H_2}$ = $(2-20) \\times {10}^{11}~(\\alpha_{CO}/{4.0})~\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$, which implies gas depletion times of $(50-600)$ Myr. These timescales show similar spread as local ULIRGs, suggesting a self-regulatory mechanism that maintains a consistent SFR per unit gas mass in starbursts across redshifts. To quantify the contribution of \"excitation correction\" factors to gas mass estimates, we calculate median CO line brightness temperature ratios of $r_{21}=0.88\\pm0.25$, $r_{31}=0.61\\pm0.22$, $r_{41}=0.49\\pm0.15$, $r_{51}=0.47\\pm0.13$, and $r_{61}=0.28\\pm0.13$. Accounting for these corrections results in a reduced scatter in 'gas mass$-$star formation rate' relations. We also find a median log(${L}^{\\prime}_{\\mathrm{[CI]}(^{3}P_1 - ^{3}P_0)}/{L}^{\\prime}_{\\mathrm{CO}(J=1-0)})=-0.71\\pm0.12$ for a subsample of 23 sources, consistent with the ratios derived for local star-forming galaxies. Together, our findings are in agreement with common conditions in the cold gas reservoirs among star-forming galaxies over a broad range in star formation modes, efficiencies, and scales.",

We assess the detectability of these Pop III GRBs using a metallicity-based progenitor criterion and cosmological $N$-body/hydrodynamical simulations with three distinct Pop III initial mass functions (IMFs), focusing on the capabilities of the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) aboard the Einstein Probe (\\emph{EP}) and the coded-mask gamma-ray imager (ECLAIRs) aboard the Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (\\emph{SVOM}). Our population synthesis model, calibrated to \\emph{Swift} data, predicts the following Population II/I (Pop II/I) GRB detection rates at $z>6$: $\\sim2.4\\,\\mathrm{events\\,yr^{-1}}$ for \\emph{EP}/WXT and $\\sim0.9\\,\\mathrm{events\\,yr^{-1}}$ for \\emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs.

Our results indicate that while Pop III GRBs are subdominant to Pop II/I GRBs at $z<10$, their fractional contribution rises significantly with redshift, reaching $\\sim8\\%$ ($\\sim34\\%$) at $z>10$ and $\\sim28\\%$ ($\\sim68\\%$) at $z>16$ for \\emph{EP}/WXT (\\emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs). This trend is systematically enhanced in the other two IMF models, which adopt a lower stellar mass range of $\\mathrm{[0.1,\\,100]\\,M_\\odot}$. We conclude that detecting Pop III GRBs at high redshifts is a realistic prospect, and any GRB detected at $z>16$ is most likely of Pop III origin.",

Lett. 995 (2025) L8 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The tidal torque theory (TTT) predicts that galaxy spins are correlated with the surrounding tidal field, reflecting how angular momentum is acquired during structure formation. We present a new observational test of this prediction using the final data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory integral field spectroscopy survey, which enables direct spin measurements from stellar and ionized gas kinematics for a sample of 6325 disk galaxies. We utilize the three-dimensional tidal field reconstructed from the galaxy distribution, providing a physically defined reference frame for the analysis. We find that massive galaxies tend to align their spins parallel to the intermediate axis of the tidal field, consistent with the prediction of the TTT, while also showing a tendency to align perpendicular to the major axis. In contrast, low-mass galaxies exhibit the opposite trend, with a transition mass of $M_* \\sim 10^{10}-10^{10.5}M_\\odot$. No significant alignment is detected with respect to the minor axis across all stellar masses. We further examine the dependence on morphology and environment, finding that S0 and early-type spiral galaxies exhibit stronger alignment signals than late-type spirals. The alignment trend becomes particularly pronounced in regions of high tidal anisotropy and high overdensity. A mutual information analysis identifies these environmental factors as the dominant drivers of the observed trends. Our results provide new empirical evidence for the connection between galaxy spins and the cosmic tidal field.",

Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Letters High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The observational efficiency of pulsars, defined as the ratio of the observationally derived isotropic-equivalent luminosity, $4\\pi d_{obs}^2 F_{obs}$, where $F_{obs}$ is the average pulsed energy flux of a pulsar and $d_{obs}$ is its estimated distance, to its energy budget, shows a wide range of values. This dispersion is believed to be a combination of beaming effects, different geometries, and case-by-case variability of the emission mechanism efficiency, but it is not clear in what proportion. In this work we focused on the gamma-ray range and analysed the four main ingredients that likely contribute to this dispersion: the geometrical term arising from the anisotropic emission (beaming), viewing and inclination angles, the uncertainty on the pulsar distance, the uncertainty on the moment of inertia, and the intrinsic efficiency of the mechanism producing the gamma-ray emission. Estimating the expected ranges of the moment of inertia and the distance errors, and considering a geometrical and spectral model that we have recently used to fit the light curves and spectra of the entire gamma-ray pulsar population, we estimate the a priori distribution of the first three ingredients in order to obtain the a posteriori distribution of the intrinsic efficiency of the mechanism. We found the latter to peak at $\\sim 5-15 \\%$ and to have a dispersion of around one order of magnitude. That is, we found the intrinsic efficiency of the mechanism to be the leading factor in the observed dispersion. In addition, we found little sensitivity of these results on different distributions of the estimated pulsar distance errors, and saw that the weak, alleged correlation with the spin-down power can only explain part of the observed dispersion. This methodology can be easily applied to other geometrical models of the emission, to test the sensitivity of these results on the beaming distribution.",

Submitted to the Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer (JQSRT) on 12/2/2025 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We derive a grey linear diffusion equation for photons with respect to inertial (or lab-frame) space and time, using asymptotic analysis in 1D planar geometry. The solution of the equation is the comoving radiation energy density. Our analysis does not make use of assumptions about the magnitude of velocity; instead we derive an asymptotic scaling in the lab frame such that we avoid apparent non-physical pathologies that are encountered with the standard static-matter scaling. We permit the photon direction to be continuous (as opposed to constraining the analysis to discrete ordinates). The result is a drift-diffusion equation in the lab frame for comoving radiation energy density, with an adiabatic term that matches the standard semi-relativistic diffusion equation. Following a recent study for discrete directions, this equation reduces to a pure advection equation as the velocity approaches the speed of light. We perform preliminary numerical experiments comparing solutions to relativistic lab-frame Monte Carlo transport and to the well-known semi-relativistic diffusion equation.",

Sindhuja 27 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, Submitted to Solr Physics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We investigated the occurrence rate of the sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) events from the Sun using Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data covering solar cycle (SC) 24 and the rising and maximum phases of SC 25. Due to a solar array drive assembly malfunction starting in March 2018, only small number (15) of SGRE events were observed during SC 25. Over the first 61 months, the average sunspot number (SSN) increased from 56.9 in SC 24 to 79.0 in SC 25. Fast and wide (FW) CMEs and decameter-hectometric (DH) type II bursts also increased significantly in SC 25 by 29% and 33%, respectively when normalized to SSN. Therefore, the increase in solar activity should result in a higher number of SGREs in SC 25. We estimated the number of SGREs in SC 25 using three methods. (i) If the SGRE number varies commensurate FW CMEs and DH type II bursts, SC 25 should have 45-47 SGRE events. (ii) In SC 24, ~17% of FW CMEs and 25% of DH type II bursts were associated with SGRE events. At this rate, SC 25 should have 46 SGRE events. (iii) Since SGRE events are invariably associated with >100 keV hard X-ray (HXR) bursts, we identified DH type II bursts associated with >100 keV HXR bursts from Fermi gamma ray burst monitor (GBM) during LAT data gaps. Based on our finding that SGRE events in SCs 24 and 25 were all associated with HXR bursts of duration > ~5 min, we found only 27 of the 79 LAT-gap type II bursts had >100 keV HXR bursts with duration > ~5 min. These DH type II bursts are likely to indicate SGRE, bringing the total number of SGRE events to 42 (15 observed + 27 inferred). Thus, the three methods provide similar estimates of the number of SGRE events in SC 25. We, therefore, conclude that that SC 25 is stronger than SC 24 based on the estimated number SGRE events. Halo CMEs, ground level enhancement (GLE) events, and intense geomagnetic storms are also consistent with a stronger SC 25.",

Published in Nature Astronomy, 4 December 2025 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The elements in the universe are synthesized primarily in stars and supernovae, where nuclear fusion favors the production of even-Z elements. In contrast, odd-Z elements are less abundant and their yields are highly dependent on detailed stellar physics, making theoretical predictions of their cosmic abundance uncertain. In particular, the origin of odd-Z elements such as phosphorus (P), chlorine (Cl), and potassium (K), which are important for planet formation and life, is poorly understood. While the abundances of these elements in Milky Way stars are close to solar values, supernova explosion models systematically underestimate their production by up to an order of magnitude, indicating that key mechanisms for odd-Z nucleosynthesis are currently missing from theoretical models. Here we report the observation of P, Cl, and K in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A using high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with XRISM, with the detection of K at above the 6$\\sigma$ level being the most significant finding. Supernova explosion models of normal massive stars cannot explain the element abundance pattern, especially the high abundances of Cl and K, while models that include stellar rotation, binary interactions or shell mergers agree closely with the observations.

Champion, Michael Kramer 11 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication by A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) One of the imminent science goals of pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) is the detection of a continuous gravitational wave (CGW) emitted by an individual supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB). SMBHBs that cause CGWs with GW frequencies $f_\\mathrm{GW} > 10 \\text{nHz}$ have undergone significant orbital evolution, hence a change of $f_\\mathrm{GW}$ over time. In PTA data sets with sufficiently long observational time span, this means that the Earth and pulsar terms' contributions to the CGW signal signature can eventually become resolvable. Since the pulsar term is accumulated incoherently and thus often treated as an additional source of noise, this separation can prove to be beneficial for the detection of the CGW signal in the PTA data set. We aim to investigate to what extent resolvable Earth and pulsar terms affect currently used techniques for CGW searches with PTA data sets, that treat the pulsar term as an additional source noise. We focus on the dependency of the pulsar term frequencies on the pulsar's distance. We aim to answer the question of whether adding more distant pulsars to a PTA data set can mitigate biases and improve the detection of CGWs. We show that under ideal conditions, more distant pulsars can facilitate the CGW search with PTA data sets. Bayesian parameter estimation is yielding better parameter constraints and the frequentist per-frequentist optimal statistic search becomes more stable. However, using the realistic data set simulations, it was found that other configuration parameters of a PTA, such as the anisotropic distribution of pulsars and the effective number of pulsars in a PTA, can play a crucial role to the importance of this effect.",

Because of violent mass motions that take place during the explosion, core-collapse supernovae have been considered a potential source of detectable gravitational waveforms for decades. However, their intrinsic stochasticity makes ineffective the use of modelled techniques such as matched filtering, forcing us to develop model independent technique to unveil their nature. In this work we present MUSE pipeline, which is based on a classification procedure of the time-frequency images using a Convolutional Neural Network. The network is trained on phenomenological waveforms that are built to mimic the main common features observed in numerical simulation. The method is finally tested on a representative 3D simulation catalog in the context of Einstein Telescope, a third generation GW telescope.

Bose High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Recent detections of very high energy (VHE; GeV-TeV) photons from gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows, most notably the extreme event GRB 221009A, require refined models that include realistic jet structures and complex circumburst environments. The jet's angular structure is crucial for shaping afterglow emission. Our recent work demonstrates that Gaussian jets, with their smooth angular decline, naturally produce early bright peaks for on-axis observers and delayed, softer, dimmer peaks at higher inclinations. The gradual decline suppresses excessive lateral expansion, unlike the sharp edge in top-hat jets, making Gaussian jets a compelling alternative to both top-hat and other structured-jet models. Here we implement a Gaussian structured-jet model to explain TeV afterglows from adiabatic forward shocks propagating in a wind-driven medium. We show that the TeV peak time and flux depend sensitively on jet geometry, kinetic energy, wind density, and on microphysical parameter ratios that scale the SSC component. We identify the afterglow parameter space that is favourable for detecting sub-TeV photons with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), finding that only about ten per cent of simulated TeV events exceed CTA sensitivity in a wind medium. These detections arise from near core-aligned views, with high kinetic energy and wind density, moderate initial Lorentz factor and downstream magnetic field, and a relatively large fraction of energy in nonthermal electrons. Applying this model to GRB 221009A, we perform multi-band fits including wind-modified dynamics, Klein-Nishina effects, and EBL attenuation, and find that a mildly off-axis geometry reproduces the observed X-ray and GeV-TeV light curves.",

Young, Charlotte R. Angus, Joshua Weston High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's 10-Year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to produce a hundredfold increase in the number of transients we observe. However, there are insufficient spectroscopic resources to follow up on all of the wealth of targets that LSST will provide. As such it is necessary to be able to prioritise objects for followup observations or inclusion in sample studies based purely on their LSST photometry. We are particularly keen to identify tidal disruption events (TDEs) with LSST. TDEs are immensely useful for determining black hole parameters and probing our understanding of accretion physics. To assist in these efforts, we present the Many Artificial LSST Lightcurves based on the Observations of Real Nuclear transients (MALLORN) data set and the corresponding classifier challenge for identifying TDEs. MALLORN comprises 10178 simulated LSST light curves, constructed from real Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations of 64 TDEs, 727 nuclear supernovae and 1407 AGN with spectroscopic labels using Gaussian process fitting, empirically-motivated spectral energy distributions from SNCosmo and the baseline from the Rubin Survey Simulator. Our novel approach can be easily adapted to simulate transients for any photometric survey using observations from another, requiring only the limiting magnitudes and an estimate of the cadence of observations. The MALLORN Astronomical Classification Challenge, launched on Kaggle on 15/10/2025, will allow competitors to test their photometric classifiers on simulated LSST data to find TDEs and improve upon their capabilities prior to the start of LSST.",

Using VLT/MUSE integral field spectroscopy, we uncover chemical and kinematic connections between the nebula surrounding its Central Compact Object (CXOU J085201.4-461753) and the nearby Herbig-Haro outflow of Ve 7-27 (Wray 16-30), indicating a shared nitrogen-rich, Fe-peak-enhanced environment. This link ties stellar birth and death, with the young star Ve 7-27 embedded in material expelled by Vela Junior's massive progenitor, and the remnant's blast wave is expanding through the same medium. Adopting the Gaia-based distance to Ve 7-27, we revise Vela Junior's distance to $1.41\\pm0.14$ kpc. At this distance, the remnant's physical radius is $23.3\\pm2.3$ pc, and X-ray proper motions of the northwestern rim correspond to shock speeds of $(2.8\\pm0.7)\\times10^3$ to $(5.6\\pm1.5)\\times10^3$ km s$^{-1}$. These imply an age of $\\sim$1.6-3.3 kyr and a very low ambient density, indicating that Vela Junior is expanding within a highly rarefied wind-blown cavity carved by a massive progenitor -- consistent with the non-detection of strong thermal X-ray emission.

A comprehensive fitting framework is developed, constrained by prior knowledge of moment of inertia participation from previous glitch studies. We apply a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to quantify uncertainties and parameter correlations. The model reproduces the observed timing data and yields physically consistent values for moment of inertia fractions and creep timescales. Our results indicate that inward creep and a long-term change in external torque dominate the observed increase in spin-down rate, pointing to structural changes within the star-likely triggered by a crustquake that initiated both vortex motion and a change in the moment of inertia. We estimate that the glitch involved approximately $2.4 \\times 10^{12}$ inward-moving vortices and $\\sim 142$ crustal plates with a typical size of $\\sim 0.03$ km.

      "abstract": "Spectrum and anisotropies of Galactic cosmic rays: a laboratory for magnetic fields Philipp Mertsch (Aachen) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Much has been learned about Galactic cosmic rays in the past decade: On the observational side, the spectra of cosmic ray nuclei have been directly measured with high precision, resolving chemical composition up to TV rigidities. At even higher rigidities, direct detection is making contact with indirect observations from air shower arrays. A number of breaks have been found in the nuclear spectrum, which was previously thought to be a pure power law up to the knee. Data from air shower arrays also show interesting features in the arrival directions of cosmic-ray nuclei. On the theoretical side, more sophisticated models are able to explain the various spectral breaks either with transitions between different classes of sources or with changes in the transport regime. Yet, it has become clear that our ignorance of the structure of the Galactic magnetic fields, both on large and small scales, is limiting precision predictions. Turning this problem into an opportunity though, we can use Galactic cosmic rays as a laboratory for the study of Galactic magnetic fields. In this review talk, delivered at the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC2025), I have summarised what is known about the spectrum and anisotropies of Galactic cosmic rays, what is not known yet and what can be learnt in the future.",

Brink, WeiKang Zheng To appear in the Astrophysical Journal High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We report on new orbit-minimum photometry and revised radial-velocity fitting that provide an improved measurement of the mass of the neutron star (NS) in pulsar PSR~J0952$-$0607 at $M_NS = 2.35\\pm 0.11 M_\\odot$. With its fast spin and unusually low magnetic field, this NS has evidently experienced unusual evolution, likely connected with its high mass, which is now $2.5\\sigma$ above that of the heaviest pulsar with a white dwarf companion, as measured by Shapiro delay techniques. By tightening the mass measurement, we also raise the maximum (commonly called Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff) NS mass to $M_{\\rm TOV} > 2.27\\,M_\\odot$$(2.12\\,M_\\odot)$ at $1\\sigma$$(3\\sigma)$ confidence, which improves bounds on the dense-matter equation of state. While the statistical error decreases and systematic issues should be modest, uncertainties remain; we comment briefly on these factors and prospects for further improvement.",

Shin Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex) Ultra-high-energy photons play an important role in probing astrophysical models and beyond-Standard-Model scenarios. We report updated limits on the diffuse photon flux using Telescope Array's Surface Detector data collected over 14 years of operation. Our method employs a neural network classifier to effectively distinguish between proton-induced and photon-induced events. The input data include both reconstructed composition-sensitive parameters and raw time-resolved signals registered by the Surface Detector stations. To mitigate biases from Monte Carlo simulations, we fine-tune the network with a subset of experimental data. The number of observed photon candidates is found to be consistent with the expected hadronic background, yielding upper limits on photon flux $\\Phi_\\gamma(E_\\gamma > 10^{19} \\text{eV}) < 2.3 \\cdot 10^{-3} $, and $\\Phi_\\gamma(E_\\gamma > 10^{20} \\text{eV}) < 3.0 \\cdot 10^{-4} $ $ (\\text{km}^2 \\cdot \\text{sr} \\cdot \\text{yr})^{-1} $.",

As an example, we derive a simple equation that classifies fast radio bursts (FRBs) into two distinct Gaussian distributions, indicating the existence of two physical classes. This human-AI workflow integrates feature selection, dimensional analysis, and symbolic regression: deep learning first analyzes CHIME Catalog 1 and identifies six independent parameters that collectively provide a complete description of FRBs; guided by Buckingham-$\\pi$ analysis and correlation analysis, humans then construct dimensionless groups; finally, symbolic regression performed by the machine discovers the governing equation. When applied to the newer CHIME Catalog, the equation produces consistent results, demonstrating that it captures the underlying physics. This framework is applicable to a broad range of scientific domains.",

Zhadan Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We study the possibility of registering high-energy extensive air showers (EAS) by the onshore detector facility simultaneously with the trigger of the Baikal-GVD neutrino telescope. The location of the surface detector array on the shore of Lake Baikal is motivated by the fact that permanent placement of detectors on the surface of the lake is challenging. Within the given geometry, simultaneous registration is possible for EAS with a zenith angle of about 76 degrees within the limited solid angle. The corresponding inclined EAS are dominated by muons and significantly attenuated. The installation will make it possible to obtain an estimate of the number of high-energy muons in EAS. This, subsequently, would make it possible to verify EAS modeling and calculations of the atmospheric neutrino flux. The detector may also be used for cross-calibration of energy and direction measurements by the neutrino telescope. We use the CORSIKA program to simulate the registration of EAS on the shore close to the Baikal-GVD. The propagation of ultra-high energy muons produced by EAS through 3.5 km of water and their registration by Baikal-GVD is simulated using the PROPOSAL package. We calculate the minimal total area of the onshore detectors suitable for several cosmic ray energy thresholds, starting from 1 PeV. The report presents estimates of the number of events jointly registered by the onshore installation and the Baikal-GVD the EAS registration detector systems with different areas.",

Ho, Junhui Fan Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a systematic investigation of long-term mid-infrared (MIR) color variability in 1,718 Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1s) using 14-year \\textit{WISE}/NEOWISE monitoring data. Through Pearson correlation analysis between photometric magnitude and color, we identify: (1) a radio-quiet NLSy1 (RQ-NLSy1) population comprising 230 bluer-when-brighter (BWB) sources, 131 redder-when-brighter (RWB) sources, and 1,323 objects showing weak or statistically insignificant color variations; and (2) a radio-loud NLSy1 (RL-NLSy1) population containing 5 BWBs, 2 RWBs, and 27 sources with weak/no color variations. Our analysis reveals that the BWB tendency strengthens significantly in galaxies with redder mean MIR colors $\\rm \\left<W1-W2\\right>$ and lower starlight contamination. Furthermore, this color-change pattern demonstrates that the most bolometric luminous sources exhibit the most pronounced BWB behavior. While similar trends exist for black hole mass and Eddington ratio, bolometric luminosity appears to be the primary physical driver. Potential origins of these variations (e.g., host galaxy contribution, accretion disk variability, and dust reprocessing) are discussed. We conclude that temperature-dependent dust reprocessing dominates the observed BWB, RWB, and no/weak variation patterns. This interpretation may also apply to similar MIR color variations observed in other extragalactic MIR transients, such as tidal disruption events, ambiguous nuclear transients, and changing-look AGNs. In addition, we find no significant difference in long-term MIR color variations between RL-NLSy1s and RQ-NLSy1s, however, RL-NLSy1s show significantly greater dispersion in intrinsic variability amplitude compared to RQ-NLSy1s due to jet-induced complexity, where non-thermal synchrotron emission from relativistic jets obscures thermal dust signatures.",

Sim, Austen Wallis 9 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Radiation pressure on spectral lines is a promising mechanism for powering disc winds from accreting white dwarfs (AWDs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, in radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, overionization reduces line opacity and quenches the line force, which suppresses outflows. Here, we show that small-scale clumping can resolve this problem. Adopting the microclumping approximation, our new simulations demonstrate that even modest volume filling factors ($f_V \\sim 0.1-0.01$) can dramatically increase the wind mass-loss rate by lowering its ionization state -- raising $\\dot{M}_{\\rm wind}$ and yielding $\\dot{M}_{\\rm wind}/\\dot{M}_{\\rm acc}\\!\\gtrsim\\!10^{-4}$ for such modest filling factors. Clumpy wind models produce the UV resonance lines that are absent from smooth wind models. They can also reprocess a significant fraction of the disc luminosity and thus dramatically modify the broad-band optical/UV SED. Given that theory and observations indicate that disc winds are intrinsically inhomogeneous, clumping offers a physically motivated solution. Together, these results provide the first robust, self-consistent demonstration that clumping can reconcile line-driven wind theory with observations across AWDs and AGNs.",

However, if ALPs are heavier than $\\sim 400\\,$MeV, the explosion is failed or weaker than that for the models with smaller $m_{\\,a}$, because of an insufficient temperature inside the supernova core to produce heavy ALPs. The maximum temperature in the core depends on the initial progenitor structure.

Tendulkar 11 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables; accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Follow-up studies of persistent emission from fast radio burst (FRB) sources are critical for understanding their elusive emission mechanisms and the nature of their progenitors. This work presents new observations of the persistent radio source (PRS) associated with FRB 20190520B. We observe a gradual decay in the PRS brightness, which is punctuated by periods of brightening and dimming at both 1.5 and 3 GHz. Furthermore, our low-frequency ($<1$ GHz) observations--the first for this source--reveal evidence of a spectral break, which can be attributed to absorption processes. Interpreted within the framework of the magnetar wind nebula model, our data constrain the age of the magnetar progenitor to $52^{+16}_{-10}$ yr, broadly consistent with previous work. Assuming the observed 1.5 GHz variability is driven by scintillation, we discuss the constraints on the size of the persistent source. The observations presented here challenge the predictions of the previously published best-fit hypernebula model for this source.",

The most recent NICER measurement of PSR J0614-3329 reported an equatorial radius of $R_{eq} = 10.29^{+1.01}_{-0.86}$ km for a mass of $M = 1.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07} M_{\\odot}$. Considering all the NICER measurements to date, we find substantial evidence using Bayesian hypothesis ranking for strange quark stars over physically motivated models of neutron stars compatible with this low radius. This provides a strong case for quark matter in neutron stars and also for the possible existence of strange quark stars, a consequence of the Bodmer-Witten hypothesis, suggesting that they could be considered among the population of compact stars during analyses of astrophysical data. Using a wide sample of equations of state, we report the nucleonic equations of state that best fit current observations and rule out one model of strange quark matter.",

The poloidal flux is approximated by the self-similar twisted dipole field. The toroidal field is obtained by the minimum torque model. Under this approximation, it is found that: (1) The Y-point radius decreases with the increase of twist of the magnetic field. (2) The polar cap is larger for larger twist. (3) The particle outflow luminosity is larger for larger twist. (4) The maximum acceleration potential, pulse width of magnetar radio emission both increase with the twist. (5) For an untwisting magnetosphere, the physical properties evolve toward that of the normal pulsars. The above findings are consistent with previous analytical and numerical results. The larger polar cap may correspond to the hot spot during magnetar outburst. In general, a rotating twisted magnetosphere has larger open field line regions. The radio emission of magnetars and fast radio bursts may both originate in the larger and evolving open field line regions of magnetars.",

V2: minor clarifications, results unchanged, accepted by JETP Letters High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) From gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A, very high-energy photons were detected: >10 TeV with LHAASO and >100 TeV with Carpet-3. Such energetic photons are expected to be absorbed via electron-positron pair production on their way to the Earth. Their observation might be explained by new physics, including Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) or photon mixing with axion-like particles (ALPs). Here, we construct a joint fluence spectrum by combining flux measurements from both experiments, and fit it under these hypotheses. While LIV can account for the Carpet-3 observation, it provides only a modest improvement over standard physics in the overall fit and requires parameters excluded by other constraints. ALP mixing improves the description of both LHAASO and Carpet-3 data, yielding a substantial enhancement in fit quality for a specific region of the ALP parameter space.",

Many FRBs exhibit multi-component structures, which encode information about their emission mechanisms or progenitor systems and thus provide important clues to their origins. In this work, we systematically analyze the burst morphology of FRB 20190520B and compare component distributions across four active FRBs observed with FAST: FRB 20121102A, FRB 20190520B, FRB 20201124A, and FRB 20240114A. We find that multi-component burst-clusters show spectral properties similar to single-peak bursts, and no periodicity is detected in their temporal behavior. The component-count distributions follow a power law, revealing scale-free behavior consistent with self-organized criticality (SOC) processes. Multi-component clusters account for 12-30% of all detected bursts, regardless of source activity, providing new insights into burst-to-burst variability and the physical processes driving FRB emission.",

Hasan Barbhuiya, Lynn Wilson III, Drew Turner 9 pages, 3 figures, a lot of appendices Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) Collisionless plasma shocks are a common feature of many space and astrophysical systems and are sources of high-energy particles and non-thermal emission, channeling as much as 20\\% of the shock's energy into non-thermal particles. The generation and acceleration of these non-thermal particles have been extensively studied, however, how these particles feed back on the shock hydrodynamics has not been fully treated. This work presents the results of self-consistent hybrid particle-in-cell simulations that show the effect of self-generated non-thermal particle populations on the nature of collisionless, quasi-parallel shocks. They contribute to a significant heat flux density upstream of the shock. Non-thermal particles downstream of the shock leak into the upstream region, taking energy away from the shock. This increases the compression ratio, slows the shock down, and flattens the non-thermal population's spectral index for lower Mach number shocks. We incorporate this into a revised theory for the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions that include this effect and it shows excellent agreement with simulations. The results have the potential to explain discrepancies between predictions and observations in a wide range of systems, such as inaccuracies of predictions of arrival times of coronal mass ejections and the conflicting radio and x-ray observations of intracluster shocks. These effects will likely need to be included in fluid modeling to accurately predict shock evolution.",

We investigate the analogous process in fully kinetic plasma turbulence by using high-resolution, direct numerical simulations in two spatial dimensions. We observe the formation of long-living vortices with a profile typical of macroscopic, magnetically dominated force-free states. Inspired by the Harris pinch model for inhomogeneous equilibria, we describe these metastable solutions with a self-consistent kinetic model in a cylindrical coordinate system centered on a representative vortex, starting from an explicit form of the particle velocity distribution function. Such new equilibria can be simplified to a Gold-Hoyle solution of the modified force-free state. Turbulence is mediated by the long-living structures, accompanied by transients in which such vortices merge and form self-similarly new metastable equilibria. This process can be relevant to the comprehension of various astrophysical phenomena, going from the formation of plasmoids in the vicinity of massive compact objects to the emergence of coherent structures in the heliosphere.",

Silverman, Frédéric Bournaud, Miroslava Dessauges-Zavadsky, Emanuele Daddi, Annagrazia Puglisi, Xuheng Ding, Si-Yue Yu Accepted for publication in ApJ; 21 pages, 14 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) In this work, we explore the nature of $z>1$ galactic bars. Once thought to be highly transient, our results demonstrate otherwise. Our sample consists of nine massive ($>10^{10.5}\\,\\rm M_{\\odot}$) star-forming barred-spiral galaxies at $z_{\\rm spec} \\sim 1.5$. Using rest-frame near-IR (F444W) JWST/NIRCam imaging, we apply ellipse fitting along with 1D and 2D morphological modeling to directly measure bar properties. We find that five galaxies host flat surface brightness profiles (bar Sérsic index $<0.4$), indicative of highly evolved, \"mature\" bars. By contrast, only two galaxies show exponential profiles, characteristic of young bars, and these are also shorter in absolute length than the flat bars. We therefore conclude that a large fraction of bars at this epoch have already matured, thereby indicating the presence of well-settled disks required to facilitate bar formation and sustained evolution well before $z\\sim1.5$. To assess the gravitational impact of the bars, we calculate the maximum transverse-to-radial force ratio ($Q_{b}$). We find that $Q_{b}$ values are comparable to, or weaker than, those of bars in the local Universe, Seven of the nine bars show only a marginal increase in strength with maturity (from exponential to flat bars). Contrarily however, the remaining two bars are flat, but have the lowest $Q_{b}$ values in our sample. We hence propose that the mature bars at $z\\sim 1.5$ may experience phases of weakening due to rapid gas inflows and/or minor mergers. In conclusion, our work sheds light on the rapidly evolving nature of high-z bars and paves the way for larger statistical studies.",

In a sample of 16 Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) without previous black-hole mass measurements we discover 8 UMBHs based on direct dynamical detections with triaxial Schwarzschild models. This first sample of triaxial black-hole mass determinations increases the number of known UMBHs by a factor of two and dramatically increases the constraints for BH mass scaling relations at the high-mass end. We find that BCGs are outliers in the canonical BH - $\\sigma$ relation, while the size of their depleted cores - the central light-deficient region - is a much better unbiased predictor of the black hole mass and should be used as a proxy at the high-mass end. BCGs smoothly join the trend already established for massive core galaxies in previous studies. This also holds for tight correlations between core size and sphere-of-influence radius and core size and core density. All these relations strongly support the black-hole binary model for the formation of the centers of the most massive galaxies.",

We show that, whilst overall the magnetic field is only energetically dominant for a small fraction of the ISM, it becomes important in the thermally unstable regime (45.2% of the mass is magnetically dominated), and in the majority of the cold neutral medium (66.1% of the mass). In the molecular gas, the magnetic field dominates more of the total mass budget (39.8%) than thermal energy, turbulent kinetic energy, or gas self-gravitating potential energy. However, much of this gas will be CO-dark. This suggests that magnetic forces are non-negligible during the formation of cold dense gas, which will slow its collapse and lead to an increase in the fraction of cold atomic, and molecular gas in the ISM. Consequently, star-forming clouds may be surrounded by a larger reservoir of cold gas than would otherwise be expected.",

Vivas Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC) are the Milky Way's nearest interacting galaxy pair, offering a unique laboratory for studying tidal effects on galactic disks. Despite extensive survey efforts, the three-dimensional geometry of the Clouds, particularly the putative warp of the LMC, remains poorly constrained due to incompleteness in their crowded centers and the low stellar density of their peripheries, which demand wide-field coverage. Using red-clump (RC) stars as standard candles, corrected for age- and metallicity-dependent population effects with empirically calibrated color-magnitude relations and spatially resolved star-formation histories, we construct the most detailed distance map of the Magellanic System to date. Based on $\\sim$2.3 million RC stars from \\textit{Gaia} DR3 combined with modern reddening maps, we measure median heliocentric distances of $50.62 \\pm 2.32$~kpc for the LMC (to $\\sim$23$^{\\circ}$) and $60.75 \\pm 2.85$~kpc for the SMC (to $\\sim$12$^{\\circ}$). The maps reveal substructures including the LMC Northern Arm, southern hooks, the Magellanic Bridge, and SMC peripheral over-densities, with refreshed distance estimates. Fitting the LMC disk within $7^{\\circ}$ yields a global inclination of $i = 25.32^{\\circ} \\pm 0.10^{\\circ}$ and line-of-nodes position angle of $\\theta = 142.34^{\\circ} \\pm 0.21^{\\circ}$. Most strikingly, we find the LMC periphery is warped azimuthally into a U-shaped structure reaching vertical amplitudes of $\\sim$7~kpc at radii of $\\sim$15~kpc. We interpret this warp as a tidal response to the most recent close passage of the SMC $\\sim$300 Myr ago, providing new constraints on the orbital history and dynamical evolution of the Magellanic Clouds.",

Comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Little red dots (LRDs) newly discovered with JWST are active galactic nuclei (AGN) that may represent black hole (BH) growth at the earliest cosmic epochs. These sources show puzzling features unlike typical AGNs, including red optical continua, weak hot-dust emission, and a lack of detectable X-rays. Previously, LRDs have often been interpreted as dust-reddened AGNs, leading to severe inconsistencies with the luminosity and BH mass densities inferred for previously known AGNs over $0<z<5$. The BH-envelope (BHE) model has been proposed to explain these characteristics, in which an accreting BH is enshrouded by a dense, optically thick gaseous envelope. In this Letter, we reanalyze the SEDs of $\\sim 400$ photometric LRDs in the COSMOS-Web survey using the BHE model and reassess their implications for cosmological BH evolution. We find that the optical-NIR spectra of LRDs are well reproduced by blackbody emission with an effective temperatures of $4000-6000~\\K$. Within the BHE framework, the inferred bolometric luminosities decrease by $\\gtrsim1-2$ orders of magnitude compared to dust-reddened AGN assumptions. As a result, the revised luminosity function, BH accretion density, and BH mass function become consistent with those of AGNs at $z<5$. The stellar masses of LRD hosts are estimated by attributing the UV excesses to star formation. Although the resulting $M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star$ ratio remains higher than the local empirical value, the excess is modest. Overall, the BHE model not only resolves the spectral features of LRDs but also brings their statistical properties into agreement with the broader cosmological BH population.",

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present 4,110 strong gravitational lens candidates, 3,887 of which are new discoveries, selected from a sample of 5,837,154 luminous red galaxies (LRGs) observed with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Candidates are identified via the presence of background ionized oxygen [O II] nebular emission lines in the foreground LRG spectra which may originate from the lensing of higher redshift star-forming galaxies. Using the measured foreground redshift, background redshift, and integrated flux of the background [O II] doublet, we integrate over impact parameters to compute the probability that each candidate is a lens. We expect 53% of candidates to be true lenses with Einstein radii ranging from 0.1'' to 4'', which can be confirmed with high-resolution imaging. Confirmed strong lenses from this sample will form a valuable cosmological dataset, as strong gravitational lensing is the only method to directly measure dark matter halo substructure at cosmological distances. We independently recover the host of the multiply imaged gravitationally lensed type Ia supernova iPTF16geu (Goobar et al. 2017). Monitoring these lenses for future multiply lensed transients will enable a) H0 measurements via time-delay cosmography and b) substructure measurements via flux ratios.",

We used data obtained with the 15 GHz VLBA in MJD 54838-60262 and data from the 15 GHz OVRO 40 m single dish telescope in MJD 54474-59023. We used a variability timescale and a causality argument of a linear size to measure the angular diameter distance to the source. To constrain the Doppler factor, we applied the relation between the rest-frame brightness temperature of the emission region and the observed brightness temperature. To calculate the observed brightness temperature, the angular size and flux density variation of the emission region are required. The angular size of the emission region (i.e., the VLBA core) was obtained from a FWHM, which is a circular Gaussian model-fitting parameter that ranges from 0.048-0.228 mas, and its uncertainty is determined to be 1.8-13 %. Using the OVRO SD light curve, we obtained a variability timescale of $128.0_{-0.3}^{+0.2}$ days and a peak flux density of $1.750_{-0.104}^{+0.015}$ Jy for the largest flare that peaked on MJD $58921.7_{-5.5}^{+2.6}$. We assumed a disk brightness geometry, equipartition brightness temperature ($5\\times10^{10}$ K), and perfect radius. Using the VLBA core sizes obtained near the flare peaks, we found consistent distance measurement results with the $\\Lambda$CDM model within 1$\\sigma$ uncertainties. We suggest that the best distance from the source is $941_{-64}^{+59}$ Mpc, which is comparable with the $\\Lambda$CDM distance of $948.2\\pm13.5$ Mpc. The distance measurement should indeed be taken at the peak of a flare. We found that the decomposed timescale allowed us to obtain consistent distances with the $\\Lambda$CDM. We strongly suggest to decompose light curves when the variability timescales are to be obtained properly.",

This relation has been shown to persist across various models of a galaxy's H I surface density profile. Using the Simba cosmological simulations, we investigate the robustness of this relation under different feedback prescriptions, including cases where specific feedback mechanisms are absent. While the global properties of galaxies are significantly affected by changes in feedback, the H I mass-size relation remains intact. Moreover, its parameters consistently align with the best available empirical measurements. We analyze the H I mass distributions of galaxies and demonstrate that, regardless of the feedback scenario, galaxies within a given H I mass bin exhibit outer H I radial profiles well approximated by an exponential function. Furthermore, the exponential decline rate remains remarkably similar across different physical prescriptions. We attribute the persistence of the H I mass-size relation to this inherent self-similarity in the H I mass distributions.",

In this work, we introduce a framework that leverages Flow Matching and Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) to jointly infer the parameters of the GD-1 progenitor and the global properties of the Milky Way potential. Our aim is to move beyond traditional techniques (e.g. orbit-fitting and action-angle methods) by constructing a fully Bayesian, likelihood-free posterior over both host-galaxy parameters and progenitor properties, thereby capturing the intrinsic coupling between tidal stripping dynamics and the underlying potential. To achieve this, we generate a large suite of mock GD-1-like streams using our differentiable N-body code \\textsc{\\texttt{Odisseo}}, sampling self-consistent initial conditions from a Plummer sphere and evolving them in a flexible Milky Way potential model. We then apply conditional Flow Matching to learn the vector field that transports a base Gaussian distribution into the posterior, enabling efficient, amortized inference directly from stream phase-space data. We demonstrate that our method successfully recovers the true parameters of a fiducial GD-1 simulation, producing well-calibrated posteriors and accurately reproducing parameter degeneracies arising from progenitor-host interactions. Flow Matching provides a powerful, flexible framework for Galactic Archaeology. Our approach enables joint inference on progenitor and Galactic parameters, capturing complex dependencies that are difficult to model with classical likelihood-based methods.",

The central stellar velocity dispersion is one of the fundamental dynamical tracers of the total mass of galaxy subhalos, alongside luminosity and stellar mass. Because it reflects the gravitational potential, the stellar velocity dispersion is expected to be relatively insensitive to feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), a critical process that regulates the connection between other galaxy observables and subhalo mass. To examine the impact of AGN feedback, we analyze the VDFs from five EAGLE simulation runs, each adopting a different AGN feedback model: one \"standard\", two \"enhanced\", one \"reduced\", and one with no AGN feedback. We compute the stellar velocity dispersions of pressure-supported galaxies using member stellar particles, mimicking fiber spectroscopy. The VDFs from the standard and enhanced AGN feedback models show little difference. However, contrary to our initial expectation that the VDF shape would be largely insensitive to AGN feedback, the simulations with reduced and no AGN feedback show a significant excess of high velocity dispersion galaxies ($\\sigma_{*}$ > 200 km s$^{-1}$) and a deficit of low dispersion galaxies (100 < $\\sigma_{*}$ (km s$^{-1}$) < 200), compared to those with standard or enhanced AGN feedback. The presence of high velocity dispersion galaxies in the no-AGN model arises from enhanced central star formation, due to the absence of AGN-driven gas heating or expulsion. Our results demonstrate that the shape of the theoretical VDF is sensitive to the strength of AGN feedback. These predictions offer a theoretical benchmark for future observational studies of the galaxy velocity dispersion function using large-scale spectroscopic surveys.",

We present ALMA QUARKS/ATOMS 1.3 mm/3 mm observations (the highest resolution $\\sim0.01$ pc) of a deeply embedded HC H II region (diameter $\\sim0.015$ pc, electron density $\\sim2\\times10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) exhibiting a striking $\\gtrsim20$ km s$^{-1}$ global redshift seen in optically thin H30$\\alpha$/H40$\\alpha$ recombination lines relative to its parental hot molecular core within a hub-filament system. The 1.3 mm continuum data reveal a distinct 0.1-pc arc and a perpendicular 0.04-pc tail. We propose that this morphology arises from a dynamic champagne flow: the slow expansion of HC H II region into a pre-existing filament forms the arc and associated low-velocity (few km s$^{-1}$) SiO shocks. Meanwhile, in the opposite direction ionized gas escapes along a steep density gradient traced by the tail and high-velocity (20 km s$^{-1}$) SiO emission. We reject the bow shock scenario in which ionized gas co-moves with a runaway high-mass star because shocked gas in the arc aligns with the hub velocity, contradicting the bow shock prediction. Non-LTE radiative transfer modeling further rules out infall of ionized gas as the velocity shift origin. We conclude that this exceptional HC H II region is undergoing a few-thousand-year transition phase of \"hatching out of the egg\": the ionized gas of HC H II region has just broken out of its parental hot core and now is flowing outward supersonically. This work highlights how anisotropic density distributions induce supersonically anisotropic ionized flows that govern HC H II region evolution.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We aim to investigate the interplay between dense molecular gas, star formation, and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in the luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) NGC 1068 at sub-kiloparsec scales. We present the HCN (4-3) and HCO$^+$ (4-3) maps of NGC 1068, obtained with JCMT as part of the Mapping the dense molecular gas in the strongest star-forming galaxies (MALATANG) project, and perform spatially resolved analyses of their correlations with infrared luminosity and soft X-ray emission. Spatially resolved relations between the luminosities of infrared dust emission and dense molecular gas tracers ($L_{\\rm IR}-L'_{\\rm dense}$) are found to be nearly linear, without clear evidence of excess contributions from AGN activity. The spatially resolved X-ray emission ($L^{\\rm gas}_{0.5-2\\,\\mathrm{keV}}$) displays a radially-dependent twofold correlation with the star formation rate (SFR), suggesting distinct gas-heating mechanisms between the galaxy center and the outer regions. A super-linear scaling is obtained in galactic center regions with SFR surface density ($\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$) $>$ 8.2 $\\times$ 10$^{-6}$ $M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$: log($L^{\\rm gas}_{0.5-2\\,\\mathrm{keV}}$/erg s$^{-1}$) = 2.2 log(SFR/$M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) + 39.1.

These findings indicate that AGN feedback does not dominate star formation regulation on sub-kiloparsec scales, and that the excitation of dense gas traced by HCN (4-3) may be more directly influenced by high-energy feedback processes compared to HCO$^+$ (4-3) and CO (3-2).",

Comments welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present the first spatially resolved investigation of near-infrared coronal lines in dwarf galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN), using JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy. Coronal lines (CLs), which are forbidden transitions from highly ionized species with ionization potentials up to 450 eV, act as sensitive tracers of the AGN ionizing continuum and feedback processes. Across four dwarf galaxies with ionized gas outflows traced by the optical [O III] lines, we report the detection of 16 unique species of near-infrared CLs. Line ratio diagnostics indicate that photoionization from the AGN dominates the excitation of CLs. We find that the coronal line region in dwarf galaxies, traced by the various CLs, extends up to 0.5 kpc, and can constitute up to 10% of their host galaxy size. Correlations between CL luminosities and [O III] ionized gas outflow properties are consistent with a scenario in which AGN-driven outflows likely facilitate the detection of CLs and contribute to their extent. Several CLs, including [Si VI], [Si VII], and [Mg VIII], exhibit a secondary broad component (W$_{80}$ > 300 km/s). If we interpret this spatially compact gas as part of an outflow, this would indicate that the outflowing gas includes a wide range of ionizations. The estimated energetics imply this highly ionized component is compact yet powerful enough to perturb gas in the central regions of the host dwarfs. These results indicate that AGN in low-mass galaxies may produce outflows capable of influencing their structure and evolution.",

While supernova remnants (SNRs) are observed to produce up to 1 M$_\\odot$ of dust, the amount of dust destroyed by the forward shock (FS) is poorly constrained, raising the question whether they are net dust producers or destroyers. Aims. We aim to estimate the dust destruction efficiency of SNR FSs in a realistically turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) during their most destructive phase, and assess dust shielding by high density filaments during this period. Methods. We run 3D turbulence simulations for different turbulent Mach numbers (0-3) and average ISM densities (1-100 cm$^{-3}$) to resemble observations of the turbulent ISM. We then set off a supernova to trace its 3D magnetohydrodynamical evolution for 10 kyr. Finally, we run post-processing simulations to study the dust transport and destruction by the SNR FS, considering gas and plasma drag, kinetic and thermal sputtering, and grain-grain collisions, and either silicate or carbonaceous dust. Results. The dust destruction rate of the FS strongly depends on the average ISM density and turbulence strength, varying between 27-92% (0.85-11.0 M$_\\odot$) in the studied 10 kyr. Overall, dust is less efficiently destroyed in a low density medium (1 cm$^{-3}$, 27-57%) than in intermediate (10 cm$^{-3}$, 46-92%) and high densities (100 cm$^{-3}$, 73-87%). The FS destroys 8-34% less dust in high Mach turbulence compared to a homogeneous medium. Furthermore, carbonaceous grains are more robust (up to 21% more) than silicates. Conclusions. Filaments can partly shield dust from destruction in the first 10 kyr, however, always more than 0.85 M$_\\odot$ of dust is destroyed, making most SNRs dust sinks under the conditions explored in this work. The destruction efficiency of the SNRs with less than 1 M$_\\odot$ of destroyed dust has not yet plateaued so that they are most likely also net dust destroyers by the end of their lifetime.",

Bakx Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The comoving cosmic star formation rate density peaks at z~2-3, with dusty star-forming galaxies being significant contributors to this peak. These galaxies are characterized by their high star formation rates and substantial infrared luminosities. The formation mechanisms remain an open question for these galaxies, particularly with respect to how such intense levels of star formation are triggered and maintained. We aim to resolve CO(3-2) emission toward two strongly lensed galaxies, SPT0125-47 and SPT2134-50, at z~2.5-2.8 to determine their morphology and physical properties. We used high-resolution ALMA band 3 observations of CO(3-2) emission toward both sources to investigate their properties. We performed parametric and nonparametric lens modeling using the publicly available lens modeling software PyAutoLens. We divided the CO(3-2) emission line into two bins corresponding to the red and blue portions of the emission line and nonparametrically modeled the source plane emission for both bins. We performed a basic analysis of the morphology and kinematics in the source plane using nonparametric lens modeling of the red and blue bins. We found tentative evidence of a velocity gradient across both sources and no evidence of any clumpy structure, companions, or ongoing mergers. The previously calculated high star formation rates and low depletion times of both SPT0125-47 and SPT2134-50 suggest that these galaxies are undergoing a dramatic phase in their evolution. Given the lack of evidence of ongoing interactions or mergers in our source plane models, we suggest that the intense star formation was triggered by a recent interaction and/or merger. We also consider the possibility that these galaxies might be in the process of settling into disks.",

Stark Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Determining the physical properties of galaxies during the first billion years after the big bang is key to understanding both early galaxy evolution and how galaxies contributed to the epoch of reionization. We present deep ALMA observations of the redshifted [OIII] 88um line for the gravitationally lensed ($\\mu = 11.4\\pm1.9$) galaxy A383-5.1 (z=6.027) that has previously been detected in [CII] 158um. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging identified this sub-L* galaxy as a ''Little Red Dot'' (LRD). With a line luminosity of $L_{\\rm [OIII]} = (1.29\\pm0.24)\\times10^8$ L$_\\odot$ (corrected for lensing magnification) A383-5.1 is one of the faintest galaxies with combined [CII] and [OIII] detections. The ALMA data reveal no dust continuum emission, consistent with previous observations. The high line luminosity ratio of [OIII]/[CII] $\\sim 14\\pm5$ is consistent with A383-5.1 being low-metallicity and dust-poor. The non-detection of dust continuum in bands 6 and 8 is consistent with the high [OIII]/[CII] ratio and suggests a presence of a strong ultraviolet radiation field, which would be less affect by dust attenuation, implying that galaxies of this type could contribute significantly to the ionization of the intergalactic medium. The presence of strong ionizing field could provide an important piece of information for understanding the nature of LRDs and their role in cosmic reionization.",

Despite its role as reference coeval stellar population, its multiplicity properties remain vaguely determined. The combined use of Gaia DR3 multiband photometry, astrometric parameter RUWE, non-single star solutions along with available ground-based spectroscopic, high angular resolution, and polarimetric observations enable more robust constraints on the binary star population in the cluster. Several conclusions may have broader implications for other stellar populations. Twin binaries, with mass ratio close to $q\\sim 1$, tend to have lower RUWE, increasing their membership selection probability, relative to $q\\sim 0.5$ systems that are disfavored. The frequently observed peak in mass ratio distribution for $q\\sim 1$ binaries may be partially attributed to this bias. Photometrically fitted mass ratio is underestimated for double-lined spectroscopic binaries in agreement with other authors. Differential extinction photometrically mimics stellar binarity. An area of enlarged absorption is traced by increased polarization south of the Merope star and excluded from the analysis to avoid this bias. The fraction of systems with $q>0.6$ companions is measured to be $f=16.4\\%^{+2.6}_{-0.6}$ for $m>0.5~M_\\odot$ stars, which is larger than recent Gaia-based estimates, but compatible with the pre-Gaia values for Pleiades and the field population. Binary fraction shows no steady increase with stellar mass in the 0.5 $-$ 1.2 $M_\\odot$ range, while mass ratio has a bimodal distribution with a minimum near $q\\sim 0.7$.",

Villar 27 pages, 15 figures, to be submitted to ApJ. Comments welcome Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is slated to observe nearly 20 billion galaxies during its decade-long Legacy Survey of Space and Time. The rich imaging data it collects will be an invaluable resource for probing galaxy evolution across cosmic time, characterizing the host galaxies of transient phenomena, and identifying novel populations of anomalous systems. While machine learning models have shown promise for extracting galaxy features from multi-band astronomical imaging, the large dimensionality of the learned latent space presents a challenge for mechanistic interpretability studies. In this work, we present Minuet, a low-dimensional diffusion autoencoder for multi-band galaxy imaging. Minuet is trained to reconstruct 72x72-pixel $grz$ image cutouts of 6M galaxies within $z<1$ from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey using only five latent dimensions. By using a diffusion model conditioned on the transformer-based autoencoder's output for image reconstruction, we achieve semantically-meaningful latent representations of galaxy images while still allowing for high-fidelity, probabilistic reconstructions. We train a series of binary classifiers on Minuet's latent features to quantify their connection to morphological labels from Galaxy Zoo, and a conditional flow to produce posterior distributions of SED-derived redshifts, stellar masses, and star-formation rates. We further show the value of Minuet for nearest neighbor searches in the learned latent space. Minuet provides strong evidence for the low intrinsic dimensionality of galaxy imaging, and introduces a class of astrophysical models that produce highly compact representations for diverse science goals.",

Our dataset comprises 670 distinct member stars, with a total of more than 2,000 observations collected over approximately one year. We constrain the binary fraction for UMi to be $0.61^{+0.16}_{-0.20}$ and $0.69^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$, with the binary orbital parameter distributions based on solar neighborhood observation from Duquennoy \\& Mayor (1991) and Moe \\& Di Stefano (2017), respectively. Furthermore, by dividing our data into two subsamples at the median metallicity, we identify that the binary fraction for the metal-rich ([Fe/H]>-2.14) population is slightly higher than that of the metal-poor ([Fe/H]<-2.14) population. Based on the Moe \\& Di Stefano model, the best-constrained binary fractions for metal-rich and metal-poor populations in UMi are $0.86^{+0.14}_{-0.24}$ and $0.48^{+0.26}_{-0.19}$, respectively. After a thorough examination, we find that this offset cannot be attributed to sample selection effects. We also divide our data into two subsamples according to their projected radius to the center of UMi, and find that the more centrally concentrated population in a denser environment has a lower binary fraction of $0.33^{+0.30}_{-0.20}$, compared with $1.00^{+0.00}_{-0.32}$ for the subsample in more outskirts.",

These spectra were carefully reduced, including rigorous absolute flux calibration, yielding detections of ~410-800 emission lines in each PN. Plasma diagnostics and abundance calculations were critically performed using nebular lines. In all three PNe, the electron temperatures derived using the collisionally excited lines (CELs) are higher than those yielded by the HI Balmer and Paschen jumps, while the temperatures yielded by the OII and NII optical recombination lines (ORLs) are very low, <2000 K, indicating that the heavy-element ORLs probe cold nebular regions. The ORL abundances of N, O and Ne are systematically higher than the corresponding CEL values, confirming high ADFs in the three objects. Position-velocity (PV) diagrams were created, and spatio-kinematical studies show that CELs come from the outer nebular regions, while the ORL-emitting regions are close to nebular center. Additionally, the velocity indicated by CEL line-splitting decreases with ionization potential, which was not obvious in ORLs. These spatial and kinematic differences support two distinct components of ionized gas: a cold, metal-rich component and a warmer component with normal metallicity. Heavy elements are strongly enriched in the cold gas, while its H^+ fraction is low but still produces significant HI emission, affecting CEL abundance estimates.",

Zhang, Satoshi Yamamoto Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The luminosity of embedded protostars is commonly measured via observations of the dust continuum spectral energy distribution from millimetre to infrared wavelengths. However, this method cannot be applied to embedded protostars in binary or multiple systems, where their components are usually unresolved over this extended wavelength range. We propose a new method, based on the idea that a molecule formed (mainly) on the grain surfaces only emits lines in the region where it thermally sublimates from the grain mantles, heated by the photons emitted by the embedded source. In this respect, carbonyl sulfide (OCS) is an optimal molecule, because of its low binding energy and rotational lines in the millimetre. We apply the method to the protobinary system NGC1333 IRAS4A, using ALMA high-spatial resolution ($\\sim$50 au) observations of the OCS(19-18) line as part of the ALMA Large Program FAUST. We also present new quantum mechanics calculations of the OCS binding energy distribution, essential for the application of the method. We found that the two binary components, A1 and A2, have a comparable luminosity within the error bars, 7.5$\\pm$2.5 and 7$\\pm$1 L$_\\odot$, respectively. We discuss the reliability of the estimated luminosities and the potential of this new method for measuring the luminosity of embedded protostars in binary and multiple systems.",

The properties of these velocity distributions govern the ISOs' propagation and dynamical evolution in the Galactic potential. We investigate how planetary system architecture influences ISO production during post-gas-disc dynamical instabilities using N-body simulations. We explore the ISO production outcomes of 2461 randomly generated systems spanning total system masses of 300-800 Earth masses and multiplicities of 3-7 planets. By integrating planets embedded in a disc of test particles for 10 Myr, we find that evolving systems can be broadly divided into two distinct classes based on their initial architectures. Catastrophic systems are characterized by high multiplicities and orbitally compact configurations, or by high-mass planets in systems with large mass asymmetries. These systems eject a large fraction of their planetesimals (median 59 percent) and, depending on the ejection pathway, produce high-speed ISOs (median 2.9 km/s). In contrast, quiet systems have lower masses and multiplicities and do not undergo significant orbital rearrangement, yet still eject a median of 28 percent of planetesimals at lower velocities (median 1.6 km/s). This dichotomy points to distinct ejection pathways, involving either violent global instabilities or more gradual, diffusive processes. Overall, we find that ISO ejection velocities are typically low, on the order of a few km/s. Although ISOs subsequently experience dynamical heating as they orbit the Galaxy, their velocity distributions retain signatures of their progenitor systems' architectures and histories, underscoring the potential use of ISOs in Galactic archaeology.",

In particularly we derive these for an elongated PSF, with a long and short axis, such as we would see from an instrument with a rectangular or elliptical mirror (relevant, for example, for the Gaia mission). We show that in this case the problem can be reduced to a one dimensional brightness profile with extrema along the line connecting the two sources, with an effective PSF width that depends on the relative orientation of the PSF and its degree of elongation. The problem can then be expressed in units of this effective width to be a function of the relative separation and light ratio alone (thus reducing to a rescaling of the un-elongated case). We derive the minimum light ratio, for a given separation and effective width, above which two sources will be resolved. We map out numerical procedures for finding the positions of these extrema across all possible cases. Finally we derive the positional offset and deviance associated with observing a fixed pair of blended sources from a variety of orientations, showing that this can be a significant source of excess noise.",

Holwerda Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 ML4PS workshop Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Estimating physical properties of galaxies from wide-field surveys remains a central challenge in astrophysics. While spectroscopy provides precise measurements, it is observationally expensive, and photometry discards morphological information that correlates with mass, star formation history, metallicity, and dust. We present a conditional flow matching (CFM) framework that leverages pixel-level imaging alongside photometry to improve posterior inference of galaxy properties. Using $\\sim10^5$ SDSS galaxies, we compare models trained on photometry alone versus photometry plus images. The image+photometry model outperforms the photometry-only model in posterior inference and more reliably recovers known scaling relations. Morphological information also helps mitigate the dust--age degeneracy. Our results highlight the potential of integrating morphology into photometric SED fitting pipelines, opening a pathway towards more accurate and physically informed constraints on galaxy properties.",

Buckley, David Shih 33 pages, 17 figures, 3 tables, minor typo correction Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We present a novel, data-driven analysis of Galactic dynamics, using unsupervised machine learning -- in the form of density estimation with normalizing flows -- to learn the underlying phase space distribution of 6 million nearby stars from the Gaia DR3 catalog. Solving the equilibrium collisionless Boltzmann equation, we calculate -- for the first time ever -- a model-free, unbinned estimate of the local acceleration and mass density fields within a 3 kpc sphere around the Sun. As our approach makes no assumptions about symmetries, we can test for signs of disequilibrium in our results. We find our results are consistent with equilibrium at the 10% level, limited by the current precision of the normalizing flows. After subtracting the known contribution of stars and gas from the calculated mass density, we find clear evidence for dark matter throughout the analyzed volume. Assuming spherical symmetry and averaging mass density measurements, we find a local dark matter density of $0.47\\pm 0.05$ GeV/cm$^3$. We compute the dark matter density at four radii in the stellar halo and fit to a generalized NFW profile. Although the uncertainties are large, we find a profile broadly consistent with recent analyses.",

Buckley Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) The Boltzmann equation relates the equilibrium phase space distribution of stars in the Milky Way to the Galaxy's gravitational potential. However, observations of stellar populations are biased by extinction from foreground dust, which complicates measurements of the potential in the disk and towards the Galactic center. Using the kinematics of Red Clump and Red Branch stars in Gaia DR3, we use machine learning to simultaneously estimate both the unbiased stellar phase space density and the gravitational potential. The unbiased phase space density is obtained through a learned \"dust efficiency factor\" -- an observational selection function that accounts for dust extinction. The potential and the dust efficiency are parameterized by fully connected neural networks and are completely data driven. We validate the dust efficiency using a recent three-dimensional dust map in this work, and examine the potential in a companion paper.",

Vollmer 7 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Context. Galaxies fly inside galaxy clusters and ram pressure by the ICM can remove a large amount of the ISM from the galaxy, and deposit the gas in the ICM. The ISM decoupled from the host galaxy leaves a long trail following the moving galaxy. Such long trails track the galaxy motion and can be detected with sensitive data in Halpha. Aims. We study the Halpha tail trailing NGC 4569 in the Virgo cluster. Methods. The initial discovery was made with the deep Halpha imaging data with CFHT, from the VESTIGE project. The follow-up spectroscopic observations were made with APO/DIS, MMT/Binospec and CFHT/SITELLE. Results. Besides the known 80 kpc Halpha tail downstream of NGC 4569, the deep Halpha imaging data allow the Halpha tail detected to at least 230 kpc from the galaxy. More importantly, the Halpha clumps implied from the imaging data are confirmed with the spectroscopic data. The Halpha clumps show a smooth radial velocity gradient across about 1300 km/s, eventually reaching the velocity of the cluster. Conclusions. This discovery, for the first time, demonstrates the full deceleration process of the stripped ISM. This discovery also showcases the potential with wide-field Halpha survey on galaxy clusters to discover intracluster optical emission-line clouds originated from cluster galaxies. These clouds provide kinematic tracers to the infall history of cluster galaxies and the turbulence in the ICM. They are also excellent multi-phase objects to study the classical cloud crushing problem and other relevant important physical processes.",

The arc is highly magnified by the Bullet Cluster (magnification factor ${\\mu}=14.0^{+6.2}_{-0.3}$. It contains three star-forming components of which one is barely resolved and two are unresolved, giving intrinsic sizes of $\\lesssim 10pc$. The clumps also contain ~50% of the total stellar mass. The galaxy formed the majority of its stars ~150Myr ago (by z~14). The spectrum shows a pronounced damping wing, typical for galaxies deep in the reionisation era and indicating a neutral IGM at this line of sight. The intrinsic luminosity of the galaxy is $0.086^{+0.008}_{-0.030} L^*$ (with $L^*$ being the characteristic luminosity for this redshift), making it the lowest luminosity spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at $z>10$ discovered to date.",

Nogueras-Lara Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The center of the Milky Way is a unique environment of great astrophysical interest, but its extreme crowding and extinction make it difficult to study. The GALACTICNUCLEUS survey, a high-angular-resolution near-infrared imaging program, was designed to overcome these challenges. We present the methodology and first results of its second data release, which includes major improvements in reduction, calibration, and analysis, providing deeper photometry, improved astrometry, and high-precision proper motions across the Nuclear Stellar Disk. Observations were obtained with VLT/HAWK-I in two epochs separated by seven years, using speckle holography and a ground-layer adaptive optics system. Proper motions were derived both relative, by aligning epochs within the survey, and absolute, by tying to the Gaia reference frame. The new release achieves photometry about one magnitude deeper and astrometry about ten times more precise than the first release. Proper motions reach an accuracy of about 0.5 mas/yr relative to Gaia. In the Arches field, our clustering analysis recovers the cluster with mean velocities consistent with HST-based results. The second data release of the GALACTICNUCLEUS survey provides the most precise ground-based proper motion catalogs of the Galactic Center to date, enabling studies of the Nuclear Stellar Disk, young star kinematics, and new stellar cluster detections.",

Windhorst 12 pages, 5 figures; V2: minor text corrections, figure added, submitted to journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We report the discovery of a doubly-imaged Little Red Dot (LRD) candidate behind the galaxy cluster Abell 383, which we dub A383-LRD1. Initially classified as a dropout galaxy in HST imaging with several ground-based emission line detections placing it at $z_{\\mathrm{spec}}=6.027$, new JWST/NIRCam observations taken as part of the cycle 4 VENUS survey now reveal that the source consists of two underlying components: A red point-source with a V-shaped SED consistent with LRD selection criteria, and a nearby ($\\sim 380$ pc) compact blue companion which was the main contributor to the previous rest-frame UV detections. Based on lensing symmetry and its SED, the LRD appears to lie at a similar redshift as well. The magnification of the two images of A383-LRD1 is $\\mu_{\\mathrm{A}}=16.2\\pm1.2$ and $\\mu_\\mathrm{B}=9.0\\pm0.6$, respectively, and the predicted time delay between them is $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{grav}}=5.20\\pm0.14$ yr ($\\sim0.7$ yr in the rest-frame). After correcting for the lensing magnification, we derive an absolute magnitude of $M_{\\mathrm{UV,LRD}}=-16.8\\pm 0.3$ for the LRD, and $M_{\\mathrm{UV,BC}}=-18.2\\pm 0.2$ for the blue companion. We perform SED fits to both components, revealing the LRD to be best fitted with a black hole star (BH*) model and a substantial host galaxy, and the blue companion with an extremely young, emission-line dominated star-forming nebula. A383-LRD1 represents the second known multiply-imaged LRD detected to date, following A2744-QSO1, and to our knowledge, the first LRD system with a confirmed detection of [C $_{II}$]$\\lambda158 \\ \\mu$m emission from ALMA observations. Thanks to lensing magnification, this system opens a unique door to study the relation between a LRD, its host galaxy, and its environment, and represents a prime candidate for deep JWST spectroscopy and high-resolution ALMA follow-up observations.",

Comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) JWST has revealed unexpectedly bright galaxies in the first 500 Myr after the Big Bang. Their overabundance suggests that they are preferentially observed during burst phases, where their star formation rates increase dramatically. In cosmological simulations, such bursts transition into short ($\\approx 40$ Myr) periods without star formation or naps. Using JWST/NIRCam medium-band observations, we report the discovery of the galaxy CANUCS-A370-2228423 ($z = 5.95 \\pm 0.06$, $\\log(M_\\ast/M_{\\odot}) = 9.14 \\pm 0.09$), dubbed The Sleeper. Its star formation history indicates rapid assembly in the first 300 Myr ($z \\gtrsim 14$), where it formed a $\\log(M_\\ast/M_{\\odot}) = 8.7^{+0.3}_{-0.4}\\ M_{\\odot}$ progenitor, comparable in stellar mass to the few spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at those redshifts. Unexpectedly, this is followed by several hundred million years of suppressed star formation, in stark contrast to nappers. This results in a remarkably strong hydrogen Balmer break, exceeding that of any galaxy observed within the first billion years by a factor of $\\approx 3$. Furthermore, Sleeper-like systems are overabundant in the observed survey volume compared to theory, as the probability of finding such galaxies in simulations is $< 0.2\\%$. The discovery of The Sleeper therefore disrupts the current narrative that all luminous galaxies in the first few hundred million years grow into massive descendants. Instead it presents an alternative evolutionary pathway in which these unusually luminous galaxies fade into inefficient dwarfs after an early starburst, revealing greater diversity in the first stages of galaxy evolution.",

Zhou, H. Zou Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate the properties of the cool circumgalactic medium (CGM) of massive galaxies and their cosmic evolution. By using the year 1 dataset of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and QSOs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey, we construct a sample of approximately 600,000 galaxy-quasar pairs and measure the radial distribution and kinematics of the cool gas traced by Mg II absorption lines as a function of galaxy properties from redshift 0.4 to redshift 1.2. Our results show that the covering fraction of the cool gas around LRGs increases with redshift, following a trend similar to the global evolution of galaxy star formation rate. At small radii (< 0.3rvir), the covering fraction anti-correlates with stellar mass, suggesting that mass-dependent processes suppress the cool gas content in the inner region. In addition, we measure the gas dispersion by modeling the velocity distribution of absorbers with a narrow and a broad components -- sigma_n ~ 160 and sigma_b ~ 380 km/s -- and quantify their relative contributions. The results show that the broad component becomes more prominent in the outer region, and its relative importance in the central region grows with increasing stellar mass. Finally, we discuss possible origins of the cool gas around massive galaxies, including the contribution of satellite galaxies and the precipitation scenario.",

Pinsonneault (OSU) 32 pages, 22 figures, matches version accepted by ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We focus on two key diagnostics of stellar physics in red giant branch (RGB) stars: the first dredge-up (FDU) of nuclear processed material and the location of the red giant branch bump (RGBB). We compare asteroseismic and spectroscopic APOKASC-3 data with theoretical MESA models. Our FDU predictions have similar mass and metallicity trends to the data, but the observed magnitude of the change in $[{\\rm C}/{\\rm N}]$ in data is smaller than theoretical predictions by $[0.1615 \\pm 0.0760 \\,({\\rm obs}) \\pm 0.0108 \\,({\\rm sys})] \\,{\\rm dex}$. These results are insensitive to the input physics, but they are at a level consistent with systematic uncertainties in the abundance measurements. When we include observed trends in birth $[{\\rm C}/{\\rm Fe}]$ and $[{\\rm N}/{\\rm Fe}]$ in our models, it modestly increases the metallicity dependent difference relative to the data. We find a well-defined empirical RGBB locus: $\\log g = 2.6604 - 0.1832 (M/{\\rm M}_\\odot-1) + 0.2824 \\,[{\\rm Fe}/{\\rm H}]$.

Carrera accepted for publication on A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The accurate determination of chemical abundances in stars plays a pivotal role in understanding stellar structure and evolution, nucleosynthesis, and the chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way. Benchmark stars with precise and accurate atmospheric parameters and abundances are indispensable for calibrating spectroscopic surveys and testing stellar atmosphere models. This study focuses on the compilation of high-quality spectra and the determination of LTE chemical abundances of iron-peak and $\\alpha$ elements for the third version of the Gaia FGK Benchmark Stars (GBSv3). We compiled spectra of the GBSv3 from public archives and complemented these with our own observations. We use fundamental atmospheric parameters from Soubiran et al. 2024 to derive the chemical abundances and perform a spectroscopic analysis using the public code iSpec. We compile a homogeneous spectral library of high-resolution (42,000) and high signal-to-noise ($>100$) normalised spectra for 202 stars: including the 192 GBSv3, 9 stars with indirect measurement of the angular diameter from previous GBS versions, and the Sun. Using four radiative transfer codes, we derive chemical abundances of 13 chemical species (Fe I, Fe II, Mg I, Si I, Ca I, Ti I, Ti II, Sc II, V I, Cr I, Mn I, Co I, Ni I). We make an in-depth study of several sources of error. The GBSv3 contributes to the legacy samples of spectroscopic reference stars with improved statistics and homogeneity. This work offers the community a homogeneous spectral library and robust reference abundances for iron-peak and $\\alpha$ elements, supported by an extensive analysis of the associated uncertainties.",

Tovmassian Accepted for publication in A&A, 12 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) AM Canum Venaticorum (AM CVn) stars are ultra-compact binary systems composed of a white dwarf (WD) primary accreting from a H-deficient donor. They are important as potential progenitors of Type Ia supernovae and laboratories for gravitational-wave studies, yet their evolutionary history remains unsolved. Three formation channels have been proposed: the WD channel, the He-star channel, and the cataclysmic variable (CV) channel. We aim to provide the first accurate measurements of the fundamental parameters of the accretor in ZTFJ225237.05-051917.4, including the abundances of key elements such as C, N, and Si, by analysing UV spectra obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. These measurements provide new insight into the system's evolutionary history and establish it as a benchmark to develop our pipeline for application to a larger sample of AM CVns. We determine the binary parameters from photometric modelling and constrain the atmospheric parameters of the WD accretor, including Teff, logg, and chemical abundances, by fitting the UV spectrum with synthetic spectral models. We then infer the system's formation channel by comparing our results with theoretical evolutionary models. We measure a Teff=23300$\\pm$600K and a surface gravity of logg=8.4$\\pm$0.3, which implies an accretor mass of 0.86$\\pm$0.16 solar masses. We find a high N/C abundance ratio by mass of >153. The accretor is significantly hotter than previous estimates based on simplified blackbody fits to the spectral energy distribution, underscoring the importance of detailed spectral modelling for determining accurate system parameters. Our results show that UV spectroscopy is well-suited to constraining the formation channels of AM CVn systems. We conclude that the He-star channel can be excluded based on the high N/C ratio, while the WD and CV channels remain consistent with the observations.",

The impact of the CME was clearly identifiable in the spacecraft signal SNR, Doppler noise and phase residuals observed at the University of Tasmania's Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) antenna in Ceduna, South Australia. The residual phases observed from the spacecraft were highly correlated with each other during the transit of the CME across the radio ray-path despite the spacecraft signals having substantially different Doppler trends. We analyse the auto- and cross-correlations between the spacecraft phase residuals, finding time-lags ranging between 3.18-14.43 seconds depending on whether the imprinted fluctuations were stronger on the uplink or the downlink radio ray-paths. We also examine the temporal evolution of the phase fluctuations to probe the finer structure of the CME and demonstrate that there was a clear difference in the turbulence regime of the CME leading edge and the background solar wind conditions several hours prior to the CME radio occultation. Finally, autocorrelation of the MEX two-way radio Doppler noise data from Ceduna and closed-loop Doppler data from ESA's New Norcia ground station antenna were used to constrain the location of the CME impact along the radio ray-path \\add{to a region 0.2 AU from the Sun, at a heliospheric longitude consistent with CME origin at the Sun.

Benkő 4 pages + 5 pages appendix, accepted for publication in A&A Letters Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Recent studies have shown that the irregular O-C variations observed in many non-Blazhko RR Lyrae stars may result from random, cycle-to-cycle (C2C) variations in their light curves. However, centuries-long data series reveal that the O-C diagrams of Blazhko stars exhibit particularly large-amplitude, irregular variations. In this Letter, we extend the previous investigation of non-Blazhko stars to Kepler Blazhko stars to explore the role of C2C variations in the O-C diagrams. We derived the O-C diagrams from Kepler space telescope light curves using a precise template-fitting method. Based on their Fourier analyses, we also constructed residual O-C diagrams that were pre-whitened for frequencies associated with the Blazhko effect. We then fitted the same statistical models to both types of O-Cs that we had previously applied to non-Blazhko stars. The optimal statistical model includes the C2C variation for 74% of the O-C curves in our Blazhko sample, and the parameter describing the strength of the C2C variation is significantly larger than that obtained for non-Blazhko stars. This may explain the strong irregular O-C variations previously observed in Blazhko stars. Furthermore, we found a strong positive correlation between the C2C variation strength and the amplitude of the frequency-modulation component of the Blazhko effect, indicating a connection between the two phenomena.",

Bale, Daniel Heyner 14 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, submitted to ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) A central question for understanding interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) physics and improving space weather forecasting is how ICMEs evolve in interplanetary space. We have updated one of the most comprehensive in situ ICME catalogs to date, which now includes 1976 events from 11 space missions covering over 34 years, from December 1990 to August 2025. We have combined existing catalogs including magnetic obstacles and identified and added boundaries of an additional 807 (40.8%) events ourselves. With this catalog, we demonstrate the most extensive analysis to date of total ICME magnetic field values as a function of heliocentric distance. Parker Solar Probe has observed 6 ICMEs at $< 0.23$ au (until April 2025), and Solar Orbiter and BepiColombo have added more events near 0.3~au, bridging the major observational gap towards the solar corona. Our main result is that a single power law can describe the evolution of the mean total magnetic field (exponent value of $k=-1.57$) and maximum field ($k=-1.53$) in the magnetic obstacle (MO), from 0.07 to 5.4 au. Extending the power law to the solar photosphere reveals a strong inconsistency with magnetic field magnitudes observed in the quiet Sun and active regions by 2 and 4 orders of magnitude, respectively. We introduce a multipole-type power law with two exponents, $k_1=-1.57$, and $k_2=-6$, relating the ICME magnetic field magnitude to an average solar active region field strength. These results present important observational constraints for the evolution of ICMEs from the Sun to the heliosphere.",

Unlike previously discovered X-ray BH binaries, this type of dBH-LC has relatively long orbital periods (typically more than several tens to a few hundred days) and shows very weak X-ray emission. Therefore, studying the formation and evolution of the whole dBH-LC population is also a very interesting problem. Our aim is to study the contribution of massive stars to the dBH-LC population under different evolutionary models (isolated binary evolution (IBE) and hierarchical triple evolution), and different formation channels (such as mass transfer, common envelope evolution). Using the Massive Objects in Binary Stellar Evolution (MOBSE) code, the Triple Stellar Evolution (TSE) code, and the latest initial multiple-star distributions, we model the populations of massive stars. Finally, we calculate the orbital properties, mass distributions, and birthrates of the BH-LC populations formed under these different conditions. In the Milky Way, we calculate that the birthrate of dBH-LC formed through IBE is about 4.35$\\times$$10^{-5}$ ${\\rm yr}^{-1}$, while the birthrate through triple evolution is about 1.47$\\times$$10^{-3}$ ${\\rm yr}^{-1}$. This means that the birthrate from triple evolution is one to two orders of magnitude higher than that from IBE. We find that in triple evolution, the main formation channel of dBH-LC is post-merger binaries formed from inner binary mergers triggered by von Zeipel$-$Lidov$-$Kozai oscillations.",

To be published in A&A Letters to the Editor Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) High-energy irradiation in X-rays and UV (XUV) can transform the planetary atmospheres through photoevaporation and photochemistry. This is more crucial for M stars, whose habitable zones for Earth-like planets are located within a few percent of an AU. Transiting exoplanets around M dwarfs offer the opportunity to study their characteristics and habitability conditions. L 98-59 is an M3 dwarf hosting six Earth-like planets, with two of them in the habitable zone of the star. X-ray observations made in 2020 and 2021 detected significant flares above a quiescent luminosity of 4-10 x 10^26 erg/s. We present the results from two short XMM-Newton observations of L 98-59, which are part of a monitoring survey to detect long-term X-ray variability and activity cycles. In October 2024 the X-ray quiescent luminosity of the star was about 5.9 x 10^25 erg/s, and it was about 6.3 x 10^26 erg/s in February 2025. We speculate that in late 2024 the star had a minimum of activity; in 2021 the star was near a maximum of an activity cycle, and in 2025 it was at the middle of the cycle. We suggest a coarse estimate of the period of about 2 years and a peak-to-peak amplitude of about 10, which is the highest among the stars with a known X-ray cycle other than the Sun. We also infer that even the outer planet in the habitable zone, L 98-59f, is exposed to an X-ray dose between 100 and 1600 times the X-ray irradiation of the Earth in the XMM band.",

Althaus 11 pages, 9 figures. Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) During the evolution of stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), thermal pulses lead to the formation of strongly stratified layers in the outer regions of the CO core, which might lead to inversions in the chemical gradient. Such inversions would produce instabilities beyond the ones predicted by the Schwarzschild criterion and the standard use of mixing length theory (MLT). We used a set of MLT equations that consider the impact of the background chemical gradients. This extension of MLT is referred to in this work as MLT$\\sharp$, to make a distinction between both prescriptions. We applied MLT$\\sharp$ in tandem with the more general Ledoux instability criterion. We computed the evolution in the AGB phase and compared the chemical profiles resulting from MLT, MLT$\\sharp$ and the double diffusive GNA theory. We continued the evolution through a post-AGB thermal pulse and performed a pulsational analysis of the resultant GW Vir models to asses $g$-mode pulsation periods. Finally, we tested our results with pulsation properties of known GW Vir stars derived from recent observations. We find that the much simpler MLT$\\sharp$ set of equations closely reproduces the results from the GNA theory. As such, MLT$\\sharp$ offers a simple way to include chemically driven convection in stellar evolution computations. Stellar evolution simulations show that Rayleigh-Taylor and thermohaline instabilities can play an important role during the TP-AGB. We obtained significantly different chemical profiles using a standard MLT approach compared to those resulting from our MLT$\\sharp$ and GNA computations. Our adiabatic pulsational analysis shows that these differences in the chemical stratification leave clear mode-trapping signatures in the pulsation spectrum of the GW Vir models.",

Jackson 14 pages, 6 figures, accepted by A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Giant impacts between planetary embryos are a natural step in the terrestrial planet formation process and are expected to create disks of warm debris in the terrestrial regions of their stars. Understanding the gas and dust debris produced in giant impacts is vital for comprehending and constraining models of planetary collisions. We reveal the distribution of millimeter grains in the giant impact debris disk of HD 172555 for the first time, using new ALMA 0.87 mm observations at $\\sim$80 mas (2.3 au) resolution. We modeled the interferometric visibilities to obtain basic spatial properties of the disk, and compared it to the disk's dust and gas distributions at other wavelengths. We detect the star and dust emission from an inclined disk out to $\\sim$9 au and down to 2.3 au (on-sky) from the central star, with no significant asymmetry in the dust distribution. Radiative transfer modeling of the visibilities indicates the disk surface density distribution of millimeter grains most likely peaks around $\\sim$5 au, while the width inferred remains model-dependent at the S/N of the data. We highlight an outward radial offset of the small grains traced by scattered light observations compared to the millimeter grains, which could be explained by the combined effect of gas drag and radiation pressure in the presence of large enough gas densities. Furthermore, SED modeling implies a size distribution slope for the millimeter grains consistent with the expectation of collisional evolution and flatter than inferred for the micron-sized grains, implying a break in the grain size distribution and confirming an overabundance of small grains.",

The cloud code Virga is capable of quickly modeling cloud particle sizes as a function of altitude, and has recently been updated to include functionality for aggregates (ranging from very fluffy chains to compact fractals). We analyze the effect that these aggregates have on transmission spectra for typical warm Neptune and hot Jupiter environments, as well as their effect on emission spectra for an L-type brown dwarf, over the wavelength range 0.3 - 15 um. We find significant, measurable differences in spectra when particle shape is changed (particularly the shortest wavelengths where particle morphology strongly affects the scattering slope). We provide some intuitive rules for how non-absorbing aggregates impact spectra: when particle sizes are small compared to the wavelength of light, the most elongated and chain-like particles have the highest opacities. When particles are large, the inverse is true (the most compact shapes have the highest opacities). We present an explanation for these effects in terms of the dynamics of how the particles form and move through the atmosphere, as well as in terms of fundamental optics theory. Given the significant impact that particle shape can have on spectra, we strongly encourage the community to include shape as a free parameter in future case studies, atmospheric models, and retrievals.",

Shapiro, Jake Taylor, Louis-Philippe Coulombe, Olivia Lim, David Lafreniere 16 pages, 8 figures, published in ApJ Letters Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Although TRAPPIST-1's temperate planets have the highest transmission signals of any known system, flares contaminate 50-70% of transits at the 1000 ppm level, far above 100 ppm secondary atmospheres. Efforts to mitigate flare contamination and assess impacts on radiation environments are each hampered by a lack of empirical spectral analysis and physics-based modeling. We present spectrotemporal analysis and radiative-hydrodynamic modeling of 5.5 hr of NIRISS and NIRSpec observations of 6 TRAPPIST-1 flares of 2.2-8.7x10^30 erg. Flare lines and continua are characterized using grid searches of RADYN beam-heating models spanning 10$^4\\times$ in electron beam parameters. Best-fit models indicate these flares result from moderate-intensity beams with emergent electron fluxes of 10^12 erg s^-1 cm^-2 and energies $\\leq$37 keV, although all models over-predict the Paschen jump. These models predict XUV, FUV, and NUV counterparts to the infrared peak fluxes of 8.9-28.9x10^27, 4.3-13.9x10^26, and 3.4-11.4x10^27 erg s^-1, respectively. Scaling the flare rate into the XUV suggests flaring contributes 1.35$_{-0.15}^{+2.0}\\times$ quiescence yr$^{-1}$. We bin integrations of similar flare effective temperature to construct fiducial flare spectra from 2000-4500 K in order to develop separate empirical and RADYN-based mitigation pipelines. Both pipelines are applied to all 5.5 hr of R=10 data, resulting in maximum residuals from 1-2.8$\\mu$m of 100-140 ppm and typical residuals of 54$\\pm$14 and 65$\\pm$17 ppm for the empirical and RADYN-based pipelines, respectively. Injection testing supports 3$\\sigma$ detection capability for CO2 atmospheres with features of 150-250 ppm, with weak evidence (BF$\\approx$3) still obtained at 130 ppm. Our results motivate multi-wavelength observations to improve model fidelity and test high-energy predictions.",

Using high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise ratio spectra from the ESO and Keck archives, we perform a strict line-by-line differential analysis relative to the Sun to derive stellar parameters and abundances of 19 elements from C to Zn. The stars span effective temperatures of 4500-6500 K and metallicities from -0.57 to +0.50 dex. The sample includes hosts of both gas giants and terrestrial planets, allowing direct comparison between stellar composition and planetary properties. Several of the giant planets orbit metal-rich stars. The detailed abundance patterns show clear chemical diversity, including carbon-enhanced but mildly metal-poor stars (TOI-824, TOI-1130, GJ 9827) and $\\alpha$-enhanced metal-poor stars (TOI-561, GJ 9827, TOI-824). These variations trace differences in protoplanetary disk composition and may influence planetary interiors and atmospheric chemistry. The planet-hosts show a range of [C/O] ratios, and the diverse [Mg/Si] ratios may suggest varied interior compositions for their rocky planets. This homogeneous stellar abundance, together with future uniform JWST planetary atmosphere measurements, provides a foundation for exploring the planet mass-metallicity relation and the connection between stellar chemistry and planetary formation pathways. These results constitute the first step in a larger survey spanning multiple JWST cycles to systematically examine how host star composition shapes exoplanetary systems.",

Zingales 16 pages, 20 figures, accepted for publication on A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The transition regime between giant planets (GPs) and brown dwarfs (BDs) is still an open subject of study in exoplanetary science. A complete understanding of the population of long-period GPs and BDs would be pivotal in understanding this topic, but the number of such objects with precisely measured orbital and physical parameters is still small. Moreover, their dynamical influence on smaller companions in inner orbits is still unclear. Within the GAPS programme, we aim to confirm and characterize sub-stellar companion candidates from Gaia DR3, and to study the potential presence of additional lower-mass planets in their systems. We present the results of an intensive high-precision RV monitoring of HD 128717, which hosts the astrometric candidate Gaia-ASOI-009. We used the HARPS-N spectrograph at TNG to collect a high-cadence RV time series of the target. We used MCMC analyses to refine the Gaia DR3 orbital solution of the companion and, finally, performed a combined model of RV and proper motion anomaly (PMa) to derive the complete 3-D orbit of the companion. We also ran a suite of numerical simulations to confirm our results. We confirm the sub-stellar nature of Gaia-ASOI-009, i.e. Gaia-6 B: from the combined RV+PMa fit, we confirm that it is a high-eccentricity low-mass brown dwarf with $P_\\text{B} = 9.37^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ yr, $M_\\text{B} = 19.8 \\pm 0.5$ $M_\\text{J}$, $e_\\text{B}=0.85$, $i_\\text{B} = 130^{\\circ}$. The derived orbital solution differs significantly from the one published in Gaia DR3. Through a series of dedicated simulations, we demonstrate that this discrepancy arises from a degeneracy in the Gaia DR3 astrometric solution. Specifically, the combination of Gaia-6 B long orbital period and high eccentricity, both poorly constrained by the limited timespan of DR3, led to an incorrect solution characterized by a shorter period and lower eccentricity.",

Studies suggest a presence of strong azimuthal wave motions on the timescale of centuries within the Earth's liquid outer core at higher latitudes. To understand these long-period oscillations, we focus on magnetostrophic waves, a slow component of magnetic-Coriolis waves with $\\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned with the rotation vector $\\bf{\\Omega}$, which replicate the field lines in the azimuthal direction. We present an analytical solution to the magnetic-Coriolis wave equation in Cartesian coordinates. Later, with numerical solution, we validate our analytical estimates and show that magnetostrophic waves travel relatively faster along the magnetic field when $\\bf{B} \\perp \\bf{\\Omega}$ compared with the case when both are aligned. The study confirms that with a magnetic field $\\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned to the rotation vector $\\bf{\\Omega}$, wave vectors satisfying the condition $\\bf{\\Omega}\\cdot\\bf{k} \\approx 0$, travel with Alfvén velocities along the magnetic field lines as a component of inertial-Alfvén waves. The timescales on which Alfvén waves travel are relatively short, and it is also less likely that inertial-Alfvén waves will be sustained inside the core at higher latitudes \\citep{Davidson2017}. This study shows that, excluding the inertial-Alfvén waves contribution ($k_z\\neq 0$), there exists intensified magnetostrophic wave propagation when $\\bf{B} \\perp \\bf{\\Omega}$, which can explain the strong periodic oscillations on the time scales of centuries along the azimuthal field at higher latitudes.

All models are trained and validated under consistent data splits and evaluation criteria, with the goal of assessing the strengths and limitations of transformer backbones across spatial and temporal representations of solar activity. We investigate multiple loss formulations (weighted BCE, focal, and score-oriented) and training balance strategies to mitigate class imbalance typical of flare datasets. Results show that while both SigLIP2 and VideoMAE achieve typical performance on image and video data (True Skill Statistic TSS~0.60-0.65), the time-series model Moirai2 reaches superior forecasting skill (TSS~0.74) using irradiance-based temporal evolution alone.

      "abstract": "A review on fundamental bounds and estimators for photometry and astrometry of celestial point sources using array detectors, from first principles Sebastián Espinosa, Rene A. Mendez, Jorge F. Silva, Marcos Orchard Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Precise astrometric and photometric measurements of celestial point sources are fundamental to modern astronomy. These measurements, used to determine object positions, motions, and fluxes, are based on observational models that have evolved from empirical centroiding rules to rigorous probabilistic formulations at the pixel level. This review summarizes key contributions that formalized this transition and analyzes seminal works addressing both the theoretical limits and the empirical performance of estimators. Central to these developments is the derivation of fundamental bounds, such as the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB), and the assessment of widely used estimators, including Maximum Likelihood (ML), Least Squares (LS), and Weighted Least Squares (WLS). These studies show that, while the CRLB sets a theoretical benchmark, practical estimators achieve it only under specific signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes, with notable discrepancies in high-SNR conditions. Moreover, recent results demonstrate that jointly estimating source flux and background significantly improves photometric precision compared to sequential approaches. Looking ahead, the increasing complexity of astronomical surveys, driven by massive data volumes, dynamic observational conditions, and the integration of machine learning, poses new challenges to reliable inference. In this context, tools from statistical theory, including performance bounds and theoretically grounded estimators, remain critical to guide algorithm design and ensure robust astrometric and photometric pipelines.",

The filters with different spectral transmittance can be cut into the optical path at different times by this mechanism. Because the image contrast of space coronagraph is very high, the high stability requirement for the optical unit of coronagraph is put forward. Small modulus worm gear and worm are taken by the mechanism, in order to realize compact structure, high stiffness, the unidirectional 360 degrees rotation and reverse self-locking function. The precision, stiffness, mechanical properties and reliability of the mechanism are analyzed in the paper. The results show that the position accuracy of the filter wheel can meet the requirement of 0.5mm. The first order modal of the mechanism is 313Hz. The results of vibration test indicate that stiffness, dynamic performance and reliability of the mechanism can be meet. Therefore, the design of filter wheel in this paper can ensure the multi-spectral imaging requirements under complex spatial conditions.",

Enßlin, Lukas Heinrich Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Modern radio interferometers deliver large volumes of data containing high-sensitivity sky maps over wide fields-of-view. These large area observations can contain various and superposed structures such as point sources, extended objects, and large-scale diffuse emission. To fully realize the potential of these observations, it is crucial to build appropriate sky emission models which separate and reconstruct the underlying astrophysical components. We introduce aim-resolve, an automatic and iterative method that combines the Bayesian imaging algorithm resolve with deep learning and clustering algorithms in order to jointly solve the reconstruction and source extraction problem. The method identifies and models different astrophysical components in radio observations while providing uncertainty quantification of the results. By using different model descriptions for point sources, extended objects, and diffuse background emission, the method efficiently separates the individual components and improves the overall reconstruction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on synthetic image data containing multiple different sources. We further show the application of aim-resolve to an L-band (856 - 1712 MHz) MeerKAT observation of the radio galaxy ESO 137-006 and other radio galaxies in that environment. We observe a reasonable object identification for both applications, yielding a clean separation of the individual components and precise reconstructions of point sources and extended objects along with detailed uncertainty quantification. In particular, the method enables the creation of catalogs containing source positions and brightnesses and the corresponding uncertainties. The full decoupling of sky emission model and instrument response makes the method applicable to a wide variety of instruments or wavelength bands.",

Here, we employ a Michelson Interferometer in conjunction with a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) for determining the spectral profile of a narrow-band light source. Interestingly, we observe that the fringes across the interferometer output beam are inherently shifted in wavelength even when a constant phase profile is provided to the SLM. We calibrate the spectral shifts as a function of fringe spatial location by measuring the incident light spectrum at various points across the fringe pattern, and observe that the spectral peak traces out a `teardrop' shape, whose width is dependent on the spectral bandwidth of the source, the relative tilt and path difference between the two arms of the interferometer, and the divergence of the beam. Next, we demonstrate that this inherent spectral variation of the fringes can be used to perform fast single-snapshot spectroscopy of narrow-band light sources, while a time-varied phase profile provided to the SLM leads to multi-step spectroscopy with lower noise, higher resolution, and better contrast. Our findings establish that the Michelson Interferometer can be used to perform spectroscopy of any source within a certain spectral range from simple images of the fringe pattern, so as to facilitate exciting applications towards hyperspectral imaging.",

It reviews astrophysical and cosmological evidence, highlights the Standard Model's limitations, and motivates searches for WIMPs, axions, and dark photons through direct, indirect, and collider-based strategies. The experimental work includes the Micromegas-based TREX-DM experiment for low-mass WIMPs, with studies of argon and neon-based gas mixtures, detector design, shielding, readout, and background suppression. GEM integration boosted gain by up to 45. A UV LED-based internal calibration system was developed for compact, low-background operation, while pressure-dependent gain studies optimized future low-background TPCs. The thesis also advances axion and dark photon searches via haloscopes and introduces the DarkQuantum prototype, a superconducting qubit coupled to microwave cavities for single-photon detection. This system enabled the most stringent exclusion limit on massive dark photon interactions at 5.051 GHz, demonstrating the feasibility of quantum-enhanced detectors.

Yan Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We aim to study the atmospheric properties of the warm Neptune GJ 436 b by combining a set of five transit events observed with the CARMENES spectrograph with one transit from CRIRES$^+$ so as to provide the most constrained results possible at high resolution. We removed telluric and stellar signals from the data using SysRem and potential planetary signals were investigated using the cross-correlation technique. Following standard procedures for undetected species, we performed injection recovery tests and Bayesian retrievals to place constraints on the detectability of the main near-infrared absorbers. In addition, we simulated ELT/ANDES observations by computing end-to-end in silico datasets with EXoPLORE. No molecular signals were detected in the atmosphere of GJ 436 b, which is consistent with previous studies. Combined CARMENES-CRIRES$^+$ injection-recovery and Bayesian retrieval analyses show that the atmosphere is likely covered by high-altitude clouds ($\\sim$ $1$ mbar) at low and intermediate metallicities or, alternatively, is very metal-rich ($\\gtrsim$ $900\\times$ solar), which would suppress spectral features without invoking clouds. Simulations of ELT/ANDES observations suggest a boost by nearly an order of magnitude to the upper limit in the photon-limited regime, reaching $0.1$ mbar at $10$-$300\\times$ solar metallicities. The joint analysis of all useful transit observations from CARMENES and CRIRES$^+$ provides the most stringent constraints to date on the atmospheric properties of GJ 436 b. Complementary CCF-based and retrieval approaches consistently indicate that the atmosphere is either cloudy or highly metal enriched. Any weak near-infrared absorption lines, if present, are likely to be below current detection limits. However, according to our simulations, these features may be revealed with ELT/ANDES even in single-transit observations.",

Ciesla, Eric Van Clepper, Jennifer Bergner, Edwin Bergin Accepted for Publication in the Astronomical Journal (15 pages, 12 figures) Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Observations have revealed evidence of photochemical processing in protoplanetary disks. This processing occurs in the photon dominated layer, the optically thin regions of the disk high above the disk midplane. It remains unclear, however, how much this photochemical processing impacts the compositions of the planets and their building blocks within the disk. Here we use the oxygen isotopic compositions of Solar System solids, which has been attributed to photochemistry in the solar nebula, to quantitatively evaluate whether this processing could have produced the conditions needed to provide the diversity of compositions seen in the Solar System. We do this by modeling the chemical evolution while fine dust grows into the building blocks of the planets. We find that the oxygen isotopic evolution cannot be attributed to processing in the solar nebula and must instead be inherited from the parent molecular cloud. Further, our results indicate that the observed photochemical processing in protoplanetary disks does not significantly impact the compositions of planets that form within.",

Latter, Geoffroy Lesur Mon Not R Astron Soc (2025) 1284-1303 Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The inner regions of protoplanetary discs, which encompass the putative habitable zone, are dynamically complex, featuring a well-ionised, turbulent active inner region and a poorly ionised `dead' outer region. In this first paper, we investigate a base-level model of the magnetohydrodynamic processes around the interface between these two regions, using five three-dimensional global magnetohydrodynamic simulations in the zero-net flux regime. We employ physically motivated profiles for Ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion, alongside a simplified thermodynamic model comprising a cool disc and hot corona. Our results show that, first, large-scale coherent poloidal magnetic field loops form in the magnetorotational instability active region. These loops lead to the accumulation of tightly wound magnetic flux at the disc-corona temperature transition, driving strong, localised accretion flows in the surface layers of the active region. Second, an axisymmetric pressure maximum, extending across multiple disc scale heights, develops as a result of outward mass transport from the active region. This, in turn, triggers the Rossby wave instability and leads to the development of anticyclonic vortices. Third, the dead zone develops magnetic field with a distinct morphology, likely resulting from the outward diffusion of the large-scale poloidal loops in the active zone. This self-consistently generated field exhibits a vertical structure that can drive accretion in the inner dead zone via a weak magnetic-pressure wind. In the second paper in the series, we extend this work to the vertical-net flux regime, where global magnetic flux transport and magnetically driven outflows become dynamically significant.",

Emery, Estela Fernández-Valenzuela, Noemí Pinilla-Alonso 12 pages, 5 figures. Published in PSJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We present observations of the midsized Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) Salacia$-$Actaea and Máni, obtained with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph on JWST. The satellite Actaea was fully blended with Salacia at the spatial resolution of the integral field unit, and we extracted the combined spectrum. The 0.7$-$5.1 $\\mu$m reflectance spectra of Salacia$-$Actaea and Máni display prominent water-ice absorption bands at 1.5, 2, 3, and 4$-$5 $\\mu$m. The $\\nu_{3}$ fundamental vibrational band of carbon dioxide ice at 4.25 $\\mu$m is present in both spectra. From a quantitative band-depth analysis of the entire current JWST spectroscopic sample of water-ice-rich KBOs, we find strong evidence for a positive covariance between relative water-ice abundance and size, which may indicate the emergent impacts of internal differentiation and cryovolcanic production of surface water ice on midsized KBOs. A detailed look at the distribution of 2 and 3 $\\mu$m band depths suggests additional sources of variability, such as different water-ice grain sizes. In addition, we report an apparent transition in the carbon dioxide band depth at object diameters of roughly 300$-$500 km, with larger objects showing systematically weaker absorptions, although selection effects within the sample do not allow us to confidently distinguish between a size-dependent phenomenon and a correlation with dynamical class.",

      "abstract": "Silane-Methane Competition in Sub-Neptune Atmospheres as a Diagnostic of Metallicity and Magma Oceans Kaustubh Hakim, Dan J. Bower, Fabian L. Seidler, Paolo A. Sossi 16 pages, 16 figures, revised version Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The James Webb Space Telescope is characterising the atmospheres of sub-Neptunes. The presence of magma oceans on sub-Neptunes is expected to strongly alter the chemistry of their envelopes and observable atmospheres. At the magma ocean-envelope boundary (MEB, $>$10 kbar), gas properties deviate from ideality, yet the effects of real gas behaviour on chemical equilibria remain underexplored. Here, we compute equilibrium between magma-gas and gas-gas reactions using real gas equations of state in the H-He-C-N-O-Si system for TOI-421b, a canonical hot sub-Neptune potentially hosting a magma ocean. We find that H and N are the most soluble in magma, followed by He and C. We fit real gas equations of state to experimental data on SiH$_4$, and show that, for a fully molten mantle, SiH$_4$ dominates at the MEB under accreted gas metallicity of 1$\\times$ solar, but is supplanted by CH$_4$ at 100$\\times$ solar. Lower mantle melt fractions lower both magma-derived Si abundances in the envelope and the solubility of H and He in magma, yielding H$_2$- and He-rich envelopes. Projecting equilibrium chemistry through the observable atmosphere (1 mbar-100 bar), we find that `clouds' of Si-bearing condensates strongly deplete Si-bearing gases, although SiH$_4$ remains key, especially when a solar gas is accreted. SiH$_4$/CH$_4$ and Si/C ratios increase with mantle melt fraction and decrease with accreted gas metallicity. The competition between SiH$_4$ and CH$_4$ is therefore diagnostic of metallicity and presence of magma oceans on sub-Neptunes with equilibrium temperatures below 1000 K. The corollary is that H$_2$- and He-rich, SiH$_4$-deficient and CH$_4$-bearing observable atmospheres may indicate a limited role or absence of magma oceans on sub-Neptunes.",

Accepted by Advances in Space Research (in press). First two authors contributed equally Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD) Understanding the dynamical structure of cislunar space beyond geosynchronous orbit is critical for both lunar exploration and for high-Earth-orbiting trajectories. In this study, we investigate the role of mean-motion resonances and their associated heteroclinic connections in enabling natural semi-major axis transport in the Earth-Moon system. Working within the planar circular restricted three-body problem, we compute and analyze families of periodic orbits associated with the interior 4:1, 3:1, and 2:1 lunar resonances. These families exhibit a rich bifurcation structure, including transitions between prograde and retrograde branches and connections through collision orbits. We construct stable and unstable manifolds of the unstable resonant orbits using a perigee-based Poincaré map, and identify heteroclinic connections - both between resonant orbits and with lunar $L_1$ libration-point orbits - across a range of Jacobi constant values. Using a new generalized distance metric to quantify the closeness between trajectories, we establish operational times-of-flight for such heteroclinic-type orbit-to-orbit transfers. These connections reveal ballistic, zero-$\\Delta v$ pathways that achieve major orbit changes within reasonable times-of-flight, thus defining a network of accessible semi-major axes. Our results provide a new dynamical framework for long-term spacecraft evolution and cislunar mission design, particularly in regimes where lunar gravity strongly perturbs distant circumterrestrial orbits.",

      "abstract": "Turbulence and dust fragility in protoplanetary discs Simin Tong, Richard Alexander, Giovanni Rosotti 20 pages, 13+2 figures. Accepted for publication in MNRAS Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Dust growth from micron- to planet-size in protoplanetary discs involves multiple physical processes, including dust collisions, the streaming instability, and pebble accretion. Disc turbulence and dust fragility matter at almost every stage. Previous studies typically vary one of them while fixing the other, failing to provide a complete picture. Here, we use analytical models and numerical dust evolution models DustPy to study the combinations of gas turbulence and dust fragility that can reproduce multi-wavelength ALMA observables. We find that only appropriate combinations -- fragile dust (fragmentation velocity $v_\\mathrm{frag}$= 1-2 m/s) in discs with viscous $\\alpha=10^{-4}$ or resilient dust ($v_\\mathrm{frag}$= 6-10 m/s) in discs with viscous $\\alpha=10^{-3}$ -- can reproduce observations. Our result is robust to two widely used opacities (DSHARP and Ricci opacities). Regardless of the strength of disc turbulence, reproducing observations requires observed dust rings to be optically thick at $\\lambda=1.3$ and $3$ mm. As only small dust can be lifted above the midplane to reach the emitting layers, SED analysis probably yields lower limits on the maximum grain sizes. We highlight the challenge of creating detectable dust rings at large radii when incorporating bouncing in models, and the need for earlier formation of dust rings at smaller radii to reproduce the decreasing ring brightness with radius observed across ALMA wavelengths.",

      "abstract": "Finite Lifetime Fragment Model 4 for Striae Formation in the Dust Tails of Comets (FLM 4) Acceleration by Lorenz-force Kimihiko Nishioka Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The striations in the dust tails of comets are referred to as striae, and their origin has long been a mystery. We introduce a new dynamic model to describe the forms of the striae observed in comets Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1), West (C/1975 V1), and Seki-Lines (C/1962 C1). Charged particles made of refractory materials, with radii less than 0.5micrometer, are expelled from the comet's nucleus and accelerated by Lorentz forces near the nucleus. These particles decay many times to form striae, which have a lifespan of less than about 100 days at a distance of 1 astronomical unit from the sun. Over time, they continue to decay and eventually disappear from view. The following dynamic model explains these material science processes. Particles expelled from the comet's nucleus are subjected to three forces: solar gravity, solar radiation pressure, and Lorentz forces near the nucleus. As these particles decrease in size, the Lorentz forces and radiation pressure cause fluctuations, increasing and decreasing to form striae. This model, which is less of a dynamic approximation than previous theories (FLM3), explains the structure of the striae, enables predictions of their luminosity, and clarifies their origin.",

      "abstract": "The Dependence of Earth Milankovitch Cycles on Martian Mass Stephen R. Kane, Pam Vervoort, Jonathan Horner 16 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The Milankovitch cycles of Earth result from gravitational interactions with other bodies in the Solar System. These interactions lead to slow changes in the orbit and angular momentum vector of Earth, and correspondingly influence Earth's climate evolution. Several studies have shown that Mars may play a significant role in these Milankovitch cycles, such as the 2.4 Myr eccentricity cycle related to perihelion precession dynamics. Here we provide the results of a detailed dynamical analysis that explores the Earth Milankovitch cycles as a function of the Martian mass to quantify the extent that Mars influences variations in Earth's orbital eccentricity, the longitude of perihelion, the longitude of the ascending node, and obliquity (axial tilt). Our results show that, although the 405 kyr long-eccentricity metronome driven by $g_2$ (Venus) and $g_5$ (Jupiter) persists at all Mars masses, the $\\sim$100 kyr short-eccentricity bands driven by $g_4$ (Mars) lengthen and gain power as Mars becomes more massive, consistent with enhanced coupling among inner-planet $g$-modes. The 2.4 Myr grand cycle is absent when Mars approaches zero mass, reflecting the movement of $g_4$ with the Martian mass. Meanwhile, Earth's obliquity cycles driven by $s_3$ (Earth) and $s_4$ (Mars) lengthen from the canonical $\\sim$41 kyr with increasing Mars mass, relocating to a dominant 45--55 kyr band when the mass of Mars is an order of magnitude larger than its present value. These results establish how Mars' mass controls the architecture of Earth's climate-forcing spectrum and that the Milankovitch spectrum of an Earth-like planet is a sensitive, interpretable probe of its planetary neighborhood.",
