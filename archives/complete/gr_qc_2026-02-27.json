To appear in European Journal of Physics General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Black holes are some of the most interesting objects in the universe. While they first arise in the complicated behavior of general relativity, the physical laws ruling their behavior are surprisingly simple. For example, one of the core facts about black holes is that their area never decreases, much alike the entropy in thermodynamics. In this note directed at introductory physics students and their instructors, we use this similarity to understand properties of black hole physics using standard techniques from an undergraduate course in thermal physics. We explore the never-decreasing nature of black hole area to obtain bounds on the energy emitted in a black hole merger (a calculation originally done by Hawking). We show how this allows us to think of black holes in manners very similar to heat engines, and how these ideas have been used in modern gravitational wave observatories to test general relativity. This allows a research-level topic to be discussed in introductory physics lectures.",

      "abstract": "Quantum Cosmology, Decoherence, and the Emergence of Classical Spacetime Ali Nayeri General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We analyze the emergence of classical cosmological spacetimes in quantum cosmology by computing the reduced density matrix for long-wavelength curvature perturbations. Starting from standard Hartle--Hawking and tunneling boundary conditions, we emphasize that semiclassical WKB structure and inflationary squeezing do not by themselves yield classicality. Tracing over unobserved degrees of freedom and using the influence functional formalism, we derive the decoherence functional for superhorizon curvature modes during inflation. For a light massive environmental scalar field in the Bunch--Davies vacuum, we obtain an explicit noise kernel and show how a nonzero mass regulates the infrared behavior. We then evaluate decoherence under horizon-based and EFT-motivated coarse grainings, finding efficient suppression of interference between macroscopically distinct perturbation histories in both cases. The analysis clarifies the distinct roles of boundary conditions (branch amplitudes) and decoherence (classical branch selection) and yields an emergent cosmological arrow of time through environment-induced entanglement.",

The geometry is horizon-free, geodesically complete, and asymptotically flat, with negative Gaussian curvature localized near the throat. Using the fully covariant vector boson formalism and covariant Maxwell theory, we derive an exact Schrödinger-type radial equation with a curvature-induced effective potential. Recasting the dynamics in Helmholtz form yields an effective refractive-index profile, showing that the wormhole acts as an inhomogeneous optical medium with position-dependent refractive index and frequency-dependent confinement, where low-frequency modes are strongly trapped while high-frequency modes propagate almost freely. A differential-geometric correspondence with helicoidal surfaces is established via $1/[a^2(1-\\eta)] \\leftrightarrow w^2$, demonstrating that Lorentz-violation-induced curvature is mathematically equivalent to curvature generated by geometric twist and linking the model to twisted graphene nanoribbons as analog-gravity platforms. These results provide a geometric framework for curvature-driven localization, dispersion, and anisotropic wave propagation in topologically nontrivial $(2+1)$-dimensional backgrounds.",

FFT-based paraxial tools treat propagation in free space and therefore do not explicitly enforce beam tube boundary conditions. We introduce a waveguide-like mode description of the optical field that incorporates an imposed beam tube boundary condition and enables an independent benchmark of free-space FFT tools We derive the associated modal-mixing matrices for mirrors and baffles, including a closed-form series for axisymmetric circular apertures. We quantify the strain-equivalent couplings from baffle miscentering and from a localized near-wall tube defect, and show that they are suppressed as baffle density increases.

Fazlollahi General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this study, by revisiting the quantum interpretation of the cosmological constant, we introduce its formal representation within standard General Relativity. Examining its behavior in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime reveals a mechanism in which the symmetry between energy and momentum is dynamically broken. Applying this concept naturally leads to the derivation of the familiar LCDM model, while simultaneously alleviating both the fine-tuning and coincidence problems. Comparison of the ground-state energy behavior in the Friedmann equations with a dust matter field further indicates that large-scale matter exhibits the same symmetry-breaking behavior. Remarkably, due to this broken symmetry, the interactions between local regions of matter in the large-scale structure generate effective pressure, driving late-time acceleration and reproducing the LCDM expansion history without invoking exotic fields or negative-pressure components. This framework provides a self-consistent realization of LCDM within General Relativity, emerging entirely from the intrinsic dynamics of standard matter without fine-tuning and coincidence problems.",

Adopting the specific form $f(R,T) = R + 2\\chi T$, we consider an anisotropic Kiselev fluid as the matter content and obtain static cylindrical solutions, which are then extended to the rotating case through a suitable coordinate transformation. The influence of the quintessence state parameter $w_q$ and the matter--geometry coupling constant $\\chi$ on the geometry is analyzed. We examine the weak, null, and strong energy conditions, identifying the regions in the parameter space where they are satisfied. Furthermore, we apply the Hamilton--Jacobi method to study the tunneling of scalar particles across the event horizon and derive the corresponding Hawking temperature. The thermodynamic stability of the solutions is investigated by computing the heat capacity, and the conditions for phase transitions are discussed. The results provide a characterization of black strings in $f(R,T)$ gravity surrounded by quintessence, highlighting the combined effects of anisotropic matter and modified gravity on their physical properties.",

Rodulfo General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this paper, we investigate the dynamic phenomenological signatures of a Schwarzschild-MOG black hole shadow perturbed by passing gravitational waves. By perturbing the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for photon null geodesics, we demonstrate that the unique field content of MOG breaks the observational degeneracy with standard General Relativity. We mathematically prove two distinct, time-dependent signatures. First, the massless MOG scalar field induces a volumetric ``breathing mode'' polarization, causing the total apparent area of the shadow to rhythmically expand and contract. Second, the massive MOG vector field undergoes quantum vacuum dispersion, arriving at the observer with a predictable time delay. This delayed massive wave sources secondary longitudinal metric perturbations that manifest as a sudden, asymmetric translational wobble of the shadow on the celestial screen. These dynamic geometric shifts offer a robust observational template for next-generation interferometry to strictly test the existence of massive force carriers and scalar fields in gravity.",

Building on the standard relations for Hawking temperature and Bekenstein--Hawking entropy, we formalize energy layers via quasi-local radial energy accounting (e.g.\\ integrating an effective local energy density over spherical shells) and connect this bookkeeping to the free energy $\\FHelm=M-Þ\\SBH$. We then extend the entropy correction ansatz with explicit series inversion and derive higher-order expansions for $Þ(M)$ and $\\FHelm(M)$, including logarithmic and inverse-mass terms. To enhance mathematical transparency, we add intermediate derivations, lemma/theorem statements, and appendices. The quasi-superradiant mechanism is framed as a Carnot-like thought experiment powered by the Tolman temperature gradient between the near-horizon region and infinity; we show that the generalized second law enforces the Carnot bound and yields integrated maximum-work inequalities. Throughout, we stress that the proposal is heuristic and intended as a consistency-checked framework for discussion rather than a claim of definitive new physics.",

We systematically investigate the influence of various parameters on the energy extraction process, comparing the results in two distinct regions: the circular orbit region and the plunging region. {The results reveal that the Lorentz-violating parameter has a significant impact on energy extraction, affecting not only the parameter space where energy extraction is possible, but also the energy extraction power and efficiency.} It is found that the energy extraction process in the circular orbit region can offer a promising avenue for constraining KR gravity. In contrast, although energy extraction from the plunging region remains feasible even for black holes with relatively low spins and takes place nearer to the event horizon, its sensitivity to the Lorentz-violating parameter is significantly reduced. Overall, the Comisso-Asenjo magnetic reconnection mechanism can serve as a probe of the KR field, particularly through the energy extraction process in the circular orbit region.",

The present paper addresses the inverse problem, for which we consider quadrupole moments of pulsar timings due to GWs from a dominant isolated source such as a binary of supermassive black holes over an isotropic stochastic background. Correlations between the quadrupole moments are discussed, where the correlations between pulsar pairs over the full sky are taken into account. The correlations turn out to be in the form of a three-dimensional traceless matrix with rank 2 that can be closely related with a projection tensor for the GW. Thereby, we demonstrate that the rank-2 matrix allows to estimate the DOA of the GW. In expectation of the forthcoming Square Kilometer Array, angular resolutions as well as DOA estimation errors are also examined.",

Li, Soichiro Kuwahara, Hiroaki Ohta, Minori Shikauchi, Leo Tsukada, Takuya Tsutsui General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The authors wished to document the sensitivity improvement that has been contributed to the GW detection rate by detection algorithm research and development efforts, and set about re-analyzing S5 and S6 to determine the sensitive time-volumes of a modern pipeline and compare them to that of analysis algorithms of the day. To our surprise, this effort led to the discovery of GW070605, what at first appeared to be a previously unreported high significance binary neutron star merger at a time when only the Livingston detector (L1) was operating -- data that could not have been analyzed and a signal that could not have been discovered previously because the algorithms of the day required coincidence between two or more detectors. GW070605's end time occurs in LIGO's L1 detector at 2007-06-05 18:37:02 UTC, and is estimated to be a merger with component masses of 1.82$M_\\odot$ and 1.24$M_\\odot$. The GstLAL detection algorithm estimates that noise processes produce false positives at least as significant as GW070605 at a rate of $8.6\\times10^{-10}$ per year. Disappointingly, subsequent investigations revealed the presence of a previously undocumented hardware injection in the L1 detector's Y arm end test mass' excitation channel, whose time and properties match that of GW070605. The injection does not appear in the Gravitational Wave Open Science Center list of hardware injections. We determined that while there is no sensitivity improvement between GstLAL and previous algorithms at the null-result threshold, there is marked improvement at above null-result thresholds; specifically, an approximately 55-times detection rate increase from initial-era algorithms at a FAR threshold of 1 per 7000 years.",

We introduce a third possibility: Einstein-frame time can dynamically attain a local minimum. This time-reversal is caused by phantom Chaplygin gas, whose acoustic cone defines a `causal-frame' geometry that is geodesically-complete. While gravity experiences time-reversal, the Chaplygin gas always evolves forward in time, realizing a transient mismatch in thermodynamic arrows of time. Time-reversal affects the scale-factor, enforcing a non-singular bounce in causal frame that is robust against any additional matter.",

Following a brief review of the magnetic reconnection process in the plunging region of a Kerr black hole, we introduce the hotspot model and imaging method. Based on numerical simulations, we separately study the hotspot images in the plunging region without magnetic reconnection, with magnetic reconnection, and when the escape condition is not met. We also compare these with hotspot images in the circular orbit region. The results show that for hotspot images without magnetic reconnection, if the plasma follow plunging orbits, the flare intensity gradually decreases, whereas if they follow circular orbits, the flare intensity remains nearly constant. Additionally, we find that in the plunging region, the signal for energy extraction is weaker compared to that in the circular orbit region.",

Curvature scalars and stress-energy components are given in closed form, showing a regular throat, equatorial reflection symmetry, and violations of all standard energy conditions, as required for traversable wormholes. We analyse the causal structure and show that, despite the presence of an ergoregion for sufficiently large $|J|$, the coordinate time defines a global temporal function, so the spacetime is stably causal and free of closed timelike curves. The optical appearance is studied via photon trajectories. The resulting shadows are smaller than Kerr's and depend on the wormhole shape.

Recent studies show that some PBHs can survive to the present epoch by gaining angular momentum through Hawking radiating photons and becoming extremal before complete evaporation. While this provides a plausible model in a two-derivative theory of gravity, additional issues arise in EFT-corrected theories of gravity. In such theories, a rapidly spinning black hole can lead to extremely high tidal forces on a near-horizon observer, with possible observational consequences. In this work, by modeling Hawking radiation as a biased random walk within an EFT of gravity, we show that nearly the same fraction of PBHs survives as in GR. We argue that the resultant near horizon tidal effects should be detectable in future gravitational-wave observables.",

Coughlin, Vuk Mandic, Uroš Seljak, Nikolaos Stergioulas General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Many traditional algorithms applied in gravitational-wave astronomy rely on the assumption of Gaussian noise, a condition not always met. To meet this need, this study extends a robust statistical framework, advancing previous work on heavy-tailed likelihoods, that adapts the hyperbolic likelihood method for full frequency domain applications. The framework is designed to maintain high performance under ideal conditions while improving robustness against non-Gaussian noise and outliers in real-world data. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach through two key case studies. The first case study analyzes a massive black hole binary merger in simulated Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) data with Gaussian noise, showing that the extended hyperbolic likelihood method performs comparably to the more commonly used Whittle likelihood. The second case study examines a stellar-mass black hole binary merger using real ground-based gravitational-wave data containing non-Gaussian noise or overlapping signals, where our framework exhibits increased robustness and yields more accurate parameter estimations. Our results show that the hyperbolic likelihood better captures the true noise distribution, providing a flexible and physically motivated alternative for GW data analysis across current and future detectors.",

We derive the deformed metric up to the second order of the NC parameter, utilizing the Seiberg-Witten map for the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. We explore how non-commutativity modifies key thermodynamic properties, such as the Hawking temperature and heat capacity, and the existence of a remnant mass at the final stage of evaporation. Additionally, the study of Hawking radiation for bosonic and fermionic particles is discussed. Applying a perturbative method, scalar quasinormal modes are analyzed numerically. Furthermore, null geodesics and photon sphere stability are explored via curvature and topological methods. The shadow radius and deflection angle are computed to understand observational signatures. Lensing observables are compared to Event Horizon Telescope observations to provide probable constraints on the non-commutativity parameter.

The numerical analysis file used for the construction of the figures may be found at this https URL General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We study the existence and radial stability of static, spherically symmetric thin shells separating two Schwarzschild--de Sitter spacetimes with parameters $(m_\\pm,\\Lambda_\\pm)$. Using the Israel junction formalism and a linear barotropic equation of state $p = \\lambda(\\sigma - \\sigma_1)c^2$, we decouple the sound speed $c_s^2 = \\lambda c^2$ from the equilibrium equation-of-state parameter $w_0 \\equiv p_0 / (\\sigma_0 c^2)$ and derive the effective potential governing radial dynamics. For observationally motivated parameters, stable configurations with $\\sigma_0>0$ and $0<\\lambda\\leq1$ exist only when $m_+/m_- > 1$. Three distinct stability windows emerge, when $\\lambda=1$: $-3/7 \\lesssim w_0 \\lesssim 1/2$ for $\\Lambda_+ = \\Lambda_-$, $-2/3 \\lesssim w_0 \\lesssim 1/2$ for $\\Lambda_+ > \\Lambda_-$ and $0 \\lesssim w_0 \\lesssim 1$ for $\\Lambda_+ < \\Lambda_-$. Positive-pressure shells ($w_0>0$) reside near the photon sphere, whereas negative-pressure shells ($w_0<0$) extend outward, reaching either the cosmological horizon or the static radius. Stability relies on the variation of $w(\\sigma)$ with the surface energy density. Negative pressure (tension) stabilizes the system because the tension increases during expansion. Conversely, positive pressure stabilizes the system because the pressure increases during contraction. Finally, a static, stable, dark, fluid thin shell acts as a gravitational refractive layer that enlarges the black hole's shadow for a distant, static observer outside the shell. The effect depends on the shell radius $R_0$, the background parameters $(m_{\\pm}, \\Lambda_{\\pm})$, and the equation-of-state. Dark fluid shells can be considered as theoretical toy models that illustrate qualitative effects. Future high-resolution black hole shadow observations could, in principle, use such models to explore how different equations of state might influence observable signatures.",

A range of black hole studies have offered insights into the dynamical and phenomenological aspects of this effective theory of gravity. In this work, the thermodynamics of a charged 4D-EGB black hole with Gauss--Bonnet (GB) coupling $\\alpha$, characterized by mass $M$ and charge $Q$ in the non-extremal regime $M>\\sqrt{Q^2+\\alpha}$ is investigated by combining a non-perturbative, quantum-gravity-inspired exponential correction to the entropy (quantified by $\\eta$) with information-geometric diagnostics. Within a canonical ensemble (fixed $Q$) paradigm, thermodynamic stability regions and phase-transition-like features are identified as the black hole size tends toward extremality due to Hawking evaporation. The Ruppeiner metric is then constructed on the $(M,Q)$ state space and the associated thermodynamic curvature is evaluated to characterize the effective interaction signatures and its relation to critical behavior. In addition, an effective quantum-work quantity, defined from the free-energy landscape using Jarzynski equality, is evaluated as an additional probe of short-distance, near-extremal behavior. The results indicate that departures from the general-relativistic behavior are negligible for large black holes but can become relevant at small horizon scales. Specifically, on short-distance scales, the combined influence of $\\alpha$ and $\\eta$ can modify stability of the extremal black hole geometry and remnants within this thermodynamic model.",

Starting from classical considerations, we derive an upper bound on the mass of extremal charged black holes in dS spacetime which constrains the admissible parameter space. To incorporate quantum gravity effects, we introduce higher-derivative corrections to the 3-form action and obtain additional bounds on these terms, ensuring consistency with swampland criteria. We further analyze these corrections from a thermodynamic perspective, confirming that the Wald entropy remains compatible with the classical extremality bound. Extending this setup to cosmological inflation, we examine the scalar dual of the 3-form in both large-field and small-field regimes. In the large-field limit, the potential acquires a Higgs-like structure that supports slow-roll inflation. In contrast, the small-field limit leads to an effective potential with an AdS minimum, rendering it inconsistent with the dS swampland constraints. Notably, we find that thermodynamic consistency can impose constraints more stringent than those derived from inflationary dynamics alone. These results underscore the utility of swampland-inspired principles in shaping viable models of early universe cosmology.",

Our findings reveal that an increase in the dilaton parameter leads to a shrinking of the bright ring, accompanied by enhancements in both its width and brightness. As the disk thickness grows, the bright ring's diameter and width both decrease. The brightness enhancement induced by the disk thickness is less prominent than that driven by the dilaton parameter. Comparing with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observational data of SgrA*, we present the allowed ranges of black hole parameters, and find that effects of the disk thickness on the allowed parameter space are stronger than those of the observer's inclination. Furthermore, we analyze the coefficient $\\beta_2$, associated with the two-fold rotational symmetry of the electric vector position angles (EVPA), to probe the polarization structure of the black hole images, and reveal that effects of the disk thickness on $\\beta_2$ are much weaker than those from the dilaton parameter.",

For a BH with a mass greater than about $10 M_{\\odot}$, the tidal disruption of NS should occur within the event horizon, and hence neither can the stellar material escape nor a distant observer observe the disruption. Since NaS does not have an event horizon, a significant portion of the NS's material can escape, and the tidal disruption can be observed by a distant observer. One could identify such an event from the observed emission from the disrupted NS's material and the decay of the light curve of the disruption event. The escape of a significant fraction of the NS's material may also have implications for the heavy elements in the universe. Moreover, observing such an event can be useful for confirming a NaS, probing its spacetime, and studying the motion of matter in such a geometry. This may help constrain the NS parameters and equation of state models. As a first step in this direction, we calculate here the tidal disruption radius and other parameters for a specific type (Joshi-Malafarina-Narayan type 1) of NaS and compare our results with observations.",

However, in self-force theory one can also define a complete set of constants of motion: energy, azimuthal angular momentum, and radial and polar actions. Here we outline how directly utilizing these constants allows for more straightforward comparisons and hybridizations across the parameter space, as well as more streamlined waveform generation through flux-balance laws. Restricting to the case of nonspinning binaries and first order in self-force, we compute the constants of motion and the corrections to fundamental frequencies numerically as well as analytically (to 9PN in a post-Newtonian expansion), establishing consistency with the highest-order (4PN) results available from post-Newtonian theory.

They have proven useful for constructing numerical gravitational waveforms and for characterizing gravitational memory. As the precision of current and future detectors continues to improve, such constraints become increasingly important for high-precision tests of gravity, including searches for deviations from general relativity. This motivates a systematic understanding of analogous balance laws in theories beyond general relativity. In this work, we investigate the existence and structure of flux laws at null infinity in diffeomorphism-invariant extensions of general relativity. Our analysis is based on the covariant phase space formalism and the definition of conserved quantities, as presented by Wald and Zoupas. For a particularly relevant class of Horndeski theories, we derive a general expression for the flux and formulate the corresponding balance equation via the associated non-conserved charges. We cross-check our general results by comparing them with previous studies of Brans-Dicke gravity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the employed methods extend straightforwardly to a broader class of diffeomorphism-invariant theories. The null part of the resulting flux laws associated with null memory is compared with and validated against the alternative derivation based on the Isaacson approach to gravitational radiation. Beyond the specific results obtained, this work is intended to serve as a practical guide for computing balance laws in generic diffeomorphism-invariant theories of gravity and paves the way for an in-depth comparison between the Isaacson approach and the covariant phase space formalism.",

Only minor corrections of typos in the previous version were made Classical Physics (physics.class-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph) The radiation-reaction problem of standard Lorentz electrodynamics with point charges is pathological, standing in contrast to Bopp--Landé--Thomas--Podolsky (BLTP) electrodynamics where it is in fact well-defined and calculable, as reported in a previous publication. To demonstrate the viability of BLTP electrodynamics, we consider the BLTP analogue of the radiation reaction of a classical point charge accelerated from rest by a static homogeneous capacitor plate field, and calculate it up to $O(\\varkappa^4)$ in a formal expansion about $\\varkappa=0$ in powers of $\\varkappa$, Bopp's reciprocal length, a new electrodynamics parameter introduced by BLTP theory. In a paper by Carley and Kiessling (arXiv:2303.01720 [this http URL-ph]) the radiation-reaction corrections to test-particle motion were explicitly computed to $O(\\varkappa^3)$, the first non-vanishing order. In this article a crucial question regarding this ``small-$\\varkappa$'' expansion, raised by Carley and Kiessling, is answered as follows: The motions computed with terms $O(\\varkappa^3)$ included are mathematically accurate approximations to {physically reasonable} solutions of the actual BLTP initial value problem for short times $t$, viz. when $\\varkappa c t \\ll 1$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuo, but their unphysical behavior over {much} longer times does not accurately approximate the actual BLTP solutions even when the dimensionless parameter $\\varkappa e^2 / |m_b| c^2 \\ll 1$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_b$ the bare rest mass of the electron. This has the important implication that BLTP electrodynamics remains a viable contender for an accurate classical electrodynamics with point charges that does not suffer from the infinite self-interaction problems of textbook Lorentz electrodynamics with point charges.",

Hujeirat, Paulsamy Muruganandam Phys. Rev. D 113, L041305 (2026) Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Neutron star glitches -- sudden increases in rotational frequency -- are thought to result from angular momentum transfer via quantized vortices in the superfluid core. To investigate the underlying superfluid dynamics, we employ a two-dimensional rotating atomic Bose-Einstein condensate described by a damped Gross-Pitaevskii equation with an imposed pinning potential that serves as a simplified analogue of a crust. Within this minimal framework, we examine the emergence and evolution of turbulent vortex motion following impulsive perturbations reminiscent of glitch-like forcing. Our simulations reveal a transient Kolmogorov-like turbulent cascade ($k^{-5/3}$) that transitions to a Vinen-like scaling ($k^{-1}$). We identify an anomalous secondary injection mechanism driven primarily by quantum pressure, which can sustain turbulent fluctuations in such a system. By tuning the damping coefficient $\\gamma$, we determine an optimal regime for energy transfer. While idealized, these findings illustrate how quantum turbulence with multiple scaling regimes can arise in pinned, rotating superfluids, and they suggest possible qualitative connections to vortex-mediated dynamics in neutron stars and other astrophysical superfluid systems.",

This is useful for the researchers seeking intuitive insight into relativistic gravity. Focusing on the perihelion precession of Mercury, gravitational redshift, and gravitational light bending, we derive analytical expressions for orbital precession and demonstrate that, with suitable physically acceptable parameters, pseudo-Newtonian approaches can accurately reproduce the observed perihelion advance and gravitational redshift. However, we confirm that no single potential consistently captures all relativistic effects. In particular, while certain parameters yield agreement with general relativity for planetary motion and redshift, they fail to reproduce gravitational lensing over a broad range of impact parameters. Our results highlight both the usefulness and limitations of pseudo-Newtonian methods in modeling gravitational phenomena. Although the pseudo-Newtonian approach cannot serve as universal substitutes for general relativity, especially in strong-field regimes, it provides valuable semi-analytical insight and pedagogical simplicity. Our results indicate the usefulness of the pseudo-Newtonian approach to uncover more complicated phenomena involved with strong field gravity in possibly modification to general relativity.",

The motivation is to enable realistic accretion disk studies in MGR, where full relativistic MHD simulations remain computationally prohibitive. Effective potentials and the underlying Newtonian-like forces are derived for both massive and massless particles in the equatorial plane, relevant for disk dynamics. The reliability of the PNP is tested by comparing key orbital properties -- marginally stable, marginally bound, photon orbits and energies at marginally stable orbit radii -- with exact MGR predictions. The PNP reproduces the marginally stable and photon orbits exactly, while marginally bound orbits and specific energies deviate by less than about 7-10%. The influence of the MGR parameter on particle dynamics and effective potentials is analyzed, revealing non-trivial departures from simple Newtonian intuition. The study demonstrates that the proposed PNP accurately captures essential spatial properties of MGR spacetime and provides an efficient, physically consistent tool for investigating accretion phenomena and strong-gravity astrophysics beyond general relativity.",
