      "abstract": "Fractional Dynamics in Galactic Nuclei: Non-Local Transport, Transient Phenomena and the Nullification of the Schwarzschild Barrier Pau Amaro Seoane Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We demonstrate the necessity of fractional calculus for modeling anomalous diffusion in stellar dynamics, specifically Resonant Relaxation (RR) near a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Standard transport theories rely on the local Fokker-Planck (FP) equation, a formalism restricted to Gaussian processes governed by the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). This approach fails for RR, which is a superdiffusive Lévy flight characterized by non-local transport and governed by the Generalized Central Limit Theorem (GCLT). We apply the space-fractional Fokker-Planck equation (FFPE), utilizing non-local Riemann-Liouville operators, to resolve major discrepancies between local theory and observations. In transient regimes, the FFPE predicts an immediate, linear flux ($\\Gamma(t) \\propto t$), consistent with high Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) rates in post-starburst galaxies, whereas local FP models predict an unphysical exponential delay ($\\Gamma(t) \\propto \\exp(-C/t)$). Furthermore, we prove mathematically that the non-local integral operators permit ``barrier jumping''. This mechanism nullifies transport bottlenecks like the proposed Schwarzschild Barrier (SB). Local models incorrectly interpret the SB as severely suppressing Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspiral (EMRI) rates. We validate our theoretical findings using direct-summation $N$-body simulations incorporating relativistic corrections. The simulations confirm that particle flux remains continuous across the SB in the regime where RR dominates, demonstrating that the barrier does not inhibit EMRI production. The fractional framework provides the correct physical description for non-local transport, resolving long-standing problems concerning TDE and EMRI rates.",

In this approach, the modified Friedmann equation is incorporated into the neural network loss function, enabling training on Cosmic Chronometers data up to \\(z \\leq 2\\). The framework allows for the simultaneous estimation of the Hubble constant \\(H_0\\), the neutrino density parameter \\(\\Omega_\\nu\\), and the Tsallis non-extensivity index \\(\\delta\\). Uncertainty quantification is performed through dropout simulations, resulting in statistically consistent \\(1\\sigma\\) confidence bands. Our results show that the THDE+$\\nu$ model, reconstructed via PINN, alleviates the statistical Hubble tension from the canonical \\(\\sim 5\\sigma\\) level down to a range of \\(0.5\\sigma \\leq T \\leq 2.2\\sigma\\), depending on the redshift sampling. Additionally, we constrain the total neutrino mass to \\(\\Sigma m_\\nu < 0.11\\,\\text{eV}\\). A detailed comparison with the traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis demonstrates the consistency of both methods, while highlighting the competitiveness of the PINN-based THDE framework as a robust, data-driven approach for non-parametric cosmological inference within generalized thermodynamics.",

Comments are welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Warm inflation is a well-motivated and generalized framework of inflation, describing a coupled inflaton-radiation bath. In this work, we investigate a warm inflation model with a quartic potential and a composite dissipation coefficient $\\Upsilon(\\phi, T) = C_1 \\frac{T^3}{M_{\\text{Pl}}^2} + C_2 \\frac{T^3}{\\phi^2}.$ The two terms in $\\Upsilon$ dominate at different scales: the first term governs the early inflationary dynamics at large (CMB) scales, while the second term becomes significant at smaller scales. The model features two distinct stages of inflation: an initial phase where strong dissipation ($Q \\gg 1$) generates a red-tilted primordial spectrum consistent with CMB observations (from ACT), followed by a second phase producing a blue-tilted spectrum with a significant amplification of power at small scales, leading to primordial black hole formation. We analyze the effects of key parameters -- like the duration of each inflationary phase, the slow-roll parameter at the end of the first phase, the dissipation strength at the pivot scale, and the choice of the growth function -- on the primordial power spectrum and its spectral index. Additionally, we examine the consistency of the model with the swampland distance conjecture and trans-Planckian conjecture, needed for embedding these models with some UV complete theories. This work highlights the potential of warm inflation with a composite dissipation coefficient to reconcile large-scale CMB measurements with small-scale structure formation.",

However, direct and precise measurements of the disk density profiles remain elusive for current telescopes. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to pinpoint the gas density if an inspiralling stellar mass binary black hole is embedded in the AGN disk. Furthermore, if the barycenter of the pair follows an eccentric orbit around an AGN, then space-borne gravitational wave detectors can measure the density of the surrounding disk with multi-year observations by tracking the gravitational wave evolution. The error between the inferred density profile and the injected truth can be constrained to below $2\\times10^{-11}\\rm g/cm^3$.

Here we propose instead the possibility of holographic dark matter. In this case, dark matter does not arise in the framework of particle physics but is derived from the infrared cutoff set by the horizon scale. Using the Ricci cutoff, and a universe containing only baryons and radiation, we can account for the dark matter and naturally explain the coincidence between baryonic and nonbaryonic contributions to the density. In the presence of a pre-existing vacuum energy density our model reverses the sign of this density, thus accounting for the fact that certain string theories generically predict a negative vacuum energy, but observations require a positive value.",

These templates are derived without assuming a particular inflaton potential, thereby isolating the universal imprints of curvature on tensor modes. Our results predict characteristic large-scale features -- including low-$\\ell$ cut-offs and oscillatory patterns -- that are consistent with numerical solutions and provide a clear physical interpretation of how curvature modifies the underlying dynamics. In particular, we show that curvature effects manifest mathematically as systematic shifts in the dynamically relevant wavevectors, mirroring the behaviour previously identified in the scalar power spectrum. These features translate into distinctive signatures in the large-angle $B$-mode polarisation spectrum, offering a potential discriminant for spatial curvature in forthcoming CMB observations.",

Since the temperature is not typically a variable that is evolved independently, it must be extracted from the the evolved variables (e.g. the rest-mass density and specific internal energy). This extraction requires solving a quartic equation, which, in many applications, is done numerically using an iterative root-finding method. Here we show instead how the equation can be solved analytically and provide explicit expressions for the solution. We also derive Taylor expansions in limiting regimes and discuss the respective advantages and disadvantages of the iterative versus analytic approaches to solving the quartic.",

It plays a crucial role in understanding large-scale structure formation and cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. In this study, we apply perturbation theory to the minimally extended varying speed of light (meVSL) model to investigate the effects of a varying speed of light on the matter density contrast and the Newtonian gravitational potential. Unlike conventional models with a constant speed of light, the meVSL model introduces modifications to the cosmological evolution equations, leading to potential deviations in structure formation and gravitational interactions. By deriving and analyzing the perturbed equations within this framework, we explore how a varying speed of light affects the growth of density perturbations and the evolution of gravitational potentials. Compared to the standard constant speed of the light model, we find deviations of approximately $2$\\% in the subhorizon modes of both quantities. Although detecting these effects observationally remains a significant challenge, our results provide new theoretical insights into the meVSL model and its potential observational signatures, such as the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and gravitational lensing of the CMB.",

Published in Physical Review D High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The Einstein Telescope (ET), along with other third-generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors, will be a key instrument for detecting GWs in the coming decades. However, analyzing the data and estimating source parameters will be challenging, especially given the large number of expected detections-on the order of $10^5$ per year-which makes current methods based on stochastic sampling impractical. In this work, we use Dingo-IS to perform neural posterior estimation (NPE) of high-redshift events detectable with ET in its triangular configuration. NPE is a likelihood-free inference technique that leverages normalizing flows to approximate posterior distributions. After training, inference is fast, requiring only a few minutes per source, and accurate, as corrected through importance sampling and validated against standard Bayesian inference methods. To confirm previous findings on the ability to estimate parameters for high-redshift sources with ET, we compare NPE results with predictions from the Fisher information matrix (FIM) approximation. We find that NPE correctly recovers the eight degenerate sky modes induced by the triangular detector geometry, missed by the FIM analysis, resulting in an underestimation of sky localization uncertainties for most sources. FIM also overestimates the uncertainty in luminosity distance by a factor of $\\sim 3$ on average when the injected luminosity distance is $d^{\\mathrm{inj}}_{\\mathrm{L}} > 10^5~$Mpc, further confirming that ET will be particularly well suited for studying the early Universe.",

Shapiro 7 pages; matches version published in PRL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Observations of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers, including the recent signals GW231123 and GW230529, have revealed multiple progenitor black holes in the so-called upper and lower mass gaps, respectively. It is generally assumed that massive stars cannot form black holes in the upper mass gap because pair instabilities in the late stage of stellar evolution disrupt the stars, whereas the lower mass gap refers to the gap between the maximum allowed neutron star mass and the smallest black hole mass expected to form in supernova explosions. Here we explore a \"premature collapse\" scenario in which upper mass gap stars collapse and form black holes before they reach the late stage of stellar evolution. The mechanism for triggering a premature collapse is the capture of a smaller black hole, possibly primordial in nature. A similar capture scenario can occur to produce black holes in the lower mass gap. At least for massive stars, typical stellar rotation rates would likely result in rapidly rotating black holes in such a scenario, naturally explaining the rapid spins inferred from GW231123. Even though our estimates hinge on several parameters with rather large uncertainties, they suggest that, at least in galactic disks, the likelihood of such a capture is small for stars in the upper mass gap, but may lead to a significant population of black holes in the lower mass gap and, in fact, even below the lower mass gap.",

Barker 9 pages, 1 figure (+1 figure in appendix) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Gravitational-wave detectors can probe the existence of dark matter with exquisite sensitivity. Here, we perform a search for three kinds of dark matter -- dilatons (spin-0), dark photons (spin-1) and tensor bosons (spin-2) -- using three independent methods on the first part of the most recent data from the fourth observing run of LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA. Each form of dark matter could have interacted with different standard-model particles in the instruments, causing unique differential strains on the interferometers. While we do not find any evidence for a signal, we place the most stringent upper limits to-date on each of these models. For scalars with masses between $[4\\times 10^{-14},1.5\\times 10^{-13}]$ eV that couple to photons or electrons, our constraints improve upon those from the third observing run by one order of magnitude, with the tightest limit of $\\sim 10^{-20}\\,\\text{GeV}^{-1}$ at a mass of $\\sim2\\times 10^{-13}\\text{ eV}$. For vectors with masses between $[7\\times 10^{-13},8.47\\times 10^{-12}]$ eV that couple to baryons, our constraints supersede those from MICROSCOPE and Eöt-Wash by one to two orders of magnitude, reaching a minimum of $\\sim 5\\times 10^{-24}$ at a mass of $\\sim 10^{-12}$ eV. For tensors with masses of $[4\\times 10^{-14},8.47\\times 10^{-12}]$ eV (the full mass range analyzed) that couple via a Yukawa interaction, our constraints surpass those from fifth-force experiments by four to five orders of magnitude, achieving a limit as low as $\\sim 8\\times 10^{-9}$ at $\\sim2\\times 10^{-13}$ eV. Our results show that gravitational-wave interferometers have become frontiers for new physics and laboratories for direct multi-model dark-matter detection.",

Submitted to MNRAS Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Galaxy groups and clusters are excellent probes of large-scale structure and are shaped by some of the most energetic physical processes in the Universe. They follow a tight scaling relation of X-ray luminosity with halo mass. However, predicting the dependence of the scatter in this relation on mass and redshift is challenging, due to the statistical requirement of large simulation volumes. Using the large volume cosmological hydrodynamical simulations for galaxy cluster physics FLAMINGO and TNG300+TNG-Cluster, we fit this relation and its scatter, focusing on $M_{\\rm 500c}>10^{13}~\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ and $z \\leq 2$. We find qualitatively similar, but quantitatively different results for the two models. For the first time, we study ways to reduce the scatter using properties beyond X-ray luminosity, namely six ICM, six galaxy, and eleven dark matter halo properties. For both FLAMINGO and TNG300+TNG-Cluster, the gas fraction and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signal correlate strongest with X-ray scatter, reducing it by over 50% when accounting for their partial correlations. Galaxy and halo properties correlate weakly with X-ray scatter, typically reducing it by 10-20%. Our results are qualitatively robust across different FLAMINGO feedback variations, though the correlations weaken for stronger feedback and with increasing redshift. Differences between FLAMINGO and TNG300+TNG-Cluster are only apparent at the high-mass end - where e.g. the galaxy stellar age correlates strongly for FLAMINGO, but not for TNG300+TNG-Cluster - confirming robustness across physics implementations. We provide fitting formulas for the scatter and its corrections, for direct application to cosmological analyses and observational data.",

By using data from two separate suites of cosmological simulations, we show that our algorithm is able to determine whether ``observed'' data is consistent with its training domain, returning confidence estimates as well as accurate parameter estimations. We apply our algorithm to two-dimensional images of galaxy clusters from the BAHAMAS-SIDM and DARKSKIES simulations with the aim to measure the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter. Through deep compact clustering we construct an informative latent space where galaxy clusters are mapped to the latent space forming ``latent-clusters'' for each simulation, with the location of the latent-cluster corresponding to the macroscopic parameters, such as the cross-section, $\\sigma_{\\rm DM}/m$. We then pass through mock observations, where the location of the observed latent-cluster informs us of which properties are shared with the training data. If the observed latent-cluster shares no similarities with latent-clusters from the known simulations, we can conclude that our simulations do not represent the observations and discard any parameter estimations, thus providing us with a method to measure machine learning confidence. This method serves as a blueprint for transparent and robust inference that is in demand in scientific machine learning.",

In order to study the scale-dependent clustering of massive neutrinos, we develop a fast linear response method, FAST-nu f, applicable to neutrinos and other non-relativistic hot dark matter. Using it as an accurate linear approximation to help us reduce the dynamic range of emulator training data, based upon a non-linear perturbation theory for massive neutrinos, we improve the emulator's accuracy at small M_nu and length scales by a factor of two. We significantly sharpen its momentum resolution for the slowest neutrinos, which, despite their small mass fraction, dominate small-scale clustering. Furthermore, we extend the emulator from the degenerate to the normal and inverted mass orderings. Applying this new emulator, Cosmic-Enu-II, to large halos in N-body simulations, we show that non-linear perturbation theory can reproduce the neutrino density profile in the halo outskirts, 2R_vir < r < 10R_vir , to better than 10%.",

The model provides an excellent fit to the data, with a reduced chi-squared of $\\chi^2_{\\text{red}} = 0.987$, while successfully alleviating the Hubble constant tension. Our analysis yields a Hubble constant of $H_0 = 70.0$ km/s/Mpc, reducing the discrepancy between early and late-universe measurements. The data favor a negative power-law index of $n \\approx -0.92$. A model comparison using the Bayesian Information Criterion finds that the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model is still slightly preferred ($\\Delta\\text{BIC} = 2.178$) due to its fewer parameters.

However, the intrinsic faintness of the signal, as opposed to astrophysical foregrounds, poses a formidable challenge for its detection. Motivated by the recent success of machine learning based Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) methods in LOFAR and NenuFAR observations, we perform a Bayesian comparison among five GPR models to account for the simulated 4-hour tracking observations with the SKA-Low telescope. The simulated sky is convolved with the instrumental beam response and includes realistic radio sources and thermal noise from 122 to 134 MHz. A Bayesian model evaluation framework is applied to five GPR models to discern the most effective modelling strategy and determine the optimal model parameters. The GPR model with wedge parametrization ($\\textit{Wedge}$) and its extension ($\\alpha\\textit{Noise}$) with noise scaling achieve the highest Bayesian evidence of the observed data and the least biased 21-cm power spectrum recovery.

This dataset is challenging to analyze because the Sun heats and deforms the telescope mirror, complicating the characterization of the telescope. We perform more than one hundred null and consistency checks to ensure the robustness of our measurement and its compatibility with nighttime observations. We detect the CMB lensing power spectrum at 17$\\sigma$ significance, with an amplitude $A_\\textrm{lens} = 1.045 \\pm 0.063$ with respect to the prediction from the best-fit Planck-ACT CMB power spectrum $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In combination with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data, this corresponds to a constraint on the amplitude of matter fluctuations $\\sigma_8 = 0.826 \\pm 0.027$. The analysis presented here is especially relevant for ground-based millimeter-wave CMB experiments, paving the way for future analyses making use of both nighttime and daytime data to place tight constraints on cosmological parameters.",

We present a direct Bayesian model comparison using nested sampling to compute the Bayesian evidence, revealing a contrasting conclusion: for the key combination of the DESI DR2 BAO and the Planck CMB data, we find the Bayesian evidence modestly favours $\\Lambda$CDM (log-Bayes factor $\\ln B = -0.57{\\scriptstyle\\pm0.26}$), in contrast to the collaboration's 3.1$\\sigma$ frequentist significance in favoring $w_0w_a$CDM.

By performing a comprehensive tension analysis, employing five complementary metrics, we pinpoint the origin: a significant ($\\approx 2.95\\sigma$), low-dimensional tension between DESI DR2 and DES-Y5 that is present only within the $\\Lambda$CDM framework. The $w_0w_a$CDM model is preferred precisely because its additional parameters act to resolve this specific dataset conflict. The convergence of our findings with independent geometric analyses suggests that the preference for dynamic dark energy is primarily driven by the resolution of inter-dataset tensions, warranting a cautious interpretation of its statistical significance.",

      "abstract": "Baryonic Feedback across Halo Mass: Impact on the Matter Power Spectrum Kyle Miller, Surhud More, Bhuvnesh Jain Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Upcoming weak-lensing surveys will probe the matter distribution at a few percent level on nonlinear scales (k > 1 h/Mpc) where baryonic feedback from galaxy formation modifies the clustering of matter. Using the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations, we quantify the mass and radial dependence of baryonic suppression of the matter power spectrum by selectively replacing halos in the collisionless run with their full-physics counterparts. We find that group-scale halos with log $M_{200m}/h^{-1} M_{sun}$ in [13, 14] dominate the suppression, contributing a large fraction of the total reduction in power at k ~ 5-30 h/Mpc. The suppression is smaller on either side of this mass bin. Correctly reproducing the full suppression of the power spectrum requires accounting for matter redistribution (while enforcing mass conservation) beyond the virial radius of each halo. Crucially, the same group-scale regime produces the strongest and most detectable deviations in group-galaxy lensing, making stacked group lensing a powerful observational test of feedback models. Our results motivate emulators that jointly predict the matter power spectrum and halo-matter correlations including baryonic effects, enabling unbiased cosmological inference from small scales.",

Haehnelt, John Brennan, Pelle van de Bor, Paul C. Clark Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Here we introduce the SEEDZ simulations, a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations exploring the formation and growth of the first massive black holes in the Universe. SEEDZ includes models for Population III star formation, supernovae explosions and the resulting formation of light seed black holes, metal enrichment and subsequent Population II star formation, heavy seed black hole formation, Eddington and super-Eddington accretion schemes as well as black hole feedback. In this paper, we cover the overall methodologies employed and present our current results at $z=15$. Our main result so far is that black holes initially grow faster than their host galaxy, and hence over-massive black holes are a feature of the high-redshift Universe. The fundamental black hole-galaxy relationships we observe at $z = 0$ (especially the M$_{\\rm BH}$ - M$_*$ relationship) likely only emerge in more mature galaxies. At high-redshift, that relationship has not yet been established. We find that even at these high redshifts, MBHs can grow from their initial heavy seed mass of $\\sim$10$^4$ M$_\\odot$ up to 10$^6$ M$_\\odot$. At the high end of our MBH masses, our simulated galaxy M$_{\\rm BH}$ - M$_*$ relations match the observed high redshift trends i.e. over-massive BHs with M$_{\\rm BH}$/M$_{\\rm star} \\sim 10^{-2}$. This initial set of simulations will continue to run down to $z=10$, where we will perform a comprehensive comparison of simulated MBH number densities and M$_{\\rm BH}$ - M$_*$ relations with JWST observations. Further simulations with higher resolution will then follow.",

The Synference package is available at this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We introduce Synference, a new, flexible Python framework for galaxy SED fitting using simulation-based inference (SBI). Synference leverages the Synthesizer package for flexible forward-modelling of galaxy SEDs and integrates the LtU-ILI package to ensure best practices in model training and validation. In this work we demonstrate Synference by training a neural posterior estimator on $10^6$ simulated galaxies, based on a flexible 8-parameter physical model, to infer galaxy properties from 14-band HST and JWST photometry. We validate this model, demonstrating excellent parameter recovery (e.g. R$^2>$0.99 for M$_\\star$) and accurate posterior calibration against nested sampling results. We apply our trained model to 3,088 spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies in the JADES GOODS-South field. The amortized inference is exceptionally fast, having nearly fixed cost per posterior evaluation and processing the entire sample in $\\sim$3 minutes on a single CPU (18 galaxies/CPU/sec), a $\\sim$1700$\\times$ speedup over traditional nested sampling or MCMC techniques. We demonstrate Synference's ability to simultaneously infer photometric redshifts and physical parameters, and highlight its utility for rapid Bayesian model comparison by demonstrating systematic stellar mass differences between two commonly used stellar population synthesis models. Synference is a powerful, scalable tool poised to maximise the scientific return of next-generation galaxy surveys.",

Weaverdyck Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present improved cosmological constraints from a re-analysis of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) 5-year sample of Type Ia supernovae (DES-SN5YR). This re-analysis includes an improved photometric cross-calibration, recent white dwarf observations to cross-calibrate between DES and low redshift surveys, retraining the SALT3 light curve model and fixing a numerical approximation in the host galaxy colour law. Our fully recalibrated sample, which we call DES-Dovekie, comprises $\\sim$1600 likely Type Ia SNe from DES and $\\sim$200 low-redshift SNe from other surveys. With DES-Dovekie, we obtain $\\Omega_{\\rm m} = 0.330 \\pm 0.015$ in Flat $\\Lambda$CDM which changes $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ by $-0.022$ compared to DES-SN5YR. Combining DES-Dovekie with CMB data from Planck, ACT and SPT and the DESI DR2 measurements in a Flat $w_0 w_a$CDM cosmology, we find $w_0 = -0.803 \\pm 0.054$, $w_a = -0.72 \\pm 0.21$. Our results hold a significance of $3.2\\sigma$, reduced from $4.2\\sigma$ for DES-SN5YR, to reject the null hypothesis that the data are compatible with the cosmological constant. This significance is equivalent to a Bayesian model preference odds of approximately 5:1 in favour of the Flat $w_0 w_a$CDM model. Using generally accepted thresholds for model preference, our updated data exhibits only a weak preference for evolving dark energy.",

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGN) feature order-of-magnitude variability in both the continuum and broad line luminosities on months-to-years long timescales, and are currently unexplained. Simulations have demonstrated that rotating black holes sometimes tear apart tilted accretion disks. These tearing events violently restructure the disk on timescales much shorter than a viscous timescale, hinting at a connection to CLAGN. Here, we show that disk tearing can power changing-look events. We report synthetic observations of an extremely high resolution three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a geometrically thin, tilted accretion disk around a rapidly rotating, $10^8\\,M_\\odot$ black hole. We perform ray-tracing calculations that follow the disk light to both a line of sight camera and to a distribution of cameras in a prescribed torus-like broad line region. The continuum photoionizes the broad line region and we calculate the resulting spectrum. Both the continuum and line luminosities undergo order of magnitude swings on months-to-years long timescales. We find shorter, weeks long variability driven by the geometric precession of the inner disk and an intraday quasi-periodic oscillation driven by radial breathing of the inner disk. When the torn disk precesses, it causes asymmetric illumination of the broad line region, driving time-evolving red-to-blue asymmetries of the broad emission lines that may be a smoking gun for disk tearing. We also make predictions for future photometric observations from ULTRASAT and Vera Rubin Observatory, both of which may play an important role in detecting future changing-look events.",

Driessen, David L. Kaplan, Emil Lenc, Joshua Pritchard, Zorawar Wadiasingh, Zhijun Xu High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are a recently identified phenomenon that challenge our current understanding of compact objects and coherent radio emission mechanisms. These objects emit radio pulses similar to those of pulsars, but at much longer periods -- on the order of minutes to hours. With duty cycles of only a few percent, individual pulses have been observed to last between 10 and 1000 seconds. This places LPTs in a timescale gap between the two main techniques used in transient radio searches: time-series analysis at millisecond to second timescales, and image-plane searches sensitive to variability on the scale of days. As a result, LPTs remained undetected until recently, and only a handful are currently known. To increase the sample of known LPTs, we conducted a dedicated search using 200 hours of archival data from the ASKAP Evolutionary Map of the Universe survey, covering 750 deg$^2$ of sky at the shortest possible imaging time step of 10-seconds. This represents the first large-scale search using ASKAP data at second-scale resolution. Although no LPTs were detected, we identified flares from six stars, at least one had never been detected in the radio regime before. We placed a lower limit on the transient surface density of $2.21\\times10^{-6}$ deg$^{-2}$ at a 10-second timescale, with a sensitivity of 16.9 mJy. Our findings evaluate the feasibility of detecting radio transients using 10-second imaging with ASKAP and provide insights into improving detection pipelines and observation strategies for LPTs.",

We find that all the GALPROP models are consistent with the neutrino data within uncertainties. They are also consistent with expectations of neutrino emissions derived from LHAASO data when accounting for possible gamma-ray point source contamination.

      "abstract": "A precessing magnetic jet as the engine of GRB 250702B Tao An High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) GRB 250702B shows ultra long, episodic prompt activity, with three hard gamma ray episodes over about 3.2 h with quasi regular spacing P ~ 2825 s, preceded by a soft X ray flare about one day earlier. We interpret these phenomena with a unified scenario in which a stellar mass black hole accretes from a massive, misaligned debris disk and launches a magnetically dominated, precessing, structured (spine sheath) jet. The engine clock arises from Lense Thirring precession of the outer annulus of a geometrically thick inner torus at radius r ~ 250 to 300 gravitational radii, while the hard spectra reflect magnetic reconnection dissipation in the spine. A slightly off axis viewing geometry resolves the apparent opening angle tension without invoking late energy injection. \"Missing\" pulses in the second and third cycles occur naturally when low amplitude nutation causes the beaming cone to miss the line of sight. The model yields concrete, falsifiable predictions, providing a self consistent explanation of GRB 250702B radiative and outflow anomalies.",

We investigate the feasibility of synchrotron radiation with varying latitude from a magnetized neutron star to explain the source's spectra. We also shed light on the particle acceleration mechanisms and maximum Lorentz factor of electrons within the neutron star magnetospheric plasma under super-Eddington accretion conditions. In our broadband spectral modeling, the detection of a blackbody-like component suggests the presence of a disk near the corotation radius or an outflow ejected from the disk.

Sunil Chandra, Pankaj Kushwaha, Pranjupriya Goswami, Michael Zacharias 16 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present an extensive analysis of the multi-wavelength data of the low-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac object CGRaBS J0211+1051, which has been gathered over more than ten years with many observatories. Two major gamma-ray flares have been observed during the Fermi era: one in January 2011 and other in June 2019. During these events, CGRaBS J0211+1051 was also bright in other energy bands. On the other hand, there are also examples of optical activity that do not exhibit any comparable gamma-ray variability. Here, we study the temporal and spectral characteristics of the object in an attempt to understand the emission mechanisms operating in this source. A peculiar feature in its spectrum is the X-ray domain, which is unusually soft considering its object class. Interestingly, the relatively soft UV and optical spectrum does not extrapolate well to the X-rays. To mimic the observed SEDs during quiescent and flaring periods, we use both a purely leptonic and a hadro-leptonic modeling approach to reproduce four broadband SEDs from various epochs. When taking into account the steep optical-UV spectrum, we find that the hadro-leptonic scenarios better explains the SEDs compared to the purely leptonic model. The hadro-leptonic interpretation of the two gamma-ray flares suggests that CGRaBS J0211+1051 could be both a potential neutrino emitter and TeV-bright (E>10 TeV). Thus, it may offer a unique test bed to check for hadro-leptonic contributions to the multi-messenger emission in blazar jets.",

The mission ended after 36 h due to a balloon leak that resulted in the payload being lost in the Pacific Ocean. Over the course of the mission, the onboard Cherenkov Telescope (CT) was pointed just below the Earth's limb to search for optical signals from upward-moving extensive air showers that were induced by decaying tau-leptons that were generated by the conversion of $>10$ PeV tau-neutrinos in Earth. Such very-high energy (VHE) neutrinos may be produced in several classes of astrophysical sources that are suspected of possibly accelerating particles to ultra-high energies. In this contribution, we discuss the EUSO-SPB2 Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) campaign to search for VHE neutrino signals coming from astrophysical sources that crossed the CT's field of view ($6.4^\\circ \\times 12.8^\\circ$). We also present a new software tool designed for scheduling observations, the Neutrino Target Scheduler, that we developed to support the ToO campaign. We also calculate upper limits on the neutrino fluences from sources observed during the ToO campaign. Our observations demonstrate the viability of conducting ToO follow-up observations from a near space environment with future balloon missions, such as the pathfinder mission POEMMA-Balloon with Radio.",

Submitted to A&A. Comments more than welcome! High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) X-ray binaries exhibit complex variability patterns studied in the power-spectrum. These include the broad-band noise (BBN) components and various types of narrow components called quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). There is currently no consensus about either what determines the presence/absence of the BBN or what generates the QPOs. Many believe the latter is due to frame-dragging effects caused by Lense-Thirring torques. We wish to investigate the potential impact of those frame-dragging effects on the accretion disk itself. In particular, we focus on its impact on the observed variability and the presence (and types) of QPOs associated. We make analytical estimates to assess the potential presence of a geometric warp in the inner accretion disk during state transitions. We show that the presence of a warp can modify the spectral-timing properties in a way that matches the observed transition between QPO types during outbursts. We also discuss the peculiar case of Cyg X-1, as well as how the hard-to-soft transition could be driven by the warp itself. The (expected) emergence of a warp provides a consistent explanation for the evolution of both the BBN and the QPO properties during state transitions. This offers a first path toward unifying the variability of black hole X-ray binary.",

Submitted to ApJL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present 15 years of Nançay and Green Bank radio telescope timing observations for PSR J1231$-$1411. This millisecond pulsar is a primary science target for the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer telescope (NICER, which discovered its X-ray pulsations), has accumulated near-continuous $\\gamma$-ray data since the Fermi-Large Area Telescope's launch, and has been studied extensively with the Green Bank and Nançay radio telescopes. We have undertaken a campaign with the Green Bank Telescope targeting specific orbital phases designed to improve our constraint on the pulsar's mass through the detection of a relativistic Shapiro delay. Both frequentist and Bayesian techniques -- the latter incorporating priors from white dwarf binary evolution models -- are applied to fifteen years of radio observations, yielding relatively weak constraints on the companion and pulsar masses of $0.23^{+0.09}_{-0.06}$ M$_{\\odot}$ and $1.87^{+1.11}_{-0.67}$ M$_{\\odot}$, respectively (68.3% CI from Bayesian fits); however, the orbital inclination is measured to better relative precision ($79.80^{+3.47}_{-4.70}$ degrees). Restricting the maximum allowed pulsar mass to 3 M$_{\\odot}$ while simultaneously sampling the noise and timing models improves the constraint and lowers the measured mass to $1.62^{+0.73}_{-0.58}$ M$_{\\odot}$. While our radio-derived inclination result has informed recent NICER X-ray studies of PSR J1231$-$1411, the lessons learned from this troublesome pulsar will also bolster future high-precision mass measurement campaigns and resulting constraints on the neutron star interior equation of state.",

Machine-readable versions of the maps and spectra are available on Zenodo: this https URL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Microquasars have emerged as promising candidates to explain the cosmic-ray flux at petaelectronvolt energies. LHAASO observations revealed V4641~Sgr as the most extreme example so far. Using $\\approx$100~h of H.E.S.S. data, we performed a spectro-morphological study of the gamma-ray emission around V4641~Sgr. We employed HI and dedicated CO observations of the region to infer the target material for cosmic-ray interactions. We detected multi-TeV emission around V4641~Sgr with a high significance. The emission region is elongated. We found a power-law spectrum with an index $\\approx$1.8, and together with results from other gamma-ray instruments, this reveals a spectral energy distribution that peaks at energies of $\\approx$100~TeV for the first time. We found indications (3$\\sigma$) of a two-component morphology, with indistinguishable spectral properties. The position of V4641~Sgr is inconsistent with the best-fit position of the single-component model and with the dip between the two components. We found no significant evidence of an energy-dependent morphology. No dense gas was found at any distance towards V4641~Sgr. The peak of the SED at $\\approx$100~TeV identifies V4641~Sgr as a candidate cosmic-ray accelerator beyond the so-called knee. The absence of dense target gas places stringent energetic constraints on hadronic interpretations, however. The H.E.S.S. measurement requires an unusually hard ($\\approx 1.5$) spectral index for the protons. A leptonic scenario faces fewer obstacles if the particle transport is fast enough to avoid losses and to reproduce the observed energy-independent morphology. The absence of bright \\xray emission across the gamma-ray emission region requires a magnetic field strength $\\lesssim3$~$\\mu$G, however. Our findings favour a leptonic origin of the gamma-ray emission. This conclusion does not exclude hadron acceleration in the V4641~Sgr system.",

Coimbra Araújo, Rita de Cássia dos Anjos High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The detection of high-energy astrophysical multimessengers establishes a connection between ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and powerful cosmic accelerators. Interactions of UHECRs with radiation fields and interstellar matter generate very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays and neutrinos, making them key components in the multimessenger framework. This study examines the cosmogenic gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes resulting from UHECR propagation in starburst galaxies with supernova remnants, with a particular focus on NGC 1068, a well-established high-energy neutrino source. Using extragalactic simulations, we calculate the upper limit on cosmic-ray luminosity, applying upper limits on gamma-ray fluxes derived from observations by H.E.S.S. and MAGIC observatories. Our analysis incorporates the effects of both extragalactic and galactic magnetic fields on particle propagation, constraining the maximum extragalactic magnetic field (EGMF) intensity to $10^{-14}~\\mathrm{G}$ to ensure that at least 90\\% of injected UHECRs successfully reach Earth. The results provide upper limits on gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes, estimates of UHECR luminosity for individual sources, and predictions for the detection capabilities of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory regarding gamma-ray emission from NGC 1068. Combining gamma-ray, neutrino, and UHECR observations reinforces the importance of multimessenger approaches in understanding the nature of high-energy astrophysical sources and their role in cosmic-ray acceleration.",

Because the signals recorded by different detector types differ in physical nature, the direct merging of data is unfeasible, which complicates multimodal analysis. Currently, to analyze data from the IACTs and TAIGA-HiSCORE, a set of auxiliary parameters specific to each detector type is calculated from the recorded signals. These parameters are chosen empirically, so there is no certainty that they retain all important information and are the best suited for the respective problems. We propose to use autoencoders (AE) for the analysis of TAIGA experimental data and replace the conventionally used auxiliary parameters with the parameters of the AE latent space. The advantage of the AE latent space parameters is that they preserve essential physics from experimental data without prior assumptions. This approach also holds potential for enabling seamless integration of heterogeneous IACT and HiSCORE data through a joint latent space. To reconstruct the parameters of the primary particle of the EAS from the latent space of the AE, a separate artificial neural network is used. In this paper, the proposed approach is used to reconstruct the energy of the EAS primary particles based on Monte Carlo simulation data for TAIGA-HiSCORE. The dependence of the energy determination accuracy on the dimensionality of the latent space is analyzed, and these results are also compared with the results obtained by the conventional technique. It is shown that when using the AE latent space, the energy of the primary particle is reconstructed with satisfactory accuracy.",

A&A, accepted Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Through 3D hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the impact of Type Ia supernova (SN) explosions on the star formation history and chemical properties of second-generation (SG) stars in young globular clusters with masses of 10^5-10^6 Msun. We assume that the SG is formed out of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) ejecta of first-generation stars plus pristine interstellar medium gas which is modelled as a uniform gas moving at a constant velocity towards the cluster. We tested two values for the infalling gas density of 10^(-24) and 10^(23) g/cm^3. Type Ia SNe start to explode together with the release of gas from the most massive AGB stars. Three simulated models are analyzed. In the low-mass and low-density scenario, we find that SNe Ia quench star formation which however restarts when the gas cools down again in between two explosions. SG stars are dominated by a He-rich population (Y>0.33), which is poorly diluted by pristine gas. In the high-mass models, star formation is mildly affected, while the He composition is significantly altered as exploding SNe prevent the accretion of pristine gas and therefore extremely helium-rich stars form. In the high-density model, such weak gas accretion leads to a maximum enhancement in helium mass fraction much larger than the observed one and not correlating with the initial cluster mass as found in models without Type Ia SNe. As for the iron content, small spreads have been found in all models, but the SG is less homogeneous than the FG, at variance with current observations.",

Demorest, Wen-Fai Fong, Anya Nugent, Fabian Walter The Astrophysical Journal, 993, 221, 2025 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients that serve as unique probes of ionized extragalactic matter. We report the discovery and localization of two FRBs piercing the Andromeda galaxy (M31) with the realfast transient-detection system at the Very Large Array. These unique sightlines enable constraints on M31's electron density distribution. We localized FRB 20230930A to a host galaxy at redshift $z=0.0925$ and FRB 20230506C to a host galaxy at redshift $z=0.3896$. After accounting for the dispersion contributions from the Milky Way, the host galaxies, and the intergalactic medium, we estimate M31's contribution to be $26-239$ $\\rm pc~cm^{-3}$ toward FRB 20230930A and $51-366$ $\\rm pc~cm^{-3}$ toward FRB 20230506C, within the 90% credible interval (CI). By modeling the M31 disk's contribution, we isolate the halo component and find that M31's halo contributes $7-169$ $\\rm pc~cm^{-3}$ along FRB 20230930A (90% CI). The inferred values of $\\rm DM_{M31,halo}$ from the FRBs are consistent with predictions from a modified Navarro-Frenk-White (mNFW) profile at the corresponding impact parameter. The cool and warm phase gas is unlikely to account for the $\\rm DM_{M31,halo}$ unless the ionization fraction is as high as 90%. While limited to two sightlines, these results offer tentative evidence for the existence of a hot halo surrounding M31. We also discuss the potential contribution of other foreground structures, particularly in explaining the DM excess observed in FRB 20230506C. This work demonstrates how FRBs can be used to probe the circumgalactic medium of intervening galaxies.",

      "abstract": "The Host Galaxies of Fast Radio Bursts Track a Combination of Stellar Mass and Star Formation, Similar to Type Ia Supernovae Asaf Horowicz, Ben Margalit High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We develop a new statistical framework for studying the host galaxies of astrophysical sources that accounts for both redshift evolution and the multi-variate nature of host-galaxy properties. These aspects are critical when dealing with sources that span a wide range of redshifts, and/or with unknown redshift-dependent selection effects. We apply our method to a sample of Fast Radio Burst (FRB) host-galaxies as a means of probing the uncertain progenitor(s) of these events. Using our method we are able to rule out that FRBs track star-formation rate (SFR), as would be expected if FRBs are associated exclusively with young neutron stars born via core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Furthermore, we rule out a recently proposed metallicity-dependent model whereby FRBs track SFR only above an oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) ~ 8. Motivated by the fact that at least one FRB has been localized to a globular cluster (GC), we also investigate the hypothesis that FRB sources track GC mass and explicitly rule out this scenario. Alternatively, we find that a `mixed' model whereby FRBs track a linear combination of both SFR and stellar-mass best explains the data. The preferred parameters of such a mixed model are similar to those inferred for Type Ia SNe, and implies a possible connection between the progenitors of these different transients.",

Drout, Rodrigo Fernández Accepted to ApJ with revisions including new Figure 10 + new title; 19 pages, 13 figures in body High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The observed spectra and light curves of the kilonova produced by the GW170817 binary neutron star merger provide complementary insights, but modeling both the spectral- and time-domain has proven challenging. Here, we model the optical/infrared light curves of the GW170817 kilonova, using the properties and physical conditions of the ejecta as inferred from detailed modeling of its spectra. Using our software tool SPARK, we first infer the r-process abundance pattern of the kilonova ejecta from spectra obtained at 1.4, 2.4, 3.4, and 4.4 days post-merger. From these abundances, we compute time-dependent radioactive heating rates and the wavelength-, time-, and velocity-dependent opacities of the ejecta. We use these inferred heating rates and opacities to inform a kilonova light curve model, to reproduce the observed early-time light curves and to infer a total ejecta mass of $M_{\\mathrm{ej}} = {0.11}~M_{\\odot}$, towards the higher end of that inferred from previous studies. The combination of a large ejecta mass from our light curve modeling and the presence of both red and blue ejecta from our spectral modeling suggests the existence of a highly magnetized hypermassive neutron star remnant that survives for $\\sim$$0.01 - 0.5$ s and launches a blue wind, followed by fast, red neutron-rich winds launched from a magnetized accretion disk. By modeling both spectra and light curves together, we demonstrate how combining information from both the spectral and time domains can more robustly determine the physical origins of the ejected material.",

However, the determination is complicated by MSPs' long-term dynamic evolution and the scarcity of radial velocity measurements. We compiled 64 field MSP systems that are well astrometrically determined, and calculated their transverse peculiar velocities $\\boldsymbol{v}_\\perp$ and Galactic heights $z$. Assuming that the Galactic-longitude components $v_\\mathrm{l}$ of $\\boldsymbol{v}_\\perp$ are statistically stable over time (the \"stable-$v_\\mathrm{l}$\" assumption), we approached the distribution of the $v_\\mathrm{l}$ components of $\\boldsymbol{v}_\\mathrm{sys}$ by the observed $v_\\mathrm{l}$ sample. We find that the observed $v_\\mathrm{l}$ can be well described by a linear combination of three normal distributions. Accordingly, the MSP $v_\\mathrm{sys}$ distribution can be approximated by a linear combination of three Maxwellian components under the assumption that $\\boldsymbol{v}_\\mathrm{sys}$ directions are uniformly distributed. Our dynamical population synthesis analysis based on the derived $v_\\mathrm{sys}$ distribution verified the \"stable-$v_\\mathrm{l}$\" assumption in the parameter space of this work, and estimated the initial and the current Galaxy-wide scale heights of field MSP systems to be about 0.32 kpc and 0.68 kpc, respectively. According to the MSP $v_\\mathrm{sys}$ distribution, $\\approx14$% of all the MSPs born in a globular cluster with the nominal 50 $\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ central escape velocity can be retained. Therefore, the $v_\\mathrm{sys}$ distribution of field MSP systems may account for the high number of MSPs discovered in globular clusters, which implies that MSPs in star clusters may follow the same formation channel(s) as field MSP systems.",

PSR J0312$-$0921 and PSR J1627$+$3219 are black widow pulsars with orbital periods of 2.34 and 3.98 hours. They were recently detected in the radio and $\\gamma$-rays. Aims. Our goals are to estimate the fundamental parameters of both binary systems and their components. Methods. We performed first phase-resolved multi-band photometry of both objects with the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias and fitted the obtained light curves with a model assuming direct heating of the companion by the pulsar. Archival X-ray data obtained with the Swift and XMM-Newton observatories were also analysed. Results. For the first time, we firmly identified both systems in the optical. Their optical light curves show a rather symmetric single peak per orbital period and a peak-to-peak amplitude of $\\gtrsim$2 mag. We also identified the X-ray counterpart to J1627$+$3219, while for J0312$-$0921 we set an upper limit on the X-ray flux. Conclusions. We estimated the masses of the pulsars, companion temperatures and masses, Roche lobe filling factors, orbital inclinations, and the distances to both systems. PSR J0312$-$0921 has a very light ($\\approx$0.02 M$_\\odot$) companion which possibly has one of the lowest ($\\approx$1600 K) `night-side' temperatures among the known black widow systems. We found that the distances to J0312$-$0921 and J1627$+$3219 are about 2.5 and 4.6 kpc, respectively. This likely explains their faintness in X-rays. The X-ray spectrum of PSR J1627$+$3219 can be described by the power-law model, and its parameters are compatible with those obtained for other black widows.",

Lett. 994, L1 (2025) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) We employ first-principles, fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations to investigate magnetic field-line curvature in magnetically dominated turbulent plasmas and its role in particle acceleration through curvature-drift motion along the motional electric field. By varying the fluctuation-to-mean magnetic-field ratio $\\delta B_0/B_0$, we examine curvature $\\kappa$ statistics and their connection to particle acceleration. The curvature probability densities display broad power-law wings, scaling linearly in $\\kappa$ below the peak and developing hard high-$\\kappa$ tails for $\\delta B_0/B_0 \\gtrsim 1$. As the mean field strengthens, the high-$\\kappa$ tails steepen, and large-curvature events are suppressed when $\\delta B_0/B_0 \\ll 1$. The probability density functions of magnetic field-line contraction, ${\\bf v}_E \\cdot {\\bf \\kappa}$, with ${\\bf v}_E$ the field-line velocity, develop power-law tails well described by a symmetric Pareto distribution, characteristic of stochastic energy exchanges, with the tails becoming harder as $\\delta B_0/B_0$ increases. Our guiding-center analysis shows that curvature-drift acceleration accounts for a substantial fraction of the energization via the motional electric field, and that it strengthens with increasing $\\delta B_0/B_0$. For well-magnetized particles, curvature-drift acceleration typically exceeds ${\\bf\\nabla}B$ drift, polarization drift, and betatron contributions. These results identify curvature-drift acceleration as a principal pathway through which magnetized turbulence transfers energy to nonthermal particles in astrophysical plasmas.",

These analyses are based on the NuSTAR observation performed on 2024 August 7 for a total exposure of around 90 ks. The persistent emission is well described by an absorbed thermal Comptonization model. An absorption edge is also detected at an energy of approximately 7.87 keV, which indicates the presence of absorbing material in the vicinity of this system. Six bursts have been observed during this observation, wherein we find the burst recurrence time to be approximately 4.52 hr. All the bursts exhibit the characteristics of a sharp rise and exponential decay. We perform the time-resolved spectroscopy of the burst spectra described by a model consisting of thermal emission from the neutron star surface and a varying persistent emission component to study the evolution of burst parameters. The enhancement of the persistent emission during burst exposure is characterized by the scaling parameter f a, which reflects the increasing strength of the burst-disc interaction with burst intensity, likely driven by Poynting-Robertson drag. The spectral analysis of bursts estimate the average apparent blackbody emitting radius of the neutron star to lie within 1.5-3.5 km. The ignition depths computed from the burst parameters indicate short Type-I thermonuclear bursts from a mixed hydrogen-helium fuel layer.",

This population consists of a well-known subset called Little Red Dots (LRDs) and the remaining non-LRDs. If all of these broad H$\\alpha$ emitters were attributed to type $1-1.9$ Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), it would imply a significantly higher number density of low-luminosity AGNs than extrapolated from that of more luminous AGNs. Here, we have examined the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV)-optical flux variability of three LRD and two non-LRD broad H$\\alpha$ emitters using multi-epoch, multi-band JWST/NIRCam imaging data. The rest-frame temporal sampling interval of the NIRCam data ($\\sim 400-500$~days$/(1+z)$) is comparable to typical variability timescales of AGNs with black hole (BH) masses of $M_{\\text{BH}} \\sim 10^{7}~M_{\\odot}$; thus, the flux variations should be detectable if AGNs were present. However, no measurable flux variation over the rest-frame wavelength range of $\\lambda_{\\text{rest}} \\sim 1,500-9,000$Å has been detected, placing stringent upper limits on the variability amplitudes. This result, combined with the X-ray faintness confirmed by the ultra-deep Chandra data, indicates that, under the AGN scenario, we need to postulate peculiar Compton-thick broad-line AGNs with either ($a$) an intrinsically non-variable AGN disk continuum, ($b$) a host galaxy-dominated continuum, or ($c$) scattering-dominated AGN emission. Alternatively, ($d$) they could be non-AGNs where the broad-line emission originates from unusually fast and dense/low-metallicity star-formation-driven outflows or inelastic Raman scattering of stellar UV continua by neutral hydrogen atoms.",

Lovell, Joop Schaye 15 pages, 12 figures, submitted to MNRAS, comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We use the highest-resolution FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulation to quantify cosmic variance and large-scale coherence in the evolution of massive galaxies at high redshift. FLAMINGO combines a $(1\\,\\mathrm{cGpc})^3$ volume with baryonic resolution sufficient to identify ${\\gtrsim}\\,10^3$ independent JWST-like survey volumes of $(100\\,\\mathrm{cMpc})^3$, providing unprecedented statistics to characterize the extremes of cosmic variance. At $z\\,{\\simeq}\\,6$, the total variance in the number of haloes with $M_{200}\\,{\\simeq}\\,10^{11.5}\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ (or $M_\\ast\\,{\\simeq}\\,10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$) is 2--3 times the Poisson expectation, while this ratio decreases with redshift. Similarly, at $z\\,{\\gtrsim}\\,4$, the variance in the most massive halo per JWST-like field is twice the Poisson prediction. We find a pronounced large-scale \\emph{conformity}: in volumes ranked by the stellar mass of their most massive galaxy ($M_{\\ast,\\mathrm{max}}$), the stellar-to-halo mass relation and star-formation efficiency are coherently elevated or suppressed throughout the full $(100\\,\\mathrm{cMpc})^3$ volume. When accounting for galaxies outside the volume, this signal persists only to radii $\\lesssim 50\\,\\mathrm{cMpc}$, demonstrating that the detectable conformity is enhanced by the survey footprint. Moreover, $M_{\\ast,\\mathrm{max}}$ is a better predictor of the volume-wide efficiency of massive galaxies than the total number counts, which mainly trace clustering. Finally, the stellar fraction of the most massive galaxies peaks at $f_\\ast\\,{=}\\,M_\\ast\\,/\\,(M_{200}f_{\\rm b,cosmic})\\,{\\simeq}\\,0.2$ at $z\\,{\\simeq}\\,5$, with a narrower dispersion in $f_\\ast$ at fixed redshift and stronger redshift evolution than commonly assumed. These results show that both cosmic variance and footprint-confined conformity must be modelled when interpreting early massive galaxy populations in JWST fields.",

(2020) that are potential hosts of radio-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs), eight of which are non-nuclear and possible ``wandering\" black holes (BHs). Our multi-wavelength analysis indicates a heterogeneous sample with five radio sources detected at both X-ray and optical wavelengths within positional uncertainties and non-detections for the remaining objects. Of the radio objects detected in the X-ray/optical, three have multi-wavelength evidence for hosting nuclear massive BHs and one object is consistent with an extreme compact starburst. Only one of the off-nuclear radio sources has a significant optical counterpart and we present Palomar spectroscopy that identifies this object as a background AGN. We cannot definitively determine if the seven remaining off-nuclear radio sources are wandering massive BHs in the target dwarf galaxies or background AGNs, although the three sources with the largest offsets have compact radio cores detected with the Very Large Baseline Array and are consistent with expectations for background AGNs (Sargent et al 2022).

Package url: this http URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Quantitative morphology provides a key probe of galaxy evolution across cosmic time and environments. However, these metrics can be biased by changes in imaging quality - resolution and depth - either across the survey area or the sample. To prepare for the upcoming Rubin LSST data, we investigate this bias for all metrics measured by statmorph and single-component Sérsic fitting with Galfit. We find that geometrical measurements (ellipticity, axis ratio, Petrosian radius, and effective radius) are fairly robust at most depths and resolutions. Light concentration measurements ($C$, Gini, $M_{20}$) systematically decrease with resolution, leading low-mass or high-redshift bulge-dominated sources to appear indistinguishable from disks. Sérsic index $n$, while unbiased, suffers from a 20-40% uncertainty due to degeneracies in the Sérsic fit. Disturbance measurements ($A$, $A_S$, $D$) depend on signal-to-noise and are thus affected by noise and surface-brightness dimming. We quantify this dependence for each parameter, offer empirical correction functions, and show that the evolution in $C$ observed in JWST galaxies can be explained purely by observational biases. We propose two new measurements - isophotal asymmetry $A_X$ and substructure $St$ - that aim to resolve some of these biases. Finally, we provide a Python package statmorph-lsst implementing these changes and a full dataset that enables tests of custom functions (see text for links).",

Star-forming galaxies are identified using the $g-z$ color, and $F_{\\mathrm{sf}}$ is measured as a function of redshift, cluster halo mass, and galaxy stellar mass. Field galaxies are used as a comparison sample to reduce selection effects. For BCGs, $F_{\\mathrm{sf}}$ increases with redshift, showing a slow rise below $z \\sim 0.4 - 0.5$ and a more rapid increase above this range. In contrast, $F_{\\mathrm{sf}}$ decreases with increasing cluster halo mass and BCG stellar mass. At the low stellar mass end, BCGs exhibit higher star-forming fractions than field galaxies, suggesting enhanced star formation likely fueled by cold gas accretion from the intracluster medium. Also, star-forming BCGs tend to show larger projected offsets from the optical cluster density peak than quenching BCGs, indicating ongoing assembly. The analysis of the specific star formation rate (sSFR) further indicates a transition in the dominant mechanism driving star formation in BCGs: cooling flows are likely responsible at low redshift, while gas-rich mergers play a greater role at higher redshift. The shift in dominance occurs around $z \\sim 0.5$, aligning with the steep rise in $F_{\\mathrm{sf}}$ of BCG.",

Sirks, Eckhart Spalding, Sujeeporn Tuntipong, Jesse van de Sande, Pavadol Yamsiri 15 pages, 8 figures, 1 table, submitted to PASA Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Bars are ubiquitous morphological features in the observed distribution of galaxies. There are similarly many methods for classifying these features and, without a strict theoretical definition or common standard practice, this is often left to circumstance. So, we were concerned whether astronomers even agree on the bar which they perceive in a given galaxy and whether this could impact perceived scientific results. As an elementary test, we twenty-one astronomers with varied experience in studying resolved galaxies and circumstances, have each assessed 200 galaxy images, spanning the early phase of bar evolution in two different barred galaxy simulations. We find variations exist within the classification of all the standard bar parameters assessed: bar length, axis-ratio, pitch-angle and even whether a bar is present at all. If this is indicative of the wider community, it has implications for interpreting morphological trends, such as bar-end effects. Furthermore, we find that it is surprisingly not expertise but gender, followed by career stage, which gives rise to the largest discrepancies in the reported bar parameters. Currently, automation does not seem to be a viable solution, with bar classifications from two automated bar-finding algorithms tested and failing to find bars in snapshots where most astronomers agree a bar must exist. Increasing dependence on machine learning or crowdsourcing with a training dataset can only serve to obfuscate any existing biases if these originate from the specific astronomer producing the training material. On the strength of this small sample, we encourage an interim best practice to reduce the impact of any possible classification bias and set goals for the community to resolve the issue in the future.",

Meier Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present imaging spectroscopy of the \"supernebula\" in the nearby dwarf galaxy NGC 5253 with the MIRI-MRS integral field spectrometer of the JWST. NGC 5253 is host to an luminous ($L\\sim 10^9~\\rm L_\\odot$) HII region, powered by a giant young star cluster, a possible local analogue to super star cluster formation at Cosmic Dawn and Noon. In this paper, the first in a series about the mid-infrared line and continuum emission in the center of NGC 5253, we present an overview and continuum spectra. The mid-infrared images reveal four sources of continuum emission from hot dust that we identify as luminous HII regions, which are used to define spectral apertures. The dominant continuum source is the pc-scale supernebula core seen at radio wavelengths. We find that the MIR to radio continuum flux ratio for all regions is identical to that of Galactic HII regions. The 9.7 silicate feature is present and strongest in absorption toward the supernebula. Silicate emission is seen in another HII region. PAH features are present, although weak, particularly in the supernebula; the strongest emission is in an HII region only 15 pc from the supernebula core. PAH features at 6.2$\\mu$m and 11.3$\\mu$m are detected in all sources. Comparison of the luminosity implied by the ionization to the observed infrared luminosity suggest that at least 25% ofthe photons are escaping the embedded supernebula core, in spite of its high, $A_V\\gtrsim 15$, extinction.",

Nebular conditions are consistent with young ($\\lesssim5\\times10^6$ years) and very massive stars.

      "abstract": "Impact of selection criteria on the structural parameters of the Galactic thin and thick discs Simon Alinder, Thomas Bensby, Paul McMillan Submitted to A&A. Abstract abridged Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Context: The Milky Way contains a thick and a thin disc that differ in chemical, kinematic, structural, and spatial properties. There is significant overlap in the distributions of these properties, especially so at higher metallicities. Distinguishing between these major structural components is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of the Galaxy. Multiple selection methods exist to classify stars as thin or thick disc stars, each with its own advantages and limitations. Aims: We investigate how different classification methods for categorising stars into the thick and thin disc populations influence the determination of structural properties of the two discs. Methods: We apply five different selection methods. Two methods use cuts in the [$\\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] and [Mg/Mn]-[Al/Fe] planes; one uses a dynamical separation in $J_\\phi$ -$J_Z$ space; one uses an age-based cut; and the last one uses a kinematic likelihood method. For each method, we derive relative density profiles of each component as functions of height above the Galactic plane and Galactocentric radius, and fit these to a simple two-exponential disc model. We use red giant stars from APOGEE DR17 and stellar ages from astroNN. Results: Methods based on abundance or age data produce the cleanest separations, while kinematic and dynamical methods suffer higher contamination due to difficulties in separating well-mixed populations. The thin disc scale heights show a clear flaring as they increase with radius, while the thick disc stays approximately constant at around 1 kpc over most radii for all methods. All methods find the thin disc to have a longer scale length than the thick disc, with the difference being greatest for the chemical selection methods. A scale length of the thick disc of 2.0 kpc leads to one of between 2.3 and 3.0 kpc for the thin disc.",

These substructures, identified in our previous studies, are located in the solar neighbourhood and therefore have high-precision astrometry from Gaia. The uncertainties of the results are determined using the Monte Carlo method, and the significance is established through comparison with random halo samples. The results for the substructure GL-1 in both directions show good consistency and high significance ($4.4\\sigma$ and $4.5\\sigma$), yielding a combined accretion time of $5.59^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$ Gyr ago. The substructures GL-4 and GR-1, with smaller pericenters, exhibit higher significance in the less massive potential of the Milky Way, implying that the more massive potential may overestimate the central mass, especially the bulge. The accretion times of GL-4 and GR-1 are $4.0 \\pm 0.2$ Gyr with a confidence of $3.3\\sigma$, and $2.3 \\pm 0.1$ Gyr with a confidence of $3.7\\sigma$, respectively. Further constraints on the accretion times of phase-space substructures require more precise astrometric data, e.g., by Gaia DR4, China Space Station Survey Telescope and Roman space telescope.",

This study aims to explore the intrinsic mechanisms of CLAGNs by investigating their photometric variability using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which has provided high-cadence observations over the past five years. By visual inspections, we construct a sample of 152 CLAGNs from the literature, all of which show spectral transitions and large optical variability in their ZTF light curves. By analyzing 90 of these CLAGNs and the control samples of Type 1 AGNs, Type 2 AGNs, and extremely variable quasars (EVQs), matched in redshift ($0.2<z<0.8$) and supermassive black hole mass, we compare the color variability, structure function (SF), and variability metric $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{QSO}}$, which quantifies how closely the light curves resemble a damped random walk (DRW) model. We find that while CLAGNs and EVQs differ from typical Type 1 and Type 2 AGNs in bolometric luminosity and Eddington ratio, the on/off-state CLAGNs share similar variability patterns with the overall CLAGN population, and distinct from EVQ, Type 1 and Type 2 AGNs. This suggests that 'on' and 'off' CLAGNs are not simply equivalent to Type 1 and Type 2 AGNs, respectively. Instead of undergoing genuine transitions between two AGN types, CLAGNs may inhabit a critical state where moderate fluctuations in accretion rate lead to the temporary spectral changes.",

Tong, Miguel Pereira-Santaella 17 pages, 14 figures, 5 tables; Submitted to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Current spatially resolved kinematic measurements of supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses are largely confined to the local Universe (distances $\\lesssim100$ Mpc). We investigate the potential of the Extremely Large Telescope's (ELT) first-light instruments, MICADO and HARMONI, to extend these dynamical measurements to galaxies at redshift $1\\lesssim z\\lesssim2$. We select a sample of five bright, massive, quiescent galaxies at these redshifts, adopting their Sérsic profiles from HST photometry as their intrinsic surface brightness distributions. Based on these intrinsic models, we generate mock MICADO images using SimCADO and mock HARMONI integral-field spectroscopic data cubes using HSIM. The HARMONI simulations utilize input stellar kinematics derived from Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM). We then process these mock observations: the simulated MICADO images are fitted with Multi-Gaussian Expansion to derive stellar mass models, and stellar kinematics are extracted from mock HARMONI cubes with pPXF. Finally, these derived stellar mass models and kinematics are used to constrain JAM dynamical models within a Bayesian framework. Our analysis demonstrates that SMBH masses can be recovered with an accuracy of $\\sim$10%. We find that MICADO can provide detailed stellar mass models with $\\sim$1 hour of on-source exposure. HARMONI requires longer minimum integrations for reliable stellar kinematic measurements of SMBHs. The required on-source time scales with apparent brightness, ranging from 5-7.5 hours for galaxies at $z\\approx1$ (F814W, 20-20.5 mag) to 5 hours for galaxies at $1<z\\lesssim2$ (F160W, 20.8 mag). These findings highlight the ELT's capability to push the frontier of SMBH mass measurements to $z\\approx2$, enabling crucial tests of SMBH-galaxy co-evolution at the top end of the galaxy mass function.",

      "abstract": "How much can we learn from resolved stellar kinematics of galactic haloes using action-based dynamical models? Paula Gherghinescu, Eugene Vasiliev, Payel Das, Justin Read Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Dynamical models are used to study dark matter (DM) in galaxies, how galaxies assemble through mergers, and to test galaxy formation models. Despite its widespread use, there has been no systematic study quantifying how much information can be obtained from just two on-sky positions and line-of-sight velocities, which are typically available for nearby external galaxies. In this work, we introduce axisymmetric, action-based dynamical models that use the positions and velocities of stellar halo stars to jointly constrain the total mass distribution of galaxies and the underlying DM component, as well as the stellar halo phase-space distribution. We rigorously test the method using both idealised equilibrium galaxy mocks and cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the Auriga suite, systematically assessing how its performance degrades as the available phase-space information is progressively reduced. We further examine the impact of galaxy inclination, modelling assumptions, and methodological systematics on the recovered mass profiles. A crucial development in this work is the improved marginalisation of the model likelihood over missing phase-space dimensions. Our models successfully recover the total and DM mass distributions, as well as the kinematic properties of the stellar tracers, within the derived confidence intervals. However, we find that with limited (3D or 4D) phase-space information, the flattening of the DM halo cannot be constrained with any degree of certainty. Nevertheless, the recovered mass profile is insensitive to the flattening. This finding is independently validated by Schwarzschild modelling tests.",

Under given ionization conditions, significant galaxy-to-galaxy variations are identified, and are primarily attributed to variations of intercept $b$, which exhibits clear bimodality. This bimodality is related to the overall host galaxy star formation strength. The differences in slope $k$ and intrinsic scatter $\\sigma$ across different MIR bands (${I_{\\rm F770W, PAH}}$, ${I_{\\rm F1130W}}$, and ${I_{\\rm F2100W}}$) are minor compared to their galaxy-to-galaxy variations. All parameters ($k$, $b$, and $\\sigma$) depend on the spatial scale of measurement, suggesting that the coupling among CO, PAH, and dust is regulated by different mechanisms at varying scales. We identify non-log-linear behaviors in the brightest regions, where deviations are primarily characterized by flattening of slope. No significant (3$\\sigma$) correlations are found between global properties and the best-fit parameters.

Pudritz 23 pages, 19 figures, 5 tables. In revision with ApJ after first referee report Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) There is abundant observational evidence for the hierarchical, interconnected nature of filaments in the interstellar medium (ISM) extending from galactic down to sub-parsec scales. New JWST images of NGC 628 in particular, show clusters forming along the two spiral arms of this galaxy. In this paper we investigate filament and cluster properties in an NGC 628-like multi-scale high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulation. We use a filament finding tool to identify filaments and derive the probability density functions (PDFs) for the filament lengths and masses. Using a clustering algorithm we identify star clusters formed between 268 to 278 Myr and follow this population as the galaxy evolves for 60 Myr, calculating their mass PDFs, average radius growth rate, and average mass loss rate. We find a power-law index of alpha_m = -1.35 for the filament masses. Calculating the power-law index from our cluster mass PDF, we find a value of alpha_{c,m} = -1.35 when the clusters first form, exactly our filament mass power-law index. This shows that properties of young clusters arise from the gravitational fragmentation of their host filaments. We track the post-formation evolution of the clusters as they become unbound, increase in radius and decrease in mass yielding an ever steeper mass power-law index. After 60 Myr, the mass power-law index is alpha_{c,m} = -1.55, matching other simulations and observations.",

Based on the age of stars in these galaxies at $z=0$, $40-100\\%$ of their stellar mass was formed by the time of reionization, when star formation (SF) abruptly shuts down. Depending on their halo mass evolution, some of the dwarfs reignite SF post-reionization (rejuvenators), while others remain quenched for the rest of cosmic time (reionization relics). However, the stellar mass of relics can still grow by more than $50\\%$ through mergers post-reionisation. We find clear correlations between metallicity distributions of the galaxies and the fraction of stars formed post-reionization ($f_{\\rm post-reio}^\\star$) such that relics have lower median $\\rm [Fe/H]$ with a more prominent low metallicity tail. Moreover, the shape of the galaxies at $z=0$ correlates with their $f_{\\rm post-reio}^\\star$, with rejuvenators showing more spherical stellar distribution than relics. This difference arises only post-reionization when rejuvenators become rounder with more SF activity. Similarly, the shape of dark matter (DM) halos in the inner regions display more spherical distributions in rejuvenators than in relics. The shape evolution shows that DM haloes in all galaxy formation simulations become rounder in comparison to their collision-less, DM-only counterparts. However, DM haloes of rejuvenators evolve more significantly. We do not find any correlation between SF activity and formation of shallow DM density cores in these galaxies. These predictions can be tested using upcoming observational data. In particular, our results indicate that the scatter in the mass-metallicity relation in the low mass regime is correlated with SF histories and the shape of galaxies.",

Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Warm ionized gas is ubiquitous at the centers of X-ray bright elliptical galaxies. While it is believed to play a key role in the feeding and feedback processes of supermassive black holes, its origins remain under debate. Existing studies have primarily focused on the morphology and kinematics of warm ionized gas. This work aims to provide a new perspective on warm (10,000 K) ionized gas and its connection to X-ray-emitting hot gas (>10^6 K) by measuring and comparing their metallicities. We conducted a joint analysis of 13 massive elliptical galaxies using MUSE/VLT and Chandra observations. Emission-line ratios were measured for the warm ionized gas using MUSE observation, and used to infer the ionization mechanisms and derive metallicities of the warm ionized gas using HII, and LIN(E)R calibrations. We also computed the warm phase metallicity using X-ray/EUV, and pAGB stars models. For two sources at higher redshift, direct Te method was also used to measure warm gas metallicities. Our observations reveal that most sources exhibit composite ionization, with contributions from both star formation and LINER-like emission. A positive linear correlation was found between the gas-phase metallicities of the warm and hot phases, ranging from 0.3 to 1.5 Zsun, and suggest the intimate connection between the two gas phases, likely driven by gas cooling and/or mixing. In some sources the warm gas metallicity shows a central drop. A similar radial trend has been reported for the hot gas metallicity in some galaxy clusters. The ionization mechanisms of cooling flow elliptical galaxies are diverse, suggesting multiple channels for powering the warm ionized gas. The large variation in the warm gas metallicity further suggests that cold gas mass derived under the assumption of solar metallicity for the CO-to-H2 conversion factor needs to be revised by approximately an order of magnitude.",

Williams 18 pages, 8 figures, submitted, version after addressing referee comments Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present the first localized detections of the cold neutral medium (CNM) in IC10, offering a rare view of dense atomic gas in a low-metallicity (0.27 solar metallicity) dwarf galaxy. As a low-metallicity starburst, IC10's interstellar medium conditions could reflect small-scale physical conditions that mirror those of early galaxies, providing a unique window into the heating and cooling processes that shaped the interstellar medium in early-Universe environments. Leveraging the high angular (<5'' ~ 15pc) and spectral (0.4 km/s) resolution of the Local Group L-band Survey, we searched for HI absorption against nine continuum radio sources and detected absorption along three sightlines corresponding to internal radio emission sources within IC10. Using Gaussian decomposition and radiative transfer, we characterize the CNM, deriving spin temperatures of ~30-55 K, column densities of (0.6-3.0)x 1$0^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, cold HI fractions of ~ 21-37%, and line widths of ~ 5.6-13.6 km/s. For each individual detection of HI absorption, we find corresponding molecular emission from 12CO (J=1-0), HCO+ (J=1-0), and HCN (J=1-0) at similar velocities and with comparable linewidths, indicating a well-mixed atomic and molecular medium. In IC10, the CNM shows a clear kinematic connection to the high-density ISM, implying a stronger dynamical coupling with molecular gas than in the Milky Way, in line with expectations for low-metallicity environments. At the ~ 15 pc scales probed by slightly extended HII regions in IC10, unresolved CNM clouds likely contribute to line blending, so the observed broad HI linewidths may partly reflect spatial and kinematic averaging.",

Wilner 24 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The sulfur chemistry in protoplanetary disks influences the properties of nascent planets, including potential habitability. Although the inventory of sulfur molecules in disks has gradually increased over the last decade, CS is still the most commonly-observed sulfur-bearing species and it is expected to be the dominant gas-phase sulfur carrier beyond the water snowline. Despite this, few dedicated multi-line observations exist, and thus the typical disk CS chemistry is not well constrained. Moreover, it is unclear how that chemistry - and in turn, the bulk volatile sulfur reservoir - varies with stellar and disk properties. Here, we present the largest survey of CS to date, combining both new and archival observations from ALMA, SMA, and NOEMA of 12 planet-forming disks, covering a range of stellar spectral types and dust morphologies. Using these data, we derived disk-integrated CS gas excitation conditions in each source. Overall, CS chemistry appears similar across our sample with rotational temperatures of ${\\approx}$10-40 K and column densities between 10$^{12}$-10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. CS column densities do not show strong trends with most source properties, which broadly suggests that CS chemistry is not highly sensitive to disk structure or stellar characteristics. We do, however, identify a positive correlation between stellar X-ray luminosity and CS column density, which indicates that the dominant CS formation pathway is likely via ion-neutral reactions in the upper disk layers, where X-ray-enhanced S$^+$ and C$^+$ drive abundant CS production. Thus, using CS as a tracer of gas-phase sulfur abundance requires a nuanced approach that accounts for its emitting region and dependence on X-ray luminosity.",

Potential applications in the search for chemically peculiar stars in large spectroscopic surveys Theosamuele Signor, Paula Jofré, Hernan Lira, Sara Vitali, Luis Martí, Nayat Sánchez-Pi 16 pages, 11 figures, accepted on A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Chemical abundance determinations from stellar spectra are challenged by observational noise, limitations in stellar models, and departures from simplifying assumptions. While traditional and supervised machine learning methods have made remarkable progress in estimating atmospheric parameters and chemical compositions within existing physical models, these factors still constrain our ability to fully exploit the vast data sets provided by modern spectroscopic surveys. We aim to develop a self-supervised, disentangled representation learning framework that extracts chemically meaningful features directly from spectra, without relying on externally imposed label catalogs. We build a variational autoencoder-based representation learning model with physics-inspired structure: multiple decoders each focus on spectral regions dominated by a particular element, enforcing that each latent dimension maps to a single abundance. To evaluate the potential application of our framework, we trained and validated the model on low-resolution, low signal-to-noise synthetic spectra focusing on $\\rm [Fe/H]$, $\\rm [C/Fe]$, and $\\rm [\\alpha/Fe]$. We then demonstrate how the trained model can be used to flag stars as chemically enhanced or depleted in these abundances based on their position within the latent distribution. Our model successfully learns a representation of spectra whose axes correlate tightly with the target abundances ($r=0.92\\pm0.01$ for $\\rm [Fe/H]$, $r=0.92\\pm0.01$ for $\\rm [C/Fe]$, $r=0.82\\pm0.02$ for $\\rm [\\alpha/Fe]$). The disentangled representations provide a robust means to distinguish stars based on their chemical properties, offering an efficient and scalable solution for large spectroscopic surveys.",

Ferraro, Alessio Mucciarelli, Barbara Lanzoni, Mario Cadelano, Israel Trangolao 7 pages, 8 figures. Accepted for publication in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) In this work we study the rotational velocities of a sample of blue straggler stars (BSSs) and reference stars belonging to the Galactic globular cluster NGC 1851, using high-resolution spectra acquired with FLAMES-GIRAFFE at the ESO/VLT. After field decontamination based on radial velocities and proper motions, the final sample of member stars is composed of 15 BSSs and 45 reference stars populating the red giant and horizontal branches of the cluster. In agreement with previous findings, the totality of reference stars has negligible rotation (lower than 15 km/s). In contrast, we find high values of rotational velocity (up to $\\sim$ 150 km/s) for a sub-sample of BSSs. By defining the threshold for fast rotating BSSs at 40 km/s, we found 4 fast-rotating BSSs out of 15, corresponding to a percentage of 27 $\\pm$ 14 %. This results delineates a monotonically decreasing trend (instead of a step function) between the percentage of fast spinning BSSs and the central concentration and density of the host cluster, supporting a scenario where recent BSS formation preferentially occurs in low-density environments from the evolution of binary systems.",

Special attention is paid to analysis of the magnetic fields and their possible connection with maser flares. For this purpose, we estimate the distance from star to maser, the magnetospheric radius and magnetic field strength in the region of this radius. The distances from stars to masing regions lie in range from 380 to 620 au. Stellar and disk's magnetic field strengths are comparable at the magnetosphere boundary and lie in the range from 590 to 1880 G for considered objects. Our estimates show that the magnetic fields may play an important role in the considered regions. In particular, observed luminosity bursts and maser flares may be related to magnetic reconnection events near the stars.",

      "abstract": "VELOCE III. Reconstructing Radial Velocity Curves of Classical Cepheids Giordano Viviani, Richard I. Anderson Submitted to A&A. Comments are welcome Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a novel framework for accurately reconstructing radial velocity (RV) curves of classical Cepheids (Cepheids) from sparsely sampled time-series data suitable for application in large spectroscopic surveys. The framework provides a set of priors for the principal components of RV curves established based on high-precision measurements from the VELOCE project; template RV curves of Cepheids can be readily extracted from our results. We demonstrate the ability of our framework to estimate unbiased pulsation average velocities, $v_\\gamma$, to within $20-30$m/s, and peak-to-peak amplitudes, $P2P$, to within $\\sim 2\\%$. Subsampling the initial data set, we show that $v_\\gamma$ and $P2P$ can be determined to within $\\sim 0.35$ km/s and $\\sim 6-7\\%$, respectively, from as few as three observations. We fitted existing time-series RV data of Cepheids in the LMC and SMC using this framework and obtained typical RMSE of $0.5-2.0$ km/s. The typical total uncertainty on $v_\\gamma$ achieved for the SMC Cepheids is $\\sim 0.85$ km/s, providing sensitivity to spectroscopic binaries (SB). We identified 8 SB1 systems; two and one of which are new detections in the LMC and SMC, respectively. This yields a single-lined SB fraction of $\\sim 25\\%$ and $29\\%$ in the two galaxies, similar to the Milky Way's SB fraction of $29\\%$ established as part of VELOCE. Despite their relatively small number, LMC Cepheids reproduce the known line-of-sight component of the LMC's large-scale rotation, which differs in the extremes by more than $80$km/s. The kinematics of the SMC are more complex and not sufficiently sampled by the available Cepheids. Our framework is designed to yield accurate $v_\\gamma$ and $P2P$ of Cepheids observed by large spectroscopic surveys, such as 4MOST, SDSS-V, and others, and will unlock new insights into the kinematics and multiplicity of evolved intermediate-mass stellar populations.",

The emulator accurately reproduces the thermochemical evolution over a wide density range spanning 21 orders of magnitude (10$^{-3}$-10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$), tracking six primordial species: H, H$_2$, e$^{-}$, H$^{+}$, H$^{-}$, and H$_2^{+}$. To handle the broad dynamic range, we partition the density range into five subregions and train separate deep operator networks (DeepONets) in each region. When applied to randomly sampled thermochemical states, the emulator achieves relative errors below 10% in over 90% of cases for both temperature and chemical abundances (except for the rare species H$_2^{+}$). The emulator is roughly ten times faster on a CPU and more than 1000 times faster for batched predictions on a GPU, compared with conventional numerical integration. Furthermore, to ensure robust predictions under many iterations, we introduce a novel timescale-based update method, where a short-timestep update of each variable is computed by rescaling the predicted change over a longer timestep equal to its characteristic variation timescale. In one-zone collapse calculations, the results from the timescale-based method agree well with traditional numerical integration even with many iterations at a timestep as short as 10$^{-4}$ of the free-fall time. This proof-of-concept study suggests the potential for neural network-based chemical emulators to accelerate hydrodynamic simulations of star formation.",

Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) JWST has identified some of the Universe's earliest galaxies, repeatedly pushing the frontier to ever higher redshifts and stellar masses. The presence of such extreme galaxies at such early times, with large stellar populations and high star-formation rates, naturally results in a tension between observation and theory. This tension between numerical models and observations can be either due to our underlying cosmological models or due to a gap in our understanding of early Universe astrophysics. In a prelude to this letter, we showed how the Renaissance simulations, which focused on high redshift galaxy formation were able to reconstruct similar stellar masses to the earliest and highest mass galaxies that had been discovered by JWST at the time of its publication (McCaffrey et al.2023). Since then many more galaxies have been discovered by JWST, in particular the \"Mirage-or-Miracle\" (MoM) survey broke the record recently with the highest redshift galaxy MoM-z14, which has a spectroscopically confirmed redshift of $z \\sim 14.44$ followed closely by GS-z14 with a spectroscopically confirmed redshift of $z \\sim 14.3$. We investigate in this letter whether these newly discovered galaxies are in conflict with the Renaissance simulations and thus whether they are causing tension with our established models of cosmology and/or high-redshift astrophysics. We discover that MoM-z14's high mass at early redshift can be explained by the Renaissance simulation suite, whereas the extremely high stellar mass of GS-z14 remains an outlier when compared to previous measurements of high-redshift galaxies detected by JWST and our numerical models (even after accounting for cosmic variance).",

We exploit the ASTRODEEP-JWST photometric catalogs to single out robust candidates, including sources quenched only a few tens of Myr before the observation. We apply a SED-fitting procedure which explores three functional forms of star formation history and the $\\chi^2$ probabilities of the solutions, with additional checks to minimise the contamination from interlopers, tuning our selection criteria against available spectroscopic data from the DAWN archive and simulated catalogs. We select 633 candidates, which we rank by a reliability parameter based on the probabilities of the quiescent and alternative star-forming solutions, with 291 candidates tagged as \"gold\". According to the best-fit models, 79\\% of the massive ($\\log(M_\\ast/M_\\odot) \\geq 10.5$) quiescent galaxies at $3 < z < 5$ stopped forming stars at least 150 Myr before the time of observation, while 89\\% of low-mass sources have been quenched for less than 150 Myr. The abundance of low-mass old quiescent systems does not increase significantly with time from $z = 5$ to 3: low-mass objects seem to be experiencing a short episode of quenching followed by rejuvenation (``breathing''), consistent with a downsizing scenario of galaxy formation. We also find an abrupt drop in the density of massive quiescent candidates at $z > 5$. We derive estimates for the number density of early passive galaxies up to $z = 10$ and compare them against various models: tensions with data remain in the modeling of the observed bimodality of time passed since quenching as a function of mass.",

      "abstract": "The effect of mass and morphology on the mass assembly of galaxies A. Camps-Fariña, R. M. Mérida, P. Sánchez Blázquez, S. F. Sánchez Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The pace at which galaxies grew into their current stellar masses and how this growth is regulated is still not fully understood, nor is the role that morphology plays in this process. We applied full spectral fitting techniques with pyPipe3D to the MaNGA sample to obtain its star formation and stellar mass histories and used these to investigate the mass assembly of galaxies by measuring how their specific star formation correlates to their stellar mass at different look-back times. We find that the correlation between these two parameters was shallower in the past. Galaxies used to have similar mass doubling times and the current negative correlation between the specific star formation and M* is primarily due to more massive galaxies 'dropping' off the main sequence earlier than less massive ones. Additionally, selecting the galaxies into bins based on their present-day morphology shows a segregation in specific star formation rate (sSFR) that is maintained even at high look-back times, showing that the factors that determine which morphology a galaxy ends up in are in place at very early times. Similarly, selecting them based on their current star formation status shows that, on average, currently retired galaxies used to have slightly a higher sSFR before the drop-off, whereas galaxies that have continued to form stars until today had a lower sSFR initially. We compare our results to a set of cosmic surveys, finding partial agreement in our results with several of them, though with significant offsets in redshift. Finally, we discuss how our results fit with certain theoretical models on galaxy evolution as well as cosmological simulations.",

Angulo Submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics. 16 figures, 5tables Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Wide-field, multi-filter photometric surveys enable the reconstruction of the Milky Way's star formation history (SFH) on Galactic scales and offer new insights into disc assembly. The twelve-filter system of the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) is particularly suitable, as its colours trace stellar chemical abundances and help alleviate the age-metallicity degeneracy in colour-magnitude diagram fitting. We aim to recover the SFH of the Galactic disc and separate its chemically distinct components by combining J-PLUS DR3 photometry with Gaia astrometry. We also evaluate the potential of isochrone fitting to estimate stellar ages and metallicities as proxies for evolutionary trends. We fit magnitudes and parallaxes of $1.38\\times10^{6}$ stars using a Bayesian multiple isochrone method. The bright region of the colour-absolute-magnitude diagram ($M_{r}\\leq4.2$ mag) constrains ages, while the faint region provides an empirical metallicity prior mitigating the age-metallicity degeneracy. Both PARSEC and BaSTI isochrones, in solar-scaled and $\\alpha$-enhanced forms, are adopted. The recovered SFH reveals two sequences: an $\\alpha$-enhanced population forming rapidly between $12.5$ and $8$ Gyr ago, enriching from [M/H]$\\sim-0.6$ to $0.1$ dex; and a solar-scaled sequence emerging $\\sim8$ Gyr ago, dominating after $\\sim7$ Gyr with slower enrichment reaching solar metallicity by $3$ Gyr. Metal-rich ([M/H]$\\gtrsim0$) stars are confined to $\\vert z_{GC}\\vert\\lesssim1$ kpc, whereas metal-poor ([M/H]$\\lesssim-0.5$) stars reach $\\vert z_{GC}\\vert\\sim2$ kpc. Simultaneous fitting of both isochrone families reveals distinct formation epochs for the thin and thick discs. J-PLUS multi-filter photometry, combined with Gaia parallaxes, mitigates age-metallicity degeneracies and enables detailed mapping of the Milky Way's temporal and chemical evolution.",

Keck data, taken 8 years after the event, reveal a strong lens detection enabling a direct measurement of lens flux and source-lens relative proper motion. We find the relative source-lens proper motion to be $\\mu_{\\rm rel, Hel} = 4.07 \\pm 0.34\\ \\rm mas\\ yr^{-1}$, with the lens being $\\sim10$ times fainter than the source. The lens was very faint in the Hubble passbands, and the small lens-source separation of $\\sim$35 mas made its detection difficult. However, we obtained estimates of the lens magnitudes in Hubble bands by constraining its location to match the Keck K-band detection. The original analysis by \\citet{Furusawa2013} reports a degenerate light curve, with several viable models depending on higher-order effects. We attempt to break the degeneracy by remodeling the event using constraints from follow-up data. Our best fit model includes parallax, orbital motion, xallarap and the magnification of a source companion. Models omitting any of these are excluded. However, even with a lens detection the solution remains unclear, as the degeneracy between a nearby late M dwarf and a distant early M dwarf in the disk persists, and cannot be broken with NIR data alone. We conclude the lens is either a $\\sim0.2\\ M_{\\odot}$ star at $2-3$kpc, or a $\\sim0.5\\ M_{\\odot}$ star at $4-5$kpc.

We explain the anti-tail as an anisotropic extension of the snow line, or survival radius of a sublimating ice grain, in the direction of the Sun. The anisotropy is due to the difference in the sublimation mass flux in the solar and perpendicular directions caused by the change in the illumination angle of the cometary surface. The stronger sublimation mass flux in the solar direction results in ice grains with larger sizes, longer sublimation lifetimes, and a snow line at a larger radial distance with respect to other directions. The observed radial surface brightness profiles as a function of illumination angle are well reproduced by a Haser-type radial outflow with constant velocity and sublimating ice grains with angularly dependent survival lengths.",

Abstract shortened to meet arXiv requirements Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Asymmetries in the observed rotational splittings of a multiplet contain information about the star's rotation profile and internal magnetic field. However, to exploit this information, highly accurate theoretical predictions are needed. We aim to quantify the difference in the predicted mode asymmetries between a 1D perturbative method, and a 2D method that includes a 2D stellar structure model, which takes rotation into account. We then put these differences in the context of asteroseismic measurements of internal magnetic fields. We couple the 1D pulsation codes GYRE and StORM to the 2D stellar structure code ESTER and compare the oscillation predictions with the results from the 2D TOP pulsation code. We focus on ZAMS models representative of rotating $\\beta$~Cephei pulsators, going up to 20% of the critical rotation rate. We find a generally good agreement between the oscillation frequencies resulting from the 1D and 2D pulsation codes. Since the magnetic asymmetries are small compared to the differences in the rotational asymmetries resulting from the 1D and 2D predictions, accurate measurements of the magnetic field are in most cases challenging. Differences in the predicted mode asymmetries between 1D perturbative methods and 2D non-perturbative methods can greatly hinder accurate measurements of internal magnetic fields in main-sequence pulsators with low-order modes. Nevertheless, reasonably accurate measurements could be possible with $n_{pg} \\ge 2$ modes if the internal rotation is roughly below 10% of the critical rotation frequency for (aligned) magnetic fields on the order of a few hundred kG. While the differences between the 1D and 2D predictions are mostly too large for internal magnetic field detections, the rotational asymmetries predicted by StORM are in general accurate enough for asteroseismic modelling of the stellar rotation in main-sequence stars.",

Tegnell Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) The CLEAR Space Weather Center of Excellence's solar energetic particle (SEP) prediction model, SOlar wind with FIeld lines and Energetic particles (SOFIE), was run and evaluated on-site during the Space Weather Prediction Testbed (SWPT) exercise at NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) in May 2025. As a physics-based SEP simulation and prediction model, SOFIE simulates the acceleration and transport of energetic particles in the coronal mass ejection (CME) driven shock in the solar corona and inner heliosphere. It has been validated against historical events. However, questions remain regarding whether a physics-based model, traditionally considered computationally expensive, could meet operational needs. The SWPT exercise offered a valuable opportunity to evaluate SOFIE's performance under simulated real-time conditions. Interactive feedback during the exercise from SWPC forecasters, SRAG console operators, CCMC personnel, and M2M SWAO analysts led to significant strategic improvements in the model setup to meet operational requirements. The resolution of the simulation domain was optimized by combining a coarser background grid with higher-resolution regions along the CME path and facing toward Earth, reducing computational cost without compromising accuracy. In this work, we present the operational performance of SOFIE and its capability to predict SEP fluxes significantly faster than real time. SOFIE was able to complete a 4-day SEP simulation within 5 hours on a supercomputer with 1,000 CPU cores during the SWPT exercise. This marks a critical milestone in demonstrating both the robustness and operational usefulness of SOFIE to support future human space exploration.",

Our work aims to understand how such flows modify wave propagation and damping in environments where ion-neutral collisions are significant. We employ a two-fluid model that treats ions and neutrals as separate, colliding fluids and incorporates background steady flows for both species. Using a combination of analytical dispersion analysis and numerical solutions, we examine the impact of these flows on the behaviour of Alfvén waves. Our results show that steady flows lead to substantial modifications of wave properties, including Doppler shifts, propagation direction reversal, flow-dependent changes in damping rates, and the appearance of a new mode associated with neutral flow and collisional coupling. We also identify conditions under which flow-driven mode conversion can arise. Our results offer new insights into the interplay between plasma flows and particle collisions in the regions of the solar atmosphere where partial ionisation is relevant.",

Zarka Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Radio emission from star planet interactions (SPI) beyond our solar system has yet to be firmly detected, primarily due to challenges such as weak signals, directional beaming effects, and low frequency emissions that are blocked by the ionosphere of Earth. Addressing these obstacles calls for strategic target selection. This proof of concept study aims to improve SPI target prioritization by simulating SPI induced radio emission frequencies and estimating associated radio power to identify systems most likely to produce detectable signals. We combine Zeeman Doppler Imaging (ZDI) maps with 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stellar wind simulations and use the ExPRES code to model SPI driven radio emissions. We also estimate the intensity of these emissions using the Radio Magnetic Scaling Law, based on the magnetic field and plasma density parameters from the 3D wind models. This approach is applied to systems such as Tau Boo, HD 179949, and HD 189733 to assess their detectability with current and future radio telescopes. This framework, tested on benchmark systems, is applicable to any star planet system with available ZDI maps and wind models. As magnetic field reconstructions and wind simulations improve, the method will become more robust. It provides a data driven approach to prioritize targets and optimize telescope scheduling. This shall enable systematic exploration of magnetic SPI radio emissions across a wide range of exoplanetary systems.",

However, interpreting such polarization requires a rigorous treatment of isotropic depolarizing collisions between O\\,\\textsc{i} atoms and neutral hydrogen. Aims: We aim to investigate the combined effects of collisional and magnetic depolarization in shaping the alignment of O\\,\\textsc{i} levels (and thus the polarization of the O\\,\\textsc{i} IR triplet). Methods: We compute, for the first time, a comprehensive set of collisional depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the relevant O\\,\\textsc{i} energy levels. These rates are incorporated into a multi-level atomic model, and the statistical equilibrium equations (SEE) are solved to quantify the impact of collisions and magnetic fields on atomic alignment. Results: Our calculations indicate that elastic collisions with neutral hydrogen, together with the Hanle effect of turbulent magnetic fields stronger than about 20 G, efficiently suppress the bulk of the atomic alignment in deep photospheric conditions where hydrogen densities exceed $n_{\\mathrm{H}} \\sim 10^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$. In the chromosphere, however, the lower hydrogen density weakens collisional depolarization, allowing polarization to persist. Conclusions: Our results are consistent with a chromospheric origin for the linear polarization signals of the O I IR triplet. Future studies should combine accurate non-LTE radiative transfer with reliable collisional rates in order to achieve fully consistent modeling.",

The presence of a stellar companion can strongly influence the architecture and long-term stability of planetary systems. Motivated by the discovery of exoplanets exhibiting extremely high eccentricities (e >= 0.8) in systems with a binary companion, we investigate how planetary orbits around one star (S-type configuration) evolve under the gravitational perturbations of the companion. Aims. We aim to assess the role of a stellar companion in shaping the orbital evolution of S-type planets and to explore whether dynamical interactions in such environments can account for the formation of highly eccentric planets. Methods. We performed a suite of N-body simulations, modeling systems initially composed of three Jupiter-mass planets on nearly circular, coplanar orbits around the primary star. We systematically varied the semi-major axis, eccentricity, and inclination of the stellar companion, to characterize the conditions under which extreme eccentricities can be excited. Results. Our results show that dynamical processes such as planet-planet scattering and secular mechanisms--including the von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov effect induced by the binary--often act together to produce abrupt and significant changes in planetary orbital evolution, with the outcome strongly dependent on the binary separation. The binary's eccentricity primarily dictates the number of surviving planets, while its inclination not only governs the final eccentricities of those survivors but also drives their orbits to align with the binary plane. Our simulations successfully reproduce the high eccentricities and compact orbits observed in four observed systems, showing close agreement between the modeled configurations and the actual systems.",

In this work, we demonstrate that conventional numerical schemes are excessively dissipative in this low-Mach regime. We demonstrate that a new numerical scheme (termed `USM-BK' and implemented in the FLASH MHD code) reduces the dissipation of kinetic and magnetic energy, constrains the divergence of magnetic field to zero close to machine precision, and resolves smaller-scale structure than other, more conventional schemes, and hence, is the most accurate for simulations of low-Mach turbulent flows among the schemes compared in this work. We first compare several numerical schemes/solvers, including Split-Roe, Split-Bouchut, USM-Roe, USM-HLLC, USM-HLLD, and the new USM-BK, on a simple vortex problem. We then compare the schemes/solvers in simulations of the turbulent dynamo and show that the choice of scheme affects the growth rate, saturation level, and viscous and resistive dissipation scale of the dynamo. We also measure the numerical kinematic Reynolds number (Re) and magnetic Reynolds number (Rm) of our otherwise ideal MHD flows, and show that the new USM-BK scheme provides the highest Re and comparable Rm amongst all the schemes compared.",

Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Astrometry from the Gaia mission has revealed a large population of white dwarf (WD) + main sequence (MS) binaries with periods of $100 - 1000\\,$d. These systems have separations intermediate to predictions from standard binary evolution scenarios, challenging models of binary interaction and mass transfer. Because the selection function of Gaia astrometric catalogs is complex, the underlying population demographics of WD+MS binaries remain imperfectly understood. We present a forward-model of the AU-scale WD+MS binary population probed by Gaia that begins with a realistic binary population and incorporates a full model of Gaia mock observations and astrometric model fitting, as well as cuts employed in producing the Gaia astrometric catalog and selecting WD+MS binary candidates. We model the formation of AU-scale WD+MS binaries as the result of interaction when the WD progenitor is an AGB star. We test several models for the binaries' formation, including stable mass transfer with theoretically predicted stability criteria and two different formalisms for common envelope evolution. None of these models succeed in reproducing the observed component mass distributions or the absolute number of WD+MS binaries. The data are best reproduced by a model in which post-AGB binaries remain wide only if the accretor-to-donor mass ratio exceeds $\\sim 0.4$. Our model allows us to constrain the intrinsic population demographics of intermediate-separation WD+MS binaries. The inferred period distribution is close to flat, with ${\\rm d}N/{\\rm d}P_{\\rm orb}\\propto P_{\\rm orb}^{0.12}$, while the WD mass distribution is sharply peaked at $0.6\\,M_{\\odot}$. The model implies that $\\sim 0.4\\%$ of solar-type stars have WD companions with periods of $100 - 1000\\,$d.",

Here we report optical spectroscopy with KOSMOS (APO), MagE (Magellan) and GHOST (Gemini-S) of ASASSN-24fw (Gaia 07:05:18.97+06:12:19.4), a 4-magnitude dimming event of a main-sequence star which lasted 8.5 months. We discover multiple low-ionization metal emission lines with velocity dispersion $\\lesssim 10$ km/s blue-shifted by 27 km/s with respect to the star, as well as kinematically complex Na D absorption. If associated with the occulter, these detections suggest that the occulter is gas-rich. Further, we detect blue-shifted and broad ($\\sim 200$ km/s) H$\\alpha$ line, which likely originates in the inner circumstellar disk. We confirm the previously reported occultations in 1981 and 1937 seen in historic data, yielding a semi-major axis of the occulter's orbital motion around the star of 14 AU. If the occulter is a circumsecondary disk filling 30-100% of the Hill radius, we estimate the minimum mass of the secondary to be a few Jupiter masses and a disk mass of 1% of the mass of the Moon. Given the age of the star ($>2$ Gyr), the disk is unlikely to be a survivor of the planet formation stage and may be a result of a planetary collision. If Na D absorption and/or metal emission lines originate in the disk, the observations presented here are the first discovery of a circumsecondary disk wind or rotation.",

As one of its key payloads, the Low-energy Polarization Detector (LPD) is designed to perform wide-field surveys to capture X-ray polarization information from gamma-ray bursts in the 2-10 keV energy range. This paper presents Topmetal-L, a dedicated charge-sensitive pixel sensor developed for the LPD prototype upgrade. Fabricated in a 130 nm CMOS process in 2024, the chip integrates a 356 $\\times$ 512 pixel array with a pixel pitch of 45 $\\mu$m. Each pixel incorporates a 26 $\\times$ 26 $\\mu$m^2 charge-collecting electrode window and is capable of simultaneously outputting both energy and position information of deposited charges. Topmetal-L has been systematically optimized for power consumption, noise performance, and readout efficiency. It exhibits an input dynamic range of 0-4 ke-, a typical charge-to-voltage conversion gain of 76.04 $\\mu$V/e-, an average equivalent noise charge of approximately 22.8 e-, a sensitive area exceeding 3.6 cm^2, and a total power consumption of 720 mW per chip. To meet the requirements of large-area, high-frame-rate readout for gas-based polarization detectors, a sentinel-scanning readout scheme is proposed, reducing the full-frame readout time to 730 $\\mu$s. A prototype Topmetal-L-based gas polarization detection system was evaluated across key energies: it exhibited a residual modulation of 0.26% $\\pm$ 0.45% at 5.90 keV, a modulation factor of 66.67% $\\pm$ 0.45% for a linearly polarized 8.0 keV source, and a counting rate saturated at 15 k counts/(cm^2$\\cdot$s) when tested at 5.4 keV.",

However, achieving accurate null depth calibration is challenging due to various noise sources, instrumental imperfections, and the complexity of real observational environments. These challenges necessitate advanced calibration techniques that can efficiently handle such uncertainties while maintaining a high accuracy. This paper aims to incorporate machine-learning techniques with a Bayesian inference to improve the accuracy and efficiency of null depth retrieval in nulling interferometry. Specifically, it explores the use of neural posterior estimation (NPE) to develop models that overcome the computational limitations of conventional methods, such as numerical self-calibration (NSC), providing a more robust solution for accurate null depth calibration. An NPE-based model was developed, with a simulator that incorporates real data to better represent specific conditions. The model was tested on both synthetic and observational data from the LBTI nuller for evaluation. The NPE model successfully demonstrated improved efficiency, achieving results comparable to current methods in use. It achieved a null depth retrieval accuracy down to a few $10^{-4}$ on real observational data, matching the performance of conventional approaches while offering significant computational advantages, reducing the data retrieval time to one-quarter of the time required by self-calibration methods. The NPE model presents a practical and scalable solution for null depth calibration in nulling interferometry, offering substantial improvements in efficiency over existing methods with a better precision and application to other interferometric techniques.",

This paper details the core modules of CPISM that simulate the CPI-C instrument, focusing on the simulation of the high-contrast imaging optical system and the visible-band science camera. We modeled key optical components, such as the transmission apodizing filter, the wavefront corrector, and the focal plane mask using the HCIPy package. A $10^{-8}$ contrast dark hole region, consistent with design specifications, was simulated using the Electric Field Conjugation (EFC) optimization method, and broadband observation effects were considered. For the science camera, which is an electron multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD), we established a detailed model encompassing photon collection, charge transfer, electron multiplication (EM), and readout processes, based on test data. This model simulates complex instrumental features including dark current, charge transfer efficiency, clock-induced charge, multiplication noise factor, and various readout effects like striping and drift. We also proposed and validated an improved statistical model for the EM process to enhance simulation efficiency. CPISM can generate simulated images containing rich instrumental details, closely similar to the expected real observational data, thus laying the foundation for the development and verification of CPI-C data processing algorithms and preparations for future scientific research.",

It is imperative that the raw data collected by HSTDM undergoes meticulous calibration and processing through the HSTDM data processing pipeline (HSTDM pipeline for short) to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of the final science data to be archived for further research. This process necessitates that the HSTDM pipeline address instrumental artifacts and effects as well as the coordination of data flow of the scheduled observing sequences under all observing modes of HSTDM within the CSST automated processing environment. As the understanding of CSST HSTDM data processing develops during the pipeline development stage, it becomes essential to assess the accuracy, the robustness and the performance of the HSTDM pipeline under all observing modes of HSTDM so that components of the HSTDM pipeline be rationally added, removed, amended or extended within the modular framework. In this paper, we develop practical simulation methods to facilitate this need. The contribution of synthetic data generation of HSTDM observation includes two parts: 1. HSTDM instrumental effect simulation based on both real testing profiles and simulated models; 2. Observing data flow generation based on HSTDM observing mode scenario. The simulation methods have been implemented and shown to be practical in testing the HSTDM pipeline during the development stage.",

We have developed a compact cryogenic optical beam steering system that can be used to generate O({\\mu}s) pulses of small numbers of photons over the energy range of 1.2 - 4.5eV at room temperature, and deliver those photons via fiber optic to any specified location on the surface of a detector operating at cryogenic temperatures. This new system will allow for robust calibration of any photon-sensitive detector, including supercondcting devices. The system can be used efficiently to explore the physics of target materials, quantify the position sensitivity of different sensor designs, measure phonon transport, and study the effects of quasiparticle poisoning on detector operation. We describe the design of this pulsed calibration method and present first results obtained with a second-generation system operated at room temperature and sub-Kelvin temperatures.",

Pearce Note that there is an appendix after the references of the main manuscript Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Biomolecules (q-bio.BM) Saturnian moon Titan presents a compelling testbed for probing prebiotic chemistry beyond early Earth. Impact-generated melt pools provide transient aqueous habitats in an otherwise cryogenic environment. We use Cantera equilibrium models to assess whether mixtures of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), acetylene (C2H2), and ammonia (NH3) can drive amino acid synthesis in Selk-sized craters. Across twenty-one amino acids (twenty proteinogenic plus beta-alanine), NH3-free systems yield only proline, alanine, and beta-alanine, whereas adding as little as 1% NH3 (relative to H2O) renders almost the full suite accessible, with yields peaking at 2% and tapering thereafter. The NH3-free alanine result implies alternative pathways beyond classical Strecker or aminonitrile hydrolysis, suggesting acetylene, abundant on Titan but scarce on early Earth, as a plausible feedstock. We identify acrylonitrile (detected on Titan) as a thermodynamically favorable intermediate that can convert to alanine under aqueous conditions in an NH3-free pathway. For glycine and alanine production from nitrile hydrolysis, comparison with laboratory kinetics shows that our equilibrium models predict near-complete conversion, while observed rates yield only partial products over weeks. Yet estimated chemical equilibration times (years-centuries) are far shorter than melt lifetimes, supporting plausibility of equilibrium in situ. These predictions are directly testable with Dragonfly mass spectrometer (DraMS), for which we recommend pre-flight standards to test proline, alanine, beta-alanine, cysteine, and methionine. The first three offer the best chances for amino acid detection regardless of ammonia availability; the latter two offer diagnostic tools for determining the presence of reactive sulfur in post-impact Titan ponds.",

Training data, trained neural networks, and the python interface are publicly available. Abstract abridged for arXiv requirements Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Light scattering by dust particles is often modeled assuming the dust is spherical for numerical simplicity and speed. However, real dust particles have highly irregular morphologies that significantly affect their scattering properties. We have developed glitterin, a neural network trained to predict light scattering from irregularly shaped dust grains, offering a computationally efficient alternative to Lorenz-Mie theory. We computed scattering properties using the Discrete Dipole Approximation code ADDA for irregularly shaped particles across size parameters x from 0.1 to 65, covering a range in complex refractive index m that includes astrosilicates, pyroxene, enstatite, water-ice, etc. The neural network operates at millisecond timescales while maintaining superior accuracy compared to linear interpolation. Irregular grains exhibit x-dependent deviations from spherical predictions. At small x, cross-sections approach volume-equivalent spheres for low m. At large x, irregular grains show enhanced cross-sections due to greater geometric extension. Increasing m also enhances the absorption cross-section relative to the volume-equivalent spheres. This differential x and m dependence creates mid-IR solid-state features distinct from predictions from spherical grains. Validation against laboratory measurements of forsterite and hematite demonstrates that our neural network captures both qualitative and quantitative behaviors more accurately than spherical models. Millimeter-wavelength applications reveal that spherical grains produce opposite polarization signatures compared to irregular grains, potentially relaxing stringent ~100um grain size constraints in protoplanetary disks. glitterin is publicly available and alleviates the computational barriers to incorporating emission and scattering of realistic grain morphologies.",

      "abstract": "PEPSI Investigation, Retrieval, and Atlas of Numerous Giant Atmospheres (PIRANGA). IV. High-Resolution Phased-Resolved Spectroscopy of The Ultra Hot Jupiter KELT-20 b Victoria Bonidie, Marshall C. Johnson, Ji Wang, Sydney Petz, Jake Kamen, Calder Lenhart, Alison Duck, Carles Badenes, Klaus Strassmeier, Ilya Ilyin Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We present five datasets of high-resolution optical emission spectra of the ultra-hot Jupiter KELT-20 b with the PEPSI spectrograph. Using a Bayesian retrieval framework, we constrain its dayside pressure-temperature profile and abundances of Fe, Ni, and Ca, providing the first measurements for Ni and Ca for KELT-20 b in emission. We retrieve the pre- and post-eclipse datasets separately (corresponding to the evening and morning sides, respectively), and compare the constraints on their thermal structures and chemical abundances. We constrain lower abundances in the pre-eclipse datasets compared to the post-eclipse datasets. We interpret these results with an equilibrium chemistry model which suggests ~10-30x supersolar refractory abundances. Due to the well-known degeneracy between absolute abundances and continuum opacities, the abundance ratios are more precise probes of the planetary abundances. Therefore we measure the abundance ratios [Ni/Fe] and [Ca/Fe] across these datasets and find they agree within 1-sigma. We constrain [Ni/Fe] to be consistent with solar within 2-sigma, and [Ca/Fe] to be 0.001-0.01x solar, not accounting for ionization. We compare these abundance ratios with literature results for KELT-20 b in transmission, and find they agree within 2-sigma, suggesting that even though the abundances vary significantly as a function of phase, the abundance ratios of these species remain relatively constant. We find a ~100 K difference in temperature at the top of the thermal inversion, suggesting a hotter evening side than morning side and underscoring the importance of considering 3D effects when studying ultra-hot Jupiters.",

Independent study based on public MEDA data from NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS) processed in Python. Not peer-reviewed Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We present an analysis of atmospheric pressure variability inside Jezero Crater on Mars based on measurements from the MEDA meteorological station aboard NASA's Perseverance rover. Pressure data from Sols 182, 361, 504, and 658 reveal seasonal and diurnal fluctuations linked to solar insolation, CO2 condensation and sublimation cycles, and local geomorphology. During Sol 504, an unexpected pressure increase was recorded despite coinciding with the onset of northern winter, suggesting the influence of perihelion and dust-related thermal tides. Statistical parameters such as mean, standard deviation, and amplitude show that Jezero exhibits larger diurnal pressure swings than Gale Crater, mainly due to its lower latitude and topographic confinement. These results demonstrate the strong coupling between Martian atmospheric dynamics, orbital configuration, and local topography, and illustrate the value of MEDA data for characterizing short-term and seasonal variations in the Martian boundary layer.",

In this paper, we develop a new model to estimate the contact surface radius and the number of contact points as functions of collision velocity, and examine the formation process of comet 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko. Our model is based on the compressive strength of dust aggregates obtained from numerical simulations and assumes that all the impact energy of the pebbles is used for their mutual compression. We compare our model with numerical simulations of pebble collisions, in which we prepare the initial pebbles in the form of compressed dust aggregate spheres and measure the contact surface and pebble radii using two- and three-dimensional characteristic radii, respectively. We also apply our model to the formation scenario of comet 67P, whose tensile strength and bulk density have already been estimated in the literature. We find that its low tensile strength points to formation via pebble collisions at velocities below $\\sim10\\mathrm{\\ cm\\ s^{-1}}$ when a microscopic filling factor of pebbles is lower than 0.6, suggesting that inelastic bouncing collisions played a role in damping the collision velocities. By assuming that the pebble collision velocity is determined by the transition velocity between bouncing and sticking, we estimate the pebble radius inside comet 67P to be 130 $\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ or smaller.",

Accepted for publication in Space Science Reviews Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph) Most our knowledge about rocky exoplanets is based on their measure of mass and radius. These two parameters are routinely measured and are used to categorise different populations of observed exoplanets. They are also tightly linked to the planet's properties, in particular those of the interior. As such they offer the unique opportunity to interpret the observations and potentially infer the planet's chemistry and structure. Required for the interpretation are models of planetary interiors, calculated a priori, constrained using other available data, and based on the physiochemical properties of mineralogical phases. This article offers an overview of the current knowledge about exoplanet interiors, the fundamental aspects and tools for interior modelling and how to improve the contraints on the models, along with a discussion on the sources of uncertainty. The origin and fate of volatiles, and their role in planetary evolution is discussed. The chemistry and structure of planetary interiors have a pivotal role in the thermal evolution of planets and the development of large scale properties that might become observables with future space missions and ground-based surveys. As such, having reliable and well constrained interior models is of the utmost importance for the advancement of the field.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Context. True spin-orbit obliquities {\\Psi} offer valuable insights into the evolutionary history of exoplanetary systems. Previous studies have suggested that exoplanets tend to occupy either aligned or perpendicular orbits. However, recent research has indicated potential biases caused by the low sample, questioning whether this dichotomy would persist with a larger dataset. Simultaneously, a similar dichotomous behavior has been suggested for Neptune-sized planets. Aims. We aim to investigate the distribution of true spin-orbit obliquities {\\Psi} with an enlarged sample, looking for confirmation of the disputed dichotomy previously found, with a focus also on the obliquities of Neptunes. Methods. Starting from a sample of 264 projected obliquities {\\lambda}, we homogeneously compute true obliquities {\\Psi} for 116 planets using the rotation period method. We combine them with 4 further values gathered from literature and we then study their distribution, also as a function of various star-planet system parameters. Results. Our data-driven work based on 120 true obliquities {\\Psi} - the largest sample to date - strongly confirms the presence of a single cluster of aligned planets, followed by an isotropic distribution of misaligned planets with no preferred misalignment. This result is based on a uniform distribution of stellar inclinations {i_\\star} , for which non-uniformity could have biased previous interpretations of the arrangement of true obliquities. We confirm that Neptunians show a tentative dichotomous distribution with data available today, but its veracity needs confirmation with an enlarged sample, also because an anisotropic distribution of stellar inclination may be one of the factors hindering the real distribution.",

Submitted to Physical Review Letters Space Physics (physics.space-ph); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) Despite heat flux's role in regulating energy conversion in collisionless plasmas, its properties and evolution in the magnetosheath downstream of the Earth's bow shock are scarcely explored. We use MMS in situ measurements to quantify and characterize the electron heat flux in the magnetosheath. We find that the heat flux is shaped by the magnetosheath magnetic field as it drapes around the magnetosphere. While it is affected by solar wind upstream conditions and increases with magnetic field strength, it is not substantially changed by local magnetosheath processes. Also, the heat flux is limited by whistler instability thresholds.",

      "abstract": "Adsorption of volatiles on dust grains in protoplanetary disks Lile Wang, Feng Long, Haifeng Yang, Ruobing Dong, Shenzhen Xu 15 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ApJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The adsorption of volatile molecules onto dust grain surfaces fundamentally influences dust-related processes, including condensation of gas-phase molecules, dust coagulation, and planet formation in protoplanetary disks. Using advanced ab-initio density functional theory with r$^2$SCAN+rVV10 van der Waals functionals, we calculate adsorption energies of H$_2$, H$_2$O, and CO on carbonaceous (graphene, amorphous carbon) and silicate (MgSiO$_3$) surfaces. Results reveal fundamentally different adsorption mechanisms: weak physisorption on carbonaceous surfaces ($|\\Delta\\epsilon_{\\rm ad}|\\sim 0.1-0.2~{\\rm eV}$) versus strong chemisorption on silicates ($|\\Delta\\epsilon_{\\rm ad}|\\sim 0.5-1.5~{\\rm eV}$) via coordination bonds. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations incorporating these energies demonstrate divergent surface evolution: carbonaceous grains exhibit distinct condensation radius compared to silicates, while the cocrystal of H$_2$O and CO significantly increases the desorption temperature of CO. The actual radii of gas-phase molecule depletion could thus be a comprehensive result of temperatures, chemical compositions, and even evolution tracks. Meanwhile, silicates maintain chemisorbed molecular coatings throughout most disk regions. Such dichotomy in surface coverage could also provide a natural mechanism for carbon depletion in inner planetary systems.",
