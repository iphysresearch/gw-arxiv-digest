      "abstract": "Short GRB 090510: a magnetized neutron star binary merger leading to a black hole J. A. Rueda, R. Ruffini, Yu Wang Accepted for publication in the Journal of High Energy Astrophysics (JHEAP) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We model the short gamma-ray bursts (GRB) 090510 as the product of a magnetized neutron star (NS) binary merger. Accounting for the NS critical mass constraint given by the mass of PSR J0952--0607, we infer that GRB 090510 was a highly-magnetized NS-NS merger that left as remnant a Kerr black hole (BH) of $2.4 M_\\odot$ with a low-mass accretion disk. The gamma-ray precursor is powered by the magnetic energy released during the merger of the NSs. The prompt emission originates at the transparency of an ultra-relativistic $e^+e^-$ pair-plasma produced by the overcritical electric field induced by the rotating strong magnetic field around the merged object before it reaches the critical mass, the GeV emission by the extractable energy of the newborn BH, and the X-ray afterglow by accretion onto it. We derive the masses of the merging NSs, their magnetic fields, the BH mass, spin, and irreducible mass, the strength of the magnetic field, the disk mass, and obtain an estimate of the gravitational-wave emission during the merger phase preceding the prompt short GRB emission. The inferred parameters agree with up-to-date numerical relativity simulations, confirming that strong magnetic fields above $10^{14}$ G develop in NS-NS mergers and that mergers leading to a central BH remnant have low-mass disks of $\\sim 10^{-2} M_\\odot$. We also advance the possibility that quasi-period oscillations of tens of Hz of frequency due to Lense-Thirring precession of the matter surrounding the merged object before BH formation can explain the successive spikes following the prompt emission peak.",

Here, we investigate how the probabilities of observing our values of these constants depend on the assumptions made about the theories governing particle physics and cosmology, along with habitability. The particle physics effects we consider include constraints on the Higgs vacuum expectation value from big bang nucleosynthesis and supernovae, grand unified theories (GUTs), and standard model stability. Cosmology effects we consider are different theories of dark matter and baryogenesis, and for galactic habitability effects we include star formation efficiency, stellar encounters, supernova explosions, and active galactic nuclei. We find the following to be disfavored in the multiverse scenario: flexible GUTs, pessimistic galactic disruption rates, some origin of life theories, and freeze-out dark matter with high energy baryogenesis. These predictions can be tested in future experiments to either confirm or rule out the multiverse.",

Comments are welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) This investigation examines QPOs in two quantum-corrected BH spacetimes that preserve general covariance while incorporating quantum gravitational effects through a dimensionless parameter \\zeta. We combine analytical derivations of epicyclic frequencies with comprehensive numerical simulations of BHL accretion to explore how quantum corrections manifest in observable astrophysical phenomena. Using a fiducial BH mass of M=10M_\\odot representative of stellar-mass X-ray binaries, we demonstrate that the two models exhibit fundamentally different behaviors: Model-I modifies both temporal and radial metric components, leading to innermost stable circular orbit migration proportional to \\zeta^4 and dramatic stagnation point evolution from 27M to 5M as quantum corrections strengthen. Model-II preserves the classical temporal component while altering only spatial geometry, maintaining constant stagnation points and stable cavity structures throughout the parameter range. Our numerical simulations reveal distinct QPO generation mechanisms, with Model-I showing systematic frequency evolution and cavity shrinkage that suppresses oscillations for \\zeta \\geq 3M, while Model-II maintains stable low-frequency modes up to \\zeta \\geq 5M. Power spectral density analyzes demonstrate characteristic frequency ratios (3:2, 2:1, 5:3) consistent with observations from X-ray binaries, providing specific targets for discriminating between quantum correction scenarios. The hydrodynamically derived constraints (\\zeta \\lesssim 4M) show remarkable agreement with independent EHT limits for M87* and Sgr A*, validating our theoretical framework through multiple observational channels. These results establish QPO frequency analysis as a probe for detecting quantum gravitational effects in astrophysical BHs and demonstrate the complementary nature of timing and imaging observations in constraining fundamental physics.",

Richardson Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In the last decade, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the European Virgo observatory have opened a new observational window on the universe. These cavity-enhanced laser interferometers sense spacetime strain, generated by distant astrophysical events such as black hole mergers, to an RMS fluctuation of a few parts in $10^{21}$ over a multi-kilometer baseline. Optical advancements in laser wavefront control are key to advancing the sensitivity of current detectors and enabling a planned next-generation 40-km gravitational wave observatory in the United States, known as Cosmic Explorer. We report the first experimental demonstration of a new wavefront control technique for gravitational-wave detection, obtained from testing a full-scale prototype on a 40-kg LIGO mirror. Our results indicate that this design can meet the unique and challenging requirements of providing higher-order precision wavefront corrections at megawatt laser power levels, while introducing extremely low effective displacement noise into the interferometer. This new technology will have a direct and enabling impact on the observational science, expanding the gravitational-wave detection horizon to very early times in the universe, before the first stars formed, and enabling new tests of gravity, cosmology, and dense nuclear matter.",

This method, which we call Star Log-extended eMulation (SLM), utilizes the underlying logarithmic behavior of the differential equations to enable accurate emulation of the nonlinear system. We show predictions for well-known equations of state (EOSs) with fixed parameters using the SLM, accurately recreating high-fidelity results while achieving a computational speed-up of $\\approx 2.4 \\times 10^4$. We test our parametric SLM method for a two-parameter quarkyonic EOS against high-fidelity RK4 TOV calculations and find a computational speedup of $\\approx 7.0 \\times 10^4$. Hence, SLM is an efficient emulator for the numerous TOV evaluations required by multi-messenger astrophysical frameworks that infer constraints on the EOS. The ability of the SLM algorithm to learn a mapping between parameters of the EOS and subsequent neutron star properties also opens up potential extensions for assisting in computationally prohibitive uncertainty quantification (UQ) for any type of EOS.

It is particularly sensitive to detecting small-scale structures and early heating processes. Despite the rich information contained in the 21-cm forest signal, the complexity of directly modeling the signal has led to a lack of effective analytical models. However, the one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum of the 21-cm forest contains valuable information about the matter power spectrum, making analytical modeling feasible. This work employs an analytical modeling approach based on the halo model, which links the distribution of matter to dark matter halos, allowing for effective predictions of cosmic structure formation and its impact on the 21-cm signal. By considering various parameter scenarios within the halo model framework, particularly different dark matter particle masses and varying levels of cosmic heating, we can capture the complexities of small-scale structures and make the 1D power spectrum modeling applicable across a wide range of parameters. This method not only enhances our understanding of the 21-cm forest signal but also provides theoretical support for future observational data. Observing the 21-cm forest with large radio telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array, is anticipated to enable simultaneous exploration of dark matter properties and the heating history of the early universe.",

Different candidates-including axions, dark photons, macroscopic dark matter, WIMPs, and dark-matter spikes-may appear in interferometer data via their coupling to gravity or the Standard Model, altering the measured gravitational-wave strain in distinct ways. Despite their differences, these candidates share two key features: (1) they can be probed through their effects on gravitational waves from inspiraling compact objects, isolated black holes, and neutron stars, or via direct interactions with detectors, and (2) their signatures likely persist far longer than the seconds-long mergers detected today, necessitating new data analysis methods beyond matched filtering.

We explore how complexity correlates not only with macroscopic observables such as mass and radius, but also with the microscopic characteristics of the underlying equation of state. By incorporating both realistic equations of state and analytical solutions to Einstein's field equations, we demonstrate that gravitational mass plays a dominant role in determining the behavior of complexity. Furthermore, we show that strong phase transitions within the stellar interior, such as those hypothesized in hybrid stars, can manifest as distinct features in the complexity profile, offering a potential informational signature of such transitions. This work offers new insights into the link between information theory and compact object physics, highlighting complexity's potential as a diagnostic tool in astrophysics.",

Danielle Leonard, Markus Michael Rau, Cora Uhlemann, Shahab Joudaki 25 pages, 10 figures, comments welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Stage IV cosmological surveys will map the universe with unprecedented precision, reducing statistical uncertainties to levels where unmodelled systematics can significantly bias inference. In particular, photometric redshift (photo-z) errors and intrinsic alignments (IA) must be robustly accounted for to ensure accurate inference of cosmological parameters. The increasing depth of Stage IV surveys exacerbates these challenges by producing low signal-to-noise galaxy populations prone to inaccurate photo-z measurements. Catastrophically misidentified redshifts are especially problematic for 3$\\times$2pt inferences that combine weak lensing and galaxy clustering information. We demonstrate that even modest outlier fractions (e.g. 5%) can lead to substantial biases in cosmological parameter estimates: up to 1.8${\\sigma}$ in ${\\Omega}_M$ and ${\\sigma}_8$, and over 8${\\sigma}$ in the IA redshift evolution parameter ${\\eta}$. To address this, we introduce a flexible weighting scheme at the likelihood level that down-weights the most contamination-sensitive elements of the data vector during inference. This method mitigates biases without inflating the parameter space, reducing cosmological parameter biases to below 1${\\sigma}$ without substantially degrading constraining power. Our approach offers a practical solution for future analyses, enabling robust cosmological inference in the presence of catastrophic redshift errors.",

Despite their relevance, relativistic imprints in the distribution of galaxies on large scales have so far eluded detection, mainly because they are stronger on the largest cosmic scales, which are plagued by cosmic variance. Expanding on previous works, we study galaxy clustering by subdividing a galaxy population into two sub-samples -- bright and faint -- and we here focus on their two-point correlation function in harmonic space, i.e. via the angular power spectrum. Thanks to such a split in magnitude and by exploiting the multi-tracer technique, we are able to boost the impact of the relativistic contributions. We first focus on the leading relativistic contribution given by the Doppler effect and show that, with a carefully tailored luminosity cut, it can be detected. Then, we look at the sub-dominant effects predicted by general relativity and quantify how their statistical significance, as yet undetectable, varies with redshift binning and survey specifications. As case studies, we consider in our forecasts a bright galaxy sample at low redshift, an H$\\alpha$ emission-line galaxy survey at intermediate redshifts, and high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies at high redshift.",

Zou 42 pages, 10 figures, comments are welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We assess the impact of the fiducial cosmology choice on cosmological inference from full-shape (FS) fits of the galaxy power spectrum in the DESI 2024 Data Release 1 (DR1). Using a suite of AbacusSummit DR1 mock catalogues based on the Planck 2018 best-fit cosmology, we quantify potential systematic shifts introduced by analysing the data under five secondary cosmologies - featuring variations in matter density, thawing dark energy, higher effective number of neutrino species, reduced clustering amplitude, and the DESI DR1 BAO best-fit $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology - relative to DESI's baseline Planck 2018 cosmology. We investigate two complementary FS analysis approaches: full-modelling (FM) and ShapeFit (SF), each with distinct sensitivities to the assumed fiducial model. Across all tracers, we find for FM that systematic shifts induced by fiducial cosmology mismatches remain well below the DESI DR1 statistical uncertainties, with maximum deviations of 0.22$\\sigma_\\mathrm{DR1}$ in $\\Lambda$CDM scenarios and 0.12$\\sigma_\\mathrm{DR1+SN}$ when including SN Ia mock data in extended $w_0w_a$CDM fits. For SF, the shifts in the compressed parameters remain below $0.45\\sigma_\\mathrm{DR1}$ for all tracers and cosmologies.",

Submitted to MNRAS Letters Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Radio halos are diffuse synchrotron sources that trace the turbulent intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters. However, their origin remains unknown. Two main formation models have been proposed: the hadronic model, in which relativistic electrons are continuously injected by cosmic-ray protons; and the leptonic turbulent re-acceleration model, where cluster mergers re-energise electrons in situ. A key discriminant between the two models would be the existence of ultra-steep spectrum radio halos (USSRHs), which can only be produced through turbulent re-acceleration. Here we report the discovery of an USSRH in the galaxy cluster SPT-CLJ2337$-$5942 at redshift $z = 0.78$ in the MeerKAT-South Pole Telescope 100 deg$^2$ survey. This discovery is noteworthy for two primary reasons: it is the highest redshift USSRH system to date; and the close correspondence of the radio emission with the thermal ICM as traced by $\\mathit{Chandra}$ X-ray observations, further supporting the leptonic re-acceleration model. The halo is under-luminous for its mass, consistent with a minor merger origin, which produces steep-spectrum, lower luminosity halos. This result demonstrates the power of wide-field, high-fidelity, $\\lesssim1$ GHz surveys like the MeerKAT-SPT 100 deg$^2$ programme to probe the origin and evolution of radio halos over cosmic time, ahead of the Square Kilometre Array.",

Constraints from the Giant Arc in Abell 370 Lana Eid, Charles R. Keeton The Astrophysical Journal, 990:196 (19pp), 2025 September 10 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We aim to improve cluster lens modeling and source reconstruction by utilizing the full information in giant, caustic-crossing arcs lensed by galaxy clusters. Lens models are generally constrained using image positions and assuming point sources, but spatially extended giant arcs provide more constraints; however, they require a more complex model that accounts for the structure of the extended source. We seek to determine whether improvements to the lens model and reconstructed source merit the difficulty of handling the extra constraints. We choose the spatially extended $z=0.725$ giant arc in the $z=0.375$ Abell 370 galaxy cluster field for our study. We present 1) a series of pixel-based source reconstructions for cluster mass models exploring the range of uncertainties in our fiducial model, 2) a similar analysis done using a prototype \\textit{python} de-lensing code for cluster mass models from each of the Hubble Frontier Fields modeling teams, 3) an optimized model with pixel-based source reconstructions, and 4) and an investigation of how our optimized model affects the cluster mass model locally and globally in the highest-magnification regions. We find that our optimized model 1) is able to correct resolution-limited assumptions in cluster model inputs local to the arc, 2) has significantly smaller arc model residuals than results from the standard Hubble Frontier Fields models, and 3) affects the critical curves and therefore the information derived from highest-magnification zones most significantly in regions local to the arc.",

In addition to the well-understood oscillations arising from the Ly$\\alpha$--Si-III cross correlation, we find an enhancement in small-scale power that has been ignored in previous studies. We therefore develop a new analytical fitting function that captures two critical effects that have previously been neglected: distinct Ly$\\alpha$ and Si-III line profiles, and a variable ratio for coeval Ly$\\alpha$ and Si-III optical depths. In contrast to earlier work, we also predict amplitudes for the Si-III power spectrum and Ly$\\alpha$--Si-III cross power spectrum that decrease toward lower redshift due to the hardening metagalactic UV background spectrum at $z\\lesssim 3.5$. The fitting function is validated by comparison against multiple simulated datasets at redshifts $2.2\\leq z \\leq 5.0$ and wavenumbers $k < 0.2\\rm\\,s\\,km^{-1}$. Our model remains in good agreement with earlier work at large scales ($k \\lesssim 0.06\\rm\\,s\\,km^{-1}$) and it has little effect on existing warm dark matter constraints from the Ly$\\alpha$ forest when adopting a physically motivated prior on the silicon abundance.

Fabbian 4 pages, 4 figures, submitted to A&A letters Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Comparison between cosmological studies is usually performed in a statistical manner at the level of the posteriors of cosmological parameters. In this Letter, we show how this approach poorly reflects the differences between cosmological analyses, when applied to cosmological studies using galaxy cluster abundances. We illustrate this by deriving the implications of the best-fit cosmologies from the recent SPT and eROSITA cluster number counts analyses on the Planck thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (t-SZ) probes. We first fix the mass calibration, and find that the Planck cluster sample would theoretically contain 498 clusters with the SPT cosmology, and 1098 clusters with the eROSITA cosmology, instead of the 439 clusters observed. We then fit the Planck number counts to both cosmologies, only varying the hydrostatic mass bias, and find required biases of $0.790 \\pm 0.070$ and $0.630 \\pm 0.034$ for SPT and eROSITA respectively, instead of the $0.844^{+0.055}_{-0.062}$ derived in Aymerich et al. (2025). Lastly, we compute the expected t-SZ power spectrum obtained from the SPT and eROSITA cosmologies, and compare these to the Planck measurement. While the predicted SPT angular power spectrum is in good agreement with the Planck measurements, the normalisation of the predicted eROSITA angular power spectrum is two times higher at all scales. These two tests highlight the power of comparing predicted cluster abundances and t-SZ power spectra to measured data in a physically interpretable way.",

Within the effective field theory (EFT) framework, we show that the parity-odd IA power spectrum is sensitive to the collapsed limit of the parity-odd primordial trispectrum. For a $U(1)$-gauge inflationary model, the IA power spectrum is proportional to the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation, $P_\\zeta(k) \\propto k^{-3}$. However, the proportionality constants contain not only the PNG amplitude but also undetermined EFT bias parameters. We use $N$-body simulations to determine the bias parameters for dark matter halos. Using these bias parameters, we forecast IA's constraining power, assuming data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We find that the IA power spectrum can improve the current limits on the amplitude of parity-violating PNG derived from galaxy four-point correlation and CMB trispectrum analyses. Moreover, galaxy shapes are complementary to these probes as they are sensitive to different scales and trispectrum configurations. Beyond galaxy shapes, we develop a new method to generate initial conditions for simulations and forward models from the parity-odd trispectrum with an enhanced collapsed limit.",

We analyzed the deep and well-characterized sample of groups detected with AMICO in the COSMOS(-Web) field. Our study of the quiescent galaxy population is based on a machine-learning classification tool based on rest-frame magnitudes. The algorithm learns from several traditional methods to estimate the probability of a galaxy being quiescent, achieving high precision and recall. Starting from this classification, we computed quiescent galaxy fractions within groups via two methods: one based on the membership probabilities provided by AMICO, which rely on an analytical model, and another using a model-independent technique. We then detected the RS by estimating the ridgeline position using photometric data, followed by sigma clipping to remove outliers. This analysis was performed using both rest-frame and observed-frame magnitudes with rest-frame matching. We compared the results from both approaches and investigated the $z$ and richness dependence of the RS parameters. We found that the quiescent galaxy population in groups builds up steadily from z=1.5-2 across all richnesses, with faster and earlier growth in the richest groups. The first galaxies settle onto the RS ridgeline by $z \\sim 2$, consistent with current evolutionary scenarios. Notably, we reported a rare overdensity of quiescent galaxies at z=3.4, potentially one of the most distant early RSs observed. Extending our study to X-rays, we found that X-ray faint groups have, on average, lower quiescent fractions than X-ray bright ones, likely reflecting their typical location in filaments. Leveraging the broad wavelength coverage of COSMOS2025, we traced RS evolution over $\\sim 12$ Gyr, finding no significant trends in either slope or scatter of the ridgeline.",

Due to the limited sample size of galaxies with dynamically inferred SMBH masses, more readily measurable galaxy properties $X$ that correlate with the black hole mass are used as labels (via scaling relations $M_{\\bullet}-X$), which can then be counted in a larger galaxy catalog to produce a measurement of the mass function. Estimating the amplitude of the GWB from the local mass function is therefore simpler than general measurements of scaling relations and galaxy mass/luminosity functions for two reasons: the contribution to the characteristic strain is dominated by a narrow range of masses, and the mass proxy $X$ is always marginalized over. While consistent errors in $X$ in both catalogs are irrelevant, relatively small biases between them can produce significant shifts in the predicted SMBH abundance. In this work, we explore measurements of the SMBH mass function using different mass proxies through a set of catalogs with a number of redundant measurements between them. This enables us to investigate internal inconsistencies that lead to discrepancies in the final black hole abundance, while minimizing observational systematic biases induced by combining disparate sets of measurements. We focus on 3 proxies: the velocity dispersion $\\sigma$, K-band luminosity $L$, and a combination of $L$ and radius $R$ defined by the fundamental plane.

Mukhin High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We report new constraints on the velocity-independent annihilation cross section $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle$ of keV-scale dark matter particles based on 11 years of observations with the NuSTAR X-ray telescope. Using the unfocused stray light mode of the instrument, which provides a wide field-of-view and a stable instrumental background, we perform a sensitive search for photon signatures from dark matter annihilation in the Galactic halo. We model the resulting diffuse X-ray spectrum over the 3-20 keV energy range and search for line-like spectral features that may arise from the annihilation of dark matter particles into photons. No statistically significant excess over the expected astrophysical background is found. We therefore place upper limits on $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle$ as a function of dark matter mass, assuming a velocity-independent s-wave annihilation and several Galactic dark matter profiles. Across most of the explored mass range our results provide the strongest X-ray constraints to date, reaching the level of $\\langle\\sigma v\\rangle \\lesssim 10^{-33}$ -- $10^{-34}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$, and they are complementary to the most recent bounds derived from SRG/ART-XC observations.",

This manuscript represents the original submitted version following journal policy. Comments are welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The existence of abundant post-starburst/quiescent galaxies just $\\sim$1-2 Gyrs after the Big Bang challenges our current paradigm of galaxy evolution. Cosmological simulations suggest that quasar feedback is likely the most promising mechanism responsible for such rapid quenching. Here we report a high detection rate (6/27) of exceptionally fast and powerful galaxy-scale outflows traced by [O III] emission in z $\\sim$ 5-6 luminous quasars as revealed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with velocity up to $\\sim$8400 km s$^{-1}$ and order-of-magnitude kinetic energy outflow rates up to $\\sim$260% the observed quasar bolometric luminosities. This fraction is $\\gtrsim$6.6 times larger than that in luminosity-matched comparison samples at z $\\sim$ 1.5-3.5 (0/58) and z $<$ 1 (5/148). These extreme outflows are comparable to or even faster than the most rapid [O III] outflows reported at z $\\lesssim$ 3, and could reach the circumgalactic medium (CGM) or even the intergalactic medium (IGM). The average kinetic energy outflow rate of our entire sample is $\\sim$230$\\times$ higher than that at cosmic noon. The substantially higher frequency of outflows with energetics well above the threshold for negative feedback in our sample strongly suggests that quasar feedback plays a significant role in efficiently quenching/regulating early massive galaxies.",

Rev. D Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) The gravitational wave (GW) interferometers LISA and ET are expected to be functional in the next decade(s), possibly around the same time. They will operate over different frequency ranges, with similar integrated sensitivities to the amplitude of a stochastic GW background (SGWB). We investigate the synergies between these two detectors, in terms of a multi-band detection of a cosmological SGWB characterised by a large amplitude, and a broad frequency spectrum. We develop the notion of integrated sensitivity and propose a novel signal-to-noise (SNR) optimal for characterization of the geometrical properties of the interferometer systems of LISA and ET operating simultaneously. By investigating various examples of SGWBs, such as those arising from cosmological phase transition, cosmic string, primordial inflation, we show that LISA and ET operating together will have the opportunity to assess more effectively the characteristics of the GW spectrum produced by the same cosmological source, but at separate frequency scales. Moreover, the two experiments in tandem can be sensitive to features of early universe cosmic expansion before big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), which affects the SGWB frequency profile, and which would not be possible to detect otherwise, since two different frequency ranges correspond to two different pre-BBN (or post-inflationary) epochs. Besides considering the GW spectrum, we additionally undertake a preliminary study of the sensitivity of LISA and ET to soft limits of higher order tensor correlation functions. Given that these experiments operate at different frequency bands, their synergy constitutes an ideal direct probe of squeezed limits of higher order GW correlators, which can not be measured operating with a single instrument only.",

Various well-motivated models predict that the universe could have undergone a period of matter domination in this early epoch. We demonstrate that if the particles causing matter domination have self-interactions, they can form halos that undergo a gravothermal collapse. We thus propose a novel scenario for the formation of primordial black holes, which in particular can lie within the asteroid-mass range. We also find that it is not only black holes that can form in the aftermath of a gravothermal evolution. We show that number-changing annihilations of the particles can create sufficient heat to halt the gravothermal evolution, thus forming a ``cannibal star''. Likewise, the pressure from the particle's repulsive self-interactions can form a boson star during a gravothermal evolution. Thus, our study highlights that structure formation in the early universe can have a rich phenomenology.",

      "abstract": "Influence of photometric galaxies redshift distribution in BAO estimation Paula S. Ferreira, Ribamar R. R. Reis Update to a complete description chi-squared test including cross-bin terms Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Photometric surveys are good solutions for large-scale structure studies. The Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) benefit from photometric redshift survey observations due to faster coverage and a higher number of observed objects. In the present study, we use the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 catalog of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG) to incorporate the realistic galaxies' redshift Probability Distribution Function (PDF) into the correlation function cosmological model. We used four different photo-z estimators \\texttt{ANNz2}, \\texttt{BPZ}, \\texttt{ENF}, and \\texttt{DNF} to compare how they affect the BAO feature constraint, the catalogs called \\texttt{Pz Cats}. Moreover, each algorithm included two sample selections based on distinct PDF shapes; one where the PDFs are nearly Gaussian and another opting for the least noisy PDFs with a pronounced peak. Our investigation identifies whether our samples detect BAO using the correlation function's polynomial parameterization. Later, we computed the correlation function $\\xi_\\perp(z_p)$ by getting the bin pairs transversal to each other using \\texttt{CAMB}. The kernel window function is the $f(z|z_p)$ which is the selection of the PDF value when the photometric redshift is nearly the same as the spectroscopic redshift estimated by the matched spectroscopic sample. For compatible $z_{\\rm eff}$, we concluded that the shape of the galaxy redshift PDF could shift the BAO feature position either by including the PDF in the model or not. We also learnt that, given the same spectroscopic sample, \\texttt{ANNz2} estimator with its respective selection samples outperforms other estimators for most parameters examined.",

Notably, FS+BBN can constrain the interaction for the 10 eV mediator independently of CMB data, yielding $g_\\nu < 7.33 \\times 10^{-12}$ at $95\\%$ confidence.

However, these analyses have generally neglected the tidal influence of the Milky Way, which can substantially suppress the FDM-induced heating effect in satellites. This oversight arises from computational challenges of accurately capturing the tidal effects in FDM simulations. In this study, we present a novel simulation framework that, for the first time, enables the simulation of an FDM-stellar system within an observationally motivated gravitational potential of the Milky Way. This framework incorporates the diverse Galactic components, including the gravitational influence of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Using the Fornax dwarf galaxy as a case study, we demonstrate that tidal effects significantly alleviate the tension between observational data and the predicted heating effect for an FDM particle mass of $m_a\\sim 10^{-22}$ eV.",

In this work, we present a forecast based on the Fisher matrix method to establish its sensitivity to the sum of the neutrino masses. We adapt the Fisher Galaxy Survey Code (FARO) to account for the neutrino mass under various configurations applied to galaxy clustering measurements. This approach allows us to test the sensitivity of J-PAS to the neutrino mass across different tracers, with and without non-linear corrections, and under varying sky coverage. We perform our forecast for two cosmological models: $\\Lambda CDM + \\sum m_\\nu$ and $w_0w_a CDM + \\sum m_\\nu$. We combine our J-PAS forecast with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from the Planck Collaboration and Type Ia supernova (SN) data from Pantheon Plus. Our analysis shows that, for a sky coverage of 8,500 square degrees, J-PAS galaxy clustering data alone will constrain the sum of the neutrino masses to an upper limit at 95\\% C.L of $\\sum m_\\nu < 0.32$ eV for the $\\Lambda CDM + \\sum m_\\nu$ model, and $\\sum m_\\nu < 0.36$ eV for the $w_0w_a CDM + \\sum m_\\nu$ model. When combined with Planck data, the upper limit improves significantly. For J-PAS+Planck at 95\\% C.L, we find $\\sum m_\\nu < 0.061$ eV for the $\\Lambda CDM + \\sum m_\\nu$ model, and for J-PAS+Planck+Pantheon Plus, we obtain $\\sum m_\\nu < 0.12$ eV for the $w_0w_a CDM + \\sum m_\\nu$ model. These results demonstrate that J-PAS clustering measurements can play a crucial role in addressing challenges in the neutrino sector, including potential tensions between cosmological and terrestrial measurements of the neutrino mass, as well as in determining the mass ordering.",

In such mixed dark matter (MDM) scenarios, even a subdominant warm component can introduce distinctive signatures via its free-streaming effects, altering the evolution of density and velocity perturbations. We present linear-order solutions for both total and relative perturbations in the two-fluid system, identifying novel contributions to galaxy bias caused by the relative density and velocity modes between the components. Incorporating these effects into the galaxy bias expansion, we compute the linear galaxy power spectrum in both real and redshift space. Using Fisher matrix forecasts, we assess the sensitivity of upcoming surveys such as DESI and PFS to MDM scenarios. Our results demonstrate that neglecting relative perturbations can lead to significant biases in inferred constraints on the warm dark matter fraction, particularly for lighter WDM masses ($\\lesssim 150~\\mathrm{eV}$ and $\\lesssim 80~\\mathrm{eV}$) for PFS and DESI, respectively. This framework provides a consistent and generalizable approach for incorporating multi-component dark matter dynamics into galaxy clustering analyses.",

Vikram Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) As photometric surveys reach unprecedented statistical precision, systematic uncertainties increasingly dominate large-scale structure probes relying on galaxy number density. Defining the final survey footprint is critical, as it excludes regions affected by artefacts or suboptimal observing conditions. For galaxy clustering, spatially varying observational systematics, such as seeing, are a leading source of bias. Template maps of contaminants are used to derive spatially dependent corrections, but extreme values may fall outside the applicability range of mitigation methods, compromising correction reliability. The complexity and accuracy of systematics modelling depend on footprint conservativeness, with aggressive masking enabling simpler, robust mitigation. We present a unified approach to define the DES Year 6 joint footprint, integrating observational systematics templates and artefact indicators that degrade mitigation performance. This removes extreme values from an initial seed footprint, leading to the final joint footprint. By evaluating the DES Year 6 lens sample MagLim++ plus plus on this footprint, we enhance the Iterative Systematics Decontamination (ISD) method, detecting non-linear systematic contamination and improving correction accuracy. While the mask's impact on clustering is less significant than systematics decontamination, it remains non-negligible, comparable to statistical uncertainties in certain w(theta) scales and redshift bins. Supporting coherent analyses of galaxy clustering and cosmic shear, the final footprint spans 4031.04 deg2, setting the basis for DES Year 6 1x2pt, 2x2pt, and 3x2pt analyses. This work highlights how targeted masking strategies optimise the balance between statistical power and systematic control in Stage-III and -IV surveys.",

Observations of galaxies at redshift $z > 6$ show peculiarly higher [OIII]$_{88\\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\\mu m}$ luminosity ratios compared to local sources. No model has so far successfully managed to match the observed emission from both [OIII]$_{88\\mu m}$ and [CII]$_{158\\mu m}$ as well as their ratio. We use Cloudy to model the [CII]$_{158\\mu m}$, [OIII]$_{88\\mu m}$, [NII]$_{122\\mu m}$ and [NIII]$_{57\\mu m}$ emission lines of Ponos: a high-resolution ($m_{\\mathrm{gas}} = 883.4\\, M_{\\odot}$) cosmological zoom-in simulation of a galaxy at redshift $z = 6.5$, which is post-processed using kramses-rt. We modify Carbon, Nitrogen and Oxygen abundances in our Cloudy models to obtain C/O and N/O abundance ratios respectively lower and higher than Solar, more in line with recent high-z observational constraints. We find [OIII]$_{88\\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\\mu m}$ luminosity ratios that are a factor of $\\sim 5$ higher compared to models assuming solar abundances. Additionally, we find an overall better agreement of the simulation with high-z observational constraints of the [CII]$_{158\\mu m}$-SFR and [OIII]$_{88\\mu m}$-SFR relations. This shows that a lower C/O abundance ratio is essential to reproduce the enhanced [OIII]$_{88\\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\\mu m}$ luminosity ratios observed at $z > 6$. By assuming a super-solar N/O ratio, motivated by recent $z > 6$ JWST observations, our models yield an [OIII]$_{88\\mu m}$/[NII]$_{122\\mu m}$ ratio of $1.3$, which, according to current theoretical models, would be more appropriate for a galaxy with a lower ionisation parameter than the one we estimated for Ponos.",

However, the advent of light curve observations adds a great amount of complexity to the problem. Our goal is to use the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to create a catalog of QSOs. We process the ZTF DR20 light curves with a transformer artificial neural network and combine different surveys with extreme gradient boosting. Based on ZTF g-band and WISE observations, we find 4,849,574 objects classified as QSOs with confidence higher than 90%. We robustly classify objects fainter than the $5\\sigma$ SNR limit at $g=20.8$ by requiring $g < n_\\mathrm{obs} / 80 + 20.375$. For 33% of QZO objects, with available WISE data, we publish redshifts with estimated error $\\Delta z/(1 + z) = 0.14$. We find that ZTF classification is superior to the Pan-STARRS static bands, and on par with WISE and Gaia measurements, but the light curves provide the most important features for QSO classification in the ZTF dataset. Using ZTF g-band data with at least 100 observational epochs per light curve, we obtain 97% F1 score for QSOs. We find that with 3 day median cadence, a survey time span of at least 900 days is required to achieve 90% QSO F1 score. However, one can obtain the same score with a survey time span of 1800 days and the median cadence prolonged to 12 days.",

Comments welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Gravitational waves (GWs) from coalescing binary black holes (BBHs) can come from different environments. GWs interact gravitationally with astrophysical objects, which makes it possible to use gravitational lensing by objects in the same gravitational system (self-lensing) to learn about their environments. We quantify the probability of self-lensing through the optical depth $\\tau$ for the main channels of detectable GWs at frequencies $f_{\\rm GW}\\sim (1-10^3)\\,{\\rm Hz}$. We then analyze the detectability of the lensing effect (imprint). In star clusters, the probability of self-lensing by stellar-mass black holes (BHs) is low, $\\tau\\simeq10^{-7}$, even when taking into account nearby BHs in resonant interactions, $\\tau\\simeq 10^{-5}$. Additionally, the lensing imprint of a stellar-mass lens (diffraction and interference) is too marginal to be detectable by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors and most Einstein Telescope signals. For a massive BH lens in the center of a cluster, the probability can reach $\\tau\\simeq 10^{-4}$ either via von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai induced mergers of BBHs orbiting a central massive BH, or BBHs formed as GW captures in single-single interactions in the Bahcall-Wolf cusp of a nuclear cluster. For self-lensing by a supermassive BH for BBHs in the migration trap of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk, $\\tau \\simeq 10^{-2}$. The imprint of these massive lenses are multiple images that are already detectable. Moreover, self-lensed signals from AGN disks have a distinct linear polarization. The probability depends on the extent of the detectability through the threshold impact parameter $y_{\\rm max}$, which can increase for future detectors. We conclude that constraining the environment of BBHs is possible by combining self-lensing imprints with other waveform signatures such as eccentricity and polarization.",

Hipólito-Ricaldi High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients of extragalactic origin, exhibiting a wide range of physical and observational properties. Distinguishing between repeating and non-repeating FRBs remains a key challenge in understanding their nature. In this work, we apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to classify FRBs based on both primary observables from the CHIME catalog and physically motivated derived features. We evaluate three hybrid pipelines combining dimensionality reduction with clustering: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) + k-means, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) + Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN), and t-SNE + Spectral Clustering. To identify optimal hyperparameters, we implement a comprehensive grid search using a custom scoring function that prioritizes recall while penalizing excessive cluster fragmentation and noise. Feature relevance is assessed using principal component loadings, mutual information with the known repeater label, and permutation-based F\\textsubscript{2} score sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that the derived features, including redshift, luminosity, and spectral properties, such as the spectral index and the spectral running, significantly enhance the classification performance. Finally, we identify a set of FRBs currently labeled as non-repeaters that consistently cluster with known repeaters across all methods, highlighting promising candidates for future follow-up observations and reinforcing the utility of unsupervised approaches in FRB population studies.",

Using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the role of massive PBHs ($m_{BH} \\sim 10^6 M_\\odot$) in catalyzing the formation of direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs), providing a natural in situ pathway for binary SMBH formation. PBHs enhance local overdensities, accelerate structure formation, and exert thermal feedback on the surrounding medium via accretion. Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation from accreting PBHs suppresses H$2$ cooling, shifting the dominant gas coolant to atomic hydrogen. When combined with significant baryon-dark matter streaming velocities ($v_{b\\chi} \\gtrsim 0.8 \\sigma_{b\\chi}$, where $\\sigma_{b\\chi}$ is the root-mean-square streaming velocity), these effects facilitate the formation of dense, gravitationally unstable, atomically cooling gas clouds in the PBH's wake. These clouds exhibit sustained high inflow rates ($\\dot{M}_{infall} \\gtrsim 0.01 - 0.1 M_\\odot yr^{-1}$), providing ideal conditions for DCBH formation from rapidly growing supermassive stars of $\\sim 10^5 M_\\odot$ at redshifts $z \\sim 20 - 10$. The resulting systems form SMBH binaries with initial mass ratios $q \\sim O(0.1)$ and separations of $\\sim 10$ pc. Such PBH-DCBH binaries provide testable predictions for JWST and ALMA, potentially explaining select high-$z$ sources such as the Little Red Dots (LRDs), and represent gravitational-wave sources for future missions like LISA and TianQin-bridging early-Universe black hole physics, multi-messenger astronomy, and dark matter theory.",

Azalee Bostroem, Edo Berger, Peter Blanchard Submitted to Nature; received first report, will update with revisions. 43 pages, 10 figures High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) are at least an order of magnitude brighter than standard supernovae, with the internal power source for their luminosity still unknown. The central engines of SLSNe-I are hypothesized to be magnetars, but the majority of SLSNe-I light curves have multiple bumps or peaks that are unexplained by the standard magnetar model. Existing explanations for the bumps either modulate the central engine luminosity or invoke interactions with material in the circumstellar environment. Systematic surveys of the limited sample of SLSNe-I light curves find no compelling evidence favoring either scenario, leaving both the nature of the light-curve fluctuations and the applicability of the magnetar model unresolved. Here, we report high-cadence multiband observations of an SLSN-I with clear \"chirped\" (i.e., decreasing period) light-curve bumps that can be directly linked to the properties of the magnetar central engine. Our observations are consistent with a tilted, infalling accretion disk undergoing Lense-Thirring precession around a magnetar centrally located within the expanding supernova ejecta. Our model demonstrates that the overall light curve and bump frequency independently and self-consistently constrain the spin period and the magnetic field strength of the magnetar. Assuming standard accretion disk parameters, we constrain the accretion rate onto the magnetar. Our results provide the first observational evidence of the Lense-Thirring effect in the environment of a magnetar, and confirm the magnetar spin-down model as an explanation for the extreme luminosity observed in SLSNe-I. We anticipate this discovery will create avenues for testing general relativity in a new regime -- the violent centers of young supernovae.",

To this end, we introduce helium- and carbon-like ions at solar abundances into two-dimensional hybrid (kinetic ions--fluid electrons) simulations of non-relativistic collisionless shocks. This study yields three main results: 1) Heavy ions are preferentially accelerated compared to hydrogen. For typical solar abundances, the energy transferred to accelerated helium ions is comparable to, or even exceeds, that of hydrogen, thereby enhancing the overall shock acceleration efficiency. 2) Accelerated helium ions contribute to magnetic field amplification, which increases the maximum attainable particle energy and steepen the spectra of accelerated particles. 3) The efficient acceleration of helium significantly enhances the production of hadronic gamma rays and neutrinos, likely dominating the one due to hydrogen. These effects should be taken into account, especially when modeling strong space and astrophysical shocks.",

Comments welcome! High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We model the absorption of X-rays by gas obscuring the source and photoionized by it. We consider a broad range of column densities, including both Thomson-thin and Thomson-thick media. For the Thomson thin regime, we derive a simple criterion, based on the source luminosity and spectrum and the medium radius and column density, that distinguish between the following cases: (i) The absorption can be modeled well by a neutral medium; (ii) The radiation ionizes its way through the medium and no absorption is expected; and (iii) A detailed model is required because the column density inferred from modeling the absorption with a neutral gas is much lower than the actual column density, or because the absorption features cannot be fitted by a neutral absorber. We derive the criterion analytically using a toy model of hydrogen and oxygen, and calibrate it for realistic compositions with metallicities in the range $Z/Z_{\\odot}=0.01-50$, using CLOUDY. We generalize the model to the Thomson-thick regime, where we consider, alongside photoabsorption, electron scattering, Compton heating, Comptonization, and photon degradation. In this case, the emergent spectrum depends on the boundary condition experienced by photons scattered back towards the source. We discuss the effect of a reflective boundary and a reprocessing boundary. We provide simple criteria for the expected absorption state, and discuss additional effects that alter the spectrum. The main motivation of our modeling is X-ray emission from supernovae interacting with circumstellar medium; however, we expect it to be useful to many other applications.",

Traditional and some recent machine learning-based classification schemes predominantly rely on observer-frame physical parameters, which are significantly affected by the redshift effects and may not accurately represent the intrinsic properties of GRBs. In particular, the progenitors usually could only be decided by successful detection of the multi-band long-term afterglow, which could easily cost days of devoted effort from multiple global observational utilities. In this work, we apply the unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithms called t-SNE and UMAP to perform GRB classification based on rest-frame prompt emission parameters. The map results of both t-SNE and UMAP reveal a clear division of these GRBs into two clusters, denoted as GRBs-I and GRBs-II. We find that all supernova-associated GRBs, including the atypical short-duration burst GRB 200826A (now recognized as collapsar-origin), consistently fall within the GRBs-II category. Conversely, all kilonova-associated GRBs (except for two controversial events) are classified as GRBs-I, including the peculiar long-duration burst GRB 060614 originating from a merger event. In another words, this clear ML separation of two types of GRBs based only on prompt properties could correctly predict the results of progenitors without follow-up afterglow properties. Comparative analysis with conventional classification methods using $T_{90}$ and $E_{\\rm p,z}$--$E_{\\rm iso}$ correlation demonstrates that our machine learning approach provides superior discriminative power, particularly in resolving ambiguous cases of hybrid GRBs.",

Blasi (GSSI, INFN) Manuscript accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The escape of accelerated particles from supernova remnants remains one of the central and yet least understood aspects of the origin of cosmic rays. Here we use the results of the recent LHAASO observation of gamma rays from a region of $\\sim 2$ degrees around the Cassiopeia A (Cas A) supernova remnant to constrain the process of particle escape from this remnant. We dedicate special attention to discuss the impact of shock evolution and particle propagation in the near source region on the gamma ray emission. This is very important to assess the possibility that very high-energy protons may have been accelerated in past activity of Cas A. Given the core collapse nature of Cas A and its young age ($\\sim 340$ years), the non detection of $\\gtrsim 100$ TeV gamma rays from this remnant allows us to draw some conclusions on the role of supernova explosions for the origin of cosmic rays at the knee. In particular we calculate the spectrum of cosmic rays that may have escaped this remnant to make a clear distinction between the instantaneous maximum energy and the one that appears as a flux suppression in the time integrated spectrum from an individual supernova. LHAASO observation of the region around Cas A as well as gamma ray observations of the remnant itself confirm that this remnant is not operating as a PeVatron and that, although in the early stages the maximum energy may have reached $\\sim$Peta-electronVolt, the number of such particles in the surroundings of Cas A is exceedingly small.",

Cross-calibration of X-ray instruments used in the large, multi-mission observational campaign XRISM collaboration 12 pages, 12 figures, Astronomy & Astrophysics, accepted for publication High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Accurate X-ray spectroscopic measurements are fundamental for deriving basic physical parameters of the most abundant baryon components in the Universe. The plethora of X-ray observatories currently operational enables a panchromatic view of the high-energy emission of celestial sources. However, uncertainties in the energy-dependent calibration of the instrument transfer functions (e.g. the effective area, energy redistribution, or gain) can limit - and historically, did limit - the accuracy of X-ray spectroscopic measurements. We revised the status of the cross-calibration among the scientific payload on board four operation missions: Chandra, NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, and the recently launched XRISM. XRISM carries the micro-calorimeter Resolve, which yields the best energy resolution at energies above 2 keV. For this purpose, we used the data from a 10-day-long observational campaign targeting the nearby active galactic nucleus NGC 3783, carried out in July 2024. We present a novel model-independent method for assessing the cross-calibration status that is based on a multi-node spline of the spectra with the highest-resolving power (XRISM/Resolve in our campaign). We also estimated the impact of the intrinsic variability of NGC 3783 on the cross-calibration status due to the different time coverages of participating observatories and performed an empirical reassessment of the Resolve throughput at low energies. Based on this analysis, we derived a set of energy-dependent correction factors of the observed responses, enabling a statistically robust analysis of the whole spectral dataset. They will be employed in subsequent papers describing the astrophysical results of the campaign.",

The MAGIC data are also released in a Data Level 3 (DL3) format and can be downloaded from this https URL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) In April 2013, the TeV blazar Markarian~421 underwent one of its most powerful emission outbursts to date. An extensive multi-instrument campaign featuring MAGIC, VERITAS, and \\textit{NuSTAR} provided comprehensive very-high-energy (VHE; $E > 100$\\,GeV) and X-ray coverage over nine consecutive days. In this work, we perform a detailed spectral analysis of the X-ray and VHE emissions on sub-hour timescales throughout the flare. We identify several clockwise spectral hysteresis loops in the X-rays, revealing a spectral evolution more complex than a simple harder-when-brighter trend. The VHE spectrum extends beyond 10\\,TeV, and its temporal evolution closely mirrors the behavior in the X-rays. We report the first evidence of VHE spectral hysteresis occurring simultaneously with the X-ray loops. To interpret these findings, we apply a time-dependent leptonic model to 240 broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) binned on a 15-minute scale, allowing us to self-consistently track the particle distribution's history. Our modeling shows that the majority of the sub-hour flux and spectral variations are driven by changes in the luminosity and slope of the injected electron distribution. The required variations in the electron slope are difficult to reconcile with magnetic reconnection but are consistent with a shock-acceleration scenario where the shock compression ratio evolves by a factor of $\\sim2$. The model also points to a relatively stable magnetic field and emitting region size, favoring a scenario where the emission originates from a stationary feature in the jet, such as a recollimation shock. However, this scenario requires a jet Lorentz factor that significantly exceeds values from VLBI measurements to account for the high minimum electron energy implied by the lack of variability in the optical band.",

Fiore Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) To improve our knowledge of nuclear emission in luminous QSOs at Cosmic Noon, we studied the X-ray emission of the WISE/SDSS-selected hyper-luminous (WISSH) QSO sample: 85 broad-line AGN with $L_{bol}>few\\times 10^{47}\\,erg\\,s^{-1}$ at $z\\sim 2-4$. Our aim is to characterise their X-ray spectra and explore relations between X-ray luminosity and other bands, comparing powerful QSOs with the general AGN population. We performed spectral analysis for about half of the sample; 16 sources were analysed via their hardness ratio; for the others we estimated their intrinsic luminosity $L_{2-10\\,keV}$. Only 8 sources are undetected. We report a large dispersion in $L_{2-10\\,keV}$ despite the narrow distribution of $L_{bol}$, $L_{2500\\,Å}$ and $\\lambda L_{6\\,\\mu m}$ (about one-third of the sources classified as X-ray weak). This suggests differences in X-ray corona and accretion flow physics between hyper-luminous and less powerful AGN. X-ray photon index distribution is consistent with that of lower-$z$, lower-$L_{bol}$ AGN, and does not depend on the Eddington ratio ($\\lambda_{Edd}$) or X-ray weakness. Most WISSH QSOs with intrinsic absorption estimates show little to no obscuration ($N_H \\le 5\\times 10^{22}\\,cm^{-2}$). Among the obscured sources we find blue QSOs without broad absorption lines within the \"forbidden region\" of the $Log(N_H)-Log(\\lambda_{Edd})$ plane, typically occupied by dust-reddened QSOs and associated with intense feedback. We confirm a correlation between $L_{2-10\\,keV}$ and CIV line blueshift, a tracer of nuclear ionized outflows. Multi-wavelength data and complete X-ray coverage enabled the investigation of the disk-corona interplay at the highest luminosity regimes. The broad distribution of bolometric correction and X-ray - to - optical index suggest caution when using $L_{bol}$, $L_{2500\\,Å}$ or $L_{6\\,\\mu m}$ as direct X-ray proxy for individual luminous QSOs.",

      "abstract": "Black hole mass function shift in proto-stellar-clusters driven by gas accretion Zacharias Roupas Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has observed compact, massive proto-stellar clusters of low metallicity in the Cosmic Gems arc galaxy at high redshift, which represent likely precursors to globular clusters. We model the mass growth of stellar black holes (BHs) during the first few Myr of the life of a massive, compact, gaseous stellar cluster before stellar feedback expels the primordial gas. At high redshift, in a lower metallicity environment stellar winds get weaker allowing for larger gas-depletion time-scales in the cluster despite of energetic pair-instability supernova (PISN) feedback for sufficiently compact clusters. Mass segregation drives the massive stellar progenitors of BHs in the center of the cluster where gas is most dense. We estimate the conditions for which the initial black hole mass function (BHMF), with a PISN-induced cut-off $<55{\\rm M}_\\odot$, gets shifted to values within the upper BH mass gap, $\\sim 60-130{\\rm M}_\\odot$, or higher, as observed by Gravitational Wave (GW) experiments LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. We find that the BHs are shifted by the end of gas depletion to values within and above the mass gap, well within the range of BH components of the recent GW-signal GW231123, depending on total mass, star formation efficiency, metallicity and compactness. The individual BH mass increase follows approximately a surprisingly steep power law with respect to initial BH mass with an exponent in the range $\\approx 4-6$. This occurs in gaseous proto-stellar clusters that are sufficiently massive and compact, with typical values of total mass $\\sim 10^6{\\rm M}_\\odot$ and size $\\sim 1{\\rm pc}$. Our analysis suggests that proto-stellar clusters at high redshift such as Cosmic Gems arc clusters have generated through early gas accretion, BHs as heavy as $\\sim 10^2-10^3{\\rm M}_\\odot$.",

We study a NaCl-doped detector and model its response to (i) monochromatic thermal neutrons and (ii) the natural thermal-neutron flux expected from dry soil at the elevation of Bucaramanga, Colombia. The ambient flux is estimated with the ARTI framework, and the detector response is simulated with MEIGA in Geant4. Doping with NaCl introduces additional capture channels on $^{35,37}\\mathrm{Cl}$ and $^{23}\\mathrm{Na}$; in particular, $^{35}\\mathrm{Cl}$ has a thermal-neutron absorption cross section up to two orders of magnitude larger than hydrogen, boosting the capture signal. Our results indicate that water Cherenkov detectors can detect thermal neutrons with practical sensitivity under field conditions, enabling their integration into precision agriculture networks for soil moisture sensing. More broadly, this approach extends the cosmic-ray detection range of Cherenkov detectors using non-toxic, low-cost materials.",

Tucker Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) In November 2020, the Swift team announced a major update to the calibration of the UltraViolet and Optical Telescope (UVOT) data to correct for the gradual loss of sensitivity over time. Beginning in roughly 2015, the correction affected observations in the three near ultraviolet (UV) filters, reaching levels of up to 0.3 mag immediately prior to the correction. Over the same time period, an increasing number of Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) were discovered and studied. Many SLSNe-I are hot (T$_\\textrm{eff}$ $\\approx 10,000$ K) near peak, and therefore accurate UV data are imperative towards properly understanding their physical properties and energetics. We recompute Swift UVOT photometry for SLSNe-I discovered between 2014 and 2021 with at least 5 Swift observations in 2015 or later. We calculate host-subtracted magnitudes for each SLSN and fit their spectral energy distributions with modified blackbodies to obtain the radius and temperature evolution. We also fit multi-band photometry using the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients (MOSFiT) to obtain key parameters such as the spin period (P), magnetic field strength (B), ejecta mass (M$_\\textrm{ej}$), and kinetic energy (E$_\\textrm{kin}$). From our MOSFiT modeling, we also estimate the peak UV/optical luminosity (L$_\\textrm{peak}$) and the radiative energy (E$_\\textrm{rad}$). Under the assumption of magnetar-powered SLSNe, we find several strong trends, including anti-correlations between P and both L$_\\textrm{peak}$ and E$_\\textrm{rad}$, a correlation between E$_\\textrm{kin}$ and E$_\\textrm{rad}$, and an anti-correlation between B and E$_\\textrm{rad}$.",

In this paper, we extend the search to unprecedented territories, detailing our extensive observations at 6 GHz and initiating the first-ever survey at 18 GHz with the Sardinia Radio Telescope (SRT). Our strategy entailed rigorous observation sessions, totaling 36 hours, directed towards the Galactic Center and 72 selected TESS targets-making this the most comprehensive high-frequency technosignature search to date. Our narrowband signal search found no definitive evidence of drifting signals that could suggest an extraterrestrial origin from the surveyed regions. Nevertheless, our efforts have enabled us to set new constraints on the presence of radio emissions from approximately $5\\times 10^{5}$ stars, establishing an isotropic radiated power limit of $1.8\\times 10^{19} W$. We also provide a comparative analysis of the 'hits' recorded across both frequencies to highlight the significance of pursuing technosignature searches at higher frequencies, where the spectral landscape is less congested and more conducive to detection.",

When performing numerical simulations of resistive magnetohydrodynamics, one is faced with the issue that Amperes law becomes stiff in the high conductivity limit which poses challenges to the numerical evolution. We show that using a description of resistive magnetohydrodynamics based on higher form symmetry, one can perform simulations with a generalized dual Faraday tensor without having to use Amperes Law, thereby avoiding the stiffness problem. We also explain the relation of this dual model to a traditional description of resistive magnetohydrodynamics and how causality is guaranteed by introducing second order corrections.",

We review extensive observational results of rotation-powered pulsars, magnetars, X-ray dim isolated neutron stars and central compact objects, highlighting the unique properties and recent discoveries of these neutron star classes.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Polarisation measurements of gamma-ray burst afterglows provide a powerful tool for probing the structure of relativistic jets. In this study, we revisit polarisation signals observed in gamma-ray burst afterglows, focusing on the effects of non-axisymmetric jet structures. To characterize these non-axisymmetric jets, we adopt a simple elliptical jet head model and investigate how deviations from axisymmetry influence the temporal evolution of polarisation properties, particularly around the jet break. Our results show that the polarisation degree curve typically exhibits two peaks for top-hat jets or a single peak for structured jets, even in the presence of an elliptical jet head. In non-axisymmetric jets, a complete drop in polarisation between peaks is generally absent, and the position angle rotation between the peaks can deviate significantly from 90 degrees. In single-peak cases, the polarisation position angle evolves gradually, contrasting with the constant position angle expected in axisymmetric jets. We also explore the implications of these findings for recent GRB events, including GRB 121024A, GRB 091018, GRB 020813, and GRB 210610B.",

Their low-frequency millimeter and radio properties, on the other hand, remain poorly understood. We present observations of the millimeter and radio emission of binaries where a neutron star accretes from an OB supergiant. We report ALMA and NOEMA millimeter observations of twelve systems, supplemented by VLA radio observations of six of those targets. Our targets include six Supergiant X-ray Binaries (SgXBs), four Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs), and two intermediate systems. Nine out of twelve targets, including all SFXTs, are detected in at least one millimeter band, while in the radio, only two targets are detected. All detected targets display inverted radio/millimeter spectra, with spectral indices in the range $\\alpha =0.6-0.8$ for those systems where accurate SED fits could be performed. We conclude, firstly, that the low-frequency SEDs of neutron star SFXTs and SgXBs are dominated by free-free emission from the OB supergiant's stellar wind, and that jet emission is unlikely to be observed unless the systems can be detected at sub-GHz frequencies. Secondly, we find that SFXTs are fainter at 100 GHz than prototypical SgXBs, probably due to systematically less dense winds in the former, as supported further by the differences in their fluorescence Fe K$\\alpha$ lines. We furthermore compare the stellar wind constraints obtained from our millimeter observations with those from IR/optical/UV studies and bow shock detections, and present evidence for long-term stellar wind variability visible in the thermal emission.",

Subsequent observations, including late-time spectra with JWST, have highlighted the need for accurate modeling of kilonova ejecta. In the photospheric phase, atomic level populations can be estimated under LTE using Boltzmann and Saha relations, but about a week after the merger the ejecta enters the nebular phase where non-LTE effects dominate. Modeling nebular spectra therefore requires a detailed treatment of radiative and collisional processes that affect the population of atomic levels. This work focuses on electron-impact excitation in Sr II, a heavy ion relevant for kilonova spectra. Two computational approaches are employed: the Plane Wave Born approximation within the pseudo-relativistic Hartree-Fock method, and a Distorted Waves method using AUTOSTRUCTURE. The resulting collision strengths are compared against reference R-matrix data to evaluate the accuracy of these approximations and their suitability for large-scale applications to all heavy elements. In addition, radiative parameters for forbidden transitions are computed. These results provide an essential benchmark of approximations that could be used to compute atomic data for nebular-phase kilonova modeling.",

Submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Observations of extreme starbursts, often located in the cores of protoclusters, challenge the classical bottom-up galaxy formation paradigm. Giant elliptical galaxies at $z=0$ must have assembled rapidly, possibly within few 100 Myr through an extreme growth phase at high-redshift, characterized by elevated star-formation rates of several thousand solar masses per year distributed over concurrent, gas-rich mergers. We present a novel view of the $z=4.3$ protocluster core SPT2349$-$56 from sensitive multi-cycle ALMA dust continuum and [CII]158$\\mu$m line observations. Distributed across 60 kpc, a highly structured gas reservoir with a line luminosity of $L_\\mathrm{[CII]}=3.0\\pm0.2\\times10^9$ $L_\\odot$ and an inferred cold gas mass of $M_{gas}= 8.9\\pm0.7\\times10^{9}$ $M_\\odot$ is found surrounding the central massive galaxy triplet. Like ``beads on a string'', the newly-discovered [CII] streamers fragment into a few kpc-spaced and turbulent clumps that have a similar column density as local Universe spiral galaxy arms at $\\Sigma_{gas}=20$--$60$ $M_\\odot$ pc$^{-2}$. For a dust temperature of 30 K, the [CII] emission from the ejected clumps carry $\\gtrsim$3% of the FIR luminosity, translating into an exceptionally low mass-to-light ratio of $\\alpha_\\mathrm{[CII]}=2.95\\pm0.3$ $M_\\odot$ $L_\\odot^{-1}$, indicative of shock-heated molecular gas. In phase space, about half of the galaxies in the protocluster core populate the same caustic as the [CII] streamers ($r/r_{vir}\\times|\\Delta v|/\\sigma_{vir}\\approx0.1$), suggesting angular momentum dissipation via tidal ejection while the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) is assembling. Our findings provide new evidence for the importance of tidal ejections of [CII]-bright, shocked material following multiple major mergers that might represent a landmark phase in the $z\\gtrsim4$ co-evolution of BCGs with their hot, metal enriched atmospheres.",

This paper has been resubmitted to MNRAS after one round of minor referee comments Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We used observations from the \\emph{JWST} Emission Line Survey (JELS) to measure the half-light radii ($r_{e}$) of 23 H$\\alpha$-emitting star-forming (SF) galaxies at $z=6.1$ in the PRIMER/COSMOS field. Galaxy sizes were measured in \\emph{JWST} Near-infrared Camera observations in rest-frame H$\\alpha$ (tracing recent star formation) with the F466N and F470N narrowband filters from JELS, and compared against rest-$R$-band, $V$-band (tracing established stellar populations) and near-ultraviolet sizes. We find a size-stellar mass ($r_{e}-M_{*}$) relationship with a slope that is consistent with literature values at lower redshifts, though offset to lower sizes. We observe a large scatter in $r_{e}$ at low stellar mass ($M_{*}<10^{8.4}$ M$_{\\odot}$) which we believe is the result of bursty star formation histories (SFHs) of SF galaxies at the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We find that the stellar and ionised gas components are similar in size at $z=6.1$. The evidence of already-established stellar components in these H$\\alpha$ emitters (HAEs) indicates previous episodes of star formation have occurred. As such, following other JELS studies finding our HAEs are undergoing a current burst of star formation, we believe our results indicate that SF galaxies at the end of the EoR have already experienced a bursty SFH. From our $r_{e}-M_{*}$ relationship, we find $r_{e, \\text{F444W}}=0.76\\pm0.46$ kpc for fixed stellar mass $M_{*}=10^{9.25}$ M$_{\\odot}$, which is in agreement with other observations and simulations of star forming galaxies in the literature.

We demonstrate that the combination of Via Machinae 3.0 with Cathode, called VM3-C, not only re-discovers previously known streams, but also confirms many candidate streams identified in combination with Anode (denoted VM3-A). Compared to VM3-A, the number of stream candidates detected by VM3-C increases by around 10%. Moreover, both of the methods discover the same two large clusters of stream candidates in the Northern Galactic hemisphere. We dub these highly significant anomalous structures the Raritan stream and the Passaic stream.

Cueli, Tom Bakx, Jose M. Casas, Rebeca Fernández-Fernández, David Crespo Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a new and independent methodology for identifying gravitational lens candidates using data from the H-ATLAS and AllWISE surveys. Unlike previous approaches, which are typically biased toward bright, strongly lensed submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), our method uncovers fainter systems with lower magnifications. This enables the identification and individual study of lensing events that would otherwise only be accessible through statistical weak lensing analyses. Our approach focuses on high-redshift SMGs from H-ATLAS in the range $1.2 < z < 4.0$, and searches for associated AllWISE sources within an angular distance of 18 arcsec. Candidate lenses are selected based on their WISE colors ($0.5 < \\mathrm{W2} - \\mathrm{W3} < 1.5$ mag), consistent with those of elliptical galaxies, and further filtered using $J-\\mathrm{W1}$ color and photometric redshift cuts to reduce stellar contamination. This conservative selection yields 68 new lens candidates. We then performed SED fitting with CIGALE across UV to submillimeter wavelengths to estimate the physical properties of both the lenses and the background SMGs, and to assess the lensing nature of these candidates. Despite the uncertainties, we were able to constrain key parameters such as stellar and dust masses, infrared luminosities, and star formation rates. In addition, the estimated magnifications for most candidates are modest, consistent with the weak lensing regime ($\\mu \\simeq 1{-}1.5$), although a few sources may require more precise modeling. Future efforts could refine this methodology to recover potential candidates outside our selection, and high-resolution follow-up observations will be essential to confirm the lensing nature of these sources and to further investigate their physical properties.",

Zafar 13 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The central regions of disc galaxies host a rich variety of stellar structures: nuclear discs, bars, bulges, and boxy-peanut (BP) bulges. These components are often difficult to disentangle, both photometrically and kinematically, particularly in star-forming galaxies where dust obscuration and complex stellar motions complicate interpretation. In this work, we use data from the GECKOS-MUSE survey to investigate the impact of dust on axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian Expansion (JAM) models, and assess their ability to recover kinematic structure in edge-on disc galaxies. We construct JAM models for a sample of seven edge-on ($i \\gtrapprox 85^\\circ$) galaxies that span a range of star formation rates, dust content, and kinematic complexity. We find that when dust is appropriately masked, the disc regions of each galaxy are fit to $\\chi^2_{\\text{reduced}}\\leq 5$. We analyse two-dimensional residual velocity fields to identify signatures of non-axisymmetric structure. We find that derived dynamical masses are constant within 10% for each galaxy across all dust masking levels. In NGC 3957, a barred boxy galaxy in our sample, we identify velocity residuals that persist even under aggressive dust masking, aligned with bar orbits and supported by photometric bar signatures. We extend this analysis to reveal a bar in IC 1711 and a possible side-on bar in NGC 0522. Our results highlight both the capabilities and limitations of JAM in dusty, edge-on systems and attempt to link residual velocities to known non-axisymmetric kinematic structure.",

Matta Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The detection of interstellar C$_{60}^{+}$ has been debated for 30 years. The contested attribution of a weaker DIB at 9365 Å was re-evaluated here on the basis of a Pearson correlation relative to 9577 Å, which was previously tied to C$_{60}^{+}$ by diverse collaborations. An assessment of 11 sightlines revealed a high correlation amongst 9365$-$9577 Å equivalent widths ($r=0.93 \\pm 0.05$), after contamination from an adjacent line was mitigated using both numerical integration and Gaussian fits. In tandem with a recent separate study's high-$r$ evaluation linking 9577$-$9632 Å across a sizable baseline: three interrelated DIBs matching C$_{60}^{+}$ laboratory findings were independently reaffirmed (9365, 9577, 9632 Å). Yet further investigations are required to strengthen the case via two other weak DIBs disputedly linked to C$_{60}^{+}$, particularly owing to potential overlapping lines arising from an expansive chemical space (PAHs).",

Viti 14 pages, 18 figures, submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Recent high resolution mapping of the circum-nuclear regions of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) has revealed the existence of geometrically thin nuclear disks, in general randomly oriented with respect to their galaxy hosts. These molecular tori have typical radii of 10~pc, and contain a few 10$^7$ M$_\\odot$ of H$_2$, with H$_2$ column densities between 10$^{23}$ and 10$^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$. We mapped two of the most massive of these molecular tori with higher resolution, in order to unveil their morphology and kinematics, their possible warp and clumpiness, and derive their stability and life-time. We used the highest resolution possible with ALMA (16~km baseline) in Band 7, taking into account for mapping CO(3-2) and HCO$^+$(4-3) the compromise between sensitivity and resolution. New features are discovered at the high resolution, obtained with a beam of 0.015\\arcsec, equivalent to $\\sim$ 1~pc scale, at their $\\sim$ 15~Mpc distance. The molecular torus in NGC~613 appears like a ring, depleted in molecular gas near the center. The depletion region is displaced by 3~pc towards the NW from the AGN position, meaning some $m=1$ asymmetry in the torus. The molecular torus in NGC~1672 has now a different position angle from previous observations, and is edge-on, revealing a geometrically very thin torus, with a clear warp. This confirms that the classical model of a simple geometrically thick dusty torus is challenged by high resolution observations. The nuclear disks appear clumpy, and slightly lopsided. The molecular outflow in NGC~613 is now resolved out. Well inside the sphere of influence of the black holes (BH), we are now able to determine more accurately their mass, for those Seyfert spiral galaxies, in a region of the M-sigma relation where the scatter is maximum.",

Tailo 10 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The stellar initial mass function (IMF) and the fraction of binary systems are fundamental ingredients that govern the formation and evolution of galaxies. Whether the IMF is universal or varies with environment remains one of the central open questions in astrophysics. Dwarf galaxies such as the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), with their low metallicity and diffuse star-forming regions, offer critical laboratories to address this issue. In this work, we exploit ultra-deep photometry from the James Webb Space Telescope to investigate the stellar populations in the field of the SMC. Using the $m_{\\rm F322W2}$ versus $m_{\\rm F115W}-m_{\\rm F322W2}$ color-magnitude diagram (CMD), we derive the luminosity function and measure the fraction of unresolved binary systems. We find a binary fraction of $f_{\\rm bin}^{q>0.6}=0.14\\pm0.01$, consistent with results from synthetic CMDs incorporating the metallicity distribution of the SMC. Additionally, the measured binary fraction in the SMC field is consistent with those observed in Galactic open clusters and Milky Way field stars of similar ages and masses, suggesting similar binary formation and evolutionary processes across these low-density environments. By combining the luminosity function with the best-fit isochrone, we derive the the mass function (MF) down to $0.22\\,M_{\\odot}$, the lowest mass limit reached for the SMC to date. The resulting MF follows a power-law with a slope of $\\alpha=-1.99\\pm0.08$. This value is shallower than the canonical Salpeter slope of $\\alpha=-2.35$, providing new evidence for IMF variations in low-metallicity and low-density environments.",

Additional 10 appendix pages, with 7 figures and 2 tables. Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics (A&A) Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Mass transfer between stars in binary systems profoundly impacts their evolution, yet many aspects of this process (especially the stability, mass loss, and eventual fate of such systems) remain poorly understood. One promising avenue to constrain these processes is through the identification and characterisation of systems undergoing active mass transfer. Inspired by the slow brightening preceding stellar merger transients, we worked on a method to identify Galactic mass-transferring binaries in which the donor is a Hertzsprung gap (HG) star. We constructed an initial sample of HG stars using the Gaia EDR3 contribution Starhorse catalogue, and we identified candidate mass-transferring systems by selecting sources that exhibit Balmer emission features (using the low-resolution Gaia XP spectra), mid-infrared excess (from WISE photometry), and photometric variability (inferred from the error in the Gaia G-band magnitude). This multi-criteria selection yielded a sample of 67 candidates, which we further analysed using complementary photometric and spectroscopic data. Among our candidates, we identified at least nine eclipsing binaries and some sources that are potential binaries as well. Three sources in our sample are strong candidates for mass-transferring binaries with a yellow component, and three more are binaries with a Be star. Notably, four sources in our sample are strong candidates for hosting a compact companion, based on their UV or X-ray signatures. The main sources of contamination in our search are hot but highly reddened stars (primarily Oe and Be stars). As an additional outcome of this work, we present a refined catalogue of 308 bona fide HG stars, selected using improved extinction corrections and stricter emission-line criteria. This enhanced sample is expected to contain a significantly higher fraction of scientifically valuable mass-transferring binaries.",

Wood, Vincent Bourrier, Leonardo dos Santos, Christopher Johns-Krull, George W. King, Jeffrey L. Linsky, Sarah Peacock Accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Obtaining a complete census of gas in the local interstellar medium (<100 pc) is challenging given the limited available tracers of the warm, partially-ionized medium. Medium-to-high resolution UV absorption spectroscopy toward individual nearby stars is the primary method used, and incomplete spatial sampling of this complex medium makes a global map of the material difficult. Using H I column density measurements derived from H I Lyman alpha spectroscopy toward 164 stars inside 100 pc, we have generated 2D spatially-interpolated N(HI) maps for different distance shells. Based on the area-weighted sky averages, we find that sightlines inside 10 pc typically have log N(HI) ~ 17.9. For greater distance shells, log N(HI) increases to 18.3 (10-20 pc), then to 18.4 (20-70 pc), and finally increasing to 18.6 (70-100 pc). This last increase is likely associated with the detection of the Local Bubble boundary, thus making the plateau of column density from 20-70 pc notable and suggestive of the rarity of warm LISM material beyond ~10-20 pc. We estimate that the uncertainties associated with N(HI) values inferred from the interpolated sky maps are approximately inversely correlated with the number of samples in each distance shell and are in the range of 0.20-0.48 dex, compared to 0.01-0.30 dex typically determined from direct Lyman alpha observations. We discuss the impact of these uncertainties on ISM corrections of EUV and Lyman alpha observations for nearby stars. Denser spatial sampling of the sky via UV absorption spectroscopy of nearby stars is required to improve the accuracy of these N(HI) estimates.",

Prince, Reed Riddle Submitted to ApJL; photometry data at this https URL Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We report on the prediscovery observations and constraints of the new interstellar comet 3I/2025 N1 (ATLAS), made by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), for the inbound leg of the comet out to a heliocentric distance of $r_\\mathrm{h}=17$ au, or approximately a year before its discovery. We find that 3I/ATLAS has been active inward of a heliocentric distance of at least $r_\\mathrm{h}=6.5$ au. The comet followed a brightening rate of $\\propto r_\\mathrm{h}^{-3.8}$, which is significantly steeper than the only other known interstellar comet 2I/Borisov, and is more consistent with dynamically old long-period comets and short-period comets in the Solar System. By measuring the brightening of the dust coma, we estimate that 3I had a dust production rate of $\\dot{M_\\mathrm{d}}\\sim5 \\mathrm{kg s^{-1}}$ in early May of 2025 ($r_\\mathrm{h}\\sim6$ au), increasing to $\\dot{M_\\mathrm{d}}\\sim30 \\mathrm{kg s^{-1}}$ towards mid-July 2025 ($r_\\mathrm{h}\\sim4$ au) assuming 100 micron dust grains, in line with the more recent Hubble Space Telescope measurement made at $r_\\mathrm{h}=3.8$ au. Comparison with the prediscovery photometry by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) suggested that 3I started producing constant dust outflow probably around $r_\\mathrm{h}\\sim9$ au, coinciding with the turn-on distance of CO$_2$ ice. We also conduct a deep search of 3I/ATLAS with multiple nights of data taken in 2024 when the comet was at $r_\\mathrm{h}=13$-$17$ au and conclude that the comet was no brighter than 2-5 magnitudes above the coma or bare-nucleus lightcurves. This suggests that the comet did not exhibit strong outbursts during these periods, consistent with 2I/Borisov as well as most long-period Solar System comets.",

Here, we employ supercomoving coordinates to study the magnetic field amplification from decaying turbulence during gravitational collapse. We perform three-dimensional simulations and show that for large magnetic Reynolds numbers there can be exponential growth of the comoving magnetic field with conformal time before the decay of turbulence impedes further amplification. The collapse dynamics only affects the nonlinear feedback from the Lorentz force, which diminishes more rapidly for shorter collapse times, allowing nearly kinematic continued growth. We confirm that helical turbulence is more efficient in driving dynamo action than nonhelical turbulence, but this difference decreases for larger collapse times. We also show that for nearly irrotational flows, dynamo amplification is still possible, but it is always associated with a growth of vorticity -- even if it still remains very small. In nonmagnetic runs, the growth of vorticity is associated with viscosity and grows with the Mach number. In the presence of magnetic fields, vorticity emerges from the curl of the Lorentz force. During a limited time interval, an exponential growth of the comoving magnetic field with conformal time is interpreted as clear evidence of dynamo action.",

Comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We report the discovery of a complex, density-stratified interstellar medium (ISM) in the star-forming galaxy COS-2987 at $z = 6.81$, revealed by the unprecedented synergy between JWST/NIRSpec IFS and ALMA observations. These observations detect key emission lines, including \\oii~$\\lambda\\lambda$~3727, 3730, \\oiii~4364, \\oiii~$\\lambda\\lambda$~4960, 5008, \\oiii\\ 88 \\micron, as well as H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$. JWST spectroscopy alone indicates ISM properties that are typical for galaxies at $z\\sim7$. These include low dust extinction ($A_{\\rm V} \\approx 0.14$ mag), moderate electron density ($n_{\\rm e} \\approx 500$~cm$^{-3}$), and low gas-phase metallicity ($\\sim10\\%$). However, the strong far-infrared \\oiii\\ 88 \\micron\\ emission detected by ALMA cannot be explained by a single-component ionized medium with uniform electron density and temperature. Instead, a two-component ISM model, comprising compact, high-temperature, high-density gas components ($T_e \\approx 26,000$\\,K; $n_e \\approx 600~\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$) and an extended, cooler, lower-density component ($T_e \\approx 8,000$\\,K; $n_e \\approx 50~\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$), successfully reproduces the observed line ratios of \\oiii~88~\\micron/\\oiii~5008~Å and \\oiii~4364/\\oiii~5008~Å, with a volume ratio of 1 : 300 between the two components. Our results demonstrate that JWST alone probes only a fraction of the ISM and highlight the critical importance of combining JWST and ALMA to reveal the density-stratified ISM of early galaxies.",

Yi 16 pages, 7 figures. Accepted for publication in ApJ after minor revision Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We build upon FEGA25 (Contini et al 2025), a previously introduced semi-analytic model for galaxy formation and evolution, focusing on its enhanced treatment of supernova and active galactic nucleus feedback mechanisms. In addition to the traditional AGN feedback modes, negative (suppressing cooling), and the new positive mode (triggering star formation), we introduce two implementations of a third mode: the ejection of hot gas beyond the virial radius, AGNeject1 and AGNeject2. This component addresses a longstanding issue in semi-analytic models and hydrodynamical simulations: the overestimation of hot gas fractions in low and intermediate mass halos. FEGA25 is calibrated via MCMC using a suite of cosmological N-body simulations YS50HR, YS200, and YS300, and a comprehensive set of observed stellar mass functions across a wide redshift range. We find that supernova feedback dominates gas ejection in halos with logM_{halo} < approximately 12, while AGN feedback becomes increasingly important at higher halo masses. The AGNeject2 model, which activates primarily at late times, redshift < 1, reproduces a characteristic cavity, a U shaped feature in the baryon fraction at redshift zero, similar to trends observed in simulations like SIMBA and IllustrisTNG. Conversely, AGNeject1 yields a smoother, redshift independent evolution. Both models preserve the stellar and cold gas components and successfully reproduce the stellar to halo mass relation up to redshift 3. Our results emphasize that a physically motivated AGN driven mechanism capable of selectively removing hot gas is essential to accurately model the baryon cycle, particularly in intermediate halo mass regimes.",

Submitted to Memorie della SAIt, under review. Comments welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The stellar initial mass function (sIMF) describes the distribution of stellar masses formed in a single star formation event in a molecular cloud clump. It is fundamental to astrophysics and cosmology, shaping our understanding of unresolved stellar populations, galactic chemical enrichment and habitable zones, and black hole growth. This White Paper reviews studies on the core mass function, stellar multiplicity, and dynamical processes affecting sIMF determinations, as well as the link between star-forming clumps and the galaxy-wide IMF (gIMF). The evidence gleaned from observed systems for the dependency of the sIMF on the metallicity and density of the clump is portrayed. We examine evidence from gravitational lensing, stellar and gas kinematics, and spectral diagnostics to assess environmental dependencies of the gIMF. Theoretical perspectives provide further insights into the sIMF's variability. Beyond summarizing current knowledge, this work aims to establish a shared framework and define strategies for studying a variable IMF in the era of near-infrared integral-field spectroscopy, 30m-class telescopes and major space-based observatories.",

Using Gaia Data Release 3 data and the advanced clustering algorithms SigMA and Uncover, we identified and characterized these streams beyond the search volume, doubling, on average, their known populations. We estimate the number density of disk streams to be $\\approx 820$ objects / kpc$^3$ (for $|Z| < 100$ pc), or surface densities of $\\approx 160$ objects / kpc$^2$. These estimates surpass N-body estimates by one to two orders of magnitude and challenge the prevailing understanding of their destruction mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that these 12 disk streams are dynamically cold with 3D velocity dispersions between 2 and 5 km s$^{-1}$, exhibit narrow sequences in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and are highly elongated with average aspect ratios of 7:1, extending up to several hundred parsecs. We find evidence suggesting that one of the disk streams, currently embedded in the Scorpius-Centaurus association, is experiencing disruption, likely due to the primordial gas mass of the association.",

Shi, W.-P. Liao Mon Not R Astron Soc (2025) 1791-1802 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We re-examine the Bailey diagrams of fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars from the perspective of horizontal branch (HB) evolution, identifying evolutionary effects as the probable direct cause of the Oosterhoff dichotomy. By establishing empirical relationships between pulsation amplitude and average effective temperature, and utilizing pulsation period relations from nonlinear models, we transform theoretical HB evolutionary parameters into pulsation space and map them onto Bailey diagrams. We find that all pulsating Zero-Age Horizontal Branch stars fall within the Oosterhoff type I (OoI) region, with a pronounced period shift effect observed for relatively metal-rich samples ([Fe/H] > -1). Evolutionary tracks confirm that OoI stars are predominantly early-stage HB stars, while Oosterhoff type II stars are highly evolved objects entering the instability strip late in their HB phase from the blue side. Crucially, metallicity plays a dual role: it directly influences pulsation periods through the period relation, but more fundamentally acts as the first parameter influencing HB morphology. This morphology statistically determines whether HB stars predominantly enter the instability strip during early or late evolutionary stages. Consequently, while evolutionary effects directly govern an individual star's position in the Bailey diagram, the population-level Oosterhoff phenomenon emerges from the interplay between these effects and the metallicity-dependent HB morphology. Our study confirms that evolutionary effects are the direct drivers of the period difference and underscores metallicity's vital role in the statistical emergence of Oosterhoff groups. Continued study of this phenomenon offers key insights into the formation history of the Milky Way and nearby dwarf galaxies.",

Infrared spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provides the opportunity to measure its coma composition and determine the primary activity drivers. We report the first results from our JWST NIRSpec campaign for 3I/ATLAS, at an inbound heliocentric distance of $r_H=3.32$ au. The spectral images (spanning 0.6-5.3 $\\mu$m) reveal a CO2 dominated coma, with enhanced outgassing in the sunward direction, and the presence of H2O, CO, OCS, water ice and dust. The coma CO2/H2O mixing ratio of $7.6\\pm0.3$ is among the highest ever observed in a comet, and is 4.5-sigma above the trend as a function of heliocentric distance for long-period and Jupiter-family comets (excluding the outlier C/2016 R2). Our observations are compatible with an intrinsically CO2-rich nucleus, which may indicate that 3I/ATLAS contains ices exposed to higher levels of radiation than Solar System comets, or that it formed close to the CO2 ice line in its parent protoplanetary disk. A low coma H2O gas abundance may also be implied, for example, due to inhibited heat penetration into the nucleus, which could suppress the H2O sublimation rate relative to CO2 and CO.",

Conventional light curve analysis methods are no longer adequate for handling such massive datasets. To address this challenge, we developed a neural network-based model capable of rapid analysis of multiple-band light curves of contact binaries. Our model can determine the fundamental physical parameters, including temperature and mass ratios, orbital inclination, potential, fillout factor, primary and secondary luminosities and radii, third light contribution, and spot parameters. Notably, unlike previous works, our model can simultaneously process multiple-band light curves and the four parameters of a starspot. The model's reliability was verified through analysis of the synthetic light curves generated by PHOEBE and the light curves of eight targets from \\cite{2024ApJ...976..223W}'s work. The discrepancy distribution between the physical parameters determined by our model and true values for the synthetic light curves shows very good agreement. In addition, the physical parameters determined by our model and the corresponding light curve fits show remarkable consistency with \\cite{2024ApJ...976..223W}'s results. By applying our model to OGLE contact binaries, physical parameters of 3,541 systems were obtained.

Güdel Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Describing the large-scale field topology of protoplanetary disks faces significant difficulties and uncertainties. The transport of the large-scale field inside the disk plays an important role in understanding its evolution. We aim to improve our understanding of the dependencies that stellar magnetic fields pose on the large-scale field. We focus on the innermost disk region ($\\lesssim$ 0.1 AU), which is crucial for understanding the long-term disk evolution. We present a novel approach combining the evolution of a 1+1D hydrodynamic disk with a large-scale magnetic field, consisting of a stellar dipole truncating the disk and a fossil field. The magnetic flux transport includes advection and diffusion due to laminar, non-ideal MHD effects, such as Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion. Due to the implicit nature of the numerical method, long-term simulations (in the order of several viscous timescales) are feasible. The large-scale magnetic field topology in stationary models shows a distinct dependence on specific parameters. The innermost disk region is strongly affected by the stellar rotation period and magnetic field strength. The outer disk regions are affected by the X-ray luminosity and the fossil field. Varying the mass flow through the disk affects the large-scale disk field throughout its radial extent. The topology of the large-scale disk field is affected by several stellar and disk parameters. This will affect the efficiency of MHD outflows, which depend on the magnetic field topology. Such outflows might originate from the very inner disk region, the dead zone, or the outer disk. In subsequent studies, we will use these models as a starting point for conducting long-term evolution simulations of the disk and large-scale field on scales of $\\sim$ 106 years to investigate the combined evolution of the disk, the magnetic field topology, and the resulting MHD outflows.",

Manuscript submitted to Annual Reviews of Astronomy and Astrophysics for Volume 64. This is the authors' submitted version. Revisions and the final version will only become available from this https URL Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) High-precision and long-duration light curves from space telescopes have revolutionized the fields of asteroseismology and binary star systems. In particular, the number of pulsating systems in eclipsing binaries has drastically increased thanks to space-based observations covering almost the entire sky. When combined with multi-epoch spectroscopy, this allows us not only to measure model-independent dynamical masses and radii for thousands of eclipsing binary systems, but also facilitates the powerful synergy of binarity and asteroseismology. Moreover, asteroseismology of pre- and post-interaction binary stars allows the physics of binary evolution to be constrained, including tides, mass transfer, and even mergers. We conclude that: (1) eclipsing binaries are among the best laboratories for testing stellar structure and evolution theory because we are able to measure their masses and radii independently of models; (2) combining binary and asteroseismic modeling yields precise constraints on the physical processes at work within stellar interiors, such as rotation and mixing; (3) pulsating binaries are challenging to study given the plethora of different techniques and physical processes that need to be considered depending on their orbital and physical properties; and (4) the impact of tides on the pulsational, stellar structure, and orbital properties of a binary system can be tested through tidal asteroseismology.",

The new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) presents an opportunity to study PRs at mm and sub-mm wavelengths through a combination of measurements and theoretical modeling. We utilize ALMA single-dish measurements alongside data from other radio instruments to model the PR brightness temperature through adaptation and modification the 1D semi-empirical Avrett-Tian-Landi-Curdt-Wülser (ATLCW) quiet-Sun (QS) model. The calculated and measured PR brightness temperatures were found to be lower than the measured QS value and predictions from the unperturbed ATLCW QS model across the ALMA wavelength range, consistent with PRs appearing in absorption. The PR density was found to be 60 - 163 times higher and temperature 155 - 163 times lower than the QS level, aligning with previous measurements. A key finding emerged with the non-hydrostatic equilibrium assumption, yielding a more physically consistent PR brightness temperature. This suggests that PR stability is most likely maintained by its magnetic field obeying magnetostatic conditions rather than by pure hydrostatic equilibrium, supporting recent studies. Additionally, our results confirm that thermal bremsstrahlung is the dominant radiation mechanism for PRs at mm and sub-mm wavelengths.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) In the near ultraviolet (NUV) part of the solar spectrum, there are several Fe I lines with very broad profiles, typical of chromospheric lines. These lines are largely unexplored due to the lack of high-resolution data in this region. This changed with the successful Sunrise III flight in 2024, when spectro-polarimetric data were recorded with high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution covering a large variety of solar targets. The aim of this work is to investigate the formation of the lines and lay the groundwork for further studies. We compute the spectrum of the lines at 358.12 nm, 371.99 nm, 406.36 nm, and 407.17 nm emerging from the standard 1D FAL-atmospheres using the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) radiative transfer code RH. We find that the lines are affected by overionization in the wings, but have line cores strongly affected by scattering. The line cores form well into the chromosphere in the tested atmosphere models except the colder FALX model where the line core forms in the temperature minimum (which lies at traditional chromospheric heights). In the presence of a vertical magnetic field, the Stokes $V$ signal is multi-lobed. The profile can be decomposed into two broad photospheric lobes and two sharper lobes forming in the flanks of the chromospheric line core. We have investigated the properties of four lines of Fe I that form in the lower chromosphere. The results provide a basic understanding of the formation of the lines, which will be useful for later analysis of formation in 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations and an eventual investigation into their diagnostic potential.",

Ercolano, A. Natta, S. E. van Terwisga Accepted for publication in A&A. 19 pages, 8 figures (including appendix) Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Multiple photometric studies have reported the presence of seemingly older accreting pre-main sequence stars (PMS) in optical colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). We investigate this phenomenon in the Orion Nebula, which harbors a subset of stars that show infrared excess detected by Spitzer and Halpha excess emission, yet display significantly older isochronal ages (>10 Myr) compared to the bulk population (~1-3 Myr) in the r, (r-i) CMD. We perform a detailed spectroscopic analysis of 40 Orion Nebula stars using VLT/X-Shooter, covering CMD-based isochronal ages from 1 to over 30 Myr. We derive extinction values, stellar properties, and accretion parameters by modeling the ultraviolet excess emission through a multicomponent fitting procedure. The sample spans spectral types from M4.5 up to K6, and masses in the range ~0.1-0.8 Msun. We demonstrate that, when extinction and, most importantly, accretion effects are accurately constrained, the stellar luminosity and effective temperature of the majority of the seemingly old stars become consistent with a younger population (~1-5 Myr). This is supported by strong lithium absorption, which corroborates their youth, and by the accretion-to-stellar luminosity ratios typical for young, accreting stars. Three of these sources, however, remain old even after our analysis, despite showing signatures consistent with ongoing accretion from a protoplanetary disc. More generally, our analysis indicates that excess continuum emission from accretion shocks affects the placement of PMS stars in the CMD, displacing sources towards bluer optical colours. This study highlights the critical role of accretion in shaping the stellar properties estimates (including age) derived from optical CMDs and emphasizes the need to carefully account for accretion effects when interpreting age distributions in star-forming regions.",

Using a sample of 108 confirmed brown dwarf companions from the NASA Exoplanet Archive with masses between 13-80 Jupiter masses and orbital semi-major axes between 0.1-5.0 AU, we employ Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical (KS) tests to compare observed orbital distributions with three proposed formation scenarios: (A) disk migration with stellar infall, (B) core accretion with mass-dependent survival probability, and (C) formation bias through dynamical migration. Our systematic grid-search analysis spans 27 parameter combinations for disk migration, 9 for core accretion, and 3 for formation bias models. The disk migration model provides the best statistical fit to observations (KS statistic = 0.100, p-value = 0.216), with optimal parameters {\\mu}_rate = 0.5, {\\sigma}_rate = 0.5, and t-myr = 0.5. The formation bias model achieves intermediate performance (KS = 0.173, p-value = 0.005) with optimal migration fraction p_move = 0.05, while the core accretion scenario shows the poorest fit (KS = 0.417, p-value = 3.5{\\times}10^-17) despite its theoretical appeal. Our results suggest that brown dwarfs primarily form at wide separations and undergo limited inward migration, challenging scenarios that invoke in-situ formation through core accretion processes at close orbital separations.",

Accepted to AAS journals Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The stellar companions in the binary black hole systems Gaia BH2 and BH3, both of which are $\\alpha$-enhanced red giant branch stars, are expected to show normal modes with the characteristic signature of convectively-driven solar-like oscillations. We investigate this using photometry from the TESS mission and find such a signal for Gaia BH2. For Gaia BH2, we measure a power excess frequency of $\\nu_{\\rm max}=60.15\\pm0.57$ $\\mu$Hz and a large separation of $\\Delta\\nu=5.99\\pm0.03$ $\\mu$Hz, yielding a mass of $1.19^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$ M$_\\odot$, which is in agreement with spectroscopically derived parameters. Seismic modeling favors an age for the red giant of $5.03^{+2.58}_{-3.05}$ Gyr, strongly suggesting that it is a young, $\\alpha$-enriched giant star, which are thought to arise from a binary accretion or merger scenario. Ground-based photometry of Gaia BH2 spanning 8 years indicates a photometric period of $398\\pm5$ d, which we tentatively attribute to rotation. If this rotation is physical, it can not be explained solely by evolutionary spin-down or magnetic braking, and implies that the red giant underwent some tidal forcing mechanism. Suggestively, this period is close to the pseudo-synchronous spin period of P$_\\text{spin}=428\\pm1$ days derived from the binary orbit. For Gaia BH3, we are unable to identify an asteroseismic signal in the TESS data despite predicting that the amplitude of the signal should lie well above the measured noise level. We discuss a number of scenarios for why this signal may not be visible.",

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer faster solutions, but are often restricted to shallow models or a few spectral lines. We present a proof-of-concept study using a transformer machine learning (ML) model for multi-line, full-Stokes inversion, to infer stratified parameters from synthetic spectra produced from 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We synthesise a large set of Stokes vectors using forward modelling across 15 spectral lines spanning the deep photosphere towards the chromosphere. The model maps full-Stokes input to temperature, magnetic field strength, inclination, azimuth (encoded as $\\sin2\\phi$, $\\cos2\\phi$), and line-of-sight velocity as a function of optical depth. The transformer incorporates an attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on the most informative regions of the spectrum for each inferred parameter, and uses positional embedding to encode wavelength and depth order. We benchmark it against a multilayer perceptron (MLP), test robustness to noise, and assess generalisation. The transformer outperforms the MLP, especially in the higher layers and for magnetic parameters, yielding higher correlations and more regularised stratifications. The model retains strong performance across a range of noise levels typical for real observations, with magnetic parameter inference degrading predictably while temperature and velocity remain stable. We establish transformer architectures as a powerful tool for spectropolarimetric inversion. This approach paves the way for analysis of large datasets from large solar telescopes.",

Meredith Hughes Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics, 21 pages, 17 figures Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We present new observations that densely sample the microwave (4-360 GHz) continuum spectra from eight young systems in the Taurus region. Multi-component, empirical model prescriptions were used to disentangle the contributions from their dust disks and other emission mechanisms. We found partially optically thick, free-free emission in all these systems, with positive spectral indices (median $\\alpha_{\\rm c} \\approx 1$ at 10 GHz) and contributing 5-50% of the 43 GHz fluxes. There is no evidence for synchrotron or spinning dust grain emission contributions for these targets. The inferred dust disk spectra all show substantial curvature: their spectral indices decrease with frequency, from $\\alpha_{\\rm d} \\approx 2.8$-4.0 around 43 GHz to 1.7-2.1 around 340 GHz. This curvature suggests that a substantial fraction of the (sub)millimeter ($\\gtrsim$ 200 GHz) dust emission may be optically thick, and therefore the traditional metrics for estimating dust masses are flawed. Assuming the emission at lower frequencies (43 GHz) is optically thin, the local spectral indices and fluxes were used to constrain the disk-averaged dust properties and estimate corresponding dust masses. These masses are roughly an order of magnitude higher ($\\approx 1000 \\, M_\\oplus$) than those found from the traditional approach based on (sub)millimeter fluxes. These findings emphasize the value of broad spectral coverage - particularly extending to lower frequencies ($\\sim$cm-band) - for accurately interpreting dust disk emission; such observations may help reshape our perspective on the available mass budgets for planet formation.",

However, a significant source of uncertainty at mid-IR wavelengths on ground-based telescopes is the thermal background. This background comes from blackbody radiation in the atmosphere and telescope and is therefore dependent on instrument design and atmospheric conditions. When performing imaging observations, this background manifests as a slowly varying, inhomogeneous signal throughout the image, underlying our data. Photometry at mid-IR can greatly constrain atmospheric models but existing data are usually scarce or have significant error bars due to the difficulty of subtracting the background. Using M-band direct imaging observing sequences on NIRC2, we evaluate the thermal background of the Keck II telescope and attempt to subtract the background in a more comprehensive way. For our primary science target, the forming protoplanet AB Aur b, we present a contrast upper limit of $2 \\times 10^{-4}$ in M-band and address the limiting factors in our observation due to the thermal background. We determine that the origin of the systematic components of the thermal background comes from the K-mirror and find that the thermal background is also strongly influenced by emission from the secondary spiders on Keck II.",

Erection of a high-altitude hose offers an affordable and near-term approach to deliver sulfur-bearing fluids to the stratosphere in order to perform geoengineering via solar radiation management. We discuss the design of a hose extending to an altitude of 20 km and sized to deliver 100 ktons of sulfur per year. The sulfur, in the form of H$_2$S, is pushed up the hose by a pump on the ground and then sprayed out at the top, forming H$_2$SO$_4$ aerosols which scatter enough sunlight to perform geoengineering. Because the hose operates continuously, it only has to deliver about 50 gallons/minute (little more than a garden hose). The flux from a single hose is not sufficient to stop global warming by itself, but is enough to test the effect of the aerosols, and, once replicated to about 20 sites across the planet, can offset all the warming caused by atmospheric CO$_2$. Two varieties of hose are presented here, one delivering H$_2$S as a liquid and the other as a gas. Pumping liquid H$_2$S through a narrow 20 km hose requires high pressure, which can be handled by strong and lightweight hose walls or by placing intermediate pumps along the hose. The hose is held up by a suite of balloons, either all at its top, or with some placed along its length as well. The greatest challenge in suspending such a hose is wind, which if not dealt with properly (by streamlining both the balloons and the hose) will collapse the hose. The wide hoses needed to deliver gaseous H$_2$S are particularly susceptible to wind, so must be enclosed within lightweight aero-shrouds to reduce wind forces. After treating the design of these two hoses, we lay out the steps needed to develop and fabricate them, and conclude with some thoughts on how the hoses might be fielded.",

Our reaction network now includes crucial reactions involving the first electronically-excited state of atomic nitrogen, recent electron collision cross-sections, and radical chemistry. In particular, we have investigated the influence of C2H2 on the gas phase polymeric growth and the elemental composition of the chemical products, and we have compared our findings to recently published solid phase analyses. The modeling results are consistent with experimental measurements of N2-CH4-C2H2 plasmas on COSmIC, showing the production of C6Hx intermediates and precursors of larger organics, as well as methanimine in small concentration. Our numerical results point to cationic pathways enabling efficient intermediate-sized and nitrogen-rich \\ce{C2H2}-driven chemistry driving tholin production. Comparison of the modeled gas phase elemental composition with elemental composition of the solid phase samples produced in COSmIC reveal similar trends, with C/N increasing when C2H2 is present in the gas mixture. Finally, our results demonstrate the importance of such synergistic studies using low-temperature plasma chemistry experiments combined with modeling efforts to improve our understanding of cold planetary environments.",

Dodson-Robinson Submitted to AJ, accepted September 2, 2025. 19 pages, 6 figures Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Doppler planet searches are complicated by stellar activity, through which cyclical changes in the host star's photosphere and chromosphere can mask or mimic planetary signals. A popular technique for modeling stellar activity is to apply a quasiperiodic Gaussian process (GP) kernel, which provides a flexible model with rigorous error propagation. However, observers must guard against overfitting, as a GP may be flexible enough to subsume other signals besides the one it is intended to model. To counteract overfitting, we introduce a curvature-penalizing objective function for fitting GP models to long-term magnetic activity cycles. We also demonstrate that a Gaussian filter can be an effective method of detrending radial velocities (RVs) so that shorter-period signals can be extracted even in the absence of a mathematical model of the long-term trend. We apply our methods to the heavily studied 55 Cancri system, fitting Keplerian orbits plus the GP activity-cycle model. We show that a 4-Keplerian model that includes planets b, c, e, and f combined with a GP for the activity cycle performs at least as well as the widely agreed-upon 5-planet system with its own GP activity model. Our results suggest that the existence of planet d cannot be established from the RVs alone; additional data are required for confirmation.",

Traditional approaches suffer from critical limitations: spherical harmonics diverge within the Brillouin sphere where spacecraft typically operate, polyhedral models assume unrealistic homogeneous density distributions, and existing machine learning methods like GeodesyNets and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN-GM) require extensive computational resources and training time. This work introduces MasconCubes, a novel self-supervised learning approach that formulates gravity inversion as a direct optimization problem over a regular 3D grid of point masses (mascons). Unlike implicit neural representations, MasconCubes explicitly model mass distributions while leveraging known asteroid shape information to constrain the solution space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse asteroid models including Bennu, Eros, Itokawa, and synthetic planetesimals demonstrates that MasconCubes achieve superior performance across multiple metrics. Most notably, MasconCubes demonstrate computational efficiency advantages with training times approximately 40 times faster than GeodesyNets while maintaining physical interpretability through explicit mass distributions. These results establish MasconCubes as a promising approach for mission-critical gravitational modeling applications requiring high accuracy, computational efficiency, and physical insight into internal mass distributions of irregular celestial bodies.",

Wright 35 pages, 16 figures, 7 tables, data available at this https URL Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We present results from a systematic search for transiting short-period Giant Exoplanets around M-dwarf Stars (GEMS; $P < 10$ days, $R_p \\gtrsim 8~R_\\oplus$) within a distance-limited 100\\,pc sample of 149,316 M-dwarfs using TESS-Gaia Light Curve (TGLC) data. This search led to the discovery of one new candidate GEM, following spectroscopic vetting of 12 additional candidates to eliminate astrophysical false positives and refine our occurrence rate estimates. We describe the development and application of the \\texttt{TESS-miner} package and associated vetting procedures used in this analysis. To assess detection completeness, we conducted $\\sim$ 72 million injection-recovery tests across $\\sim$ 26,000 stars with an average of $\\sim$3 sectors of data per star, subdivided into early-type (M0--M2.5), mid-type (M2.5--M4), and late-type (M4 or later) M-dwarfs. Our pipeline demonstrates high sensitivity across all M-dwarf subtypes within the injection bounds. We estimate the occurrence rates of short-period GEMS as a function of stellar mass, and combine our measured occurrence rates with those derived for FGK stars and fit an exponential trend with stellar mass, consistent with core-accretion theory predictions. We find GEMS occurrence rates of $0.067\\% \\pm 0.047\\%$ for early-type M-dwarfs, $0.139\\% \\pm 0.069\\%$ for mid-type, and $0.032\\% \\pm 0.032\\%$ for late-type M-dwarfs, with a mean rate of $0.065^{+0.025}_{-0.027}\\%$ across the full M-dwarf sample. We note that while our search spanned $1.0~\\mathrm{days} < P < 10.0$ days, these occurrence rates were calculated using planets orbiting with $1.0~\\mathrm{days} < P < 5.0$ days. This work lays the foundation for future occurrence rate investigations for GEMS.",

Rossetti Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We introduce a fast method to measure the conversion gain in Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductors (CMOS) Active Pixel Sensors (APS), which accounts for nonlinearity and interpixel capacitance (IPC). The standard 'mean-variance' method is biased because it assumes pixel values depend linearly on signal, and existing methods to correct for nonlinearity are still introducing significant biases. While current IPC correction methods are prohibitively slow for a per-pixel application, our new method uses separate measurements of the IPC kernel to make an almost instantaneous calculation of gain. Validated using test data from a flight detector from the ESA Euclid mission, the IPC correction recovers the results of slower methods within 0.1% accuracy. Meanwhile the nonlinearity correction ensures an estimation of the gain that is independent of signal, correcting a bias of more than 2.5% on gain estimation.",

Lopes 10 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Recent infrared spectroscopy from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has spurred analyses of common volcanic gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), alongside alkali metals sodium (Na I) and potassium (K I) surrounding the hot Saturn WASP-39 b. We report more than an order-of-magnitude of variability in the density of neutral Na, K, and SO2 between ground-based measurements and JWST, at distinct epochs, hinting at exogenic physical processes similar to those sourcing Io's extended atmosphere and torus. Tidally-heated volcanic satellite simulations sputtering gas into a cloud or toroid orbiting the planet, are able to reproduce the probed line-of-sight column density variations. The estimated SO2 flux is consistent with tidal gravitation predictions, with a Na/SO2 ratio far smaller than Io's. Although stable satellite orbits at this system are known to be < 15.3 hours, several high-resolution alkali Doppler shift observations are required to constrain a putative orbit. Due to the Roche limit interior to the planetary photosphere at ~ 8 hours, atmosphere-exosphere interactions are expected to be especially important at this system.",

Mayorga, Lily Robinthal 13 pages, 12 figures; accepted for publication in the Planetary Science Journal Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Titan, with its thick and hazy atmosphere, is a key world in our solar system for understanding light scattering processes. NASA's Cassini mission monitored Titan between 2004 and 2017, where the derived dataset includes a large number of whole disk observations. Once spatially integrated, these whole disk observations reveal Titan's phase-dependent brightness which can serve as an analog for how hazy worlds might appear around other stars. To explore Titan's phase curve, we present a pipeline for whole disk Titan observations acquired by the Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) spanning 0.9--5.1 $\\mu$m. Application of the pipeline finds over 4,400 quality spatially- and spectrally-resolved datacubes that were then integrated over Titan's disk to yield phase curves spanning 2\\degree--165\\degree in phase angle. Spectra at near-full phase provide a useful approximation for Titan's geometric albedo, thus extending the spectral coverage of previous work. Crescent phase brightness enhancements in the Cassini VIMS phase curves are often more extreme than analogous results seen at optical wavelengths, which can be explained by atmospheric transparency and haze scattering processes. These results provide validation opportunities for exoplanet-focused spectral models and also shed light on how extreme aerosol forward scattering could influence exoplanet observations and interpretations.",
