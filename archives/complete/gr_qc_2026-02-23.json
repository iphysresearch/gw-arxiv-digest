      "abstract": "Fan-Wang type regular black holes in Quasi-Topological Gravity Ren Tsuda, Ryotaku Suzuki, Shinya Tomizawa General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We construct a class of regular black hole solutions of the Fan-Wang type within quasi-topological gravity (QTG) in arbitrary spacetime dimensions greater than four. In contrast to the original Fan-Wang solution, which was obtained in four-dimensional general relativity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics, our higher-dimensional generalization does not require any matter fields. Instead, regularity is achieved purely through an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections. We demonstrate that the Fan-Wang-type metric is a solution to the QTG field equations by explicitly determining the corresponding coupling constants for each curvature order. Within an appropriate parameter regime, the solution describes an asymptotically flat black hole spacetime with a regular center. Remarkably, even in the case of negative mass, the geometry can remain completely regular, in sharp contrast to Einstein gravity.",

Sahoo General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We study the late-time cosmological dynamics of a spatially flat FLRW universe in the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity, where $Q$ denotes the nonmetricity scalar. The matter sector is modeled as a bulk viscous fluid with a free equation-of-state parameter $\\gamma$, allowing for a generalized description of cosmic matter beyond the standard dust approximation. We derive the background evolution equations and analyze the resulting expansion history. The model parameters are constrained using a combination of observational datasets, including cosmic chronometers (CC), baryon acoustic oscillations from DESI DR2, and Type~Ia supernovae (GRBs and Union3). Using the best-fit parameters, we further employ the statefinder and $\\mathrm{Om}(z)$ diagnostics to distinguish the viscous $f(Q)$ scenario from the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model. In addition, we examine the evolution of the deceleration parameter, which exhibits a transition from an early decelerated phase to the current accelerated expansion, and analyze the effective equation of state behavior. Our results show that bulk viscosity within $f(Q)$ gravity provides a viable and observationally consistent description of late-time cosmic acceleration.",

We show that a subset of these non-polynomial gravities, referred to as non-polynomial quasi-topological gravities, admit single-function static spherically symmetric solutions whereby the metric function is determined by an algebraic equation.

Two analytic models are analyzed, allowing a systematic study of circular geodesics, photon-sphere properties, shadow radius, Lyapunov exponent, ISCO frequency, binding energy, and Hawking temperature. The corrected numerical results show that the halo scale parameter can significantly modify strong-field observables. In both models, for moderate density slopes, increasing the halo parameter reduces characteristic radii while enhancing orbital instability and accretion efficiency. For steeper density falloff, however, deviations from the Schwarzschild case remain small. These results demonstrate that halo-induced modifications of optical and dynamical black hole signatures are strongly controlled by the density profile parameters.",

A ``law'' in theoretical physics is said to be observable or empirical only if it can be verified/falsified by some experimental procedure. The notion of empiricality/observability becomes far more unclear in QFTCS, than in QFT in Minkowski (flat) spacetime (QFTM), mainly because QFTCS lacks the notion of vacuum. This could potentially undermine the status of QFTCS as a physical (not only mathematical) theory. We consider this problem for the Majorana field in curved spacetime, and examine some examples of the empirical laws.",

      "abstract": "Black-Hole mimickers in GR and $f(R)$ gravity Hodek M. García, Marcelo Salgado General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Black hole mimickers (BHMs) are horizonless globally regular ultracompact relativistic self-gravitating objects (UCOs) of mass $M$ and radius $R$ with compactness $C = M/R$ higher than that of a neutron star and that produce an effective potential for null geodesics (photons) that possesses a local maximum, which is usually accompanied by an inner local minimum. The presence of a local maximum allows for unstable circular orbits to exist similar to light rings present in actual BH solutions, while it has been conjectured that the presence of a local minimum is symptomatic of potential instabilities. One such candidate for a BHM is a solitonic boson star (SBS) which is a boson star endowed with a sextic potential. In this paper we investigate further solutions of static and spherically symmetric SBSs in general relativity with a larger set of parameter values, and argue that such solutions are very similar to UCOs composed of an incompressible perfect fluid (IPF) with a sufficiently large pressure (the mimicker of a BHM). These IPFUCOs reach the Buchdahl limit $C= 4/9$ for arbitrarily large pressures. We investigate the extent to which the IPFUCOs constructed within a quadratic model in $f(R)$ gravity can overcome this limit or not, and thus pave the way for possibly building SBSs (or other kind of UCO) within this (or other alternative theory of gravity). We further elaborate about the stability properties of SBSs which have been the subject of some controversy recently.",

González, Eleftherios Papantonopoulos, Yerko Vásquez General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We study the propagation of massive scalar fields in the background of asymptotically flat regular black holes supported by a phantom scalar field with a scalar charge $A$. This parameter regularizes the geometry by removing the central singularity. Focusing on wave dynamics, we analyze scalar perturbations, quasinormal modes, and greybody factors, emphasizing the role of the regularization parameter on the effective potential and the decay properties of the modes. Using WKB methods beyond the eikonal limit, we show that the presence of scalar hair modifies both the oscillation frequencies and damping rates of quasinormal modes. In particular, we demonstrate the occurrence of an anomalous decay rate for massive scalar perturbations: above a critical field mass, the longest-lived modes correspond to lower angular momentum, in contrast with the massless case. We derive analytical expressions for the critical mass and study its dependence on the scalar charge and overtone number. Furthermore, we apply the Horowitz-Hubeny method to compute the quasinormal frequencies and show that the results obtained from the WKB and Horowitz-Hubeny approaches exhibit excellent agreement in the regime where both methods are valid. In addition, we compute reflection and transmission coefficients and analyze the corresponding greybody factors, clarifying how regularity effects imprint themselves on black-hole scattering properties. Our results show that regular black holes with scalar hair exhibit distinctive dynamical signatures that can be probed through quasinormal ringing and wave propagation.",

Villanueva, Ian Vega General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The inspiral of a compact object into a black hole is a key source of low-frequency gravitational waves for future space-based detectors like LISA. While models of this process have advanced, they typically focus on asymptotically flat spacetimes. In this paper, we explore how the absence of asymptotic flatness affects the slow, adiabatic orbital evolution due to radiation reaction. This lack of asymptotic flatness can arise from external environments or an expanding universe. Using the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, where the deviation from flatness is governed by the cosmological constant, we study bound orbits characterized by their semi-latus rectum $p$ and eccentricity $e$. We calculate how the cosmological constant shifts the separatrix between bound and plunging orbits and alters the relationship between the binary's binding energy, angular momentum, and orbital parameters. Assuming the orbital timescale is much shorter than the inspiral timescale, we apply a modified quadrupole formula to examine the impact of a small positive cosmological constant on the orbital evolution in the weak-field limit. We find that the cosmological constant accelerates the decrease in eccentricity, reducing inspiral plunge times, which could influence event rate estimates for space-based detectors.",

      "abstract": "Uncovering subdominant multipole asymmetries in binary black-hole mergers Jannik Mielke, Angela Borchers, Frank Ohme General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In dynamically formed binaries, the spins of the black holes tend to be misaligned with the system's orbital angular momentum. This causes the spins to precess and leads to an asymmetric emission of gravitational waves. The resulting gravitational-wave multipole asymmetries directly source the recoil of the remnant black hole and are the critical element in fully describing precession. Recoil and precession are of significant astrophysical importance, but multipole asymmetries contribute only minimally to the overall signal strength. Consequently, most current gravitational-wave models either do not incorporate asymmetries at all, or only consider the dominant ones. Here we highlight the importance of subdominant multipole asymmetries for an accurate recoil velocity calculation and discuss their detectability with third generation detectors. Neglecting subdominant asymmetries leads to velocity differences of up to 210 km/s and can, in particular, introduce systematic biases in the inference of masses and the spin geometry. We further discuss universal characteristics of subdominant multipole asymmetries in order to prepare the ground for potential future asymmetry models. In the inspiral regime, the average antisymmetric frequencies can be described by a multiple of the orbital frequency. During ringdown, however, they become equal to their corresponding symmetric frequencies.",

Motivated by this discrepancy, we investigate the inflationary predictions of the $\\beta$-exponential potential, $V(\\phi)=V_0\\left(1-\\lambda\\beta\\phi/M_p\\right)^{1/\\beta}$ considering both minimally and non-minimally coupled realizations. This potential generalizes standard exponential inflation and naturally arises in braneworld scenarios. We derive analytical expressions for the slow-roll parameters and inflationary observables using a perturbative expansion in the non-minimal coupling $\\xi$, and validate these results through numerical calculations. In the minimally coupled case, the model predicts $n_s \\simeq 0.976$ and $r \\simeq 0.035$ for $N=50$ and moderate values of \\beta, remaining compatible with ACT+DESI constraints at the 1\\sigma level while yielding a spectral tilt larger than the universal attractor prediction. Introducing a small non-minimal coupling significantly improves agreement with observations by suppressing the tensor-to-scalar ratio while preserving the enhanced scalar tilt. For $N=60, \\lambda \\sim 0.3-0.5$, and $\\beta \\sim O(1-5)$, the non-minimally coupled model yields $n_s \\simeq 0.974-0.976$ and $r \\lesssim 0.03$, comfortably consistent with ACT, DESI, and BICEP/Keck bounds. Our results show that the $\\beta$-exponential potential, especially when implemented with a non-minimal coupling, exhibits good agreement with the latest CMB observations. Our inflationary predictions of the non-minimal model of $n_s$ and $r$ confirming the leading-order contributions in $\\xi$ are sufficient to capture the essential features of both $r$ and $n_s$ in observationally relevant regimes.",

Newton Singh, B.Mishra General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We investigate white dwarfs in the framework of f(R,L_m) and f(R,L_m,T) gravity to explore the Chandrasekhar Limit. We have considered two functional forms of f(R,L_m) and one functional form of f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Considering the matter Lagrangian L_m=p, we calculate modified TOV equations for each of the forms. By employing the fully degenerate electron gas equation of state in the modified TOV equations, we derive the mass-radius relation for each functional form of both f(R,L_m) and f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Our models imply modifications in the Chandrasekhar mass limit that deviate significantly from the GR and the Newtonian cases. In the f(R,L_m, T)$ gravity, the new mass limit of the white dwarf can reach upto 1.537\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot while in f(R,L_m) with the quadratic extension can goes upto 1.52\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot and with exponential extension upto 2.08\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot.

We also calculate compactness and gravitational redshift, which are much lower than those of neutron stars and black holes. Stability is also confirmed by adiabatic indices, which show that all models yield \\Gamma > 4/3 throughout the interiors of WDs. Overall, our models provide a viable framework for the existence of super-Chandrasekhar mass limit, extending beyond the classical predictions in the Newtonian and/or GR cases.",

In this work, we test the robustness of parameterized tests against unmodeled deviations from general relativity. We demonstrate that these parameterized tests are flexible and sensitive in detecting generic deviations in the waveform using the Cutler-Vallisneri bias formalism. This universality arises from examining the inherent geometry of the waveform signal and understanding how biases manifest. We show how Bayes factors are governed by the intrinsic geometry of the waveform signal manifold when parameterized tests are used to approximate generic violations of GR. We use the singular value decomposition to propose templates that are orthogonal to parameterized tests, identifying degeneracies and enhancing the detection of potential deviations. More broadly, the geometric framework developed here clarifies -- at a fundamental level -- how subtle waveform effects (including orbital eccentricity, spin precession, waveform systematics, and instrumental glitches) can mimic one another in data, and when they are intrinsically distinguishable.",

Starting from accelerating Bertotti--Robinson black holes, we employ two independent mechanisms: a Melvin--Bonnor-type magnetization and an Inversion symmetry of the Einstein--Maxwell system. In both cases the external electromagnetic field can be removed, while a non-trivial gravitational backreaction remains in the metric, yielding new accelerating vacuum spacetimes of Petrov type I. In the static, non-accelerating limit, the magnetized Schwarzschild case reproduces previously known results, whereas the Inversion symmetry leads to a genuinely new vacuum configuration. These findings provide a method for generating algebraically general vacuum geometries and illustrate how electromagnetic embeddings can produce non-trivial vacuum metrics in General Relativity. The main geometrical properties of these spacetimes are discussed. Two additional results are presented in the appendices: a stationary generalization of these vacuum geometries, and two further static vacuum configurations obtained through the same symmetries but using the Alekseev--García black hole as the seed.",

We show that $\\beta^\\mu$ can be reconstructed directly from electromagnetic fluctuations emitted by a drifting medium, without external probes, spectral lines, or absolute intensity calibration. A Lorentz boost converts isotropic rest-frame noise into correlated electric and magnetic fields, producing a gain-independent fluctuation observable that yields the drift velocity purely from stochastic data. Combined with angle-resolved noise spectra governed by the covariant fluctuation--dissipation theorem, this enables full reconstruction of $\\beta^\\mu$ using electromagnetic measurements alone. Monte Carlo analysis demonstrates percent-level accuracy at realistic signal-to-noise ratios, and feasibility estimates indicate sub-microsecond integration times for laboratory plasmas.

Rodriguez, Massimo Bassan, Giuseppe Pucacco, Luciano Anselmo, Graham Appleby, Marco Cinelli, Alessandro Di Marco, Marco Lucente, Carmelo Magnafico, Carmen Pardini, Feliciana Sapio 6 pages, 4 figures, 49 references General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Violations of Lorentz Invariance, a cornerstone of modern physics, are predicted by theories of quantum gravity and by extensions of General Relativity involving new vector or tensor fields. In the weak-field limit, such a violation would primarily manifest as a non-zero value for the post-Newtonian parameter $\\alpha_1$, which is identically zero in General Relativity. We present a new test of Local Lorentz Invariance by searching for this signature in the orbits of the LAGEOS and LAGEOS II satellites. By applying a Phase Sensitive Detection technique to the mean argument of latitude, derived from about 30 years of Satellite Laser Ranging data, we isolate the periodic signal potentially induced by a preferred reference frame aligned with the Cosmic Microwave Background. {Our analysis yields a new constraint $|\\alpha_1| \\sim 2 \\times 10^{-5}$. This result improves upon the previous best limit from Lunar Laser Ranging and provides the most stringent constraint to date on preferred-frame effects in Earth's gravity.}",

C 85, 1432 (2025) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) A novel analytical Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) solution is derived. It exhibits a static BH with a dark matter (DM) halo characterized by a Dehnen-type density profile. This solution could represent an alternative perspective on the interaction of black hole-dark matter systems, providing new insights into the fundamental properties of DM halos. We study the properties of the newly derived BH solution by examining its spacetime curvature characteristics and energy conditions, providing insights into how the DM halo influences these fundamental characteristics. Additionally, we analyze the timelike geodesics of test particles in the obtained BH-DM spacetime, highlighting how the presence of the novel Dehnen-type DM halo alters the gravitational dynamics and modifies particle trajectories. Increase of the DM halo's density $\\rho_s$ and characteristic scale $r_s$ leads to an outward shift of both stable and unstable circular orbits. Finally, we test our model by fitting it to real data from the microquasars GRO J1655-40, GRS 1915+105, and XTE J1550-564 using a statistical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. This allows us to find the best estimates for the properties of the DM halo surrounding these systems.",

D 113, L041503 (2026) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The five-dimensional loop quantum Kaluza-Klein cosmology is constructed based on the symmetric reduction of the connection formulation of the full theory. Through semiclassical analysis, the effective scalar constraint for the cosmological model coupled with a dust field is derived, incorporating the quantum fluctuations of geometry as a subleading order correction. It demonstrates that the quantum model has the correct classical limit. The explicit solutions to the equations of motion show that the big bang and past big rip singularities in the classical model are avoided by a quantum bounce and a quantum collapse respectively in the effective model. In a particular scenario, the dynamical compactification of the extra dimension is realized, while the observable four-dimensional universe transitions through three distinct epochs: (i) a super-inflationary phase generating 55 e-folds, (ii) a decelerated expansion era, and (iii) a late-time accelerated expansion phase driven by quantum fluctuations. These results suggest that both cosmic inflation and dark energy may originate from the interplay between the compact extra dimension and quantum geometric effects.",

Producing the contents of the GWTC from detector data requires complex analysis methods. These comprise techniques to model the signal; identify the transients in the data; evaluate the quality of the data and mitigate possible instrumental issues; infer the parameters of each transient; compare the data with the waveform models for compact binary coalescences; and handle the large amount of results associated with all these different analyses.

WKB counting of trapped near-horizon cavity modes shows that, within the perturbative small-deformation regime studied here, a modest quadrupolar deformation self-regularizes the ultraviolet divergence: the entropy becomes finite without an ad hoc cutoff. Adopting the Hawking temperature and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole of the same mass as external thermodynamic inputs, matching this canonical entropy to that benchmark yields an entropy-motivated deformation scale which, when interpreted phenomenologically in a stationary extension, corresponds to percent-to-tens-of-percent violations of the Kerr multipole relations, and provides concrete observational targets for the Next Generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT), the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), and planned third-generation (3G) ground-based gravitational wave observatories.",

We thus develop a systematic approach connecting such a framework to effective gravitational actions extending general relativity. By examining quantum gravity-motivated corrections to black hole entropy induced by the GUP and employing Wald's formalism, we reconstruct modifications to Einstein's gravity within the contexts of $f(R)$ and $f(R, R_{\\mu\\nu} R^{\\mu\\nu})$ theories. In this way, we establish a direct mapping between the GUP parameters and the higher-order curvature coefficients in the gravitational Lagrangian. As an illustrative application, we compute corrections to the general relativistic prediction for light deflection, which in turn allows us to infer a stringent upper bound on the minimal measurable length. Our results show that GUP-induced effects can be consistently embedded into extended gravity theories, offering a promising framework for testing quantum gravity phenomenology through astrophysical and cosmological observations.",

Green, Kai Lin, Rui-Hong Yue 46 pages, 7 figures, and 10 tables General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this study, we extend Leaver's continued fraction method to evaluate black hole quasinormal modes (QNMs) in systems where the effective potential exhibits a discontinuity. Besides the low-lying modes, we particularly focus on high overtones, which are physically pertinent due to the substantial deformation of the QNM spectrum triggered by spectral instability. In our algorithm, we expand the wavefunction at the point of discontinuity, instead of the black hole horizon, and incorporate the Israel-Lanczos-Sen junction conditions. %As the wavefunction convergence condition becomes irrelevant, our proposed algorithm generalizes the original method by expanding the wavefunctions at the point of discontinuity, and the associated difficulty is mitigated by rectifying the recurrence relations between the expansion coefficients to incorporate the Israel-Lanczos-Sen junction conditions. We apply this algorithm to compute the QNMs of the modified Regge-Wheeler potential up to $2000$ modes with high precision. For the low-lying modes, the numerical results show excellent agreement with those obtained using the matrix and Prony methods. The high overtones are significantly deformed, owing to the presence of echoes due to the discontinuity. This deformation in the asymptotic QNM spectrum reveals universal features that are largely independent of the specific form of the discontinuity in the potential, seemingly coinciding with those observed in the modified Pöschl-Teller effective potential. We speculate on whether the collective effect of the high overtones has an observational impact on gravitational wave signals.",

Appendix added General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Motivated by recent accurate measurements of disk/jet coprecessions around some galactic supermassive black holes, the accelerations experienced by an uncharged, spinless object in the Kerr metric, written in harmonic coordinates, are analytically calculated up to the formal second post-Newtonian order. To such a level, some new accelerations make their appearance. They are proportional to even and odd powers of the hole's angular momentum. Their counterparts are not known where the primary is a material body. After expressing them in a coordinate-independent, vector form valid for any orientations of the hole's spin axis in space, their orbital effects are perturbatively worked out in terms of the particle's Keplerian orbital elements. The resulting expressions, averaged over one orbital revolution, are valid for generic shapes and inclinations of the orbit. The orbital plane's precession proportional to the first power of the hole's angular momentum and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light amounts to about twenty per cent of the corresponding Lense-Thirring effect. The latter is believed to be the cause of the accurately measured disk/jet precessional phenomenology, currently measured to a few per cent accuracy. Although at a lesser extent, also the precession proportional to the second power of the hole's spin and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light is measurable. Allowed domains in the parameter space of the jet precession around M87$^\\ast$ are displayed.",

      "abstract": "What does a regular star look like? Yu Liang, Yuhao Cui, Kai Lin, Sen Guo, V. H. Satheeshkumar, Yang Huang, Yang-Yi Sun, Elcio Abdalla General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Recently, astronomers discovered unusual Einstein cross images of the galaxy HerS-3, which feature a bright central spot. Motivated by studies of images produced by regular stars, it has been proposed that optical appearances caused by compact stars acting as gravitational lenses may account for this central bright spot. We further suggest that images produced by regular stars exhibit additional characteristics distinct from those of ordinary black holes, such as the possible partial or complete absence of secondary images. These phenomena may serve as favorable observational criteria for identifying regular stars in future searches.",
