      "abstract": "Turbulent Dynamo Action in Binary Neutron Star Mergers Eduardo M. Gutiérrez, David Radice, Jacob Fields, James M. Stone High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Binary neutron star mergers are expected to generate intense magnetic fields that power relativistic and non-relativistic outflows and shape their multimessenger signatures. These fields likely arise from the turbulent amplification of initially weak magnetic fields during the merger, particularly via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the collisional interface between the stars. While previous studies have shown efficient amplification to magnetar-level strengths, the degree of large-scale coherence of the resulting field remains uncertain. We present general-relativistic, dynamical spacetime, magnetohydrodynamic simulations following the evolution of initially weak, pulsar-like magnetic fields in a binary neutron star merger. We find rapid magnetic field growth at small scales with clear signatures of small-scale turbulent dynamo action. At the highest resolutions, we additionally observe the emergence of coherent magnetic structures on larger scales. Our results imply that strong, ordered magnetic fields may be present immediately after merger, with important implications for the subsequent evolution of the remnant and its observable electromagnetic and gravitational-wave signals.",

While the microphysical details may differ, as long as these sources are bounded in duration and correlation length, their tensor power spectra exhibit a universal scaling behavior at small wavenumber: $P_h(k) \\propto k^3$, corresponding to white noise on super-horizon scales at the time of production. If these early causal tensor sources (ECTs) exclusively produce gravitational waves before redshift $z \\sim 10^5$, this scaling is realized on all of the scales observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and thus yields a universal multipole distribution for the $B$-mode angular power spectrum. Unlike the scale-invariant distributions of inflationary $B$ modes, ECTs generically predict enhanced power on small scales and suppressed power on large scales, which allows these source classes to be distinguished given measurements over a sufficient range of angular scales. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for characterizing ECTs and demonstrate how their universal infrared scaling manifests in low-frequency observables, including CMB $B$ modes and stochastic gravitational wave spectral densities. We illustrate this mapping with representative case studies of this universality class involving first-order phase transitions, topological defects, and enhanced scalar perturbations, which source tensor modes at second order in perturbation theory.",

This particular form of EoS was first proposed by S. Saha and K. Bamba in 2019 and has two parameters, $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$, which must be determined from observations. To this end, we place limits on these parameters by combining recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data -- including measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) -- with Type Ia supernova observations from the Pantheon+ compilation, along with direct determinations of the Hubble parameter. From this combined analysis, we obtain a best-fit value for the Hubble parameter, $H_0 = 67.4 \\pm 1.2~\\text{km\\,s}^{-1}\\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, while current measurements of the sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch yield $r_d = 146\\pm 2.5$~Mpc. Furthermore, we study the evolution of the deceleration parameter, the effective EoS, and the jerk parameter, and support our findings using the $Om(z)$ diagnostic. The model exhibits noticeable deviations from the predictions of the concordance $\\Lambda$CDM model. Despite these differences, our results indicate that the model provides a coherent description of late-time cosmic evolution and the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe. Finally, we assess the observational viability of the model using information criteria, particularly the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and compare these results with those obtained for the $\\Lambda$CDM model, which serves as our reference.",

In such scenarios, however, a phantom-divide crossing, as recently suggested by DESI observations, is not achieved without encountering theoretical inconsistencies. We incorporate a canonical scalar field with a potential, in addition to the vector field, and show that the phantom-divide crossing from $w_{\\rm DE} < -1$ to $w_{\\rm DE} > -1$ can occur at low redshifts. We propose a minimal model that admits such a transition and identify the region of parameter space in which all dynamical degrees of freedom in the scalar, vector, and tensor sectors are free from ghost and Laplacian instabilities. We further investigate the evolution of linear cosmological perturbations by applying the quasi-static approximation to modes well inside the Hubble radius. The dimensionless quantities $\\mu$ and $\\Sigma$, which characterize the growth of matter perturbations and the bending of light rays, respectively, depend on the sound speed $c_\\psi$ of the longitudinal scalar perturbation associated with the vector field. Since $c_\\psi$ is influenced by the transverse vector mode, the model exhibits sufficient flexibility to yield values of $\\mu$ and $\\Sigma$ close to 1. Consequently, unlike theories such as scalar Galileons, the present model can be consistent with observations of redshift-space distortions and integrated Sachs-Wolfe-galaxy cross-correlations.",

Gaia DR3 provides precise measurements of the four sky-plane components of the 3D relative displacement and velocity ($\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{v}$) for a wide binary, but not comparably precise line-of-sight (radial) separation and relative velocity $v_{r}$. Based on our new observations and the public databases/publications, we assemble a sample of 36 nearby (distance $<150$pc) wide binaries in the low-acceleration regime with accurate values of $v_{r}$ (uncertainty $< 100$ m\\,s$^{-1}$). Kinematic contaminants such as undetected stellar companions are well under control using various observational diagnostics such as Gaia's ruwe parameter, the color-magnitude diagram, multi-epoch observations of radial velocities, Speckle interferometric follow-up observations, and requiring Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion consistency. For the parameter $\\Gamma \\equiv \\log_{10}\\sqrt{\\gamma}$ with $\\gamma \\equiv G/G_{\\rm N}$ (where $G$ is a parameter generalizing Newton's constant $G_{\\rm N}$ in elliptical orbits), we find $\\Gamma=0.102_{-0.021}^{+0.023}$, inconsistent with standard gravity at $4.9\\sigma$, giving a gravity boost factor of $\\gamma=1.600_{-0.141}^{+0.171}$. Four wide binaries have 3D relative velocities exceeding their estimated Newtonian escape velocities with $1<v_{\\rm obs}/v_{\\rm escN}\\le1.2$. These systems are unlikely to be chance associations and are expected in a nonstandard paradigm such as Milgromian dynamics (MOND). The hypothesis that Newtonian gravity can be extrapolated to the low-acceleration limit is falsified by this independent study with accurate 3D velocities. Future radial velocity monitoring and Speckle interferometric imaging for larger samples will be useful to refine the present result.",

Saridakis Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The origin of the Hubble tension remains one of the central open problems in modern cosmology, with competing explanations invoking either early-Universe physics, late-time modifications of cosmic expansion, or unresolved observational systematics. In this Letter we propose a new, purely geometric null test of the late-time expansion history that is exactly independent of the Hubble constant. By combining strong-lensing time-delay distances with gravitational-wave standard-siren luminosity distances, we construct a dimensionless ratio that depends only on the redshift dependence of the expansion rate and can be both predicted from early-Universe data and measured directly at late times, without relying on the cosmic distance ladder or the sound horizon. We show that the comparison between the early- and late-time determinations of this ratio provides a transparent consistency test of the standard cosmological expansion. When combined with an independent standard-siren measurement of $H_{0}$, this framework allows one to unambiguously distinguish between early- and late-time origins of the Hubble tension. With the forthcoming detection of lensed gravitational-wave standard sirens, the proposed test provides a timely and robust framework for probing this long-standing cosmological puzzle.",

We demonstrate that a lunar-based laser interferometer, such as the proposed Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA), can directly probe the sound speed of dark energy by measuring the real-time evolution of horizon-scale gravitational potentials. Operating in the ultra-low-frequency gravitational band inaccessible from Earth, LILA is sensitive to scalar metric perturbations sourced by dark energy dynamics. Using both fluid and effective field theory descriptions, we develop a complete framework linking dark energy sound speed to observable strain signatures. We construct a likelihood pipeline and Fisher forecasts, showing that LILA can either detect clustering dark energy or exclude broad classes of models with unprecedented sensitivity.

We examine the situation for a broad interval of EoS parameter that remains most favourable to explain the recent data released by the pulsar timing array (PTA) collaboration. Our analysis yields the interval, $0.2 \\leq w \\leq 1/3$, to be the most acceptable window from the SIGW interpretation of the PTA signal and where sizeable PBHs abundance, $f_{\\rm PBH} \\in (10^{-3},1)$, is observed. We also obtain $w=1/3$, radiation-dominated era, to be the best scenario to explain the early stages of the Universe and address the overproduction problem. Within the range of $1 \\leq c_{s} \\leq 1.17$, we construct a regularized-renormalized-resummed scalar power spectrum whose amplitude obeys the perturbativity criterion while being substantial enough to generate EoS dependent scalar induced gravitational waves ($w$-SIGWs) consistent with NANOGrav-15 data.

Our focus is mainly on the analysis of convective stability and mode characteristics of the massive NSs. We derive stability criteria for hot, differentially rotating relativistic stars that account for both buoyant and rotational restoring forces, and apply them for the first time to the post-merger massive NSs. Our results show no evidence of large-scale convective instability, as both angle-averaged specific entropy and specific angular momentum increase outward within the massive NSs. Rotational effects significantly enhance stability for local regions that would be otherwise unstable by the Schwarzschild criterion. Additionally, our mode analysis of matter fields and gravitational waves reveals no excitation of observable inertial modes after the damping of quadrupolar $f$-modes in the massive NSs, contrasting with previous studies. As in many previous works, we observe the excitation of an $m=1$ one-armed mode. However, we also find that the growth of the $m=1$ mode amplitude after the merger may correlate strongly with the violation of linear momentum conservation, indicating that we cannot reject the possibility that the excitation of the one-armed mode has a numerical origin.",

However, this Gaussianity assumption may break down for certain classes of astrophysical and cosmological signals, particularly for a gravitational wave background (GWB) generated by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). In this work, we present a new method for testing the presence of non-Gaussian features in PTA data. We go beyond the Gaussian assumption by modeling the noise or signal statistics using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). An advantage of this approach is that the marginalization of the likelihood remains fully analytical, expressed as a linear combination of Gaussian PTA likelihoods. This makes the method straightforward to implement within existing data analysis tools. Moreover, this method extends beyond the free spectrum analysis by producing posterior probability distributions of higher-order moments inferred from the data, which can be incorporated into spectral refitting techniques. We validate the model using simulations and demonstrate the sensitivity of PTAs to non-Gaussianity by computing the Bayes factor in favor of the GMM as a function of the injected excess moments. We apply the method to a more astrophysically motivated scenario where a single SMBHB is resolved on top of a Gaussian GWB and show that significant non-Gaussianities are introduced by the individual source. Finally, we test our model on a realistic GWB generated from a simulated population of SMBHBs.",

D, for associated derivation of the master equations, see this https URL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th) Dynamical tides of neutron stars in the late stages of binary inspirals provide a viable probe into dense matter through gravitational waves, and potentially trigger electromagnetic precursors. We model the tidal response as a set of driven harmonic oscillators, where the natural frequencies are given by the quasinormal modes of a nonrotating neutron star. These modes are calculated in general relativity by applying linear perturbation theory to stellar models that include a solid crust and compositional stratification. For the mode spectrum, we find that the canonical interface mode associated with the crust-core boundary vanishes in stratified neutron stars and is replaced by compositional gravity modes with mixed gravity-interfacial character, driven primarily by strong buoyancy in the outer core. We also find that fluid modes such as the core gravity mode and the fundamental mode can penetrate the crust, and we establish a criterion for such penetration. Regarding the tidal interaction, we find that transfer of binding energy to oscillations is dominated by the fundamental mode despite its frequency being too high to resonate with the tidal forcing. In general, we find that lower-frequency modes induce gravitational-wave phase shifts smaller than $\\sim 10^{-3},\\rm rad$ for the equation of state we consider. We discover that nonresonant fundamental and crustal shear modes can trigger crust breaking already near the first gravity-mode resonance, while gravity-mode resonance concentrates strain at the base of the crust and may marginally crack it. These results suggest that both resonant and nonresonant excitations can overstress the crust and may channel energy into the magnetosphere prior to merger, potentially powering electromagnetic precursors. Our work represents an important step toward realistic modeling of dynamical tides of neutron stars in multimessenger observations.",

We investigate the possible redshift evolution of dark energy and the Hubble constant through a data-driven approach, and assess whether such evolution can alleviate the Hubble constant tension. We perform a model-independent reconstruction of the dark-energy equation of state $w(z)$, jointly with an evolving Hubble constant $H_0(z)$. The analysis combines the DESI DR2 BAO dataset with multiple Type Ia supernova samples and evaluates the statistical preference for the reconstructed model using Bayesian evidence. The reconstructed $w(z)$ varies with redshift and exhibits two potential phantom crossings at $z\\sim0.5$ and $z\\sim1.5$. Meanwhile, $H_0$ decreases continually from local to high redshift, alleviating the Hubble constant tension effectively. The joint $w(z)$-$H_0(z)$ model is favored over the $w$CDM ($\\Lambda$CDM) framework, with a logarithmic Bayes factor $\\ln \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal B}= 5.04~(8.53)$. The results remain stable under different prior choices and dataset combinations. Our data-driven reconstructions suggest redshift evolution in both $w(z)$ and $H_0(z)$, offering a potential route to mitigate the Hubble constant tension. Future BAO measurements from Euclid and next-generation CMB experiments will provide critical tests of these results and bring deeper insights into the nature of dark energy and the evolution of cosmic expansion.",

Here, we show that the expression for the cross-correlation is derived efficiently with the total-angular-momentum formalism and use this framework to extend the formulation to cross-correlation with astrometry.

Bouchet Submitted to PRL, 7 pages, 5 figures Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Non-inflationary sources of gravitational waves in the early Universe generically predict causality-limited tensor power spectra at low frequencies. We report the first-ever constraints on such sources based on cosmic microwave background (CMB) $B$-mode polarization measurements. Using data from BICEP/Keck, SPTpol, SPT-3G, Planck, and WMAP, we constrain the amplitude of an early causal tensor (ECT) power spectrum parameterized by $r_{ect}$, the ratio of causal tensor power to total scalar power at $k~=~0.01$ Mpc$^{-1}$, and obtain a 95% CL upper limit of $r_{ect}<$ 0.0077. Since $r_{ect}$ can easily be related to the parameters of a given theory, our bound robustly constrains a broad class of well-motivated gravitational wave sources in the early universe, including first-order cosmological phase transitions, enhanced small-scale density perturbations, and various topological defects. Finally, we translate our limit into a bound on the present-day energy density in gravitational waves at ultra-low frequencies otherwise inaccessible to traditional gravitational wave detection strategies, including pulsar timing arrays, interferometers, and resonant cavities.",

Pedersen Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The extragalactic background light (EBL) fluctuations in the optical/near-IR encode the cumulative integrated galaxy light (IGL), diffuse intra-halo light (IHL), and high-$z$ sources from the epoch of reionisation (EoR), but they are difficult to disentangle with auto-spectra alone. We aim to decompose the EBL into its principal constituents using multi-band intensity mapping combined with cosmic shear and galaxy clustering. We develop a joint halo-model framework in which IHL follows a mass- and redshift-dependent luminosity scaling, IGL is set by an evolving Schechter luminosity function, and EoR emission is modelled with Pop II/III stellar emissivities and a binned star-formation efficiency. Using mock surveys in a flat $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology with ten spectral bands spanning 0.75-5.0$\\rm \\mu m$ in the NEP deep fields over about 100$°^2$ with source detections down to AB=20.5 for masking, and six redshift bins to $z=2.5$, we fit auto- and cross-power spectra using a MCMC method. The combined SPHEREx$\\times$Euclid analysis recovers all fiducial parameters within 1$\\sigma$ and reduces 1$\\sigma$ uncertainties on IHL parameters by 10-35% relative to SPHEREx EBL-only, while EoR star-formation efficiency parameters improve by 20-35%. Cross-correlations reveal a stronger coupling of IHL than IGL to the shear field, enhancing component separation; conversely, the EoR contribution shows negligible correlation with cosmic shear and galaxy clustering, aiding its isolation in the EBL. Relative to the SPHEREx EBL-only case, the inferred IHL fraction as a function of halo mass is significantly tightened over $10^{11}-10^{14} M_{\\odot}$, with uncertainties reduced by 5-30%, and the resulting star-formation rate density constraints extend to $z\\sim 11$, with uncertainty reductions of 22-31%.",

To achieve this, we augment the existing dataset by adding redshift data from our deep MMT/Hectospec survey and from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), significantly improving the spectroscopic completeness down to $r_{\\mathrm{petro},0} = 20.8$ within the central $30^\\prime$ region. The resulting luminosity function is well described by a Schechter function with a characteristic magnitude $M^* = -21.30 \\pm 0.27$ and a faint-end slope $\\alpha = -1.23 \\pm 0.05$. This faint-end slope is consistent with those measured in the nearby Coma and Virgo clusters and in a cluster from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, and is slightly shallower than that of field galaxies. These findings indicate that the previously claimed steep faint-end upturn (with $\\alpha \\sim -2$) in nearby galaxy clusters is not supported. Instead, they indicate that environmental processes in dense cluster cores does not seem to trigger the formation or survival of low-mass galaxies, thereby preventing a steep faint-end upturn in the luminosity function.",

The cross-correlation signal is measured as a function of the comoving separation $R$ between 2MASS galaxies and background FRB sightlines, making full use of the available redshift information for both datasets. Our measurements are consistent with a null detection over the range $0.01 < R\\, [h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}] < 1$. Using a halo-based model in which free-electron density profiles are drawn from the hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG-300 (TNG300), we show that the null signal at $R \\sim 0.01\\, h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$ is inconsistent with the TNG300 prediction. This discrepancy indicates that the hot-gas mass fraction in halos with masses of $10^{12-13}\\, M_\\odot$ hosting 2MASS galaxies must be lower than that predicted by TNG300. A simple phenomenological modification of the TNG300 model suggests that the hot-gas mass fraction in halos of $10^{12-13}\\, M_\\odot$ should be below $\\sim 10\\%$ of the global baryon fraction in the nearby universe, implying the need for stronger feedback in this mass range. Our constraints are consistent with those inferred from X-ray emission and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements in galaxies, while providing a direct estimate of the hot-gas mass fraction that does not rely on electron-temperature measurements. These results demonstrate that galaxy-FRB cross correlations offer a powerful probe of feedback processes in galaxy formation.",

We capture the dependence of the signal on cosmology and intergalactic medium physics using an emulator trained on a cosmological suite of hydrodynamical simulations, and we correct its predictions for the impact of astrophysical contaminants and systematics, many of these not considered in previous analyses. We employ this framework to constrain the amplitude and logarithmic slope of the linear matter power spectrum at $k_\\star=0.009\\,\\mathrm{km^{-1}s}$ and redshift $z=3$, obtaining $\\Delta^2_\\star=0.379\\pm0.032$ and $n_\\star=-2.309\\pm0.019$. The robustness of these constraints is validated through the analysis of mocks and a large number of alternative data analysis variations, with cosmological parameters kept blinded throughout the validation process. We then combine our results with constraints from DESI BAO and temperature, polarization, and lensing measurements from Planck, ACT, and SPT-3G to set constraints on $\\Lambda$CDM extensions. While our measurements do not significantly tighten the limits on the sum of neutrino masses from the combination of these probes, they sharpen the constraints on the effective number of relativistic species, $N_\\mathrm{eff}=3.02\\pm0.10$, the running of the spectral index, $\\alpha_\\mathrm{s}=0.0014\\pm0.0041$, and the running of the running, $\\beta_\\mathrm{s}=-0.0006\\pm0.0048$, by a factor of 1.18, 1.27, and 1.90, respectively. We conclude by outlining the improvements needed to fully reach the level of confidence implied by these uncertainties.",

      "abstract": "Forecasting Constraints on Cosmology and Modified Gravitational-wave Propagation by Strongly Lensed Gravitational Waves Associating with Galaxy Surveys Anson Chen, Jun Zhang Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Gravitational lensing of gravitational wave (GW) will become the next frontier in studying cosmology and gravity. While time-delay cosmography using quadruply lensed GW events associated with optical images of the lens systems can provide precise measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), they are considered to be much rarer than doubly lensed events. In this work, we analyze time-delay cosmography with doubly lensed GW events for the first time. We generate mock doubly lensed GW events with designed sensitivity of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O5 network, with LIGO post-O5 upgrade, and with Einstein Telescope (ET) + Cosmic Explorer (CE) respectively, and select the events that can be associated with future galaxy surveys. Over 1000 realizations, we find an average of 0.2(2.4) qualified events with the LVK O5(post-O5) network. Whereas with the ET+CE network, we find an average of 73.2 qualified events over 100 realizations. Using the Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS) lens model, we jointly estimate waveform parameters and the impact parameter with doubly lensed GW signals, and then forecast the constraints on cosmological parameters and modified GW propagation by combining time-delay cosmography and the standard siren approach. The average posterior gives a constraint on $H_0$ with a relative uncertainty of $14\\%$, $10\\%$ and $0.42\\%$ in the $\\Lambda$CDM model for the LVK O5, LVK post-O5, and ET+CE network, respectively. While the LVK network gives uninformative constraints on the $(w_0,w_a)$ dynamical dark energy model, the ET+CE network yields a moderate constraint of $w_0=-1.02^{+0.31}_{-0.22}$ and $w_a=0.48^{+0.99}_{-1.54}$. In addition, our method can provide precise constraints on modified GW propagation effects jointly with $H_0$.",

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The central engines of Little Red Dots (LRDs) may be ``black hole stars\" (BH*s), early stages of black hole growth characterized by dense gas envelopes. So far, the most direct evidence for BH*s comes from a handful of sources where the host galaxy is completely outshone as suggested by their remarkably steep Balmer breaks. Here we present a novel scheme to disentangle BH*s from their host galaxies assuming that the [OIII]5008Å line arises exclusively from the host. Using a sample of 98 LRDs ($z$~$2-9$) with high quality NIRSpec/PRISM spectra, we demonstrate that the host-subtracted median stack displays a Balmer break $>2\\times$ stronger than massive quiescent galaxies, with the rest-optical continuum resembling a blackbody-like SED ($T_{\\rm{eff}}$~$4050$ K, $\\log(L_{\\rm{bol}})$~$43.9$ erg s$^{-1}$, $R_{\\rm{eff}}$~$1300$ au). We measure a steep Balmer decrement (H$\\alpha$/H$\\beta>10$) and numerous density-sensitive features (e.g., FeII, HeI, OI). These are hallmark signatures of dense gas envelopes, providing population-level evidence that BH*s indeed power LRDs. In the median LRD, BH*s account for $\\sim20\\%$ of the UV emission, $\\sim50\\%$ at the Balmer break, and $\\sim90\\%$ at wavelengths longer than H$\\alpha$ with the remainder arising from the host. BH*s preferentially reside in low-mass galaxies ($M_{\\rm{\\star}}$~$10^{8}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\rm{\\odot}}$) undergoing recent starbursts, as evidenced by extreme emission line EWs (e.g., [OIII]5008Å~$1100$Å, CIII]~$12$Å), thereby favoring BH* origins linked to star-formation. We show V-shaped LRD selections are biased to high BH*/host fractions ($\\gtrsim60\\%$ at 5500Å) -- less dominant BH*s may be powering JWST's blue broad-line AGN. We find BH*s are so commonplace and transient (duty cycle $\\sim1\\%$, lifetime $\\sim10$ Myrs) that every massive black hole may have once shone as a BH*.",

      "abstract": "Towards precision astrometry of scattered images of compact radio sources: scintillometry theory and prospects Dylan L. Jow, Delon Shen High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Compact radio sources such as pulsars and FRBs undergo scintillation in the interstellar medium (ISM) when scattered images interfere at the observer. ``Scintillometry'' refers to the range of techniques to extract astrometric information -- such as the angular positions of the images and distances to the scattering screen and source -- from scintillation observations. Pulsar scintillometry has proven to be a powerful technique, revealing rich and unexpected scattering phenomenology in the ISM and also shedding light on the emission physics of pulsars. FRB scintillometry stands to be a similarly powerful probe of FRB emission, as well as structure on tiny scales in ionized media beyond our galaxy, such as the circumgalactic medium (CGM). However, nascent FRB scintillation studies are far from the sophisticated lensing geometry reconstructions that have been performed for scintillating pulsars. In this paper, we introduce a novel theoretical framework for scintillometry, demonstrating that the full astrometric content of scintillation observations is contained within a single underlying observable: the instantaneous spatial wavefield. We relate the instantaneous spatial wavefield to more familiar concepts from the pulsar scintillometry literature, such as the dynamic spectrum. Using this framework, we discuss prospects and limitations for FRB scintillometry, towards the goal of full astrometric reconstructions of FRB lensing geometries. We show how key degeneracies in two-screen scattering measurements can be ameliorated. In addition, we discuss the possibility of inferring dispersion measure gradients across scintillation screens, which may shed light on the highly unconstrained physics of the cool CGM phase on tiny ($\\sim 100\\,{\\rm au}$) scales.",

We derive PBH mass distributions using Press--Schechter theory completed by the excursion-set first-crossing construction. We define the smoothed density contrast $\\delta_R$ and its variance $S(R)=\\sigma^2(R)$, and connect $S$ to the primordial curvature spectrum $\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathcal R}(k)$ through the radiation-era transfer. For Gaussian statistics and a constant collapse threshold $\\delta_c$, the formation fraction is an $\\operatorname{erfc}$ tail with a controlled rare-event asymptotic.

Hansen, Facundo Toscano, Diego Garcia Lambas 11 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Physical Review D Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Recent papers have reported an unexplained cooling of CMB photons passing through galaxies in nearby cosmic filaments $z<0.02$ at the $>5\\sigma$ level. Here we show for the first time that this effect is also present at higher redshifts $0.02<z<0.04$. Instead of calculating the CMB temperature around individual galaxies as in previous works, we analyze mean CMB temperature profiles associated to cosmic filaments in three dimensions. We have considered different thresholds in the linear K-band luminosity density of the filaments as a proxy to mass density. Furthermore, we have analyzed the dependence of the results on the average orientation of filaments with respect to the line of sight. These studies were implemented to test the expected dependence on mass density as well as on photon trajectory length within the cosmic filaments. We find a $3-4\\sigma$ detection of a temperature decrement trend towards the spine of the filaments, the larger the mass and the more radially oriented the filament, the stronger the temperature decrement. This trend is seen independently in both redshift ranges $0.004<z<0.02$ and $0.02<z<0.04$. We therefore conclude that our results provide strong evidence for a lower CMB temperature along massive cosmic filaments in the nearby universe $z<0.04$.",

We have processed 82,752 HST images across 23 filters into 16,686 mosaics using the same software and processing pipeline throughout. Using 17/23 filters that give reliable galaxy counts, we constrain the integrated galaxy light (IGL) with a 1.5-9\\% error between 0.3 and 1.6 $\\mu$m in combination with 8 bands from WAVES (Wide Area VISTA Extragalactic Survey) and DEVILS (Deep Extragalactic Visible Legacy Survey). While HST was never intended to undertake large area surveys, through extensive quality control and filtering, we were able to extract a reliable and representative sample of fields distributed across the sky. Our final catalogs cover a combined $\\approx 19.6 °^2$, with individual filters covering areas ranging from $\\approx 0.16-7.0 °^2$. The combination of numerous independent sight-lines and area coverage allows us to reduce cosmic variance uncertainties in deep number counts to 0.06\\%-1.8\\%.

Different techniques used to measure the COB, both directly and indirectly, have recently converged indicating that the COB arises almost exclusively from processes within galaxies.

In this work, we investigate how the presence of cosmic strings can catalyze the decay process. To this end, we consider a complex scalar field charged under a global or local $U(1)$ symmetry. Assuming a non-trivial vacuum manifold, realizable for example in a simple sextic potential, we derive relativistic bounce solutions with $O(2) \\times O(2)$ symmetry, corresponding to elongated bubbles seeded by a cosmic string of the same scalar field. Building up on earlier results in the literature, we identify the region of parameter space where vacuum decay predominantly proceeds via this alternative channel, thereby providing an explicit mechanism for the quantum decay of cosmic strings. Finally, we present an initial discussion of the gravitational wave signal associated with this type of vacuum decay and its possible connection to the recently observed stochastic signal in pulsar timing arrays.",

MacCrann, M. Manera, T. Manning, J. L. Marshall See this https URL for the full DES Y6 3x2pt cosmology release. Version with minor typos fixed Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present cosmology results combining galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing measured in the full six years (Y6) of observations by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) covering $\\sim$5000 deg$^2$. We perform a large-scale structure analysis using three two-point correlation functions (3$\\times$2pt): (i) cosmic shear from 140 million source galaxy shapes, (ii) galaxy clustering of 9 million lens galaxy positions, and (iii) galaxy-galaxy lensing from their cross-correlation. We model the data in flat $\\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM cosmologies. The combined analysis yields $S_8\\equiv \\sigma_8 (\\Omega_{\\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.789^{+0.012}_{-0.012}$ and matter density $\\Omega_{\\rm m} = 0.333^{+0.023}_{-0.028}$ in $\\Lambda$CDM (68\\% CL), where $\\sigma_8$ is the clustering amplitude. These constraints show a (full-space) parameter difference of 1.8$\\sigma$ from a combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary anisotropy datasets from Planck 2018, ACT-DR6, and SPT-3G DR1. Projected only into $S_8$ the difference is $2.6\\sigma$. In $w$CDM the Y6 3$\\times$2pt results yield $S_8 = 0.782^{+0.021}_{-0.020}$, $\\Omega_{\\rm m} = 0.325^{+0.032}_{-0.035}$, and dark energy equation-of-state parameter $w = -1.12^{+0.26}_{-0.20}$. For the first time, we combine all DES dark-energy probes: 3$\\times$2pt, SNe Ia, BAO and Clusters. In $\\Lambda$CDM this combination yields a $2.8\\sigma$ parameter difference from the CMB. When combining DES 3$\\times$2pt with other low-redshift datasets (DESI DR2 BAO, DES SNe Ia, SPT clusters), we find a 2.3$\\sigma$ parameter difference with CMB. A joint fit of Y6 3$\\times$2pt, CMB, and those low-redshift datasets produces the tightest $\\Lambda$CDM constraints to date: $S_8 = 0.806^{+0.006}_{-0.007}$, $\\Omega_{\\rm m} = 0.302^{+0.003}_{-0.003}$, $h = 0.683^{+0.003}_{-0.002}$, and $\\sum m_\\nu < 0.14$ eV (95\\% CL). In $w$CDM, this combination yields $w = -0.981^{+0.021}_{-0.022}$.",

Whitaker Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) JWST has revealed a stunning population of bright galaxies at surprisingly early epochs, $z>10$, where few such sources were expected. Here we present the most distant example of this class yet -- MoM-z14, a luminous ($M_{\\rm{UV}}=-20.2$) source in the COSMOS field at $z_{\\rm{spec}}=14.44^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ that expands the observational frontier to a mere 280 million years after the Big Bang. The redshift is confirmed with NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy through a sharp Lyman-$\\alpha$ break and $\\sim3\\sigma$ detections of five rest-UV emission lines. The number density of bright $z_{\\rm{spec}}\\sim14-15$ sources implied by our \"Mirage or Miracle\" survey spanning $\\sim350$ arcmin$^{2}$ is $>100\\times$ larger ($182^{+329}_{-105}\\times$) than pre-JWST consensus models. The high EWs of UV lines ($\\sim15{-}35$ Å) signal a rising star-formation history, with a $\\sim10\\times$ increase in the last 5 Myr ($\\rm{SFR_{\\rm{5Myr}}}/\\rm{SFR_{\\rm{50Myr}}}=9.9^{+3.0}_{-5.8}$). The source is extremely compact (circularized $r_{\\rm{e}} = 74^{+15}_{-12}$ pc), and yet elongated ($b/a=0.25^{+0.11}_{-0.06}$), suggesting an AGN is not the dominant source of UV light. The steep UV slope ($\\beta=-2.5^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$) implies negligible dust attenuation and a young stellar population. The absence of a strong damping wing provides tentative evidence that the immediate surroundings of MoM-z14 may be partially ionized at a redshift where virtually every reionization model predicts a $\\sim100\\%$ neutral fraction. The nitrogen emission and highly super-solar [N/C]$>1$ hint at an abundance pattern similar to local globular clusters that may have once hosted luminous supermassive stars. Since this abundance pattern is also common among the most ancient stars born in the Milky Way, we may be directly witnessing the formation of such stars in dense clusters, connecting galaxy evolution across the entire sweep of cosmic time.",

Successful and choked jets, as well as the accretion disk, corona, wind, and outflow regions in a TDE have been examined and shown to produce TeV - PeV neutrinos. In this work, we use the IceCube 12.5 year high energy starting events (HESE) dataset and perform a maximum likelihood analysis to investigate the spatial and temporal correlations between HESE dataset and a selected sample of 89 TDEs. Our results indicate that the currently observed data do not show any significant correlation and hence is consistent with the background only hypothesis. Using this result, we place constraints on the fraction of TDEs harboring intrinsic jets ($f_{\\rm jet}$) and the corresponding isotropic-equivalent cosmic ray (CR) energy ($\\mathcal{E}_{\\rm CR}$). We note that even with limited statistics, we can constrain the parameter space as $\\mathcal{E}_{\\rm CR} \\lesssim 3 \\times 10^{53}$ erg for $f_{\\rm jet} \\gtrsim 0.6$ at more than 90% C.L. Finally, we discuss the theoretical implications of our results and the limits on the all-sky diffuse neutrino flux from TDEs. With more observational data in the electromagnetic band for TDEs and neutrino observations from IceCube and KM3NeT, our analysis can be used to place stringent constraints on physical parameters associated with TDEs.",

Main text 41 pages, 32 figures with additional appendices High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Here we present the results of our search through the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) for extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs) - a rare classification of galaxies displaying strong, high-ionization iron coronal emission lines within their spectra. With the requirement of a strong X-ray continuum to generate the coronal emission, ECLEs have been linked to both active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and tidal disruption events (TDEs). We focus our search on identifying TDE-linked ECLEs. We identify three such objects within the EDR sample, highlighting DESI's effectiveness for discovering new nuclear transients, and determine a galaxy-normalized TDE-linked ECLE rate of $R_\\mathrm{G}=5~^{+5}_{-3}\\times10^{-6}~\\mathrm{galaxy}^{-1}~\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at a median redshift of z = 0.2 - broadly consistent with previous works. Additionally, we also identify more than 200 AGNs displaying coronal emission lines, which serve as the primary astrophysical contaminants in searches for TDE-related events. We also include an outline of the custom python code developed for this search.",

We argue that this leads to a non-zero value of a certain CP-violating observable ${\\cal C}$, defined below. The effect can be masked by parity violating plasma currents. In particular, evidence for polarization flips \\cite{flip} in the signals from M87* indicate strong plasma effects in the data. We suggest that time averaging the data over periods including the flip might leave over a residual that would be an indicator of the FK signal. In addition, similarities in the polarization patterns between the two very different black holes, and a part of the signal that is uniform in frequency, might enable us to distinguish the universal topological signal from source and frequency dependent plasma effects. Current data does not appear to be sufficient to perform such a test.",

Panda, C. Piscitelli, A. Tortosa 10 pages, 5 figures, appendix 11 pages. Resubmitted to A&A after revision High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The origin of the radio emission in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is still debated. Multiple physical mechanisms can contribute to the spectrum at these frequencies, including relativistic jets, the jet base, outflows, star formation, and synchrotron emission from the hot corona. Recently, new extreme radio variability has been observed in the class of low-mass/high-Eddington AGN known as narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies, suggesting that another, more exotic mechanism may also play a role, especially at frequencies above 10 GHz. To investigate this relatively unexplored area of the radio spectrum, we observed a sample of 50 NLS1s with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA), and 20 of them were observed twice. In this sample, 24 sources were not detected, while the others are typically characterized by a steep spectrum that can be modeled with a power law. We also identified two new candidate jetted NLS1s, including a high-frequency peaker, which is an extremely young relativistic jet. We found no significant variability in the sources observed twice. We conclude that the radio spectrum of NLS1s is typically dominated by optically thin emission, likely from low-power outflows, or by circumnuclear star formation, with a limited contribution from relativistic jets. Further studies at different spatial scales and at other wavelengths are necessary to fully constrain the origin of the radio emission in this class of active galaxies.",

In preparation for submission to Machine Learning: Science and Technology High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Machine Learning (cs.LG) We develop a machine learning model based on a structured variational autoencoder (VAE) framework to reconstruct and generate neutron star (NS) equations of state (EOS). The VAE consists of an encoder network that maps high-dimensional EOS data into a lower-dimensional latent space and a decoder network that reconstructs the full EOS from the latent representation. The latent space includes supervised NS observables derived from the training EOS data, as well as latent random variables corresponding to additional unspecified EOS features learned automatically. Sampling the latent space enables the generation of new, causal, and stable EOS models that satisfy astronomical constraints on the supervised NS observables, while allowing Bayesian inference of the EOS incorporating additional multimessenger data, including gravitational waves from LIGO/Virgo and mass and radius measurements of pulsars. Based on a VAE trained on a Skyrme EOS dataset, we find that a latent space with two supervised NS observables, the maximum mass $(M_{\\max})$ and the canonical radius $(R_{1.4})$, together with one latent random variable controlling the EOS near the crust--core transition, can already reconstruct Skyrme EOSs with high fidelity, achieving mean absolute percentage errors of approximately $(0.15\\%)$ for $(M_{\\max})$ and $(R_{1.4})$ derived from the decoder-reconstructed EOS.",

Considering two plausible scenarios, AGN jets and winds, we model the X-ray, GeV, and TeV emission during both TeV-low (quasi-quiet) and TeV-high (active) states. The spectral energy distributions can be explained either by single-zone leptonic emission from moderately relativistic jets or by lepto-hadronic emission from sub-relativistic winds. The best-fit parameters suggest that the transition from the quasi-quiet to the active state may be driven jointly by an enhanced accretion rate and the expansion of jets or winds. We further show that future MeV and very-high-energy $\\gamma$-ray observations can discriminate between the {leptonic and lepto-hadronic scenarios}. Although the neutrino flux from NGC~1068 predicted by the wind model is too low to be detected with current neutrino observatories, a lepto-hadronic wind scenario can account for the PeV diffuse neutrino background when adopting a local LLAGN density corrected for the TeV duty cycle, $n_{\\rm L,0}(\\Delta T_{\\rm TeV}/T) \\sim 10^{-5}~\\rm Mpc^{-3}$, as inferred from the LHAASO detection.",

      "abstract": "Compton hump reverberation lag in the bright Seyfert 1 galaxy IC 4329A with NuSTAR Samuzal Barua, Hengxiao Guo, Minfeng Gu, Wenwen Zuo Accepted for Publication in ApJ, 14 pages, 8 figures, 1 Table High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Recent reverberation delay measurements have moved beyond the 10 keV X-ray range, providing evidence for the Compton hump (a.k.a. reflection hump) in the lag spectra. We report the relativistic reverberation of the reflection hump in the bright Seyfert\\,1 galaxy IC\\,4329A based on a long {\\it NuSTAR} observation. We find a delayed response of the 20--30 keV X-ray band, with a lag time of $\\sim1825$ s at frequencies $0.5-1.5 \\times 10^{-4}$ Hz. The lag amplitude drops to $\\sim195$ s as the frequencies increase to $(1.5-10)\\times10^{-4}$ Hz. Including IC\\,4329A, so far five sources have been explored for reflection hump reverberation. We perform reverberation modelling of the 3--50 keV lag-energy spectra using the general relativistic transfer function code, which provides independent timing-based measurements of the black hole mass $M_{\\rm BH}=1.37_{-0.36}^{+0.33}\\times10^8~M_{\\odot}$ and the coronal height $h=2.45_{-2.36}^{+1.92}~R_{\\rm g}$ (with uncertainties at 90\\% confidence). Within the uncertainties, the measured mass is found to be consistent with the previous finding. Furthermore, we undertake reflection spectroscopy to account for the hump feature and the associated relativistic effect using the time-averaged flux spectrum. Further sampling of the {\\it NuSTAR} data (with a bin width of 0.2/0.4 keV below and above 10 keV) that reshapes the spectral resolution allows us to constrain the coronal temperature at $50.26_{-4.03}^{+5.58}$ keV -- consistent with the previous result from the combined {\\it Suzaku} and {\\it NuSTAR} data.",

HESS J1813-126, associated with the energetic, radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar PSR J1813-1246, has been suggested as a candidate pulsar halo, though its nature remains uncertain. We interpreted the high-energy emission of PSR J1813-1246 using the synchro-curvature (SC) radiation model and tested whether the gamma-ray spectral energy distribution (SED) of HESS J1813-126 can be explained as a pulsar halo powered by PSR J1813-1246. We explain the X-ray and gamma-ray SEDs of the pulsar using the SC framework. We further computed the transport and losses of $e^\\pm$ injected by the pulsar through time-dependent diffusion-loss equations, exploring various common pulsar halo transport models. The resulting IC emission was compared with \\textit{Fermi}-LAT, H.E.S.S., HAWC, and LHAASO data. We present predictions for the surface brightness profiles (SBPs) and the aperture-dependent emission for the different transport models, providing key diagnostics for assessing the observability of HESS J1813-126 with current and future instruments. The SC framework successfully reproduces the emission of PSR J1813-1246. The SED of HESS J1813-126 can be consistently reproduced within different pulsar halo frameworks, albeit with distinct predictions across different transport models. The corresponding SBP predictions and aperture-dependent emission offer testable signatures for future imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, which will be crucial for discriminating between the transport models. We further examined the link between the pulsar central engine and its extended halo by comparing the pair multiplicities in the magnetospheric and halo regions.",

We compare duration, spectral hardness ratio, minimum variability timescale (MVT), and spectral lag between these components. Both precursors and main bursts have durations and hardness broadly consistent with Type II GRBs. However, precursors show longer MVTs (by factors of 3-10) and diverse lags with near-zero median values, while main bursts display variable MVTs and positive lags. These differences suggest precursors may originate from distinct dissipation conditions, possibly due to cocoon shock breakout or early magnetically dominated outflows. Despite temporal differences, both episodes are consistent with a single collapsar origin, providing no evidence for dual-progenitor events. Our findings support pulse-resolved classification and show that precursors offer critical insights into jet formation and pre-burst activity.",

Still, they come with limitations imposed by finite computing power, whose impact is not straightforward to evaluate a priori. Observational features are hence required as verification. energy electrons accelerated at external shocks, provides a testbed for such predictions. Current numerical studies suggest that in GRB afterglows the maximum synchrotron photon energy, which corresponds to the limit of electron acceleration, may fall within the $\\sim$ 0.1--10 keV X-ray energy band at late times, $t\\gtrsim 10^6 - 10^7$ s. To test this prediction, we analyzed the X-ray spectra of six GRBs with \\emph{Swift}/XRT detections beyond $10^7$ s: our analysis reveals no clear evidence of a spectral cutoff. Using a model that accounts for the effect of the finite opening angle of the shock on the observed maximum synchrotron photon energy, we show that these observations are incompatible with PIC simulation predictions, unless one or more physical afterglow parameters attain values at odds with those typically inferred from afterglow modeling (small radiative efficiency, low ambient density, large equipartition fraction $\\epsilon_{\\rm B}$ of the magnetic field). These findings challenge existing numerical simulation results and imply a more efficient acceleration of electrons to high-energies than seen in PIC simulations, with important implications for our understanding of particle acceleration in relativistic shocks.",

Employing a model-agnostic framework based on the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution applied to the second CHIME/FRB catalog, we quantify its rarity within the current population. Bayesian fitting of GEV models to block maxima of peak flux and fluence data reveals FRB 20250316A to be a profound statistical outlier. For the peak flux, the analysis yields a return period of $\\sim$ 600 years ($1\\sigma$ credible level), with the underlying distribution being of the heavy-tailed, unbounded Fréchet type ($\\xi > 0$). The fluence analysis indicates greater complexity: while the full sample suggests a Fréchet-type distribution with a $\\sim50$-year return period in $1\\sigma$ credible level, the removal of three other notable outliers points toward a light-tailed Weibull-type distribution ($\\xi < 0$) with a finite upper bound far exceeded by FRB 20250316A. This dichotomy highlights the challenge in characterizing the tail of the FRB luminosity function with limited data. Although less extreme in recurrence time than the ``Brightest Of All Time'' gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A, FRB 20250316A constitutes a similarly exceptional event (a potential FRB ``BOAT'') within the short observational history of wide-field radio surveys. Our results underscore the existence of rare, highly luminous events that may probe the upper limits or distinct sub-populations of the FRB luminosity distribution.",

We provide a straight forward explanation for these low central entropies in cool core systems and how this is related to accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Assuming a time-averaged equilibrium between active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet heating of the radiatively cooling intracluster medium (ICM) as well as Bondi accretion, we derive an equilibrium entropy that scales with the SMBH and cluster mass as $K\\propto M_\\bullet^{4/3}M_{500\\mathrm{c}}^{-1}$. At fixed cluster mass, overly massive SMBHs would raise the central entropy above the cool core threshold, thus implying a novel way of limiting SMBH masses in cool core clusters. We find a limiting mass of $1.4\\times10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ in a cool core cluster of mass $10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. We carry out three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of an idealized Perseus-like cluster with AGN jets and find that they reproduce the predictions of our analytic model, once corrections for elevated jet entropies are applied in calculating X-ray emissivity-weighted cluster entropies. Our findings have significant implications for modelling galaxy clusters in cosmological simulations: a combination of overmassive SMBHs and high heating efficiencies preclude the formation of cool core clusters.",

We detected 620 anomalous NLSy1s classified into two groups i.e. 246, Red NLSy1s, exhibiting host galaxy dominated spectra with a low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) core revealed by the emission line widths. Another set of 374 Blue NLSy1s, strongly luminous galaxies with enhanced AGN activity, bluer continuum as compared to a typical NLSy1 and stronger Fe II emission. Finally, the third group of 257 outliers, identified as Intermediate Seyferts, a class of Seyfert galaxies identified by composite emission profiles, and extremely strong emission lines paired with virtually no continuum. These sources also exhibit rare and high ionization emission lines unseen in any other NLSy1 spectra (e.g. [Ne V]$\\lambda3345$, Ne V $\\lambda3426$, Ne III $\\lambda3869$ etc).

Hereafter, we call it ``G1010''. G1010 consists of a primary (the most massive) star and inner binary that orbit each other.

G1010 is categorized as a single-lined spectroscopic binary, and its orbital solution indicates that G1010 possibly accompanies a massive compact object, such as a neutron star or massive white dwarf. In order to confirm the presence of a massive compact object, we have performed several-times low signal-to-ratio (SNR) and one-time high SNR spectroscopic observations, and determined the outer orbital parameters. Moreover, we have deeply analyzed the high SNR spectroscopic data, and found that G1010 accompanies not a massive compact object, but an inner binary. We have investigated G1010's light curve in Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and concluded that the inner binary is actually an eclipsing binary, not included in TESS Eclipsing Binary Stars. We have obtained the inner orbital parameters from the TESS light curve. G1010 is similar to compact hierarchical triple star systems previously discovered by eclipse timing variation analysis. Our discovery has shown that such triple star systems can be discovered by combination of low- and high-SNR spectroscopic observations with the help of Gaia DR3 and the upcoming Gaia DR4/DR5.",

X-ray-bright TDEs provide dense photon fields conducive to neutrino production via proton-photon ($p\\gamma$) processes. We conducted a time-dependent unbinned likelihood analysis of ten years (2008-2018) of IceCube muon-track data, focusing on ten TDEs with confirmed X-ray detections during this period. We report a neutrino flare candidate spatially and temporally coincident with the TDE ATLAS17jrp, occurring 19 days after the onset of its X-ray activity and lasting for 56 days, with a post-trial $p$-value of 0.01. This significance is modest, representing a hint of an association. We illustrate the neutrino emission using a simple lepton-hadronic model, where X-ray photons serve as target fields. While this model can account for the neutrino data around 100 TeV, the low-energy neutrinos may imply contributions from an additional component. Although constrained by the sample size of X-ray-detected TDEs, these results underscore the need for high-cadence X-ray monitoring and future neutrino observatories to further explore the connection between TDEs and high-energy neutrinos.",

Farrag Data release at: this https URL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The discovery of joint sources of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves has been a primary target for the LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and IceCube observatories. The joint detection of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves would provide insight into cosmic processes, from the dynamics of compact object mergers and stellar collapses to the mechanisms driving relativistic outflows. The joint detection of multiple cosmic messengers can also elevate the significance of the common observation even when some or all of the constituent messengers are sub-threshold, i.e. not significant enough to declare their detection individually. Using data from the LIGO, Virgo, and IceCube observatories, including sub-threshold events, we searched for common sources of gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos during the third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Our search did not identify significant joint sources. We derive constraints on the rate densities of joint sources. Our results constrain the isotropic neutrino emission from gravitational-wave sources for very high values of the total energy emitted in neutrinos (> $10^{52} - 10^{54}$ erg).",

      "abstract": "Mathematical Anatomy of Neutrino Decoherence in Red Turbulence: A Fractional Calculus Approach Yiwei Bao, Andrea Addazi, Shuai Zha High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a comprehensive study of perturbation theory for neutrino decoherence in power-law correlated turbulent matter, establishing rigorous convergence criteria and providing detailed numerical validation. Starting from the exact Laplace-space solution derived from the generalized master equation with memory kernel $K(t) \\propto t^{-\\nu}e^{-t/\\tau_c}$, we develop a systematic perturbation expansion in the turbulence strength parameter $\\xi$. The expansion is performed around the high-density matter basis where $\\cos 2\\theta_m \\approx 1$, rather than the vacuum basis, reflecting the physical conditions in supernova cores. We obtain explicit expressions for the first few perturbation terms and derive the general structure of higher-order terms, which involve Mittag-Leffler functions that emerge from the fractional dynamics. Using high-precision numerical methods (multiple-precision arithmetic and asymptotic expansions), we analyze the convergence radius and rate of the perturbation series. We find that for $\\xi < \\xi_c \\approx 0.8$, the series converges with error decreasing geometrically. For $\\xi = 0.16$ (typical supernova conditions), third-order perturbation theory achieves $\\sim 1\\%$ accuracy. We provide practical guidelines for applying perturbation theory to realistic astrophysical scenarios and validate all analytical results with extensive numerical computations. Our work clarifies several subtle aspects of the perturbative approach that were not addressed in the original literature, offering a complete toolkit for researchers studying neutrino-turbulence interactions. In particular, we systematically address the ultraviolet divergence of the correlation function at short time scales for spectral indices $\\nu \\geq 1$, introducing a physical small-scale cutoff regularization that ensures mathematical rigor for the fractional master equation and perturbative expansion.",

All analysis scripts/notebooks available via this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Stars form as molecular clouds fragment into networks of dense cores, filaments, and subclusters. The characteristic spacing of these cores is a key observable imprint of fragmentation physics and is commonly measured using nearest-neighbour (NN) statistics. However, NN separations are derived from projected two-dimensional (2D) positions, while fragmentation occurs in three dimensions (3D). Using spherical and fractal toy models, we show that the standard geometric deprojection factor of $4/\\pi\\simeq1.27$ is inadequate because projection not only foreshortens separations but also rewires the NN network, while finite angular resolution merges close neighbours and inflates apparent spacings. We quantify these competing biases with Monte Carlo experiments spanning a wide range of morphologies, sample sizes, and effective resolutions. From these we derive an empirical correction factor that depends on both sample size and resolution: for small ($N\\lesssim10$) or poorly resolved samples ($\\lesssim$10 resolution elements across the field), intrinsic NN spacings exceed projected values by only 20 to 40%, whereas for well-sampled ($N\\gtrsim100$), well-resolved data ($\\gtrsim$30-50 resolution elements), true 3D separations are typically larger by a factor of $\\sim$2. This calibration enables observers to convert measured 2D NN spacings into corresponding 3D estimates, with typical morphology-driven uncertainties of order 30 to 40%, and we demonstrate how it alters inferred fragmentation scales in observed and simulated core populations.

Suess, Guochao Sun 33 pages, 16 figures, submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Observations of the early Universe (z > 4) with the James Webb Space Telescope reveal galaxy populations with a wide range of intrinsic luminosities and colors. Bursty star formation histories (SFHs), characterized by short-term fluctuations in the star formation rate (SFR), may explain this diversity, but constraining burst timescales and amplitudes in individual galaxies is challenging due to degeneracies and sensitivity limits. We introduce a population-level simulation-based inference framework that recovers the power and timescales of SFR fluctuations by forward-modeling galaxy populations and distributions of rest-UV to rest-optical spectral features sensitive to star formation timescales. We adopt a stochastic SFH model based on a power spectral density formalism spanning 1 Myr-10 Gyr. Using simulated samples of N=500 galaxies at z~4 with typical JWST/NIRSpec uncertainties, we demonstrate that: (i) the power of SFR fluctuations can be measured with sufficient precision to distinguish between simulations (e.g., FIRE-2-like vs. Illustris-like populations at >99% confidence for timescales < 100 Myr); (ii) simultaneously modeling stochastic fluctuations and the recent (t_L < 500 Myr) average SFH slope is essential, as secular trends otherwise mimic burstiness in common diagnostics; (iii) frequent, intense bursts impose an outshining limit, and bias inference toward underestimating burstiness due to the obscuration of long-timescale power; and (iv) the power of SFR fluctuations can be inferred to 95% confidence across all timescales in both smooth and bursty populations. This framework establishes a novel and robust method for placing quantitative constraints on the feedback physics regulating star formation using large, uniformly selected spectroscopic samples.",

To assess the influence of these internal and external drivers on bar rotation in a cosmological setting, we use the Auriga suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations. We calculate the bar pattern speed and the bar rotation rate - the ratio of corotation radius to bar length - at the time of bar formation and at z=0, and compare these to bar age, bar strength, baryon dominance, galaxy stellar mass, and the history of external galaxy interactions. We find that galaxies which are more baryon dominated at z=0 - and which lie above the observed stellar mass-halo mass abundance matching relation - host faster bars, while more dark matter dominated galaxies host slower bars. Baryon-dominated galaxies also form their bars earlier and their rotation rates stay constant or even decrease over time; this leads to older bars being faster than their younger counterparts - in contrast to the expectation of bar slow-down from dynamical friction imparted by the dark matter halo. We also find a trend in stellar mass, with 'faster' bars being hosted in more massive galaxies, which could be driven by the underlying higher baryon-dominance of more massive galaxies. Furthermore, we find that external interactions, such as mergers and flybys, correlate with lower bar rotation rates, particularly for strong interactions that occur around bar formation time. This correlation is relatively weak, leaving internal baryon-dominance as the main driver of fast bar rotation rates.",

To investigate how Haro 11's properties arise, we perform a radiation hydrodynamics simulation of the merger, and create mock observations of LyC, Ly$\\alpha$, and H$\\alpha$, from which we compute their luminosities ($L$) and escape fractions ($f_{\\rm esc}$). We track these quantities along multiple sightlines as the two progenitor galaxies merge, from the first interaction until the system resembles present-day Haro 11. We find that $L$ and $f_{\\rm esc}$ vary by 1-2 orders of magnitude for LyC due to sightline variations. At the two pericentre passages, the total $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm LyC}$ increases by roughly an order of magnitude. Conversely, $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm Ly\\alpha}$ shows a moderate increase at the pericentre passages, which affects the inference of LyC properties from Ly$\\alpha$. We attribute this to a displacement of the LyC-emitting stars relative to the \\Lya-emitting gas, combined with an increased density from gas compression. Furthermore, $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm LyC}$ is boosted during star formation bursts, likely due to stellar feedback. As direct comparison with Haro 11, the simulation qualitatively matches its morphology and luminosities. We find that among the dense stellar knots, knot C is the main contributor to both intrinsic and escaping LyC emission. Additionally, the Ly$\\alpha$ spectra displays distinct features found in observations, implying similar gas conditions are present.",

Marulli 21 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Euclid Early Release Observations (ERO) programme targeted the Perseus galaxy cluster in its central region over 0.7deg$^2$. We combined the exceptional image quality and depth of the ERO-Perseus with FUV and NUV observations from GALEX and AstroSat/UVIT, as well as $ugrizH\\alpha$ data from MegaCam at the CFHT, to deliver FUV-to-NIR magnitudes of the 87 brightest galaxies within the Perseus cluster. We reconstructed the star-formation history (SFH) of 59 early-type galaxies (ETGs) within the sample, through the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code CIGALE and state-of-the-art stellar population (SP) models to reproduce the galactic UV emission from hot, old, low-mass stars (i.e. the UV upturn). In addition, for the six most massive ETGs in Perseus [stellar masses $\\log_{10}(M_{\\ast}/M_{\\odot}) \\geq 10.3$], we analysed their spatially resolved SP through a radial SED fitting. In agreement with our previous work on Virgo ETGs, we found that (i) the majority of ETGs needs the presence of an UV upturn to explain their FUV emission, with temperatures $\\langle T_{\\rm UV}\\rangle$~33800 K; (ii) ETGs have grown their stellar masses quickly, with SF timescales $\\tau\\lesssim 1500$ Myr. We found that all ETGs in the sample have formed more than about 30% of their stellar masses at z~5, up to ~100%. At z~5, the stellar masses of the most massive nearby ETGs, which have present-day stellar masses $\\log_{10}(M_{\\ast}/M_{\\odot})\\gtrsim 10.8$, are then found to be comparable to those of the red quiescent galaxies observed by JWST at similar redshifts (z>4.6). This study can be extended to ETGs in the 14000 deg$^2$ extragalactic sky that will soon be observed by Euclid, in combination with those from other major upcoming surveys (e.g. Rubin/LSST), and UV observations, to ultimately assess whether the nearby massive ETGs represent the progeny of the massive high-z JWST red quiescent galaxies.",

Khalid Accepted for publication in MNRAS; 15 pages, 12 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We measure the radial $g-i$ colour profiles of $\\sim$32,000 galaxies drawn from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program optical imaging survey, including 1415 exhibiting tidal features. We compare the colour profiles of galaxies with and without tidal features to extract information about the properties of the mergers that created these features. We find negative colour gradients for both galaxies with and without tidal features and find that tidal feature-hosting red sequence galaxies have redder outskirts than their non-tidal feature hosting counterparts, consistent with the outskirts of these galaxies being dominated by stars accreted from gas-poor minor mergers. We find decreasing mass ratios of tidal features-to-host galaxy with increasing galaxy stellar mass, suggesting that less massive galaxies undergo mergers with companions closer in mass than more massive galaxies. Galaxies exhibiting streams have bluer outskirts than those hosting shells, and shells around red sequence galaxies tend to be more massive and have higher mass ratios to their hosts than streams, consistent with streams being formed from mergers with satellites less massive than those responsible for shells. The agreement between our findings and those of other observational and simulation-based works confirms the validity of our methodology and highlights the value of tidal features colours as a probe into the process through which galaxies evolve.",

Catalogs and Stokes I image available at this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a study of the linear polarization properties of radio sources within the 10 deg$^2$ Wide Chandra Deep Field South (W-CDFS) in S-band (2-4 GHz). Our W-CDFS image has an angular resolution of 15 arcsec and a 1$\\sigma$ RMS in Stokes $I$ of $\\approx$50 $\\mu$Jy/beam. We detect 1920 distinct source components in Stokes $I$ and 175 in linear polarization. We examine the polarized source counts, Faraday Rotation measures, and fractional polarization of the sources in the survey. We show that sources with a total intensity above $\\approx$10mJy have a mean fractional polarization value of $\\approx$3% from modeling the polarized counts. We also calculate an estimate for the limit on the fractional polarization level of sources with a total intensity below 1mJy (mostly star-forming galaxies) of $\\stackrel{<}{_{\\sim}}$3% using stacking. The mean Faraday Rotation we measure is consistent with that due to the Milky Way. We also show that fractional polarization is correlated with in-band spectral index, consistent with a lower mean fractional polarization for the flat-spectrum population. In addition to characterizing the S-band polarization properties of sources in the W-CDFS, this study will be used to validate the shallower, but higher angular resolution S-band polarimetric information that the VLA Sky Survey will provide for the whole sky above Declination -40 degrees over the next few years.",

In particular, the observed relation between the mass of the most massive star formed in an embedded cluster and the cluster's total stellar mass supports a deterministic sampling process, known as optimal sampling. However, the physical origin of optimal sampling has not been formally established in the literature. In this work, we show that the stellar mass distribution implied by optimal sampling emerges from applying the Maximum Entropy principle to the fragmentation of star-forming clumps, whose structure is set by density-dependent cooling in the optically thin regime. Here, the maximum entropy leads to unbiased distributions. By applying calculus of variations to minimize the entropy functional obtained assuming fragmentation, we recover the power-law form of the sIMF, and we show that any distribution deviating from the sIMF violates the Maximum Entropy principle. This work provides a first-principles foundation for the deterministic nature of star formation. Thus, the sIMF is the distribution resulting from a maximally unbiased system.",

Sormani, B. Thorsbro Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics (A&A). The manuscript includes 13 pages, 12 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Nuclear Stellar Disc (NSD) of the Milky Way is a dense, rotating stellar system in the central 200 pc. The NSD is thought to be primarily fuelled by bar-driven gas inflows from the inner Galactic disc. As part of the LEGARE project, we construct the first chemical evolution models for the NSD using a Bayesian approach tailored to reproduce the observed metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) and compared with the available abundance ratios for Mg, Si, Ca relative to Fe. We adopt a state-of-the-art chemical evolution model in which the gas responsible for the formation of the NSD is assumed to be driven by the Galactic bar-induced inflows. The chemical composition of the accreted material is assumed to reflect that of the Galactic disc at a radius of 4 kpc. A Bayesian MCMC framework is used to fit the MDFs of different samples of NSD stars. If we take the NSD data at face value, without considering a possible contamination from bulge stars, we find that a formation scenario based on the inner disc flowing gas is inconsistent with the low metallicity tail of the observed MDF. This is because the inner disc metallicity, at the epoch of bar formation, was already near solar. On the other hand, models invoking dilution from additional metal-poor inflows successfully reproduce the observations. The best-fit model requires inflow metallicity 5 times lower than the inner disc and a moderate star formation efficiency. The same model successfully reproduces the observed [$\\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] ratios and predicts a star formation history consistent with the most recent estimates. However, if we assume that the MDF is contaminated by metal poor bulge stars and restricted to [Fe/H] > -0.3 dex, gas dilution is no longer required. In this case, the best-fit model has a very low star formation efficiency and a mild galactic wind.",

We present a multi-modal deep learning framework that jointly leverages spatial and spectral information from CO observations to infer outflow mass, inclination, and position angle ($PA$). Our model, trained on synthetic ALMA observations generated from 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations, utilizes a cross-attention fusion mechanism to integrate morphological and kinematic features with probabilistic uncertainty estimation. Our results demonstrate that Vision Transformer architectures significantly outperform convolutional networks, showing remarkable robustness to reduced spatial resolution. Interpretability analysis reveals a physically consistent hierarchy: spatial features dominate across all parameters, whereas spectral profiles provide secondary constraints for mass and inclination. Applied to observational ALMA data, the framework delivers stable mass and $PA$ estimates with exceptionally tightly constrained inclination angles. This study establishes multi-modal deep learning as a powerful, interpretable tool for overcoming projection biases in high-mass star formation studies.",

We examine the impact of the blending in the number count and luminosity function analyses using the SPHEREx data. We find that the number count can be overestimated by up to $10$--$20\\%$ in the deep regions due to the flux boosting, suggesting that the impact of galaxy-galaxy blending on the number count is moderate. However, galaxy-galaxy blending can marginally change the luminosity function by up to 50\\%\\ over a wide range of redshifts.

Recent research indicates a noticeable decline in the rotation curve (RC) of the Milky Way (MW), suggesting the need for a new low-mass model to describe its dynamical features. This study constructs a new Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger model to characterize the RC features of our galaxy. We use the GIZMO code to simulate mergers with various orbital parameters to investigate how the disk warp evolves under different conditions. This simulation demonstrates the evolutionary mechanism of disk warp, which arises due to the asymmetric gravitational potential of the dark matter (DM) halo generated universally by galaxy mergers. The results indicate that the tilt angle of the DM halo partly reflects the gravitational strength at the $Z=0$ plane, while the gravitational strength on the disk plane reflects the amplitude of disk warp. We identify a dual-regime interaction mechanism driven by the asymmetric halo potential. On short timescales, we find a distinct anti-correlation between the halo's tilt angle and the disk's warp amplitude, indicating a `seesaw' mechanism of angular momentum exchange. On secular timescales, however, dynamical friction drives a global alignment, causing both the halo tilt and the warp amplitude to decay simultaneously. Furthermore, we demonstrate that high-inclination mergers can sustain long-lived prograde precession, where the persistent yet decaying gravitational torque maintains the prograde bending mode against differential wind-up.",

      "abstract": "Little Red Dots and Supermassive Black Hole Seed Formation in Ultralight Dark Matter Halos Dongsu Bak, Jae-Weon Lee Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate how supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds form in the early Universe at the centers of ultralight dark matter (ULDM) halos. Focusing on the ULDM Jeans scale, we identify the critical conditions under which high-redshift baryonic gas, strongly confined by central solitonic cores of the halos, undergoes direct and monolithic collapse. The solitonic potential naturally drives rapid inflow and shock heating, allowing the gas to exceed the critical atomic-cooling and fragmentation-suppression threshold of $\\sim 3 \\times 10^4 {\\rm K}$ without invoking an external UV background. We derive semi-analytic relations for the halo mass, soliton mass, baryonic core radius, and thermodynamic state of the gas, including the effects of baryonic contraction. These relations simultaneously determine the minimum and maximum SMBH seed masses as functions of redshift. In this framework, pristine gas clouds that satisfy the temperature threshold collapse without fragmentation, forming SMBH seeds with characteristic masses of order $\\sim 10^5M_\\odot$, while systems below the threshold are expected to form compact star clusters instead. Our model also implies an upper limit on the attainable SMBH mass, predicting a maximum mass scale of order $\\sim10^{10}M_\\odot$, consistent with the most massive quasars observed to date. The ULDM particle mass required to reproduce the inferred seed mass scale, $m \\simeq 10^{-22}{\\rm eV}$, coincides with the value favored by galactic-scale observations, providing a unified explanation for the characteristic masses of both galactic cores and early SMBH seeds. Our model predicts efficient SMBH seed formation at redshifts $z \\gtrsim 10$ and offers a natural interpretation of recently observed little red dots as SMBHs embedded in compact, hot, ionized gas clouds.",

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will deliver multi-band light curves for millions of AGN, enabling variability studies at a true population scale. We synthesize recent results from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which demonstrate that optical variability amplitudes and timescales are primarily regulated by accretion state, with secondary dependence on black hole mass and redshift, and establish the feasibility of survey-driven continuum reverberation mapping. ZTF measurements reveal optical continuum-emitting region sizes that often exceed standard thin disk predictions, implicating diffuse continuum emission from the broad line region as a significant contributor to observed inter-band lags. We evaluate the implications of LSST cadence and survey strategy, particularly the deep drilling fields, for continuum and emission line reverberation mapping, changing-look AGN, extreme variability quasars, and periodic variability searches. Key limitations of broadband photometric variability are identified, including variable emission line contamination, diffuse BLR continuum emission, and cadence-dependent lag recoverability. We argue that realizing LSST's full scientific potential requires community-scale, standardized variability metric pipelines, probabilistic classification integrated with alert brokers for follow-up triggering, and complementary medium-band photometric observations to isolate the accretion disk continuum. Together, these elements will enable LSST to convert photometric variability into quantitative constraints on accretion disks, BLR structure, and supermassive black hole growth across cosmic time.",

Perez-Gonzalez, Javier Alvarez-Marquez, Masami Ouchi, Yurina Nakazato, Yoshiaki Ono, Kimihiko Nakajima, Hiroya Umeda, Yuki Isobe, Yi Xu, Yechi Zhang Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) One of the major discoveries by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the identification of a large population of luminous galaxies at $z>10$, challenging theoretical models for early galaxy formation. The unexpectedly high number density of these systems has triggered intense debate about potential differences in the physical properties of galaxies at such extreme redshifts and those at lower redshift. However, progress has been limited by the lack of rest-frame optical diagnostics, which are critical for constraining the key properties. Here we present deep JWST/MIRI observations of a UV-luminous galaxy at $z=11.04$, CEERS2-588, only 400 Myr after the Big Bang. CEERS2-588 is detected in the MIRI F560W and F770W bands, while deep MIRI/MRS spectroscopy yields no detection of H$\\alpha$ or [OIII]$\\lambda5007$ line, revealing a prominent Balmer break detected for the first time at $z>10$. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting indicates an extended star formation history possibly reaching $z>15$, followed by rapid quenching within the recent $\\sim10$ Myr, in stark contrast to other $z>10$ galaxies. The MIRI detections also significantly improve our stellar mass estimate to $\\mathrm{log}(M_*/M_\\odot)=9.1^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$, making CEERS2-588 the most massive galaxy securely confirmed at $z>10$. Remarkably, the inferred gas-phase metallicity is near solar, exceeding predictions from current theoretical models. These results suggest that efficient starbursts play a key role in producing the abundant luminous galaxy population in the early universe.",

Maindl, Giulia Santucci, Iris Breda Accepted by A&A 24 January 2026 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are among the densest stellar systems in the Universe and often coexist with supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at galaxy centres. While SMBH formation histories are essentially lost, NSCs preserve evolutionary imprints through their stellar populations and stellar kinematics, reflecting the cumulative effects of mergers, accretion, and internal dynamical evolution. We aim to investigate the orbital structure of the unusually large NSC in FCC 47 (NGC 1336) by decomposing its stellar orbits into dynamically distinct components. We extract stellar kinematics, and in particular the line-of-sight velocity distributions (LOSVDs), from VLT/MUSE integral-field spectroscopy using the non-parametric Bayes-LOSVD approach, and apply triaxial Schwarzschild orbit-superposition modelling with the DYNAMITE software. We decompose the orbit library into hot, warm, cold, and counter-rotating components. We detect triple-peaked LOSVDs in the nucleus, indicating a complex orbital structure. The NSC forms a counter-rotating, kinematically decoupled component. A hot pressure-supported component, a warm counter-rotating structure and a counter-rotating cold disk in the centre suggest hierarchical assembly via early star cluster accretion and later in situ star formation. Our orbital decomposition of FCC 47 supports a hybrid formation scenario for this NSC. Dynamically distinct substructures reflect the interplay of accretion and in situ star formation during galaxy evolution.",

Watkins 12 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We use deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging to study stellar populations in the outer halo of the spiral galaxy M96, located in the dynamically active Leo I galaxy group. Our imaging targets two fields at a projected distance of 50 kpc from the galaxy's center, with a 50% photometric completeness limit of F814W = 28.0, nearly two magnitudes below the tip of the red giant branch. In both fields we find a clear detection of red giant stars in M96's halo, with a space density that corresponds to an equivalent broadband surface brightness of $\\mu_V \\approx $ 31.7 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. We find little evidence for any difference in the spatial density or color of the RGB stars in the two fields. Using isochrone matching we derive a median metallicity for the red giants of [M/H] = -1.36 with an interquartile spread of $\\pm$0.75 dex. Adopting a power-law radial density profile, we also derive a total halo mass of $M_h = 7.8^{+17.4}_{-4.9}\\times10^9$ M$_\\odot$, implying a stellar halo mass fraction of $M_{*,halo}/M_{*,tot} = 15^{+33}_{-9}$%, on the high end for spiral galaxies, but with significant uncertainty. Finally, we find that M96 appears offset from the stellar halo mass-metallicity relationship for spirals, with a halo that is distinctly metal-poor for its halo mass. While a variety of systematic effects could have conspired to drive M96 off this relationship, if confirmed our results may argue for a markedly different accretion history for M96 compared to other spirals in the nearby universe.",

To extract faint CGM emission in the presence of bright point sources, we introduce {\\it CubeCarve}, a dual-channel deconvolution algorithm that separates unresolved quasar emission from spatially extended structure. This approach enables reliable recovery of \\Lya\\ emission projected onto the quasar position without introducing subtraction artifacts. Using {\\it CubeCarve}, we find that the \\Lya\\ surface brightness profiles of these systems are, on average, fainter and shallower than those of quasars of similar bolometric luminosities. We also find that the total integrated \\Lya\\ luminosities of the nebulae are lower in systems whose host galaxies exhibit brighter far-infrared emission. These results suggest that the CGM conditions in composite systems differ from those in the broader quasar population. Our study highlights both the physical diversity of quasar CGM environments and the effectiveness of {\\it CubeCarve} for recovering diffuse emission in modern IFU datasets.",

In comparison, the blue straggler stars, formed via similar mass transfers or mergers, occupy a distinct space in the color-magnitude diagrams. We compile a list of BL candidates in open clusters using available rotation catalogs. BLs can be identified using either unusually faster rotation compared to similar mass stars, which is a signature of recent accretion, or the presence of a companion, which can only be formed by mass donation, e.g., an extremely low mass white dwarf. Here, we searched for fast-rotating stars on the main sequence of open clusters using Kepler, TESS, and spectroscopic rotation indicators, such as rotation periods and $v\\sin i$ measurements. We identified 97 new BL candidates across 35 open clusters, almost tripling the previously known sample of 36. Based on the estimated completeness of $\\approx$3\\%, thousands of BLs are likely hidden within the cluster population. Detailed spectroscopic and time-series analyses will be essential to confirm their mass-transfer histories.",

Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Interstellar object (ISO) astronomy has rapidly emerged over the past decade as a new frontier in planetary astrophysics, yet current observations remain limited by short visibility windows, inference degeneracies and fragmented follow-up capabilities. We argue that these constraints are structural rather than incidental and motivate a coordinated, end-to-end observational strategy for future ISO studies. We propose the Comprehensive ISO Network (CISON) which combines dual hemisphere wide-field discovery with rapid high resolution characterization and selective escalation to interceptor missions. By coupling this architecture to the differential formulation of the Loeb Scale, ISO classification and risk assessment become predictive rather than reactive. This framework transforms ISO astronomy into a mature, scalable discipline capable of maximizing scientific return and informing planetary defense in the coming decades.",

Casey, Alexander Ji, Vedant Chandra, Hans-Walter Rix 26 pages, 12 figures. Submitted to AJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Extremely metal-poor stars are intrinsically rare, but emerging methods exist to accurately classify them from all-sky Gaia XP low-resolution spectra. To assess their overall accuracy for targeting metal-poor stars, we present a high-resolution spectroscopic followup of 75 very metal-poor candidates selected from the catalog by R. Andrae, V. Chandra, and H. W. Rix. We discover 2 new extremely metal-poor ($\\rm{[Fe / H]}<-3$) stars and 20 new very metal-poor ($\\rm{[Fe/H]} < -2$) stars. Abundances of up to 22 elements are derived from 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis and kinematic parameters are derived using Gaia astrometry and spectroscopic radial velocities. The chemodynamical properties are mostly consistent with expectations for halo stars, but we discover an Mg-enhanced CEMP star ($\\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]} = 0.89$) and an Mg-poor star from an accreted ultra-faint dwarf galaxy. The Gaia XP metallicity estimates are consistent with our $\\rm{[Fe/H]}$ measurements down to $\\rm{[Fe/H]}\\sim -3.0$, but estimates worsen in highly extincted regions. We find that 4 other XP-based metallicity catalogs succeed in mitigating contaminants and can also classify metal-poor stars robustly to $\\rm{[Fe/H]}\\sim -3.0$. Our results demonstrate the utility of Gaia XP spectra for identifying the most metal-poor stars across the Galaxy.",

All the stars were observed with the FLAMES high-resolution multi-object spectrograph mounted at the VLT. Our analysis confirmed the presence of a large metallicity range in M 54, with the majority of the stars having -1.8 < [Fe/H] < -1.0 dex and few stars with [Fe/H] > -1.0 dex. The mean value of the total sample is [Fe/H] = -1.40 ({\\sigma} = 0.22 dex). A Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis revealed that the observed spread in [Fe/H] is compatible with a non-null intrinsic iron dispersion. We also found that the metallicity distribution function and the broadening of the red giant branch of M 54 are not compatible with a single age, but instead they suggest a wide age range from ~ 13 Gyr to ~ 1 - 2 Gyr or a smaller age range if a significant He enhancement (Y ~ 0.35/0.40) is present in the most metal-rich stars. We identified among the stars in M 54 the entire pattern of anticorrelations linked to the MgAl burning cycle. In particular, the metal-rich component displays a higher level of H-burning with the presence of more extended anticorrelations than the metal-poor component. No Mg-poor ([Mg/Fe]<0.0 dex) stars are identified in M 54. The evidence collected so far cannot be explained neither with a globular cluster-like scenario nor with a galactic chemical evolution. The chemical properties of M 54 can be explained within a scenario where this system formed through the merging of two globular clusters, the metal-poor one with standard characteristics and the more metal-rich one with more pronounced chemical anomalies, a possibly younger than the first one. M 54 is confirmed as a key stellar system for explaining the chemical evolution of a nuclear star cluster.",

The product of the V-band geometric albedo, $p_V$, with the physical cross-section of the nucleus is $0.22 \\pm 0.07$ km$^{2}$, which corresponds to an effective radius of $1.3 \\pm 0.2$ km if assuming $p_{V} = 0.04$, as is typical for cometary nuclei in the solar system. This size is in agreement with our estimate derived from the reported nongravitational effect and activity of the interstellar object. If the measured photometric variations are solely due to the rotation of an aspherical nucleus, the axis ratio must be $2:1$ or greater, and the rotation period $\\gtrsim\\!1$ hr. Leveraging the range of covered phase angles, we identified a significant opposition surge of $\\sim\\!0.2$ mag with a width of $3^\\circ \\pm 1^\\circ$, which may include concurrent contributions from orbital plane crossing and tail projection, and determined a linear phase slope of $0.026 \\pm 0.006$ mag degree$^{-1}$ for the coma dust. Compared to the preperihelion brightening trend, 3I faded more rapidly on the outbound leg, following an activity index of $4.5 \\pm 0.3$, not unusual in the context of solar system comets. This activity asymmetry is further corroborated by a postperihelion coma surface brightness profile that is significantly shallower than its preperihelion counterpart. From the statistics, we infer that multiple interstellar objects resembling 3I likely went undetected even before the discovery of 1I/`Oumuamua.",

Šatas Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Hot subdwarfs (hot sds) are compact, evolved stars near the Extreme Horizontal Branch (EHB) and are key to understanding stellar evolution and the ultraviolet excess in galaxies. We extend our previous analysis of Gaia XP spectra of hot subdwarf stars to a much larger sample, enabling a comprehensive study of their physical and binary properties. Our goal is to identify patterns in Gaia XP spectra, investigate binarity, and assess the influence of parameters such as temperature, helium abundance, and variability. We analyse approximately 20000 hot subdwarf candidates selected from the literature, combining Gaia XP data with published parameters. We apply Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to the XP coefficients, which represent the Gaia XP spectra in a compact, feature-based form, to construct a similarity map. We then use self-organizing maps (SOMs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify spectra as binaries or singles, and as cool and helium-poor or hot and helium-rich. The spectra are normalised using asymmetric least squares baseline fitting to emphasise individual spectral features. The BP-RP colour dominates the similarity map, with additional influence from temperature, helium abundance, and variability. Most binaries, identified via the Virtual Observatory SED Analyser (VOSA), cluster in two filaments linked to main sequence companions. CNN classification suggests a strong correlation between variability and binarity, with binary fractions exceeding 60 percent for active hot subdwarfs. Gaia XP spectra combined with dimensionality reduction and machine learning effectively reveal patterns in hot subdwarf properties. Our findings indicate that binarity and environmental density strongly shape the evolutionary paths of hot subdwarfs, and we identify possible contamination by main sequence and cataclysmic variable stars in the base sample.",

Submitted to ApJL Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present the first spectroscopic characterization of an interstellar object at mid-infrared wavelengths. Post-perihelion observations of 3I/ATLAS using the JWST/MIRI medium-resolution spectrometer were obtained on 2025 December 15--16 and 27 when the object was at heliocentric distances of 2.20 and 2.54 au, respectively. Our 5--28 micron spectra exhibit fluorescence features from several gaseous species, including the $\\nu_2$ band of water at 5.8--7.0 microns. the primary $\\nu_2$ and associated hot bands of carbon dioxide around 15 microns, and a forbidden transition of atomic nickel at 7.507 microns. We also report the first direct detection of methane in an interstellar object. The delayed onset of methane production relative to water suggests past depletion from the outermost layers, with the observed methane emerging from unprocessed subsurface material. Comparison of the volatile production rates measured during the two epochs indicate a significant reduction in overall outgassing over 12 days, with the measured water activity level dropping more steeply than other species. As shown through near-nucleus coma mapping, 3I continues to display an extended source of water production from icy grains entrained within the coma. Our production rate measurements confirm that 3I exhibits a strongly enhanced CO$_2$:H$_2$O mixing ratio relative to typical solar system comets, as well as a somewhat enriched CH$_4$:H$_2$O value.",

Maccarone, Giuliano Iorio, Sara Rastello, Johanna Müller-Horn Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) BE Lyncis (BE Lyn) is a well-studied high-amplitude $\\delta$ Scuti variable star (HADS). Recently, Niu et al. (2026) analyzed a 39-year baseline of times of maximum light of BE Lyn, reporting that it is the most eccentric binary known ($e \\approx 0.9989$) and hosts the nearest black hole (BH) known to date. We analyze Hipparcos and Gaia astrometry of BE Lyn, predicting what the observed proper motion anomaly (PMA) over the 25 year baseline between the two missions would be were the companion really a $\\gtrsim 17.5\\,M_{\\odot}$ BH. We find that the predicted PMA is at least an order of magnitude larger than the observed value of $\\approx 1.7 \\pm 0.8$ mas yr$^{-1}$, regardless of the assumed orientation of the orbit. We predict the expected Gaia DR3 RUWE for different orientations of the putative BH binary, finding that it ranges from $\\approx 2.5$-$4.0$, much larger than the reported value of $1.073$. The observed value is instead consistent with a low-mass secondary or a single star. We find that BE Lyncis would have received a 7-parameter acceleration solution if it were a BH binary, in contradiction with its absence from the Gaia DR3 non-single star catalogs. Finally, we show that the reported orbit is impossible because the luminous star would overflow its Roche lobe at periastron, irrespective of inclination. We recommend caution in interpreting light-travel time effect (LTTE) models that require very high eccentricities, face-on inclinations, or large companion masses. The observed pulsation timing variations are most likely simply a result of red noise or pulsation phase evolution.",

This work relies on spectra from RUBIES, which provides excellent data quality and an unparalleled, well-defined targeting strategy to robustly infer physical properties and number densities. We identify quiescent galaxy candidates within RUBIES through principal component analysis and construct a final sample using star formation histories derived from spectro-photometric fitting of the NIRSpec PRISM spectra and NIRCam photometry. By inverting the RUBIES selection function, we correct for survey incompleteness and calculate the number density of massive quiescent galaxies at these redshifts, providing the most complete spectroscopic estimates prior to cosmic noon to date. We find that early massive quiescent galaxies are surprisingly common ($\\gtrsim 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ by $4<z<5$), which is consistent with previous studies based on JWST photometry alone and/or in smaller survey areas. We compare our number densities with predictions from six state-of-the-art cosmological galaxy formation simulations. At $z>3$, most simulations fail to produce enough massive quiescent galaxies, suggesting the treatment of feedback and/or the channels for early efficient formation are incomplete in most galaxy evolution models.",

Jang, Joki Rosdahl 22 pages, 20 figures, Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Numerous high-$z$ galaxies have recently been observed with JWST, providing new insights into early galaxy evolution. Their physical properties are typically derived through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, but the reliability of this approach remains uncertain owing to limited constraints on star formation histories (SFHs) and on the contribution from emission for such early systems. Applying \\bagpipes\\ on simulated SEDs with SFR$_{10}>0.3\\,M_\\odot/yr$ at $z=6$ from the SPHINX cosmological simulation, we examine the uncertainties related to the recovery of stellar masses, star formation rates (SFR$_{10}$), and stellar metallicities from mock JWST/Near-Infrared Camera photometry, spanning F115W--F444W. Even without dust or emission lines, fitting the intrinsic stellar continuum overestimates the stellar mass by about 60\\%, on average (and by up to a factor of five for low-mass galaxies with recent starbursts). It also underestimates the SFR$_{10}$ by a factor of 2, due to inaccurate SFHs and age-metallicity degeneracies. In full SED-fitting models that include dust attenuation and nebular emission, stellar mass estimates are primarily affected by age-metallicity degeneracy and emission lines. Short-term SFRs are most sensitive to dust attenuation and nebular emission, while long-term SFRs additionally depend on the assumed SFHs. Incorporating bands that are free of strong emission lines, such as F410M, helps mitigate stellar mass overestimation by disentangling line emission from older stellar populations. We also find that best fit or likelihood-weighted estimates are generally more accurate than median posterior values. Although stellar mass functions are reproduced reasonably well (particularly when the minimum-$\\chi^2$ estimates are used), the slope of the main sequence of star formation acutely depends on the adopted fitting model.

While COMs were once expected to be efficiently destroyed under UV-irradiated conditions, detections in photodissociation regions (PDRs) have challenged this view. However, the mechanisms by which UV radiation contributes to their formation are still uncertain. Here, we present moderately resolved maps of simple and complex organic molecules at the UV-illuminated edge of the Horsehead nebula, obtained by combining ALMA and IRAM 30m single-dish observations at $\\sim 15^{\\prime\\prime}$ resolution. We analyze the spatial distribution of species such as C$^{17}$O, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, CH$_3$CN, and HC$_3$N. By incorporating previous C$^{17}$O and C$^{18}$O single-dish data as well as PdBI maps of H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH, we derive profiles of gas density, temperature, thermal pressure, and column densities of the organic species as a function of distance from the UV source. Our results show that most organic species$-$particularly H$_2$CO, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, and CH$_3$CN$-$exhibit enhanced column densities at the UV-illuminated edge compared to cloud interiors, possibly indicating efficient dust-grain surface chemistry driven by the diffusion of atomic C and radicals produced via photodissociation of CO and CH$_3$OH, as supported by recent laboratory experiments. The exceptions, HC$_3$N and CH$_3$OH, can be attributed to inefficient formation on dust grains and ineffective non-thermal desorption into the gas phase, respectively. Additionally, contributions from gas-phase hydrocarbon photochemistry$-$possibly seeded by grain-surface products$-$cannot be ruled out. Further chemical modeling is needed to confirm the efficiency of these pathways for the studied species, which could have important implications for other cold, UV-irradiated environments such as protoplanetary disks.",

Accepted by Astronomy and Astrophysics Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM) survey is an ESO large programme designed to obtain multi-epoch spectroscopy for 929 massive stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). It will provide binary fractions and orbital configurations of binary systems, and search for dormant black-hole binary candidates (OB+BH). Here we present projected rotational velocities (vsini) of all sources and, using the multiplicity properties presented in previous papers, we derive the vsini distributions of apparent single stars, single lined spectroscopic (SB1) binaries, and SB2 systems. We identify a locus in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram where rotational velocities decrease significantly; we interpret this feature as broadly corresponding to the terminal-age main sequence. The main sequence cohort is distinguished by a broad range of vsini values, but with a strong peak in the distribution in the range 30-60 km/s, close to the resolution limit of 30 km/s. Sources in this low vsini peak are distributed throughout the main sequence, and are also present in the SB1 sample, though less prominent than in the single star distribution. A preliminary analysis of the lowest vsini cohort, that includes SB1 systems, implies that roughly one third may be nitrogen rich and we speculate that this cohort is a mix of pristine single stars, long period binaries, and merger products. The SB2 systems appear to be mostly short period binaries in synchronous rotation and have vsini estimates distributed around a mean value of approximately 140 km/s . Higher vsini sources are also present in the single and SB1 systems, all of which have tail to higher vsini values, consistent with tidal and mass-transfer effects. The supergiants, with a few exceptions, have low vsini, the bulk of these systems being essentially unresolved at current spectral resolution.",

The new imaging spectrophotometry was dominated by spatially resolved features due to light scattered by dust, along with thermal emission, plus gas-line emissions from CN (0.93 um), H2O (2.7 um), organic C-H (3.2 to 3.6 um), CO2 (4.25 to 4.27 um), and CO (4.6 to 4.8 um). The CO2 gas-coma continues to be extended out to a 3 arcmin radius. The continuum spectral signature of H2O-ice absorption had mostly disappeared, replaced by scattered-light plus thermal-emission from organo-silicaceous dust grains while the H2O gas-emission is 40x times brighter. The CO- and CO2-gas comae were circularly symmetric, while the other comae appear morphologically similar to the dust-coma with its pear-shaped, solar-pointing, large icy dust grains dust tail. The new appearance of CN and C-H features suggests that these carbon-rich ice species were contained either in H2O phases or were trapped under them.",

We present 3-8 micron light curves extending 27 years from 1997 to 2024 obtained with three space-based IR telescopes: ISO, Spitzer and WISE. Although unevenly sampled with large gaps in coverage, these light curves show variability on time scales ranging from days to decades. We focus on the Spitzer-identified YSOs with disks and envelopes that exhibit variations of a factor of two or more in this wavelength range. We identified seven YSOs where the light curves are dominated by bursts of sustained (> 5 yr) high flux, including four that show a steep decay ending the burst and three that are ongoing as of the final observation. We find six YSOs that are undergoing declines, which may be the end of bursts that began before 1997. The most common form of variability, exhibited by 26 YSOs in our sample, show variations over time intervals of years to months but do not exhibit sustained bursts or fades. The Spitzer [3.6]-[4.5] and WISE [3.5]-[4.6] colors either increase or remain constant with increasing brightness, inconsistent with dust extinction as being the primary source of the large-amplitude variability.",

During this period, the ion tail of the comet exhibited continual fluctuations and four tail disconnection events (TDEs), each coinciding with the passage of a coronal mass ejection (CME). In this work, we report on the ion tail dynamics of the best observed TDE, which occurred on September 11. The SoloHI white-light images reveal an abrupt bending, subsequent kinks, and severing of a downstream portion of the pre-existing ion tail. The onset of disconnection occurred $\\sim$6.5 hours after the projected passage of the CME leading edge in the images, consistent with a CME flank encounter. After the disconnection, the ion tail reformed within $\\sim$24 hours, with a regrowth rate of $\\sim$86$\\pm7~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$, indicating the rate at which newly ionized material forms along the magnetic field draped around the comet's coma. After the TDE, the detached tail drifted anti-sunward at an estimated speed of $\\sim$295$\\pm20~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$, comparable to the local CME flank's speed, suggesting that the severed plasma was most likely carried away from the comet by the CME. This study provides the first direct, quantitative characterization of comet-CME interactions and the subsequent regrowth phase of a cometary TDE. These measurements were achievable by SoloHI's unique inner-heliospheric coverage, thanks to a combination of high photometric sensitivity, short exposure times, and a wide field of view that preserves the fine-scale tail dynamics.",

The time-series spectra yielded the radial velocities (RVs) of the primary component and its atmospheric parameters, $T_{\\rm eff,A}=7194\\pm70$ K and $v_{\\rm A}\\sin i=68\\pm9$ km s$^{-1}$. Joint modeling of our RVs and the archival TESS data provided component masses of $M_{\\rm A}=1.930\\pm0.054$ $M_\\odot$ and $M_{\\rm B}=0.211\\pm0.005$ $M_\\odot$, radii of $R_{\\rm A}=1.922\\pm0.020$ $R_\\odot$ and $R_{\\rm B}=0.207\\pm0.005$ $R_\\odot$, and luminosities of $L_{\\rm A}=8.87\\pm0.39$ $L_\\odot$ and $L_{\\rm B}=0.546\\pm0.034$ $L_\\odot$. The surface gravity and distance derived from this modeling are consistent with the model-independent $\\log g_{\\rm B}$ obtained from the direct observables and with the Gaia distance. The third light of $l_3=0.136\\pm0.003$ comes mainly from two neighboring stars, TIC 399725539 and TIC 399725544. Comparison with stellar models indicates that TIC 399725538 A lies within the instability region of $\\delta$ Sct$-$$\\gamma$ Dor hybrids, whereas its extremely low-mass companion is markedly underluminous compared to theoretical white dwarf (WD) counterparts. Multifrequency analysis of the binary-subtracted residual lights revealed three significant signals, two of which correspond to aliases at two and four times the dominant frequency $f_1=0.0848$ day$^{-1}$. The $f_1$ frequency is likely a $\\gamma$ Dor-type pulsation arising from the brighter A component, though further confirmation is required. Our results demonstrate that TIC 399725538 is a short-period EL CVn system belonging to the thick-disk population, consisting of a main-sequence $\\gamma$ Dor pulsator and a helium-core WD precursor formed through stable mass transfer.",

Presolar grains are relic dust grains from dying stars. These microscopic dust particles are found in primitive solar system materials. Their distinct isotopic compositions record the nucleosynthetic processes in their parent stars and the Galactic chemical environment in which these stars formed. We studied presolar graphite grains of high-density type from the Murchison meteorite and found five grains with subgrains that show enrichments in 84Sr compared to the solar abundance.84Sr is the neutron-deficient isotope of strontium that can be produced in the deep oxygen-rich interior of high-mass stars that end their lives as core-collapse supernovae. The observed 84Sr excesses cannot be produced in low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars, the source of most high-density presolar graphites found in meteorites. High-density graphites with embedded 84Sr excesses are, instead, compatible with a core-collapse supernovae origin. The graphite subgrains condensed from carbon-rich materials in the outer layers of core-collapse supernovae, where 84Sr was destroyed by neutron captures during hydrostatic evolution of the stars and their final explosion. Based on current theoretical stellar models, a few percent of contribution from the inner regions of core-collapse supernovae, which are enriched in p-process nuclides, to the outer carbon-rich regions is the most likely explanation for the observed enrichment of 84Sr in the subgrains of the high-density graphites. In this study, we present the first observational evidence that core-collapse supernovae produce and eject isotopes made by the p-process.",

Among these, one model called WS model is based on the asymptotic expansion factor. However, it is known that it fails in the case of pseudostreamers. In this study, as a first step toward constructing a solar wind speed empirical model based on physical parameters, we investigated the effect of the radial profile of flux-tube shape on the solar wind speed using one-dimensional numerical simulations. In the simulations, ad hoc Alfvén waves are injected from the photosphere at $r=R_\\odot$ as the energy source, and the MHD equations are solved out to the interplanetary space at $r=70R_\\odot$ to reproduce solar wind acceleration. As a result, even when the coronal base magnetic field and the asymptotic expansion factor are fixed, the final solar wind speed varies by approximately 300 km s$^{-1}$ depending on changes in the expansion height or non-monotonic expansion. Additionally, across all simulations performed, a better correlation is found with the quantities that reflect the information about the radial profile of flux-tube shape than the asymptotic expansion factor. Our results suggest that, as a physical characteristic parameter of the solar wind speed, an operation that can account for the expansion factor throughout the corona is necessary.",

A non-periodic perturbation (in the $xz$-plane) triggers oscillatory reconnection (OR) at the 3D null, resulting in a self-sustained oscillation with a constant period $P$. We investigate the response of the system using three distinct wave proxies (compressible parallel, compressible transverse and incompressible parallel) as well as Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition for decoupling and analyzing the resultant MHD wave behavior. We find that OR generates a slow magnetoacoustic wave of period $P$ that propagates outwards in all directions along the spine and fan plane of the 3D null point. We also find the generation of a propagating Alfvén wave of period $P$, exclusively along the $y$-axis in the fan plane, i.e. in the direction perpendicular to the spine motion. These findings provide new insights into waves generated from a 3D null point and their implications for coronal seismology.",

Hillier Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Cool, dense material is frequently observed to permeate the hot, tenuous solar corona in the form of prominences, spicules and coronal rain. Both the cool material and surrounding corona exist at temperatures that are effectively thermally stable, in that their local radiative losses occur on relatively long timescales compared to the dynamics. However, as the solar atmosphere evolves, driving mixing between the condensations and surrounding hot material, intermediate temperatures form, which can become subject to highly efficient radiative losses. The thermal energy lost due to radiation can far exceed the turbulent heating thus the system undergoes mixing-induced cooling. Here, a 3D radiative MHD simulation is performed of the shear-driven Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI) occurring between a cool condensation and the hot solar corona. During the evolution, thermal instabilities form naturally within the mixing layer, and grow with time to produce long, narrow structures that extend perpendicular to the magnetic field. The thermal instabilities form self-consistently within the mixing layer as small isolated events, and are then stretched by the background flows to create long structures in relatively narrow planes. The turbulent flows agitate the condensations and cause them to fragment, creating smaller localised clumps of cool, dense (prominence-like) material that can merge and further fragment. In the presented simulation, the thermal instabilities act to replenish the cool, dense material lost due to mixing, with the total mass of cool material being approximately constant through time. By analysing the thermal energy loss due to optically-thin radiation, thermal instabilities are found to account for 15-20\\% of all radiative losses in the turbulent plasma.",

Among other things, they demonstrated that although the damping rate of the oscillations in the core of many red giants appears to be negligible, other red giants exhibit high core damping rates that are sometimes consistent with the infinite value limit. Up until now, it has not been possible to link the mixed mode visibilities to core damping rates in a quantitative way. In this study, we use the progressive wave picture to derive an analytical function expressing the approximate resonance pattern of red giants up to a proportionality factor. This function can model the influence of the damping on the oscillations, as well as take into account other effects such as mode asymmetries. In particular, this expression can be used to obtain a quantitative estimate for the visibility of mixed modes and to predict the detectability of mixed mode and multiplet signatures under different core damping rates. Here, we conduct a parameter study to investigate how the damping processes affect these aspects. We find that the visibility approaches the value expected for an infinite core damping rate already at finite values. Furthermore, we find that both the mixed mode and the multiplet signatures disappear at finite core damping rates. This implies that the observational characteristics of red giants with finite core damping rates can appear as if their core damping rate were infinite, providing an explanation for the observed populations. Moreover, we have used our method to quantitatively estimate the core damping rates of red giants with unusually low mixed mode amplitudes from their observed visibilities.",

These stars influence their surroundings through strong winds which are highly structured processes. The theoretical study of the non-symmetric phenomena of the stellar winds are becoming important these days, mainly because 1-D models are not sufficient enough. We present a new version of our Monte Carlo radiative transfer code Andy Antares with improved treatment of the velocity field for arbitrary geometries. Our aim is to develop a numerical scheme that can incorporate a general velocity field defined at discrete points. Our main objective is to calculate radiative transfer in a general input hydrodynamic model. The Andy Antares code currently calculates pure radiative transfer. The input model is pre-calculated by another hydrodynamical code. The whole radiative transfer calculation is then processed in a Cartesian grid. Radiative transfer is solved using the Monte Carlo approach in 3-D regardless of the input hydrodynamical model's dimension. The velocity field at any given point is interpolated using the trilinear interpolation. The optical depth is then integrated numerically along the photon's path. We verified the accuracy of the numerical velocity interpolation by comparison with results obtained for analytical velocity fields, achieving successful outcomes. We also tested the radiative transfer solution on a 3-D model generated from a 2-D hydrodynamic model, and obtained emergent radiation. The code is suitable for the numerical solution of radiative transfer in 3-D with arbitrary velocity fields.",

Submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The evolutionary origin of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars at Solar metallicity is unclear. Single-star evolution from massive O stars, possibly via a Luminous Blue Variable phase, is challenged by binary period distributions of different WR subtypes. Wd1-72 is a WN7b+O binary embedded in the collective wind of the Galactic young massive cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd 1). It is surrounded by highly structured nebulosity, with cometary tails pointing away from Wd 1 and quasi-spherical droplets towards it. In this letter, we demonstrate that this morphology can be qualitatively reproduced by a hydrodynamic simulation of non-conservative Roche Lobe Overflow (RLOF) mass-loss into a cluster wind. Our model is based on a detailed binary evolution track consistent with key known properties of Wd1-72. Our work suggests Wd1-72 could be only ~10 kyr post-RLOF, and the hydrogen-free nature of Wd1-72 favours this being a second or subsequent RLOF episode. Follow-up observations could make Wd1-72 a valuable benchmark for probing mass-loss and mass-transfer in forming gravitational-wave binary-progenitor systems.",

Transit spectroscopy of the TRAPPIST-1 planets has been impacted by the effects of spots and faculae on the host star. Secondary eclipses have detected hot rocks, but evidence for atmospheres has been difficult to obtain. However, there is a third option that we call color phase curves. This method will apply to synchronously rotating non-transiting planets as well as transiting planets. A color phase curve uses photometry at a long-IR wavelength near the peak of the planetary thermal emission (e.g., 21 microns) divided by photometry at a shorter wavelength where the star dominates more strongly (e.g., 12 microns). We avoid wavelengths having potentially strong molecular absorption (e.g., 15 microns) to minimize degeneracies in the color phase curve, and we aim to detect and characterize the planetary atmosphere via its longitudinal heat transfer. The ratio of two wavelengths observed nearly simultaneously is designed to isolate thermal emission from the planet, discriminate against the star, and largely cancel instrumental systematic effects. Moreover, we show that invoking mass-radius relations, and using self-consistent physical models, will permit the longitudinal heat transfer to be measured independent of the orbital inclination. Radial velocity surveys are detecting many new exoplanets, including temperate rocky worlds with Earth-like masses. Most of those planets will not transit, but color phase curves have the potential to detect and characterize their atmospheres.",

We aim to understand the effect of faculae-like field strengths on near-surface stellar convection using 3D radiative MHD simulations of near-surface magneto-convection. We compare simulations of F, G, K and M main-sequence stars with a small-scale dynamo (SSD) to faculae-like spatially averaged field strengths (from 100 to 500 G). We focus on the effect of imposed magnetic field on the thermodynamic stratification and velocities, along with the bolometric intensity and surface field strength. Imposed magnetic fields result in reduced average density and gas pressure near the surface compared to the SSD simulations. The temperature stratification also shows a dip at and just below the stellar surface. The changes in average bolometric intensity are within a percent, with different trends with field strength for different stellar types. In addition, the convective velocities are reduced. The magnitude of changes in thermodynamic quantities are related to field strength as well as the stellar $T_{\\rm eff}$. Faculae-strength magnetic fields modify the near surface convection by reducing gas pressure and density as well as suppressing convection in regions with strong field concentrations. The strength of these effects depends on the stellar type.",

Barstow, Beth Biller, Sarah Rugheimer, Daphne M. Stam, Victor Trees White paper submitted to the UK Space Agency's initiative \"UK Space Frontiers 2035\" Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), planned for launch in the 2040s, represents the next major step in exoplanet characterisation. HWO will, for the first time, enable detailed studies of the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth-like exoplanets through high-contrast reflection spectroscopy across the UV, optical, and near-infrared. These wavelength ranges provide access to key molecular absorption features, including O2, O3, H2O, CO2, and CH4, as well as potential surface biosignatures such as the vegetation red edge or ocean glint, making HWO a cornerstone mission for assessing planetary habitability. Clouds are a dominant factor in determining planetary climate and observability, yet their properties remain highly degenerate when constrained using reflected flux alone. Spectropolarimetry, a measure of the polarisation state of reflected light as a function of wavelength and orbital phase, provides a powerful complementary diagnostic. Polarisation is highly sensitive to cloud particle size, composition, shape, vertical distribution, and surface type, enabling degeneracies between atmospheric and surface models to be broken. Numerous studies have demonstrated the value of polarimetry for characterising a wide range of exoplanets, from hot Jupiters to cooler potentially habitable worlds. HWO's proposed instrument suite includes a coronagraph, a high-resolution imager, and a candidate high-resolution spectropolarimeter, offering multiple pathways to exploit polarimetry across diverse planetary regimes. This white paper argues that incorporating polarimetric capability into HWO instruments would significantly enhance the mission's scientific return. We highlight the unique opportunity for UK leadership in both instrument development and theoretical modelling, and advocate for a strong UK role in shaping HWO's polarimetric capabilities to maximise its impact on exoplanet science.",

Baselmans Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) DESHIMA (Deep Spectroscopic HIgh-redshift MApper) is a broadband integrated superconducting spectrometer (ISS) for millimeter (mm) / sub-millimeter (sub-mm) wave astronomy based on Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs). This paper describes characterization of DESHIMA 2.0 in laboratory settings. The instrument features NbTiN superconducting microstrip (MS) filters with low-loss a-SiC:H dielectric and an ultra-wideband leaky-wave antenna. A laboratory setup was designed, incorporating the cryostat housing cryogenic optics and ISS chip comprising 339 KIDs connected to MS filters tuned for (sub-)mm wave frequencies. Room-temperature mirrors on a hexapod stage allowed precise positioning and alignment of optical elements. The sky-position chopper was positioned on a motor-controlled stage for fine-tuned control over its position and alignment. Thanks to the multiplexing capability of KIDs, we could simultaneously measure multiple performance metrics across the entire frequency range. We showed that DESHIMA 2.0 achieved significant improvements in performance compared to its predecessor (DESHIMA 1.0): measured instantaneous frequency coverage was 200$-$400 GHz with a mean filter $Q_{filter}$ of $340 \\pm 50$; instrument efficiency reached $\\sim8$ \\%, indicating 4 times wider band coverage and 4 times higher sensitivity. The yield rate for MS filters exceeded 98 \\%. The estimated aperture efficiency from measured beam patterns agreed well with the designed value of approximately 70 \\%. The telescope far-field beam patterns calculated from measured beam patterns also exhibited good agreement with design specifications. We also demonstrated validity of a new method of absolute frequency calibration using the data from beam pattern measurement.",

Knuth Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Recent studies by B. Villarroel and colleagues have assembled and analyzed datasets of unidentified features measured from digital scans of photographic plates captured by the first-epoch Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS1) in the pre-Sputnik era. These studies have called attention to (i) a purported deficit of features within Earth's shadow; (ii) the sporadic presence of linear clusters; and (iii) a positive correlation between the timing of feature observations and nuclear tests as well as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) sighting reports. These observations were cited as evidence that some fraction of the unidentified features represent glinting artificial objects near Earth. We have examined these claims using two related, previously published datasets. When analyzing the most vetted of these, we do not observe the reported deficit in the terrestrial shadow. We determine that a third of the features in the reported linear clusters were not confidently distinguished from catalog stars. We find that the reported correlation between the timing of feature observations and nuclear tests becomes insignificant after properly normalizing by the number of observation days, and is almost completely determined by the observation schedule of the Palomar telescope. We uncover important inconsistencies in the definitions of the datasets used in these studies, as well as the use of unvalidated datasets containing catalog stars, scan artifacts, and plate defects. It has not been shown that any of the features in these datasets represent optical transients. We examine the spatial distribution of the plate-derived features, finding an overall gradual increase in number density toward the corners and edges of plates, as well as examples of (i) empty north-south strips that span multiple plates; (ii) clusters and voids having geometric shapes; and (iii) amorphous clusters.",

Cowan Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Targeted astrophysical surveys are limited by the amount of telescope time available, which makes it impossible to observe every single object of interest. In order to maximize the scientific return, we need a well thought strategy for selecting the observational targets, in our case exoplanets. This study evaluates various strategies for selecting exoplanet targets within limited observation windows, focusing specifically on the selection of exoplanet targets for Tier 2 transit spectroscopy with ESA's upcoming Ariel mission. We define three distinct selection criteria -- sample size, variance, and leverage -- and translate them into objective functions compatible with modern optimization algorithms. Specifically, we test five heuristics for maximizing sample leverage: leverage greedy, simulated annealing, K-means clustering, regular classes, and quantile classes. The performance of these methods is demonstrated through three practical exercises across one, two, and three parameters of diversity. Each criterion represents a unique trade-off between sample size, diversity, and total observation time. While a time-greedy approach maximizes the quantity of planets, it fails to capture diversity. Conversely, variance-greedy selection prioritizes diversity but introduces significant drawbacks: it oversamples rare cases and undersamples typical planets, ultimately reducing the total number of targets observed. Leverage-based selections emerge as the most effective middle ground, successfully balancing sample diversity with a robust sample size. This work supports the broader community effort to ensure that Ariel delivers the most diverse and scientifically valuable sample of exoplanet atmospheres within mission limits.",

Clarke, Gordon Yip, Nikolaos Nikolaou 14 pages, 12 figures, in review Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) In this paper we introduce PERTURB-c, a correlation-aware framework for interpreting black box regression models with one-dimensional structured inputs. We demonstrate this framework on a simulated case study with machine learning based transit spectroscopy retrievals of exoplanet WASP-107b. Characterising many exoplanet atmospheres can answer important questions about planetary populations, but traditional retrievals are very resource intensive; machine learning based methods offer a fast alternative however (i) they require high volumes data (only obtainable through simulations) to train and (ii) their complexity renders them black-boxes. Better understanding how they reach predictions can allow us to inspect for biases, which is especially important with simulated data, and verify that predictions are made on the basis of physically plausible features. This ultimately improves the ease of adoption of machine learning techniques. The most used methods to explain machine learning model predictions (such as SHAP and other methods that rely on stochastic sample generation) suffer from high computational complexity and struggle to account for interactions between inputs. PERTURB-c addresses these issues by leveraging physical knowledge of the known spectral correlation. For visualisation of this analysis, we propose a heat-map-based representation which is better suited to large numbers of input features along a single dimension, and that is more intuitive to those who are already familiar with retrieval methods. Note that while we chose this exoplanet retrieval context to demonstrate our methodologies, the PERTURB-c framework is model agnostic and in a broader context has potential value across a plethora of adjacent regression problems.",

Calculating Faraday depth, the most useful parameter for mapping the line-of-sight magnetic field, requires observations covering wide frequency bands with many channels. As part of the Global Magneto-Ionic Medium Survey (GMIMS), we have observed polarized emission spanning 350-1030 MHz over the northern sky, in the declination range ${-20^{\\circ}}\\leq{\\delta}\\leq{90^{\\circ}}$. We used the 15 m telescope at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO), equipped to receive orthogonal circular polarizations, with the Onsala Space Observatory band 1 feed developed for the SKA Project. Angular resolution varies across the band from $1.3^{\\circ}$ to $3.6^{\\circ}$. A digital spectrometer provided 42 kHz frequency resolution. Data were taken with the telescope moving rapidly in azimuth and are absolutely calibrated in intensity. Approximately 25% of the data were lost due to radio-frequency interference. The resolution in Faraday depth is $\\sim6$ rad m$^{-2}$, and features as wide as $\\sim38$ rad m$^{-2}$ are represented. The median sensitivity of the Faraday depth cube is 11 mK. Approximately 55% of sight-lines in this survey show Faraday complexity. This dataset, called ``DRAO GMIMS of the Northern Sky'' (DRAGONS), is the first to probe Faraday depth of the northern sky in its frequency range and will support many scientific investigations. The data will be used to calibrate surveys with higher angular resolution, particularly Galactic foreground maps from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment, and to provide information on large structures for aperture-synthesis telescopes, particularly the DRAO Synthesis Telescope. The data are available through the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre.",

Ultra-hot Jupiters serve as excellent targets for atmospheric characterization; studies of these planets may yield key understanding of gas giant's formation and evolution history. We present a thermal emission study of WASP-33 b's dayside atmosphere, based on two secondary eclipse observations with CFHT/WIRCam in two specific narrow band filters, namely the CO and CH4$_{\\rm on}$ filters, and archival data with HST/WFC3 and Spitzer. Stellar pulsations of the host star induce some quasi-periodic photometric variations, particularly in the CH4$_{\\rm on}$ band, which are modelled and corrected in the high-precision differential light curves. An eclipse depth of $1565.2^{+228.6}_{-237.5}$ ppm and $914.3^{+56.1}_{-57.0}$ ppm is determined for the CO and CH4$_{\\rm on}$ bands, respectively. Combined with HST/WFC3 and Spitzer data, our joint retrieval of WASP-33 b's dayside atmosphere reveals a high metallicity ([Fe/H] $= 1.52^{+0.35}_{-0.52}$), high C/O ratio (C/O $= 0.78^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$), and a thermal inversion layer, suggesting a formation history involving metal-rich gas accretion. We confirm the presence of the molecules H$_{2}$O, H$^{-}$ and CO, and report a tentative detection of TiO in the dayside atmosphere of WASP-33 b. Future higher precision observations with JWST may provide better understand constraints on the chemical abundances of oxygen and refractory element abundances to better WASP-33 b's formation and evolutionary pathway.",

Grimm 18 pages, 7 figures, in review in ApJ, comments welcome Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The observed masses and radii of sub-Neptunes can be explained by a variety of bulk compositions, with the two leading scenarios being the gas dwarf and the water world scenario. The evolutionary history of sub-Neptunes on a population level has been proposed as a method to distinguish between the possible bulk compositions. Previous evolutionary models, however, neglected the crucial role of chemical interactions between the atmosphere and interior. We present a novel evolution framework for sub-Neptunes that not only considers the thermal evolution but also takes the chemical coupling of atmosphere and interior into account. Using this model, we examine how planets formed inside and outside the ice line can be observationally distinguished. Young sub-Neptunes store the majority of their volatile budget in the interior, independent of formation location and thus initial composition. Nevertheless, the atmospheric metallicity is a factor 4 higher for the planet formed outside the ice line. As the planet cools, hydrogen and oxygen exsolve from the interior, leading to an increase in atmosphere mass fraction for both planets, counteracting the contraction due to cooling. Consequently, radius evolution alone cannot distinguish sub-Neptunes formed inside the water ice line from water-rich planets formed outside of it. Instead, a key discriminator is the abundance of carbon-bearing species and the resulting atmospheric C/O ratio. For water-rich sub-Neptunes formed outside the \\ice line, almost all carbon is in the gaseous phase. We find that high molar fractions of CH$_4$ ($\\>10^{-2}$) and H$_2$O ($> 5\\times10^{-2}$), and a high C/O ratio $(> 5\\times10^{-1})$ are indicative of formation outside the ice line. In contrast, sub-Neptunes formed inside the ice line exhibit strongly suppressed CH$_4$ abundances, yielding C/O ratios ranging widely from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-1}$. (Shortened version)",

Winter 5 pages, 4 figures, accepted as a letter to Astronomy and Astrophysics Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Twenty co-orbital asteroids of Venus are currently known, several of which may evolve into potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) over timescales of thousands of years. We report the identification and first dynamical characterization of 2025 TV$_{10}$, a newly discovered Venus co-orbital asteroid, and assess its potential collisional hazard to Earth. We performed numerical simulations of a large number of asteroid clones, and we studied their close encounters with Venus and Earth. The asteroid may leave its co-orbital orbit on timescales of 1200 yr. The orbit of 2025 TV$_{10}$ is one of the closest of the absolute minimum of the \"minimum orbital intersection distance\" (MOID) with Earth for the Venus co-orbital asteroids known to date. Owing to its orbital parameters, 2025 TV$_{10}$ represents one of the most dynamically hazardous members of the Venus co-orbital population identified to date. Its faint magnitude and restricted observability windows make future observations challenging but essential for constraining its orbit.",

We investigated the meteoroids of this shower using fireball data from the European Fireball Network supplemented by video data of faint meteors. We first derived the criteria for assigning meteors to this shower. A fragmentation model was then applied to selected shower fireballs with good deceleration data and light curves. Meteoroid fragmentation strengths and bulk densities were derived and compared with three other showers. We have confirmed the four year periodicity in the activity of eta-Virginids and their presence in the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter. The orbital period of four years was directly measured for the fireballs. Fainter meteors showed somewhat longer periods but the shower is poor in faint meteors. No member fainter than magnitude +1 was observed instrumentally. The physical properties of meteoroids are different from cometary streams and are similar to the Geminids. The limiting fragmentation strength of 0.5 MPa and typical bulk density of cm-sized meteoroids of 1500 kg/m3 suggest that the parent body is a carbonaceous asteroid. Besides Geminids, eta-Virginids is another stream of asteroidal origin. Some small meteoroids have densities around 2500 kg/m3. Three asteroids of the sizes between 40 - 120 meters have been found to have similar orbits but their relation to eta-Virginids remains uncertain.",

This is a coordinated pre-print submission with Parc et al. 2026 Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The Hidden Gems project searches the TESS data for additional planets transiting low-mass stars in confirmed systems. Our goal is to identify planet candidates that are below the detection threshold set by the SPOC and QLP pipelines using sherlock, a specialized pipeline for robust detection and vetting of transit signals in TESS data. We present the discovery of two inner rocky planets in the TOI-237 and TOI-4336 A systems, confirmed with ground-based photometry from the TRAPPIST, SPECULOOS, ExTrA, and LCO facilities. TOI-237 c has a radius of 1.21 +/- 0.04Re, orbits its mid-M host star every 1.74 days, and is close to a 3:1 mean-motion resonance with TOI-237 b. TOI-4336 A c has a radius of 1.17 +/- 0.06Re, and orbits with a period of 7.58 days an M3.5 host star which is part of a hierarchical triple system. We performed model comparison to search for non-zero eccentricities, and found that the circular transit models are statistically favored. Dynamical simulations show that both systems are in stable configurations, and the TTVs expected for the TOI-237 system are of the order of seconds. TOI-237 c and TOI-4336 A c join the high-interest population of warm likely super-Earths below the so-called \"radius valley\". In particular, TOI-237 c is a good candidate for phase curve observations with JWST/MIRI thanks to the small radius of the host star and its short period.",

This study re-analyzes the visible and near-infrared reflectance spectrum of Kamo`oalewa published by B. N. L. Sharkey et al. (2021), obtained using the Large Binocular Telescope, to infer its mineral composition and space weathering characteristics. Spectral similarity analysis is performed by comparing the spectrum of Kamo`oalewa to the mean spectra of various types in the Bus-DeMeo taxonomy to make a preliminary constraint on the combined characteristics of surface mineralogy and space weathering effects. To further characterize the mineral composition, a detailed analysis of the 1 {\\mu}m band center is conducted based on spectral data below 1.25 {\\mu}m that have higher signal-to-noise ratios. Empirical models for normalized spectra are developed to estimate the Is/FeO content. The results suggest that asteroid Kamo`oalewa has higher olivine abundance than that of typical S-type asteroids and the Moon, exhibiting an immature to submature degree of space weathering. These findings enhance our understanding of the evolution of similar quasi-satellites and provide important implication for the future exploration of Tianwen-2 mission.",

Full abstract in the article Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We present the characterization of two planetary systems orbiting the M dwarfs TOI-4336 A (M3.5V) and TOI-4342 (M0V), each hosting two transiting planets previously validated with TESS and ground-based observations. We refined the photometry of the TOI-4342 system using TESS and LCOGT data, and characterized the host stars with NIRPS and ESPRESSO spectroscopy. High-precision ESPRESSO radial velocities allowed us to constrain the planetary masses and investigate their potential compositions. The TOI-4336 A system is composed of a sub-Neptune with a period of 16.34 days, a radius of $2.14 \\pm 0.08$ Re, and a mass of $3.33 \\pm 0.36$ Me, along with an inner super-Earth on a 7.59-day orbit with a radius of $1.25 \\pm 0.07$ Re and a mass of $1.55 \\pm 0.13$ Me. The TOI-4342 system hosts two sub-Neptunes of similar sizes ($2.33 \\pm 0.09$ Re and $2.35 \\pm 0.09$ Re), with periods of 5.54 and 10.69 days. Their masses are measured to be $7.3 \\pm 1.3$ Me and $4.8 \\pm 1.4$ Me, respectively. The RVs also reveal a planet candidate around TOI-4342, likely non-transiting, with a period of 47.5 days and a minimum mass of $17.8 \\pm 3.0$ Me. With precise radii and masses, we derived bulk densities and explored possible compositions. The TOI-4336 A sub-Neptune and super-Earth have densities of $1.87 \\pm 0.30$ and $4.35 \\pm 0.79$ g cm$^{-3}$, while the two similar-sized sub-Neptunes in TOI-4342 show distinct densities of $3.18 \\pm 0.67$ and $2.01 \\pm 0.63$ g cm$^{-3}$. All four planets are excellent targets for future atmospheric characterization with JWST, and their multi-planet nature makes them especially interesting for comparative planetology. Notably, TOI-4336 A b stands out as one of the best-known targets in its size and temperature regime, with a TSM of 138, comparable to benchmark planets such as K2-18 b and LHS 1140 b.",

High-pressure torsion (HPT) is an innovative method with which to simulate the extreme conditions of astronomical impacts and offers insights relevant to prebiotic chemistry. In the present study, we investigated the polymerization and stability of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), a key precursor to ribonucleic acid (RNA), in dry and hydrated conditions (10 wt% water) under 6 GPa at ambient and boiling water temperatures. Comprehensive analyses with the use of X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, scanning electron microscopy, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed no evidence of polymerization, while AMP partly transformed to other organic compounds such as nucleobase-derived fragments of adenine, phosphoribose fragments, dehydrated adenosine, protonated adenosine, and oxidized adenosine. The torque measurements during HPT further highlight the mechanical behavior of AMP under extreme conditions. These findings suggest that, while HPT under the conditions tested does not facilitate polymerization, the formation of various compounds from AMP confirms the significance of astronomical impacts on the prebiotic chemistry of RNA on early Earth.

Buchhave The Astrophysical Journal Letters, Volume 996, Number 2, 2026 Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Detection of an atmosphere around a terrestrial exoplanet will be a major milestone in the field, but our observational capacities are biased towards to tidally locked, close-in planets orbiting M-dwarf stars. The atmospheres of these planets are vulnerable to atmospheric erosion and collapse due to condensation of volatiles on the nightside. However, these collapsed volatiles accumulated as nightside ice constitute a stable reservoir that could be re-vaporised by meteorite impacts and re-establish the atmospheres. Through a simple energy balance model applied to atmospheric evolution simulations with stochastic impacts, we assess the viability and importance of this mechanism for CO$_2$ atmospheres. We find that moderate-sized impactors ($5-10 \\rm{km}$ diameter) occurring at a frequency of $1-100 \\rm{Gyr}^{-1}$ can regenerate observable transient atmospheres on previously airless planets. We focus on specific targets from the JWST DDT Rocky Worlds programme, and compute the fraction of their evolution spent with a transient CO$_2$ atmosphere generated through this mechanism. We find this fraction can reach $70\\%$ for GJ 3929 b, $50\\%$ for LTT 1445 Ac, $80\\%$ for LTT 1445 Ab, at high impact rates and strong CO$_2$ outgassing over the planet's lifetime. We also show that atmospheric collapse can shield volatiles from escape, particularly in the early, high-XUV phase of M-dwarf evolution. Overall, our work suggests that terrestrial planet atmospheres may not evolve monotonically but instead may be shaped by episodic external forcings.",

The two first authors contributed equally to this manuscript Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Understanding the climates of terrestrial exoplanets and the detectability of biosignatures is an inherently interdisciplinary challenge, requiring the integration of insights from Solar System exploration, exoplanet observations and climate science. Building from Earth as the only known inhabited planet, NCCR PlanetS has developed models, tools and observational strategies to assess planetary environments far beyond direct reach. Between 2018 and 2025, PlanetS made major contributions across theory, modelling, instrumentation and mission preparation. On the modelling side, the Generic Planetary Climate Model enabled climate studies across a wide range of planetary regimes, from early Venus to temperate terrestrial exoplanets including Proxima b, incorporating advanced developments such as a dynamical slab ocean. In parallel, the THOR global climate model was developed to avoid Earth-centric assumptions and to stably simulate diverse atmospheric regimes. PlanetS has also advanced atmospheric retrieval techniques combining forward modelling, Bayesian inference and machine learning, applied to targets ranging from Solar System bodies to exoplanet phase curves and directly imaged spectra. These efforts have helped assess the scientific return of future missions, notably the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) and to define instrumental requirements for detecting Earth-like atmospheres and biosignatures. Within the Solar System, PlanetS contributed key technologies for biosignature detection, including ORIGIN and SenseLife, enabling in-situ and remote detection of organics, isotopic ratios and microstructures. Finally, PlanetS has played a major role in preparing the next generation of observatories, from JWST, VLT and ELT instruments to LIFE and the Habitable Worlds Observatory. Together, these contributions form an integrated framework advancing the search for life beyond Earth.",
