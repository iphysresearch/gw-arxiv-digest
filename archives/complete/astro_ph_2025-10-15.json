      "abstract": "Elusive Plunges and Heavy Intermediate-mass-ratio Inspirals from Single and Binary Supermassive Black Holes Lazaros Souvaitzis, Antti Rantala, Thorsten Naab Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The most massive galaxies in the Universe also host the largest supermassive black holes (SMBHs), with masses of $10^9 \\: \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ and above. During their hierarchical assembly, these galaxies have experienced only a few major mergers at low redshift, but have accreted many low-mass galaxies across cosmic time, possibly hosting intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs). If some of these IMBHs migrate to the galactic center, they may form compact subsystems around the central SMBH. We investigate the evolution of such subsystems, consisting of ten $10^5 \\: \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ IMBHs at three different concentrations around a $10^9 \\: \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ SMBH. We evolve these systems both in isolation and in the presence of a companion SMBH, using \\texttt{MSTAR}, a regularized integration method including relativistic effects up to post-Newtonian order 3.5PN. Our analysis focuses on gravitational--wave--driven intermediate--mass--ratio inspirals (heavy IMRIs) and direct plunges. We show that perturbations from a secondary SMBH enhance the number of IMBH direct plunges by more than a factor of two, making them the dominant merger channel. These plunges and IMRIs with a central $10^9 \\: \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ SMBH will contribute to SMBH growth but will likely evade detection with future gravitational-wave interferometers and pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). However, for galaxies with lower--mass SMBHs ($M_\\bullet \\lesssim 10^8 \\:\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$), heavy IMRIs will be detectable with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and can provide direct observational constraints on the existence of IMBHs, while the more numerous plunges will still remain hidden.",

Metzger 20 pages, 11 figures + Appendix High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Binaries in which a massive donor star undergoes an extended ($\\gtrsim$ kyr) phase of stable mass transfer onto a black hole (BH) accretor offer a promising channel for creating LIGO gravitational wave sources. However, in many systems the mass transfer terminates prematurely in a dynamical instability at orbital periods of a few days, culminating in the BH plunging into the donor and potentially disrupting and accreting its helium core at highly super-Eddington rates. Combining a suite of binary evolution models with analytic estimates and population synthesis, we predict the population of luminous transients from delayed dynamical instability (DDI) and attribute them to the \"luminous\" class of fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs). The initial plunge of the BH into the partially stripped envelope typically ejects $\\sim 10M_{\\odot}$ of H/He-enriched material at speeds $\\sim 10^{2}-10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$, generating a compact circumstellar medium (CSM) of radius $\\lesssim 1000R_{\\odot}$ by the time the BH meets and tidally disrupts the HeC. Rapid BH accretion generates a highly aspherical wind-driven explosion into the environment, powering UV/optical emission via CSM interaction and X-ray reprocessing that rises over a few days to a luminosity $\\sim 10^{44}-10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ before fading as the disk spreads outwards and accretion rate drops. Luminous radio/sub-mm emission is generated over several months as the jet collides with the slow quasi-spherical binary outflow, generated by the stable mass transfer preceding DDI, extending to radii $\\sim 10^{17}$ cm, in agreement with the inferred CSM environments of LFBOTs. We estimate local rates of DDI merger transients $5-300$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, with a preference for low-metallicities, in agreement with LFBOT demographics. Taken together, our results support LFBOTs as being luminous signposts of \"failed\" gravitational wave sources.",

The goal is to evaluate and synthesize existing research to identify effective methodologies, highlight gaps, and propose future research directions. Our review identifies several key findings: (1) various machine learning techniques, including Bayesian neural networks, Gaussian processes, and deep learning models, have been applied to cosmological data analysis, improving parameter estimation and handling large datasets. However, models achieving significant computational speedups often exhibit worse confidence regions compared to traditional methods, emphasizing the need for future research to enhance both efficiency and measurement precision. (2) Traditional cosmological methods, such as those using Type Ia Supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and cosmic microwave background data, remain fundamental, but most studies focus narrowly on specific datasets. We recommend broader dataset usage to fully validate alternative cosmological models. (3) The reviewed studies mainly address the $H_0$ tension, leaving other cosmological challenges-such as the cosmological constant problem, warm dark matter, phantom dark energy, and others-unexplored. (4) Hybrid methodologies combining machine learning with Markov chain Monte Carlo offer promising results, particularly when machine learning techniques are used to solve differential equations, such as Einstein Boltzmann solvers, as prior to Markov chain Monte Carlo models, accelerating computations while maintaining precision. (5) There is a significant need for standardized evaluation criteria and methodologies, as variability in training processes and experimental setups complicates result comparability and reproducibility (abridged).",

It was only with the advent of Event Horizon Telescope observations that the predictions of this hypothesis could be observationally tested for our own Galaxy, and the nearby elliptical M87, on spatial scales comparable to the gravitational radius. At the same time it became possible to test whether alternatives such as naked singularities in general relativity, or similar objects in alternative theories of gravity, are excluded by the data. These and other observational developments renewed interest in non-Kerr spacetime metrics, also in the context of active galactic nuclei at cosmological distances. Recently, we have shown that accreting naked singularities in the Reissner-Nordström metric of general relativity tend to produce strong outflows. The geometry and origin of these winds is studied here, and their parameter dependence is investigated. To this end we performed numerical GR hydrodynamical simulations of accretion of electrically neutral matter in the Reissner-Nordström metric and discussed the results in the context of analytic predictions of fluid motion in this spacetime.",

In this Letter, we present the first study of thermal deformations in super-Eddington magnetized NSs with column accretion, where magnetic fields induce anisotropic heat conduction that leads to crustal temperature asymmetries. We compute the resulting mass quadrupole moments and estimate the associated CGW strain amplitudes. Our results show that Galactic magnetized NSs undergoing super-Eddington column accretion can emit detectable CGWs in upcoming observatories. Assuming a 2-yr coherent integration, the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer could detect such CGW signals from rapidly spinning NSs with spin periods $P \\lesssim 20\\,\\rm ms$, while the LIGO O5 run may detect systems with $P \\lesssim 6 \\,{\\rm ms}$. These findings suggest that super-Eddington magnetized NSs could represent a new class of CGW sources, providing a unique opportunity to probe the NS crust and bridge accretion physics with GW astronomy.",

In this work, we perform a comprehensive analysis by utilizing the latest DESI DR2 BAO data in conjunction with CMB data from ACT, SPT, Planck, and WMAP, along with SN data from PantheonPlus and DESY5. We consider four interacting dark energy (IDE) models with different forms of the interaction term $Q$. Our analysis indicates that CMB experiments other than Planck enhance the evidence for an interaction in the IDE models with $Q \\propto \\rho_{\\rm de}$. In particular, when using the SPT+DESI+DESY5 data, the IDE model with $Q = \\beta H_0 \\rho_{\\rm de}$ gives $\\beta = -0.4170 \\pm 0.1220$, with a deviation from zero reaching $3.4\\sigma$ level. When replacing DESY5 with PantheonPlus, this deviation weakens to $2.1\\sigma$ level, but remains relatively significant. Furthermore, the Bayes factors of the IDE model with $Q = \\beta H_0 \\rho_{\\rm de}$ are positive in all cases, providing a moderate-to-strong preference over $\\Lambda$CDM. Overall, our comprehensive analysis clearly suggests that the IDE models with $Q \\propto \\rho_{\\rm de}$ (especially, $Q = \\beta H_0 \\rho_{\\rm de}$) provide strong evidence supporting the existence of interaction and are more preferred by the current cosmological data.",

On large scales, galaxy velocities follow Hubble's law, but within groups and clusters local gravitational effects introduce significant departures from linearity. Using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations, we investigate whether dark energy leaves detectable imprints on the local velocity-radius relation. We model the kinematics with extensions of the Lemaitre-Tolman framework and apply Bayesian inference to recover halo masses and the Hubble constant H0. The fits reveal systematic biases: halo masses are underestimated with a median ratio $M_{fit}/M_{true} = 0.95 \\pm 0.28$, while the inferred Hubble constant clusters around $H_0 = 64 \\pm 16 km/s/Mpc$, compared to the simulation input of 67.74. This corresponds to an average 25\\% uncertainty in H0 recovery from the local flow method. While the mass and expansion rate can be constrained, different model variants whether including angular momentum, friction, or altered radial scaling-remain statistically indistinguishable. Our results highlight both the promise and the limitations of using local kinematics as a precision probe of dark energy.",

Their formation is usually attributed to large positive curvature perturbations, which collapse upon Hubble re-entry during radiation domination. In this work we investigate instead the role of negative curvature perturbations, corresponding to the growth of primordial void (PV) like regions. Using numerical relativity simulations, we show that sufficiently deep PV can undergo a nonlinear rebounce at the center, generating an effective overdensity that eventually collapses into a PBH. We determine the critical threshold for this process for a variety of equations of state, and demonstrate that the resulting black holes obey a scaling relation analogous to the standard overdensity case. These results establish primordial voids as a novel channel for PBH formation and highlight their potential impact on PBH abundances and cosmological signatures.",

We simulate GW events assuming a data-driven distribution of binary parameters for the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) fourth and fifth observing runs (O4 and O5). We map the binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) properties to the kilonova optical light curves. We use the simulated population of kilonovae to generate follow-up observing plans, with the primary goal of optimizing detection with the Gravitational Wave Multi-Messenger Astronomy DECam Survey (GW-MMADS). We explore the dependence of kilonova detectability on the mass, distance, inclination, and spin of the binaries. Assuming that no BNS was detected during O4 until the end of 2024, we present updated GW BNS (NSBH) merger detection rates. We expect to detect BNS (NSBH) kilonovae with DECam at a per-year rate of: $0$-$2.0$ ($0$) in O4, and $2.0$-$19$ ($0$-$1.0$) in O5. We expect the majority of BNS detections and also those accompanied by a detectable kilonova to produce a hypermassive NS remnant, with a significant fraction of the remaining BNSs promptly collapsing to a BH.

We explore the response of astrometric measurements to a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in synergy with PTA data. Analytical, covariant expressions for this response are derived, accounting for the presence of a possible dipolar anisotropy in the SGWB. We identify the optimal estimator for extracting SGWB information from astrometric observations and examine how sensitivity to SGWB properties varies with the sky positions of stars and pulsars. Using representative examples of current PTA capabilities and near-future astrometric sensitivity, we demonstrate that cross-correlating astrometric and PTA data can improve constraints on SGWB properties, compared to PTA data alone. The improvement is quantified through Fisher forecasts for the SGWB amplitude, spectral tilt, and dipolar anisotropy amplitude. In the future, such joint constraints could play a crucial role in identifying the origin of SGWB signals detected by PTAs.",

The BCO phase space provides a robust and data-driven approach to discover the likely formation scenarios of these binaries. In this study, we expand the previously introduced binary black hole phase space technique to encompass low-mass compact objects (LMCOs), establishing a novel framework to investigate their diverse formation mechanisms. Applying this approach to selected low-mass events $(\\lesssim 5 M_\\odot)$ from the GWTC-3 catalog and the recently observed GW230529 event, we show for the first time the phase space demonstration of the LMCOs and find the associated probabilities for different formation scenarios including neutron star, astrophysical black hole, or primordial black hole. Our analysis includes the astrophysical modelling uncertainties in and how it causes degeneracy between different formation scenarios. In future, with improvements in GW detector sensitivity and with detection of more GW events, the LMCO phase space framework will significantly strengthen our capacity to associate more likely formation scenarios over the other, thereby refining our understanding of compact object formation for both astrophysical and primordial scenarios, and its evolution across the cosmic redshift.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nanohertz (nHz) regime, detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), provides a promising probe of the cosmic population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). These binaries are expected to retain significant eccentricity throughout their evolution. We present a new technique to model the nHz SGWB by incorporating eccentricity into a multi-scale adaptive simulation framework. Using the time-domain eccentric waveform model ESIGMAHM, we generate realistic GW signals from astrophysical populations of SMBHBs. Unlike circular binaries, eccentric systems emit across multiple frequencies, introducing spectral correlations between frequency bins. These correlations provide a novel observational signature of the eccentricity distribution of the SMBHB population. In this work, we adopt simplified power-law models for the eccentricity distribution. While this does not capture the full complexity of galactic environments, it effectively highlights the key features of GW emission from eccentric binaries and their imprint on the SGWB. Our approach advances nHz GW signal modeling by incorporating eccentricity at small scales, enabling more realistic predictions and offering a new avenue for probing SMBHB astrophysics with future PTA observations.",

The GUP modifications to the Friedmann equations and cosmological perturbation parameters are employed to assess the model observational viability against the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data.

Nevertheless, black holes possess a central singularity, considered unphysical, and an event horizon, which leads to loss of unitarity in a quantum description of the system. To address these theoretical inconsistencies, alternative models, collectively known as exotic compact objects, have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the potential detectability of signatures associated with non-rotating exotic compact objects within the Sgr~A* polarized flares dataset, as observed through GRAVITY and future instruments. We examine a total of eight distinct metrics, originating from four different categories of static and spherically symmetric compact objects: Black Holes, Boson stars, Fluid spheres, and Gravastars. Our approach involves utilizing a toy model that orbits the compact object in the equatorial plane, at the Schwarzschild-Keplerian velocity. Using simulated astrometric and polarimetric data with present GRAVITY and future GRAVITY+ uncertainties, we fit the datasets across all metrics examined. We evaluated the detectability of the metric for each dataset based on the resulting $\\chi^2_\\mathrm{red}$ and BIC-based Bayes factors. Plunge-through images of ECOs affect polarization and astrometry. With GRAVITY's present uncertainties, only a compact boson-star model is discernible. GRAVITY+'s improved sensitivity allows detection of most exotic compact object models. However, enhancing the astrophysical complexity of the hot spot model diminishes these outcomes. Presently, GRAVITY's uncertainties limit us to detecting just one exotic compact object metric. With GRAVITY+'s enhanced sensitivity, we can expect to uncover additional exotic compact object models and use Sgr~A* as a laboratory for fundamental physics.",

Today's mirror stabilization control injects harmful noise, constituting a major obstacle to sensitivity improvements. We eliminated this noise through Deep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning method using frequency domain rewards. We proved our methodology on the LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO). Our controller reduced control noise in the 10--30Hz band by over 30x, and up to 100x in sub-bands surpassing the design goal motivated by the quantum limit.

In this work, we address the tension between early JWST observations of luminous high-redshift galaxies and predictions of the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model by revisiting the physics of dark matter halo formation. Employing refined halo mass functions derived by Del Popolo \\textit{et al.} (DP1 and DP2) that incorporate angular momentum, dynamical friction, and redshift-dependent collapse barriers, we demonstrate a significant enhancement in the abundance of massive halos at $z \\gtrsim 7$ compared to the conventional Sheth-Tormen (ST) formalism. Using a semi-empirical framework linking halo mass to UV luminosity, we show that the DP2 model reproduces the observed UV luminosity functions from $z = 7$ to $14$ with moderate star formation efficiencies, whereas the ST model requires implausibly high efficiencies. Our results suggest that the JWST overabundance problem stems not from new physics beyond $\\Lambda$CDM, but from oversimplified treatments of gravitational collapse, highlighting the critical role of small-scale dissipative dynamics in early structure formation.",

In this work, we revisit the quantum-corrected Higgs inflation scenario within the framework of a non-minimally coupled scalar field theory. Starting from the one-loop effective action, we incorporate radiative corrections through the anomalous scaling parameter ${\\bf A_I}$ and derive analytic expressions for the inflationary observables $n_s$ and $r$ in the Einstein frame. Our analysis demonstrates that quantum corrections naturally shift $n_s$ toward higher values while keeping the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ suppressed. For ${\\cal N} = 60$, the model predicts $n_s \\simeq 0.9743$ and $r \\simeq 5.4\\times10^{-3}$, in excellent agreement with the latest ACT+DESI (P-ACT-LB) data and fully consistent with the \\textit{Planck}~2018 limit $r < 0.036$.

Minasyan Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Recent measurements of the mean free path (MFP) of ionizing photons at $z=6$ find that it is significantly shorter than extrapolations from lower $z$. This has a substantial impact on the topology of reionization and thus the prospects of tomography of the 21-cm signal from upcoming radio interferometers. In this work we develop the first analytic model of reionization which explicitly incorporates the MFP as a free parameter, allowing us to transparently explore its effect on the process. Our model is based on the excursion set formalism with an ionization condition which accounts for absorptions parameterized through the MFP. With the goal of observational comparison, we include additional modifications which make our model particularly suitable for predicting one-point statistics of the ionization field (and 21-cm signal), which are among the fundamental quantities for tomography. We find that the effect of the MFP is much more significant during the later stages of reionization, and that including a shorter MFP reduces the size of HII regions by around an order of magnitude towards the end of reionization compared with analytic models which do not account for the MFP. We find that the reported MFP value produces a contrast in the 21-cm signal of $\\mathcal{O}$(1 mK) or less at resolutions $\\theta \\sim $ 15--35 arcmin, an order of magnitude below naive estimates and up to a factor of several smaller than when using a larger MFP value extrapolated from low $z$, requiring significantly more sensitivity for imaging. We compare the contrast to noise estimates for arrays similar in size to HERA and SKA-Low and find that SKA has sufficient sensitivity for direct imaging (at the largest scales considered), while the predicted signal will be challenging for arrays similar in size to HERA. Our model indicates that more detailed sensitivity estimates are warranted in the context of a short MFP.",

Broxterman, Matthieu Schaller, Joop Schaye Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The scattering transform is a wavelet-based statistic capable of capturing non-Gaussian features in weak lensing (WL) convergence maps and has been proven to tighten cosmological parameter constraints by accessing information beyond two-point functions. However, its application in cosmological inference requires a clear understanding of its sensitivity to astrophysical systematics, the most significant of which are baryonic effects. These processes substantially modify the matter distribution on small to intermediate scales ($k\\gtrsim 0.1\\,h\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), leaving scale-dependent imprints on the WL convergence field. We systematically examine the impact of baryonic feedback on scattering coefficients using full-sky WL convergence maps with Stage IV survey characteristics, generated from the FLAMINGO simulation suite. These simulations include a broad range of feedback models, calibrated to match the observed cluster gas fraction and galaxy stellar mass function, including systematically shifted variations, and incorporating either thermal or jet-mode AGN feedback. We characterise baryonic effects using a baryonic transfer function defined as the ratio of hydrodynamical to dark-matter-only scattering coefficients. While the coefficients themselves are sensitive to both cosmology and feedback, the transfer function remains largely insensitive to cosmology and shows a strong response to feedback, with suppression reaching up to $10\\%$ on scales of $k\\gtrsim 0.1\\,h\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. We also demonstrate that shape noise significantly diminishes the sensitivity of the scattering coefficients to baryonic effects, reducing the suppression from $\\sim 2 - 10 \\;\\%$ to $\\sim 1\\;\\%$, even with 1.5 arcmin Gaussian smoothing. This highlights the need for noise mitigation strategies and high-resolution data in future WL surveys.",

Mota 8 figures and 4 tables, accepted for publication in APJ Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) This study explores the possibility of a time-varying dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) deviating from -1. We employ a comprehensive dataset of usual astronomical probes (Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, Hubble data, and Planck 2018 CMB) alongside future mock gravitational wave (GW) distance measurements from the Einstein Telescope. We utilize the Pad'e approximation, a versatile framework encompassing well-known DE models like constant EoS, Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization and other time-evolving DE parametrizations. Within Pad'e parametrization, we examine three specific forms (Pad'e-I, SPad'e-I, Pad'e-II) applied to both spatially flat and non-flat universes. Pad'e-II exhibits particularly interesting features in terms of the evidence of dynamical DE at many standard deviations. Our results can be summarized as follows. Flat Universe: When analyzing the combined dataset of standard probes (including CMB) with Pad'e-II in a flat universe, we find a strong preference (6.4{\\sigma}) for a dynamical (time-varying) DE EoS. This preference remains significant (4.7{\\sigma}) even when incorporating future GW data. Non-Flat Universe: In a non-flat universe, the combined standard datasets (without or with CMB) also indicate dynamical DE EoS at a high confidence level (6.2{\\sigma} and 6.4{\\sigma}, respectively). The addition of GW data slightly reduces the evidence (3.8{\\sigma} and 5.1{\\sigma}, respectively), but the preference persists. These results collectively suggest a robust case for dynamical DE in the dark sector. While a non-flat universe is not strongly favored, Pad'e-II hints at a possible closed universe when CMB data is included (with or without GW data).",

Submitted to A&A Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Extracting cosmological information from the Euclid galaxy survey will require modelling numerous systematic effects during the inference process. This implies varying a large number of nuisance parameters, which have to be marginalised over before reporting the constraints on the cosmological parameters. This is a delicate process, especially with such a large parameter space, which could result in biased cosmological results. In this work, we study the impact of different choices for modelling systematic effects and prior distribution of nuisance parameters for the final Euclid Data Release, focusing on the 3$\\times$2pt analysis for photometric probes and the galaxy power spectrum multipoles for the spectroscopic probes. We explore the effect of intrinsic alignments, linear galaxy bias, magnification bias, multiplicative cosmic shear bias and shifts in the redshift distribution for the photometric probes, as well as the purity of the spectroscopic sample. We find that intrinsic alignment modelling has the most severe impact with a bias up to $6\\,\\sigma$ on the Hubble constant $H_0$ if neglected, followed by mis-modelling of the redshift evolution of galaxy bias, yielding up to $1.5\\,\\sigma$ on the parameter $S_8\\equiv\\sigma_8\\sqrt{\\Omega_{\\rm m} /0.3}$. Choosing a too optimistic prior for multiplicative bias can also result in biases of the order of $0.7\\,\\sigma$ on $S_8$. We also find that the precision on the estimate of the purity of the spectroscopic sample will be an important driver for the constraining power of the galaxy clustering full-shape analysis. These results will help prioritise efforts to improve the modelling and calibration of systematic effects in Euclid.",

We show that PMFs can significantly speed up the formation and destruction of the first molecules, leading to an increase in the number density of H$_2$ and HD molecules and a decrease in the number density of HeH$^+$ ion-molecules compared to the case without PMFs. We demonstrate that more frequent collisions of the gas particles in such models alter the ortho-to-para ratio of hydrogen molecules, making it a potential probe of the thermal history of gas in the early Universe. In contrast to the standard cosmological model, where the global signal from the first molecules appears as an absorption feature in the cosmic microwave background spectrum, cosmological models with PMFs can produce an emission signal. Specifically, for non-helical PMFs with $n_B = -2.9$ and a strength of $\\sim 1$~nG, the signal transforms into emission with an amplitude of about $\\sim 0.5$~Jy/sr. This signal is comparable in magnitude to other known CMB spectral distortions and falls within the detection capabilities of several proposed missions, including Super-PIXIE, Multi-SIMBAD (4 units), and Voyage2050. We show that both the amplitude and the spectral range of the global signals from the first molecules are highly sensitive to the spectral index $n_B$, the strength $B_0$, and the helicity of the PMFs. Therefore, the global signals from the first molecules can serve as a potential probe of PMFs.",

      "abstract": "Constranits of dynamical dark energy models from different observational datasets Peiyuan Xu, Lu Chen, Guohao Li, Yang Han Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The measurements of baryon acoustic oscillation by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 indicate that dark energy may be a dynamical quantity with a time-varying equation of state. This challenges the core assumptions of the $\\Lambda$CDM model and has generated significant interest in dynamical dark energy models. Therefore, studying the parameterization of the equation of state for dynamical dark energy is crucial. Existing work has achieved fruitful results in the dark energy models, exploring various parameterization forms, but it is relatively scattered and lacks systematic parameter constraints based on the latest dataset combinations. We use the $\\Lambda$CDM as a baseline model and carry out rigorous statistical constraints on key cosmological parameters for seven representative parameterization models. Planck PR4 and DESI DR2 observations are incorporated into our study. We use three dataset combinations: CMB+BAO+PantheonPlus, CMB+BAO+DES-Y5, and CMB+BAO+Union3. The ${H}_{0}$ and ${\\sigma }_{8}$ values of all dynamical dark energy models are lower than the $\\Lambda$CDM model, indicating that our results may not effectively alleviate ${H}_{0}$ tension, but can significantly reduce ${\\sigma }_{8}$ tension. By comparing the $\\chi^2$ and the Akaike Information Criterion obtained for each model, we demonstrate that the linear Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterization model is not the optimal choice in all cases. Specifically, when combined with the CMB+BAO+DES-Y5 dataset, the Barboza-Alcaniz, Logarithmic, and Exponential models demonstrate superior statistical fitting performance compared to the $\\Lambda$CDM model. The Barboza-Alcaniz model shows a great advantage in fitting performance, leading to the most significant improvement.",

Strauss 22 pages, 14 figures, published in the ApJ Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present an algorithm designed to identify galaxy (proto)clusters in wide-area photometric surveys by first selecting their dominant galaxy-i.e., the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) or protoBCG-through the local stellar mass density traced by massive galaxies. We focus on its application to the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) Wide Survey to detect candidates up to $\\rm z \\sim 2$. In this work, we apply the method to mock galaxy catalogs that replicate the observational constraints of the HSC-SSP Wide Survey. We derive functions that describe the probability of a massive galaxy being the dominant galaxy in a structure as a function of its stellar mass density contrast within a given redshift interval. We show that galaxies with probabilities greater than 50\\% yield a sample of BCGs/protoBCGs with $\\gtrsim 65\\%$ purity, where most of the contamination arises from galaxies in massive groups below our cluster threshold. Using the same threshold, the resulting (proto)cluster sample achieves 80\\% purity and 50\\% completeness for halos with $M_{\\rm{halo}} \\geq 10^{14} \\ M_{\\odot}$, reaching nearly 100\\% completeness for $M_{\\rm{halo}} \\geq 10^{14.5} \\ M_{\\odot}$. We also assign probabilistic membership to surrounding galaxies based on stellar mass and distance to the dominant galaxy, from which we define the cluster richness as the number of galaxies more likely to be true members than contaminants. This allows us to derive a halo mass-richness relation.

Probabilistic criteria based on proximity to the candidate central galaxy and the expected stellar mass of member galaxies are applied to identify likely members of each structure. We produced updated photometric redshift estimates using deep learning methods trained on a dataset combining spectroscopic redshifts from the HSC-SSP Wide PDR3, high-accuracy photometric redshifts from the COSMOS2020 catalog, and mid-infrared data from the unWISE catalog for matched sources. Our method achieves a predicted purity of $\\sim 90\\%$ in detecting (proto)clusters, with $\\gtrsim 65\\%$ correctly identifying the (proto)BCG.

We employ an adjusted implementation of GALLUMI combined with the modified Boltzmann solver CLASS DMeff that accounts for interacting DM, and incorporate UVLF data from both blank and lensed HST fields, alongside Planck CMB data and the Pantheon supernova catalog in a Bayesian analysis framework to set constraints on $\\sigma_0$. Our results show that including lensed UVLF data, which probe fainter galaxies than the blank HST fields and thus smaller scales, leads to a substantial improvement in the constraints on $\\sigma_0$ for $n>0$, surpassing existing bounds from Milky-Way (MW) satellite abundance and CMB anisotropies.

      "abstract": "Fast radio bursts shed light on direct gravity test on cosmological scales Shuren Zhou, Pengjie Zhang Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) A key measure of gravity is the relation between the Weyl potential $\\Psi+\\Phi$ and the matter overdensity $\\delta_m$, capsulized as an effective gravitational constant $G_{\\rm light}$ for light motion. Its value, together with the possible spatial and temporal variation, is essential in probing physics beyond Einstein gravity. However, the lack of an unbiased proxy of $\\delta_m$ prohibits direct measurement of $G_{\\rm light}$. We point out that the equivalence principle ensures the dispersion measure (DM) of localized fast radio bursts (FRBs) as a good proxy of $\\delta_m$. We further propose a FRB-based method $F_G$ to directly measure $G_{\\rm light}$, combining galaxy-DM of localized FRBs and galaxy-weak lensing cross-correlations. The measurement, with a conservative cut $k\\leq 0.1h$/Mpc, can achieve a precision of $\\lesssim 10\\% \\sqrt{10^5/N_{\\rm FRB}}$ over 10 equal-width redshift bins at $z\\lesssim 1$.

We find that when the frequency $\\omega$ of transverse waves is much smaller than the collision frequency $\\nu_c$ of the intergalactic plasma, the conversion of ALPs into photons occurs on timescales far longer than the age of the Universe, ensuring stability of the star.

Robotham Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The Wide-Area VISTA Extragalactic Survey (WAVES) on the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) includes two flux-limited subsurveys with very high (95\\%) completeness requirements: Wide over $\\sim\\!1200$ deg$^2$ and Deep over $\\sim\\!65$ deg$^2$. Both are $Z$-band selected, respectively as $Z<21.1$ and $Z<21.25$ mag, and additionally redshift-limited, while the true redshifts are not known a priori but will be only measured by 4MOST. Here, we present a classification-based method to select the targets for WAVES-Wide. Rather than estimating individual redshifts for the input photometric objects, we assign probabilities of them being below $z=0.2$, the redshift limit of the subsurvey. This is done with the supervised machine learning approach of eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), trained on a comprehensive spectroscopic sample overlapping with WAVES fields. Our feature space is composed of nine VST+VISTA magnitudes from $u$ to $K_s$ and all the possible colors, but most relevant for the classification are the $g$-band and the $u-g$, $g-r$ and $J-K_s$ colors. We check the performance of our classifier both for the fiducial WAVES-Wide limits, as well as for a range of neighboring redshift and magnitude thresholds, consistently finding purity and completeness at the level of 94-95\\%. We note, however, that this performance deteriorates for sources close to the selection limits, due to deficiencies of the current spectroscopic training sample and the decreasing signal-to-noise of the photometry. We apply the classifier trained on the full spectroscopic sample to 14 million photometric galaxies from the WAVES input catalog, which have all 9 bands measured. Our work demonstrates that a machine-learning classifier could be used to select a flux- and redshift-limited sample from deep photometric data.",

McDonald, Marceau Limousin Submitted to ApJ 2025 Oct 11. See figure 2 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) For any elliptical potential with an external parallel shear, Witt has proven that the gravitational center lies on a rectangular hyperbola derived from the image positions of a single quadruply lensed object. Moreover, it is predicted that for an isothermal elliptical potential the source position both lies on Witt's Hyperbola and coincides with the center of Wynne's Ellipse (fitted through the four images). Thus, by fitting Witt's Hyperbolae to several quartets of images - ten are known in Abell 1689 - the points of intersection provide an estimate for the center for the assumed isothermal elliptical potential. We introduce a new figure of merit defined by the offset of the center of Wynne's Ellipse from Witt's Hyperbola. This offset quantifies deviations from an ideal elliptical isothermal potential and serves as a discriminant to exclude poorly fitted quadruples and assign greater weight to intersections of hyperbolae of better fitting systems. Applying the method to 10 quads (after excluding 7 poorly fitted quads) in Abell 1689, we find the potential is centered within 11\" of the BCG, X-ray center, flexion-based center and the center found from a total strong lensing analysis. The Wynne-Witt framework thus delivers a fast, analytic, and self-consistency-checked estimator for centers in clusters with multiple quads.",

Muñoz, Masami Ouchi, Shun Saito, Donald P. Schneider, Lutz Wisotzki Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present a measurement of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ (Ly$\\alpha$) intensity mapping power spectrum from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX). We measure the cross-power spectrum of the Ly$\\alpha$ intensity and Ly$\\alpha$-emitting galaxies (LAEs) in a redshift range of $1.9 < z < 3.5$. We calculate the intensity from HETDEX spectra that do not contain any detected LAEs above a signal-to-noise ratio of $5.5$. To produce a power spectrum model and its covariance matrix, we simulate the data using lognormal mocks for the LAE catalog and Ly$\\alpha$ intensity in redshift space. The simulations include the HETDEX sensitivity, selection function, and mask. The measurements yield the product of the LAE bias, the intensity bias, the mean intensity of undetected sources, and the ratio of the actual and fiducial redshift-space distortion parameters, $b_\\mathrm{g} b_I \\langle I \\rangle \\bar{F}_{\\rm RSD} / \\bar{F}^{\\rm fid}_{\\rm RSD}= (6.7 \\pm 3.1)$, $(11.7 \\pm 1.4)$, and $(8.3 \\pm 1.5) \\times 10^{-22} \\, \\text{erg}\\, \\text{s}^{-1} \\, \\text{cm}^{-2} \\, \\text{arcsec}^{-2} \\, \\text{Å}^{-1}$ in three redshift bins centered at $\\bar z=2.1$, 2.6, and 3.2, respectively. The results are reasonably consistent with cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that include Ly$\\alpha$ radiative transfer. They are, however, significantly smaller than previous results from cross-correlations of quasars with Ly$\\alpha$ intensity. These results demonstrate the statistical power of HETDEX for Ly$\\alpha$ intensity mapping and pave the way for a more comprehensive analysis. They will also be useful for constraining models of Ly$\\alpha$ emission from galaxies used in modern cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.",

We propose a novel null test of cosmic curvature tailored to DESI BAO data that combines $F_{AP}$ with the ratios $D_V'/D_V$ or $D_M'/D_M$. This null test can also be performed using a joint dataset of DESI BAO and type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) observations. Additionally, we use the test to assess the internal consistency and mutual compatibility of these datasets. We find that the data are compatible. Although the results show that a spatially flat universe is inconsistent with the data at low redshift $z\\lesssim 0.5$, we cannot draw the conclusion that the observational data prefers $\\Omega_k\\neq 0$ because there is no observational data in that region.",

Narayan 20 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables. Submitted to MNRAS. BayeSN-TD code will be made public upon acceptance of the paper Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present BayeSN-TD, an enhanced implementation of the probabilistic type Ia supernova (SN Ia) BayeSN SED model, designed for fitting multiply-imaged, gravitationally lensed type Ia supernovae (glSNe Ia). BayeSN-TD fits for magnifications and time-delays across multiple images while marginalising over an achromatic, Gaussian process-based treatment of microlensing, to allow for time-dependent deviations from a typical SN Ia SED caused by gravitational lensing by stars in the lensing system. BayeSN-TD is able to robustly infer time delays and produce well-calibrated uncertainties, even when applied to simulations based on a different SED model and incorporating chromatic microlensing, strongly validating its suitability for time-delay cosmography. We then apply BayeSN-TD to publicly available photometry of the glSN Ia SN H0pe, inferring time delays between images BA and BC of $\\Delta T_{BA}=121.9^{+9.5}_{-7.5}$ days and $\\Delta T_{BC}=63.2^{+3.2}_{-3.3}$ days along with absolute magnifications $\\beta$ for each image, $\\beta_A = 2.38^{+0.72}_{-0.54}$, $\\beta_B=5.27^{+1.25}_{-1.02}$ and $\\beta_C=3.93^{+1.00}_{-0.75}$. Combining our constraints on time-delays and magnifications with existing lens models of this system, we infer $H_0=69.3^{+12.6}_{-7.8}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, consistent with previous analysis of this system; incorporating additional constraints based on spectroscopy yields $H_0=66.8^{+13.4}_{-5.4}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. While this is not yet precise enough to draw a meaningful conclusion with regard to the `Hubble tension', upcoming analysis of SN H0pe with more accurate photometry enabled by template images, and other glSNe, will provide stronger constraints on $H_0$; BayeSN-TD will be a valuable tool for these analyses.",

Ciprijanovic, Ana Maria Delgado, John Soltis, John F. Wu, Mikaeel Yunus, John ZuHone Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The application of deep machine learning methods in astronomy has exploded in the last decade, with new models showing remarkably improved performance on benchmark tasks. Not nearly enough attention is given to understanding the models' robustness, especially when the test data are systematically different from the training data, or \"out of domain.\" Domain shift poses a significant challenge for simulation-based inference, where models are trained on simulated data but applied to real observational data. In this paper, we explore domain shift and test domain adaptation methods for a specific scientific case: simulation-based inference for estimating galaxy cluster masses from X-ray profiles. We build datasets to mimic simulation-based inference: a training set from the Magneticum simulation, a scatter-augmented training set to capture uncertainties in scaling relations, and a test set derived from the IllustrisTNG simulation. We demonstrate that the Test Set is out of domain in subtle ways that would be difficult to detect without careful analysis. We apply three deep learning methods: a standard neural network (NN), a neural network trained on the scatter-augmented input catalogs, and a Deep Reconstruction-Regression Network (DRRN), a semi-supervised deep model engineered to address domain shift. Although the NN improves results by 17% in the Training Data, it performs 40% worse on the out-of-domain Test Set. Surprisingly, the Scatter-Augmented Neural Network (SANN) performs similarly. While the DRRN is successful in mapping the training and Test Data onto the same latent space, it consistently underperforms compared to a straightforward Yx scaling relation. These results serve as a warning that simulation-based inference must be handled with extreme care, as subtle differences between training simulations and observational data can lead to unforeseen biases creeping into the results.",

Bosman, Rebekka Bieri Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Measurements of quasar lifetimes at high redshift indicate that the earliest billion-solar-mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have only been active as luminous quasars for less than a million years. Recently, extended Ly$\\alpha$ nebulae around $z\\sim6$ quasars have revealed that these short observed lifetimes are unlikely a sightline-dependent effect. However, the interpretation of Ly$\\alpha$ emission is not straightforward due to its resonant nature. In this work, we use rest-frame optical emission lines, which more directly trace photoionization by the quasar, to unambiguously validate the short line-of-sight quasar lifetimes observed at early cosmic epochs. We use deep James Webb Space Telescope/NIRSpec IFU observations of five $z\\sim 6$ quasars with small proximity zones to search for their extended emission line nebulae in H$\\alpha$ and [O III]$5007$, and detect extended emission in both emission lines around four quasars in our sample. We then use the light-crossing time of these nebulae to measure quasar lifetimes along transverse sightlines. Using their H$\\alpha$ nebulae, we also confirm that recombination is likely the dominant emission mechanism behind their previously detected Ly$\\alpha$ nebulae. Our results confirm the existence of high-redshift quasars with extremely short lifetimes, $t_{\\rm Q} \\lesssim 10^{5}\\ {\\rm yr}$, hosting billion-solar-mass black holes, indicating that rapid accretion is likely responsible for the assembly of SMBHs in the early Universe.",

The problem is particularly severe for faint galaxies with sparse spectroscopic training data. In this work, we introduce nflow-$z$, a novel photo-$z$ estimation method using the powerful machine learning technique of normalizing flow (NF). nflow-$z$ explicitly models the redshift probability distribution conditioned on the observables such as fluxes and colors. We build two nflow-$z$ implementations, dubbed cINN and cNSF, and compare their performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of nflow-$z$ on several datasets, including a CSST mock, the COSMOS2020 catalog, and samples from DES Y1, SDSS, and DESCaLS. Our evaluation against state-of-the-art algorithms shows that nflow-$z$ performs favorably. For instance, cNSF surpasses Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Convolutional Neutral Network on the CSST mock test. We also achieve a ~30\\% improvement over official results for the faint DESCaLS sample and outperform conditional Generative Adversarial Network and Mixture Density Network methods on the DES Y1 dataset test. Furthermore, nflow-$z$ is computationally efficient, requiring only a fraction of the computing time of some of the competing algorithms. Our algorithm is particularly effective for the faint sample with sparse training data, making it highly suitable for upcoming Stage IV surveys.",

We examine how neural networks complement classical statistics, extending our data analytical toolkit for modern surveys. Astronomy offers unique opportunities through encoding physical symmetries, conservation laws, and differential equations directly into architectures, creating models that generalize beyond training data. Yet challenges persist as unlabeled observations number in billions while confirmed examples with known properties remain scarce and expensive. This review demonstrates how deep learning incorporates domain knowledge through architectural design, with built-in assumptions guiding models toward physically meaningful solutions. We evaluate where these methods offer genuine advances versus claims requiring careful scrutiny. - Neural architectures overcome trade-offs between scalability, expressivity, and data efficiency by encoding physical symmetries and conservation laws into network structure, enabling learning from limited labeled data. - Simulation-based inference and anomaly detection extract information from complex, non-Gaussian distributions where analytical likelihoods fail, enabling field-level cosmological analysis and systematic discovery of rare phenomena. - Multi-scale neural modeling bridges resolution gaps in astronomical simulations, learning effective subgrid physics from expensive high-fidelity runs to enhance large-volume calculations where direct computation remains prohibitive. - Emerging paradigms-reinforcement learning for telescope operations, foundation models learning from minimal examples, and large language model agents for research automation-show promise though are still developing in astronomical applications.",

All types of signals are positive and robust in TNG300 and EAGLE and positive or null in Horizon-AGN, except for the disks around ellipticals correlation for reduced shapes at $z=1$ when defined by $|v/\\sigma|$, which is negative.

We jointly fit 3D bulge and disk models to 2505 galaxies in GOODS-South across seven bands (bvizYJH) to IAB = 25.5, accounting for different component ellipticities and inclination-dependent dust extinction. Extinction strongly affects structural parameters and colour gradients in ~26% of the sample - primarily edge-on galaxies with central obscuration (B-band face-on optical depth tau ~ 4) that reveal clear bulge components in the near-infrared. Despite irregular morphologies, the model captures observed colour gradients well. Bulges at z ~ 1 differ markedly from z ~ 0, with typical Sersic index n ~ 1.0 and bulge-to-disc size ratio Re/hd ~ 0.15, suggesting most galaxies host pseudo-bulges formed via secular evolution. Galaxy ellipticity correlates strongly with disk scale-length and absolute magnitude, partly driven by dust extinction variations. We trace bulge and disk evolution from z ~ 0 to z ~ 2.5: bulges are redder than disks (observed-frame) at z < 1.4, but colours converge at higher redshifts and fainter magnitudes. Redder galaxies show redder cores relative to their outskirts, and brighter galaxies have redder cores.",

Bryan, Mordecai-Mark Mac Low, Mihir Kulkarni, Eric P. Andersson, Kaley Brauer, John H. Wise 14 pages, 7 figures, 1 table, submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present an extension of our semi-analytic model that follows the formation of Population III stars and their metal-enriched descendants, incorporating dark matter halo merger trees from cosmological $N$-body simulations and feedback from reionization. Our extended model is calibrated using two complementary cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: Aeos, which resolves individual Population III and II stars to $z\\sim14.6$, and Renaissance, which is lower resolution but follows large-scale metal-enriched star formation to $z \\sim 11$. With a combined calibration, we capture small-scale physics of primordial star formation over a large range in halo mass. We find good agreement between our calibrated model and Aeos, reproducing the evolution in number of star-forming halos and total stellar mass. Achieving this agreement requires increasing the normalization of, flattening the redshift dependence of, and adding scatter to the commonly used critical mass threshold $M_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. Our treatment of the delay between Pop III stellar death and subsequent Pop II star formation emphasizes the need to account for halos that have yet to transition to Pop II, since incomplete sampling of this delay in simulations limits physically motivated calibrations. Finally, we apply our model to larger-volume dark matter only simulations and predict $\\sim10$ active Pop III sources at $z = 10$ lie within the area strongly lensed by galaxy cluster MACS J0416 with a magnification exceeding $\\mu > 30$. These results demonstrate that semi-analytic approaches, when calibrated to hydrodynamical simulations, can provide accurate, computationally efficient predictions for the earliest stages of cosmic star formation.",

In Bayesian terms, this can be achieved by considering the evidence ratio, enabling choices between two competing models. We generalise this concept by constructing Markovian random walks for exploring the entire model space. In analogy to the logarithmic likelihood ratio in parameter estimation problem, the process is governed by the logarithmic evidence ratio. We apply our methodology to selecting a polynomial for the dark energy equation of state function $w(a)$ on the basis of data for the supernova distance-redshift relation.",

This version matches the one accepted for publication Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Removing contaminants is a delicate, yet crucial step in neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping and often considered the technique's greatest challenge. Here, we address this challenge by analysing HI intensity maps of about $100$ deg$^2$ at redshift $z\\approx0.4$ collected by the MeerKAT radio telescope, an SKA Observatory (SKAO) precursor, with a combined 10.5-hour observation. Using unsupervised statistical methods, we removed the contaminating foreground emission and systematically tested, step-by-step, some common pre-processing choices to facilitate the cleaning process. We also introduced and tested a novel multiscale approach: the data were redundantly decomposed into subsets referring to different spatial scales (large and small), where the cleaning procedure was performed independently. We confirm the detection of the HI cosmological signal in cross-correlation with an ancillary galactic data set, without the need to correct for signal loss. In the best set-up we achieved, we were able to constrain the HI distribution through the combination of its cosmic abundance ($\\Omega_{HI}$) and linear clustering bias ($b_{HI}$) up to a cross-correlation coefficient ($r$). We measured $\\Omega_{HI}b_{HI}r = [0.93 \\pm 0.17]\\,\\times\\,10^{-3}$ with a $\\approx6\\sigma$ confidence, which is independent of scale cuts at both edges of the probed scale range ($0.04 \\lesssim k \\lesssim 0.3 \\,h$ Mpc$^{-1}$), corroborating its robustness. Our new pipeline has successfully found an optimal compromise in separating contaminants without incurring a catastrophic signal loss. This development instills an added degree of confidence in the outstanding science we can deliver with MeerKAT on the path towards HI intensity mapping surveys with the full SKAO.",

Sorce, Mathieu Langer Accepted in A&A on October 6th 2025, 18 pages, 10 figures and 2 tables Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Galaxy clusters are currently the endpoint of the hierarchical structure formation; they form via the accretion of dark matter and cosmic gas from their local environment. In particular, filaments contribute grandly by accreting gas from cosmic matter sheets and underdense regions and feeding it to the galaxy clusters. Along the way, the gas in filaments is shocked and heated, which, together with the velocity structure within the filament, induces swirling and, thus, turbulence. In this work, we study a constrained hydrodynamical simulation replica of the Virgo cluster to characterise the velocity field in the two cosmic filaments connected to the cluster with unprecedented high resolution. First, we conduct a qualitative examination of slices extracted from the simulation. We study the temperature, the velocity field, and derived quantities in longitudinal cuts to study the general structure of the filaments and in transverse cuts to study their inner organisation and connection to cosmic matter sheets and underdense regions. Then, we conduct a quantitative study of velocities in Virgo's filaments by computing the 2D energy spectrum from 1 and 5~Mpc square maps extracted from the slices and centred on the core of the filaments. We show that the velocity field goes from mostly compressive far in the filaments to mostly solenoidal in Virgo's core. Moreover, we observe that the total energy spectrum in the filaments gains in amplitude and steepens towards Virgo.",

The detection of the redshifted 21-cm signal from these epochs is challenging due to the dominance of significantly stronger astrophysical foregrounds and the presence of systematics. This work used the 21cm E2E (end to end) pipeline, followed by simulation methodology described \\cite{2022Mazumder} to conduct synthetic observations of a simulated sky model that includes both the redshifted 21-cm signal and foregrounds. A framework was constructed using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Bayesian techniques to directly deduce astrophysical parameters from the measured power spectrum. This approach eliminates the need for explicit telescope layout effects correction in interferometric arrays such as SKA-Low. The present work investigates the impact of gain calibration errors and sky model position errors on the recovery of the redshifted 21-cm power spectrum for the SKA-Low AA$^{\\ast}$ array configuration. We assessed the effects of these inaccuracies on the deduced astrophysical parameters and established acceptable tolerance levels. Based on our results, the gain calibration error tolerance for ideal signal detection is 0.001 \\%. However, if the sky model position errors exceed 0.048 arcseconds, the remaining foregrounds would obscure the target signal.",

We analyze three solar modulation models: the force-field approximation (FFA), a time-, charge-, and rigidity-dependent FFA, and a three-dimensional numerical simulation based on the Parker transport equation. Based on AMS-02 latest antiproton data (2025), our results show that the significance of the DM signal is sensitive to the chosen modulation model, with a 2$\\sigma$ signal for the FFA (4$\\sigma$ if including data from H, He, C, O, B/C, and B/O) and a reduced significance for more complex models. We also address systematic uncertainties using two methods: the add-in-quadrature method, which assumes uncorrelated uncertainties between energy bins, and the nuisance parameter method, which treats systematic uncertainties as nuisance parameters during the fitting process. Fitted to AMS-02 antiproton data, DM annihilation to the $b\\bar{b}$ scenario with three different solar modulation models shows that the add-in-quadrature method causes overfitting, whereas the nuisance parameters approach leads to underfitting. Statistically, the signal region of the FFA model using the add-in-quadrature method is the most reliable. This work highlights the need for refined solar modulation models and a better treatment of uncertainties for a conclusive interpretation of the AMS-02 data.",

Published in OJAp Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We show that the `shot noise' bias in angular clustering power spectra observed from discrete samples of points is not noise, but rather a known additive contribution that naturally arises due to degenerate pairs of points. In particular, we show that the true shot noise contribution cannot have a `non-Poissonian' value, even though all point processes with non-trivial two-point statistics are non-Poissonian. Apparent deviations from the `Poissonian' value can arise when significant correlations or anti-correlations are localised on small spatial scales. However, such deviations always correspond to a physical difference in two-point statistics, not a difference in noise. In the context of simulations, if clustering is treated as the tracer of a discretised underlying density field, any sub- or super-Poissonian sampling of the tracer induces such small-scale modifications and vice versa; we show this explicitly using recent innovations in angular power spectrum estimation from discrete catalogues. Finally, we show that the full covariance of clustering power spectra can also be computed explicitly: it depends only on the two-, three- and four-point statistics of the point process. The usual Gaussian covariance approximation appears as one term in the shot noise contribution, which is non-diagonal even for Gaussian random fields and Poisson sampling.",

Hirata Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Currently the asteroid mass window (mass $\\sim 10^{17}- 10^{21}$ grams) remains unconstrained for Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) to make up all of the dark matter content of the universe. Given these PBHs have very small masses, their Hawking temperature can be up to hundreds of keV. This study investigates the potential impacts of PBH Hawking radiation on the intergalactic medium from $z\\sim 800-25$, namely studying the ionization history, kinetic gas temperature, and ultimately the 21 cm signature. We find that for masses on the low edge of the asteroid mass window, there are up two orders of magnitude increases in the ionization fraction and kinetic gas temperature by redshift 25, and the 21 cm spin temperature can differ from non-PBH cosmology by factors of a few. This analysis results in maximum differential brightness temperatures of +17 mK for our lightest PBH masses of $2.12\\times 10^{16}$g. We also show maximal $53$ mK discrepancies in differential brightness temperatures between our PBH and non-PBH cosmologies for our lightest PBH mass, while our heaviest PBH mass of $1.65 \\times 10^{17}$g shows only $0.5$ mK variations. We find the Hawking-radiated electrons and positrons are instrumental in driving these IGM modifications.

Using both simulations and analytical arguments, we highlight how the post-component separation uncertainty and systematic foreground residuals in the cleaned CMB power spectrum depend on spatial variations in the spectral parameters. We show that allowing spectral parameters to vary across subsets of the sky pixels is essential to achieve competitive S/N on the reconstructed CMB after component separation while keeping residual foreground bias under control. Although several strategies exist to define pixel subsets for the spectral parameters, each with its advantages and limitations, we show using current foreground simulations in the context of next-generation space-borne missions that there are satisfactory configurations in which both statistical and systematic residuals become negligible. The exact magnitude of these residuals, however, depends on the mission's specific characteristics, especially its frequency coverage and sensitivity. We also show that the post-component separation statistical uncertainty is only weakly dependent on the properties of the foregrounds and propose a semi-analytical framework to estimate it. On the contrary, the systematic foreground residuals highly depend on both the properties of the foregrounds and the chosen spatial resolution of the spectral parameters.",

For simulated halos of dwarf galaxy scale ($M_{\\rm halo}(z=0)\\approx 10^{10}\\,M_\\odot$), we study the central structure in both dissipationless simulations and simulations with full FIRE-2 galaxy formation physics. As has been demonstrated extensively in recent years, both baryonic feedback and self-interactions can convert central cusps into cores, with the former process doing so in a manner that depends sensitively on stellar mass at fixed $M_{\\rm halo}$. Whether the two processes (baryonic feedback and self-interactions) are distinguishable, however, remains an open question. Here we demonstrate that, compared to feedback-induced cores, SIDM-induced cores transition more quickly from the central region of constant density to the falling density at larger radial scales. This result holds true even when including identical galaxy formation modeling in SIDM simulations as is used in CDM simulations, since self-interactions dominate over galaxy formation physics in establishing the central structure of SIDM halos in this mass regime. The change in density profile slope as a function of radius therefore holds the potential to discriminate between self-interactions and galaxy formation physics as the driver of core formation in dwarf galaxies.",

Analyzing the NASA-Sloan Atlas catalog in the redshift range of $0.02\\le z<0.09$, we observationally determine the probability density distributions, $p(r_{50})$ and $p(r_{90})$, where $r_{50}$ and $r_{90}$ denote the galaxy sizes enclosing $50\\%$ and $90\\%$ of their $r$-band luminosities, respectively. Both of the distributions are found to be well described by a bimodal Gamma mixture model, which is consistent with the recent numerical results. Classifying the local galaxies by their ratios, $r_{50}/r_{90}$, we also show that for the case of late-type galaxies with $r_{50}/r_{90}\\ge 0.45$ both of $p(r_{50})$ and $p(r_{90})$ exhibit no bimodal feature, following a unimodal Gamma model.

Recent studies have suggested that there are large uncorrected flux scale errors in this map, however.

We construct a Gibbs sampling scheme to recover the full joint posterior distribution of $\\sim 50,000$ parameters, representing the true sky brightness temperature field, as-yet uncorrected flux scale factors, and synchrotron power-law spectral indices. Using idealised full-sky simulated data, we perform a joint analysis of a $1^\\circ$ resolution diffuse map at 408 MHz and multi-band 21cm global signal data with $30^\\circ$ resolution under different assumptions about 1) noise levels in the maps, 2) sky coverage, and 3) synchrotron spectral index information. For our fiducial scenario in which the global signal experiment has a 50 mK noise rms per coarse pixel in each of 20 frequency bins between 50 -- 150 MHz -- the typical range for a global signal experiment,, we find that the notional Haslam flux scale factors can be recovered in most (but not all) sub-regions of the sky to an accuracy of $\\pm 2 \\%$. In all cases we are able to rectify the sky map to within $\\sim 5$ K of the true brightness temperature.

Rastinejad 15 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) In addition to a $\\gamma$-ray burst (GRB), the merger of two neutron stars may produce a temporarily or indefinitely stable neutron star remnant with a strong magnetic field (a \"magnetar\"). As this magnetar remnant spins down, it can deposit its rotational energy into the surrounding kilonova ejecta, producing synchrotron emission that peaks in the radio bands $\\sim$months-years after the merger (\"boosted kilonova\"). The nearby ($z=0.0763$) long-duration GRB 211211A, which has an apparent kilonova counterpart and likely neutron star merger progenitor, may have produced such a remnant. We observed the location of GRB 211211A at 6 GHz with the NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) spanning $\\approx 0.54$-$1.7~$years after the burst. We do not detect any radio emission, placing strong limits on the energy deposited into the ejecta by any remnant to $\\lesssim 4.4 \\times 10^{52}~{\\rm erg}$. Due to the proximity of the event, we are also able to place limits on a kilonova afterglow that did not receive any additional energy deposition, though it is possible such emission will be suppressed until $\\sim 4~{\\rm years}$ after the burst, when the kilonova is expected to overtake the forward shock of the GRB. Future observations with the VLA and next-generation radio facilities will be able to further constrain the magnetar-boosted kilonova and kilonova afterglow scenarios, as well as directly constrain models in the scenario that GRB 211211A was instead produced by a collapsar.",

Wong 12 pages, 7 figures. Submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We characterize the spatial power spectrum of density fluctuations in magnetohydrodynamic flows in a suite of high-resolution, long-time-span general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. Extracting the local spatial power spectrum in curved spacetime directly from GRMHD simulations can be challenging for several conceptual and mechanical reasons, including choices of the reference frame, the non-uniform co-ordinate grid of the outputs and limited resolution. Taylor's frozen-in hypothesis describes a mapping between the temporal and spatial power spectrum of turbulence, which we apply to density fluctuations. We explore the validity of the assumptions underlying Taylor's hypothesis and evaluate its applicability in extracting spatial power spectra of density fluctuations of black hole accretion flows. Using outputs from the GRMHD code KORAL, we explore models with strong and ordered magnetic fields (MAD, Magnetically Arrested Disks) as well as weak and disordered magnetic fields (SANE, Standard and Normal Evolution). We explore the effects of black hole spin on the power spectra and characterize their spectral properties as a function of distance from the black hole. The observed power spectra follow a broken power law with two slopes separated by a break frequency. Our analysis shows a decrease in break frequency with increasing radius, with distinct trends between SANE and MAD flows. We also observe the first slope to be steeper for SANE flows and some notable distinctions between prograde and retrograde spins.",

Craig Wheeler, Yi Yang 30 pages, 17 figures, 2 tables, submitted to AAS Journals High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present optical + near-infrared (NIR) + mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the normal Type~Ia supernovae (SN Ia) 2022aaiq and 2024gy in the nebular phase, continuously spanning 0.35--28 microns. Medium-resolution JWST spectroscopy reveals novel narrow ($v_{\\mathrm{FWHM}}<1500$ km s$^{-1}$) [Ni II] 1.94 and 6.64 micron cores in both events. The MIR [Ni II] 6.64 micron line exhibits a distinct narrow core atop a broader base, indicating a central enhancement of stable Ni. This structure points to high central densities consistent with a near-Chandrasekhar-mass ($M_{Ch}$) progenitor or a high-metallicity sub-$M_{Ch}$ progenitor. From detailed line-profile inversions of SN 2024gy, we derive emissivity profiles for stable iron-group elements (IGEs), radioactive material, and intermediate-mass elements (IMEs), revealing spatially distinct ejecta zones. The [Ni III] 7.35 micron line shows a shallow-to-steep slope transition - a \"broken-slope\" morphology - that matches predictions for delayed detonation explosions with separated deflagration and detonation ashes. We also reanalyze and compare to archival JWST spectra of SN 2021aefx and the subluminous SN 2022xkq. We estimate a stable $^{58}$Ni mass of $\\sim0.1$ M$_\\odot$ for SN 2024gy, consistent with delayed detonation models, and $\\sim0.01$ M$_\\odot$ for SN 2022xkq, favoring sub-$M_{Ch}$ scenarios. These results demonstrate that resolved line profiles, now accessible with JWST, provide powerful diagnostics of explosion geometry, central density, and progenitor mass in SN Ia.",

Accepted for publication in A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) Magnetic reconnection, often accompanied by turbulence interaction, is a ubiquitous phenomenon in astrophysical environments. However, the current understanding of the nature of turbulent magnetic reconnection remains insufficient. We investigate the statistical properties of reconnection turbulence in the framework of the self-driven reconnection. Using the open-source software package AMUN, we first perform numerical simulations of turbulent magnetic reconnection. We then obtain the statistical results of reconnection turbulence by traditional statistical methods such as the power spectrum and structure function. Our numerical results demonstrate: (1) the velocity spectrum of reconnection turbulence follows the classical Kolmogorov type of $E\\propto k^{-5/3}$, while the magnetic field spectrum is steeper than the Kolmogorov spectrum, which are independent of limited resistivity, guide field, and isothermal or adiabatic fluid states; (2) most of the simulations show the anisotropy cascade, except that the presence of a guide field leads to an isotropic cascade; (3) reconnection turbulence is incompressible in the adiabatic state, with energy distribution dominated by the velocity solenoidal component; (4) different from pure magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, the intermittency of the velocity field is stronger than that of the magnetic field in reconnection turbulence. The steep magnetic field spectrum, together with the velocity spectrum of Kolmogorov type, can characterize the feature of the reconnection turbulence. In the case of the presence of the guide field, the isotropy of the reconnection turbulence cascade is also different from the cascade mode of pure MHD turbulence. Our experimental results provide new insights into the properties of reconnection turbulence, which will contribute to advancing the self-driven reconnection theory.",

By using a novel method based on the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT), we present the first QPO-phase-resolved timing and spectral analysis of accreting X-ray pulsars in low mass X-ray binaries. Broadband QPO waveforms have been reconstructed and exhibit approximately sinusoidal shapes, with fractional amplitudes that vary with energy. In addition, we find that spin pulse profiles exhibit stable shapes between different QPO phases with different instantaneous fluxes, while the fractional root-mean-square (rms) is distinct for different observations. In this source, both QPO-phase-resolved and averaged spectra can be modeled with a negative and positive powerlaws exponential (NPEX) model, and their spectral evolutions show a similar trend, suggesting that the QPO modulation is caused by accretion rate variability instead of a geometric obscuration. These results provide new constraints on accretion physics in strongly magnetized neutron stars and the underlying mechanisms of QPOs.",

Using the full currently available Insight-HXMT dataset from July 2017 to June 2023, we make a comprehensive spectral-timing analysis of this source and report four main findings. First, we uncover a QPO frequency rising branch between MJD 58206 and 58230, where the centroid frequency increases from $\\sim$2 Hz to $\\sim$6 Hz, consistent with a spectral state transition from the hard to intermediate state. This rising branch completes the full QPO frequency evolution cycle when combined with the subsequent frequency decay phase, and had been missed in prior NICER and Insight-HXMT studies. Second, we identify a previously unreported Flare 3 during the obscured state, which shows distinct spectral and timing properties compared to the earlier flares. Third, we detect sub-Hz QPOs (<1 Hz) in all three flares, specifically at $\\sim$0.01 Hz in Flare 1 and $\\sim$0.2 Hz in both Flares 2 and 3. In particular, the weak $\\sim$0.2 Hz signals observed in Flare 3 indicate ongoing coronal activity despite strong obscuration. Finally, a comparison between QPOs above and below 1 Hz suggests distinct origins, with the former likely arising from Lense-Thirring precession of the inner hot flow and the latter from magnetic perturbations driving a failed disk wind. These findings offer new insights into the unique accretion geometry and variability behaviors of GRS 1915+105.",

It is uncertain which celestial catalog is suitable for this special ultra-long event to belong to. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the lightcurves obtained by Fermi-GBM detectors. In the energy band of 8-1000 keV, no Quasi-Period Oscillation (QPO) signals are found in the lightcurve of the first burst 250702D, a possible QPO signal of 0.046 Hz corresponding to a period of 21.7 s is found in the lightcurve of the second burst 250702B, and a possible QPO signal of 0.024 Hz corresponding to a period of 41.7 s is found in the lightcurve of last burst 250702E. The significance level of the possible QPO signals is comprehensively examined. In addition, we examine the spectral properties of the sources. In general, a broken power law is suitable for modeling the spectral data from 8 keV to 40 MeV.

The Einstein Probe (EP) mission provides a transformative opportunity to investigate their nature. While mounting observations of EP-discovered EFXTs (EP-EFXTs) suggest a possible connection to long gamma-ray bursts (lGRBs), an in-depth comparative analysis between them remains lacking. Here, we present a comparative analysis of their cosmic formation histories, revealing that EP-EFXTs and lGRBs share a similar evolutionary trend-showing a marked decline at $z<1.0$ and a plateau beyond $1.0<z<5$-which clearly distinguishes them from short GRBs. This result is derived from a rigorously selected sample of EP-EFXTs, using Lynden-Bell's $c^{-}$ method to reconstruct, for the first time, the luminosity function and formation rate of EP-EFXTs without any assumptions. Our findings provide independent evidence that EP-EFXTs and lGRBs may originate from a common progenitor channel.",

At the peak of the flare, the source undergoes a brief transition from the hard-intermediate state (HIMS) into the soft-intermediate state (SIMS), marked by the simultaneous appearance of three discrete radio jet ejections, a drop in broadband noise in the 2$-$10 keV band, and the presence of a narrow quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) with a characteristic ``U''-shaped phase-lag spectrum and a quality factor of $Q \\geq 6$, features that robustly identify it as a Type-B QPO. The Type-C QPO, which was clearly detected in the HIMS prior to the flare, is not observed at the flare's peak and only reappears afterward. Most notably, we find that the Type-B QPO is not restricted to the SIMS: it is present throughout all our observations, including those taken in the HIMS, where it appears as a broad shoulder of the Type-C QPO. During the flare, the Type-B and Type-C QPOs exhibit distinct evolutionary trends in frequency, fractional rms amplitude, and phase lag. These results challenge the traditional view that Type-B QPOs are exclusive to the SIMS, a state that is, in fact, defined by their appearance in the power spectrum, and directly linked to discrete jet ejections. Instead, our findings suggest that the physical conditions giving rise to Type-B QPOs occur more broadly within the inner accretion flow.",

Based on the pulsar binary scenario, we model the interaction between the pulsar wind and stellar wind from the massive companion star, which creates a shock. To accurately compute the resulting polarization of the stellar wind, we develop a method for the Thomson scattering that accounts for the finite size of the companion star. By fitting the optical polarization data, we constrain the system parameters, such as eccentricity, the momentum ratio of the two winds, and mass-loss rate from the companion star. We find that (i) the predicted eccentricity $e\\sim 0.1$ is smaller than the values derived from the radial velocity curve and (ii) the orbital phase of the periastron is $\\nu_{\\rm p}=0.5-0.6$, which is consistent with the previous polarization study of Kravtsov et al. Additionally, we estimate the mass-loss rate from the companion star and the momentum ratio of two winds as $\\dot{M}\\sim 2\\times 10^{-6}\\rm M_{\\odot}~{\\rm year^{-1}}$ and $\\eta>0.1$, respectively. Assuming that the pulsar wind carries the spin-down energy, the spin-down magnetic field of the putative pulsar inferred from these parameters is of the order of $B\\sim 10^{14}\\mathrm{G}$, which may support the highly-B pulsar or magnetar scenario for the compact object of $\\rm{LS\\ I} +61^{\\circ}303$.

We identify a characteristic luminosity dependence in dual AGN fractions by compiling recent observational datasets, providing crucial constraints on supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) populations. Our AGN-based model reproduces the current SGWB measurements within PTA observational uncertainties of $2 - 4 \\sigma$ uncertainties, demonstrating consistency between electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations.

Our analysis reveals fundamental insights into the physics governing state transitions in stellar-mass black holes. We discover distinct bimodal flux distributions in the 8-79 keV band with well-separated peaks, contrasting with overlapping distributions in the 3-8 keV band. This energy-dependent bimodality establishes hard X-rays as the optimal diagnostic for state classification, directly tracing the geometric transformation between corona-dominated and disk-dominated configurations. Power spectral analysis uncovers state-dependent characteristic frequencies shifting from 0.050 Hz (hard) to 0.074 Hz (intermediate), with featureless red noise in soft states. These frequencies correspond to disk truncation radii evolving from $\\sim$5.5 $R_g$ to $\\sim$2 $R_g$, providing direct observational evidence for the inward progression of the accretion disk during state transitions. Frequency-dependent time lags evolve systematically from $\\sim$50 ms hard lags at 0.1 Hz in hard states to near-zero in soft states, quantifying the collapse of the Comptonizing corona. Linear rms-flux relations persist across all states with parameters that precisely track the relative contributions of thermal versus non-thermal emission components. Most remarkably, we identify a failed state transition (observation 30302019006) exhibiting anticorrelated band behavior, suppressed variability ($F_{var}$ < 1.38\\%), and apparent sub-ISCO truncation. This discovery challenges standard transition models and suggests new pathways for accretion flow evolution in wind-fed systems.",

Alikhanov 7 figures, 1 table, submitted to JCAP High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Blazars, particularly Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), are well-known for their ability to accelerate a substantial population of electrons and positrons, as inferred from multiwavelength radiation observations. Therefore, these astrophysical objects are promising candidates for studying high-energy electron--positron interactions, such as the production of $W^{\\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons. In this work, we explore the implications of electron--positron annihilation processes in the jet environments of FSRQs, focusing on the resonant production of electroweak bosons and their potential contribution to the diffuse neutrino flux. By modeling the electron distribution in the jet of the FSRQ 3C~279 during a flaring state, we calculate the reaction rates for $W^{\\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons and estimate the resulting diffuse fluxes from the cosmological population of this http URL incorporate the FSRQ luminosity function and its redshift evolution to account for the population distribution across cosmic time, finding that the differential flux contribution exhibits a pronounced peak at redshift $z \\sim 1$. While the expected fluxes remain well below the detection thresholds of current neutrino observatories such as IceCube, KM3NeT, or Baikal-GVD, the expected flux from the $Z$ boson production could account for approximately $10^{-3}$ of the total diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux. These results provide a theoretical benchmark for the role of Standard Model electroweak processes in extreme astrophysical environments and emphasize the interplay between particle physics and astrophysics, illustrating that even rare high-energy interactions can leave a subtle but quantifiable imprint on the diffuse astrophysical neutrinos.",

Gamma-ray spectroscopy suggests that the GeV emission can be attributed to both the pulsar magnetosphere and inverse Compton scattering (ICS) by the pulsar wind. In particular, the TeV peak is displaced from the cluster center by several tidal radii in the trailing direction of the proper motion of UKS 1. This alignment supports a scenario in which relativistic leptons, likely driven by a millisecond pulsar population, produce very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-rays via ICS within a bow shock tail. Our findings not only highlights GCs as potential sources of VHE gamma-rays, but also offers a rare opportunity to probe cosmic ray transport in the Milky Way by studying particle propagation and anisotropic gamma-ray production associated with the extended, offset TeV feature of UKS 1.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We report on UV and X-ray observations of the 2024 eruption of the recurrent nova LMCN 1968-12a, a rapidly recurring extragalactic system with a $\\sim$4.3 year recurrence period and a massive white dwarf (WD). The eruption was discovered on 2024 August 1.8 by \\textit{Swift}, and subsequently monitored using \\textit{AstroSat}'s UVIT and SXT, along with Swift/UVOT and XRT. The multi-wavelength light curves reveal a rapid UV-optical decline, followed by a plateau phase exhibiting 1.26-day modulations consistent with the orbital period. The Supersoft (SSS) X-ray emission, that emerged by day 5, exhibited a double peak, suggesting variable obscuration that could be due to an inhomogeneous nova ejecta or due to a nova super-remnant along the line of sight. Time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy shows a blackbody component with T $\\approx 10^6$ K. The SEDs obtained concurrently in the UV, peaking at T $\\approx$ 20,000 K and with a source radius $\\sim$2-3 R$_\\odot$, are inconsistent with emission from the secondary star or nova photosphere alone. Instead, the UV emission is attributed to an irradiated accretion disk that survived the eruption. The persistent UV plateau and its temperature suggest that the accretion disk was not completely disrupted and resumed activity within days, consistent with recent findings in other rapidly recurring novae such as U~Sco and M31N~2008-12a.",

Williams-Baldwin High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) FRB 20121102A is the original repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source and also the first to be localised to milliarcsecond precision using very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). It has been active for over 13 years and resides in an extreme magneto-ionic environment in a dwarf host galaxy at a distance of ~1 Gpc. In this work, we use the European VLBI Network (EVN) to (re-)localise FRB 20121102A and its associated persistent radio source (PRS). We confirm that the two are co-located -- improving on previous results by a factor of ~4 and constraining the FRB and PRS co-location to ~12 pc transverse offset. Over a decade, the PRS luminosity on milliarcsecond scales remains consistent with measurements on larger angular scales, showing that the PRS is still compact. We also present the detection of 18 bursts with the Nancay Radio Telescope (NRT) as part of our ÉCLAT monitoring program. These bursts, together with previously published results, show that the observed dispersion measure (DM) of FRB 20121102A has dropped by ~25 pc/cc in the past five years, highlighting a fractional decrease in the local DM contribution of >15%. We discuss potential physical scenarios and highlight possible future observations that will help reveal the nature of FRB 20121102A, which is one of only a few known FRBs with a luminous PRS.",

In this Letter, we present results from a new set of weakly collisional fluid simulations in which leading order kinetic effects are modeled as viscosity and heat conduction. Consistent with earlier, lower-resolution studies, we find that overall flow dynamics remain very similar between ideal and non-ideal models. For the first time, we synthesize images and spectra of SgrA* from weakly collisional models -- assuming an isotropic, thermal population of electrons -- and find that these remain largely indistinguishable from ideal fluid predictions. However, most weakly collisional models exhibit lower light curve variability, with all magnetically dominated models showing a small but systematic decrease in variability.",

Zheng 13 pages, 5 figures, accepted to publication on ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Magnetar X-ray Burst (MXB) is usually composed of a single pulse or multiple pulses with rapid rise and brief duration mostly observed in hard X-ray (soft gamma-ray) band. Previous work studied the temporal behavior of some magnetar bursts and employed the Fast Rise Exponential Decay (FRED) model to fit pulses of MXB. However, whether there is other kind of pulse shape has not been explored. In this study, we systematically examined light curve of MXBs from SGR J1935+2154 detected by GECAM between 2021 and 2022. We find that there are different light curve morphologies. Especially, we discover a peculiar and new pattern, Exponential Rise and Cut-Off Decay (ERCOD), which is significantly different from FRED and could be well described by a mathematical function we proposed. We find that MXBs with ERCOD shape are generally longer in duration, brighter in the peak flux, and harder in spectrum. We note that the ERCOD shape is not unique to SGR J1935+2154 but also present in other magnetars. This new light curve pattern may imply a special burst and radiation mechanism of magnetar.",

We model the source spectra using absorbed power-law and absorbed multicolour disc blackbody models. The best-fit photon indices span 0.92-2.68, with typical uncertainties ranging from $\\pm$0.1 to $\\pm$1 depending on data quality. The inner disk temperature range from 0.97 to 1.69 keV, consistent with blackbody emission from an accretion disk. Our results reveal significant long-term variability in intrinsic X-ray source fluxes while the source remains relatively stable within individual observations. A Hardness-Intensity Diagram of the source shows no clear transition between hard and soft states, but an increase in brightness during two recent observations taken on 2022 December 1 and 2024 May 4. We find a positive correlation of X-ray luminosity and photon index that persists even when the hydrogen column density is tied across observations, suggesting a physical origin. The X-ray luminosity-inner disk temperature relation yields a weakly constrained slope owing to large temperature uncertainties, but a simpler fixed-slope test indicates consistency with a standard thin-disk. Using the derived disk parameters, we estimate the black hole mass to lie in the range of 16-75 $M_{\\odot}$, under the assumption of a geometrically thin accretion flow, where the lower and upper bounds correspond to a Schwarzchild and a Kerr black hole respectively. Alternatively, we consider the scenario of ULX-8 hosting an accreting neutron star and estimate the corresponding magnetic field strength required to explain the observed properties.",

Besides the widely studied $s$, $i$, and $r$ processes in moderately-to-strongly neutron-rich environments, an intriguing alternative site for lanthanide production could in fact be robustly $\\textit{proton-rich}$ matter outflows from core-collapse supernovae under specific conditions -- in particular, high-entropy winds with enhanced neutrino luminosity and fast dynamical timescales. In this environment, excess protons present after charged particle reactions have ceased can continue to be converted to neutrons by (anti-)neutrino interactions, producing a neutron capture reaction flow up to A~200. This scenario, christened the $\\nu i$ process in a recent paper, has previously been discussed as a possibility. Here, we examine the prospects for $\\nu i$ process through the lens of stellar abundance patterns, bolometric lightcurves, and galactic chemical evolution models, with a particular focus on hypernovae as candidate sites. We identify specific lanthanide signatures for which the $\\nu i$ process can provide a credible alternative to $r$/$i$ processes.",

Their flux is known to vary along the orbit, from radio to X-rays. During the past decade, gamma-ray orbital modulation (GOM) has been discovered in a handful of spiders, but its origin remains largely unknown. We present the results of a systematic search for GOM among 43 systems, selecting pulsed 0.1-1 GeV photons and using spin and orbital ephemeris from Fermi's Third Pulsar Catalog. We discover GOM from three spiders - PSR J1124-3653, PSR J1946-5403 and PSR J2215+5135 - and confirm four previous detections. In all seven cases so far, the GOM peaks near the pulsar's superior conjunction. The X-ray orbital light curves are usually in anti-phase, peaking when the pulsar is at inferior conjunction, but we find one case where both gamma-rays and X-rays peak around superior conjunction: PSR J1946-5403. We measure the modulated fractions of the GOM and find consistent values for all seven spiders, with an average $22.0\\pm2.6\\%$. Including eclipsing systems seen edge-on, we find no clear dependence of the modulated fraction on the orbital inclination (within $\\simeq$45-90$^\\circ$). Our results challenge previous models proposed to explain GOM in spiders, based on inverse Compton and synchrotron emission close to the companion, since these predict a clear dependence with orbital inclination (stronger modulation at high inclinations). We nearly double the number of GOM detections in spiders, showing that it is more common than previously thought.",

Adaptive resolution, multi-physics, and hybrid numerical methods have enabled tremendous progress on the spatial, physics, and numerical challenges involved. But often the limiter for following the long timescales of global evolution is the extremely short numerical timestep required in some subdomains (which leads to their dominating simulation costs). Recently several approaches have been developed for tackling this in problems where the short timescale solution is sampled and then projected as an effective subgrid model over longer timescales (e.g. 'zooming in and out'). We generalize these to a family of models where time evolution is modulated by a variable but continuous in space-and-time dilation/stretch factor $a({\\bf x},\\,t)$. This extends previous well-studied approaches (including reduced-speed-of-light and binary orbital dynamics methods), and ensures that the system comes to correct local steady-state solutions, and derive criteria that the dilation factor/timesteps/resolution must obey to ensure good behavior. We present a variety of generalizations to different physics or coupling scales. Compared to previous approaches, this method makes it possible to avoid imprinting arbitrary scales where there is no clear scale-separation, and couples well to Lagrangian or Eulerian methods. It is flexible and easily-implemented and we demonstrate its validity (and limitations) in test problems. We discuss the relationship between these methods and physical time dilation in GRMHD. We demonstrate how this can be used to obtain effective speedup factors exceeding $\\gtrsim 10^{4}$ in multiphysics simulations.",

Accepted in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Broadband mid-infrared (MIR) imaging with high spatial resolution is useful to study extended dust structures in the circumnuclear regions of nearby AGN. However, broadband imaging filters cannot distinguish dust continuum emission from emission lines, and so accounting for the emission line contamination becomes crucial in studying extended dust in these environments. This paper uses Cycle 1 MIR imaging from JWST/MIRI and spectroscopy from JWST/MRS for 11 local Seyfert galaxies, as part of the Galactic Activity, Torus and Outflow Survey (GATOS). Three of the objects (NGC 3081, NGC 5728, and NGC 7172) exist in both datasets, allowing direct measurement of the line emission using the spectroscopy for these objects. We find that extended MIR emission persists on scales of 100s of parsecs after the removal of contamination from emission lines. Further, the line contamination levels vary greatly between objects (from 5% to 30% in the F1000W filter), and across filters, so cannot be generalised across a sample and must be carefully treated for each object and band. We also test methods to estimate the line contamination when only MRS spectroscopy or MIRI imaging is available, using pre-JWST ancillary data. We find that these methods estimate the contamination within 10 percentage points. This paper serves as a useful guide for methods to quantify and mitigate for emission line contamination in MIRI broadband imaging",

Modern surveys are predominantly photometry-based, making the construction of a clean photometric SNe Ia sample crucial. In this study, we investigate whether functional principal component analysis (FPCA) scores derived from photometric light curves, combined with ensemble learning, can reliably distinguish SNe Ia from other transients using the PLAsTiCC dataset. FPCA provides a data-driven, flexible characterization of light curves without relying on rigid theoretical model assumptions. Light curves are fitted by minimizing residuals with penalty terms from clean samples, making the method robust to outliers or poorly sampled bands. The first two FPCA scores and peak magnitudes across the five LSST bands are used as classification features. We implement two complementary binary classifiers: an ensemble boosting model (CatBoost) and a statistical probabilistic method based on Euclidean distances. CatBoost slightly outperforms the statistical method, achieving 98.5% accuracy and 97.8% precision. Performance remains robust (>90%) under typical photometric redshift uncertainties ({\\sigma} = 0.1). On the spectroscopic DES Y5 sample, both methods reach approximately 90% accuracy and 95% precision, demonstrating strong out-of-domain generalization compared to state-of-the-art methods with limited cross-survey applicability. Applied to DECam DDF and DESIRT transients, the predictions strongly agree, and their intersection provides a high-confidence SNe Ia sample for cosmological analyses. Overall, this FPCA-based framework offers a powerful, flexible tool for classifying transients in upcoming large-scale surveys such as LSST and Roman.",

The dynamics are simulated self-consistently with GNC, which we have updated to incorporate gravitational wave orbital decay, the loss cone of a spinning MBH, and stellar evolution. Over $12$ Gyr, we investigate the evolution of the NSC with a mass-growing MBH, as well as the EMRIs of stellar black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs, brown dwarfs (BDs), and low-mass main-sequence stars (MSs), along with tidal disruption events (TDEs) involving MSs, BDs, and post-MSs. The mass growth of the MBH contributed by TDEs is typically $\\sim 10^7\\,M_{\\odot}$, $\\sim 10^6\\,M_{\\odot}$, and $\\sim 5\\times10^4\\,M_{\\odot}$ for massive, Milky-Way-like, and smaller NSCs, respectively. Between $40\\%$ and $70\\%$ of the stellar mass is lost during stellar evolution, which dominates the mass growth of the MBH if a significant fraction of the lost mass is accreted. The evolution of EMRI rates is generally affected by the cluster's size expansion or contraction, stellar population evolution, MBH mass growth, and the stellar initial mass function. The EMRI rates for compact objects peak at early epochs ($\\lesssim 1$ Gyr) and then gradually decline over cosmic time. LISA-band ($0.1$ mHz) EMRIs involving compact objects around Milky-Way-like MBHs tend to have high eccentricities, while those around spinning MBHs preferentially occupy low-inclination (prograde) orbits. In contrast, MS- and BD-EMRIs usually have eccentricity and inclination distributions that are distinct from those of compact objects.",

Pang High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The detection of the gravitational wave event GW230529, presumably a neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger, by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration marks an exciting discovery for multimessenger astronomy. The black hole (BH) has a high probability of falling within the \"mass gap\" (mg) between the neutron star (NS) and the BH mass distributions. Because of the relatively low primary mass, this system has a higher likelihood of producing an electromagnetic counterpart than previously detected NSBH mergers. We analyze the potential kilonova (KN) emission from GW230529 and find that, if the source was an NSBH merger, there is a $\\sim $2-$28\\%$ probability (depending on the assumed equation of state) that it produced a KN peaking at $\\sim 1$ day post-merger with $g \\lesssim 23.5$ and $i < 23$. Hence, it could have been detected by ground-based telescopes. If instead the event was a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, the probability of KN production drops to $\\sim $0-$10\\%$. Motivated by these results, we simulate a broader population of mgNSBH mergers expected during the fifth LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing run (O5) and find a $2$-$3\\%$ chance of KN production per event. Such KNe would typically be fainter than GW230529, with $g \\lesssim 26$ and $i \\lesssim 25$. Based on these findings, DECam-like instruments may be able to detect up to $\\sim 70\\%$ of future mgNSBH KNe, corresponding to $1-2$ multimessenger mgNSBH per year in O5.",

Accepted version High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present the implementation of a fully \\textit{time-dependent} relativistic disk model-based on the light curve fitting package FitTeD-into the X-ray spectral fitting environment, pyXspec. This implementation enables simultaneous fitting of multi-epoch and multi-wavelength spectral data, where the only free parameters are those describing the black hole and the initial conditions, while the subsequent evolution is governed by the dynamical equations of an evolving accretion flow. We use it fit seven epochs of X-ray spectra and two epochs of UV spectra of the 'long-lived' tidal disruption event (TDE) and quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) source GSN 069, from 2010 through late-2019. Our results show that such 'long-lived', X-ray-bright TDEs-of which GSN 069 is a prime, but not unique, example-can naturally be explained within the same framework as events with shorter-lived X-ray emission, like ASASSN-14li and AT2019dsg. Their distinction lies in the `viscous' timescale parameter-tied to the disk's angular momentum transport efficiency-which should be treated as a free parameter when modeling the disk evolution of transient events. We examine the implications for QPE models by tracking the time evolution of disk properties such as mass surface density and accretion rate. We argue that existing QPE models may not be able to reproduce the observed connection between the presence (2018) or absence (2014) of eruptions and the disk properties. In the context of orbiter-disk collision models, the change in mass surface density appears insufficient to explain the needed variation in the eruption's temperature. The absence of eruptions in GSN 069 in 2014 remains a challenge for QPE models.",

Numerous ultra-high energy cosmic ray experiments routinely capture radio pulses in the MHz to GHz frequency range emitted by EAS. The Monte Carlo simulation of these radio pulses is crucial to enable an accurate reconstruction of the primary cosmic ray energy and to infer the composition of the primary particles. In this work, a comprehensive comparison of the predicted electric field in EAS simulated with CoREAS and ZHAireS was conducted to estimate the systematic uncertainties arising from the use of different simulation packages in the determination of two key shower observables namely, the electromagnetic energy of the EAS and the depth of maximum development ($X_{\\rm max}$). For this comparison, input parameters and settings as similar as possible were used in both simulations, along with the same realistic atmospheric refractive index depending on altitude, which is crucial for the prediction of radio emission properties of EAS. In addition, simulated EAS with very similar values of depth of maximum development were selected. Good agreement was found between CoREAS and ZHAireS, with discrepancies in the dominant electric field components generally remaining below 10\\% across the frequency range of a few MHz to hundreds of MHz, relevant for most radio detection experiments, translating into uncertainties in the determination of energy below $5\\%$ and $\\simeq 10\\,\\mathrm{g/cm^2}$ in $X_{\\rm max}$.

The discussion highlights the flows of energy close to the black hole and the importance of the distance range from which the radiating zone draws its energy. For the hard state, we examine compact and extended corona models. We find that compact corona models are energetically favored, but extended models cannot be fully excluded. We discuss the high linear polarization of the Cyg X-1 X-rays in the soft and hard states, parallel to the direction of the radio jet. We propose the presence of a pair layer enveloping the accretion disk moving at approximately half the speed of light away from the disk for both the soft and the hard state. In the soft state, the pairs cool to the Compton temperature of the disk emission. In the hard state, the pairs acquire thermal and bulk motion allowing them to Comptonize the emission to produce the observed power law emission. In both emission states, the bulk motion away from the disk leads to a net polarization parallel to the radio jet. We emphasize that the geometry of the accretion flow in the hard state is still not well constrained, and that observed spectral (including the relativistically broadened Fe K-$\\alpha$ line) and spectro-polarimetric signatures depend strongly on the plasma processes responsible for energy dissipation in the plasma.",

Their phenomenology does not fit exactly in any other class, although it might resemble that of radio magnetars or white dwarf (WD) radio emitting binary systems. Notably, two LPTs with confirmed multi-wavelength counterparts have been identified as WD -- M dwarf binaries. Meanwhile, systems such as AR Scorpii and J1912-44 exhibit short-period pulsations in hrs-tight orbits, with polarised radio emission proposed to be generated by the interaction of the WD magnetosphere with the low-mass companion wind. Here, we investigate the longest-lived LPT known, GPM J1839-10, demonstrating that it has a ~8.75 hr orbital period. We show that its radio pulses can be modelled in the same geometric framework as WD binary pulsars, in which radio emission is triggered when the magnetic axis of a rotating WD intersects its companion's wind in the binary orbital plane. We use a 36-year timing baseline to infer the orbital period and binary geometry from radio data alone. The model naturally predicts its intermittent emission and double-pulse structure. Crucially, we show that the beat period between the spin and the orbit matches the observed pulse substructure and polarisation signatures, providing strong support for the model. Applying it to the WD pulsar J1912-44, it successfully reproduces the emission profile and geometry as well. Our results suggest analogous emission-site geometries in these related classes of binary system -- a possibility we extend to the broader LPT / WD pulsar population.",

Duffell High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Hydrogen/Helium-poor stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae with broad lines (SNe Ic-bl) almost always accompany the nearby ($z < 0.3$) jetted relativistic explosions known as long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, the majority of SNe Ic-bl have no detected GRB counterpart. At least some of these SNe should harbor off-axis jets, whose afterglow may become detectable at late times, particularly at radio wavelengths. Here, we present Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array radio observations (rest frame times of $\\sim 3$-$4\\times10^{3}$ days post SN discovery) of a sample of 14 SNe Ic-bl discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) that have been demonstrated to originate from the same host environments as the SNe Ic-bl associated with nearby GRBs. Of the 14 SNe, we identify three that are radio detected, one of which (PTF10tqv, $z = 0.0795$) is consistent with an off-axis jet with energy similar to classical GRBs (${\\sim 10^{51}}$-${10^{51.7}~}$erg). Using recently developed synchrotron radiation code, we find that for our 11 non-detections, which are among the deepest limits obtained for Ic-bl, we rule out an off-axis jet with an energy of $\\gtrsim 10^{51}~{\\rm erg}$ in circumburst densities of $\\gtrsim 10^{-1}~{\\rm cm}^{-3}$. We predict that well-spaced monitoring of newly discovered SNe Ic-bl from $\\sim 10~$days to $\\sim 10~$years (rest frame) to luminosities of $\\sim 10^{27}~{\\rm erg~s}^{-1}~{\\rm Hz}^{-1}$ will constrain the existence of highly off-axis jets ($\\gtrsim60^\\circ$) with classical GRB energies.

      "abstract": "Utilizing Maximum Variability to Discern TDE Emission from AGN Flares Samaresh Mondal, K. Decker French 15 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) X-ray emission arising from active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity may potentially mimic the expected emission of tidal disruption events (TDEs). Ongoing and upcoming wide-field X-ray surveys will detect thousands of TDE-like sources, and classifying them securely as TDEs or AGNs is a challenging task. To this aim, we measure the average X-ray variability of AGNs and derive a threshold of maximum variation as a function of time separating the TDEs from AGN flares. For the comparison between TDE and AGN X-ray variability, we cross-match the publicly available XMM-Newton and Swift-XRT point source catalogs with the Million Quasars Catalog and optically selected TDEs. Then we compute the X-ray structure function (SF) and maximum variability of the AGN and TDE samples. The X-ray SF of AGNs has a power-law index $\\gamma\\sim0.11-0.14$ when fitted with a simple power-law model. However, the SF of AGNs is best described by a broken power-law or a power exponential model with a damping time scale $\\tau=950\\pm300$ days. The maximum variability comparison between TDE and simulated AGN light curves indicates they have a similar order of variation on a time scale of less than 20 days. However, at a longer time scale of $\\sim20$ days or more, the large-scale variations expected from power-law-like decay in TDEs become less frequent in AGNs. Furthermore, we compare the maximum variability of eROSITA TDE candidates with AGN, finding that many of the eROSITA-DE TDE candidates are consistent with flares from AGNs, and may not be TDEs.",

Cornejo 40 pages, 19 figures, 10 tables, accepted for publication on MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) orbiting the Milky Way are widely regarded as systems supported by velocity dispersion against self-gravity, and as prime targets for the search for indirect dark matter (DM) signatures in the GeV-to-TeV $\\gamma$-ray range owing to their lack of astrophysical $\\gamma$-ray background. We present forecasts of the sensitivity of the forthcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) to annihilating or decaying DM signals in these targets. An original selection of candidates is performed from the current catalogue of known objects, including both classical and ultra-faint dSphs. For each, the expected DM content is derived using the most comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic data available, within a consistent framework of analysis. This approach enables the derivation of novel astrophysical factor profiles for indirect DM searches, which are compared with results from the literature. From an initial sample of 64 dSphs, eight promising targets are identified -- Draco I, Coma Berenices, Ursa Major II, Ursa Minor and Willman 1 in the North, Reticulum II, Sculptor and Sagittarius II in the South -- for which different DM density models yield consistent expectations, leading to robust predictions. CTAO is expected to provide the strongest limits above $\\sim$10 TeV, reaching velocity-averaged annihilation cross sections of $\\sim$5$\\times$10$^{-25}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and decay lifetimes up to $\\sim$10$^{26}$ s for combined limits. The dominant uncertainties arise from the imprecise determination of the DM content, particularly for ultra-faint dSphs. Observation strategies are proposed that optimise either deep exposures of the best candidates or diversified target selections.",

Álvarez-Hernández, J. Casares, D. Mata Sánchez, S. K. Rout, S. Navarro Published in Astronomy & Astrophysics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The neutron star X-ray transient MAXI J1807+132 has undergone outbursts in 2017, 2019, and 2023. We conducted an $R$-band time series photometry campaign using the Isaac Newton Telescope during the 2022 quiescent state. We detected a periodic variation in the light curve, consistent with ellipsoidal modulation, which allowed us to determine an orbital period of $P_{\\rm orb} = 4.258 \\pm 0.008$ hr. By modelling the light curve, we obtained a binary inclination of $ i = 72\\pm5 \\, °$ and a mass ratio $q = 0.24^{+0.19}_{-0.14}$ ($68$ per cent confidence level). Furthermore, our analysis supports an early M-dwarf companion that contributes between 30 and 50 per cent to the total flux in the $R$-band. We extend the previously established absolute magnitude versus orbital period correlation for black hole X-ray transients to neutron star systems. We applied the correlation to MAXI J1807+132, estimating its distance as $6.3 \\pm 0.7$ kpc and its height above the Galactic plane to be $1.6 \\pm 0.2$ kpc.",

Ritter 17 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables, accepted for publication in A&A, movies available at this Youtube channel: this https URL Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Mass transfer is crucial in binary evolution, yet its theoretical treatment has long relied on analytic models whose key assumptions remain debated. We present a direct and systematic evaluation of these assumptions using high-resolution 3D hydrodynamical simulations including the Coriolis force. We simulate streams overflowing from both the inner and outer Lagrangian points, quantify mass transfer rates, and compare them with analytic solutions. We introduce scaling factors, including the overfilling factor, to render the problem dimensionless. The donor-star models are simplified, with either an isentropic initial stratification and adiabatic evolution or an isothermal structure and evolution, but the scalability of this formulation allows us to extend the results for a mass-transferring system to arbitrarily small overfilling factors for the adiabatic case. We find that the Coriolis force -- often neglected in analytic models -- strongly impacts the stream morphology: breaking axial symmetry, reducing the stream cross section, and shifting its origin toward the donor's trailing side. Contrary to common assumptions, the sonic surface is not flat and does not always intersect the Lagrangian point: instead, it is concave and shifted, particularly toward the accretor's trailing side. Despite these structural asymmetries, mass transfer rates are only mildly suppressed relative to analytic predictions and the deviation is remarkably small -- within a factor of two (ten) for the inner (outer) Lagrangian point over seven orders of magnitude in mass ratio. We use our results to extend the widely-used mass-transfer rate prescriptions by Ritter(1988) and Kolb&Ritter(1990), for both the inner and outer Lagrangian points. These extensions can be readily adopted in stellar evolution codes like MESA, with minimal changes where the original models are already in use.",

Rodríguez-González 14 pages; 9 figures; 2 tables; accepted in MNRAS Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a suite of dynamical simulations designed to explore the orbital and accretion properties of compact (2$-$7 AU) symbiotic systems, focusing on wind accretion, drag forces, and tidal interactions. Using three levels of physical complexity, we model systems of accreting white dwarfs (WDs) with masses of 0.7, 1.0, and 1.2 M$_\\odot$ orbiting evolving Solar-like stars with 1, 2, and 3 M$_\\odot$. We show that systems alternate between standard wind accretion and Wind Roche Lobe Overflow (WRLO) regimes during periods of high mass-loss rate experienced by the donor star (the peak of red giant phase and/or thermal pulses). For some configurations, the standard wind accretion has mass accretion efficiencies similar to those obtained by WRLO regime. Tidal forces play a key role in compact systems, leading to orbital shrinkage and enhanced accretion efficiency. We find that systems with high-mass WDs ($\\geq 1$ M$_\\odot$) and massive donors (2$-$3 M$_\\odot$) are the only ones to reach the Chandrasekhar limit. Interestingly, the majority of our simulations reach the Roche lobe overflow condition that is not further simulated given the need of more complex hydrodynamical simulations. Our analysis shows that increasing physical realism, by including drag and tides, systematically leads to more compact final orbital configurations. Comparison with compact known symbiotic systems seems to suggest that they are very likely experiencing orbital decay produced by tidal forces.",

Our understanding of bar evolution, both theoretically and through analysis of simulations indicates that bars both grow in amplitude and slow down over time through interaction and angular momentum exchange with the galaxy's dark matter halo. Understanding the physical mechanisms underlying this coupling requires modelling of the structural deformations to the potential that are mutually induced between components. In this work we use Basis Function Expansion (BFE) in combination with multichannel Singular Spectral Analysis (mSSA) as a non-parametric analysis tool to illustrate the coupling between the bar and the dark halo in a single high-resolution isolated barred disc galaxy simulation. We demonstrate the power of mSSA to extract and quantify explicitly coupled dynamical modes, determining growth rates, pattern speeds and phase lags for different stages of evolution of the stellar bar and the dark matter response. BFE & mSSA together grant us the ability to explore the importance and physical mechanisms of bar-halo coupling, and other dynamically coupled structures across a wide range of dynamical environments.",

Rodríguez Morales Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Low-mass black holes hosted by dwarf galaxies offer valuable insights into galaxy formation and the growth of the massive black holes found in massive galaxies. Their detection as AGN is challenging due to their low luminosity and compact size. This can be circumvented employing multi-wavelength observational strategies, such as combining optical and radio observations, which enables the detection of AGN features that may be hidden in single-wavelength analyses We aim to detect any jet-like emission indicative of the presence of an AGN in a sample of four dwarf galaxies with AGN signatures based on spatially resolved emission line diagnostic diagrams with SDSS MaNGA. Confirming the presence of an AGN will prove IFU spectroscopy to be a resourceful tool for identifying hidden or switched-off AGN. Using VLA radio observations, we image the radio emission of the four dwarf galaxies and derive their integrated radio flux and luminosity. We compare these to that expected from star formation processes to determine the origin of the radio emission and probe if it is consistent with the results of the emission line diagnostic diagrams. We find that one out of the four galaxies shows AGN radio emission consistent with the analysis of the MaNGA IFU data. The kinetic jet power of this source is Qjet ~ 1e42 erg / s, indicating that dwarf galaxies can host radio jets as powerful as those of massive radio galaxies. This galaxy exhibits an AGN outflow able to escape the gravitational bound produced by the dark matter halo, along with a decrease in the star formation rate of the central region. This suggests the presence of negative feedback from the AGN, which could be suppressing star formation. The other three galaxies exhibit regions of radio emission consistent with a stellar origin and overlapping with the star-forming regions found in the IFU spectroscopy.",

By exploiting the synergy with ground-based IFU ERIS observations, we conduct a comprehensive and resolved study of the interstellar medium (ISM) and stellar properties, from rest optical to near-IR, via emission-line diagnostics, resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of high-resolution imaging, and Pa$\\beta$ line detection in NIRCam WFSS data. Our analysis reveals massive ($M_{\\star}\\simeq$(0.67-3.5)$\\times$10$^{9}$ $M_{\\odot}$) SF clumps with star formation rates (SFRs) ~3-24 $M_{\\odot}$/yr, and quite low dust attenuation ($A_V\\simeq$0.4), electron density ($n_{e}$<300 cm$^{-3}$), and ionisation (log(U)$\\simeq -3.0$). The central bulge turns out to be modestly massive ($M_{\\star}$=(7$\\pm$3)$\\times$10$^{9}$ M$_{\\odot}$), heavily obscured ($A_V$=6.43$\\pm$0.55), and likely to have formed most of its stellar mass in the past (SFR=82$\\pm$42 $M_{\\odot}$/yr over the last 100 Myr), yet still forming stars at a lower rate (SFR=12$\\pm$8 M$_{\\odot}$/yr over the last 10 Myr). We infer a metallicity 12+log(O/H)~8.54 and an apparent enhancement of the N/O abundance (log(N/O)$\\simeq -1.0$) in all distinct galaxy regions, a likely consequence of dilution effects due to radial inflows of metal-poor gas. We measure a sub-solar sulfur abundance (log(S/O)$\\simeq$-1.9). Finally, the radial stellar age profile reveals older stellar populations in the inner galaxy regions compared to the outskirts, pointing to an inside-out growth of K20-ID7.",

Comments are welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Galaxy-scale outflows are of critical importance for galaxy formation and evolution. Dust grains are the main sites for the formation of molecules needed for star formation but are also important for the acceleration of outflows that can remove the gas reservoir critical for stellar mass growth. Using the MIRI medium-resolution integral field spectrograph aboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we detect the 3.28 $\\mu$m aromatic and the 3.4 $\\mu$m aliphatic hydrocarbon dust features in absorption in a redshift 4.601 hot dust-obscured galaxy, blue-shifted by $\\Delta$V=$-5250^{+276}_{-339}$ kms$^{-1}$ from the systemic redshift of the galaxy. The extremely high velocity of the dust indicates that the wind was accelerated by radiation pressure from the central quasar. These results pave a novel way for probing the physics of dusty outflows in active galaxies at early cosmic time.",

Kraan-Korteweg, Roger Ianjamasimanana Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a new catalog of 196 galaxies of the nearby Hydra I cluster out to $\\sim$1.75$\\rm r_{200}$, consisting of broad u,g,r,i,z along with narrowband H${\\alpha}$ measurements. These deep optical images were obtained with the DECam camera (CTIO) and reach down to a surface brightness limit of $\\mu( 3\\sigma;10''\\times10'')$=26.9 mag $\\rm arcsec^2$ in the g band. We also report the HI properties for 89 cluster members detected with MeerKAT. A color magnitude diagram (CMD) shows a bimodal distribution typical of a cluster population, more evolved than those found in isolation. We combine optical H${\\alpha}$ and WISE infrared data to compare the star formation history at two distinct timescales. Differences in the star forming activity depicted by both populations manifest as starburst in 24 found members. Of these, 18 starburst galaxies have neutral gas measurements, and show disturbed HI disks that suggest an environmentally-triggered boost in star formation within the last 10$^7$ yrs. Processes such as ram pressure stripping or tidal interactions may underlie their enhanced star-forming activity and asymmetric disks. Since Hydra's dynamical history is unclear, we examine the spatial and velocity distribution of the sample. We reveal a possible link between the large scale structure feeding the Hydra I cluster and the heightened star-forming activity of the starburst galaxies. This feeding pattern matches the few substructure that has been identified in Hydra in previous works, and may explain its origin. Our results portray a picture of a cluster with an evolved nature, plus a population of new infalling galaxies that manifest the impact of their first contact with the cluster environment through star formation, color, morphology and gas content transformations.",

With the accuracy and completeness of data from Gaia Data Release 3, we now have new opportunities to detect reliable members of stellar groups across a larger field of view than in previous studies. In this work, using machine learning methods and high-accuracy data, we investigate the possibility of detecting multiple structures within 500 arcmin of ASCC 32. We first applied DBSCAN to proper motion and parallax, as multiple structures tend to share similar values for these parameters. Next, we applied GMM to position, proper motion, and parallax for the members detected by DBSCAN. This approach allowed us to identify a filamentary structure among the DBSCAN-detected members. This structure contains all stellar groups previously identified in this region. Subsequently, based on the BIC score, we applied GMM to this filamentary structure. Since multiple structures exhibit distinct positional distributions, GMM was able to effectively separate all groups within the filament. Our methods successfully identified ASCC 32, OC 0395, and HSC 1865 within a 500 arcmin radius. Additionally, we found two distinct substructures within ASCC 32. These four groups exhibit a single main-sequence distribution in the CMD, with proper motion values within three times the standard deviation and slightly differing parallax values, despite having distinct spatial structures. Furthermore, these four groups share the same radial velocity distribution. We provide documentation demonstrating the formation of these stellar groups as a multiple structure, with improved membership identification compared to previous studies.",

Studies comparing those type II AGN with type I AGN at that epoch have reinforced the long-standing idea of an evolutionary link between those classes of objects. Mergers, the idea goes, disturb the morphologies and angular momentum of galaxies. The disruption of angular momentum allows material to be funneled toward galactic cores, sparking AGN activity and potentially also a burst of star-formation. That material enshrouds the galactic nucleus, leading to a type II AGN. Later, AGN feedback clears the circumnuclear dust, leading to a transition into a type I AGN, and also quenches star formation. If this is a common outcome, a class of intermediate objects should exist. Such objects would be somewhat disturbed and dusty and sit below the star-forming galaxy main sequence, and their star-formation histories would show an increase in star-formation at around the time of the suspected merger. We present new JWST observations of SDSSJ2222+2745, a strongly lensed AGN at z=2.801. The lensing magnification enables a detailed study of the host galaxy spanning the rest-ultraviolet through near infrared. JWST and HST photometry, morphological models, and models of the host's spectral energy distribution reveal that SDSSJ2222+2745 is actively transitioning from a type II to type I AGN. Catching a lensed AGN at this special evolutionary phase makes SDSSJ2222+2745 a unique laboratory to study the physical processes involved in the transition and their relationships to the AGN and the host galaxy at incredible spatial-resolution down to about 20pc at z=2.801.",

Helmi 17 pages, 16 figures, accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The precision of cluster parameter determination has significantly improved with the availability of homogeneous photometric Gaia data, however, challenges such as age-metallicity degeneracy and lack of spectroscopic observations remain. In this paper we investigate whether metallicities derived from low-resolution Gaia XP spectra can be effectively used to break degeneracies and improve the accuracy of OC parameter determinations. We analysed 20 OCs using isochrone fitting methods on Gaia DR3 photometry and metallicity estimates from several Gaia XP-based catalogues. We derived age, distance modulus, and extinction using the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). We compared the parameter estimates to the values obtained in other works through isochrone fitting with spectroscopically constrained metallicities or through neural network techniques applied only to the photometry. We found the systematic difference between Gaia XP derived metallicities and those obtained from high-resolution spectroscopy to be 0.1-0.15 dex. We found a systematic age difference of <0.03 +- 0.13 dex compared to isochrone fitting using high-resolution spectroscopy, and <0.08 +- 0.21 dex compared to neural network-based methods, and a median individual error of ~0.065 dex. Despite their low resolution, Gaia XP metallicities effectively constrain parameters of clusters lacking a well-populated RGB. When used with stringent quality cuts and incorporated as priors, they allow to determine ages comparable in precision to those based on high-resolution spectroscopy and more precise than photometry-only neural network methods. These results highlight the potential of Gaia data for accurate cluster parameter analysis and detailed Galactic studies without relying on traditional spectroscopy.",

By combining the NB921 filter on HSC and the NB1244 filter on SWIMS, we can detect redshifted H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ emission lines from the supercluster. This unique technique allows us to measure both star formation rates and dust extinction for a sample of 94 emission-line galaxies across the supercluster. We find that dust extinction, estimated from the Balmer decrement (H$\\alpha$/H$\\beta$ ratio), increases with stellar mass in star-forming galaxies, whereas relatively quiescent systems exhibit comparatively low extinction. Among galaxies with intermediate masses ($10^{8.5} < M_* < 10^{10.5}\\,M_\\odot$), the dust-corrected H$\\alpha$-based star formation rates align with the main sequence at this epoch. More massive galaxies, however, deviate from this relation, exhibit redder colors, and reside predominantly in higher-density environments.

Gadotti, Myeong-gu Park, Yun Hee Lee, Francesca Fragkoudi, Minjin Kim, Woong-Tae Kim Accepted for publication in ApJ, 16 pages, 8 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Dark gaps, low surface brightness regions along the bar minor axis, are expected to form as a consequence of secular evolution in barred galaxies. Although several studies have proposed links between dark gap locations and dynamical resonances, the results remain inconclusive. Using DESI Legacy Imaging Survey data, we find that approximately 61% of barred galaxies exhibit pronounced dark gaps. We compare the location of dark gaps with resonance radii derived from the Tremaine-Weinberg method applied to MaNGA data for the same galaxies. Our analysis shows that dark gaps do not preferentially form at specific resonances. Instead, their locations correlate with $\\mathcal{R}$ $\\equiv$ $R_{CR}/R_{Bar}$: slow bars tend to show shorter dark gap radii, while fast bars show longer ones. This trend reflects a tight relation between bar length and dark gap radius. However, when barred galaxies are classified by their ring morphology, certain types exhibit dark gaps that align with specific resonances. Notably, dark gaps located between the inner and outer rings are closely associated with the corotation radius. In galaxies with two dark gaps along the bar minor axis profile, the inner dark gap typically aligns with the ultraharmonic resonance, and the outer dark gap corresponds to the corotation radius. These findings suggest that some morphological types share similar $\\mathcal{R}$ values and exhibit dark gaps near specific resonances. Thus, dark gaps may serve as proxies for dynamical resonances only in certain systems. Our findings may help explain the discrepancies observed in earlier studies.",

GAS is a Large Program at the Green Bank Telescope to map all Gould Belt star-forming regions with $A_\\mathrm{V} \\gtrsim 7$~mag visible from the northern hemisphere in emission from NH$_3$ and other key molecular tracers. This final release includes the data for all the regions observed: Heiles Cloud 2 and B18 in Taurus; Barnard 1, Barnard 1-E, IC348, NGC 1333, L1448, L1451, and Per7/34 in Perseus; L1688 and L1689 in Ophiuchus; Orion A (North and South) and Orion B in Orion; Cepheus, B59 in Pipe; Corona Australis (CrA) East and West; IC5146; and Serpens Aquila and MWC297 in Serpens. Similar to what was presented in GAS DR1, we find that the NH$_3$ emission and dust continuum emission from Herschel correspond closely. We find that the NH$_3$ emission is generally extended beyond the typical 0.1 pc length scales of dense cores, and we find that the transition between coherent core and turbulent cloud is a common result. This shows that the regions of coherence are common throughout different star forming regions, with a substantial fraction of the high column density regions displaying subsonic non-thermal velocity dispersions. We produce maps of the gas kinematics, temperature, and NH$_3$ column densities through forward modeling of the hyperfine structure of the NH$_3$ (1,1) and (2,2) lines. We show that the NH$_3$ velocity dispersion, $\\sigma_v$, and gas kinetic temperature, $T_{\\rm kin}$, vary systematically between the regions included in this release, with an increase in both the mean value and spread of $\\sigma_v$ and $T_{\\rm kin}$ with increasing star formation activity.

The Extinction Curve Lucía Bravo Ferres, Francisco Nogueras-Lara, Rainer Schödel, Rubén Fedriani, Adam Ginsburg, Samuel Crowe, Jonathan C. Tan, Morten Andersen, Joseph Armstrong, Yu Cheng, Zhi-Yun Li 14 pages, 11 figures, revised version after first referee report, submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Determining the infrared extinction curve towards the Galactic centre is crucial for accurately correcting observed data and deriving the underlying stellar populations. However, extinction curves reported in the literature often show discrepancies. We aim to derive the infrared extinction curve towards the Galactic centre based on JWST-NIRCam data for the first time, using observations of the Sagittarius C region in the 1-5 $\\mu$m range. We determined extinction ratios using two different methods, both based on measuring the reddening vector using the slope of red clump stars, whose intrinsic properties are well known, in observed colour-magnitude diagrams. The extinction curve derived in this work is in good agreement with previous results in the literature. We obtained the following extinction ratios relative to F162M: $A_\\mathrm{F115W} : A_\\mathrm{F162M} : A_\\mathrm{F182M} : A_\\mathrm{F212N} : A_\\mathrm{F360M} : A_\\mathrm{F405N} : A_\\mathrm{F470N} : A_\\mathrm{F480M} = 1.84 \\pm 0.03 : 1.00 : 0.789 \\pm 0.005 : 0.607 \\pm 0.014 : 0.306 \\pm 0.011 : 0.248 \\pm 0.017 : 0.240 \\pm 0.019 : 0.21 \\pm 0.03$. Besides, we found different values of the extinction index for the short- ($\\lambda \\sim 1-2.5\\,\\mu$m, $\\alpha \\sim 2$) and long-wavelength ($\\lambda \\sim 2.5-5\\,\\mu$m, $\\alpha \\sim 1.4$) regimes, with the extinction curve flattening at longer wavelengths. Comparison with extinction curves derived both inside and outside the Galactic centre suggests that the infrared extinction curve does not significantly vary in the central regions, and shows no significant evidence for variations between different lines of sight beyond the inner Galaxy within the uncertainties.",

We analyze a spectroscopic sample of 34 Type 1 AGNs from the JWST Advanced Deep Survey (JADES) survey, spanning redshifts 1.7 < z < 9, to constrain the physical nature of the accretion flows powering these sources with broad-line diagnostics statistically for the first time. At z > 5, we find a marked suppression of high-ionization emission lines (HeII, CIV, NV) relative to prominent broad Halpha and narrow [OIII] features. This contrast places strong constraints on the shape of the ionizing spectral energy distribution (SED) and on the physical conditions in the broad-line region (BLR). By comparing the observations to photoionization models based on SEDs of black holes accreting at sub-Eddington ratios, we show that standard AGN continua struggle to reproduce the observed broad line ratios and equivalent widths across a wide ionization parameter range. These results suggest the need for modified SEDs -- either intrinsically softened due to super-Eddington accretion or radiative inefficiencies in the innermost disk, or externally filtered by intervening optically thick gas that absorbs or scatters the highest-energy photons before they reach the BLR.",

Here we present four new `surrogate' models, all built with the Nexus framework. The simulations contain stars, dark matter and gas. Our most sophisticated model allows gas to evolve thermodynamically, and includes star formation, metal production, and stellar feedback. The other three models in this work have an isothermal gas disc. We examine these new simulations in the context of cold gas observations of the Galaxy. Our focus is the so-called `HI terminal velocity curve' - a heliocentric measurement of the maximum Vlos as a function of Galactic longitude, which dates back to the early days of radio astronomy. It is a powerful approach to indirectly estimating the gas dynamics because it does not require knowledge about the distance to individual gas clouds, which is difficult to estimate. A comparison of the terminal velocities and recovered rotation curve values in the simulations against observations suggests that our models are in need of further refinement. The gravitational torques associated with our synthetic bars are too strong, driving excessive streaming motion in the inner gas disc. This causes the simulated terminal velocity curves in the Galactic Quadrant I and IV to deviate substantially from each other, unlike what is seen in observed HI terminal velocities of the MW. We suggest possible ways forward for future models.",

Here in Paper II, we report an expansion of our X-ray and infrared analysis of Seyfert-luminosity host galaxies with four additional metrics to the single-metric morphology analysis of Paper I, as well as new samples of inactive control galaxies. This expanded study of one of the largest and most complete, multi-wavelength samples of AGN detected at $0.6<z<2.4$ in the GOODS-South and North fields, confirms that mergers surprisingly play a significant role in obscured, sub-quasar AGN host galaxies. Additionally, the pattern of morphological disturbances observed amongst the X-ray- and mid-IR-selected AGN suggests that these represent different phases of AGN evolution tied to a major-merger timeline, as opposed to distinct populations of AGN. These results indicate that mergers are important in triggering sub-quasar AGN at these redshifts.",

Jacob, Marco Padovani, Daniele Galli, Ana López-Sepulcre, Ningyu Tang, Di Li, Jing Zhou, Pei Zuo 18 pages, 13 figures. A&A accepted Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Methylidyne (CH) has long been considered a reliable tracer of molecular gas in the low-to-intermediate extinction range. Although extended CH 3.3 GHz emission is commonly observed in diffuse and translucent clouds, observations in cold, dense clumps are rare. In this work, we conducted high-sensitivity CH observations toward 27 PGCCs with the Arecibo 305m telescope. Toward each source, the CH data were analyzed in conjunction with $^{13}$CO (1--0), HINSA, and H$_2$ column densities. Our results revealed ubiquitous subsonic velocity dispersions of CH, in contrast to $^{13}$CO, which is predominantly supersonic. The findings suggest that subsonic CH emissions may trace dense, low-turbulent gas structures in PGCCs. To investigate environmental effects, particularly the cosmic-ray ionization rate (CRIR), we estimated CRIR upper limits from HINSA, yielding values from $(8.1\\pm4.7)\\times10^{-18}$ to $(2.0\\pm0.8)\\times10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$ ($N_{H_2}$ from $(1.7\\pm0.2)\\times10^{21}$ to $(3.6\\pm0.4)\\times10^{22}$~cm$^{-2}$). This result favors theoretical predictions of a cosmic-ray attenuation model, in which the interstellar spectra of low-energy CR protons and electrons match {\\it Voyager} measurements, although alternative models cannot yet be ruled out. The abundance of CH decreases with increasing column density, while showing a positive dependence on the CRIR, which requires atomic oxygen not heavily depleted to dominate CH destruction in PGCCs. By fitting the abundance of CH with an analytic formula, we place constraints on atomic O abundance ($2.4\\pm0.4\\times10^{-4}$ with respect to total H) and C$^+$ abundance ($7.4\\pm0.7\\times10^{13}\\zeta_2/n_{\\rm H_2}$). These findings indicate that CH formation is closely linked to the C$^+$ abundance, regulated by cosmic-ray ionization, while other processes, such as turbulent diffusive transport, might also contribute a non-negligible effect.",

Goicoechea, John Black, Ryan Chown, Ameek Sidhu, Emilie Habart, Els Peeters, Olivier Berné Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The James Webb Space Telescope enabled the first detection of several rovibrational emission lines of HD in the Orion Bar, a prototypical photodissociation region. This provides an incentive to examine the physics of HD in dense and strong PDRs. Using the latest data available on HD excitation by collisional, radiative and chemical processes, our goal is to unveil HD formation and excitation processes in PDRs by comparing our state-of-the-art PDR model with observations made in the Orion Bar and discuss if and how HD can be used as a complementary tracer of physical parameters in the emitting region. We compute detailed PDR models, using an upgraded version of the Meudon PDR code, which are compared to NIRSpec data using excitation diagrams and synthetic emission spectra. The models predict that HD is mainly produced in the gas phase via the reaction D + H2 = H + HD at the front edge of the PDR and that the D/HD transition is located slightly closer to the edge than the H/H2 transition. Rovibrational levels are excited by UV pumping. In the observations, HD rovibrational emission is detected close to the H/H2 dissociation fronts of the Orion Bar and peaks where vibrationally excited H2 peaks, rather than at the maximum emission of pure rotational H2 levels. We derive an excitation temperature around Tex ~ 480 - 710 K. Due to high continuum in the Orion Bar, fringes lead to high noise levels beyond 15 $\\mu$m, no pure rotational lines of HD are detected. The comparison to PDR models shows that a range of thermal pressure P = (3-9)x10$^7$ K cm$^{-3}$ with no strong constraints on the intensity of the UV field are compatible with HD observations. This range of pressure is compatible with previous estimates from H2 observations with JWST. This is the first time that observations of HD emission lines in the near-infrared are used to put constraints on the thermal pressure in the PDR.",

The chemical and dynamical structure of the Galaxy retains the imprint of such events, including a major accretion episode around 8-10 Gyr ago. Recent findings suggest that present-day orbital energy correlates with stellar chemistry and birth location within the merging progenitor galaxy. Using a high-resolution NIHAO-UHD cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way analogue, we trace the birth positions, ages, and present-day orbits of stars accreted in its last major merger. We show that stars born in the progenitor's core are more tightly bound to the Milky Way and chemically enriched, while those from the outskirts are less bound and metal-poor. This supports the scenario proposed by Skúladóttir et al. (2025) using idealised simulations, now demonstrated in a cosmological context. The preserved chemodynamical memory is also evident in elemental planes such as [Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn], reflecting gradients in star formation efficiency. The median abundance trends for different orbital energies are broadly similar, though less pronounced and more non-linear than the linear relations reported by Skúladóttir et al. (2025), with relatively good agreement at the highest metallicities. Our results reveal that spatial and temporal memory is retained across the merger -- connecting birth locations to present-day properties like a golden thread. We demonstrate that selection methods in integrals-of-motion space systematically bias progenitor reconstructions by missing its enriched core, and we outline strategies to obtain a more representative census of accreted stars.",

Submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present spatially resolved rest-optical spectroscopy of 38 star-forming galaxies at 0.5 < z < 1.7 from the JWST/NIRSpec MSA-3D survey, which uses slit-stepping to build IFU-like datacubes at 0.1'' resolution. We map emission-line morphology, excitation, and kinematics of the warm ionized gas using [N II]/H$\\alpha$, [S II]/H$\\alpha$, and [O III]/H$\\beta$. Relative to z$\\sim$0 galaxies at fixed stellar mass, our sources show systematically lower [N II]/H$\\alpha$ and [S II]/H$\\alpha$ and elevated [O III]/H$\\beta$, consistent with harder radiation fields and lower metallicities. Radially, [O III]/H$\\beta$ profiles are typically flat or mildly positive, whereas [N II]/H$\\alpha$ also remains flat or declines outward, mirroring metallicity trends. On kpc scales, we find a strong positive correlation between [N II]/H$\\alpha$ and velocity dispersion ($\\sigma$), linking local excitation to turbulent or shock-driven kinematics. Six galaxies ($\\sim$ 16% of the sample) host spatially localized regions with elevated [N II]/H$\\alpha$, high EW(H$\\alpha$), and V_RMS = $\\sqrt{V^2 + \\sigma^2} > 200$ km/s, indicative of weak AGN activity, shocks, or outflows. For these candidates we infer modest warm-ionized outflow rates of 1-4 Msun/yr and kinetic powers $\\sim$ 0.1-1% of the AGN bolometric luminosity (from central [O III] or H$\\alpha$). These values place our sample at the low-energy tail of known AGN-driven outflows yet in continuity with $\\dot{M_{out}}-L_{AGN}$ scaling relations across 0 < z < 6. A completeness assessment shows MSA-3D is sensitive to AGN with $L_{AGN} \\geq 10^{43}$ erg/s, underscoring both the promise and current limitations of detecting weak AGN activity in distant galaxies with resolved spectroscopy.",

Submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Neutral gas in galaxies during the Epoch of Reionisation regulates star formation, dust growth, and the escape of ionising photons, making it a key ingredient in understanding both galaxy assembly and reionisation. Yet, direct constraints on the HI content of galaxies at z>6 have been scarce. With JWST, Ly$\\alpha$ damping wings in galaxy spectra can now provide a direct probe of this neutral component. We analyse JWST/NIRSpec prism spectra of 12 UV-luminous galaxies from the REBELS-IFU program at z~6.5-7.7, deriving HI column densities by modelling Ly$\\alpha$ damping wings. Significant damped Ly$\\alpha$ absorption is detected in eight galaxies, with $N_{\\mathrm{HI}}\\gtrsim10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. We use the column densities and sizes derived for these sources to estimate their HI mass and compare with $L_{\\mathrm{[CII]}}$-$M_{\\mathrm{HI}}$ calibrations. The resulting HI masses show a tentative correlation with those inferred from [CII], although the [CII]-based estimates are systematically larger, suggesting that the HI reservoirs may extend beyond the [CII]-emitting gas. We also combine the DLA-based measurements with FIR-derived dust-to-gas ratios, dust attenuation, and gas-phase metallicities. No correlation is found between DLA-based and FIR-based dust-to-gas ratios, but combining the REBELS-IFU sample with literature samples at lower metallicities reveals a strong correlation between $A_{\\mathrm{V}}/N_{\\mathrm{HI}}$ and metallicity. These findings suggest that by $z\\sim7$ massive galaxies can already host substantial, enriched reservoirs of neutral gas and dust, consistent with $A_{\\mathrm{V}}$/$N_{\\mathrm{HI}}$-metallicity trends at lower redshift. At the highest redshifts ($z>8$), however, we see tentative evidence for systematically lower $A_{\\mathrm{V}}$/$N_{\\mathrm{HI}}$ at fixed metallicity, which may point to pristine gas accretion or more efficient dust destruction/expulsion.",

[OIII] catalogue release after acceptance. Comments welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a spectroscopically-selected [OIII]+Hb emitters catalogue at 6.75<z<9.05 and the resulting [OIII] 5008 ÅLuminosity Function (LF) in the COSMOS field. We leverage the 0.3 deg$^{2}$ covered to date by COSMOS-3D using NIRCam/WFSS F444W (90% of the survey) to perform the largest spectroscopic search for [OIII] emitters at 6.75<z<9.05. We present our catalogue of 237 [OIII] emitters and their associated completeness function. The inferred constraints on the [OIII] LF enable us to characterise the knee of the [OIII] LF, resulting in improved [OIII] LF constraints at z~7,8. Notably, we find evidence for an accelerated decline of the [OIII] luminosity density between z~7 and z~8, which could be expected if the metallicity of [OIII] emitters, as well as the cosmic star-formation rate density, is declining at these redshifts. We find that theoretical models that reproduce the z~7,8 [OIII] LF do not reproduce well the [OIII] equivalent width distribution, pointing to potential challenges in the modelling of[OIII] and other nebular lines in the early Universe. Finally, we provide the first constraints on the cosmic variance of [OIII] emitters, estimating at 15% the relative uncertainty for the z~7,8 [OIII] LF in the 0.3 deg$^2$ field. This estimate is in good agreement with that inferred from clustering, and shows that the [OIII] LF derived from smaller extragalactic legacy fields is strongly affected by cosmic variance. Our results highlight the fundamental role that wide-area JWST slitless surveys play to map the galaxy large-scale structure down into the reionisation era, serving as a springboard for a variety of science cases.",

Ditrani, Giovanna Giardino, Karl Glazebrook, Valentina La Torre, Jamie Lin, Adam Muzzin, Namrata Roy, Paola Santini, Benedetta Vulcani, Peter J. Watson, Xin Wang Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We report the spectroscopic detection of neutral gas inflow into a massive ($M_* \\simeq 4\\times 10^{10} M_\\odot$) quiescent galaxy observed at $z_{\\rm{spec}} = 2.6576$ with JWST. From the redshifted absorption of the NaI doublet at $\\lambda \\lambda 5890, 5896 $ Ang, we estimate an inflow velocity $v=278^{+79}_{-79}$ km s$^{-1}$ and a column density $\\log(N_{NaI}/\\rm{cm^2}) = 13.02^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$. We derive the inflowing mass of the gas $M_{in} = 1.6^{+0.1}_{-0.1} \\times 10^8 M_\\odot$ and rate $\\dot{M}_{in} = 19^{+6}_{-7} \\, M_\\odot \\, \\rm{yr}^{-1}$. The presence of several surrounding galaxies suggests that the galaxy may be accreting gas from nearby companions. However, we cannot confirm it with current data and the intergalactic medium or cosmic filaments are also viable sources of the inflowing gas. Despite the ongoing inflow, the galaxy remains quiescent, with an upper limit to the star formation rate of $0.2 \\, M_\\odot \\, \\rm{yr}^{-1}$. Moreover, its star formation history suggests that the galaxy has remained quiescent during the past $\\sim1$ Gyr, with half of its stars formed by redshift $z_{50}=11^{+18}_{-3}$. We discuss that the inflow is not massive, dense, or long-lived enough to ignite significant star formation, or it is fueling low-level AGN activity instead. This is direct evidence that quiescent galaxies can accrete cold gas after their quenching while keeping their star formation subdued. Follow-up observations with JWST and ALMA will be needed to constraint the nature of the inflowing gas.",

Martin, Livia Vallini, Xinfeng Xu Submitted to ApJL, 13 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are key diagnostics of the physical conditions in the interstellar medium and are widely used to trace star formation in the mid-infrared (mid-IR). The relative strengths of mid-IR PAH emission features (e.g., 6.2, 7.7, 11.3 um) are sensitive to both the size and ionization state of the molecules and can be strongly influenced by the local radiation field. However, at low metallicities ( Z < 0.2 Zsun), detecting PAHs remains notoriously difficult, likely reflecting a combination of suppressed formation and enhanced destruction mechanisms. We present new JWST/MIRI MRS observations of the metal-poor (Z = 0.1 Zsun) dwarf galaxy CGCG 007-025. We confirm the tentative PAH detection previously reported from Spitzer data and, for the first time, identify a compact (approx. 50 pc) PAH-emitting region nearly co-spatial with the newly detected [NeV](I.P. = 97 eV) emission and the galaxy's most metal-poor, strongly star-forming region. The 11.3 um PAH feature is clearly detected, while no emission is found from the other typically brighter features, suggesting a PAH population dominated by large, neutral molecules resilient to hard ionizing fields. When compared with models, mid-IR line ratios involving [NeIII], [OIV], and [NeV] can only be reproduced by a combination of star formation and AGN ionization, with the latter contributing 4--8%. The [OIV] and [NeV] luminosities exceed what massive stars or shocks can produce, highlighting a puzzling scenario in line with recent JWST observations of similar galaxies. This work provides a crucial reference for studying the physical conditions of the dust and star formation in low-metallicity starburst regions, environments typical of the early universe.",

Submitted to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We present JWST/NIRSpec dense-shutter spectroscopy (DSS). This novel observing strategy with the NIRSpec micro-shutter assembly (MSA) deliberately permits a high number of controlled spectral overlaps to reach extreme multiplex while retaining the low background of slit spectroscopy. In a single configuration over the JADES Origins Field we opened shutters on all faint (F444W<30 mag) z$_{\\rm phot}$>3 candidates in the MSA, prioritising emission-line science and rejecting only bright continuum sources. Using 33.6 and 35.8 ks on-source in G235M and G395M, we observed a single mask with ~850 sources, obtaining secure spectroscopic redshifts for ~540 galaxies over 2.5<z<8.9. The per-configuration target density in DSS mode is 4-5x higher than standard no- and low-overlap MSA strategies (<200 sources), with no loss in redshift precision or accuracy. Line-flux sensitivities are 30 percent lower at fixed exposure time, matching the expected increase in background noise, but the gain in survey speed is 5x in our setup, more than justifying the penalty. The measured line sensitivity exceeds NIRCam WFSS by a minimum factor of ~5 (i.e. ~25 in exposure time) at $\\lambda$~4 $\\mu$m, demonstrating that controlled overlap is a compelling method to gain deep, wide-band spectra for large samples. Crucially, we envisage the MSA could deliver even higher target allocation densities than what used here. We derive Balmer-line based SFRs, gas-phase metallicities (including a large sample suitable for strong-line calibrations), and identify rare sources (mini-quenched systems and broad-line AGN). This approach is immediately applicable wherever deep imaging enables robust pre-selection and astrometry, providing an efficient method to obtain large samples of faint emission-line galaxies, a compelling middle ground between the completeness of slitless surveys and the sensitivity and bandwidth of NIRSpec/MSA.",

Walker, A. Zenteno (DELVE and DES Collaboration) 20 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables; To be submitted to AAS Journals, Comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We report the discovery of three Milky Way satellite candidates: Carina IV, Phoenix III, and DELVE 7, in the third data release of the DECam Local Volume Exploration survey (DELVE). The candidate systems were identified by cross-matching results from two independent search algorithms. All three are extremely faint systems composed of old, metal-poor stellar populations ($\\tau \\gtrsim 10$ Gyr, [Fe/H] $ \\lesssim -1.4$). Carina IV ($M_V = -2.8;\\ r_{1/2} = 40 {\\rm pc}$) and Phoenix III ($M_V = -1.2;\\ r_{1/2} = 19 {\\rm pc}$) have half-light radii that are consistent with the known population of dwarf galaxies, while DELVE 7 ($M_V = 1.2;\\ r_{1/2} = 2 {\\rm pc}$) is very compact and seems more likely to be a star cluster, though its nature remains ambiguous without spectroscopic followup. The Gaia proper motions of stars in Carina IV ($M_* = 2250^{+1180}_{-830} {\\rm M_\\odot}$) indicate that it is unlikely to be associated with the LMC, while DECam CaHK photometry confirms that its member stars are metal-poor. Phoenix III ($M_* = 520^{+660}_{-290} {\\rm M_\\odot}$) is the faintest known satellite in the extreme outer stellar halo ($D_{\\rm GC} > 100$ kpc), while DELVE 7 ($M_* = 60^{+120}_{-40} {\\rm M_\\odot}$) is the faintest known satellite with $D_{\\rm GC} > 20$ kpc.",

Gladders Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) At present, the best opportunity for detailed Lyman Continuum escape studies is in gravitationally lensed galaxies at z >= 2. Only one such galaxy currently exists in the literature with sufficient spatial magnification: The Sunburst Arc at redshift z = 2.37. Here, we present rest-frame optical JWST NIRSpec integral field observations of the Sunburst Arc that cover a large fraction of the source plane. From this dataset, we generate precise maps of ISM kinematics, dust geometry, ionization, and chemical enrichment. We find that the galaxy rotates but also shows strong, possibly dominant, signatures of turbulence, which are indicative of recent or ongoing major interaction. The cluster that leaks ionizing photons shows little variation in kinematics or dust coverage, but dramatically elevated ionization, indicating that photoionization is the predominant mechanism that creates paths for LyC escape. We conjecture that tidal stripping of H I gas due to an interaction could have removed a large portion of the neutral ISM around the LyC emitting cluster, making it easier for the cluster to completely ionize the rest.",

Tielens, Alessandra Ricca Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) constitute a significant fraction of the Universe's carbon budget, playing a key role in the cosmic carbon cycle and dominating the mid-infrared spectra of astrophysical environments in which they reside. Although PAHs are known to form in the circumstellar envelopes of post-AGB stars, their formation and evolution are still not well-understood. We aim to understand how pristine complex hydrocarbons and PAHs in circumstellar environments transition to the PAHs observed in the ISM. The mid-infrared PAH spectra (5-18 micron) of the planetary nebula, NGC 7027, are investigated using spectral cubes from JWST MIRI-MRS. We report the first detection of spatially-resolved variations of the PAH spectral profiles across class A, AB, and B in all major PAH bands (6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.2 micron) within a single source, NGC 7027. These variations are linked to morphological structures within NGC 7027. Clear correlations are revealed between the 6.2, 7.7, and 8.6 micron features, where the red components (6.26, 7.8, 8.65 micron) exhibit a strong correlation and the same is found for the blue components of the 6.2 and 7.7 (6.205 and 7.6 micron). The blue component of the 8.6 (8.56 micron) appears to be independent of the other components. We link this behaviour to differences in molecular structure of their PAH subpopulations. Decomposition of the 11.2 micron band confirms two previously identified components, with the broader 11.25 micron component attributed to emission from very small grains of PAH clusters rather than PAH emission. We show that PAH profile classes generally vary with proximity to the central star's UV radiation field, suggesting class B PAHs represent more processed species while class A PAHs remain relatively pristine, challenging current notions on the spectral evolution of PAHs.",

A FITSmap portal to view the images is at this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We summarize the properties and initial data release of the JADES Origins Field (JOF), the longest single pointing yet imaged with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This field falls within the GOODS-S region about 8' south-west of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), where it was formed initially in Cycle 1 as a parallel field of HUDF spectroscopic observations within the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). This imaging was greatly extended in Cycle 2 program 3215, which observed the JOF for 5 days in six medium-band filters, seeking robust candidates for z>15 galaxies. This program also includes ultra-deep parallel NIRSpec spectroscopy (up to 91 hours on-source, summing over the dispersion modes) on the HUDF. Cycle 3 observations from program 4540 added 20 hours of NIRCam slitless spectroscopy and F070W imaging to the JOF. With these three campaigns, the JOF was observed for 380 open-shutter hours with NIRCam using 15 imaging filters and 2 grism bandpasses. Further, parts of the JOF have deep 43 hr MIRI observations in F770W. Taken together, the JOF is one of the most compelling deep fields available with JWST and a powerful window into the early Universe. This paper presents the second data release from JADES, featuring the imaging and catalogs from the year 1 JOF observations.",

The 5 arcsec long arc is the most highly magnified $z>10$ galaxy known. It straddles the lensing critical curve and reveals five star clusters with radii of $\\sim 1$ pc or less. We measure the full arc to have F200W 24.5 AB mag, consisting of two mirror images, each 25.3 AB mag with a median magnification of $\\mu \\sim 60^{+17}_{-8}$ (delensed 29.7 AB mag, $M_{UV} = -17.8$). The galaxy has an extremely strong Lyman break F115W$-$F200W $>3.2$ mag ($2\\sigma$ lower limit), is undetected in all bluer filters ($< 2\\sigma$), and has a very blue continuum slope redward of the break ($\\beta = -2.7 \\pm 0.1$). This results in a photometric redshift $z_{phot} = 10.2 \\pm 0.2$ (95% confidence) with no significant likelihood below $z<9.8$. Based on spectral energy distribution fitting to the total photometry, we estimate an intrinsic stellar mass of $M_{*} \\sim 2.4 - 5.6 \\times 10^{7} M_{\\odot}$, young mass-weighted age of $\\sim 21 - 79$ Myr, low dust content ($A_V < 0.15$), and a low metallicity of $\\lesssim 1\\%~Z_{\\odot}$. We identify a fainter third counterimage candidate within 2.2 arcsec of the predicted position, lensed to AB mag 28.4 and magnified by $\\mu \\sim 2$, suggesting the fold arc may only show $\\sim 60$% of the galaxy. SPT0615-JD is a unique laboratory to study star clusters observed within a galaxy just 460 Myr after the Big Bang.",

      "abstract": "The impact of supernova feedback on metallicity-gradient evolution in cosmological simulations Dyna Ibrahim, Chiaki Kobayashi 22 pages, 25 figures. Accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Tracing the cosmic path of galaxies requires an understanding of their chemical enrichment and merging histories. One of the most important constraints is the internal structure of galaxies, notably the internal distribution of elements acting as fossils in extra-galactic archaeology. Using our cosmological chemodynamical simulations, which include all relevant physical processes and the latest nucleosynthesis yields, we investigate the evolution of radial metallicity gradients of stellar populations and the interstellar medium within each galaxy. This work explores the role of supernova feedback on the metallicity gradients by comparing three feedback models, ejecting energy in thermal, stochastic and mechanical forms. At $z=0$, the mechanical feedback model produces the gradient--mass relations of stars and gas both in excellent agreement with observations; gradients are the steepest at intermediate-mass ($M_*\\sim10^{10}M_\\odot$) and become flatter in massive galaxies probably by major mergers. For each model, we predict similar gradient--mass relations up to $z=4$ and find that the mechanical feedback model gives flatter gradients of both stars and gas for lower-mass galaxies ($M_*<10^{10}M_\\odot$) possibly due to the suppression of star formation and metal ejection by stellar feedback. With all feedback models, most galaxies have negative gas-phase metallicity gradients up to $z=5$, suggesting an inside-out growth, which is consistent with other cosmological simulations but not with recent observations at $z\\sim1$--2.5. We find a mild redshift evolution of gradients up to $z=4$, while there seems to be an evolutionary transition at $z=5$ where the metallicity gradients become steep for gas and stars. These should be investigated with higher-resolution simulations and observations.",

Dust polarisation modelling for isolated starless cores Le Ngoc Tram, Thiem Hoang, Alex Lazarian, Daniel Seifried, B-G Andersson, Thushara G.S. Pillai, Bao Truong, Pham Ngoc Diep, Lapo Fanciullo 16 pages, 12 figures, 1 table, accepted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The polarisation of light induced by aligned interstellar dust serves as a significant tool in investigating cosmic magnetic fields, dust properties, and poses a challenge in characterising the polarisation of the cosmic microwave background and other sources. To establish dust polarisation as a reliable tool, the physics of the grain alignment process needs to be studied thoroughly. The Magnetically enhanced Radiative Torque (MRAT) alignment is the only mechanism that can induce highly efficient alignment of grains with magnetic fields required by polarisation observations of the diffuse interstellar medium. Our numerical modelling of dust polarisation using the MRAT theory demonstrated that the alignment efficiency of starlight polarisation ($p_{\\rm ext}/A_{\\rm V}$) and the degree of thermal dust polarisation ($p_{\\rm em}$) first decrease slowly with increasing visual extinction ($A_{\\rm V}$) and then falls steeply as $\\propto A^{-1}_{\\rm V}$ at large $A_{\\rm V}$ due to the loss of grain alignment, which explains the phenomenon known as polarisation holes. Visual extinction at the transition from shallow to steep slope ($A^{\\rm loss}_{\\rm V}$) increases with the maximum grain size. By applying physical profiles suitable for a starless core 109 in the Pipe Nebula (Pipe-109), our model successfully reproduces the existing observations of starlight polarisation at R-band ($0.65\\,\\mu$m) and H-band ($1.65\\,\\mu$m), as well as emission polarisation at submillimetre ($870\\,\\mu$m). Successful modelling of observational data requires perfect alignment of large grains as evidence of the MRAT mechanism, and larger maximum size with higher elongation at higher $A_{\\rm V}$. The latter reveals the first evidence for the new model of anisotropic grain growth induced by magnetic grain alignment.",

Navarro 21 pages, 23 figures, updated to match accepted version Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We study the response of mono-energetic stellar populations with initially isotropic kinematics to impulsive and adiabatic changes to an underlying dark matter potential. Half-light radii expand and velocity dispersions decrease as enclosed dark matter is removed. The details of this expansion and cooling depend on the time scale on which the underlying potential changes. In the adiabatic regime, the product of half-light radius and average velocity dispersion is conserved. We show that the stellar populations maintain centrally isotropic kinematics throughout their adiabatic evolution, and their densities can be approximated by a family of analytical radial profiles. Metallicity gradients within the galaxy flatten as dark matter is slowly removed. In the case of strong impulsive perturbations, stellar populations develop power-law-like density tails with radially biased kinematics. We show that the distribution of stellar binding energies within the dark matter halo substantially widens after an impulsive perturbation, no matter the sign of the perturbation. This allows initially energetically separated stellar populations to mix, to the extent that previously chemo-dynamically distinct populations may masquerade as a single population with large metallicity and energy spread. Finally, we show that in response to an impulsive perturbation, stellar populations that are deeply embedded in cored dark matter halos undergo a series of damped oscillations before reaching a virialised equilibrium state, driven by inefficient phase mixing in the harmonic potentials of cored halos. This slow return to equilibrium adds substantial systematic uncertainty to dynamical masses estimated from Jeans modeling or the virial theorem.",

We analyse a suite of stratified box simulations modelling a realistic ISM that aims to probe environments similar to those found in the Milky Way. Turbulence is injected through stellar feedback and an external large-scale driving force. We find that star formation can be either boosted or reduced when increasing the external driving strength, depending on the environment. When the density is sufficiently high, warm neutral gas naturally transitions to the cold phase, leading to high cold neutral medium (CNM) fractions of around 40\\%. Under these conditions, excessive large-scale driving leads to a slight reduction of the CNM fraction and an increase in the amount of gas that is thermally unstable. What limits the star formation in this regime is a reduced fraction of dense gas due to additional turbulent support against collapse. For low density regions, overdensities in which cooling is efficient are much rarer and we find that star formation is regulated by the formation of cold gas. In such cases, turbulence can significantly boost star formation by compressing gas in shocks and increasing the CNM fraction dramatically. In our simulations we see an increase from almost no CNM to up to a fraction of 15 \\% when including external turbulence driving; leading to an associated increase in the star formation rate. We provide a model to quantify this behaviour and predict the CNM fraction by combining the standard ISM cooling/heating model with the density PDF generated by turbulence. The change in the dominant limiting process for star formation between low- and intermediate-density environments provides a natural explanation for the observed break in the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation around column densities of 9\\,\\Msun\\, pc$^{-2}$.",

PIE has imaged 37 independent fields in three filters (F336W, F625W and F814W), of which 18 are observed with a fourth band (F475W) from the accompanying PIE+ program. We use photometric colors to select candidate Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at 3.1$<$ z $<$3.5, which can be followed up using ground-based spectrographs to confirm their redshifts. Unlike previous surveys, we use many independent fields to remove biases caused by correlated absorption in the IGM. In this paper, we describe the survey design, photometric measurements, and the use of mock galaxy samples to optimize our color selection. With 3 filters, we can select a galaxy sample of which $\\approx$90\\% are LBGs and over 30\\% lie in the 3.1$<$ z $<$3.5 range for which we can detect uncontaminated LyC emission in F336W. We also use mock IGM sightlines to measure the expected transmission of the IGM, which will allow us to determine escape fractions from our stacked galaxies. We color-select $\\approx$1400 galaxies, and predict that this includes $\\approx$80 LyC-emitting galaxies and $\\approx$500 that we can use in stacking. Finally, we present the Keck/LRIS spectrum of a galaxy at z $\\approx$ 2.99, demonstrating that we can confirm the redshifts of z $\\sim$ 3 galaxies from the ground.",

Published in ApJS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present the first comprehensive catalogs of $^{13}$CO clumps from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) project. By developing an equivalent global detection scheme integrated with the FacetClumps algorithm, we successfully extract 71,661 molecular clumps across a high-resolution $^{13}$CO data cube spanning 2310 deg$^2$ from the MWISP Phase I survey. To determine accurate distances, we design an automatic hierarchical distance decision method using signal regions as fundamental objects, effectively resolving the kinematic distance ambiguity problem and obtaining reliable measurements for 97.94% of the sample. Statistical analysis reveals that 65.3% of clumps are gravitationally bound, accounting for approximately 96.3% of the statistical total mass. Scaling relation analysis across multiple surveys reveals universal power-law behaviors in clump populations. Maser-associated clumps exhibit modified parameter distributions and scaling relations, revealing how active star formation alters clump dynamics and structure. These extensive catalogs establish a foundation for investigating molecular clump properties, star formation processes, and Galactic evolution.",

Two leading explanations for the existence of the double RC concern possible differences in chemical composition (multiple populations of stars) or distance (X-shaped bulge). We aim to verify the chemical composition hypothesis by determining the mean metallicity of each RC. We use infrared photometric data and metallicities from a previous study (that are based on the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System spectra). In contrast with previous studies, we assign stars to RCs or the red giant branch using a Bayesian approach. Our resulting difference between mean metallicity of the two RCs equals: $0.23^{+0.19}_{-0.24}$ or $0.28^{+0.17}_{-0.18}~\\mathrm{dex}$, if the red giant branch bump is included or not, respectively.

Scott Gaudi 22 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Though free-floating planets (FFPs) may outpopulate their bound counterparts in the terrestrial-mass range, they remain one of the least explored exoplanet demographics. Due to their negligible electromagnetic emission at all wavelengths, the only observational technique able to detect these worlds is gravitational microlensing. Microlensing by terrestrial-mass FFPs induces rare, short-duration magnifications of background stars, requiring high-cadence, wide-field surveys to detect these events. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), though designed to detect close-bound exoplanets via transits, boasts a Full-Frame Image cadence as short as 200 seconds and has monitored hundreds of millions of stars, providing a unique dataset in which to search for rare short-duration transients. We have performed a preliminary search for FFP microlensing in 7.5 million light curves from TESS Sectors 61 - 65. We find one short-duration event with a light curve morphology consistent with expectations for a low-mass FFP, but in tension with the expected FFP abundance in this mass range. We consider possible false positive interpretations of this event such as stellar flares, hearbeat binaries, and centrifugal breakout. We find that all interpretations pose some challenges, and discuss the possibility that the event may constitute a first example of a new class of pernicious false positives that future space-based microlensing efforts will encounter. Our ongoing search through the TESS dataset will significantly support the upcoming hunt for rogue worlds with dedicated space-based microlensing surveys, and our results may be used alongside these surveys to place interesting constraints on the spatial distribution of FFPs in the Galaxy.",

We bridge this gap by mining a large sample of massive CB candidates from the OGLE-IV database, increasing their known numbers in the Magellanic Clouds by nearly an order of magnitude. Using main-sequence colour-magnitude limits, an observationally informed period-luminosity-colour relation for CBs, and a high morph-parameter cut ($c\\geq0.7$), we identified 68 O- and B-type binaries that exhibit smooth, sinusoidal light curves with nearly equal eclipse depths. We then isolated a bona fide sample of 37 CB candidates (28 in the LMC and 9 in the SMC) that match theoretical colour-magnitude and period distributions derived from an extensive grid of MESA binary models. The bona fide sample, dominated by B-type systems with $P\\approx0.6-1$ d, agrees with the predicted population and may contain many $q\\approx1$ binaries, as expected from models showing mass equalization preceding temperature equalization during nuclear-timescale contact. Synthetic PHOEBE light curves of contact and near-contact phases of MESA models reveal a degeneracy between these configurations, suggesting possible misidentifications among these systems. Spectroscopic follow-up is required to test these predictions and refine the evolutionary framework of massive CBs.",

Cheyanne Shariat, Kareem El-Badry, Soumyadeep Bhattacharjee Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Precise stellar ages are fundamental to Galactic archaeology. However, obtaining reliable age estimates and uncertainties for field stars has been a long-standing challenge. We test the fidelity of ages from recent catalogs of giants and subgiants using wide binaries, whose components formed at the same time and thus should have consistent inferred ages. We find that subgiant ages based on spectroscopic metallicities from Xiang & Rix (2022) are generally consistent within their reported uncertainties, implying that fractional uncertainties of 5-10% are realistically achievable. In contrast, we find that published photometric subgiant ages underestimate true uncertainties by factors of 2-3. Spectroscopic age estimates for red giant and red clump stars also show reliable uncertainties, but are generally less precise (25-30%). These results demonstrate that accurate metallicity and $\\alpha$-element abundances are essential for precise subgiant ages and establish wide binaries as a powerful, model-independent benchmark for calibrating stellar age measurements in the era of large spectroscopic surveys.",

Dhillon, Stuart Littlefair Accepted for publication in ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present time-series photometry of 31 massive DA white dwarfs with $M\\gtrsim 0.9~M_\\odot$ within the ZZ Ceti instability strip from the Montreal White Dwarf Database 100 pc sample. The majority of the targets had no previous time-series photometry available, though several were classified as non-variable or potential pulsators in the literature. Out of the 31 candidates, we confirm 16 as pulsating. Our observations at three observatories have led us to discover the most massive pulsating white dwarf currently known, J0959$-$1828 ($M=1.32$ or $1.27~M_\\odot$ for a CO versus ONe core), which is slightly more massive than the previous record holder J0049$-$2525. We study the sample properties of massive ZZ Ceti white dwarfs, and find several trends with their weighted mean periods. As predicted by theory, we see an increase in the weighted mean periods with decreasing effective temperature, and a decrease in pulsation amplitudes at the red edge of the instability strip. Furthermore, the weighted mean periods decrease with increasing stellar mass. Our observations show that the ZZ Ceti instability strip may not be pure at high masses. This is likely because the non-variable white dwarfs in the middle of the strip may be weakly magnetic, which could escape detection in the available low-resolution spectroscopy data, but may be sufficient to suppress pulsations. Extensive follow-up observations of the most massive white dwarfs in our sample have the potential to probe the interior structures and core-compositions of these white dwarfs with significantly crystallized cores.",

Schad, Ian Cunnyngham, Yannik Glaser, Linnea Wolniewicz 37 pages, 27 figures, accepted for publication on ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Inferring the three-dimensional (3D) solar atmospheric structures from observations is a critical task for advancing our understanding of the magnetic fields and electric currents that drive solar activity. In this work, we introduce a novel, Physics-Informed Machine Learning method to reconstruct the 3D structure of the lower solar atmosphere based on the output of optical depth sampled spectropolarimetric inversions, wherein both the fully disambiguated vector magnetic fields and the geometric height associated with each optical depth are returned simultaneously. Traditional techniques typically resolve the 180-degree azimuthal ambiguity assuming a single layer, either ignoring the intrinsic non-planar physical geometry of constant optical-depth surfaces (e.g., the Wilson depression in sunspots), or correcting the effect as a post-processing step. In contrast, our approach simultaneously maps the optical depths to physical heights, and enforces the divergence-free condition for magnetic fields fully in 3D. Tests on magnetohydrodynamic simulations of quiet Sun, plage, and a sunspot demonstrate that our method reliably recovers the horizontal magnetic field orientation in locations with appreciable magnetic field strength. By coupling the resolutions of the azimuthal ambiguity and the geometric heights problems, we achieve a self-consistent reconstruction of the 3D vector magnetic fields and, by extension, the electric current density and Lorentz force. This physics-constrained, label-free training paradigm is a generalizable, physics-anchored framework that extends across solar magnetic environments while improving the understanding of various solar puzzles.",

The high-resolution X-ray spectra show that the target is similar to other objects of this class. Data are interpreted under the assumption that the X-rays come from an accreting white dwarf, and our analysis implies an accretion rate of about $3\\times10^{-11}M_\\odot\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Emission lines are weak, and predominantly from hydrogen-like ions: Mg XII, Si XIV, and S XVI. H-like and He-like Fe are both present, but Fe K$\\alpha$ fluorescence is weak, being significantly detected only in the NuSTAR spectrum, but was not obviously detected in the HETG dispersed or zeroth-order spectra. The flux was variable above a level expected by Poisson statistics. There were no significant changes in the spectral hardness, though we are limited by lack of soft signal below 1 keV. Emission lines of Mg and Si were strong enough to measure velocity offsets and widths which were found to be marginally inconsistent. The H-like Mg line is consistent with instrumental broadening only, but shows a 300 km/s blueshift. He-like Mg and H-like Si lines have no significant shift in velocity but are broadened by about 1000 km/s. This suggests either different physical origins or velocity structure differing with plasma temperature.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) How planetary systems form and evolve is a key question in astronomy. Revealing how host star properties, such as elemental abundances, age, and mass, differ from those of non-host stars, and how they correlate with planetary characteristics such as radius, provides new insights into the formation and evolutionary pathways of planetary systems. We determine precise ages for 18890 dwarfs and subgiants from the LAMOST-Kepler-Gaia sample with a mean age uncertainty of about 15 percent (median about 10 percent). Within the framework of Galactic chemical evolution, we find that about 86 percent of planet-hosting stars younger than 8 Gyr occupy the upper branch ([Fe/H] > -0.2) of the characteristic V-shaped age-metallicity relation of the Galactic disk. Based on guiding radii (Rg), we further infer that about 19 percent of these young hosts likely originated in the inner disk and subsequently migrated to the solar neighborhood. Among stars older than 10 Gyr, host stars tend to be more metal-rich, with nearly 59 percent having [Fe/H] > -0.2. This suggests that both young and old planet-hosting stars preferentially form in relatively metal-rich environments. However, for host stars with [Fe/H] < -0.2, we find that their metallicities are on average lower by about 0.16 dex compared to non-host stars of similar age and mass, indicating that [Fe/H] is unlikely to be the dominant factor governing planet formation in metal-poor environments. We also identify a systematic depletion of volatile elements, especially carbon, in planet hosts. Moreover, host star [Fe/H] exhibits a weak correlation with planet radius, while [alpha/Fe] primarily support the formation of small planets.",

Whittlesey Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) We analyze \\textit{Parker Solar Probe} and \\textit{Solar Orbiter} observations to investigate the propagation and dissipation of Alfvénic fluctuations from the outer corona to 1~AU. Conservation of wave-action flux provides the theoretical baseline for how fluctuation amplitudes scale with the Alfvén Mach number $M_a$, once solar-wind acceleration is accounted for. Departures from this scaling quantify the net balance between energy injection and dissipation. Fluctuation amplitudes follow wave-action conservation for $M_a < M_a^{b}$ but steepen beyond this break point, which typically lies near the Alfvén surface ($M_a \\approx 1$) yet varies systematically with normalized cross helicity $\\sigma_c$ and fluctuation scale. In slow, quasi-balanced streams, the transition occurs at $M_a \\lesssim 1$; in fast, imbalanced wind, WKB-like scaling persists to $M_a \\gtrsim 1$. Outer-scale fluctuations maintain wave-action conservation to larger $M_a$ than inertial-range modes. The turbulent heating rate $Q$ is largest below $M_a^{b}$, indicating a preferential heating zone shaped by the degree of imbalance. Despite this, the Alfvénic energy flux $F_a$ remains elevated, and the corresponding damping length $\\Lambda_d = F_a/Q$ remains sufficiently large to permit long-range propagation before appreciable damping occurs. Normalized damping lengths $\\Lambda_d/H_A$, where $H_A$ is the inverse Alfvén-speed scale height, are near unity for $M_a \\lesssim M_a^{b}$ but decline with increasing $M_a$ and decreasing $U$, implying that incompressible reflection-driven turbulence alone cannot account for the observed dissipation. Additional damping mechanisms -- such as compressible effects -- are likely required to account for the observed heating rates across much of the parameter space.",

Multi-wavelength, multi-method research is playing an increasingly crucial role. Binaries account for a substantial fraction of all stellar systems and research into binaries is of fundamental importance. LAMOST J064137.77+045743.8 has not yet been recorded in the SIMBAD astronomical database. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of LAMOST J064137.77+045743.8 using multi-band spectroscopic, astrometric, and photometric data. The low-resolution spectra from Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) suggest that LAMOST J064137.77+045743.8 is a binary consisting of an A7-type subgiant star ($T_{\\rm eff}$ $\\sim$ 7500\\,K and log\\,$g$ $\\sim$ 3.9) and a cool red dwarf star. Astrometric data from Globe Astrometric Interferometers for Astrophysics support the binary speculation with a Renormalized Unit Weight Error metric value of 1.9. Additional flux observations in the infrared bands further corroborate the presence of a red dwarf companion. The i-band flare detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) photometric observations bolsters the interpretation of an M-type red dwarf companion. The radial velocity variations in the H$\\alpha$ lines from LAMOST medium-resolution spectra and the light curves from ZTF both support the classification of the A7 subgiant as a pulsating star. The binary either has a long orbital period, a non-eclipsing binary orbit, or extremely shallow eclipses. Future asteroseismology studies will further probe the internal physics of the A7 subgiants. Research on binaries is incredibly fascinating.",

Stegen 13 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics (A&A) Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) X-ray observations of the Sun led Eugene Parker to propose nanoflares as the basic energy-release units that heat the solar corona. Decades later, Solar Orbiter's Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (HRIEUV), operating halfway between Earth and the Sun, revealed thousands of even smaller brightenings in the quiet corona - tiny \"campfires\" that are smaller and far more frequent than the fundamental nanoflares observed from 1 AU. We analyze over 12,000 of these events, deriving their thermal energies using multiple geometric models to account for volume uncertainties. Although absolute values vary, all models yield consistent power-law energy distributions and ranges, confirming their flare-like behavior. These picoflares, spanning 10^20-10^24 erg, were detected exactly between the Sun and Earth. They occur up to sixty times more often than nanoflares seen from Earth orbit and supply about 1% of the quiet-Sun coronal heating power. This previously unseen energy source may be a missing component in the solar energy balance. Their discovery extends the flare energy spectrum to smaller scales, and future Solar Orbiter observations at 0.28 AU may reveal the most fundamental flare events that sustain the million-degree solar corona.",

Stapelfeldt, Ryo Tazaki, Jennifer B. Bergner, Emmanuel Dartois, Jennifer A. Noble, William Thompson Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The James Webb Space Telescope provides unprecedented information to study ices in protoplanetary disks. However, the saturation of ice bands in highly inclined disks hinders the measurement of ice abundances using classical spectroscopy. This is unfortunate as the presence and more importantly abundance of ices plays a key role in, e.g., the evolution of dust (because it modifies the sticking properties) and the composition of planetesimals and exoplanetary atmospheres. To overcome this issue and quantify the ice abundance within disks, we introduce a new method based on measuring the changes in the apparent disk thickness as a function of wavelength, which is directly and quantitatively related to the grain opacity. Specifically, we expect i) that the increased opacity within ice bands should result in a thicker disk than in the adjacent continuum, and ii) the thickness variations to be proportional to the abundance of ice. We extracted the disk thickness in model images of edge-on disks containing different abundances of water ice, as well as in James Webb Space Telescope spectral imaging of four edge-on disks. For both models and observations, the disk thickness decreases toward longer wavelengths except across the positions of ice absorption features where the thickness is enhanced across the band. In the model images, we demonstrate that this effect increases with ice abundance without any hint of saturation. This definitely demonstrates the presence of the ice species within each disk and confirms our expectation that this method can be applied to estimate ice abundances. Thanks to this method, it will thus be possible to constrain the ice abundance in highly inclined disks with disks model fitting. Unlike spectroscopic analysis, this method is not subject to saturation and should therefore be more robust and applicable to all disks for which the two surfaces can be resolved.",

Statistical analysis of 100 jets (50 inside jets and 50 outside jets) reveals that inside jets have a projected velocity range of 4--14~km\\,s$^{-1}$, a length range of 1--4~Mm, a width range of 0.2--0.6~Mm, and a lifetime range of 135--450~s, with mean values of 7.90~km\\,s$^{-1}$, 2.61~Mm, 0.41~Mm, and 260~s, respectively. About 52\\% of inside jets are associated with brightenings in H$\\alpha$ blue wing images, and some show high-temperature signatures, suggesting a connection with localized energy release. In contrast, outside jets have higher velocities (8--50~km\\,s$^{-1}$, average 19.04~km\\,s$^{-1}$), greater lengths (average 6.26~Mm, up to 27.27~Mm), slightly larger widths (average 0.46~Mm), and longer lifetimes (135--630~s, average 327~s). They typically originate from regions of opposite magnetic polarities and are associated with magnetic flux emergence and EUV brightenings. Some outside jets correspond to coronal jets with inverted Y-shaped structures and temperatures exceeding one million Kelvin. Our results suggest that both jet types are driven by magnetic reconnection occurring in distinct magnetic field configurations and contribute to chromospheric and coronal heating.",

Buldgen, C. Guillaume, A. L. Stokholm, D. Huber, J. L. Rørsted, P. Mani, F. Grundahl Accepted for publication in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) HD 140283 is a well-studied metal-poor subgiant and a Gaia benchmark star, often used for testing stellar models due to its proximity, brightness, and low metallicity ([Fe/H] = -2.3 dex). Here we present the first asteroseismic analysis of HD 140283, providing improved constraints on its fundamental properties. The star was observed by TESS in 20-second cadence during Sector 51. We extracted a custom light curve and performed a frequency analysis, revealing a rich spectrum of solar-like oscillations including mixed modes. These were combined with parameters from the literature to provide constraints on our model inference performed with BASTA. Using a dense grid of models, we find a mass of $0.75 \\pm 0.01 \\ \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$, a radius of $2.078 \\substack{+0.012\\\\-0.011} \\ \\mathrm{R}_\\odot$, and an age of $14.2 \\pm 0.4$ Gyr, in agreement with the upper limit set by the age of the Universe within $1\\sigma$. The observed frequency of maximum power, $\\left(\\nu_\\mathrm{max}\\right)_\\mathrm{obs} = 611.3 \\pm 7.4 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{Hz}$, is significantly higher than predicted from standard scaling relations ($\\left(\\nu_\\mathrm{max}\\right)_\\mathrm{mod} = 537.2 \\substack{+2.9\\\\-1.8} \\ \\mu\\mathrm{Hz}$), extending known deviations into the metal-poor regime. To our knowledge, the oscillations in HD 140283 have the highest $\\nu_\\mathrm{max}$ of any metal-poor star to date, which will help to advance our understanding of oscillations in metal-poor stars in general. The results demonstrate the value of asteroseismology for precise age determination in old halo stars and taking custom abundances and opacities into account during the modelling is probably important for further improving models of such stars. In addition, a detailed characterisation of metal-poor stars, such as HD 140283, will also help advance our understanding of Population III stars and their impact on future stellar generations.",

Accepted for publication in AJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We report the identification and characterization of a new binary system composed of two near-equal mass M-dwarfs. The binary NGTS-EB-8 was identified as a planet candidate in data from the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) by citizen scientists participating in the Planet Hunters NGTS project. High-resolution spectroscopic observations reveal the system to be a double-lined binary. By modeling the photometric and radial velocity observations, we determine an orbital period of 4.2 days and the masses and radii of both stars to be $M_A=0.250^{+0.005}_{-0.004}$ M$_{\\odot}$, $M_B=0.208^{+0.005}_{-0.004}$ M$_{\\odot}$, $R_A=0.255^{+0.004}_{-0.005}$ R$_{\\odot}$, $R_B=0.233^{+0.006}_{-0.005}$ R$_{\\odot}$. We detect Balmer line emission from at least one of the stars but no significant flare activity. We note that both components lie in the fully convective regime of low-mass stars ($<0.35$ M$_{\\odot}$), therefore can be a valuable test for stellar evolutionary models. We demonstrate that the photometric observations, speckle imaging and initial radial velocity measurements were unable to identify the true nature of this system and highlight that high-resolution spectroscopic observations are crucial in determining whether systems such as this are in fact binaries.",

      "abstract": "Precise boron abundance in a sample of metal-poor stars from far-ultraviolet lines Monique Spite, Beatriz Barbuy, Kefeng Tan Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The light elements beryllium (Be; $Z=4$) and boron (B; $Z=5$) are mainly produced by spallation reactions between cosmic rays and carbon (C; $Z=6$), nitrogen (N; $Z=7$), and oxygen (O; $Z=8$) nuclei. Only traces of Be or B would have been produced in the Big Bang, but there could be a contribution from the $\\nu$-process in type II supernovae. Their abundances at very low metallicities have been debated in the literature, with the aim of understanding their origin. Our aim is to derive the boron abundance in a sample of metal-poor stars based for the first time on observations with the STIS spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope, using clean B lines measured in space ultraviolet. We identified a measurable line of B I at 2089.6 A. In our sample of metal-poor warm stars, this line is practically free from blending lines, and for this reason the precision of the presently derived boron abundances is unprecedented. We find that in the interval -2.6<[Fe/H]<-1.0, the slope of the relation A(B) versus [Fe/H] is significantly larger than 1, and thus steeper than that obtained with Be abundances. As a consequence, we find in this interval of metallicity a B/Be ratio that slightly increases with [Fe/H]. Since at [Fe/H]=-1 the abundance of B is already close to the solar abundance, there should be a break in the B enrichment at a metallicity of about [Fe/H]=-1.",

While surveys of planet forming material have found diminished disk masses around medium separation ($\\sim$10--100 au) binaries, less is known about tight ($<$10 au) binaries, where a significant circumbinary disk may escape the disruptive dynamical effects of the binary. We survey over 100 spectroscopic binaries in the Orion A region with ALMA, detecting significant continuum emission among 21 of them with disk masses ranging from 1--100 M$_{\\oplus}$. We find evidence of systematically lower disk masses among the binary sample when compared to single star surveys, which may reflect a diminished planet forming potential around tight binaries. The infrared excess fraction among the binary sample is comparable to single stars, although the tight binaries without significant ALMA emission display tentative evidence of weaker 3-5$\\mu$m excesses. The depletion of cold dust is difficult to explain by clearing alone, and the role of additional mechanisms needs to be explored. It may be the result of the formation pathway for these objects, systematic differences in intrinsic properties (e.g., opacity) or a bias in how the sample was constructed.",

Turner, Alan Didion, Jaime Nastal, David Makowski 16 pages, 8 figures, accepted to ApJ Letters Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present the TESS discovery of only the second system of transiting exocomets with a sufficient number of events to measure the size distribution in the RZ Psc system, enabling comparisons with the $\\beta$ Pictoris and Solar System size distributions. Twenty-four transits with absorption depths (AD) of 1--20\\% were observed across three TESS sectors of the 20-50 Myr K0V star, detected as part of our TESS survey of extreme debris disks identified by their IR excess. We discover that the ADs (and hence exocomet radii) follow a broken power-law cumulative frequency distribution not previously seen in extrasolar contexts but similar to that observed in Solar System Kuiper Belt Object sizes, with power-law slopes above and below the break of $\\gamma_\\mathrm{AD>break}$=2.32$\\pm$0.12 and $\\gamma_\\mathrm{AD<break}$=0.11$\\pm$0.04, respectively. We derive size distributions of 1--7~km from two independent lines of evidence. We use the RZ Psc exocomet rate to predict exocomet yields for the Early eVolution Explorer (EVE) NASA astrophysics Small Explorer (SMEX) mission concept to obtain simultaneous photometry of 10$^4$ young stars in NUV, optical, and NIR bands. Assuming occurrence rates scaled from RZ Psc, EVE would detect 590 exocomets from $\\approx$70 young systems in the optical band, with $\\approx$120 simultaneous 5$\\sigma$ detections in all three bands. These data would enable grain sizes of 200--700~nm and graphite--olivine compositions of dozens of events to be distinguished at 2.5--3$\\sigma$, as well as a 4$\\sigma$ determination of the accuracy of the Herschel-derived M-debris disk fraction.",

Zingales 13 pages, 12 figures, submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Sub-Neptunes with planetary radii of $R_{p} \\simeq 2-4 R_{\\oplus}$ are the most common planets around solar-type stars in short-period ($P<100$ d) orbits. It is still unclear, however, what their most likely composition is, that is whether they are predominantly gas dwarfs or water worlds. The sub-Neptunes orbiting bright host stars are very valuable because they are suitable for atmospheric characterization, which can break the well-known degeneracy in planet composition from the planet bulk density, when combined with a precise and accurate mass measurement. Here we report on the characterization of the sub-Neptune TOI-5789 c, which transits in front of the bright ($V=7.3$ mag and $K_{s}=5.35$ mag) and magnetically inactive K1V dwarf HIP 99452 every 12.93 days, thanks to TESS photometry and 141 high-precision radial velocities obtained with the HARPS-N spectrograph. We find that its radius, mass, and bulk density are $R_{c}=2.86^{+0.18}_{-0.15} R_\\oplus$, $M_{c}=5.00 \\pm 0.50 M_\\oplus$, and $\\rho_{c}=1.16 \\pm 0.23$ g cm$^{-3}$, and we show that TOI-5789 c is a promising target for atmospheric characterization with both JWST and, in the future, Ariel. By analyzing the HARPS-N radial velocities with different tools, we also detect three additional non-transiting planets, namely TOI-5789 b, d, and e, with orbital periods and minimum masses of $P_{b}=2.76$ d, $M_{b}\\sin{i}=2.12 \\pm 0.28 M_\\oplus$, $P_{d}=29.6$ d, $M_{d}\\sin{i}=4.29 \\pm 0.68 M_\\oplus$, and $P_{e}=63.0$ d, $M_{e}\\sin{i}=11.61 \\pm 0.97 M_\\oplus$. The mutual orbital inclination between planets b and c must be higher than $\\sim4$ deg, which points to a dynamically hot system. Nevertheless, from sensitivity studies based on both the HARPS-N and archival HIRES radial-velocity measurements, we can exclude that such high mutual inclinations are due to the perturbation by an outer gaseous giant planet.",

Ould-Elhkim Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) One of the first exoplanet hosts discovered thirty years ago, the star 55 Cnc has been constantly observed ever since. It is now known to host at least five planets with orbital periods ranging from 17 hours to 15 years. It is also one of the most extreme metal rich stars in the neighbourhood and it has a low-mass secondary star. In this article, we present data obtained at the Canada-France-Hawai'i Telescope with the SPIRou spectropolarimeter on both components of the 55 Cnc stellar system. We revisit the long-period radial-velocity signals of 55 Cnc A, with a focus on the role of the magnetic cycle, and propose the existence of a sixth planet candidate, whose period falls close to that of the magnetic cycle, or half of it. The other massive outer planet has a revised period of 13.15 years and a minimum mass of 3.8 MJup. Although some uncertainty remains on these outer planets, the characterization of the four inner planets is very robust through the combination of many different data sets, and all signals are consistent in the nIR and optical domains. In addition, the magnetic topology of the solar-type primary component of the system is observed by SPIRou at the minimum of its activity cycle, characterized by an amplitude ten times smaller than observed during its maximum in 2017. For the low-mass component 55 Cnc B, we report the discovery of two exoplanets in the system, with a period of 6.799+-0.0014 and 33.75+-0.04 days and a minimum mass of 3.5+-0.8 and 5.3+-1.4 MEarth, respectively. The secondary magnetic field is very weak and the current data set does not allow its precise characterization, setting an upper limit of 10 G. The system 55 Cnc stands out as the sixth binary system with planetary systems around both components, and the first one with non equal-mass stellar components.",

Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) will provide high-resolution, multi-line spectropolarimetric observations that are poised to revolutionize our understanding of the Sun. Given the massive data volume, novel inference techniques are required to unlock its full potential. Here, we provide an overview of our \"SPIn4D\" project, which aims to develop deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for estimating the physical properties of the solar photosphere from DKIST spectropolarimetric observations. We describe the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling and the Stokes profile synthesis pipeline that produce the simulated output and input data, respectively. These data will be used to train a set of CNNs that can rapidly infer the four-dimensional MHD state vectors by exploiting the spatiotemporally coherent patterns in the Stokes profile time series. Specifically, our radiative MHD model simulates the small-scale dynamo actions that are prevalent in quiet-Sun and plage regions. Six cases with different mean magnetic fields have been conducted; each case covers six solar-hours, totaling 109 TB in data volume. The simulation domain covers at least $25\\times25\\times8$ Mm with $16\\times16\\times12$ km spatial resolution, extending from the upper convection zone up to the temperature minimum region. The outputs are stored at a 40 s cadence. We forward model the Stokes profile of two sets of Fe I lines at 630 and 1565 nm, which will be simultaneously observed by DKIST and can better constrain the parameter variations along the line of sight. The MHD model output and the synthetic Stokes profiles are publicly available, with 13.7 TB in the initial release.",

One way to detect the presence of non-thermal protons during flares is through the Orrall-Zirker (OZ) effect, proposed by Orrall & Zirker (1976), whereby an enhanced red wing appears in hydrogen emission lines (e.g., Lyman-$\\alpha$ at 1215.67 angstroms). We analyze archival Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph G130M (1060 - 1360 angstroms) observations of the young M dwarf, AU Mic to search for evidence of OZ effect during the impulsive phase of six stellar flares with $E_\\textrm{flare} \\approx 10^{30 - 31}$ erg. While we found non-detections of the OZ effect, we note there is a pronounced blue enhancement in several C II and C III emission lines during one of the high-energy flares. We propose that either filament eruptions or chromospheric evaporation could be the mechanism driving this observed blue enhancement. We compare the far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra to 1D radiative-hydrodynamic stellar flare models, which are unable to reproduce the blue enhancement and broadening in these cool flare lines. By completing a line-by-line analysis of the FUV spectrum of AU Mic, we provide further constraints on the physical mechanisms producing stellar flares on M dwarfs.",

Ellwarth Accepted in A&A, 23 pages, 18 figures Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Context. Solar flux atlases observe the spatially integrated light from the Sun, treating it as a star. They are fundamental tools for gaining insight into the composition of the Sun and other stars, and are utilized as reference material for a wide range of solar applications such as stellar chemical abundances, atmospheric physics, stellar activity, and radial velocity signals. Aims. We provide a detailed comparison of solar activity in some of the well-known solar atlases against the new High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) Quiet Sun (QS) and measured activity (MA) atlases that are published, for the first time, in this work. Methods. Ten of the widely used individual spectral lines from each flux atlas were selected to compare solar activity using three methods: 1) Equivalent Widths 2) Activity number, a novel activity measure which we introduce in this work. 3) Bisectors and radial velocity. Results. The significantly smaller activity measured in the MA atlas compared to the other atlases, relative to the QS atlas, underscores the dominance of instrumental effects over solar activity in their impact on spectral lines, which cannot be corrected through simple line convolution to match resolutions of other atlases. Additionally, our investigation unexpectedly revealed a substantial intensity shift in the Ca ii H & K lines of other atlases compared to our HARPS-N atlases, likely caused by assumptions in normalisation techniques used in the early Kitt Peak atlases. Conclusions. With an average spot number of zero, our QS atlas is well suited to serve as an absolute benchmark atlas representative of solar minimum for the visible spectrum that other atlases can be compared against. Our recommendations are 1) publication of a detailed log along with the observations, to include exact dates and indications of solar activity...",

Making such measurements is important both from a space weather perspective and for understanding the detailed evolution of the CME. In spite of significant efforts and multiple proposed methods, achieving this goal has not been possible to date. Here we report the first possible detection of gyroresonance emission from a CME. Assuming that the emission is happening at the third harmonic, we estimate that the magnetic field strength ranges from 7.9--5.6 G between 4.9-7.5 $R_\\odot$. We also demonstrate that this high magnetic field is not the average magnetic field inside the CME, but most probably is related to small magnetic islands, which are also being observed more frequently with the availability of high-resolution and high-quality white-light images.",

Ogilvie 14 pages, 20 figures, accepted for publication in A&A. v2 after language editor and feedback from readers Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) (abridged) Context: The vertical shear instability (VSI) is a promising mechanism to generate turbulence and transport angular momentum in protoplanetary discs. While most recent work has focused on adding more complex physics, the saturation properties of the instability in radially extended discs and its convergence as a function of resolution are still largely unknown. We tackle the question of VSI saturation and associated turbulence using radially extended fully 3D global disc models at very high resolution so as to capture both the largest VSI scales and the small-scale turbulent cascade. We use the GPU-accelerated code Idefix to achieve resolutions of up to 200 points per scale height in the 3 spatial directions, with a full 2pi azimuthal extent and disc aspect ratio H/R=0.1. Results: We demonstrate that large-scale transport properties are converged with 100 points per scale height, leading to a Shakura-Sunyaev alpha=1.3e-3. Inner boundary condition artifacts propagate deep inside the computational domain, leading to reduced alpha in these regions. The large-scale corrugation wave zones identified in 2D models survive in 3D, albeit with less coherence. Our models show no sign of long-lived zonal flows, pressure bumps or vortices, in contrast to lower-resolution simulations. Finally, we show that the turbulent cascade resulting from VSI saturation can be interpreted in the framework of critically balanced rotating turbulence. Conclusion: The VSI leads to vigorous turbulence in protoplanetary discs, associated with outward angular momentum transport but without any significant long-lived features that could enhance planet formation. The innermost regions of VSI simulations are always polluted by boundary-condition artifacts affecting the first VSI wave train, so radially extended domains should be used in a more systematic manner.",

Kennedy, Marijke Haverkorn, Andrea Bracco, John Conway Submitted to Astrophysical Journal Supplement (ApJS) Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Polarized synchrotron emission at meter to centimeter wavelengths provides an effective tracer of the Galactic magnetic field. Calculating Faraday depth, the most useful parameter for mapping the line-of-sight magnetic field, requires observations covering wide frequency bands with many channels. As part of the Global Magneto-Ionic Medium Survey we have observed polarized emission spanning 350-1030 MHz over the Northern sky, in the declination range ${-20^{\\circ}}\\leq{\\delta}\\leq{90^{\\circ}}$. We used the 15 m telescope at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO), equipped to receive orthogonal circular polarizations, with the Onsala Space Observatory band-1 feed developed for the Square Kilometre Array. Angular resolution varies across the band from $1.3^{\\circ}$ to $3.6^{\\circ}$. A digital spectrometer provided 42 kHz frequency resolution. Data were taken with the telescope moving rapidly in azimuth and are absolutely calibrated in intensity. Approximately 20% of the band was obscured by radio-frequency interference. Resolution in Faraday depth is $\\sim6$ rad m$^{-2}$, and features as wide as $\\sim38$ rad m$^{-2}$ are represented. The median sensitivity of the Faraday depth cube is 11 mK. Approximately 55% of sight-lines in this survey show Faraday complexity. This dataset, called ``DRAO GMIMS of the Northern Sky'' (DRAGONS), is the first to probe Faraday depth of the Northern sky in its frequency range and will support many scientific investigations. The data will be used to calibrate surveys with higher angular resolution, particularly Galactic foreground maps from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment, and to provide information on large structures for aperture-synthesis telescopes, particularly the DRAO Synthesis Telescope. The data are available through the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre.",

We report on a table-top optical experiment featuring two alignment sensing schemes: the conventional Wavefront Sensing (WFS) scheme which uses quadrant photodetectors (QPDs) to recover optical alignment, and the newly developed Radio Frequency Jitter Alignment Sensing (RFJAS) scheme, which uses an electro-optic beam deflector (EOBD) to apply fast angular modulation. This work evaluates the performance of RFJAS through a direct, side-by-side comparison with WFS. We present a detailed noise budget for both techniques, with particular emphasis on limitations at low frequencies, below 30\\,Hz. Our results show that WFS performance is constrained by technical noise arising from beam spot motion (BSM), mainly due to beam miscentering on QPDs. In contrast, RFJAS is primarily limited by residual RF amplitude modulation. A blended scheme that combines both sensing methods may offer the most practical approach for use in gravitational wave detectors such as Advanced LIGO.",

Oberg Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph) Aromaticity is a common chemical functionalities in bioactive molecules. In interstellar and circumstellar environments benzene and other small aromatics are considered the precursor for more complex prebiotic molecules and they have shown to potentially have rich ice-phase photochemistry. The availability of small organic molecules in prebiotic networks depends on their photostability in astrophysical environments preceding planet formation, particularly during the protoplanetary disk stage, as the disk composition is linked to the chemical make-up of planets and planetesimals. We study the ultraviolet (UV) photodestruction (120-160 nm) of five aromatic molecules in undiluted ices and, for selected cases, in astrophysically relevant ice matrices (H2O, CO, CO2). For each ice, we measure the destruction cross sections as a function of photon exposure. In undiluted ices, aromatic molecules exhibit substantially lower photodestruction cross sections (sigma < 10-19 cm2) than aliphatic hydrocarbons, including cyclohexane, (sigma = 2.8-4x10-18 cm2). Furthermore, neither substituent nature nor size affects the aromatic stability in pure ices, suggesting that the strong intermolecular interactions among aromatic molecules provide protection against VUV exposure, even with small to mid-sized ring substituents. In mixed ices, the photodestruction and reactivity of aromatic molecules (sigma = 2.5-6.1x10-18 cm2) increases by more than an order of magnitude, but are still lower than in the gas-phase. We attribute this to a weaker cage effect and matrix-specific interactions. We use the experimental photodestruction cross sections to estimate the lifetime of aromatic molecules in protoplanetary disks, denileating the disks regions in which aromatic photochemistry is expected to be the most active.",

However, the performance of AMI (and other high resolution approaches such as kernel phase) in recovery of structure at high contrasts has not met design expectations. A major contributing factor has been the presence of uncorrected detector systematics, notably charge migration effects in the H2RG sensor, and insufficiently accurate mask metrology. Here we present Amigo, a data-driven calibration framework and analysis pipeline that forward-models the full JWST AMI system - including its optics, detector physics, and readout electronics - using an end-to-end differentiable architecture implemented in the Jax framework and in particular exploiting the dLux optical modelling package. Amigo directly models the generation of up-the-ramp detector reads, using an embedded neural sub-module to capture non-linear charge redistribution effects, enabling the optimal extraction of robust observables, for example kernel amplitudes and phases, while mitigating systematics such as the brighter-fatter effect. We demonstrate Amigo's capabilities by recovering the ABDor AC binary from commissioning data with high-precision astrometry, and detecting both HD206893B and the inner substellar companion HD206893c: a benchmark requiring contrasts approaching 10 magnitudes at separations of only 100 mas. These results exceed outcomes from all published pipelines, and re-establish AMI as a viable competitor for imaging at high contrast at the diffraction limit.

However, to search for transient targets such as the fast radio burst (FRB), it is more convenient to use the beam-forming technique, where the real-time voltage outputs of the array elements are used to generate data streams (beams) which are sensitive to a specific direction. This is usually achieved by a weighted sum of the array element voltages, with the complex weight adjusted so that all outputs have the same phase for that direction. Alternatively, beams can also be formed from the weighted sum of the short time averaged correlation (visibility) data. We shall call these two approaches the electric voltage beam forming (EBF) and cross-correlation beam forming (XBF), respectively. All beams formed with the EBF can also be formed by the XBF method, but the latter can also generate beams which can not be generated by the former. We discuss the properties of these two kinds of beams, and the amount of computation required in each case. For an array with large number of elements, the XBF would require much more computation resource, although this is partly compensated by the fact that it allows integration over time. We study the impact of cross-coupling between array elements on the beamforming, first using a toy model, then for the case of the Tianlai Cylinder Pathfinder Array. In both cases, we find that the impact of the cross-coupling on the beam profile is relatively small. The understanding gained in this study is helpful in designing and understanding the beam-forming FRB digital backend for compact arrays such as the Tianlai array.",

Gressel Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph) The stability of a differentially rotating fluid subject to its own gravity is a problem with applications across wide areas of astrophysics--from protoplanetary discs (PPDs) to entire galaxies. The shearing box formalism offers a conceptually simple framework for studying differential rotation in the local approximation. Aimed at self-gravitating, and importantly, vertically stratified PPDs, we develop two novel methods for solving Poisson's equation in the framework of the shearing box with vertical vacuum boundary conditions (BCs). Both approaches naturally make use of multi-dimensional fast Fourier transforms for computational efficiency. While the first one exploits the linearity properties of the Poisson equation, the second, which is slightly more accurate, consists of finding the adequate discrete Green's function (in Fourier space) adapted to the problem at hand. To this end, we have revisited the method proposed by Vico et al. (2016) and have derived an analytical Green's function satisfying the shear-periodic BCs in the plane as well as vacuum BCs, vertically. Our spectral method demonstrates excellent accuracy, even with a modest number of grid points, and exhibits third-order convergence. It has been implemented in the NIRVANA-III code, where it exhibits good scalability up to 4096 CPU cores, consuming less than 6% of the total runtime. This was achieved through the use of P3DFFT, a fast Fourier Transform library that employs pencil decomposition, overcoming the scalability limitations inherent in libraries using slab decomposition. We have introduced two novel spectral Poisson solvers that guarantees high accuracy, performance, and intrinsically support vertical vacuum boundary conditions in the shearing-box framework. Our solvers enable high-resolution local studies involving self-gravity, such as MHD simulations of gravito-turbulence or gravitational fragmentation.",

Each of these events was recorded within one time frame. Conventional methods of energy reconstruction are not applicable in this case because the events do not have light curves but a single data point. As an alternative, we consider a number of approaches based on artificial neural networks. We demonstrate that a signal recorded by a fluorescence telescope within one time frame might be enough to reconstruct the energy of a primary particle with reasonable accuracy using an ensemble of simple convolutional neural networks. Contrary to the conventional approach, reconstruction of the shower geometry is not needed for this. More than this, preliminary estimates can be obtained even without recognizing the shower track. However, there remain some problems that do not allow us to claim that the suggested method is universal and always works. We discuss difficulties that we faced and possible ways of improving the method.",

PASP accepted Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Slitless spectroscopy eliminates the need for slits, allowing light to pass directly through a prism or grism to generate a spectral dispersion image that encompasses all celestial objects within a specified area. This technique enables highly efficient spectral acquisition. However, when processing CSST slitless spectroscopy data, the unique design of its focal plane introduces a challenge: photometric and slitless spectroscopic images do not have a one-to-one correspondence. As a result, it becomes essential to first identify and count the sources in the slitless spectroscopic images before extracting spectra. To address this challenge, we employed the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection algorithm to develop a model for detecting targets in slitless spectroscopy images. This model was trained on 1,560 simulated CSST slitless spectroscopic images. These simulations were generated from the CSST Cycle 6 and Cycle 9 main survey data products, representing the Galactic and nearby galaxy regions and the high galactic latitude regions, respectively. On the validation set, the model achieved a precision of 88.6% and recall of 90.4% for spectral lines, and 87.0% and 80.8% for zeroth-order images. In testing, it maintained a detection rate >80% for targets brighter than 21 mag (medium-density regions) and 20 mag (low-density regions) in the Galactic and nearby galaxies regions, and >70% for targets brighter than 18 mag in high galactic latitude regions.",

However, its performance was found to be limited by non-linear detector systematics, particularly charge migration - or the Brighter-Fatter Effect. Conventional interferometric Fourier observables are degraded by non-linear transformations in the image plane, with the consequence that the inner working angle and contrast limits of AMI were seriously compromised. Building on the end-to-end differentiable model & calibration code amigo, we here present a regularised maximum-likelihood image reconstruction framework dorito which can deconvolve AMI images either in the image plane or from calibrated Fourier observables, achieving high angular resolution and contrast over a wider field of view than conventional interferometric limits. This modular code by default includes regularisation by maximum entropy, and total variation defined with $l_1$ or $l_2$ metrics. We present imaging results from dorito for three benchmark imaging datasets: the volcanoes of Jupiter's moon Io, the colliding-wind binary dust nebula WR 137 and the archetypal Seyfert 2 active galactic nucleus NGC 1068. In all three cases we recover images consistent with the literature at diffraction-limited resolutions. The performance, limitations, and future opportunities enabled by amigo for AMI imaging (and beyond) are discussed.",

Konidaris Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 543, Issue 2, October 2025, Pages 1624 to 1637 Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Atmospheric scintillation is one of the largest sources of error in ground-based spectrophotometry, reducing the precision of astrophysical signals extracted from the time-series of bright objects to that of much fainter objects. Relative to the fundamental Poisson noise, scintillation is not effectively reduced by observing with larger telescopes, and alternative solutions are needed to maximize the spectrophotometric precision of large telescopes. If the chromatic covariance of the scintillation is known, it can be used to reduce the scintillation noise in spectrophotometry. This paper derives analytical solutions for the chromatic covariance of stellar scintillation on a large telescope for a given atmospheric turbulence profile, wind speed, wind direction, and airmass at optical/near-infrared wavelengths. To demonstrate how scintillation noise is isolated, scintillation-limited exoplanet transit spectroscopy is simulated. Then, a procedure is developed to remove scintillation noise and produce Poisson-noise limited light curves. The efficacy and limits of this technique will be tested with on sky observations of a new, high spectrophotometric precision, low resolution spectrograph.",

Open to comments from the community Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Planned and future missions, including the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), will aim to directly image Earth-like exoplanets around Sun-like stars in reflected light. Determining whether an exoplanet is in the habitable zone of its star may be difficult in multi-planet systems when the observer does not know in advance which point source detection corresponds to which planet. This \"confusion\" problem will be a concern for future missions due to the high occurrence rate of multi-planet systems, and will be exacerbated by lack of prior knowledge about planets' orbital parameters or characteristics, particularly for systems at high inclination with respect to the observer. This work addresses the confusion problem by developing a photometry model and new orbit ranking function to augment the \"deconfuser\" tool and account for phase variation exhibited by a planet throughout its orbit. We demonstrate the new ranking scheme on a subset of thirty highly confused simulated multi-planet systems among three inclination groupings (low, medium, and high). Results indicate that photometry improves differentiation of previously confused orbits in 7/10 of the low inclination cases, 6/10 of the medium inclination cases, and 6/10 of the high inclination cases. This improvement in handling highly confused systems emphasizes that photometry shows promise for supporting orbit discrimination and deconfusion of directly imaged multi-planet systems, and should be considered when fitting orbits to detections.",

This study critically evaluates the accuracy and reliability of publicly available ephemeris data for a LEO mega-constellation - Starlink. The goal of this work is twofold: (i) compare and analyze the quality of the data against high-precision numerical propagation. (ii) Leverage Physics-Informed Machine Learning to extract relevant satellite quantities, such as non-conservative forces, during the decay process. By analyzing two months of real orbital data for approximately 1500 Starlink satellites, we identify discrepancies between high precision numerical algorithms and the published ephemerides, recognizing the use of simplified dynamics at fixed thresholds, planned maneuvers, and limitations in uncertainty propagations. Furthermore, we compare data obtained from multiple sources to track and analyze deorbiting satellites over the same period. Empirically, we extract the acceleration profile of satellites during deorbiting and provide insights relating to the effects of non-conservative forces during reentry. For non-deorbiting satellites, the position Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was approximately 300 m, while for deorbiting satellites it increased to about 600 m. Through this in-depth analysis, we highlight potential limitations in publicly available data for accurate and robust Space Situational Awareness (SSA), and importantly, we propose a data-driven model of satellite decay in mega-constellations.",

Turner 31 pages, 12 pages, accepted and under embargo in Nature Communications Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Atmospheric escape of planets on short orbital periods, driven by the host star's irradiation, influences their evolution, composition, and atmospheric dynamics. Our main avenue to probe atmospheric escape is through the near-infrared metastable helium triplet, which has enabled mass loss rate measurements for tens of exoplanets. Among them, only a few studies show evidence for out-of-transit absorption, supporting the presence of a hydrodynamic outflow. However, none of these observations precisely identified the physical extent of the outflow, either due to non-continuous or short-duration observations. This limits our measurements of accurate mass loss rates. Here we present the first continuous, full-orbit helium phase curve monitoring of an exoplanet, the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b, obtained with JWST/NIRISS. It reveals helium absorption for nearly 60% of the orbit at >3sigma significance. Our results show that WASP-121b sustains a strong outflow, separating into two tails trailing and leading the planet. The persistent absorption from these tails, together with their measured radial velocity shifts, suggests that they remain in a collisional fluid regime at large distances from the planet and display very different dynamics. The leading trail has a higher density and moves toward the star, whereas the trailing trail is being pushed away from the star, with the latter being blue-shifted due to stellar irradiation pressure. While qualitatively agreeing with theoretical expectations, the observed structure of helium is not self-consistently reproducible by current models, limiting constraints on the mass loss rate. Furthermore, we show that while ground-based observations of the helium triplet are essential to measure the outflow dynamics precisely, they ideally should be combined with continuous JWST phase curves to constrain the absolute level of helium absorption.",

We extend previous studies to revise the maximum lifetime of these objects due to planetary, lunar and sublunar tidal migration. Using the Euler-Lagrange equation with a tidal dissipation process as specified by the Constant Geometric Lag model, we derive and solve the governing equations numerically to map the semi-major axis parameter space for star-planet-moon-submoon systems in which the submoon could be massive enough to host life. We find that Earth could have hosted asteroid-sized submoons ($\\sim10^{15}\\mathrm{kg}$), whereas a submoon near the previously proposed upper limit ($\\sim4.6\\cdot10^{17}\\mathrm{kg}$) would have driven the Moon $\\sim30\\%$ farther from Earth than its current orbit. A Warm Jupiter system like Kepler1625 has greater potential of hosting a massive submoon. We found that a submoon of around $10\\%M_{\\text{Luna}}$ could survive if Kepler1625b's hypothesized moon were $68\\%$ farther away then what the best-fit model suggests ($67R_{\\mathrm{p}}$ instead of $40R_{\\mathrm{p}}$). Giant submoons of mass $1.8M_{\\oplus}$ are stable in a Kepler1625-like system. In these cases, the moon orbit is wide ($> 100R_{\\mathrm{p}}$). Decreasing the submoon mass to a habitability prerequisite of $0.5M_{\\oplus}$, likely needed for a stable atmosphere and plate tectonics, leads to a smaller total number of stable iterations relative to the $m_{sm}=1.8M_{\\oplus}$ case. In fact, we identified a minimum number of stable iterations on intermediate submoon mass-scales of around $0.1M_{\\oplus}$. This is likely due to an interplay between small tidal forces at small submoon masses and small Roche-Limits at very high submoon masses. If submoon formation pathways in Warm Jupiter systems prefer such intermediate mass-scales, habitable submoons could be a rare phenomenon.",

Submitted to journal for peer review, feedback is welcome and appreciated Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) Recently a new meteoritic mineral, Zolenskyite (Fe0.99Mn0.04Ca0.01Cr1.99S3.98), was discovered from the Indarch meteorite. Zolenskyite was structurally indexed as the monoclinic C2/m CrNb2Se4 - Cr3S4 type structure of synthetic FeCr2S4, with unit cell parameters a = 12.84(1) Å, b = 3.44(1) Å, c = 5.94(1) Å and \\b{eta} = 117(1)°. Zolenskyite was reported as high-pressure phase formed from Daubréelite at high pressures and temperatures in highly shocked regions of the EH parent asteroid. Although this discovery provides valuable information about the origin of meteoritic mineral assemblages, the results and conclusions raise controversies with those reported in previous articles where the synthetic FeCr2S4 was described. In this review, an alternative analysis of the supplementary X-ray data from Zolenskyite was made and yields to the monoclinic I2/m Cr3S4 type structure of synthetic FeCr2S4, with unit cell parameters a = 5.940 Å, b = 3.440 Å, c = 11.441 Å and \\b{eta} = 90.55°, in agreement with previous results in the literature and differ from those reported above. Regarding the genesis of Zolenskyite and according to solid-state laboratory synthesis, the transformation of cubic FeCr2S4 phase (ideal composition of Daubréelite) to monoclinic FeCr2S4 (ideal composition of Zolenskyite) requires a process whose replication in Shock metamorphism stages is not well established and remains an open issue to address, together with another open issue related to the real composition of meteoritic minerals, with minor and trace metals, which is often overlooked when compared with synthetic ideal compositions. Whatever the results to be obtained by addressing the above open issues, they will shed more light on the genesis of Zolenskyite. In this context, it is worth to promote an open debate about the hypothesis of artificial origin.",

Oza, Christoph Mordasini 17 pages + 4 pages of Appendix. Accepted in Astronomy & Astrophysics Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We investigate the origin and stability of extrasolar satellites orbiting close-in gas giants, focusing on whether these satellites can survive planetary migration within a protoplanetary disk. To address this question, we used Posidonius, an N-Body code with an integrated tidal model, which we expanded to account for the migration of a gas giant within a disk. Our simulations include tidal interactions between a $1M_\\odot$ star and a $1M_{Jup}$ planet, as well as between the planet and its satellite, while neglecting tides raised by the star on the satellite. We adopt a standard equilibrium tide model for the satellite, planet, and star, and additionally explore the impact of dynamical tides in the convective regions of both the star and planet on satellite survival. We examine key parameters, including the initial satellite-planet distance, disk lifetime (proxy for the planet's final orbital distance), satellite mass, and satellite tidal dissipation. For simulations incorporating dynamical tides, we explore three different initial stellar rotation periods. We find that satellite survival is rare if the satellite has nonzero tidal dissipation. Survival is only possible for initial orbital distances of at least 0.6 times the Jupiter-Io separation and for planets orbiting beyond about 0.1 AU. Satellites that fail to survive are either 1) tidally disrupted, as they experience orbital decay and cross the Roche limit, or 2) dynamically disrupted, where eccentricity excitation drives their periastron within the Roche limit. Satellite survival is more likely for low tidal dissipation and higher satellite mass. Given that satellites around close-in planets appear unlikely to survive planetary migration, our findings suggest that if such satellites do exist, another process should be invoked. In that context, we also discuss the claim of the existence of a putative satellite around WASP-49 A b.",

Konopacky, Jayke S. Nguyen, Patrick Diamond, Krzysztof Goździewski, Dawid Jankowski 34 pages, 21 figures. Accepted to ApJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Direct imaging has revealed exoplanet systems hosting multiple wide-orbit Super-Jupiters, where planet-planet interactions can shape their long-term dynamical evolution. These strong perturbations may lead to orbital instability, raising questions about the long-term survival of such systems. Shortly after formation, planet-disk interactions can shepherd planets into mean-motion resonances, which may promote long-term stability as seen in HR 8799. However, early-stage processes such as disk photoevaporation and viscosity can influence these outcomes. The $\\sim$5 Myr-old PDS 70 system offers a unique laboratory to investigate these processes: its two massive ($>$4 $M_{Jup}$), wide-orbit ($>$20 AU) giants are still embedded in their natal disk. We perform 2D hydrodynamic simulations of the system, allowing the disk to disperse via photoevaporation. Once the disk dissipates, we continue to track the planets' orbital evolution over Gyr timescales using N-body simulations. We find that the system is likely to remain stable for $>$ 1 Gyr. To assess the importance of disk-driven evolution, we compare these results with disk-free N-body simulations using orbital parameters constrained by orbit fits that include recent relative astrometry and radial velocities from the literature. In this case, we find that only $\\lesssim 4\\%$ of posterior is stable for 100 Myr, highlighting the importance of considering disk-driven evolution for long-term dynamics stability of exoplanetary systems. We also simulate two three-planet configurations including the proposed inner candidate \"PDS 70 d\", finding that a higher photoevaporation leads the system to become unstable in $<$ 10 Myr.",

Structure of the resonance mesh, applications to Chariklo, Haumea and Quaoar Bruno Sicardy, Heikki Salo, Maryame El Moutamid, Stefan Renner, Damya Souami 15 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables, accepted in Astronomy and Astrophysics Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Three ring systems have been discovered to date around small irregular objects of the solar system (Chariklo, Haumea and Quaoar). For the three bodies, material is observed near the second-order 1/3 Spin-Orbit Resonance (SOR) with the central object, and in the case of Quaoar, a ring is also observed near the second-order resonance 5/7 SOR. This suggests that second-order SORs may play a central role in ring confinement. This paper aims at better understanding this role from a theoretical point of view. It also provides a basis to better interpret the results obtained from N-body simulations and presented in a companion paper. A Hamiltonian approach yields the topological structure of phase portraits for SORs of orders from one to five. Two cases of non-axisymmetric potentials are examined: a triaxial ellipsoid characterized by an elongation parameter C22 and a body with mass anomaly mu, a dimensionless parameter that measures the dipole component of the body's gravitational field. The estimated triaxial shape of Chariklo shows that its corotation points are marginally unstable, those of Haumea are largely unstable, while those of Quaoar are safely stable. The topologies of the phase portraits show that only first- (aka Lindblad) and second-order SORs can significantly perturb a dissipative collisional ring. We calculate the widths, the maximum eccentricities and excitation time scales associated with first- and second-order SORs, as a function of C22 and mu. Applications to Chariklo, Haumea and Quaoar using mu ~ 0.001 show that the first- and second-order SORs caused by their triaxial shapes excite large (>~ 0.1) orbital eccentricities on the particles, making the regions inside the 1/2 SOR inhospitable for rings. Conversely, the 1/3 and 5/7 SORs caused by mass anomalies excite moderate eccentricities (<~ 0.01), and are thus a more favorable place for the presence of a ring.",

Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The population of ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) provide unique opportunities to probe the extreme formation and evolutionary pathways in exoplanets. Owing to their very high temperatures and inflated atmospheres, UHJs are among the most favorable targets for both transmission and emission spectroscopy, enabling detailed characterization of their atmospheric properties. Here, we present a reanalysis of the JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectra of the extreme ultra-hot Jupiter (EUHJ) WASP-178b, aimed at precisely characterizing its atmospheric composition. Our approach combines data reduction using two independent pipelines, lightcurve modeling with robust detrending techniques, and rigorous atmospheric retrievals. We report statistically significant detections of CO (7.24 $\\sigma$) and CO$_2$ (7.22 $\\sigma$), along with marginal evidence for C$_2$H$_2$ (1.34 $\\sigma$), but no clear evidence for H$_2$O, suggesting depletion. From these retrieved abundances, we constrain the C/O ratio to a precise super-solar value of 0.954$\\pm$0.033, consistent with an emerging trend in other UHJs. We also infer a very high atmospheric metallicity for a Jupiter-sized gas giant$\\unicode{x2014}$11.44$_{-6.94}^{+12.54}$ $\\times$solar$\\unicode{x2014}$indicating unique atmospheric evolutions.

Zúñiga-Fernández Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Giant planets orbiting low-mass stars on short orbits present a conundrum, as in the most extreme cases their existence cannot be reconciled with current models of core accretion. Therefore, surveys dedicated to finding these rare planets have a key role to play by growing the sample to overcome small number statistics. In this work we present MANGOS, a programme dedicated to the search for giant objects (planets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stars) orbiting M dwarfs. We report on the discovery of five new giant planets (TOI-3288 Ab, TOI-4666 b, TOI-5007 b, TOI-5292 Ab, TOI-5916 b) first detected by TESS, and confirmed using ground-based photometry and spectroscopy. The five planets have radii in the range 0.99-1.12 $\\mathrm{R_{Jup}}$, masses between 0.49--1.69~$\\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$, and orbital periods between 1.43 and 2.91 days. We reveal that TOI-3288 and TOI-5292 are wide binaries, and in the case of TOI-5292 we are able to characterise both stellar components. We demonstrate that the planets presented are suitable for further characterisation of their obliquities and atmospheres. We detect a small but significant eccentricity for TOI-5007 b, although for this to be more robust, more observations are needed to fully sample the orbit. Finally, we reveal a correlation between stellar metallicity and planet bulk density for giant planets orbiting low-mass stars.",

Watkins Submitted to A&A on 10 October 2025, 21 pages, 23 figures, abstract shortened Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Gas giant planets orbiting low-mass stars are uncommon outcomes of planet formation. Increasing the sample of well-characterised giants around early M dwarfs will enable population-level studies of their properties, offering valuable insights into their formation and evolutionary histories. We aim to characterise giant exoplanets transiting M dwarfs identified by TESS. High-resolution spectroscopic data are obtained in the optical and nIR, combining HARPS and NIRPS. We derive RVs via the cross-correlation function and implement a novel post-processing procedure to further mitigate telluric contamination in the nIR. The resulting RVs are jointly fit with TESS and ground-based photometry to derive the orbital and physical parameters of the systems. We confirm two gas giants transiting the low-mass stars TOI-3288 A (K9V) and TOI-4666 (M2.5V). TOI-3288 A hosts a Hot Jupiter with a mass of $2.11\\pm0.08~M_{\\rm Jup}$ and a radius of $1.00 \\pm 0.03~R_{\\rm Jup}$, with an orbital period of 1.43 days ($T_{\\rm eq} = 1059 \\pm 20~{\\rm K}$). TOI-4666 hosts a $0.70_{-0.06}^{+0.05}~M_{\\rm Jup}$ warm Jupiter ($T_{\\rm eq} = 713 \\pm 14~{\\rm K}$) with a radius of $1.11 \\pm 0.04~R_{\\rm Jup}$, and an orbital period of 2.91 days. We identify a decrease in planetary mass with spectral type, where late M dwarfs host less massive giant planets than early M dwarfs. More massive gas giants that deviate from this trend are preferentially hosted by more metal-rich stars. Furthermore, we find an increased binarity fraction among low-mass stars hosting gas giants, which may play a role in enhancing giant planet formation around low-mass stars. The observed population trends agree with theoretical expectations, where higher metallicity can compensate for lower disk masses, and wide binary systems may influence planet formation and migration through Kozai-Lidov cycles or disk instabilities.",

A giant impact on Venus could have affected its rotation rate and possibly its thermal evolution. In this work, we explore a range of possible impacts using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We consider the final major collision, assuming that differentiation already occurred and that Venus consists of an iron core (30% of Venus' mass) and a forsterite mantle (70% of Venus' mass). We use differentiated impactors with masses ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 Earth masses, impact velocities between 10 and 15 km/s, various impact geometries (head-on and oblique), different primordial thermal profiles, and a range of pre-impact rotation rates of Venus. We analyse the post-impact rotation periods and debris disc masses to identify scenarios that can reproduce Venus' present-day characteristics. Our findings show that a wide range of impact scenarios are consistent with Venus' current rotation. These include head-on collisions on a non-rotating Venus and oblique, hit-and-run impacts by Mars-sized bodies on a rotating Venus. Importantly, collisions that match Venus' present-day rotation rate typically produce minimal debris discs residing within Venus' synchronous orbit. This suggests that the material would likely reaccrete onto the planet, preventing the formation of long-lasting satellites - consistent with Venus' lack of a moon. We conclude that a giant impact can be consistent with both Venus' unusual rotation and lack of a moon, potentially setting the stage for its subsequent thermal evolution.",

We perform a suite of atmospheric retrievals on both datasets, including free-chemistry, non-equilibrium, and aerosol models, using laboratory-derived complex refractive indices for a variety of photochemical haze analogues. Free retrievals systematically return lower metallicities than inferred by self-consistent chemical disequilibrium models, and the inclusion of absorbing aerosols, especially CH4-dominated, nitrogen-poor tholins, can further reduce the inferred metallicity by over an order of magnitude. These hazes reproduce the observed NIRISS slope through scattering and match MIRI features via C-H bending absorption near 7 um, while yielding particle properties consistent with photochemical production in H2-rich atmospheres. Although their inclusion improves the joint fit and reduces tension between datasets, it also significantly lowers the retrieved CH4 abundance, highlighting degeneracies between metallicity, composition, and aerosol properties.
