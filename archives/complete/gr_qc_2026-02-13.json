This generalizes Choptuik's D=4 solution to spherically symmetric massless scalar-field collapse at the threshold of D-dimensional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole formation. We refer to these solutions, which share the discrete self-similarity of their four-dimensional counterpart, as critical spacetime crystals. Our main results are the echoing period and Choptuik exponent of the crystals as continuous functions of D, with detailed data for the interval 3.05<D<5.5. Notably, the echoing period has a maximum near D=3.76. As a by-product, we recover the echoing periods and Choptuik exponents in D=4 (5): Delta=3.445453 (3.22176) and gamma=0.373961 (0.41322). We support these numerical results with analytical expansions in 1/D and D-3. They suggest that both the echoing period and Choptuik exponent vanish as D approaches 3 from above. This paves the way for a small-(D-3) expansion, paralleling the large-$D$ expansion of general relativity. We also extend our results to two-dimensional dilaton gravity.",

Shojai General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) This paper examines a recently introduced class of regular black holes that can form from the collapse of a polytropic star with an arbitrary polytropic index. This class has a de Sitter core and reduces to the Bardeen and Hayward black holes when the polytropic index is chosen appropriately. We demonstrate that this class of black holes is sourced by a nonlinear electrodynamics Lagrangian in $d$ dimensions and that its regularity stems from the presence of magnetic charge. We analyze the energy conditions and study the photon spheres analytically and the shadows numerically. Then, we compare our results with observations. Additionally, we present the thermodynamic properties of this class of black holes, including their temperature, entropy, and heat capacity. We also examine their thermodynamic stability. Finally, we generalize the Oppenheimer-Snyder-Datt collapse scenario to this $d$-dimensional class of black holes and study stellar collapse into them, as well as the evolution of the star's surface, the apparent horizon, and the event horizon.",

To such a level, some new accelerations make their appearance. They are proportional to even and odd powers of the hole's angular momentum. Their counterparts are not known where the primary is a material body. After expressing them in a coordinate-independent, vector form valid for any orientations of the hole's spin axis in space, their orbital effects are perturbatively worked out in terms of the particle's Keplerian orbital elements. The resulting expressions, averaged over one orbital revolution, are valid for generic shapes and inclinations of the orbit. The orbital plane's precession proportional to the first power of the hole's angular momentum and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light amounts to about twenty per cent of the corresponding Lense-Thirring effect. The latter is believed to be the cause of the accurately measured disk/jet precessional phenomenology, currently measured to a few per cent accuracy. Although at a lesser extent, also the precession proportional to the second power of the hole's spin and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light is measurable. Allowed domains in the parameter space of the jet precession around M87$^\\ast$ are displayed.",

While a full theory of Quantum Gravity remains elusive, studying quantum fields on curved backgrounds provides essential insights into the early Universe. We focus on how dynamical spacetimes, particularly during inflation, generate particles from spectator fields influenced solely by geometry. The work is divided into four parts. Part I establishes the theoretical framework, covering cosmology, inflation, and the principles of analog gravity. Part II analyzes particle production in various inflationary models, showing that scalar and vector fields can account for observed dark matter abundance, especially through tachyonic instabilities. Part III explores BEC experiments, mapping phonons to scalar fields in expanding universes. We demonstrate the reconstruction of expansion histories, reinterpret production as a scattering problem, and propose methods to measure entanglement between produced pairs. Finally, Part IV addresses quantum vacuum ambiguities and the impact of non-adiabatic transitions during the \"switch-on\" and \"switch-off\" of expansion. Ultimately, this work highlights the viability of cosmological particle production for dark matter and the power of analog experiments to enhance our understanding of quantum effects in curved spacetimes.",

We consider axi dilaton, dynamical Chern Simons, and scalar Gauss Bonnet couplings, and obtain leading order solutions for both the scalar field and the associated metric modifications. Our method accurately resolves massive scalar fields with Compton wavelengths as short as 5 times the black hole mass, achieving residual errors $\\lesssim 10^{-5}$, and yields the corresponding leading order spacetime modifications with residual errors $\\lesssim 10^{-3}$. Using the constructed spacetimes, we computes the leading-order shifts in the surface gravity and the angular velocity of the event horizon, important information for computing the quasinormal modes. These results pave the way to incorporate massive scalar charges into electromagnetic observations and gravitational-wave detections of black holes, potentially enabling new probes of fundamental scalar degrees of freedom.",

We construct a self-consistent spacetime describing a slowly rotating black hole embedded in an external matter distribution, modeling the surrounding dark matter halo as an anisotropic fluid. Working within the slow-rotation approximation, we capture leading-order spin and frame-dragging effects while retaining analytic transparency. We show that the presence and rotation of the halo induce distinct deviations from the vacuum black hole geometry, modifying inertial frame dragging, equatorial circular geodesics, the light ring, the innermost stable circular orbit, and radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies. These effects produce systematic shifts in orbital constants of motion and the locations of epicyclic resonances. In particular, the epicyclic frequency ratios develop nonmonotonic behavior, such as local minima. We further demonstrate that these features depend on the angular velocity of the surrounding fluid, reflecting the interplay between environmental gravity and frame dragging. Our results demonstrate that environmental and rotational effects can leave observable imprints on precision strong-field probes, particularly extreme mass-ratio inspirals, where small corrections accumulate over many orbital cycles. This work provides a minimal and extensible framework for incorporating realistic astrophysical environments into strong-field tests of gravity with future space-based gravitational-wave detectors.",

      "abstract": "Quantum Cosmology in $f(R, T)$ Theory with Schutz's Perfect Fluid Serkan Doruk Hazinedar, Yaghoub Heydarzade, Shahram Jalalzadeh General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The $f(R, T)$ theory of gravity extends general relativity (GR) by allowing the gravitational Lagrangian to depend on both the Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. The resulting matter-geometry coupling introduces additional dynamical effects that may account for the late-time acceleration of the universe without invoking dark energy. In the present work, we focus instead on the early-time regime and investigate the corresponding quantum cosmological dynamics. We analyze a Friedmann--Lemaitre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) universe within the $f(R, T)$ framework, employing Schutz's perfect fluid formalism to extract a time parameter emerging from the matter sector itself. This approach is particularly well motivated in $f(R, T)$ gravity, where the coupling between geometry and the energy-momentum tensor's trace makes matter an active participant in the dynamics of spacetime and the evolution of cosmic time. The gravitational Hamiltonian, canonical momenta, and potential are derived, leading to the corresponding Schrödinger--Wheeler--DeWitt (SWDW) equation. The wave function of the universe is obtained for specific forms of $f(R, T)$, and the results are compared with previous studies in $f(R)$ and $f(R, T)$ models, highlighting the role of matter-geometry coupling in the emergence of quantum cosmological dynamics.",

Starting from a Vaidya-type geometry with a radially dependent mass function, we demonstrate that regularization of the Kiselev solutions can be achieved through a physically motivated modification of the energy density profile. This procedure leads to nonsingular spacetimes with a de~Sitter core and finite curvature invariants at the center. We show that the resulting matter content is naturally described by a generalized polytropic equation of state of the form $P=\\alpha\\rho-\\zeta\\rho^{\\gamma}$, where the polytropic index $\\gamma$ is uniquely determined by the regularization scheme. Within this framework, we obtain exact dynamical generalizations of several well-known regular black hole solutions, including the Hayward and Bardeen spacetimes, as particular cases corresponding to specific values of the polytropic parameters. Remarkably, the requirement that the equation of state remains coordinate independent imposes a universal constraint relating the regularization scale to the mass function, which in turn guarantees the existence of a regular de~Sitter core with a curvature scale independent of the black hole mass. Our results provide a unified analytic description of Hayward-like and Bardeen-like black holes emerging from gravitational collapse, offering a consistent effective-matter interpretation rooted in generalized polytropic matter.",

Gingrich General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We study the collapse and possible bounce of dust in quantum-inspired gravity models with spherical symmetry. Starting from a wide class of spherically symmetric spacetimes, we write down the covariant Hamiltonian constraints that under dynamical flow give rise to metrics of many spherically symmetric gravity models. Gravity is minimally coupled to a dust field. The constraint equations are solved for the Hamiltonian evolution and simple equations for the location of the outer boundary of the dust versus time and the apparent horizons in terms of shape functions are obtained. The dust density is not assumed to be homogeneous inside the collapsing ball. In many cases, the effective quantum gravity effects stop the collapse of the dust matter field, then causes the dust field to expand thus creating a bounce at a minimum radius and avoiding the classical singularity. Using this formalism, we examine several quantum-inspired gravity metrics to obtain bounce results either previously obtained by different methods or new results.",

Starting from a general metric characterized by an arbitrary lapse function and areal radius, we derive curvature invariants, establish regularity conditions at the wormhole throat, and reduce the Klein-Gordon equation to a Helmholtz-type radial wave equation. This formulation naturally leads to a position- and frequency-dependent effective refractive index determined by the underlying spacetime geometry and Lorentz-violating structure, resulting in effective frequency-dependent wave-optical behavior. We show that divergences of the refractive index coincide with Killing horizons, while curvature-induced turning points control reflection, transmission, and confinement of scalar waves. By analyzing constant, linear, and quadratic lapse profiles, we identify horizonless transmission regimes, asymmetric wave propagation, and multi-horizon trapping structures. Our results reveal that Lorentz violation can significantly modify wave-optical properties of curved spacetime, generating graded-index analogues and geometric confinement of modes without curvature singularities. This unified optical perspective provides a robust framework for investigating wave scattering, resonances, and potential observational signatures in Lorentz-violating gravitational backgrounds.",

Rev. D 113, 043019 (2026) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We demonstrate Bayesian analyses of the complete gravitational-wave spectrum of binary neutron star mergers events with the next-generation detector Einstein Telescope. Our mock analyses are performed for 20 different signals using the TEOBResumSPA_NRPMw waveform that models gravitational-waves from the inspiral to the postmerger phase. They are employed to validate a pipeline for neutron star's extreme matter constraints with prospective detections and under minimal hypotheses on the equation of state. The proposed analysis stack delivers inferences for the mass-radius curve, the mass dependence of the quadrupolar tidal polarizability parameter, the neutron star's maximum density, the maximum mass and the relative radius, and the pressure-density relation itself. We show that a single event at a signal-to-noise ratio close to the minimum threshold for postmerger detection is sufficient to tightly constrain all the above relations as well as quantities like the maximum mass (maximum density) to precision of ${\\sim}6$% (${\\sim}10$%) at 90% credibility level. We also revisit inferences of prompt black hole formation with full spectrum signals and find that the latter can be robustly identified, even when the postmerger is not detectable due to a low signal-to-noise ratio. New results on the impact of the initial signal frequency and of the detector configuration (triangular vs. two-L) on the source's parameters estimation are also reported. An improvement of approximately one order of magnitude in the precision of the chirp mass and mass ratio can be achieved by lowering the initial frequency from 20 Hz to 2 Hz. The two-L configuration shows instead significant improvements on the inference of the source declination, due to geographical separation of the two detectors.",

We show that the equations of motion for null geodesics are separable and admit analytical treatment, whereas timelike geodesics are generally non-separable. Approximate analytical expressions for the photon sphere and the innermost stable circular orbit are derived via perturbative expansions in the magnetic field strength. We further explore the black hole shadow using both numerical and analytical methods, examining the effects of the magnetic field, the observer's inclination angle and radial position. Deviations from the standard Kerr shadow are quantified, and a physical interpretation is provided by introducing asymptotic regimes defined relative to the magnetic field strength.",

These events are crucial for understanding the population properties of compact binaries. However, many previous studies rely on computationally expensive inference frameworks, limiting their scalability. In this work, we present GWKokab, a JAX-based framework that enables modular model building with independent rate for each subpopulation such as BBH, BNS, and NSBH binaries. It provides accelerated inference using the normalizing flow based sampler called flowMC and is also compatible with NumPyro samplers. To validate our framework, we generated two synthetic populations, one comprising spinning eccentric binaries and the other circular binaries using a multi-source model. We then recovered their injected parameters at significantly reduced computational cost and demonstrated that eccentricity distribution can be recovered even in spinning eccentric populations. We also reproduced results from two prior studies: one on non-spinning eccentric populations, and another on the BBH mass distribution using the third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4). We anticipate that GWKokab will not only reduce computational costs but also enable more detailed subpopulation analyses such as their mass, spin, eccentricity, and redshift distributions in gravitational wave events, offering deeper insights into compact binary formation and evolution.",

We derive the master wave equations for massless electromagnetic and Dirac perturbations and solve them using the standard Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method along with Padé Averaging. From these solutions, we extract the dominant and overtone quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies along with the associated grey-body factors, highlighting the deviations introduced by quantum gravity corrections compared to the classical case of Reissner-Nordström black hole.

In this work, we investigate the bound and unbound trajectories of charged particles in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in an external, uniform magnetic field. By analyzing the effective potential and solving the corresponding equations of motion, we classify the possible orbital configurations and identify the critical parameters governing the transition between stable and escape trajectories. The influence of the magnetic field strength and particle charge on the orbital structure, energy, and angular momentum is systematically explored. Applications of the obtained results are discussed in the context of the S2 star orbiting Sagittarius A* and the motion of bright hotspots detected near the event horizon, offering a potential interpretation of recent observations in terms of magnetized dynamics. The study contributes to a deeper understanding of charged-particle motion around black holes and its relevance to high-energy astrophysical phenomena in the galactic center. Finally, we test our model by fitting it to real data from the observed trajectory of the S2 star using a statistical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. This allows us to find the best estimates for magnetic field and charge of the S2 star.",

Using the zoom-whirl taxonomy, which is characterized by three topological numbers $(z, w, v)$, we classify these orbits and calculate several representative gravitational waveforms for certain periodic orbits. We find that the noncommutative parameter $\\Theta$ and the quintessence field significantly modify both the orbital structure and the emitted waveforms. In particular, increasing $\\Theta$ leads to a phase shift and a change in amplitude in the waveform, while higher zoom numbers produce more complicated substructures. The characteristic strain spectra peak in the millihertz range, lying within the sensitivity band of the LISA detector. Moreover, the presence of the quintessence field introduces significant modifications to these waveforms, imprinting measurable deviations that could be tested or constrained by future space-based gravitational wave detectors. These results suggest that future space-based gravitational wave missions could probe or constrain noncommutative effects in strong gravitational fields.",

However, finding an SGWB with a single orbiting detector is challenging: It calls for cautious modelling of instrumental noise, which is also mainly stochastic. It was shown that agnostic noise reconstruction methods provide robustness in the detection process. We build on previous work to include more realistic instrumental simulations and additional degrees of freedom in the noise inference model and analyze the impact of LISA's sensitivity to SGWBs. Particularly, we model the two main types of noise sources with separate transfer functions and power spectral density spline fitting. We assess the detectability bounds and their dependence on the flexibility of the noise model and on the prior probability, allowing us to refine previously reported results.",

It is well known that models with single perfect fluid or single scalar field minimally coupled to Einstein gravity develop perturbative instabilities around the crossing, thereby cannot realize the quintom scenario. In this paper, we propose a method to circumvent the instability problem of these models by considering the coupling of dark energy to the Nieh-Yan density within the framework of teleparallel gravity. We show that with this coupling the background evolution is not affected, but the dark energy perturbation is removed from the menu of dynamical degrees of freedom, thus avoiding the inherent difficulties in the old models. Furthermore, the Nieh-Yan coupling causes parity violation in gravitational waves, and this can be considered as a clear prediction of this mechanism.",
