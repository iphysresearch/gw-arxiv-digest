Comments are welcome General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We develop a radial integral reformulation of finite distance gravitational lensing in optical geometry for static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. Starting from the Gauss-Bonnet characterization of the finite distance deflection angle, we adopt the Li-type curvature primitive identity [this https URL] [2006.13047], which reduces the curvature-area contribution to a one-dimensional integral evaluated along the physical light ray. We then remove the remaining implicit orbit dependence by an explicit change of variables using the null first integrals, converting the Li line integral from $\\phi$-integration to $r$-integration and splitting the trajectory at the turning point (closest approach). The resulting formula expresses the deflection angle as a sum of two radial integrals over $[r_0,r_S]$ and $[r_0,r_R]$ plus the finite distance angular bookkeeping term, with a transparent normalization/cancellation structure for the curvature primitive. In Schwarzschild gauge, we provide a weak-field evaluation toolkit that reduces the computation to reusable families of standard radial integrals and gives compact expressions for the endpoint incidence angles in the optical metric. Worked examples include Schwarzschild and Kottler (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) spacetimes and a black hole immersed in perfect-fluid dark matter with a finite halo. For the finite-halo model we derive closed-form leading weak-deflection expressions for mixed endpoint configurations (source/receiver inside or outside the halo), illustrating the modularity of the radial Gauss-Bonnet pipeline.",

The analysis is carried out using a Legendre invariant formalism called Geometrothermodynamics (GTD) which is applied to a quasihomogeneous system generated by the NCRN BH. This formalism enables the study of phase transitions by locating Ricci scalar singularities, from which the phase transition points are determined in terms of the thermodynamic variables. We also examine how the noncommutative (NC) parameter can be interpreted as a thermodynamic variable within quasi-homogeneous thermodynamic laws, highlighting its potential role on phase transitions beyond those well-known characterized by divergences in the heat capacity.",

The master field equations for spherically symmetric gravitational fields, recently constructed from two-dimensional Horndeski theory, allow us to retain partial contributions from higher-curvature truncations of the effective action, while preserving the second-order nature of the resulting field equations. Static RG-improved black-hole spacetimes with an effective gravitational coupling depending on the areal radius and the Misner-Sharp mass are derived as vacuum solutions to these master field equations, and are thereby identified as solutions to generally covariant two-dimensional Horndeski theories. We discuss explicitly the embedding of previous key works on RG-improvement into the newly developed formalism to illustrate its broad range of applicability. This formalism moreover allows us to establish explicitly the discrepancies in the outcomes of RG-improvement when implemented at the level of the action, in the field equations, or in the Schwarzschild solution.",

We consider time-dependent Newton ``constant\" $G$, the cosmological term $\\Lambda$ and non-conserved $T^{\\mu\\nu}$. The Bianchi identity imposes a relation between the energy-momentum (non)conservation and the variation of $G$ and $\\Lambda$.

We apply thermodynamics in order to express the non-conservation of the energy-momentum of an ideal fluid by entropy and relate the time variations of $G$ and $\\Lambda$ to a change of entropy.

      "abstract": "Dissipative Unimodular Gravity: Linking Energy Diffusion to Bulk Viscosity as an Alternative to $Λ$CDM under DESI DR2 Data Norman Cruz, Esteban González General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this paper, we explore a theoretical and observational study of the presence of viscosity in the Unimodular Gravity formalism, a pioneering approach that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously explored in this context. Specifically, we study a flat FLRW universe at late times, where matter experiences dissipative processes in the form of a bulk viscosity, in the framework of Eckart's theory, which is linked to the energy diffusion function $Q$ through the power law $\\xi=\\xi_{0}\\left|Q\\right|^{1/2}$, being $\\xi_{0}$ a positive dimensionless parameter. By assuming the ansatz $Q=\\nu H^{2}$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter and $\\nu$ is a dimensionless arbitrary constant, we find analytical solutions for the cosmological evolution. We test these models against the most recent cosmological observations, including type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic chronometers, gravitational lensing, and black hole shadow data. Our results show that two of the tested models provide a significantly better fit to the data ($\\chi_{\\text{min}}^{2}$) and remain as competitive as $\\Lambda$CDM model according to the Bayesian Information Criterion. These findings, combined with the inherent ability of Unimodular Gravity to alleviate the cosmological constant problem, position dissipative UG as a robust and compelling alternative to the standard model, potentially suggesting that a very small but nontrivial energy nonconservation is compatible with the late-time observational data.",

Because the Newman--Janis algorithm is generically incompatible with a cosmological-constant fluid, we instead propose a generalized Kerr--Schild construction on a (possibly scale-dependent $\\Lambda$) de Sitter seed, yielding a Carter-type metric characterized by a mass function and a $\\Lambda$ function. Our construction provides a direct map from static, spherically symmetric regular models to their rotating counterparts. We derive sharp regularity conditions at the ring and we identify a minimal-order subclass. We analyze chronology and show that, for non-negative mass function and $\\Lambda$ above a certain negative limit, the spacetimes are stably causal. For minimal-order geometries with non-negative mass, we prove that the weak energy condition must be violated. Finally, we illustrate the framework with an asymptotic-safety--inspired model and discuss horizon structure, surface gravities, and conformal diagrams. These results provide a controlled, observationally oriented arena to confront regular rotating black holes in dark-energy backgrounds with the rapidly improving gravitational-wave and horizon-scale imaging data.",

By constructing the simplest consistent ansatz within the gauged Skyrme-Maxwell framework, we reveal a remarkable equivalence in a sector that admits nonvanishing, highly magnetized baryonic charge. This correspondence has a particularly appealing consequence: it transfers the full power of solution-generating techniques developed for electrovacuum systems-many of which naturally accommodate scalar fields to the considerably more intricate setting of gauged Skyrme-Maxwell theory minimally coupled to General Relativity. As a result, it opens the door to a systematic and much broader exploration of exact solutions in Skyrme-Maxwell-Einstein theory and of their potential applications in cosmology and astrophysics. Notably, the resulting configurations carry nonzero baryonic charge whenever the derivative of the hadronic profile along the magnetic field lines does not vanish. As an illustrative example, we apply this new dictionary to a rotating Kerr-Newman-like spacetime dressed with a scalar field. In the corresponding Skyrme-Maxwell-Einstein solution, the quantization of the baryonic charge enforces a quantization of the Kerr rotation parameter. We derive an upper bound on the baryonic charge in terms of the integration constants of the solution and show that, in the regime of small baryonic charge, the rotation parameter depends linearly on the baryonic charge.",

In this Letter, a no-go result is established for a broad class of single-field effective scalar cosmologies where the kinetic response is modulated by the Hubble expansion rate, a structural feature characteristic of infrared-modified and nonlocal gravity theories \\cite{DeserWoodard2007, Maggiore2014}. It is proved that imposing ghost freedom, defined by the positivity of the kinetic response function $\\mathcal{M} \\equiv \\partial\\rho/\\partial X > 0$, enforces the phantom divide ($w = -1$) as a \\textit{stability-protected boundary} in the cosmological phase space. While the equation of state can approach this limit arbitrarily closely, continuous ghost-free evolution into the phantom regime is shown to be strictly forbidden. The dynamics are found to converge toward a de~Sitter-like attractor where $w \\to -1$ emerges as a consequence of dynamical selection and stability rather than the fine-tuning of the scalar potential.

The resulting Hamiltonian contains distinct curvature couplings modifying the internal potential and affecting the center-of-mass dynamics. These contributions imply that internal-energy variations do not always reduce to mass renormalization and can induce genuine forces due to changes in momentum. The initial research was motivated by anomalous friction-like forces emerging in quantum optics, and clarified that the anomalous forces are mere relativistic corrections from mass-energy equivalence.

The oscillation frequency of the dominant mode grows with the field mass $\\mu$, while the damping rate decreases, suggesting the existence of quasi-resonances at sufficiently large $\\mu$. In the time domain, the late-time signal exhibits oscillatory tails with a power-law envelope, whose decay rate matches analytic expectations. Grey-body factors are also computed, showing strong suppression of radiation when mass is increased.

Oh General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We show that the gap in the compactness between black holes and neutron stars witnessed in general relativity may be vanishing in Hořava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity. Assuming a fermion equation-of-state for simplicity, and solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation within the HL gravity framework, we see that there exists a minimum fermion mass $m_f^\\text{(min)}(q,y)$, above which the gap of the compactness between black hole and fermionic compact object vanishes, for a given deformation parameter $q$ of HL and interaction strength $y$ between fermions. Thus, in HL gravity, the mass and radius of an object found in the lower mass gap by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observations might not be able to classify it as a black hole or a neutron star. It is interesting to note that a fermion of mass $\\sim 40\\ \\text{GeV}$ can form a highly compact object of mass $\\sim 10^{-4}\\ \\msun$ and radius $\\sim 1\\ \\text{m}$ that may play the role of the cold dark matter. In addition, we find the possible existence of another class of compact objects whose compactness is comparable to that of a black hole.",

These static orbits are further identified as the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) in this spacetime. If such static orbits form part of an accretion disk, they would give rise to a ring-like structure that is unaffected by Doppler shifts. Moreover, the Aschenbach effect is shown to be present: the orbital velocity of particles on timelike circular orbits, as measured by a zero angular momentum observer (ZAMO), displays a non-monotonic dependence on the radial coordinate. Additionally, the regions supporting stable circular orbits can be discontinuous, and particles on stable orbits near the center can possess specific energies greater than one ($E > 1$).",

Numerical simulations reveal that the massive scalar field in both semi-classical frameworks exhibits two distinct types of critical behavior, consistent with the classical scenario. When the scalar field's mass parameter is small, type II critical phenomena emerge, with the resulting echoing periods and critical exponents precisely matching those obtained in general relativity. In contrast, a large mass parameter triggers type I critical phenomena, where the resulting black holes possess a finite minimum mass.

Furthermore, we describe the finiteness of all thermodynamic quantities of the presented stellar solutions, including the effective thermodynamical quantities, for varying values of the deformation parameter and total electric charge. We explore the new interior astrophysical solutions in three-dimensional gravity by analyzing the charged BTZ metric, admitting circular symmetry through the principles of geometric deformation. This study examines the impact of radial-metric deformation on the charged BTZ geometry and underscores the importance of stellar decoupling within the context of electrically charged dense distributions.

This frequency band is dominated by the gravitational waves from inspiraling compact object binaries. Subtracting these signals is necessary to search for the primordial SGWB.

By quantifying statistical discrepancies between forward and backward temporal evolution of particle orbits, TRSE robustly distinguishes chaotic from regular dynamics in non-integrable systems. In contrast, integrable systems exhibit stable, symmetric probability distributions preserved by conserved quantities such as the Carter constant. We validate the method through high-precision numerical simulations in both Kerr and Schwarzschild-Melvin black hole geometries, evolving trajectories forward and backward in time. Furthermore, we refine our previously introduced particle-pair mutual information (MIPP) and perform comprehensive parameter-space scans, revealing a strong quantitative agreement between MIPP and TRSE. The two indicators emerge as complementary probes of chaos: TRSE captures symmetry breaking in orbital evolution, while MIPP measures statistical correlations. Together, they establish a unified framework for diagnosing chaos in general relativistic systems, paving a new path to understand the fundamental nature of chaos in non-integrable systems.",

The accurate quasinormal modes were computed by suitably adopting the continued fraction and integration-through-midpoints methods, depending on the structure of the singularity. The grey-body factor can be obtained through its correspondence with the quasinormal mode, and its accuracy was analyzed by calculating its difference from the numerically computed grey-body factor. The correspondence failed for $l=2$ scalar gravitational perturbations in $D\\ge7$ because the form of the potential is markedly different from that in four dimensions. The vector and tensor perturbation types exhibited good correspondence accuracies in all cases.

By construction, the shell's motion remains timelike throughout the entire evolution, regardless of the amount of initial stellar mass, and the induced metric on the shell remains continuous.

These geodesics form a complete congruence that covers the entire spacetime. By rectifying this family of trajectories using the proper time as the time coordinate, the Novikov variables naturally emerge, providing a clear dynamical interpretation of the different regions usually identified as black-hole and white-hole sectors. In Novikov coordinates, observers at fixed spatial position follow free-fall trajectories. From their perspective, the gravitational collapse of a dust star is completed in a finite proper time, independently of their initial distance from the star. In contrast, observers described by Schwarzschild-Droste coordinates perceive the boundary of the collapsing star as taking an infinite coordinate time to reach the horizon. We emphasize that Schwarzschild-Droste observers are static with respect to the center of mass of the star and therefore cannot be in free fall. The use of these coordinates implicitly requires the presence of a force that compensates the gravitational attraction. From this viewpoint, the apparent infinite-time collapse is not a physical effect but a coordinate artifact associated with non-inertial observers.",

      "abstract": "A Space-Time Fluid (Unabridged) Albert Stebbins General Physics (physics.gen-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Purpose: This essay is a retelling of general relativity in a language in which space-time geometry is expressed as a fluid. This trivial and useful reformulation gives 1) a non-perturbative covariant description of cosmological inhomogeneities and 2) a simple formula describing how cosmic inhomogeneities are generated on super-horizon scales. Methods: Equating the Ricci curvature with the associated matter stress-energy gives a description of space-time geometry in terms of fluid properties. These locally measurable (covariant) non-perturbative quantities are in some ways superior to commonly used \"gauge invariant\" quantities. The dynamics of a quantity (kurvature) which describes cosmological inhomogeneities is described in detail. A detailed comparison is made of space-time fluid dynamics with that of a classical (Newtonian physics) fluid. Results: The fluid lexicon permits an unambiguous definition of the velocity of space-time. The evolution of the space-time fluid is in many ways identical with that of the classical fluid when expressed in Lagrangian coordinates. Kurvature is a measure of the specific binding energy of the fluid and is a most useful covariant measure of cosmological inhomogeneities. For plausible matter models kurvature will increase, even on super-horizon scales, due to non-linear hydrodynamic effects rather than gravity. This phenomena is also exhibited by classical fluids. Conclusion: The space-time fluid representation of geometrodynamics gives a simple and useful description of the evolution of cosmological inhomogeneities.",

We validate this design strategy by fabricating and characterizing two distinct ternary systems: a SiNx -based proof-of-concept and a Ti:GeO2 -based system targeting lower optical losses. The performance of the SiN x coating shows remarkable agreement with predictions, demonstrating a noise amplitude spectral density reduction of 0.82 with respect to current reference coatings, and validating our design-to-fabrication pipeline. The Ti:GeO2 -based system achieves the crucial goal of sub-ppm absorption; its measured thermal noise, however, is higher than the theoretically predicted level of 0.71, extrapolated from single-layer material characterization. A dedicated tolerance analysis confirms that this discrepancy is not attributable to random thickness errors, emphasizing that further studies of the manufacturing process are needed to fully exploit this combination of materials.

The line element field provides MGR with the extra freedom required to describe dark energy and dark matter. An extended Schwarzschild solution for the matter-free Einstein equation of MGR is developed, from which the Tully-Fisher relation is derived, and the gravitational energy density is calculated. The mass of the invisible matter halo of galaxy NGC 3198 calculated with MGR is identical to the result obtained from GR using a dark matter profile. Although dark matter in MGR is described geometrically, it has an equivalent representation as a particle with the property of a vector boson or a pair of fermions; the geometry of spacetime and the quantum nature of matter are linked together by the unit line element covectors that belong to both the Lorentzian metric and the spin-1 Klein-Gordon wave equation. The three classic tests of GR provide a comparison of the theories in the solar system and several parts of the cosmos. MGR provides the flexibility to describe inflation after the Big Bang and galactic anisotropies.",

We develop a prescription to express the evolving eccentricity in terms of reference eccentricity and frequency. For that purpose we considered the spins to be perpendicular to the orbital plane. Using this we found an analytical result for the contribution of spin in eccentricity evolution. As a result, we expressed orbital eccentricity in a series of reference eccentricity and gravitational wave frequency. The prescription developed here can easily be used to find arbitrarily higher-order contributions of reference eccentricity. With this we computed the eccentricity upto $\\mathcal{O}(e_0^5)$. This result can be used to construct the waveforms of spinning compact objects in an eccentric orbit. Since, our expression depends on the spin induced quadrupole moments, we also study the impact of component properties on the eccentricity evolution through the quadrupole moment. We find for BNSs the evolution depends on the equation of state very mildly unless the NSs are subsolar mass. For subsolar mass NSs the deviations from BH case is comparatively larger and has equation of state dependence. For binary boson stars the deviations are comparatively larger across the mass values. We argue that it may affect our understanding of formation channels and their corresponding populations. We also argue that this can possibly be used as another tool to constrain exoticness of compact objects in a binary.",

      "abstract": "Short-distance thermal phase structure of charged black holes in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity Syed Masood General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Glavan and Lin's proposal of an effective four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4D-EGB) gravity framework yields predictions that differ from general relativity in some regimes. A range of black hole studies have offered insights into the dynamical and phenomenological aspects of this effective theory of gravity. In this work, we study thermodynamics of a charged 4D-EGB black hole with Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupling $\\alpha$, characterized by mass $M$ and charge $Q$ in the non-extremal regime $M>\\sqrt{Q^2+\\alpha}$ by combining a non-perturbative, quantum-gravity-inspired exponential correction to the entropy (quantified by $\\eta$) with information-geometric diagnostics. Working in a canonical ensemble (fixed $Q$) paradigm, we identify thermodynamic stability regions and phase-transition-like features as the black hole size tends toward extremality due to Hawking evaporation. We then construct the Ruppeiner metric on the $(M,Q)$ state space and evaluate the associated thermodynamic curvature to characterize the effective interaction signatures and its relation to critical behavior. In addition, an effective quantum-work quantity, defined from the free-energy landscape using Jarzynski equality, is evaluated as an additional probe of short-distance, near-extremal behavior. The results indicate that departures from the general-relativistic behavior are negligible for large black holes but can become relevant at small horizon scales. Specifically, on short-distance scales, the combined influence of $\\alpha$ and $\\eta$ can modify stability of the extremal black hole geometry and remnants within this thermodynamic model.",

The research focuses on enhancing gravitational-wave signal searches through the development of new tools and the application of existing methodologies to increase the sensitivity of live gravitational-wave searches. We introduced a novel noise artefact model, which enabled the identification and removal of glitches, thereby facilitating the recovery of previously missed gravitational-wave injections. This pioneering approach established a glitch search pipeline that adapted techniques typically used in gravitational-wave searches to address the unique characteristics of glitches. Additionally, we implemented an exponential noise model within the PyCBC Live search framework, significantly improving the detection ranking statistics for gravitational-wave signals and demonstrating the potential for substantial increases in detection sensitivity. Furthermore, we analysed and proposed enhancements for the PyCBC Live Early Warning search to maximise the detection of gravitational-wave events in the early warning regime. Our findings highlighted deficiencies in the current ranking statistic and led to recommendations for optimising coincidence timing windows and refining phase-time-amplitude histograms. These adjustments aim to increase the detection of gravitational-wave signals, particularly binary neutron star events, in early warning scenarios. The results underscore the importance of advancing search techniques in gravitational-wave astronomy, which can operate independently of detector improvements. By refining search methodologies, we enhance the capacity to detect a greater number of events, contributing significantly to our understanding of the Universe.",

Ghosh journal = \"JCAP\", volume = \"01\", pages = \"018\", year = \"2026\" General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate the shadow of Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black holes (KBRBHs), which have a deviation parameter $B$ that captures the effect of an external magnetic field on the spacetime geometry. These spacetimes of Petrov type $D$ are asymptotically non-flat. We utilise the separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation to generate null geodesics and examine the crucial impact parameters for unstable photon orbits that define the black hole shadow. We carefully investigate how the magnetic field strength $B$ and spin parameter $a$ influence black hole shadows, discovering that increasing $B$ increases the shadow size while also introducing additional distortions, especially at high spins. We calculate the shadow observables, viz., area $A$ and oblateness $D$ and create contour plots in the parameter space $(a, B)$ to facilitate parameter estimation. We also investigate the dependence of the shadow on the observer's position, specifically by altering the radial coordinate $r_O$ and the inclination angle $\\theta$. For far viewers, the shadow approaches its asymptotic shape, but finite-distance observers perceive substantial deviations. The energy emission rate analysis reveals that the magnetic field parameter $B$ modifies the Hawking radiation spectrum, with increasing $B$ suppressing emission via backreaction, which lowers the Hawking temperature. Our findings confirm that KBRBH shadows encode imprints of magnetic deviations, thereby offering a potential avenue to distinguish Kerr from non-Kerr spacetimes and to probe magnetic effects in the strong-gravity regime.",

Ghosh Matched with the published version General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate strong gravitational lensing using magnetized Kerr black holes (MKBHs), which are accurate Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson solutions for Kerr black holes in a uniform magnetic field with additional magnetic field strength $B$ apart from mass $M$ and spin $a$. Unlike previous magnetized spacetimes, the MKBH geometry is Petrov type D, devoid of conical singularities, allowing photons to reach asymptotic infinity and making the concept astrophysically feasible. We use the strong deflection limit formalism to calculate the photon sphere radius, critical impact parameter, deflection angle, and lensing observables including the image position $\\theta_\\infty$, angular separation $s$ and relative magnification $r_{\\text{mag}}$, as well as their relationships with the parameters $a$ and $B$. Our results reveal that the relativistic image's photon sphere and angular size increase with $B$, whereas lensing observables deviate significantly from the Kerr scenario. For M87*, with $a=0.9$, the angular position of relativistic images increases from $10.8~\\mu$as (Kerr) to $12.02~\\mu$as, and the time delay between the first two images increases from $158.5$ h to $176$ h at $B=0.4$. Similarly, for Sgr A*, the image position increases from $14.4~\\mu$as to $16~\\mu$as, with time delays enhanced by approximately $0.7$ minutes. The relative magnification $r_{\\text{mag}}$ grows with $B$ and deviates by $0.53$ from Kerr black holes at $B=0.4$. Our findings highlight strong gravitational lensing as a powerful tool to probe the presence of magnetic fields around astrophysical black holes, and in particular, we demonstrate that the MKBH spacetime enables constraints on the parameters $a$ and $B$.",

Tee 21 pages, text improved, MCMC analysis added, 2 tables, 2 figures General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) In the momentarily comoving frame of a cosmological fluid, the determinant of the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) is highly sensitive to its pressure. This component is significant during radiation-dominated epochs and becomes naturally negligible as the universe transitions to the matter-dominated era. Here, we investigate the cosmological consequences of gravity sourced by the determinant of the EMT. Unlike Azri and Nasri, Phys. Lett. B 836, 137626 (2023), we consider the most general scenario in which the second order variation of the perfect-fluid Lagrangian does not vanish. We analyze the dynamics of the power-law case and explore the cosmological implications of the scale-free model characterized by dimensionless couplings to photons and neutrinos. We show that, unlike various theories based on the EMT, the present setup, which leads to enhanced gravitational effects of radiation (EGER), does not alter the time evolution of the energy density of particle species. Using current cosmological observations, we constrain the model parameters and show that EGER may offer a viable mechanism for alleviating the Hubble tension. Although it exhibits a phenomenological analogy to tightly-coupled relativistic fluid scenarios, EGER remains purely gravitational in origin and yields distinguishable signatures in the small-scale anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background. The radiation-gravity couplings we propose here are expected to yield testable cosmological and astrophysical signatures, probing whether gravity distinguishes between relativistic and nonrelativistic species in the early universe.",

Two distinct scenarios are analyzed: (i) the quantum memories (held by Bob and Charlie) are near the horizon while the measured particle (Alice) remains in the flat region, and (ii) the reverse configuration. Dimensional dependence is observed: in $d>5$ dimensions, the measurement uncertainty decreases monotonically with increasing horizon radius, while coherence increases; in $d=5$, both quantities exhibit non-monotonic behavior due to distinctive thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, comparative analysis reveals that the W state exhibits higher robustness in preserving coherence, whereas the GHZ state shows greater resistance to measurement uncertainty increase induced by Hawking radiation. Notably, the two scenarios yield qualitatively distinct behaviors: quantum coherence is consistently lower in Scenario 1 (quantum memory near horizon) than in Scenario 2 (measured particle near horizon), irrespective of the quantum state. For measurement uncertainty, the W state displays lower uncertainty in Scenario 1, while the GHZ state exhibits the opposite trend, with higher measurement uncertainty in Scenario 1.

      "abstract": "Misinterpreting Spin Precession as Orbital Eccentricity in Gravitational-Wave Signals Snehal Tibrewal, Aaron Zimmerman, Jacob Lange, Deirdre Shoemaker General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The increasing scope and breadth of gravitational wave detectors is providing the opportunity to explore new parameters in gravitational-wave astronomy. Eccentricity and spin-precession are two key observables to infer the origin of a gravitational wave (GW) source. The interpretation of GW source parameters can be plagued by degeneracy, such as the well-known degeneracy between mass and spin. As the field has explored new parameters, questions have been raised about possible degeneracies between eccentricity and spin-precession. Although some state-of-the-art models now include these effects individually, models that incorporate spin-precession and eccentricity are only in their infancy. Until models faithfully cover the complete parameter space of compact binary coalescence, our ability to correctly measure the source parameters and infer the formation of the binary is compromised. Here, we present a study of the distinguishability of these two key parameters. Our work finds that there is indeed a degeneracy between eccentricity and spin-precession; however, it is a highly localized effect. We find that the misidentified eccentricity estimates get worse as the signal gets shorter. Additionally, this misidentification is highly sensitive to the inclination angle of the source system. We provide quantifiable estimates of the potency of this degeneracy in addition to identifying some of the regions of parameter space where this degeneracy exists.",

      "abstract": "Could black hole thermodynamics play a role in black hole mergers? George Ruppeiner General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers yield values for both the black hole remnant mass $M$ and it's spin $a$, with the $169$ $a$ values collected so far crowding significantly around their average $\\bar{a}=0.6869\\pm 0.087$. Could this crowding relate directly to the Davies phase transition point at $a=0.68125$ from black hole thermodynamics? I argue that a necessary challenge for such a connection requires a consistent application of the thermodynamic fluctuation theory that follows from black hole thermodynamics (BHT). Specifically, necessary are a correct choice of fluctuating variables, as well as thermal equilibrium between the event horizon at the Hawking temperature $\\sim \\mu K$ and the outside universe $\\sim 3 K$. I show that the former requirement follows in straightforward fashion from the BHT of the Kerr model, while the later requires an accretion disk following the Novikov-Thorne accretion disk model. I construct a thermodynamic fluctuation theory meeting both these requirements. My results open the possibility that black hole mergers are based on some dynamical model (not known to me) with a limiting attractor state at the Davies point.",

We investigate the superradiant instability of scalar clouds around Kerr black holes, showing that stimulated decay generates detectable electromagnetic signals. The growth of the superradiant scalar cloud differs from that of other bosonic fields and depends sensitively on the matter distribution surrounding the black hole, which originates from the scalar-matter coupling realized by the chameleon mechanism in modified gravity theories. In non-uniform matter distributions, stimulated emission from scalar clouds offers an observational signature that distinguishes fundamental scalars from other light bosonic fields.",

Comments are welcome General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The Galactic Center black hole environment gives us new opportunity to test deviation from General Relativity and black hole physics. In this work we analytically generate the shape of the Galactic Center black hole by using a recently developed exact stationary, axisymmetric and vacuum solution of $f(R)$ gravity theory. By using scalaron mass as a free parameter we find that the shadow shape along with displacement and asymmetry is sensitive to the scalaron mass, even after keeping the black hole spin low. We recognize scalaron mass which is compatible with Kerr like quadrupole moment and hence black hole \"no-hair\" theorem. The same mass scale is found to reproduce the PPN parameter ($\\gamma$) constrained in the weak field limit of the solar system. Gravitational identifiers, the Kretschmann scalar ($\\kappa$) and gravitational potential ($\\phi$) have been used to infer scalaron masses in the regime of S-stars which are found to be consistent with the limits obtained using shadow scales. We ensure that $f(R)$ gravity scalaron has an appropriate general relativistic limit in the horizon scale of the black hole. We also identify the possibility of scale invariance of the general relativistic limit.",
