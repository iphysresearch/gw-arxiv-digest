Wong, Francesco Cireddu, Milan Wils, Tom Colemont, Harsh Narola, Chris Van Den Broeck, Tjonnie G. F. Li General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We introduce a Bayesian null-stream method to constrain calibration errors in closed-geometry gravitational-wave (GW) detector networks. Unlike prior methods requiring electromagnetic counterparts or waveform models, this method uses sky-independent null streams to calibrate the detectors with any GW signals, independent of general relativity or waveform assumptions. We show a proof-of-concept study to demonstrate the feasibility of the method. We discuss prospects for next-generation detectors like Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, and LISA, where enhanced calibration accuracy will advance low-frequency GW science.",

Sänger, Alessandra Buonanno, Jan Steinhoff, Nicola Tamanini General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observations of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) will provide long duration inspiral signals with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data, ideal for testing general relativity (GR) in the strong-field and high-velocity regime. We present an extension of the Flexible Theory-Independent (FTI) framework, adapted to gravitational waves (GWs) from MBHBs observed with LISA, to perform parametrized inspiral tests of GR. This approach introduces generic deviations to the post-Newtonian (PN) coefficients of the frequency-domain GW phase while accounting for the time- and frequency-dependent instrument response, thus effectively identifying potential deviations from GR by constraining modifications to the PN phasing formula. Complementary analyses using Fisher matrix and full Bayesian approaches confirm that LISA observations could improve constraints on deviations from GR by at least two orders of magnitude compared to the most recent LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA measurements. Since LISA`s sensitivity to different GW phases -- inspiral, merger, and ringdown -- varies across the MBHB parameter space with masses between $10^4$ and $10^7M_{\\odot}$, the optimal regime for testing deviations is not known a priori. Our results illustrate how the strength of these constraints depends significantly on both the total mass and the SNR, reflecting the trade-off between inspiral and merger-ringdown contributions to the observed signal. We also investigate the interplay between inspiral-only versus inspiral-merger-ringdown analyses in constraining these inspiral deviation parameters. This work contributes to the development of robust tests of GR with LISA, enhancing our ability to probe the nature of gravity and BHs with GW observations.",

Sabido General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In previous works, entropic gravity and ungravity have been considered as possible solutions to the dark energy and dark matter problems. To test the viability of these models, modifications to planetary orbits are calculated for ungravity and different models of entropic gravity. Using the gravitational sector of unparticles, an equation for the contribution to the effect of orbital precession is obtained. We conclude that the estimated values for the ungravity parameters from planetary orbits are inconsistent with the values needed for the cosmological constant. The same ideas are explored for entropic gravity arising from a modified entropy--area relationship.",

The waveforms produced by these simulations have a number of applications in gravitational-wave detection and inference. In this work, we revisit the accuracy of the waveforms produced by the Spectral Einstein Code. Motivated by the wide range of waveform applications, we propose and explore three accuracy metrics between simulation resolutions: (i) the generalized frequency-weighted mismatch, (ii) the relative amplitude difference, and (iii) the phase difference at different times. We find that numerical errors accumulate over the binary evolution, but the error is not intrinsically larger during the latest, more dynamical stages. Studying errors across the parameter space, we identify a positive correlation between both the mismatch and the phase difference with precessing spin, but little correlation with aligned spin or eccentricity. Lastly, amplitude and phases differences are symmetric upon exchanging resolutions across the catalog, suggesting that there is no systematic error.",

Soon to be submitted to PRD for publication. All codes to generate the plots have been released as open source General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate the impact of missing input data on the construction of second-generation Time Delay Interferometry (TDI) variables, which enable data analysis for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). TDI relies on the introduction of precise time delays into the raw interferometric data streams before they are combined to suppress otherwise dominant laser phase noise. We show that a single missing sample, corresponding to 0.25 s of data, will result in an effective data gap of approximately 90 s in the second-generation TDI output if further measures are not taken. This additional gap is largely independent of the initial gap duration, but increases linearly with the order of the fractional-delay filter used for the computations. For a realistic gap scenario, incorporating both planned and unplanned data interruptions consistent with a target duty cycle of ~84%, we find that frequent, short-duration gaps (e.g., a total of 1000 per year, each of which have short durations ~ 100 s) could result in an additional loss in the TDI variables of about one day per year corresponding to a ~0.3% reduction in duty cycle. This amounts to a loss of approximately one day of LISA data suitable for the global-fit per year.",

The geodesic equations for the BF family are thus completely integrable by separation of variables. Within this broad class, we explore the Kerr-Schild transformation of a degenerate subclass distinguished by the existence of a shear-free null geodesic congruence. By requiring the deformed metric to preserve the Killing symmetry and circularity, we demonstrate that the deformed metric again falls into the degenerate BF family, modulo the replacement of a single structure function. We apply the present algorithm to ${\\cal N}=2$ gauged supergravity and obtain a dyonic generalization of the Chong-Cvetič-Lü-Pope rotating black hole solution, by taking the background metric to be a solution of the Einstein-scalar gravity. The present prescription extends to five dimensions, provided that the constant of geodesic motion associated with the extra Killing direction vanishes. The same reasoning applies to the case where the background degenerate BF metric is distorted in a (non)conformal manner. Our formalism offers a unified perspective on the relation between seed and deformed metrics in the Kerr-Schild construction.",

Starting from the Hamiltonian formulation, we derive the polymer-deformed equations of motion and analyze their solutions for the contracting branch of the model. In contrast with the undeformed classical dynamics, the exponential deformation with suitable values of deformation parameters, produces a noticeably slower evolution of the volume variable and leads to a stabilization of the anisotropy parameters, which remain bounded throughout the evolution. No removal of the initial singularity is observed; however, the deformation significantly modifies the asymptotic behavior, offering a mechanism to suppress anisotropic shear near the singularity. Our results are illustrated through analytic solutions, highlighting the qualitative differences between the standard and the polymer--deformed Bianchi~I cosmology.",

The analysis is performed in both the time and frequency domains. We find that increasing the mass of the field leads to a strong suppression of the damping rate, and extrapolation to larger masses indicates the emergence of arbitrarily long-lived oscillations, or quasi-resonances. In the time domain, the late-time decay follows an asymptotic behavior that differs from the power-law tails of the classical Schwarzschild case. Furthermore, we compute the grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections for the massive scalar field and show that the grey-body factors decrease as the field mass increases, effectively shifting the emitted radiation spectrum toward higher frequencies.",

Chandramouli, Enrico Barausse General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Gravitational-wave signals are typically interpreted under the vacuum hypothesis, i.e. assuming negligible influence from the astrophysical environment. This assumption is expected to break down for low-frequency sources such as extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), which are prime targets for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and are expected to form, at least in part, in dense environments such as Active Galactic Nuclei or dark-matter spikes/cores. Modeling environmental effects parametrically is challenging due to the large uncertainties in their underlying physics. We propose a non-parametric test for environmental effects in EMRIs, based on assessing the self-consistency of vacuum parameter posteriors inferred from different portions of the signal. Our results demonstrate that this approach can reveal the presence of astrophysical environments, or even deviations from General Relativity, without introducing additional parameters or assumptions about the underlying physics.",

Anarya Ray, Sharan Banagiri, Eric Thrane General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The recently reported binary black hole merger, GW231123, has unusual properties that make it hard to explain astrophysically. Parameter estimation studies are consistent with maximally spinning black holes and the dimensionless spin of the more massive component is constrained to be $\\chi_1\\gtrsim 0.8$. Analysis of data also revealed potential systematics that could not be fully replicated with simulated studies. We explore the possibility that these measurements are biased due to unmodeled non-Gaussian noise in the detectors, and that the actual black hole spins are more modest. We present evidence for a population of \\textit{microglitches} in LIGO gravitational-wave strain data that can lead to biases in the parameter estimation of short-duration signals such as GW231123. Using simulated data of a massive event like GW231123, we demonstrate how microglitches can bias our measurements of black hole spins toward $\\chi\\approx1$ with negligible posterior support for the true value of $\\chi\\approx0.7$. We develop a noise model to account for microglitches and show that this model successfully reduces biases in the recovery of signal parameters. We characterize the microglitch population in real interferometer data surrounding GW231123 and find a single detector glitch duty cycle of $0.57_{-0.19}^{+0.21}$, which implies nearly a $100\\%$ probability that at least one event through the fourth gravitational wave transient catalog coincides with microglitches in two detectors. We argue that further investigations are required before we can have a confident picture of the astrophysical properties of GW231123.",

We consider two toy constructions: ($i$) a fractional modification of the linearized Einstein field equations using a sequential Caputo operator, and ($ii$) a fractionalized quadrupole formula where the source moment is acted upon by the same operator. Both constructions yield history-dependent responses with small memory-like offsets. However, in all cases, the signal decays to zero at late times, failing to reproduce the permanent displacement predicted by GR. Our results, therefore, constitute a no-go demonstration: naive fractionalization is insufficient to model nonlinear gravitational memory. We argue that any successful model must incorporate fractional kernels directly into the hereditary flux-balance integral of General Relativity, while preserving gauge invariance and dimensional consistency.

      "abstract": "Gauge Dependence of Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves from Isocurvature Perturbations: Analytical Results Arshad Ali, Yang Lei, Mudassar Sabir General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We analytically study the gauge dependence of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) sourced by primordial isocurvature perturbations during radiation domination (RD), working across nine gauges. Through analytical integrations of the kernels supported by graphical comparison we identify a clear dichotomy. We find that in some gauges viz. the uniform-density (UD), total-matter (TM), uniform-curvature (UC), comoving-orthogonal (CO) and transverse-traceless (TT) gauges the energy density grows polynomially in conformal time $\\eta^n$, where $n$ varies from $2$ to $8$. While in rest of the gauges viz. the longitudinal (Long.), uniform-expansion (UE), Newtonian-motion (Nm), and N-body (Nb) gauges the late-time energy spectrum converges, and SIGWs behave as radiation. For subhorizon modes ($ k\\eta \\gg 1 $), the divergence becomes severe, showing that SIGWs are gauge-dependent observables in this regime. We resolve it through a kernel projection that isolates the luminal, freely propagating gravitational wave components (oscillating as $\\sin(k\\eta)$ and $\\cos(k\\eta)$), eliminating spurious contributions. The resulting kernel decays as $ (k\\eta)^{-1} $ and yields a finite, gauge-independent late-time spectrum, confirming that only luminal modes represent physical SIGWs.",

      "abstract": "Modified Fronsdal coordinates for maximally extended Schwarzschild spacetime Andrei Galiautdinov General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We introduce a coordinate system that complements the Kruskal--Szekeres extension. Like the standard construction, it covers the maximally extended Schwarzschild manifold in its entirety, while offering an additional advantage of expressing the areal radius as an explicit function of the new coordinates. Its main limitation, however, is that radial null geodesics are no longer represented as 45-degree lines in the Kruskal plane, making the causal structure more difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, the new system offers a compelling aesthetic trade-off: among all known maximally extended systems - including those of Kruskal-Szekeres, Israel, Fronsdal, Novikov, and Synge - it exhibits the highest degree of symmetry with respect to Schwarzschild's original r- and t-coordinate lines. It trades the regular pattern of Kruskal's light cones for a symmetric nesting arrangement of the two-dimensional spheres. The proposed extension sheds new light on the closely related Fronsdal's six-dimensional embedding construction, and clarifies the deep connection that exists between the most important implicit (Kruskal-Szekeres) and explicit (Israel's) procedures for maximal extension of the Schwarzschild geometry that is well known to those working in the field but rarely presented in textbooks on general relativity.",

In this work, we explore a topological supergravity action that initially describes a universe without Riemann curvature, which seems trivial. However, we made a surprising discovery by introducing a small deformation parameter $\\lambda$, which can be regarded as an AdS generalization of supersymmetry (SUSY). We find that the deformed topological quantum field theory (TQFT) becomes unstable at low energy, resulting in the emergence of a classical metric, whose dynamics are controlled by the Einstein equation.

In this work, considering various scenarios admitting (either fundamental or effective) massive scalar and gravitational fields, we demonstrate that bump deformations in the effective potential, either in the near-horizon or far-field regions, modify these asymptotic oscillatory tails. Specifically, the power-law envelope transitions to a more complex oscillatory pattern, which cannot be easily fitted to a simple formula. This behavior is qualitatively different from the echoes of massless fields, which appear mainly during the quasinormal ringing stage and are considerably suppressed at the asymptotic tails.

This article provides a comprehensive summary and comparative analysis of the various theoretical branches of torsional gravity and non-metric gravity, which arise from different choices of affine connection. We identify two types of background-dependent and classical correspondences between these two theories of gravity. The first correspondence is established through their equivalence within the Minkowski spacetime background. To achieve this, we develop the tetrad-spin formulation of $f(Q)$ gravity and derive the corresponding expression for the spin connection. The second correspondence is based on the equivalence of their equations of motion. Utilizing a metric-affine approach, we derive the general affine connection for static and spherically symmetric spacetime in $f(Q)$ gravity and compare its equations of motion with those of $f(T)$ gravity. Among others, our results reveal that, $f(T)$ solutions are not simply a subset of $f(Q)$ solutions; rather, they encompass a complex solution beyond $f(Q)$ gravity in black hole background.",

However, including a negative cosmological constant in PL gravity leads to a curvature singularity \\cite{Cai:2006pq}. Here, we choose the coupling constants such that the Lovelock equations admit an $n$-fold degenerate AdS vacuum (LnFDGS), allowing us to construct an RBH with $\\Lambda < 0$, where the energy density is analogous to the previously mentioned model. To achieve this, we propose alternative definitions for both the KS and GT. We find that, for mass parameter values greater than the extremal value $M_{\\text{min}}$, our RBH solution becomes indistinguishable from the AdS vacuum black hole from inside the event horizon out to infinity. At small scales, quantum effects modify the geometry and thermodynamics, removing the singularity. Furthermore, due to the lack of analytical relationships between the event horizon, photon sphere, and shadow in LnFDGS, we propose a numerical method to represent these quantities.",

This uses ideas of Wu and LeBrun. Hermitian non-Kähler Einstein 4-manifolds have a quasi-locally conserved charge, which is shown to correspond to a parameter of the moduli space.

By developing a scalar-tensor formulation with two auxiliary fields, we systematically investigate both the propagation and backreaction of high-frequency gravitational waves in cosmological backgrounds. Within this framework, we derive, for the first time, the complete effective energy-momentum tensor for GWs in $f(R, G)$ theory. The linearized field equations reveal how the Gauss-Bonnet term introduces new curvature-dependent couplings between tensor and scalar degrees of freedom, leading to modified dispersion relations and distinctive wave propagation effects. On de Sitter backgrounds, we obtain exact decoupled equations for the tensor and scalar modes, demonstrating how the additional $G$ dependence alters both the effective masses and energy transport mechanisms compared to the well-established framework of pure $f(R)$ theories. Our derivation of the effective energy-momentum tensor extends Isaacson's approach to incorporate the novel scalar field contributions, revealing a complex hierarchy of characteristic length scales ($\\lambda$, $\\ell$, and $\\mathcal{L}$) that govern the backreaction dynamics. The resulting formalism suggests potentially observable signatures in both the propagation (phase shifts, amplitude modulation) and stochastic background of gravitational waves. These effects could be probed by next-generation detectors, offering new constraints on the $f(R, G)$ coupling parameters. The theoretical framework developed here provides a foundation for future studies of gravitational wave generation in modified gravity scenarios and their role in the formation of cosmological structures.",

In this work, we develop a post-Newtonian (PN) framework to compute the Fourier amplitudes of GWs from the inspiral of eccentric binaries, deriving simple expressions at 1PN order for all relevant $(l, m)$ multipoles, valid for arbitrary eccentricities. We then characterize the GW emission by analyzing the contribution of each $(l, m)$ mode to the strain, its mean frequency, frequency spread, and asymptotic behavior at high frequencies. Additionally, we introduce a method to determine the minimal set of Fourier modes needed to reconstruct the waveform to a given accuracy. Finally, we discuss how our framework can be extended to higher PN orders, obtaining closed-form expressions for the leading-order tail and spin contributions and outlining the steps required to include higher-order corrections.

These are chains of non-gravitational interactions between quantum systems modeled via decoherence and test functions that obey conditions that aim to address the measurement problem and allow for a conservative theory of gravity. It is conservative because it does not need to modify the fundamental equations of quantum theory, unlike spontaneous and gravity-induced collapse approaches to semiclassical gravity, and without invoking relationalism. Furthermore, it does not appeal to nonlocal, retrocausal, or superdeterministic hidden variables. When systems do not interact with SDCs, they do not emit a gravitational field, and the expectation value of their stress-energy tensor does not enter the semiclassical equations describing the gravitational field in a region. In the absence of SDCs in a region, spacetime can be flat. This theory holds a version of the equivalence principle, which establishes that different bodies under the same gravitational field evolve similarly in the absence of non-gravitational interactions. It can be tested by experiments investigating the gravitational field emitted by quasi-isolated systems, and the lack of gravity-mediated entanglement and certain kinds of collapse in the Bose-Marletto-Vedral (BMV) experiment. It provides multiple benefits, such as a semiclassical estimation of the value of the cosmological constant and the prediction of a time-varying dark energy that weakens with time, in agreement with some evidence. More broadly, we propose a new testable framework in which there is a conditional emission of a gravitational field by quantum systems, which may undermine the main motivations for a theory of quantum gravity.",

Although emissions due to hydromagnetic deformations are more promising from a detection standpoint, exterior fields also contribute a strain. However, numerical evidence suggests that the free energy of stable magnetospheric solutions cannot exceed a few tens of percent relative to the potential state, implying that the magnetospheric contribution to the gravitational-wave luminosity cannot differ significantly between models. This prompts 'universality', in the sense that the strain provides a direct probe of the near-surface field without being muddied by magnetospheric currents.

We examine how the magnetic charge influences orbital dynamics by modifying the background spacetime geometry, thereby affecting the energy and angular momentum of particles. In particular, we calculate the radii of the marginally bound orbits (MBOs) and innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs), demonstrating that the magnetic charge parameter reduces both radii. This provides valuable insight into the role of the charge parameter in shaping orbital behavior and altering spacetime geometry. We model the complex motion of a stellar-mass object as a timelike particle, inspiraling into a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the MCBH background, with its trajectory described using periodic geodesic orbits. Based on this analysis of such periodic orbits, we further analyze the gravitational waveforms generated by extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which the SMBH's spacetime dominates the dynamics of the stellar-mass object. By combining particle trajectory analysis with waveform modeling in a semi-analytical approach, we show that the charge parameter significantly alters the zoom-whirl orbital dynamics and induces notable changes in the waveform structure. These results illustrate that future gravitational wave (GW) observations may constrain the properties of MCBHs, thereby deepening our understanding of the gravitational imprint of regular black holes.",

      "abstract": "Localized five-dimensional rotating brane-world black hole Analytically Connected to an to an AdS$_5$ boundary Milko Estrada, Francisco Tello-Ortiz General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We provide a method to describe the geometry of an analytic, exponentially localized $5D$ rotating braneworld black hole, using the $5D$ Janis Newman algorithm in Hopf coordinates. The induced metric on the brane matches the standard $4D$ Kerr spacetime. Two curvature singularities arise: one confined to the $3$-brane at $z = r = 0$, and another that, on the brane, reproduces the Kerr singularity at $r = 0$, $\\bar{\\theta} = \\pi/2$. The inner and event horizons, together with the stationary limit hypersurfaces, extend into the extra dimension in a pancake-like shape. We describe their behavior in the bulk. The energy momentum tensor represents a source transitioning from an anisotropic, non diagonal structure to a vacuum with negative cosmological constant. Thus, the localized black hole connects to an AdS$_5$ boundary. The geometry is supported by a non-diagonal anisotropic fluid in the bulk, requiring no matter on the brane. To evaluate the energy conditions, we use a one form from the dual basis that yields a diagonal energy momentum tensor.",

      "abstract": "Could regular primordial black holes be dark matter? Mohsen Khodadi 12 pages, 1 figure, to appear in PLB Phys. Lett. B 870 (2025) 139922 General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) The recent proposal proposed by Paul Davies and colleagues [Phys. Rev. D \\textbf{111} (2025) no.10, 103512] that regular primordial black holes (RPBHs) form stable, zero-temperature remnants and could thereby constitute dark matter is critically examined. While the introduction of a fundamental length scale indeed regulates the Hawking temperature, preventing its divergence, we show that the evaporation timescale for such RPBHs is infinite. This result holds generically for analytic regular black hole spacetimes under standard adiabatic and quasi-static evolution. Consequently, RPBHs never actually reach a true remnant state within any finite time, but instead persist as slowly evaporating objects with a non-zero luminosity. When the combined emission from a cosmological population of these near-remnants is considered, the resulting radiation is found to violate stringent observational constraints from the cosmic microwave background and extragalactic gamma-ray backgrounds. Therefore, low-mass RPBHs are not viable dark matter candidates.",

In KAGRA, cryogenic mirrors are held by thick suspension fibers, designed to sustain such a low-temperature environment, which may further affect inharmonicity modes, fiber dimensions, and mechanical behavior compared to typical interferometers. As these modes remain a prominent source of narrowband contamination, we implement a Kalman filter to model and track violin lines, building on the methodology introduced in [1], and apply subtraction to KAGRA O3GK data. Using gravitational-wave template injections, we validate that the subtraction preserves matched-filter SNR while effectively suppressing line power. Comparisons of power spectral densities and residual analyses confirm that the method removes deterministic line contributions without introducing waveform distortions. This approach provides a cleaner strain channel for searches and parameter estimation and will become increasingly important for future low-temperature detectors with higher-Q suspensions, such as the Einstein Telescope.",

In this work, we employ the Green's function method under the assumption of an observer at spatial infinity to obtain the waveform. For two cases in which the initial Gauss bump near the event horizon or at spatial infinity, we derive analytic expressions for the corresponding waveforms. Our results demonstrate that the waveform is indeed insensitive to tiny modifications of the effective potential, thereby confirming its stability. More importantly, we find that broader initial bumps imprint the influence of small environmental modifications more clearly on the waveform, which may provide theoretical guidance for probing the exterior environment of black holes.",
