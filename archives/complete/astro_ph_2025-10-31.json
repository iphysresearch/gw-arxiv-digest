It enables the observation of intermediate-mass black hole mergers, the issuance of early alerts for gravitational-wave events, and the exploration of the stochastic gravitational-wave background. The Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS) is a proposed gravitational-wave detector based on a Sagnac speed-meter topology that uses torsion bars as test masses. Its prototype design aims to achieve a strain sensitivity of $3 \\times 10^{-18}~\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1~Hz and thus enable the detection of $\\mathcal{O}(10^4),M_\\odot$ intermediate-mass black hole mergers at 100~Mpc with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. We show that the torsion-bar-based speed meter can suppress noise originating from laser intensity fluctuations by canceling the net torque on the bar and by using a balanced homodyne readout. We further present, for the first time, an analytic intensity-noise model for a gravitational-wave detector employing a torsion-bar Sagnac speed-meter configuration. Using this model, we evaluate the expected performance of a 2.5~m arm-length CHRONOS prototype. The projected laser-intensity noise is $2.9 \\times 10^{-20}~\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1~Hz, which is sufficiently low to allow the detection of binary intermediate-mass black hole mergers.",

Using ABCD-matrix analysis and Finesse3 simulations, we show that stable eigenmodes are obtained with optimized mirror curvatures and focal placements, achieving mode-matching efficiencies above 99.5 %.

The power-recycling cavity detuning ($\\phi_p=-85^{\\circ}$) dominates the low-frequency quantum noise, while the signal-recycling cavity detuning ($\\phi_s=0^{\\circ}$) mainly introduces a uniform quadrature rotation. The optimal homodyne angle ($\\zeta_{\\mathrm{opt}}\\simeq46^{\\circ}$) balances shot-noise and radiation-pressure effects to give the best sensitivity near 1 Hz.

The high-energy post-inflationary era may involve multiple distinct epochs, each characterized by a different equation of state (EoS). A key prediction of inflation is the generation of tensor perturbations that later manifest as a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The large-scale amplitude and small-scale spectral tilt ($n_{\\rm GW}$) of these GWs encode the inflationary energy scale and the subsequent expansion history, respectively. A soft post-inflationary EoS ($w<1/3$) yields red-tilted GW spectra ($n_{\\rm GW}<0$), while a stiff EoS ($w>1/3$) results in a blue-tilt ($n_{\\rm GW}>0$). In our previous work [arXiv:2407.07956], we developed an analytical framework for computing the GW spectral energy density, $\\Omega_{\\rm GW}(f)$, for multiple post-inflationary transitions ($w_1 \\to w_2 \\to \\cdots \\to w_n \\to 1/3$), focusing on the parameter space relevant for future GW observations. In this paper, we extend that framework to systematically investigate the $morphological~diversity$ of inflationary GW spectra generated by multi-epoch post-inflationary histories. Remaining model agnostic, we demonstrate that a wide variety of spectral shapes, ranging from convex and concave monotonic profiles to multi-peaked non-monotonic spectra, can naturally emerge depending on the sequence and duration of these epochs. We also introduce GWInSpect, a publicly available Python package that computes $\\Omega_{\\rm GW}(f)$ for arbitrary sequences of EoS transitions, providing a practical tool to study the pre-BBN expansion history of the Universe.",

Medeiros Silva 63 pages, no figures, prepared for submission to JCAP Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We develop a second-order cosmological perturbation theory on a background geometry expressed in terms of light-cone coordinates, extending the first-order analyses available in the literature. In particular, we investigate the gauge transformations of second-order perturbative quantities on the light-cone and establish their connection with standard perturbation theory. Through a consistent matching procedure, we identify the second-order gauge fixing that corresponds to the non-linear Geodesic Light-Cone gauge within standard perturbation theory, known as the Observational Synchronous Gauge. We then emphasize its conceptual similarities and differences wrt the standard Synchronous Gauge. Finally, within this new perturbative framework, and adopting a fully gauge-invariant approach, we compute the luminosity distance-redshift relation up to second order with anisotropic stress as seen by a free-falling observer. Remarkably, we show how divergences at the observer position can be eliminated in a completely model independent way. These results validate our perturbative framework and establish it as a novel formalism for evaluating cosmological observables at second order.",

Our study explores the geodesic structure, focusing on photon sphere properties, black hole shadows, and innermost stable circular orbits of test particles around these exotic geometries. The analysis reveals fundamental modifications to particle trajectories that distinguish quantum-corrected solutions from their classical counterparts, with observable implications for high-energy astrophysics. We investigate quasi-periodic oscillations arising from test particle motion, deriving frequency relationships that could serve as observational probes of quantum gravity effects in accreting black hole systems. Through rigorous gravitational lensing analysis using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we calculate weak-field deflection angles and identify distinctive signatures that enable discrimination between the two quantum correction models. The gravitational lensing study reveals opposite dependencies on quantum parameters between the models, providing unambiguous observational discriminants. Additionally, we analyze the thermodynamic properties including temperature, entropy, and heat capacity modifications, exploring topological characteristics and phase transition behavior in these quantum-corrected systems. The investigation reveals that the two models exhibit contrasting behaviors across multiple observational channels, from gravitational lensing deflection angles to quasi-periodic oscillation frequencies, providing remarkable discriminants for testing quantum gravity theories.",

Turyshev Optics (physics.optics); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det) High-precision corner-cube retroreflectors (CCRs) are critical for advanced lunar laser ranging (LLR) because they enable sub-millimeter-scale measurements of the Earth-Moon distance -- a level of precision essential for rigorous tests of relativistic gravitation and for advancing our understanding of lunar geophysics. In this work, we develop a comprehensive two-dimensional Fourier-optics model for single CCRs with apertures ranging from 80-110 mm. Our model incorporates realistic thermal-mechanical wavefront errors, detailed diffraction effects, and velocity aberration offsets. Our analysis reveals a strong coupling between aperture size and aberration angular offset: while larger CCRs deliver high on-axis flux under near-ideal conditions, their narrow diffraction lobes suffer significant flux loss at moderate aberration offsets, thereby favoring smaller apertures with broader main lobes. Furthermore, comparisons between solid fused-silica and hollow silicon-carbide (SiC) CCRs show that hollow designs not only achieve competitive or superior photon return -- particularly at 1064 nm, where phase errors are relatively reduced -- but also offer nearly an order-of-magnitude mass reduction for the same aperture sizes. These results establish a robust quantitative framework for optimizing CCR designs to perform at the sub-millimeter level under realistic lunar conditions and underscore the advantages of precision hollow SiC CCRs for next-generation LLR operations.",

Fromm 14 Pages, 9 Figures. Accepted by ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Observations of accreting black hole (BH) systems, such as microquasars and supermassive black holes, often reveal a precessing jet with changing directions, indicating a misaligned accretion flow relative to the BH spin. The precession is commonly attributed to the Lense-Thirring (LT) effect, which arises from the BH's rotation twisting the surrounding spacetime and accretion flow. In the strongly magnetized regime, which is preferred accretion flow conditions for M~87$^*$ and likely other jet-producing systems, the large-scale magnetic field can significantly influence the flow dynamics. Here, we perform large-scale three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of tilted accretion onto a rotating BH, and find a never-seen-before new retrograde precession. This precession arises from a magnetic torque on the disk generated by the poloidal magnetic field aligned with the BH's rotation, opposing the LT torque. This finding highlights the unique property of highly magnetized accretion flows around BHs and provides a new interpretation of jet precession observed in many systems.",

We present and apply a novel non-parametric framework for modeling multi-dimensional, correlated distributions based on Delaunay triangulation. Crucially, the complexity of the model -- namely, the number, positions, and weights of triangulation nodes -- is inferred directly from the data, resulting in a highly efficient approach that requires about one to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters and significantly less calibration than current state-of-the-art methods.

Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) This study of the M81 complex and its Hubble flow delivers new and improved Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB)-based distances for nine member galaxies, yielding a total of 58 galaxies with high-precision TRGB distances. With those, we perform a systematic analysis of the group's dynamics in the core and its embedding in the local cosmic environment. Our analysis confirms that the satellite galaxies of the M81 complex exhibit a flattened, planar distribution almost perpendicular to the supergalactic pole and thus aligned with a larger-scale filamentary structure in the Local Universe. We demonstrate that the properties of the group's barycentre are robustly constrained by the two brightest members, M81 and M82, and that correcting heliocentric velocities for the solar motion in the Local Group decreases the velocity dispersion of the group. Then applying minor and major infall models, we fit the local Hubble flow to constrain the Hubble Constant and the total mass of the M81 complex. The joint best-fit parameters from both models yield $H_0 = \\left(63 \\pm 6 \\right)$ km/s/Mpc and total mass of $(2.28\\pm 0.49) \\times 10^{12} M_{\\odot}$.

Fixing the spectral tilt and the baryons abundance, we measure $S_8=0.833\\pm 0.032$, $\\Omega_m = 0.272\\pm 0.022$, and $h = 0.773\\pm 0.049$, to about $3.8\\%$, $8.1\\%$, and $6.3\\%$, at $68\\%$CL, respectively.

A huge number of oscillon samples obtained from numerical lattice simulations reveal that the oscillon mass distribution has an exponential tail in a heavy-mass region. This enables us to infer the fractional abundance of heavy oscillons. Using the criterion for the primordial black hole (PBH) formation from the oscillon collapse obtained in previous studies, we estimate the abundance of PBHs and conclude that a sizable number of PBHs can be produced from oscillons. It can be an alternative PBH formation mechanism without employing the tuning of the inflaton potential to enhance the small-scale density fluctuations in the conventional PBH formation scenario.",

Here, we introduce a new method for determining $n(z)$ for weak lensing surveys based on high-quality redshifts and neural network-based importance weights. Additionally, we present the first unified photometric redshift calibration of the three leading stage-III weak lensing surveys, the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey and the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), with state-of-the-art spectroscopic data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We verify our method using a new, data-driven approach and obtain $n(z)$ constraints with statistical uncertainties of order $\\sigma_{\\bar z} \\sim 0.01$ and smaller. Our analysis is largely independent of previous photometric redshift calibrations and, thus, provides an important cross-check in light of recent cosmological tensions. Overall, we find excellent agreement with previously published results on the DES Y3 and HSC Y1 data sets while there are some differences on the mean redshift with respect to the previously published KiDS-1000 results. We attribute the latter to mismatches in photometric noise properties in the COSMOS field compared to the wider KiDS SOM-gold catalog. At the same time, the new $n(z)$ estimates for KiDS do not significantly change estimates of cosmic structure growth from cosmic shear. Finally, we discuss how our method can be applied to future weak lensing calibrations with DESI data.",

Such birefringence induces a nonzero cross-correlation between the CMB $E$- and $B$-modes, providing a direct observational signature of parity violation. Recent measurements of the $EB$ and $TB$ power spectra, however, cannot yet unambiguously separate instrumental miscalibration ($\\alpha$) from a true cosmic-rotation angle ($\\beta$). For this reason, we perform a model-independent analysis in terms of the total effective rotation angle $\\alpha+\\beta$. We analyze the latest $EB$ and $TB$ measurements from the SPIDER, Planck, and ACT experiments and derive constraints on the Chern-Simons coupling constant $gM_{Pl}$ and on the polarization rotation angle $\\alpha+\\beta$. We find that the coupling $gM_{Pl}$ is not compatible with the SPIDER data, while it provides reasonable fits to the Planck and ACT measurements. The fits for $\\alpha+\\beta$ prefer a value larger than zero: when combined, Planck+ACT yield a detection significance of approximately 7$\\sigma$. We also find that ACT data alone do not provide sufficiently tight constraints on either $gM_{Pl}$ or $\\alpha+\\beta$, whereas the combination Planck+ACT improves the statistical consistency of ACT's high-$\\ell$ results and leads to a better PTE for those measurements.",

Mingarelli Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Pulsar Timing Array experiments are rapidly approaching the era of gravitational wave background anisotropy detection. The timing residuals of each pulsar are an integrated measure of the gravitational-wave power across all angular scales. However, due to the limited number of monitored pulsars, current analyses are only able to reconstruct the angular structure of the background at large scales. We show analytically that this mismatch between the integrated all-sky signal and the truncated reconstruction introduces a previously unaccounted source of systematic bias in anisotropic background map reconstruction. The source of this systematic error, that we call ''small-scale leakage'', is the intrinsic presence of unaccounted gravitational wave power at scales smaller than the reconstructed scales. This unmodeled power leaks into large-scale modes, artificially increasing the recovered value of the inferred angular power spectrum by at least one order of magnitude in a wide range of scales. Importantly, this effect is fundamentally independent of the geometry of the pulsar configuration, the anisotropy reconstruction method, the use of different regularization schemes, and the presence of pulsar noise. As the quality of pulsar timing array experiments improves, a robust understanding of small-scale leakage will become paramount for reliable detection and characterization of the gravitational wave background. Thus, the theoretical formalism developed here will be essential to estimate the magnitude of this systematic uncertainty in anisotropy searches.",

      "abstract": "A cross-bispectrum estimator for CMB-HI intensity mapping correlations Kavilan Moodley, Warren Naidoo, Heather Prince, Aurelie Penin Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Intensity mapping of 21cm emission from neutral hydrogen promises to be a powerful probe of large-scale structure in the post-reionisation epoch. However, HI intensity mapping (IM) experiments will suffer the loss of long-wavelength line-of-sight HI modes in the foreground subtraction process. This significantly reduces HI IM cross-correlations with projected large-scale structure tracers, such as CMB secondary anisotropies. Here we propose a cross-bispectrum estimator, $B^{\\bar \\kappa \\delta T_{21} \\delta T_{21}},$ to recover the cross-correlation of the HI IM field, $\\delta T_{21},$ with the CMB lensing field, $\\kappa,$ constructed by correlating the position-dependent HI power spectrum with the mean overdensity traced by CMB lensing. We study the cross-bispectrum estimator in the squeezed limit and forecast its detectability based on HI IM measurements from HIRAX and CMB lensing measurements from Advanced ACT. We find that $B^{\\bar \\kappa \\delta T_{21}\\delta T_{21}},$ in combination with the HI IM and CMB lensing auto-spectra, can place sub-percent constraints on the growth rate of fluctuations, $f,$ and the small scale amplitude of fluctuations, $ \\sigma_8.$ The cross-bispectrum, in combination with the auto-spectra and Planck priors, improves dark energy constraints to 0.025 on $w_0$ and 0.11 on $w_a$ for flat models. These results are robust to HI foreground removal because they derive from small-scale HI modes. The HI-CMB lensing cross-bispectrum thus provides a novel way to recover HI correlations with CMB lensing and constrain cosmological parameters at a level that is competitive with next-generation galaxy redshift surveys. As a striking example of this, we find a tight constraint of 27.8 meV (29.0 meV) on the sum of neutrino masses, while varying all redshift and standard cosmological parameters within a flat $\\Lambda$CDM ($w_0w_a$CDM) model.",

Stiavelli Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Gravitational time delays offer unique, independent measurements of the Hubble constant, $H_0$. Precise measurements of $H_0$ stand as one of the most pressing challenges in modern cosmology, and to do so with time delays requires precise lens models. While much work has focused on streamlining the modeling process to keep pace with the erumpent discovery of strongly-lensed systems, a critical step toward reducing uncertainty in $H_0$ comes from increasing the precision of individual lens models themselves. In this work, we demonstrate that the unprecedented imaging capabilities of JWST make this goal attainable. We present the first lens model for time-delay cosmography derived from JWST data, applied to the quadruply-imaged quasar WFI2033--4723. While the primary source of systematic uncertainty in time-delay cosmography is currently the mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD), the sensitivity of models to this MSD varies on how the point spread function (PSF) errors are mitigated. As the PSF is also the primary source of uncertainty in lens modeling, we focus on a comparison of different PSF modeling methods. Within the context of power-law models, we recover results in agreement with previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST)-based models, but with better precision of key lensing parameters through implementation of new PSF modeling techniques. Despite the record-holding precision of this system's HST modeling, we achieve an additional 22% increase in precision of the Fermat potential difference, directly reducing uncertainties of cosmological inference. These results would produce a 3% ($1\\sigma$ of the modeling error) shift of $H_0$ towards a higher value for this lens, keeping all else constant. This work substantiates the groundbreaking potential of JWST for time-delay cosmography and lays the groundwork for modeling systems previously too faint to provide meaningful constraints on $H_0$.",

We compare LambdaCDM, wCDM, and w_0w_aCDM models to evaluate how the choice of data basis and the width of the prior on w_a affect dark-energy inference. Ratio-only fits (D_M/D_H) amplify the (w_0, w_a) degeneracy and can produce large apparent shifts in point estimates without genuine evidence for dynamical dark energy. Joint fits using (D_V/r_d, D_M/D_H) restore parameter consistency and show that these shifts mainly trace the degeneracy ridge. The pivoted equation of state, w_p = w(a_p) \\simeq -0.9 \\pm 0.1 at z_p \\simeq 0.34, remains stable and consistent with a cosmological constant within 1sigma. Model-selection diagnostics (AIC, BIC, and Bayes factors) provide only moderate support for LambdaCDM, indicating no significant evidence for an evolving w(a).

Lovell, Tjitske Starkenburg, Matthew Ho, Daniel Anglés-Alcázar, Romeel Davé, Austen Gabrielpillai, Kartheik Iyer, Alice E. Matthews, William J. Roper, Rachel Somerville, Laura Sommovigo, Francisco Villaescusa-Navarro 32 pages, 21 figures. Accepted to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We perform the first direct cosmological and astrophysical parameter inference from the combination of galaxy luminosity functions and colours using a simulation based inference approach. Using the Synthesizer code we simulate the dust attenuated ultraviolet-near infrared stellar emission from galaxies in thousands of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from the CAMELS suite, including the Swift-EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, Simba & Astrid galaxy formation models. For each galaxy we calculate the rest-frame luminosity in a number of photometric bands, including the SDSS $\\textit{ugriz}$ and GALEX FUV & NUV filters; this dataset represents the largest catalogue of synthetic photometry based on hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulations produced to date, totalling >200 million sources. From these we compile luminosity functions and colour distributions, and find clear dependencies on both cosmology and feedback. We then perform simulation based (likelihood-free) inference using these distributions to constrain $\\Omega_m$, $\\sigma_8$, and four parameters controlling the strength of stellar and AGN feedback. Both colour distributions and luminosity functions provide complementary information on certain parameters when performing inference. We achieve constraints on the stellar feedback parameters, as well as $\\Omega_m$ and $\\sigma_8$. The latter is attributable to the fact that the photometry encodes the star formation-metal enrichment history of each galaxy; galaxies in a universe with a higher $\\sigma_8$ tend to form earlier and have higher metallicities, which leads to redder colours. We find that a model trained on one galaxy formation simulation generalises poorly when applied to another, and attribute this to differences in the subgrid prescriptions, and lack of flexibility in our emission modelling.

The version of record is available online at: this https URL Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Drone-based beam measurements are a promising avenue to tackle the critical challenge of calibration for 21 cm cosmology telescopes. In this paper, we introduce a new drone-based calibration system for 400-800 MHz radio observatories, describing its instrumentation and first deployment. We discuss measurements of the TONE array, a CHIME/FRB outrigger pathfinder, and present results, including full 2D high spatial resolution beam maps in both co- and cross-polarization, as well as comparisons to simulations. The polarized beam maps cover a 70 degree by 70 degree grid, capturing the first two sidelobes and measuring the TONE main beam and first sidelobe with 7-9% statistical errors. We investigate polarization angle alignment with frequency, finding significant polarization leakage in the TONE antennas at frequencies above 600 MHz, and a polarization axis rotation with frequency. We describe statistical and systematic errors, as well as measurements of radio frequency interference from the drone and equipment. Our drone system is the first to incorporate a broad-band switched calibration source in the drone payload, enabling background subtraction and direct measurements of the RFI emitted by the drone. The results presented are the first drone-based 2D measurements of cross-polar beam structure and of polarization alignment of an array. The high frequency and spatial resolution achieved with this system have revealed the rich structure of the beam of each antenna, and enabled comparisons between individual dishes and to electromagnetic simulations.",

We model these winds as ideal magnetohydrodynamic outflows of hot plasma driven by global magnetic fields threading the accretion disk around the BH. Using Monte Carlo simulations with MONACO, we solve three-dimensional radiative transfer equations to determine the large-scale ionization structure that produces the observed ionic column densities. Focusing on the high/soft state of the BH XRB, where disk emission provides the dominant source of ionizing X-rays, we calculated synthetic spectra showing resonance absorption and scattered emission from ions in various charge states. Our results demonstrate that systems viewed at high polar angles exhibit prominent multi-ion absorption lines with asymmetric profiles, accompanied by P-Cygni-like emission features that partially reproduce the characteristics seen in the observed spectra. This further implies that even a dense disk wind with a high polar angle is unlikely to be saturated due to effective scattering.",

Ryan Jr High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) Time-Domain Field (TDF) has been monitored by NuSTAR and XMM-Newton with a regular cadence for five years starting in 2019. The survey has accumulated 3.5Ms of NuSTAR exposure and 228 ks quasi-simultaneous XMM-Newton observations covering 0.31 deg^2. This paper presents the results from the most recent two-years' 2Ms NuSTAR and 166 ks XMM observations in NuSTAR cycles 8 and 9. These observations reached a 20%-area flux of 2.20 x 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the 8-24 keV band. 75 NuSTAR sources and 274 XMM-Newton sources are detected at 99% reliability level. The logN-logS measured in cycles 8+9 are consistent with those measured in the previous cycle 5+6 NuSTAR NEP survey, but in a larger area (0.3 deg^2 compared with 0.19 deg^2). The slope of the cycles 8+9 8-24 keV logN-logS curve is flatter than other works ({\\alpha}89 = 1.13 +/- 0.46), but is consistent with the Euclidean value of {\\alpha} = 1.50. In addition, we found ~36% of the NuSTAR sources to be heavily obscured (NH >= 10^23 cm^-2). The Compton-thick (NH >= 10^24 cm^-2) (CT-) AGN fraction is 9+18-8% in the NEP-TDF, which is consistent with the measurements in previous surveys.",

Submitted to APJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a time-resolved, joint Swift-Fermi spectral study of GRB 241030A (z=1.411) that cleanly isolates the synchrotron origin of its prompt emission and favors a matter-dominated, internal-shock scenario. The light curve shows two episodes separated by a quiescent gap. Episode I (0-45 s) is well described by a single power law with photon index $\\simeq -3/2$, consistent with the fast-cooling synchrotron slope below the peak. Episode II (100-200 s), exhibits two robust spectral breaks: a low-energy break at $E_{b}$$\\sim$$2-3$ keV that remains nearly constant in time, and a spectral peak $E_{p}$ that tracks the flux within pulses but steps down between them. The photon indices below and above $E_{b}$ cluster around -2/3 and -3/2, respectively, as expected for fast-cooling synchrotron emission. The burst displays an unusually small (consistent with zero) spectral lag across GBM bands. At later times ($\\geq 230$ s), the spectrum softens toward $\\sim-2.7$, as expected when the observing band lies above both $\\nu_m$ and $\\nu_c$. These behaviors are difficult to reconcile with a globally magnetized outflow with a decaying field, which naturally produces hard-to-soft Ep evolution, growing $\\nu_c$, and appreciable lags. By contrast, internal shocks with a roughly steady effective magnetic field and a time-variable minimum electron Lorentz factor (equivalently, e.g., a varying fraction of accelerated electrons simultaneously account for (i) the stable $E_{b}$, (ii) the intensity-tracking yet step-down $E_{p}$, (iii) the canonical -2/3 and -3/2 slopes, and (iv) the near-zero lag.",

McLaughlin 11 pages, 10 figures, submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present evidence of an extreme scattering event (ESE) toward PSR J2313+4253 using high-cadence observations taken with the Green Bank Observatory 20m telescope. The high density of observations in time allow for detailed tracking of the event. We observe a pair of caustic spikes along with the characteristic drop in scintillation bandwidth that is expected during an ESE. This pattern implies that the structures predominantly responsible for scattering occur at different distances than those from previous and subsequent epochs. A secondary spectrum processed during the event shows a detached feature similar to those found in double lensing events from previously observed ESEs. We measure this event as originating from a scattering region with a distance of 1.04(1) kpc, a transverse size of 15 AU, and a duration of approximately 220 days. We model the event using a Gaussian plasma lens, which, when compared to a pure-noise model, is 197 times more probable. These rare events provide opportunities to study the properties of small-scale structures in the ISM.",

Yamada Accepted for publication in ApJL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present the first high-resolution X-ray spectrum of NGC 7213 obtained with XRISM/Resolve, supported by simultaneous XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and SOAR optical data. The XRISM spectrum resolves the neutral Fe\\,K$\\alpha$ into two components: a narrow core ($\\rm FWHM = 650_{-220}^{+240}\\,\\rm km\\,s^{-1}$) consistent with emission at the dust sublimation radius, and a broader, asymmetric line best described by disk-like emission from $\\sim 100\\,\\rm R_{g}$. This disk component mirrors the profile of the double-peaked H$\\alpha$ line observed in the optical. In addition, we detect broadened Fe XXV and Fe XXVI emission lines whose inferred locations bridge the gap between the inner disk and the optical broad-line region. The weak narrow Fe K$\\alpha$ equivalent width ($\\rm EW = 32 \\pm 6\\,eV$) and absence of a Compton hump imply a low-covering-fraction, Compton-thin torus. Together, these results reveal a radially stratified structure in NGC 7213, spanning nearly four orders of magnitude in radius, and place the source in an intermediate accretion state ($\\rm \\lambda_{Edd} = 0.001-0.01$) where the inner disk and BLR remain, while the torus shows signs of dissipation.",

El Mellah, P. Tzanavaris, P. Kretschmar 12 pages, 12 figures, A&A accepted on 26 Oct. 2025 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Vela X-1 is a well-studied accreting X-ray pulsar, with a distinctive pulse profile that has been found to be very similar in different observations spread out over decades. On the other hand, significant variations down to the timescale of individual pulses have been observed. The physical mechanisms leading to the energy-resolved pulse profile and its variations are not fully understood. Long, uninterrupted observations of Vela X-1 with XMM-Newton in 2000, 2006 and 2019 at different orbital phases allow us to study variations of the pulse properties in the soft X-ray range on all timescales in detail. We aim to characterize and quantify the variations of pulse profiles and individual pulse cycles on all timescales probed, and to identify possible factors driving the observed variations on these timescales. We generated consistent energy-resolved pulse profiles for each observation, as well as profiles built from subsets of individual pulse cycles selected by time, flux, or similarity to the mean profiles. We identified five pulsed phases based on the profile morphology and hardness, and examined the relative contributions over time. To quantify short-timescale variability, we compared individual pulse cycles with synthetic light curves derived from scaled versions of the average profiles. The pulse profile of Vela X-1, when averaged over many pulse cycles, remains remarkably stable, as expected. The most prominent variations between epochs are attributable to changes in absorption. Residual systematic differences are primarily flux-dependent, with profiles showing less variability at higher flux levels. On shorter timescales, most individual pulse cycles resemble the average profile, even though significant, sporadic deviations are also present.",

      "abstract": "Physical properties of long-rising type II Supernovae -- Bayesian Analytic Modelling and Spectrophotometric Correlations S. P. Cosentino, C. Inserra, M. L. Pumo High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Supernova (SN) 1987A, with its long-rising ($\\gtrsim$40~days) light curve, defines a rare subclass of type II SNe known as 1987A-like events. Representing only $\\sim$1-3\\% of all core-collapse SNe and often found in low-metallicity environments, their large diversity suggests a wide range of progenitor and explosion properties. This study aims to improve the understanding of 1987A-like SNe by characterizing their explosion parameters, including kinetic energy, ejected mass, progenitor radius at explosion, and synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass. Additionally, it seeks to identify systematic trends in both the physical properties and the observed features of these peculiar events. A new Bayesian parameter estimation method, based on our $^{56}$Ni-dependent analytical model for hydrogen-rich SNe, is applied to derive explosion parameters from the light curves and expansion velocities of one of the largest and most comprehensive 1987A-like SN samples to date. These data are measured through a consistent analysis of observations available in the literature. The analysis reveals a heterogeneous population that nevertheless clusters into two main groups: (i) lower-energy explosions with modest $^{56}$Ni yields ($\\sim$0.07~M$_\\odot$), similar to SN~1987A, and (ii) more energetic events (up to $\\sim$5~foe) with larger nickel production and, in some cases, unusually extended progenitors. We confirm a robust correlation between $^{56}$Ni mass, peak luminosity, and explosion energy, as well as between ejecta mass and recombination timescale. An anti-correlation between Ba~II line strength and photospheric velocity indicates that stronger Ba~II absorptions in 1987A-like SNe arise from more compact, slowly expanding ejecta. Our study underscores the need to extend analytical frameworks to include additional power sources, enabling scalable and accurate modelling of the growing number of peculiar transients.",

Its previous work is about forward shock (https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14715v1) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The origin of radio afterglows or delayed radio flares in tidal disruption events (TDEs) is not fully understood. They could be generated either by a forward shock (FS) propagating into diffuse circumnuclear medium (CNM), or a bow shock (BS) around a dense cloud, each of which is fundamentally different. To elucidate the distinctions between these two scenarios, we conducted two-fluid simulations incorporating relativistic electrons to investigate the spatial evolution of these electrons after being accelerated by shock. Based on their spatial distribution, we performed radiative transfer calculations to obtain the synchrotron spectra. In Paper I (Mou 2025), we reported the results for the FS scenario; in this article, we focus on the BS scenario. Compared to that from the FS, the radio emission from the BS exhibits a higher peak frequency, and its flux shows a much steeper rise and a more rapid decline. The radio flux from the BS also responds to fluctuations in the outflow. The combined effects of the BS and FS substantially alter radio spectra, causing significant deviations from the single-zone emission model, and in some cases producing double-peaked or flat-top features in spectra. This study highlights the importance of the BS, and inspires a novel approach for probing dense gas on sub-parsec scales in galactic nuclei by decomposing the BS radio spectrum to reveal the conditions of circumnuclear dense gas.",

This was the deepest such decrease, from the quiescent value of the flux, which has been observed in the past two decades. It resulted from a complex series of solar events, none of which on its own reached the most extreme level. The extreme depth of this Decrease has enabled measurements of the flux reduction to be made, which would normally be severely limited by particle counting statistics. In particular, here we examine the Decrease phenomenon over a primary cosmic ray energy range which is rarely accessible, due to the low flux of high energy cosmic rays. This work considers data mainly from a muon telescope system which can respond to both unaccompanied muons and small cosmic ray air showers, providing data from GeV to mid-TeV energies, where the Forbush Decrease ceases to be statistically observable. This paper examines the depth of the flux Decrease, as a fraction below its quiescent value, over that primary energy range. The progressive development of internal time structure in the flux through the seven days of the phenomenon is also demonstrated.",

In recent years, however, it has evolved to resemble a Type-2 or Compton-thick AGN. Herein, we report on the first XRISM observation of GRS 1915$+$105. The high-resolution Resolve calorimeter spectrum reveals that a sub-Eddington central engine is covered by a layer of warm, Compton-thick gas. With the obscuration acting as a coronagraph, numerous strong, narrow emission lines from He-like and H-like charge states of Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni dominate the spectrum. Radiative recombination continuum (RRC) features are also observed, signaling that much of the emitting gas is photoionized. The line spectrum can be fit by three photoionized emission zones, with broadening and bulk velocities suggestive of an origin in the outer disk atmosphere and/or a slow wind at $r \\simeq 10^{6}~GM/c^{2}$. The Fe XXV He-$\\alpha$ and Fe XXVI Ly-$\\alpha$ lines have a broad base that may indicate some emission from $r \\sim 3\\times 10^{3}~GM/c^{2}$. These results broadly support a picture wherein the current state in GRS 1915$+$105 is due to obscuration by the irradiated outer disk. This could arise through disk thickening if the Eddington fraction is higher than inferred, but it is more likely due to a warped, precessing disk that has brought the outer disk into the line of sight. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this interpretation and our modeling, and possible explanations of some potentially novel spectral features.",

In cold accretion discs (ADs) or the region of an AD where magnetic fields (MFs) are negligible (or absent), hydrodynamic (HD) turbulence is probably dominating. However, Magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is the primary cause of turbulence in ADs. Significant velocity variations and rapid pressure changes are characteristics of turbulent flows, which allow better mixing and more angular momentum (AM) and energy transfer. Also, in accretion flow (AF), the interaction between turbulence and resistivity determines the efficiency of energy dissipation and heat transfer. Radiation, convection, and thermal conduction (TC) are the heat transport modes existing in AFs, where TC enables energy transfer in accreting materials via heat flux. Moreover, convection, also generated by turbulence, significantly impacts the stability of the AD and its vertical structure. The disc may be affected by radiation from the AD surrounding the BH when X-ray emission occurs. The emission from the disc is also affected by dust particles. Dust grains near BH are exposed to high temperatures and intense radiation, which might affect the flow characteristics, as seen in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This chapter highlights the combined effect of turbulence, resistivity, transport mechanisms, and dust particles on BH AF. Future studies in this field must thoroughly investigate how dust, transport mechanisms, and turbulence interact in the BH accretion system.",

Zdziarski High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) X-ray observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate AT 2019avd show drastic variabilities in flux and spectral shape over hundreds of days, providing clues on the accretion disc-corona evolution. We utilize a disc-corona model, in which a fraction of the gravitational energy released in the disc is transported into the hot corona above/below. Some soft photons emitted from the disc are upscattered to X-ray photons by the hot electrons in the optically thin corona. By fitting the NICER observations of AT 2019avd during epochs when the spectra exhibit significant hardening, we derive the evolution of the mass accretion rate, $\\dot{m}$, and the coronal energy fraction, $f$. Our results show that $f$ decreases with increasing $\\dot{m}$, which is qualitatively consistent with that observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), while the slope of this source, $f\\propto \\dot{m}^{-0.30}$, is much shallower than that of AGNs. We also find that the non-thermal X-ray spectrum in this source is significantly softer than those typically seen in AGNs and black-hole X-ray binaries. We argue that these quantitative differences can be a powerful diagnostic of the underlying magnetic turbulence, which may imply a stronger magnetic field within the TDE accretion disc than that in typical AGNs. It is also found that the evolution of the fitted neutral hydrogen column density follows a similar pattern to that of the accretion rate evolution, which may reflect the accumulation of absorbing material originating from the inflowing streams of stellar debris and/or other related sources.",

The purpose is to address the issue of the low resolution that afflicts the $S_N$ method in the multi-dimensional neutrino transport simulations for core-collapse supernovae. We handle with a high resolution the advection term alone, assuming that the collision term does not require such high resolutions. To confirm this surmise as well as our new conversion scheme, from low- to high-angular resolutions and vice versa, we run a couple of experimental one-zone (in space) simulations. Neutrino scatterings on nucleons are considered with small recoils fully taken into account whereas the advection term is replaced by the angle- and energy-dependent source terms that are designed to mimic the results of a Boltzmann simulation, inducing the anisotropy in momentum space. For the conversion from a low-resolution distribution function to a high-resolution one, we employ a polynomial interpolations in the zenith and azimuth directions separately with the number conservation and continuity (and periodicity only in the azimuth direction). We find that this dual-resolution scheme works well and that the current angular resolution employed in the canonical supernova simulations with our Boltzmann solver or a bit better in the $\\phi_\\nu$ direction will be sufficient for the collision terms if they are coupled with the advection terms calculated with a high-angular resolution via this prescription.",

Here, we investigate the population properties of these binary black holes using the mixture-model framework Vamana. We present one-dimensional distributions of masses and spins, explore their correlations, and examine their evolution with redshift. These features may reflect astrophysical processes associated with binary black hole formation channels, although most remain poorly constrained. A notable feature is a peak near $10M_\\odot$ in the primary mass and $8M_\\odot$ in the chirp mass. Additionally, the primary and secondary masses correlate uniquely, producing pronounced peaks in the chirp mass around $14M_\\odot$ and $27M_\\odot$. The three peaks are roughly separated by a factor of two. A simple explanation for such well-placed peaks is a hierarchical merger scenario, in which the first peak arises from mergers of black holes of stellar origin, and higher-mass peaks arise from repeated mergers of black holes from lower-mass peaks. Although most binaries do not exhibit the high spins and characteristic mass ratios expected from hierarchical mergers, those that do are associated with the peaks observed in the chirp mass distribution.",

Pre-referee version, comments are appreciated High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Aims. eROSITA on board of the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG) spacecraft performed its first X-ray all-sky survey (eRASS1) between December 2019 and June 2020. It detected about 930000 sources, providing us with an unprecedented opportunity for a detailed blazar census. We present the properties of blazars and blazar candidates in eRASS1 and the compilation of the eROSITA blazar catalog. Methods. We compile a list of blazar and blazar candidates from the literature and match it with the eRASS1 catalog, creating the Blazars in eRASS1 (BlazEr1) catalog. For sources with more than 50 counts we obtain their X-ray spectral properties. We compile multiwavelength data from the radio to the gamma-ray regimes for all sources, including multiwavelength spectral indices and redshifts. The full catalog is available online. Results. We present the BlazEr1 catalog, containing 5865 sources, of which 2106 are associated with confirmed blazars. For 3668 sources, eROSITA provides the first X-ray data. The contamination from non-blazar sources of the entire sample is less than 11%. Most candidates exhibit properties typical for blazars. We present properties of the entire X-ray detected blazar population, including the distributions of X-ray luminosities and photon indices, multiwavelength properties, and the blazar log N-log S distribution. Our catalog provides follow up targets, such as potential MeV and TeV blazars. Conclusions. The BlazEr1 catalog provides a compilation of X-ray detected blazars and blazar candidates. The catalog serves as a starting point for exploiting further eROSITA surveys using the same methodology, enabling us to study the X-ray variability and a large number of spectral energy distributions of blazars in the future.",

Muneer, Maheswar Gopinathan High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Powerful, large-scale relativistic jets are usually associated with massive, old elliptical galaxies. This paradigm has recently been challenged by the identification of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies, thought to be young active galactic nuclei with low-mass black holes, harboring relativistic jets. Among them, sources hosting $>$100 kpc radio jets are extremely rare. Here, we report the discovery of large-scale, double-lobed radio structures in 33 NLSy1s with the projected linear size of at least 100 kpc from a recently published catalog of 22656 NLSy1 galaxies. These 33 include 29 confirmed double-lobed sources and 4 candidates whose radio structure requires further study. We suggest that their low black hole masses are unlikely to be due to their small angles of inclination to the line of sight. These enigmatic sources were identified by examining the radio observations taken with the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters, Very Large Array Sky Survey, Low Frequency Array, and Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey. Among them, the NLSy1 source J1318+2626 ($z=0.62$) is found to host a radio jet with the projected linear size of 4.3 Mpc, making it the only NLSy1 galaxy hosting a Mpc-scale radio jet known as of today. We conclude that future observations of NLSy1 sources with the next generation of sensitive telescopes may reveal a much larger population harboring large-scale jets, thus providing crucial clues on their origin, propagation, and interaction with the ambient environment.",

      "abstract": "Radiation-dominated polar emitting region of an accreting X-ray pulsar -- I. Polarization- and spectrum-dependent structure, and the emergent continuum M. I. Gornostaev High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The radiation-dominated polar emitting region of an accreting X-ray pulsar is simulated numerically in the framework of a three-dimensional (geometrically two-dimensional) model. The radiative transfer within the emitting region and the structure of the latter are calculated with the use of the self-consistent algorithm developed earlier. The magnetic scattering cross sections dependent on the photon energy and polarization have been incorporated. Second-order bulk Comptonization over entire emitting region, induced Compton scattering, the switching of the polarization modes, free-free processes, the cyclotron emission because of electron-proton collisions, and a realistic shape of the accretion channel have been taken into account. The case of a dipole magnetic field is considered. It is shown that the induced Compton effect can play a notable role in establishing the electron temperature in the post-shock zone. Within the model shock wave, a higher electron temperature is achieved than in the post-shock zone by means of the bulk-heating mechanism. The photons, gained the energy in the shock wave and above it due to bulk motion effects and the thermal Doppler effect, are responsible for the formation of high-energy regions in the emergent continuum of the polarization modes.",

Collating over a hundred years worth of photometry from scanned photographic plates and five modern surveys we find a historic outburst between ~1935-1960, with variation in Johnson B magnitude of ~0.8 that is consistent with Mrk 1018's brightness before and after its latest changing look event in the early 2010s. Using the combined modern and historic data, a Generalised Lomb-Scargle suggests broad feature with P = 29-47 years. Its width and stability across tests, as well as the turn-on speed and bright phase duration of the historic event suggests a timescale associated with long-term modulation, such as via rapid flickering in the accretion rate caused by the Chaotic Cold Accretion model rather than a strictly periodic CL mechanism driving changes in Mrk 1018. We also use the modern photometry to constrain Mrk 1018's latest turn-off duration to less than ~1.9 years, providing further support for a CL mechanism with rapid transition timescales, such as a changing mode of accretion.",

It is found that in the Hall-MHD regime, both whistler waves and ion-cyclotron waves can extract energy from the flow shear, resulting in two distinct branches of global instability. The non-axisymmetric whistler modes grow significantly faster than non-axisymmetric, ideal MHD modes. A discussion of the whistler instability mechanism is presented in the large-ion-skin-depth, `electron-MHD' limit. It is observed that the effect of the Hall term on the non-axisymmetric modes can be appreciable when $d_i$ is on the order of a few % of the width of the cylindrical annulus. Distinct global modes emerge in the Hall-MHD regime at significantly stronger magnetic fields than those required for unstable global MHD modes.",

We present three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction between an eccentric $5 \\,M_J$ giant planet and its $1\\,M_\\odot$ red-giant host star. The planet's pericenter is initially $60\\%$ of the stellar radius and is fully engulfed after tens of orbits. Once inside the stellar envelope, the planet generates pressure disturbances that steepen into shocks, ejecting material from the envelope. We use post-processing to calculate the light curves produced by planetary engulfment. We find that the hot stellar ejecta enhances the stellar luminosity by several orders of magnitude. A prolonged hydrogen recombination plateau appears when the ejecta cools to about $10^4\\,\\rm{K}$. The late-time rapid dimming of the light curve follows dust formation, which obscures the radiation. For planets with lower eccentricity, the orbital decay proceeds more slowly, although the observable properties remain similar.",

If the jet is pointed towards Earth, we observe a \"prompt\" gamma-ray burst due to internal shocks or magnetic reconnection events within the jet, followed by a long-lived broadband synchrotron afterglow as the jet interacts with the circum-burst material. While there is solid observational evidence that emission from multiple shocks contributes to the afterglow signature, detailed studies of the reverse shock, which travels back into the explosion ejecta, are hampered by a lack of early-time observations, particularly in the radio band. We present rapid follow-up radio observations of the exceptionally bright gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A which reveal an optically thick rising component from the reverse shock in unprecedented detail both temporally and in frequency space. From this, we are able to constrain the size, Lorentz factor, and internal energy of the outflow while providing accurate predictions for the location of the peak frequency of the reverse shock in the first few hours after the burst.",

However, not all active galactic nuclei (AGNs) exhibit clear signature of such feedback, and the dynamics of accreting gas on the inner sub-parsec scales remains poorly understood. Using high-resolution Chandra X-ray grating spectra of Mrk 3, we detect a fast inflowing ionized absorber characterized by redshifted Fe XXV and Fe XXVI absorption lines with confidence level in the $94-99.6\\%$ range. Photoionization modeling reveals the inflowing absorber is located at $\\lesssim0.04-0.74\\rm~pc$, with red-shifted velocity decreasing from $6.1\\pm0.5\\times10^3\\rm~km~s^{-1}$ to $3.4\\pm0.3\\times10^3\\rm~km~s^{-1}$ over 11 years. Only $\\sim0.6$\\%--$3$\\% of the inflowing material is estimated to reach the event horizon. This direct evidence of sub-parsec scale fueling inflow bridges the gap between the torus and the outer accretion disk. Additionally, a $0.86$-keV gas component with sub-solar metallicity ($Z\\sim0.22$), outflowing at a velocity of $\\sim330\\rm~km~s^{-1}$, is detected in the soft X-ray band from XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer, probably corresponding to shocked interstellar medium in the narrow-line region (NLR). The simultaneous presence of the apparent decelerating sub-parsec inflow and the NLR outflow favors a coherent scenario where a putative disk wind or broad-line region clouds may impede or even eject the accretion material, although other possibilities cannot be fully excluded.",

In such systems, an intrabinary shock can form between the pulsar and the companion winds, serving as a site for particle acceleration and associated non-thermal emission. Assuming that protons can be extracted from the neutron star surface and accelerated at the intrabinary shock and/or within the pulsar wind, we model the very high-energy gamma-ray and neutrino emissions ($0.1-10^3$~TeV) produced through interactions with the companion wind and the companion star. We first calculate the high-energy emissions using an optimistic combination of parameters to maximize the gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes. We find that, for energetic spider pulsars with a spin-down power $\\gtrsim 10^{35}\\rm erg\\, s^{-1}$ and a magnetic field of $\\sim 10^{3}\\, \\rm G$ in the companion region, the gamma-ray emission could be detectable as point sources by CTA and LHAASO, while the neutrino emission could be detectable by the future TRIDENT detector. Finally, we build a synthetic population of these systems, compute the cumulative neutrino flux expected from spider pulsars, and compare it with the Galactic neutrino diffuse emission measured by IceCube. We find that, under realistic assumptions on the fraction of the spin-down power converted into protons, the contribution of spiders to the diffuse Galactic neutrino flux is negligible.",

The origin of the velocity kick is intimately related to supernova physics. A better understanding of kick properties from astronomical observations will shed light on the unsolved problems of these explosions, such as the exact conditions leading to exotic electron capture and ultra-stripped supernovae. Kick velocities are profoundly important in several areas of astrophysics. Being a result of supernova explosions, the kick velocity distribution must be explained in the framework of the supernova mechanism. The kick magnitudes and directions influence many topics related to binary systems, including the rate of compact object coalescences observable through gravitational waves. Moreover, knowledge of the kick velocity distribution is significant in predicting future observational results and their interpretation. For example, it is expected that the Roman space telescope will discover many microlensing events related to neutron stars and black holes; accurate estimates of the number of observable microlensing events require precise kinematic properties of these compact objects.",

Becerra, Malte Busmann, Tomas Cabrera, Simone Dichiara, Lei Hu, Ravjit Kaur, Keerthi Kunnumkai, Ignacio Magana Hernandez Accepted for publication in ApJL on 10/22/2025 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The first joint electromagentic (EM) and gravitational wave (GW) detection, known as GW170817, marked a critical juncture in our collective understanding of compact object mergers. However, it has now been 8 years since this discovery, and the search for a second EM-GW detection has yielded no robust discoveries. Recently, on August 18, 2025, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration reported a low-significance (high false alarm rate) binary neutron star merger candidate S250818k. Rapid optical follow-up revealed a single optical candidate AT2025ulz ($z=0.08484$) that initially appeared consistent with kilonova emission. We quickly initiated a set of observations with \\textit{Swift}, \\textit{XMM-Newton}, \\textit{Chandra}, and the Very Large Array to search for non-thermal afterglow emission. Our deep X-ray and radio search rules out that the optical rebrightening of AT2025ulz is related to the afterglow onset, reinforcing its classification as a stripped-envelope supernova (SN 2025ulz). We derive constraints on the afterglow parameters for a hypothetical binary neutron star merger at the distance of AT2025ulz ($\\approx 400$ Mpc) based on our X-ray and radio limits. We conclude that our observational campaign could exclude a GW170817-like afterglow out to viewing angles of $\\theta_\\textrm{v}\\approx 12.5$ degrees. We briefly discuss the prospects for the future discovery of off-axis afterglows.",

The gwsnr Python package addresses this challenge by providing efficient and flexible tools for calculating the optimal SNR. It features a user-friendly interface and employs techniques such as a partial-scaling interpolation method for non-precessing binaries, a multiprocessing inner-product routine for frequency-domain waveforms that include spin precession and subdominant modes, among others. High computational performance is achieved through NumPy vectorization and Just-in-Time compilation with Numba, with optional GPU acceleration using JAX and MLX.

Yung, Xiurui Zhao 20 pages, 9 figures, accepted by ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Stellar flares are potent drivers of atmospheric evolution on orbiting exoplanets, primarily through extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray (XUV) irradiation. However, the contribution of hard X-rays (HXR; 3--20 keV)-which penetrate deeper into planetary atmospheres-to mass loss and particle acceleration has remained poorly understood. To quantify the HXR share of the total radiative budget, we conducted quasi-simultaneous observations of the active M-dwarf AU Mic using NuSTAR, Swift, and the Einstein Probe. Our analysis detected two major flares, and we performed an empirical check by deriving a quiescent-phase soft X-ray (SXR; 0.3--3 keV)-HXR relation and then applying it to the flares. By combining this with the quiescent coronal SXR-EUV relations conversion of J. Sanz-Forcada et al. (2011), we computed the total high-energy flux (EUV + SXR + HXR) and assessed the relative role of HXR in atmospheric escape. We find that HXR accounts for only a few percent of the total radiative energy budget during both quiescent and flaring states. While a high-energy spectral tail is detected in the second flare, time-resolved spectroscopy reveals a dominant chromospheric-evaporation signature, indicating that the flare energetics are primarily thermal.",

Utilizing high-resolution stratified, gravito-hydrodynamical models of SNe-driven turbulence with interstellar medium (ISM) cooling and heating, we explore how SNe-driven turbulence changes across different galactic conditions, parameterized by the galactic mass and potential, SNe-driving rate, and seeding functions. We show that even though the underlying ISM changes between starburst and Milky Way analogue models, the velocity fluctuations in the turbulence of both models, but not the kinetic energy fluctuations, can be normalized into a universal, single cascade, $u^2(k) \\propto k^{-3/2}$, where $u$ is the velocity and $k$ is the wavemode, indicating that the structure of the turbulence is robust to significant changes in the ISM and SNe seeding. Moreover, the cascades connect smoothly from the winds into the galactic disk, pushing the outer-scale of the turbulence, $\\ell_{\\rm cor}$, to over $\\ell_{\\rm cor} \\approx 6 \\ell_0$, where $\\ell_0$ is the gaseous scale-height. By providing an analytical model for the sound speed spectrum, $c_s^2(k)$, in the weak-cooling, adiabatic limit, we show that it is the compressible turbulent modes, $u_c$, that control the volume-filling phase structure of the galactic disks in our models, with $c_s^2(k) \\propto k^{-2} \\propto u_c^2(k)$. This may indicate that galactic turbulence does not only have highly-universal features across different galaxies, but also directly sets the volume-filling hot and warm phase structure of the underlying galactic ISM through turbulent compressible modes.",

Yi, Yohan Dubois, Julien E. G. Devriendt, Sebastien Peirani, Christophe Pichon Accepted for publication in MNRAS, 13 pages, 10 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We combine deep photometric data in the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields with high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to explore two key questions: (1) how does the galaxy stellar mass function, particularly in the dwarf (Mstar < 10^9.5 MSun ) regime, vary with environment, defined as distance from the large-scale structure (LSS) traced by nodes and filaments in the cosmic web? (2) is there a generic 'missing dwarfs' problem in LambdaCDM predictions when all environments - and not just satellites around Milky Way like galaxies - are considered? The depth of the observational data used here enables us to construct complete, unbiased samples of galaxies, down to Mstar ~ 10^7 MSun and out to z ~ 0.4. Strong environmental differences are found for the galaxy stellar mass function when considering distance from LSS. As we move closer to LSS, the dwarf mass function becomes progressively flatter and the knee of the mass function shifts to larger stellar masses, both of which result in a higher ratio of massive to dwarf galaxies. While the stellar mass functions from the three simulations (NewHorizon, TNG50 and FIREbox) considered here do not completely agree across the dwarf regime, there is no evidence of a generic missing dwarfs problem in the context of LambdaCDM, akin to the results of recent work that demonstrates that there is no missing satellites problem around Galactic analogues.",

Cohen, Matteo Correnti, Mark A. Fardal, Kristen B. W. McQuinn, Max J. B. Newman, Eduardo Vitral Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We present proper motion (PM) measurements for Draco II, an ultra-faint dwarf satellite of the Milky Way. These PMs are measured using two epochs of Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys (HST/ACS) imaging separated by a 7 year time baseline. Measuring PMs of low-luminosity systems is difficult due to the low number of member stars, requiring a precise inertial reference frame. We construct reference frames using three different sets of external sources: 1) stars with Gaia DR3 data, 2) stationary background galaxies, and 3) a combination of the two. We show that all three reference frames give consistent PM results. We find that for this sparse, low-luminosity regime including background galaxies into the reference frame improves our measurement by up to $\\sim2\\times$ versus using only Gaia astrometric data. Using 301 background galaxies as a reference frame, we find that Draco II's systemic PM is $(\\mu_{\\alpha}^*, \\mu_{\\delta}) = (1.043\\pm0.029, 0.879\\pm0.028)$ mas/yr, which is the most precise measurement of the three we present in this paper.",

In order to understand how galaxy quenching is related to galaxy sizes, we performed a demographic study of 46 massive quiescent central galaxies with stellar mass from $10^{10.5}\\rm M_\\odot$ to $10^{11}\\rm M_\\odot$ in the TNG50 simulation. We found that, in addition to the triggering active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, galaxy size is also a major determinant of the quenching process, as small and compact galaxies are immediately quenched by the kinetic AGN feedback, while galaxies with large sizes are still active until strangulated by the cutoff of new gas replenishment. Further spatially resolved inspection reveals that this short and intense kinetic AGN feedback can only suppress the star formation within 1-2 kpc, resulting in this size-dependent effect of quenching. We also identify a long-term effect of a few Gyr timescale that the gas inflow rate is progressively suppressed after triggering kinetic feedback, which appears to effectively quench large galaxies entirely. We conclude that kinetic AGN feedback has two key roles in quenching: a short-term, intense effect that quenches the central 2 kpc region, and a long-term effect that suppresses the gas inflow rate and further quenches the entire galaxy.",

Comments welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Thanks to new advances in astronomical imaging, we can now routinely explore disk galaxy profiles about two magnitudes deeper than the data available 20 years ago. In this regard, it is an opportune time to reevaluate the past classifications of different surface brightness Types. In this paper, we explore the stellar mass profiles of a sample of disk galaxies with similar stellar masses ($\\sim$10$^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$) using IAC Stripe82 Legacy Project data. We find that Type I, II-CT, and III-d galaxies exhibit edges at surface brightnesses $\\mu_g$(R$_{edge}$)$\\sim$26.5 mag/arcsec$^2$ and surface mass densities $\\Sigma$(R$_{edge}$)$\\sim$0.5-1 M$_{\\odot}$/pc$^2$. These surface brightnesses were outside the range of typical SDSS images and, therefore, unstudied. The present data suggest (although the statistics are inconclusive) that the main difference between the previous profile Types is the presence of either a more or a less intense bulge. Half of the Type II-CT galaxies are Sc, whereas half of the Type III-d galaxies are Sb. Finally, Type III-d galaxies have low mass surface density disks ($\\Sigma$($\\Delta$ $R_{\\mathrm{exp}}$)$\\sim$0.5 M$_{\\odot}$/pc$^2$) and are bluer $(g-r)_0$=0.32$\\pm$0.02 than the other Types ($(g-r)_0$=0.42$\\pm$0.02 for Type I and II-CT), suggesting that their disks probably formed later in time.",

Animation and interactive figure hosted on Google Drive at this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) At low redshift, massive quiescent galaxies (MQGs) are most frequently found in massive, rich galaxy clusters, but at high redshift the trend is less clear. Here, we present spectroscopic evidence of the effects of environment on the formation and assembly of high-redshift MQGs. We identify 25 (5) $\\log (M_*/\\mathrm{M_\\odot}\\geq10.5$ ($10.0\\leq\\log (M_*/\\mathrm{M_\\odot}<10.5$) spectroscopically-confirmed quiescent galaxies in the UDS and EGS fields at $3<z<5$ with NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy from RUBIES and other public JWST NIRSpec programs. We measure the density contrast in these fields by applying a Monte Carlo Voronoi Tesselation density mapping technique to photometric and spectroscopic redshifts of $m_\\mathrm{F444W}<27.5$ sources. We robustly detect 12 massive overdense peaks with $\\log (M_\\mathrm{Peak}/\\mathrm{M_\\odot})\\geq13$ and six extended massive protoclusters ($\\log (M_\\mathrm{Struct}/\\mathrm{M_\\odot})\\geq13.85$). We observe that MQGs are preferentially found in these massive peaks and within these massive structures: $\\approx50\\%$ of MQGs are found in massive peaks, compared to $\\approx20\\%$ of massive star forming galaxies (MSFGs) and $\\approx15\\%$ of the overall spectroscopically-confirmed population. We also find an apparent dependence on both quiescent galaxy mass and environment, with $75\\%$ of the most massive ($\\log (M_*/\\mathrm{M_\\odot}\\geq10.75$) residing inside overdense peaks. We compare the star formation histories (SFHs) of the MQGs with the high-redshift galaxy stellar mass function from observations and simulated quiescent galaxies at $z>5$, finding that the masses from the inferred MQG SFHs regularly exceed either observed or simulated high-redshift galaxies, which suggests indicates that mergers and ex-situ star formation play a key role in the mass assembly of MQGs in overdense environments.",

The G35 region shows a filamentary structure (a length of $\\sim$0.1 pc) with six bright cores located along the filament's long axis. Magnetic field strengths across the G35 region range from 0.2 to 4.4 mG with a mean value of 0.8 $\\pm$ 0.4 mG. The mass-to-flux ratio ($\\lambda$) varies from 0.1 to 6.0 the critical value. The highest values are found locally around cores, whereas the remains of the filament are subcritical. A H$^{13}$CO$^+$ (3--2) velocity gradient of 29 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ is evident along the filament's long axis, aligned with the magnetic field direction. At larger scales ($\\sim$0.1 pc), the magnetic field lines appear roughly perpendicular to the filament's long axis, in contrast to the smaller-scale structure ($\\sim$0.003 pc) traced by ALMA. The magnetic field lines could be dragged along the filament as a result of the gas motion induced by the gravitational potential of the filament. Six cores in the filament have similar spacings between 0.02--0.04 pc. The initial filament fragmentation could have produced a core spacing of 0.06 pc, following filament fragmentation theory, and the current core spacing is the result of cores comoving with the gas along the filament. This core migration could occur in a few 10$^4$ years, consistent with high-mass star formation time scales.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Observational studies of HII region-molecular cloud interactions constrain models of feedback and quantify its impact on the surrounding environment. A recent hypothesis proposes that a characteristic spectral signature in ground state hyperfine lines of hydroxyl (OH) -- the OH flip -- may trace gas that is dynamically interacting with an expanding HII region, offering a new means of probing such interactions. We explore this hypothesis using dedicated Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations of three Galactic HII regions, G049.205$-$0.343, G034.256+0.145 and G024.471+0.492, in 1--2 GHz continuum emission, all four 18-cm ground-state OH lines, and multiple hydrogen radio recombination lines. A Gaussian decomposition of the molecular gas data reveals complex OH emission and absorption across our targets. We detect the OH flip towards two of our sources, G049.205$-$0.343 and G034.256+0.145, finding agreement between key predictions of flip hypothesis and the observed multi-wavelength spectra, kinematics and morphology. Specifically, we demonstrate a strong spatial and kinematic association between the OH flip and the ionized gas of the HII regions -- the first time this has been demonstrated for resolved sources -- and evidence from $^{13}$CO(1--0) data that the expected OH component originates from the non-disturbed gas of the parent cloud. While we detect no flip in G024.471+0.492, we do find evidence of interacting molecular gas traced by OH, providing further support for OH's ability to trace HII region-molecular cloud interactions.",

From the MaNGA IFU survey, we use stellar absorption features D$_n$4000 and H$\\delta_A$ to identify regions that started the rejuvenation within the last $\\sim$200~Myr. We compare the gas-phase metallicity, metallicity gradients, environments, and H\\Romannum{1} gas fractions of the rejuvenating galaxies (RJGs) to controlled star-forming and quiescent galaxy samples. We demonstrate that, for the majority of RJGs, the rejuvenating gas is originally in the galaxy rather than accreted gas. The evidence includes: (1) gas metallicities consistent with the mass-metallicity relation of SF galaxies; (2) metallicity gradients that are not flattened, arguing against radial inflows; (3) gas velocities in rejuvenating regions consistent with their surroundings, and (4) high H\\Romannum{1} gas fractions comparable to SF galaxies, indicating a pre-existing reservoir. Furthermore, we find no evidence that the rejuvenating events are triggered by tidal interactions with neighbors. While internal processes appear to dominate, we also present a clear example of rejuvenation triggered by gas accretion. The galaxy MaNGA 12080-12705 hosts a low-metallicity, kinematically distinct star-forming region in an overall old, massive galaxy, providing unambiguous evidence of an external origin, such as accretion or a minor merger. Our analysis demonstrates that using D$_n$4000 and EW(H$\\delta_A$) provides a reliable way to identify current rejuvenation events in large spectroscopic surveys. The method will enable statistical studies to understand rejuvenation across cosmic time.",

      "abstract": "Rapid bulge assembly in young galaxy disks at Cosmic Dawn Anshuman Borgohain, Kanak Saha 30 pages, 33 figures, 3 tables, submitted to The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have begun to reveal a surprising morphological diversity in galaxies within the first billion years after the Big Bang, including indications of structural maturity previously thought to arise much later. These findings raise fundamental questions about when and how well-known structural components of galaxy morphology, such as bulges and disks, first emerged. However, directly identifying and resolving such structures at z $>$ 6 remains challenging due to limited spatial resolution and sensitivity. In this work, we present a clear and robust morphological analysis of a sample of 190 galaxies at z $>=$ 6, demonstrating that distinct bulge and disk components were already beginning to emerge during this early epoch. Using multi-component light profile fitting, we model the radial brightness distributions of a subset (20) of galaxies with an inner spheroidal (Sersic) component and an underlying exponential disk. These systems exhibit high bulge-to-total (B/T) light ratios (~ 0.47) and central stellar mass surface densities (~ 2.82*10$^{8}$ M$_{sun}$ kpc$^{-2}$ ) - values close to those of nearby quiescent galaxies. Combined with their intense central star formation rate surface densities (~ 1.26*10$^{1}$ M$_{sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$ ), our results indicate a rapid building of inner stellar mass and bulge assembly within these young systems. We propose that these early bulge-disk galaxies represent progenitors of massive star-forming and quiescent systems observed at lower redshifts. Their subsequent evolution may proceed through physical processes such as disk growth, compaction, quenching, or bulge-disk co-evolution, driven by both internal dynamics and external interactions.",

By employing the cumulative distribution function of dust temperature as a monotonic evolutionary indicator, we linearize clump evolution into a normalized timescale, enabling direct comparison across different samples. The virial mass of clumps increases exponentially with this normalized time, revealing an accelerating buildup of star-forming gas within protoclusters. The evolution of the maximum core mass further shows that the growth timescales of protoclusters and their embedded most massive protostars are comparable, implying a self-similar acceleration of star formation from the stellar to the protocluster scale. This unified framework naturally reproduces the observed evolution of luminosity, the core mass function, the mass growth of the most massive protostars, and the dense gas star formation law on clump scales, establishing a coherent picture of accelerating star formation across scales.",

We perform a physically motivated approach to the modeling of WA as a stratified medium in constant total pressure (CTP) regime. Powerful outflows are fundamental ingredients of any active galactic nuclei (AGN) structure. They may significantly affect the cosmological environment of their host galaxy. High-resolution X-ray data are best suited for outflow's studies, and the observed absorption lines on heavy elements are evidence of the physical properties of an absorbing gas. Our models allow us to fit continuum shapes bounded together with the line profiles, which gives additional constraints on the gas structure of WA in this source. In this work, we benchmark and test the CTP model on the soft X-ray spectrum of Mrk 509. A grid of synthetic absorbed spectra was computed with the photoionization code Titan assuming that the system was under CTP. As an illuminating spectral energy distribution (SED), we used the most actual multiwavelength observations available for Mrk 509. We apply these models to the high-resolution spectrum of the WA in the Mrk 509, taking into account cold/warm/hot Galactic absorption on the way to the observer. CTP gas with $\\log \\xi_{0} \\sim 1.9$, defined on the cloud surface, fits the data well. A higher ionization component is needed for Ne X absorption. The best-fit model is optically thin with $\\log N_{\\rm H }= 20.456 \\pm 0.016$. The lines are non-saturated, and the CTP spectral fit aligns with previous analyses of Mrk 509 with a constant density WA. The model constrains the gas density, placing the WA cloud at 0.02 pc, consistent with the inner broad line region and the thickening region of the accretion disk.",

Pudritz Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The scope of this paper is focused on the question if gas is transported to dense clumps inside high-mass star-forming regions through filamentary structures on a scale of several parsecs to the sub-parsec scale. We quantify the gas flows from a scale of up to several parsecs down to the sub-parsec scale along filamentary structures. In this work the accretion flow mechanisms based on gas kinematic data in the three high-mass star-forming regions G75.78, IRAS21078+5211 and NGC7538 are studied with data obtained from the IRAM 30 m telescope. The analysis is carried out using the surface density derived from 1.2 mm continuum emission and velocity differences estimated from HCO+ and H13CO+ molecular line data.",

The advent of mass measurements of radial velocities of stars has recently led to a number of interesting results obtained from the analysis of spatial velocities of stars and open star clusters. An important place in the study has been given to issues related to the clarification of the direct or indirect influence of magnetic fields on the process of formation of the Radcliffe wave.

Miranda, Susana Pedrosa, Lucas Bignone 9 pages, 7 figures, submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Context. Bulges, located at the central regions of galaxies, are complex structures, expected to be shaped by the physical processes involved in the assembly history of their host galaxy, such as gravitational collapse, mergers, interactions, and bars. As a consequence a variety of bulges with distinct morphology and chemistry could be produced. Aim. We aim at exploring the existence of a stellar mass-metallicity relation of bulges, MZ*R, and analyze the possible imprint of characteristics features by accretion and migration of stars, which could store information on their assembly histories. Methods. We use 44 central galaxies from the CIELO cosmological simulations. Their stellar masses are within the range of [10^7.6, 10^10.6] Msun. We decomposed the galaxy into bulge and disk using the circularity and binding energies. We track the stellar populations in bulges back in time to their birth location, classifying them as bulge-born in-situ, and disk-born stars and accreted. Results. We find that most of the stars in our bulges are formed in-situ, but 33% of our bulges show a non-negligible contribution of stellar accretion from satellites, which could add to about 35% of the population. The accreted material is generally contribute by two or three satellites at most. In some bulges, we also find up to a 32% of stars that migrated from the disk due to secular evolution, with a median of 10%. Regardless of the formation histories, we found a clear MZ*R for bulges, which is more enriched by about 0.4 dex than the corresponding relation of the disk components, and about 0.15 dex more enriched than the galaxy MZ*R. We find evidence that the dispersion in the bulge MZ*R is influenced by both stellar accretion from satellites and migration from the disk, such that, at a fixed bulge mass, bulges with higher fraction of accreted and migrated stars tend to be less metal-rich...

Comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate the properties of extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) at $z=4-9$ and their role in reionization. Compact, low-mass galaxies with intense optical emission lines are linked to elevated specific star formation rates (sSFRs) and recent bursts of star formation. Feedback in these systems may enable the leakage of ionizing radiation into the intergalactic medium. Using JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy from the CAPERS, CEERS, and RUBIES surveys, we compile 160 NIRCam-selected EELGs in the EGS field. These galaxies show extreme rest-frame equivalent widths (EWs), with a median EW([O III]+H${\\beta}$)=1616Å and EW(H${\\alpha}$)=763Å. They are low-mass (median log(M$_{\\star}$/M$_{\\odot}$)=8.26) with high sSFRs (median 43 Gyr$^{-1}$), above the $z\\sim6$ main sequence. UV slopes are diverse, with a mean $\\beta=-2.0$, and only 7% have extremely blue continua ($\\beta<-2.6$). Emission-line diagnostics suggest stellar populations as the primary ionizing source, although an AGN fraction of 14% is found. These galaxies are efficient ionizing photon producers, with mean log($\\xi_{\\rm ion}$ [Hz erg$^{-1}$])=25.34, exceeding typical values at similar redshifts. Escape fractions, however, are heterogeneous: 9% of EELGs show escape fractions $>$10% for both Ly${\\alpha}$ and LyC photons, while 82% lack detectable Ly${\\alpha}$ emission. The median inferred LyC escape fraction is modest (4.4%) but enhanced in super-Eddington systems with sSFR >25 Gyr$^{-1}$. The galaxies are extremely compact, with a median effective radius of 0.49 kpc, and exhibit a recent star-formation burst. Our analysis indicates that sSFR and star-formation rate surface density are the primary drivers of their extreme emission line strengths.",

L. C. Bakx, Miguel Pereira-Santaella 23 pages, 11 figures, 6 tables; accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present analysis of JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of the galaxy SXDF-NB1006-2 at $z = 7.212$, as part of the Reionization and the ISM/Stellar Origins with JWST and ALMA (RIOJA) project. We derive the physical properties by conducting spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, revealing that our target is a young (age $\\sim2$ Myr) starburst galaxy with intense radiation field. We detect multiple nebular emission lines from NIRSpec IFS data. We identify a robust broad component of [O III]$\\lambda5008$ emission, indicating the presence of ionized gas outflows. The derived gas depletion time of a few hundred Myr implies that our target could be one of the progenitors of massive quiescent galaxies at $z\\sim4-5$ identified by recent JWST observations. The spatial distribution of optical and far-infrared (FIR) [O III] emission lines differs in morphology, likely resulting from different critical densities and inhomogeneous density distributions within the galaxy. Potential old stellar populations may be necessary to account for the derived metallicity of $\\sim0.2\\,\\rm{Z}_\\odot$, and their presence can be confirmed by future MIRI observations. Including our target, star-forming galaxies at $z>6$ detected by ALMA are generally very young but more massive and brighter in UV than galaxies identified by only JWST. The ALMA-detected galaxies may also have a steeper mass-metallicity relation. These findings suggest that the ALMA-detected galaxies may have experienced more efficient mass assembly processes in their evolutionary pathways.",

We report photometry from STEREO-A's SECCHI HI1 and COR2, SOHO's LASCO C3, and GOES-19's CCOR-1 instruments in 2025 September--October, which show a rapid rise in the comet's brightness scaling with heliocentric distance r as r^(-7.5+/-1.0). CCOR-1 also resolves the comet as an extended source with an apparent coma ~4' in diameter. Furthermore, LASCO color photometry shows the comet to be distinctly bluer than the Sun, consistent with gas emission contributing a substantial fraction of the visible brightness near perihelion.",

Mondal Accepted for publication in Astrophysical Journal (ApJ) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Hybrid morphology radio sources (HyMoRSs) are a rare subclass of radio galaxies that display a Fanaroff-Riley type I (FR I) morphology on one side of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) and a type II (FR II) morphology on the other. In this study, we report the discovery of thirty-six new HyMoRSs, marking the largest collection of such sources in the southern sky to date, using data obtained from the MeerKAT absorption line survey (MALS). The identified HyMoRSs exhibit moderate radio luminosities in the range 9.9 $\\times 10^{23}$ to 5.7 $\\times 10^{25}~\\mathrm{this http URL^{-1}}$, with a median value of 4.4 $\\times 10^{24}~\\mathrm{this http URL^{-1}}$ at 1.4 GHz, and are located within the redshift range 0.04$<z<$1.34. In this work, we show for the first time that the two lobes of HyMoRSs exhibit no statistically significant difference in their spectral indices. We also investigate the mid-infrared properties and environments of their host galaxies. Notably, nine out of the thirty-six sources are situated near the centers of galaxy clusters, including one with giant radio jets that extend over 811 kpc. Our analysis reveals that the majority of HyMoRSs are hosted by actively star-forming galaxies that exhibit elevated star formation rates. Furthermore, our findings suggest that HyMoRSs may arise from FR II jets being deflected by a dense, cluster-like environment, along with orientation effects that make one jet appear FR I-like. As our candidates are selected through visual inspection of MALS radio maps, higher-resolution follow-up observations are still necessary to confirm the nature of their morphologies.",

Rey Accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The abundance and star-formation histories of satellites of Milky Way (MW)-like galaxies are linked to their hosts' assembly histories. To explore this connection, we use the PARADIGM suite of zoom-in hydrodynamical simulations of MW-mass haloes, evolving the same initial conditions spanning various halo assembly histories with the VINTERGATAN and IllustrisTNG models. Our VINTERGATAN simulations overpredict the number of satellites compared to observations (and to IllustrisTNG) due to a higher $M_{*}$ at fixed $M_{\\rm tot}$. Despite this difference, the two models show good qualitative agreement for both satellite disruption fractions and timescales, and quenching. The number of satellites rises rapidly until $z=1$ and then remains nearly constant. The fraction of satellites from each epoch that are disrupted by $z=0$ decreases steadily from nearly 100% to 0% during $4>z>0.1$. These fractions are higher for VINTERGATAN than IllustrisTNG, except for massive satellites ($M_{*}>10^{7}\\,M_{\\odot}$) at $z>0.5$. This difference is largely due to varying distributions of pericentric distance, orbital period and number of orbits, in turn determined by which sub(haloes) are populated with galaxies by the two models. The time between accretion and disruption also remains approximately constant over $2>z>0.3$ at $6-8$ Gyr. For surviving satellites at $z=0$, both models recover the observed trend of massive satellites quenching more recently ($<8$ Gyr ago) and within $1.5\\,r_{\\rm 200c}$ of the host, while low mass satellites quench earlier and often outside the host. Our results provide constraints on satellite accretion, quenching and disruption timescales, while highlighting the convergent trends from two very different galaxy formation models.",

The sample spans a wide range of stellar masses and UV luminosities. LyC emission is undetected in most galaxies (42/49), and stacking these galaxies yields only an upper limit on the observed LyC-to-nonionizing UV flux density ratio ($({F}_{\\lambda,\\rm{LyC}}/{F}_{\\lambda,\\rm{UV}})_{\\rm{obs}}<0.12$). Including all galaxies (with 7 LyC-leaker candidates) produces a marginal $2.4\\sigma$ detection, suggesting that the average LyC signal is driven by a small number of sources. To identify the conditions favorable for LyC escape, we perform stacking analyses in bins of stellar mass, UV slope, compactness, inclination, and star formation rate surface density. A stacked LyC signal is detected at a significance of $\\sim3\\sigma$ from a subset of galaxies that are characterized as being compact, have high star formation rate surface densities, and blue UV continuum slopes, despite each of these being individually undetected in LyC. This provides the first systematic evidence at $z\\sim 1-1.5$ linking these properties to LyC escape, consistent with trends observed in the lower redshift universe. Additionally, LyC leakage appears more efficient in low-mass galaxies ($\\log_{10}(M_{*}/M_{\\odot})<9.5$), with their average absolute escape fraction ranging from $\\langle f_{\\text{esc,abs}} \\rangle\\sim0.1-0.2$ depending on stellar population assumptions.

Their high density generally increases the suppression of star formation, known as quenching, altering galaxy properties. We study the quenching of emission-line galaxies (ELGs) in the rich cluster ZwCl 0024.0+1652 (Cl0024) at redshift $z\\sim0.4$, aiming to determine if and how star formation is suppressed. Using multi-object spectroscopy from the GLACE survey, we extracted fluxes and redshifts of [O II]$\\lambda\\lambda3727,3729$, $\\mathrm{H\\beta}$, and [O III]$\\lambda5007$ emission lines to derive star formation rates (SFRs) for 173 ELGs. We also performed spectral energy distribution fitting to obtain key evolutionary parameters such as stellar masses ($M_\\star$) and the 4000 Å break ($D4000$) index. We derived the $M_\\star-\\mathrm{SFR}$ relation for 98 star-forming galaxies (SFGs), finding 34.7% exhibit suppressed SFRs in the cluster, compared to 11.0% in the field. While the SFRs show no significant variation with local density, the fraction of SFGs is 1.55 times higher in the cluster outskirts than in intermediate-density regions. The specific SFR decreases strongly with $D4000$ for active SFGs but remains constant for suppressed galaxies. The fraction of suppressed galaxies in the infall region is 2.6 times higher than in the core, especially in the infalling structure B of the cluster. The cluster's total mass does not appear to be a key factor in SFG quenching. Star formation in Cl0024 galaxies is suppressed by the dense cluster environment. This suppression is evident in SFG fractions and parameters tracing long-term evolution, indicating prolonged quenching. The SFGs preferentially reside in low-density regions, while suppressed galaxies dominate the infall region, supporting a 'delayed-then-rapid' quenching scenario.",

They are found neighbouring two out of four known giant LANs at $z\\sim3$ in our MUSE follow-up observations, reinforcing the idea that Ly$\\alpha$ emission can be used to trace massive dark matter halos at high-$z$. This high occurrence of massive satellite halos agrees with simulations. With sizes of $\\simeq80\\times160$ and $80\\times100~\\mathrm{pkpc}^2$, the two nebulae are both $\\sim$300pkpc from the main LANs. The Ly$\\alpha$ emission is only shifted by $\\simeq100-300$ km s$^{-1}$ between each of the two pairs, suggesting connections via large-scale structure. RO-1001-Sat and RO-0959-Sat are estimated to have log$(M_\\mathrm{h}/M_\\odot)\\simeq13.2\\pm0.3$ and $12.8\\pm0.3$, putting them potentially close to the regime of cold-mode accretion. The central brightest galaxies in the two halos are morphologically distinct despite having similar stellar mass $\\sim10^{11}M_\\odot$, one being an elliptical quiescent galaxy in RO-1001-Sat and the other being a dusty star-forming spiral in RO-0959-Sat. Intriguingly, the quiescent galaxy aligns well with the peak of the LAN as well as the potential well of the host halo, making it the first clear-cut case where the cold gas ought to be accreting onto the galaxy but with no observable star formation, either due to morphological quenching or, more likely, radio-mode feedback from an active galactic nucleus. Finally, we show a tentative detection of a Ly$\\alpha$ filament connecting RO-1001 and RO-1001-Sat. This work shows how panoramic MUSE (and in the future, BlueMUSE) observations of massive halo seeds can be used to efficiently search for additional halos, unveiling their large-scale structure and enabling the study of Ly$\\alpha$-selected galaxy groups.",

Focusing on galaxies that experienced a major merger, we identify a characteristic azimuthal misalignment between the warp structures of stellar populations formed before and after the merger. This misalignment persists even after correcting for differential rotation, suggesting it is a dynamical imprint of the merger rather than a consequence of internal kinematics. In contrast, galaxies without significant merger events show no such offset between stellar populations of different ages. These findings support the scenario in which mergers can induce long-lived warps and leave detectable structural signatures in stellar disks. Applied to the Milky Way, this approach offers a potential way to test whether the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus merger contributed to the formation of the Galactic warp. It may also provide an independent means to constrain the timing of such merger events by examining the phase offsets in the stellar warp as a function of stellar age.",

Our analysis introduces a new, two-component visual classification scheme developed to capture the morphological diversity of galaxies over more than six orders of magnitude in stellar mass. Our morphological classifications use two parameters to describe the global structure and star formation activity of each galaxy. Structural sub-codes denote features such as spiral arms, bars, disks, shells, streams, while star formation sub-codes indicate the form and location of the current star formation activity (e.g., in cores, clumps, filaments, etc). These visual classifications rely on deep $g^\\prime$-band images, supplemented by $u^{*}g^{\\prime}i^{\\prime}$ color images, as well as unsharp-masked images for a subset of objects. We compare our classifications to previous results for bright member galaxies that used more established schemes, finding good agreement. We also measure quantitative classification statistics (e.g., CASGM$_{20}$) for a subset of the brighter galaxies, and present catalogs for some galaxy types of special interest, including structurally compact galaxies, ultra-diffuse galaxies, candidate ultra-compact dwarf transition objects, as well as candidate post-merger systems. These morphological classifications may be useful as a training set in the application of machine learning tools to the next generation of wide-field imaging surveys.",

Hollands, Pier-Emmanuel Tremblay, Kareem El-Badry, Antonio C. Rodriguez, Zachary P. Vanderbosch 88 pages, 81 figures, 13 tables (including appendix). Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The initial-final mass relation (IFMR) links a star's birth mass to the mass of its white dwarf (WD) remnant, providing key constraints on stellar evolution. Open clusters offer the most straightforward way to empirically determine the IFMR, as their well-defined ages allow for direct progenitor lifetime estimates. We construct the most comprehensive open cluster WD IFMR to date by combining new spectroscopy of 22 WDs with an extensive literature review of WDs with strong cluster associations. To minimize systematics, we restrict our analysis to spectroscopically confirmed hydrogen-atmosphere (DA) WDs consistent with single-stellar origins. We separately analyze a subset with reliable Gaia-based astrometric membership assessments, as well as a full sample that adds WDs with strong cluster associations whose membership cannot be reliably assessed with Gaia. The Gaia-based sample includes 69 spectroscopically confirmed DA WDs, more than doubling the sample size of previous Gaia-based open cluster IFMRs. The full sample, which includes 53 additional literature WDs, increases the total number of cluster WDs by over $50\\%$ relative to earlier works. We provide functional forms for both the Gaia-based and full-sample IFMRs. The Gaia-based result useful for $M_i \\geq 2.67\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ is $$M_f = \\left[0.179 - 0.100 H(M_i-3.84\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot) \\right ] \\times (M_i-3.84\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot)+0.628\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$$ where $H(x)$ is the Heaviside step function. Comparing our IFMR to recent literature, we identify significant deviations from best-fit IFMRs derived from both Gaia-based volume limited samples of field WDs and double WD binaries, with the largest discrepancy occurring for initial masses of about $5\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$.",

      "abstract": "Statistical Overview of Long-Lived Active Regions Observed Across Multiple Carrington Rotations Emily I. Mason, Kara L. Kniezewski 11 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The study of solar active regions (ARs) is of central importance to a range of fundamental science, as well as the practical applications of space weather. Active region emergence and life cycles are two areas of particular interest, yet the lack of consistent full-Sun observations has made long-term studies of active regions difficult. Here, we present results from a study to identify and characterize long-lived active regions (LLARs), defined as those which were observed during at least two consecutive Carrington rotations and which did not undergo significant successive flux emergence once the decay phase began. Such active regions accounted for 13% of all NOAA-identified ARs between 2011 and 2019, and their distribution closely follows the annual sunspot number. This implies that LLARs are produced by the same basic driving processes as regular ARs. LLAR areas tend to be significantly larger and contain more magnetic flux compared to other ARs, but the two categories have similar magnetic complexity distributions. The most striking result, however, is that LLARs are 3-6 times more likely than other ARs to be the source of a solar flare of GOES class C or greater. This highlights the importance of studying what makes a LLAR and how to identify them at emergence with a view towards improved space weather forecasting. The further implications of these findings for AR heating spatial and temporal patterns will be explored in an upcoming study.",

We investigate the characteristics of reconnection-driven nanojets just before and during a prominence eruption using the High Resolution Imager (HRI) of the Extreme Ultraviolet imager (EUI) aboard Solar Orbiter during its perihelion on September 30, 2024. Extreme UV (EUV) images at unprecedented high spatial and temporal resolution from \\hrieuv were analysed. The dimensions and propagation speeds of nanojets were estimated and used to estimate the kinetic energies. Nanojet activity was compared with GOES X-ray flux to assess its relation to flare evolution. The high spatial and temporal resolution in the EUV was found to be essential to fully capture the properties and numbers of reconnection nanojets. Approximately 120 nanojets were detected during the eruption, with 40 analysed in detail. Nanojets exhibited lengths of $200 - 5000$~km, widths of $200 - 500$~km and durations of $2-12$~s. Instant velocities ranged from 150 km~s$^{-1}- 600~$km~s$^{-1}$ with kinetic energies reaching $1.56\\times10^{27}$~erg. These nanojets are faster, longer, more energetic and more numerous compared to previous studies. We also find clear signatures of acceleration and deceleration, reflecting magnetic tension release and reach of new equilibria. Reconnection events during the eruption were found to be more frequent and energetically intense. Pre-flare nanojet clustering indicates small-scale reconnection may precede large eruptive activity. These results suggest that nanojets also occur in fully ionised coronal plasma, playing a role in both quiescent and eruptive solar activity.",

Here we present a systematic search for such disks through the Ca II infrared triplet using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Early Data Release. From a parent sample of 2706 spectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs, we identify 22 candidate systems showing tentative emission-line features, which corresponds to a raw occurrence rate of 0.81%, more than ten times higher than previous estimates. The detected emission lines are predominantly weak and require confirmation by follow-up observations. Three of these candidates also exhibit infrared excess in WISE photometry, suggesting a possible coexistence of gas and dust. However, the high candidate rate indicates that most are likely false positives due to telluric residuals or unresolved binaries. This work demonstrates the potential of DESI spectra for blind searches of rare circumstellar phenomena. The recently released DESI DR1, with its substantially larger spectroscopic sample, will enable searches for more gaseous disks and provide better insights into their occurrence and nature.",

High-velocity jets, extending up to 720 au, are detected in CO, SiO, and SO lines. The jet launching region is likely within twice of the dust sublimation zone. The absence of a binary signature suggests the outflows and jets are driven by a single protostar, although a close binary cannot be ruled out. The observed deflection of the outflows and jet is likely due to turbulent accretion in a moderately magnetized core.",

We give an overview of models that self-consistently form solar (or stellar) prominences and filaments, or (postflare) coronal rain, and clarify how these different phenomena share a common physical origin, relating radiative losses and coronal heating. While we do not fully understand the coronal heating, multi-dimensional models of solar prominence and rain formation demonstrate how thermal instability triggers condensations, and how their morphology may reveal aspects of the applied heating at play. We emphasize how the many pathways to linear instability due to combined ingredients of heat-loss, gravity, flows, and magnetic topologies are all involved in the resulting nonlinear magnetohydrodynamics.

Shimwell 16 pages, 15 figures, 1 table. Accepted for publication in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Brown dwarfs display Jupiter-like auroral phenomena, such as rotationally modulated electron cyclotron maser radio emission. Radio observations of cyclotron maser emission can be used to measure their magnetic field strength, topology, and to deduce the presence of magnetically interacting exoplanets. Observations of the coldest brown dwarfs (spectral types T and Y) are especially intriguing, as their magnetospheric phenomena could closely resemble those of gas-giant exoplanets. Here we report observations made over ten epochs, amounting to 44 hours, of WISEP J101905.63+652954.2 (J1019+65 hereinafter) using the LOFAR telescope between 120 and 168 MHz. J1019+65 is a methane dwarf binary (T5.5+T7) whose radio emission was originally detected in a single-epoch LOFAR observation to be highly circular polarised and rotationally modulated at $\\approx 3$h. Unexpectedly, our long-term monitoring reveals an additional periodic signature at $\\approx 0.787$h. We consider several explanations for the second period and suggest that it could be the rotationally modulated emission of the second brown dwarf in the binary, although follow-up infrared observations are necessary to confirm this hypothesis. In addition, the data also allow us to statistically estimate the duty cycle and observed radio-loud fraction of the 120-168\\,MHz cyclotron emission from methane dwarfs to be $\\langle D \\rangle = 0.030^{+0.034}_{-0.030}$ and $F^{'}_{\\rm radio} = 0.088^{+0.168}_{-0.088}$ respectively.",

Most methods, including radio observations, used for estimating coronal electron density were not fully validated due to the absence of in situ observations closer to the Sun. Consequently, space weather forecasting models that simulate coronal density lacked proper validation. Newly available PSP in situ observations at distances close to the Sun provide an opportunity to study plasma properties near the Sun and to compare observational and modeling results. This work studies type III bursts, estimates their propagation path, and validates coronal electron density obtained from radio, in situ observations, and modeling with EUHFORIA. Type III bursts observed during the second PSP perihelion are analyzed using radio triangulation and modeling. We determine 3D positions of radio sources and use EUHFORIA to estimate electron densities at various locations. The electron densities derived from radio observations and EUHFORIA modeling are inter-validated with in situ PSP measurements. We studied 11 type III bursts during the second PSP perihelion, with radio triangulation showing propagation paths southward from the solar ecliptic plane. Radio source sizes ranged from 0.5 to 40 deg (0.5 to 25 Rs) with no clear frequency dependence, indicating that scattering of radio waves was not very significant. Comparison of electron densities from radio triangulation, PSP data, and EUHFORIA modeling showed a large range of values, influenced by different propagation paths and model limitations. Despite these variations, EUHFORIA identified high-density regions along type III burst paths.",

Thompson 14 pages, 9 Appendix, 9 figures Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The astrophysical origin of the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process), which produces about half of the elements heavier than iron, remains uncertain. The oldest, most metal-poor stars preserve the chemical signatures of early nucleosynthesis events and can reveal the nature of the r-process sites. We present a homogeneous chemical abundance analysis of ten r-process-enhanced, metal-poor stars that show strong enrichment in r-process elements with minimal contamination from other nucleosynthetic sources. Using high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra, we examined over 1400 absorption lines per star through equivalent width measurements and spectral synthesis under one-dimensional LTE assumptions with the MOOG radiative transfer code. Abundances for 54 chemical species were derived, including 29 neutron-capture elements spanning the full r-process pattern. We quantified the cosmic scatter of elemental ratios relative to Zr (light) and Eu (heavy) and found remarkably small dispersions for the rare-earth and third-peak elements, {\\sigma}[La/Eu] = 0.08 dex and {\\sigma}[Os/Eu] = 0.11 dex, while the light-to-heavy ratio shows slightly larger variation, {\\sigma}[Zr/Eu] = 0.18 dex. A kinematic study indicates that the stars likely originated from ten distinct progenitor systems, allowing us to probe the intrinsic variation between independent r-process events. These results imply that the main r-process operates under highly uniform conditions across diverse astrophysical sites.",

Valori Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (SO/PHI) onboard Solar Orbiter is a spectropolarimeter scanning the Fe I line at 617.3 nm, providing data of the solar photosphere. The same line is sampled by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and many other on-ground instruments. In this paper, we aim at assessing the consistency between line-of-sight (LoS) velocity measurements from the two instruments. Reliable measurements of up and down flows from SO/PHI are crucial and unique when Solar Orbiter is facing the far side of the Sun. Also, a combination of measurements from two vantage points to study horizontal flows must rely on consistent observations. For this purpose, we compare the LoS velocity measured by SO/PHI's High Resolution Telescope (SO/PHI-HRT) and SDO/HMI on 29 March 2023, when Solar Orbiter was crossing the Sun-Earth line at a distance of 0.39 au from the Sun. Because such co-alignments are rare, this configuration offered an almost unique opportunity to directly compare data products from both telescopes. The data are aligned and remapped to allow a pixel-by-pixel comparison of the whole time series of 4 hours length. Temporal and spatial variations are considered for a direct combination of the measurements. The LoS velocity distributions are evaluated and a clear linear relation is found between the two instruments with a slope of 0.94 and a correlation of 90%. We find that the signals form at similar heights, with a separation of 10$\\pm$12 km, which is larger than previous estimates. A close-up look at the penumbra of a sunspot and its Evershed flow is presented. We conclude that the signals inferred by SO/PHI-HRT and SDO/HMI show very good agreement and high correlation when instrumental effects and large-scale velocities on the Sun are properly accounted for.",

Liu, Chuanpeng Hou Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) Turbulence is a ubiquitous process that transfers energy across many spatial and temporal scales, thereby influencing particle transport and heating. Recent progress has improved our understanding of the anisotropy of turbulence with respect to the mean magnetic field; however, its exact form and implications for magnetic topology and energy transfer remain unclear. In this Letter, we investigate the nature of magnetic anisotropy in compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence within low-$\\beta$ solar wind using Cluster spacecraft measurements. By decomposing small-amplitude fluctuations into Alfvén and compressible modes, we reveal that the anisotropy is strongly mode dependent: quasi-parallel (`slab') energy contains both Alfvén and compressible modes, whereas quasi-perpendicular (`two-dimensional'; 2D) energy is almost purely Alfvénic, a feature closely linked to collisionless damping of compressible modes. These findings elucidate the physical origin of the long-standing `slab+2D' empirical model and offer a new perspective on the turbulence cascade across the full three-dimensional wavevector space.",

Roth, Fatma Ben Daya, Jörg Knoche, Stella Vješnica, Paško Roje, Mike Kretlow, Stefan Cikota To be submitted to A&A, 6 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Ultracompact Galactic binary systems (UCBs) emit low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs). The emission of GWs is causing these systems to lose angular momentum, which is detectable by observing an orbital period decay. ZTFJ213056.71+442046.5 (ZTFJ2130) is an UCB with a period of 39.3401(1) minutes consisting of a Roche lobe-filling hot subdwarf and a white dwarf companion. We attempt to measure the orbital decay rate $\\dot{P}$ caused by GW emission of ZTFJ2130 and predict the expected GW signal for LISA. High-speed photometry was conducted using the FLI Kepler KL4040FI CMOS camera, mounted to the 1.2-meter Oskar Lühning telescope at the Hamburg Observatory as well as the Hamamatsu ORCA-Quest 2 qCMOS camera at the 1.23-meter telescope at CAHA in Spain. ZTFJ2130 was observed on six nights between August 2024 and September 2025. The obtained lightcurves combined with previous high-cadence observations were used to conduct an O-C timing analysis. Additionally, we employed the LISA data analysis tool ldasoft to model the expected GW data. We measure a period change of $(-1.97\\pm0.05)\\times10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{ss^{-1}}$. Assuming only GW emission, this result was used to calculate a chirp mass of $(0.408\\pm0.006)\\,\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$. From ldasoft we predict that LISA will be able to measure the chirp mass with an uncertainty of 5%. We measure $\\dot{P}$ with an uncertainty of only 2% and show that modern (q)CMOS detectors are well suited to provide precise timing measurements, enabling the measurement of the orbital decay of UCBs with high precision with modest size telescopes. The derived orbital decay is fully consistent with predictions from spectral and lightcurve modeling. We show that future observations with LISA can potentially provide a deviation from only gravitational wave effects, e.g. due to accretion, if the effect is sufficiently large.",

Panero, Francesca Miozzi, Ashika Capirala, Johanna K. Teske Accepted to ApJ, 17 pages, 8 Figures Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The amount of surface water is thought to be critical for a planet's climate stability and thus habitability. However, the probability that a rocky planet may exhibit surface water at any point its evolution is dependent on multiple factors, such as the initial water mass, geochemical evolution, and interior composition. To date, studies have examined the influence of interior composition on the water inventory of the planet or how surface oceans may be impacted by planet topography individually. Here, we provide the first exploration on the impact of interior composition, topography, and planet radius on the water inventory of rocky planets using a sample of 689 rocky planets with spectroscopically derived stellar abundances from APOGEE and GALAH. We find that the oxidation state of the mantle (FeO content) significantly impacts the mantle water storage capacity and potential for surface flooding. For an FeO ~11 wt%, the water storage capacity of a 1 M$_\\oplus$ is 2 times that of Earth, indicating that the oxidation state may reduce the amount of surface water. We quantify the impact of topography on seafloor pressures, showing that flat topographies are more likely to be flooded for all planet compositions and radii. We also find that Mars-like topographies are more likely to have seafloor pressures that may form high-pressure ice, reducing seafloor weathering. Thus, for the first time, we show that the composition and topography of the mantle influence the water inventory of rocky planets.",

Accepted for publication in MNRAS Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Circumbinary configurations offer a test of planet formation in an altered environment, where the inner binary has perturbed a protoplanetary disc. Comparisons of the physical and orbital parameters between the circumbinary planet population and the population of exoplanets orbiting single stars will reveal how these disc perturbations affect the assembly of planets. Circumbinary exoplanets detected thus far typically have masses $< 3 \\,\\rm M_{jup}$ raising the question of whether high-mass circumbinary planets are possible, and also whether population features such as the brown dwarf desert would appear in circumbinary configurations like for single star systems. Here, we report observations taken with the SOPHIE high-resolution spectrograph. These observations reveal an $m_{\\rm b}\\,\\sin i_{\\rm b} = 20.9 \\,\\rm M_{jup}$ outer companion, on an eccentric ($e = 0.43$), $1800\\,\\rm d$ orbit, which we call BEBOP-4 (AB) b. Using dynamical arguments we constrain the true mass $m_{\\rm b}< 26.3 \\,\\rm M_{jup}$. The inner binary's two eclipsing stellar components have masses $M_{\\rm A} = 1.51\\,\\rm M_\\odot$, and $M_{\\rm B} = 0.46\\,\\rm M_\\odot$. Their orbital period is $72\\,\\rm d$, and their eccentricity is $0.27$. This system contains the longest period binary surveyed by the BEBOP project. BEBOP-4b is expected to be detectable using Gaia DR4 single epoch astrometric measurements. Despite a large period ratio of $\\sim 25:1$, the substantial eccentricities of both orbits mean that the outer orbit is on the edge of orbital stability, and located in between two destabilising secular resonances. Should the outer companion survive, the BEBOP-4 system appears like a precursor to several post-common envelope binaries exhibiting eclipse timing variations where very massive circumbinary companions have been proposed.",

Despite the recent significant advancements in instrumental developments, the current limitation in detecting these exoplanets is the intrinsic variability of the host star itself. Aims. Our aim is to use the full CARMENES guaranteed time observations (GTO) data set spanning more than 8 years of observations of over 350 stars to investigate the wavelength dependence of high-precision radial velocities (RV), as stellar activity features should exhibit a wavelength dependence while the RV variation due to an orbiting planet will be wavelength independent. Methods. We use the chromatic index (CRX) to quantify the slope of the measured RVs as a function of logarithmic wavelength. We investigate the dependence of the CRX in the full CARMENES GTO sample on 24 stellar activity indices in the visible and near-infrared channels of the CARMENES spectrograph and each star's stellar parameters. We also present an updated convective turnover time scaling for the calculation of the stellar Rossby number for M dwarfs. Results. Our results show that approximately 17\\% of GTO stars show a strong or a moderate correlation between CRX and RV. We can improve the measured RVs by a factor of up to nearly 4 in rms by subtracting the RV predicted by the CRX-RV correlation from the measured RVs. Mid M dwarfs with moderate rotational velocities, moderate CRX-gradients and quasi-stable activity features have the best rms improvement factors. Conclusions. We conclude that the CRX is a powerful diagnostic in mitigation of stellar activity and the search for low mass rocky planets.",

Barker, Rainer Hollerbach 26 pages, 14 figures, 3 tables; accepted for publication in MNRAS Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Tidal dissipation in star-planet systems occurs through various mechanisms, including the precessional instability. This is an instability of laminar flows (``Poincaré flows\") forced by axial precession of a rotating, oblate, spin-orbit misaligned fluid planet or star, which excites inertial waves in convective regions if the dimensionless precession rate (``Poincaré number\" $\\mathrm{Po}$) is sufficiently large. We constrain the contribution of the precessional instability to tidal dissipation and heat transport, using Cartesian hydrodynamical simulations in a small patch of a planet, and study its interaction with turbulent convection, modelled as rotating Rayleigh-Bénard convection. The precessional instability without convection results in laminar flow at low values and turbulent flow at sufficiently high values of $\\mathrm{Po}$. The associated tidal dissipation rate scales as $\\mathrm{Po}^2$ and $\\mathrm{Po}^3$ in each regime, respectively. With convection, the Poincaré number at which turbulent flow is achieved shifts to lower values for stronger convective driving. Convective motions also act on large-scale tidal flows like an effective viscosity, resulting in continuous tidal dissipation (scaling as $\\mathrm{Po}^2$), which obfuscates or suppresses tidal dissipation due to precessional instability. The effective viscosities obtained agree with scaling laws previously derived using (rotating) mixing-length theory. By evaluating our scaling laws using interior models of Hot Jupiters, we find that the precessional instability is significantly more efficient than the effective viscosity of convection. The former drives alignment in 1 Gyr for a Jupiter-like planet orbiting within 23 days. Linearly excited inertial waves can be even more effective for wider orbits, aligning spins for orbits within 53-142 days.",

      "abstract": "Engulfment of a hot Jupiter as a possible origin of the rapid spin and internal spin misalignment of the planet-hosting red giant Kepler-56 Takato Tokuno 12 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in MNRAS Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) A recent asteroseismic analysis suggests that Kepler-56 -- a planet-hosting red giant -- exhibits a unique spin structure: (1) the spin axes of the core and envelope are misaligned; and (2) the envelope rotates approximately an order of magnitude faster than typical red giants. In this paper, we investigate a feasible scenario to reproduce this spin structure by estimating the amount of the angular momentum (AM) supply from the planets through the simplified calculation of the time evolution of AM. As a result, unless the tidal efficiency is extremely high, we show that the tidal interactions between the known close-in planets (Kepler-56 b and c) are insufficient to supply the AM required to accelerate Kepler-56 from the spin rate observed in typical red giants. We also show that the engulfment of a hot Jupiter can be expected to provide sufficient AM supply for the acceleration ant that the mass and orbit of the engulfed hot Jupiter are constrained by a mass of 0.5-2 Jupiter masses and an orbital period of 1-6 days. On the other hand, if Kepler 56 was already rapidly spinning before entering the RG stage and requires no acceleration, the obliquity damping by the known close-in planets can reproduce the spin structure of Kepler-56. Even in such cases, planetary engulfment during the MS stage might be involved in achieving rapid spin before the tidal alignment. These discussions demonstrate the importance of Kepler-56 as a candidate for planetary engulfment that may leave traces of its spin structure.",

PhyE2E simplifies symbolic regression by decomposing it into sub-problems using the second-order derivatives of an oracle neural network, and employs a transformer model to translate data into symbolic formulas in an end-to-end manner. The resulting formulas are refined through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers, solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions, near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another independent study. Moreover, we found physical formulas that can describe the relationships between emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun, temperatures, electron densities, and magnetic fields. The formula obtained is consistent with the properties that physicists had previously hypothesized it should possess.",

Skowron Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Letters -- 4 pages main journal, 2 pages Appendix, 1 video online material Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) [abbreviated] Long Secondary Periods (LSPs) are observed in about one third of pulsating red giants yet remain unexplained. Four key observational constraints anchor the discussion: (i) a roughly 30 percent occurrence rate in semi-regular variable AGB stars (SRVs), with a much lower rate or absence in regularly pulsating Mira-type AGB stars (Miras), (ii) about 50 percent of LSP stars show a secondary mid-infrared minimum, (iii) Keplerian fits to radial-velocity curves favor argument of periastron greater than 180 degrees, and (iv) the radial-velocity to light-curve phase lag clusters around minus 90 degrees. We test whether a close-in, eccentric, low-mass companion that spends only part of its orbit within the giant's dust-formation zone can match all four empirical constraints. Guided by observed radial-velocity amplitudes and periods of about 500 to 1500 days, we adopt companion masses of 0.08 to 0.25 solar masses, orbital separations of 1.5 to 3 AU, eccentricities up to 0.6, and dust condensation radii of about 2.5 to 3 AU for SRVs (larger for Miras via scaling with luminosity). We compute the fraction of the orbit spent outside the condensation radius and apply line-of-sight criteria for detectability. We test the first three empirical constraints analytically, then model the phase offset using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. Our scenario explains the observed excess of systems with argument of periastron greater than 180 degrees and yields LSP detectability of about 27 percent for SRVs and about 2.5 percent for Miras, with a conditional secondary mid-infrared eclipse fraction of about 44 percent. The hydrodynamical models place the optical-depth maximum downstream of the companion near apastron and then shift it forward by roughly 90 to 225 degrees later in the orbit, consistent with the observed radial-velocity to light-curve offsets.",

Storey Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics (A&A). 24 pages Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We discuss the requirements, concepts, simulations, implementation, and calibration of two dual Fabry-Perot based imaging spectropolarimeters, CRISP and CHROMIS, at the Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope, and CRISP2 that is under construction. These instruments use a combination of a high-resolution and a low-resolution etalon together with an order-sorting prefilter to define the bandpass. The overall design is made robust and stable by tailoring the low-resolution etalon reflectivity to accommodate expected cavity errors from both etalons, and by using a compact optical design that eliminates the need for folding mirrors. By using a telecentric design based on lenses rather than mirrors, image degradation by the FPI system is negligible, as shown in a previous publication, and the throughput of the system is maximised. Initial alignment, and maintaining that alignment over time, is greatly simplified. The telecentric design allows full calibration and/or modelling of essential system parameters to be carried out without interfering with the optical setup. We also discuss briefly the polarimeters developed for CRISP and CHROMIS. The high performance of CRISP and CHROMIS has been demonstrated in an earlier publication through measurements of the granulation contrast and comparisons with similar measurements simultaneously made through broadband continuum filters. Here, we focus on the aspects of the design that are central to enabling high performance and robustness, but also discuss the calibration and processing of the data, and use a few examples of processed data to demonstrate the achievable image and data quality. We put forward a proposal for a similar conceptual design for the European Solar Telescope and conclude by discussing potential problems of the proposed approach to designs of this type. Some aspects of these FPI systems may be of interest also outside the solar community.",

Submitted to AAS Journals. Comments welcome Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG) In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language understanding through vast datasets and large-scale parameterization. Inspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework that extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data. Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities offer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively trained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance precision stellar spectroscopy.",

The proposed method combines osculating orbital elements, Chebyshev polynomials, and Fourier series to efficiently represent lunar satellite trajectories subject to complex perturbations from lunar gravity and third-body effects. For the ephemeris, a hybrid Chebyshev--Fourier formulation improves fitting accuracy over long arcs while maintaining message compactness under the data-size constraint of the LunaNet Interoperability Specification. For the almanac, a compact low-order polynomial and Fourier model is introduced to capture mid-term orbital variations over a 15-day fitting arc. The approach is validated for multiple orbit regimes, including 30-hour, 24-hour, and 12-hour elliptical lunar frozen orbits (ELFOs) and a 6-hour polar orbit. Results show that the proposed framework achieves sub-meter position and sub-millimeter-per-second velocity fitting errors within the 900-bit limit for 6-hour ephemeris arcs, and almanac fitting accuracy sufficient for reliable satellite-visibility identification in warm-start operations.",

John Tomsick submitted to ApJ the 23th of october 2025 Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a Compton telescope designed to survey the 0.2 - 5 MeV sky, consisting of a compact array of cross-strip germanium detectors. It is planned to be launched in 2027 into an equatorial low-Earth (530 km) orbit with a prime mission duration of 2 years. The observation of MeV gamma rays is dominated by background, mostly from extragalactic and atmospheric photon but also from the activation of the detector materials induced by cosmic-ray interactions. Thus, background simulation and identification are crucial for the data analysis. In this work we perform Monte Carlo simulations of the background for the first 3 months in orbit, and we extrapolate the results to 2 years in orbit, in order to determine the build-up of the activation due to long-lived isotopes. We determine the rates of events induced by the background that are reconstructed as Compton events in the simulated COSI data. We find that the extragalactic background photons dominate at low energies (<660 keV), while delayed activation from cosmic-ray primaries (proton/alpha) and albedo photons dominate at higher energies. As part of this work, a comparison at low latitude (<1 deg) between recent measurement of the SAA by the High-Energy Particle Detector (HEPD-01) on board the China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES-01) and the AP9/AE9 model has been made, showing an overestimation of the flux by a factor 9 by the model. The systematic uncertainties associated with these components are quantified. This work marks a major step forward in estimating and understanding the expected background rates for the COSI satellite mission.",

The method employs C-band continuous waveforms transmitted from NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) Canberra station, with reflected signals captured by distributed ground-based telescopes converted from astronomical to radar operations. From March 2021 to September 2025, we conducted systematic observations of 20 distinct rocket bodies at various orbital altitudes and object sizes. Micro-Doppler analysis of axial rotation signatures enabled extraction of rotation periods, object dimensions, surface characteristics, and mass distribution parameters with enhanced accuracy in orbital refinement. We implemented advanced imaging reconstruction techniques to generate morphology data of the targets. Results demonstrate successful determination of debris rotation periods with second-level precision, dimensional estimates within 10\\% accuracy compared to known specifications, and improved orbital parameter determination reducing position uncertainties by up to 30\\%. The technique provides a cost-effective approach for space situational awareness, leveraging existing astronomical infrastructure to enhance Australia's sovereign capabilities in tracking both near-Earth objects and space debris.

Accurate knowledge of the mapping enables complex sensing or beam control applications that leverage multimode conversion.

We provide the first multi-wavelength, polarisation decomposed characterisation of the principal modes of a photonic lantern. Performance of our testbed is validated on a single-mode fibre then harnessed to characterise a 19-port, multicore fibre fed photonic lantern. We uncover the typical wavelength scale at which the modal mapping evolves and measure the relative dispersion in the device, finding significant differences with idealised simulations. In addition to detailing the system, we also share the empirical mode transfer matrices, enabling future work in astrophotonic design, computational imaging, device fabrication feedback loops and beam shaping.",

The version of record is available online at: this https URL Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We present beam measurements of the CHIME telescope using a radio calibration source deployed on a drone payload. During test flights, the pulsing calibration source and the telescope were synchronized to GPS time, enabling in-situ background subtraction for the full $N^{2}$ visibility matrix for one CHIME cylindrical reflector. We use the autocorrelation products to estimate the primary beam width and centroid location, and compare these quantities to solar transit measurements and holographic measurements where they overlap on the sky. We find that the drone, solar, and holography data have similar beam parameter evolution across frequency and both spatial coordinates. This paper presents the first drone-based beam measurement of a large cylindrical radio interferometer. Furthermore, the unique analysis and instrumentation described in this paper lays the foundation for near-field measurements of experiments like CHIME.",

Picometer sensitive prototype of the optical truss interferometer for LISA, Classical and Quantum Gravity, 42(3), 035008 Optics (physics.optics); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The optical truss interferometer (OTI) is a contingent subsystem proposed for the LISA telescopes to aid in the verification of a $1 \\frac{\\mathrm{pm}}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}}$ optical path length stability. Each telescope would be equipped with three pairs of compact fiber-coupled units, each forming an optical cavity with a baseline proportional to the telescope length at different points around the aperture. Employing a Pound-Drever-Hall approach to maintain a modulated laser field on resonance with each cavity, the dimensional stability of the telescope can be measured and verified. We have designed and developed prototype OTI units to demonstrate the capability of measuring stable structures, such as the LISA telescope, with a $1 \\frac{\\mathrm{pm}}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}}$ sensitivity using a set of freely mountable fiber-injected cavities. Aside from its initial motivation for the telescope, the OTI can also be readily integrated with other systems to aid in ground testing experiments.

      "abstract": "Non-linear spiral waves in accretion discs Joshua J. Brown, Gordon I. Ogilvie 34 pages, 21 figures, submitted to MNRAS, comments welcome! Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We derive a simple, accurate, non-linear, global equation governing spiral density waves in thin, non-self-gravitating, inviscid accretion discs. These discs may have any slowly varying surface density or temperature profile. For specific 'self-similar' disc profiles, solutions to our equation match (novel) smooth non-linear exact spiral solutions derived via a separate method, which highlight that non-linear spiral waves need not shock. Indeed, at low amplitudes, we find that dispersion can overcome wave steepening, and may prevent the inner spiral wakes excited by low mass planets (below roughly 1% of a thermal mass) embedded in protoplanetary discs from shocking. At high amplitudes, we find a simple universal description of non-linear spiral waves with shocks, as well as caps on the possible amplitude and wave action flux of non-linear spirals both with and without shocks, depending on how many arms they have. We further find that highly non-linear spirals are far more loosely wound than their linear counterparts. These developments shed light on why two-armed spirals are prevalent across a range of astrophysical systems which don't necessarily possess an intrinsic twofold symmetry, and why they appear surprisingly loosely wound in observations. These results are supported by very high-resolution numerical simulations.",

Using first-principles molecular dynamics and thermodynamic integration, we quantify hydrogen and helium partitioning between molten silicate mantles and metallic cores for Earth-to-Neptune-mass planets. Hydrogen becomes strongly siderophilic above $\\sim$25 GPa but weakens beyond $\\sim$200 GPa, whereas helium remains lithophilic yet increasingly soluble in metal with pressure. Incorporating these trends into coupled structure-chemistry models suggests that majority of hydrogen and helium reside in planetary interiors, not atmospheres, with abundances strongly depending on planet mass. Such volatile exchange may influence the redox states of secondary atmospheres, longevity of primordial envelopes, predicted CHNOPS abundances, and emergence of helium-enriched atmospheres, while He 1083 nm and H Lyman-$\\alpha$ lines provide potential probes of atmosphere-interior exchange. These findings link atomic-scale interactions to planetary-scale observables, providing new constraints on the origins of Earth-to-Neptune-sized worlds.",

Kurtovic, Marcelo Barraza-Alfaro, Paola Pinilla 10 pages, 9 figures, (1 page appendix, 1 figure), accepted for publication in mnras Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Observations of circumbinary discs reveal inner cavities, with their shape and size varying strongly between different systems. The structure of the cavity is determined by the complex interplay between spirals induced by tidal forcing from the binary and the viscous and radiative damping of the spirals at the cavity edge. To fully understand what determines the properties of observed cavities, it is therefore necessary to capture the effect of radiative processes in modelling. To this end, we run 27 simulations of circumbinary discs in 2D using the PLUTO code. These simulations include various size scales, binary eccentricities and thermodynamic models. We find that the diverse cavity shapes are a natural outcome of the radially-varying cooling timescale, as different radiative processes mediate cooling at different disc size regimes. For binaries with separation of a few au, where the cooling timescale is comparable to the orbital timescale at the cavity edge, we recover much more circular cavities than for quickly- or slowly-cooling discs. Our results show that the cavity structure around several binary systems such as Cs Cha and GG Tau can be explained with one physical model, and highlight the importance of radiative cooling in modelling the dynamical evolution of circumbinary discs.",

In contrast, no rings have been observed around any inner Solar System objects. To constrain the dynamical origin of this ringed-versus-ringless dichotomy, we employ a numerically cross-checked analytical model of gigayear-scale Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag due to the solar flux acting on an isolated particle, expressed as a function of the host body's heliocentric distance \\(\\,a_{\\mathrm{pla}}\\) and the particle radius \\(\\,r_{\\mathrm{par}}\\). Here we show that, in the absence of additional perturbations, PR drag alone can explain the observed ring architecture of the Solar System: outer planets and Centaurs/TNOs are able to retain rings for the age of the Solar System, whereas any rings around the inner planets are removed on much shorter timescales. Because the PR-drag lifetime scales steeply with heliocentric distance \\(\\bigl(\\tau_{\\mathrm{decay}}\\propto a_{\\mathrm{pla}}^{2} \\,r_{\\mathrm{par}}\\bigr)\\), we predict that forthcoming surveys will reveal an ever-growing population of ring-bearing bodies in the distant Solar System.",

Australasian tektites from Southeast Asia and Australia, as well as microtektites recovered from deep sea sediments and Antarctica, are established to be derived from upper continental crust sediments. An expedition to retrieve remnants of bolide CNEOS 2014 January 8 (IM1), held in the Pacific Ocean, was in proximity to the known extent of the Australasian strewn field, and yielded \"BeLaU\"-spherules, whose compositions did not match most well-studied solar system material. We therefore report precise and comprehensive elemental data for Australasian tektites to compare their elemental abundances to those of microtektites from deep sea sediments, and BeLaU. Our findings corroborate previous studies that Australasian tektites and microtektites closely resemble the elemental abundance patterns of the upper continental crust. Meanwhile, the elemental patterns of the BeLaU-spherules are distinct from the Australasian tektite/microtektite compositions.",

Nitrogen (N)-bearing molecules have been chemically identified in some Ryugu grains, and based on the faint 3.06 um absorption band observed by the hyperspectral microscope MicrOmega, NH-bearing compounds appear to be globally distributed. However, the chemical forms of these NH-bearing compounds - whether organic molecules, ammonium (NH4+) salts, NH4+- or NH-organic-bearing phyllosilicates, or other forms - remain to be clarified. We report the characterization of two Ryugu particles (C0050 and C0052) using infrared spectroscopy at millimeter, micrometer, and nanometer scales, combined with NanoSIMS to constrain the nature and origin of NH-bearing components. Ryugu's C0052 particle contains rare (~1 vol.%) micrometer-sized NH-rich organic compounds with peaks at 1660 cm-1 (C=O stretching, amide I) and 1550 cm-1 (N-H bending, amide II), indicative of amides, absent in C0050. N isotopic analysis shows these amides are depleted in 15N (d15N ~ -200 permil), confirming their indigenous origin. The amides may have formed by hydrothermal alteration of carboxylic acids and amines on Ryugu's parent body or by irradiation of 15N-depleted N-bearing ice in the outer Solar System or interstellar medium. Such amides delivered by primitive small bodies may have contributed to prebiotic chemistry on early Earth.",

Koll, Feng Ding 20 pages, 9 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in ApJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Hycean planets are hypothetical exoplanets characterized by $H_2O$ oceans and $H_2$-rich atmospheres. These planets are high-priority targets for biosignature searches, as they combine abundant surface liquid water with easy-to-characterize $H_2$-rich atmospheres. Perhaps their most unusual climate feature is convective inhibition, which can dramatically alter a planet's temperature structure. However, so far hycean planets have mostly been investigated using 1D models that do not account for convective inhibition, and its effects are still poorly understood. This work develops pen-and-paper theory to analyze the effects of moist convective inhibition on hycean planets. The theory is tested and verified against a 1D radiative-convective model. We show that hycean planets near the onset of convective inhibition can exhibit either bistability or oscillations, due to the inhibition layer's trapping of heat and moisture. Meanwhile, hot hycean planets exhibit multistability, in which the inhibition layer and surface climate show multiple stable equilibria due to the lack of constraints on the water cycle inside the inhibition layer. The water cycle inside the inhibition layer is influenced by numerous processes that are challenging to resolve in 1D, including turbulent diffusion, convective overshoot and large-scale circulations. Our results demonstrate that hycean planets have unexpectedly rich climate dynamics. Meanwhile, previous claims about hycean planets should be treated with caution until confirmed with more self-consistent 1D and 3D models; this includes the claim that K2-18b might be habitable, and the proposal to infer $H_2O$ oceans on sub-Neptunes from JWST measurements of chemical species in their upper atmospheres.",
