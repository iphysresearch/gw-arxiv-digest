Many are anticipated to be detectable hours to weeks before coalescence. We present a fast algorithm for the pre-merger detection and preliminary characterization of such binaries. The method performs a search for excess power with a chirping time-frequency morphology in short-time Fourier transform spectrograms. By tiling the time-frequency plane with slices defined by the quadrupole frequency evolution, we define a signal significance relative to a fitted background distribution of instrumental noise and Galactic foreground. Individual search triggers are followed by a coherence tracker, which groups over time triggers consistent with the same physical signal . Doing so, our analysis provides progressively refined estimates of the chirp mass and coalescence time. We validate our algorithm on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset, successfully detecting all 15 injected MBHBs: 14 of them hours-to-weeks before merger, while one is only detected after the binary coalescence. The algorithm yields chirp mass relative errors below $3\\%$ for high-SNR sources and coalescence time uncertainties of up to a few hours. With a computational cost of less than a second to process a 10-day data segment on single core, our approach is suitable for generating real-time alerts, trigger protected observational periods, and provide informative priors for Bayesian parameter estimation.",

We calculate the expected GWB anisotropies using empirically calibrated models for the merger rates of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The anisotropies reflect both shot-noise in the discrete SMBHB populations while also tracing, in part, the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. The shot-noise term is sensitive to the high-mass end of the merging SMBH mass function, depends somewhat on the low-redshift tail of the merger distribution, and is a strong function of observing frequency. The precise frequency dependence provides a test of SMBHB residence times. In our models, the mean shot-noise anisotropy typically lies close to or above the broad frequency-band NANOGrav upper limits. Consequently, near-future PTA data, and potentially re-analyses of existing measurements using frequency-dependent shot-noise anisotropy templates, should be capable of detecting this signal or placing meaningful constraints on SMBHB merger models. A full interpretation, however, will require modeling the probability distribution of shot-noise amplitudes rather than relying solely on ensemble-averaged predictions. The LSS-induced anisotropies are at least two to three orders of magnitude smaller. Although the LSS contribution contains valuable information regarding the redshift distribution and clustering bias of the merging SMBHBs, detecting this component will be challenging.",

Medvedev 12 pages, 5 figures, in press in Journal of Plasma Physics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) A theory of the spectral \"zebra\" pattern of the Crab pulsar's high-frequency interpulse (HFIP) radio emission is developed. The observed emission bands are interference maxima caused by multiple ray propagation through the pulsar magnetosphere. The high-contrast interference pattern is the combined effect of gravitational lensing and plasma de-lensing of light rays. The model enables space-resolved tomography of the pulsar magnetosphere, yielding a radial plasma density profile of $n_{e}\\propto r^{-3}$, which agrees with theoretical insights. We predict the zebra pattern trend to change at a higher frequency when the ray separation becomes smaller than the pulsar size. This frequency is predicted to be in the range between 42 GHz and 650 GHz, which is within the reach of existing facilities like ALMA and SMA. These observations hold significant importance and would contribute to our understanding of the magnetosphere. Furthermore, they offer the potential to investigate gravity in the strong field regime near the star's surface.",

The time of arrival (TOA) data of white noise for 68 pulsars are analyzed regarding their KSP properties. The analysis enables to obtain the degree of randomness of the white noise for various pulsars and to reveal its inhomogeneity, i.e. pulsars with low and high randomness of the white noise. The time-dependence of the randomness in the white noise is also studied, indicating the existence of non-stationary physical processes influencing the pulsar timing. The KSP thus is acting as an indicator for the degree of the agreement between the observations and the timing models and as a test in revealing the contribution of various physical processes in the stochastic background signal.",

Here we report a deep, multiband search with the new 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST), covering about 64% of the localization region up to a 5-sigma limiting magnitude of 23 mag. In total, 12 potential candidates have been identified while none of them are likely related to S250206dm. This non-detection provides the most stringent constraint to date on any associated kilonova. Crucially, an AT 2017gfo-like event at 269 Mpc can be excluded by WFST observations alone. Based on ejecta mass limits, a neutron star-black hole with a large mass ratio (Q >= 3.2) is disfavored. This optical-derived constraint on the mass ratio reaches, for the first time, a precision comparable to that inferred from the GW signal. This work presents the best observation of this type of events until now, and demonstrates the power of rapid, deep follow-up observations to constrain the properties of compact binary progenitors, offering key insights into the constituents of the mass gap.",

      "abstract": "Cosmic voids evolution in modified gravity via hydrodynamics Tommaso Moretti, Noemi Frusciante, Giovanni Verza, Francesco Pace Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We present a hydrodynamical description of spherical void evolution in modified gravity (MG), extending the standard General Relativity (GR) and dynamical dark energy treatment by encoding gravity modifications into effective couplings that enter the Euler and Poisson equations. This yields a compact non-linear evolution equation for the Eulerian density contrast, controlled by a time- and density-dependent effective gravitational strength, and provides a direct map between model functions and void observables. We apply the framework to the luminal Galileon class of models, where derivative self-interactions generate Vainshtein screening and might lead to a breakdown of the physical branch in sufficiently underdense regions. Exploiting this feature, we apply the void-informed viability requirement that translates into bounds on the theory parameter space and, equivalently, on the minimum attainable void depth as a function of redshift. For viable parameters of a concrete model, we quantify the impact of MG on isolated void evolution, the Lagrangian to Eulerian mapping, and the shell-crossing threshold. Relative to GR, we find a clear hierarchy of MG effects, with ${\\cal O}(10\\%)$ modifications in the gravitational couplings, percent-level shifts in the void density evolution, and sub-percent deviations in both the mapping and the shell-crossing thresholds. Moreover, within the adopted parametrization, we show analytically that voids always lie in an unscreened regime on the physical branch. Overall, the formalism provides a self-consistent route to predict void dynamics and consistency constraints in a broad class of MG models.",

In quantitative reheating analyses, inflationary observables depend sensitively on the number of e-folds between horizon exit and the end of inflation, $N_k$, whose determination relies on slow-roll approximations near the end of inflation. Since inflation ends when the first slow-roll parameter reaches unity, even modest inaccuracies in this approximation can shift the end of inflation and thereby alter $N_k$, leading to modifications in predicted observables -- including those evaluated at leading order. While such effects are implicit in standard treatments, their quantitative impact on observable constraints has not been systematically assessed. In this work, we first re-evaluate leading-order slow-roll predictions using an improved determination of $N_k$ within a simple quantitative reheating framework, and then incorporate higher-order slow-roll corrections consistently with the revised background evolution. Applying this framework to the Starobinsky model, we find that improved end-of-inflation dynamics alone can induce shifts of order $\\Delta n_s \\sim 10^{-3}$, while higher-order slow-roll corrections provide additional refinements at the $\\sim 4 \\times 10^{-4}$ level. The cumulative effect results in a maximum shift of $\\Delta n_s \\sim 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}$ within the allowed reheating range. These results demonstrate that an accurate determination of the end of inflation is essential for precision tests of inflationary models.",

Palacios-Córdoba, César A. Valenzuela-Toledo Accepted for publication in Physical Review D Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate the cosmological implications of Tsallis entropy in two widely discussed frameworks: the Cai-Kim thermodynamic derivation of the Friedman equations and the Tsallis holographic dark energy (HDE) scenario, considering both the Hubble scale and the Granda-Oliveros (GO) cutoff as infrared regulators. In both cases, the dynamics introduce a nonextensivity parameter $\\delta$, with the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area relation recovered for $\\delta = 1$. While previous studies have suggested that only small deviations from extensivity are observationally allowed, typically requiring $|1 - \\delta| \\lesssim 10^{-3}$, here we go further and perform a systematic consistency analysis across the entire expansion history. We show that even mild departures from $\\delta = 1$ lead to pathological behavior in the effective dark energy sector: its density can become negative or complex, its equation of state may diverge, or it can contribute an unacceptably large early-time fraction that spoils radiation domination and violates BBN and CMB constraints. Our results sharpen and unify earlier hints of tension, providing a clear physical interpretation in terms of corrections that grow uncontrollably with the expansion rate toward the past. We conclude that within both the Cai-Kim and HDE formulations, a viable cosmology emerges only in the extensive limit, effectively reducing the models to $\\Lambda$CDM. More broadly, our findings emphasize the importance of dynamical consistency and cosmological viability tests, when assessing nonextensive entropy formalisms as potential frameworks for describing the Universe's dynamics.",

This parameterization recovers $\\Lambda$CDM and introduces two additional terms, $\\Omega_1(1+z)$ and $\\Omega_2(1+z)^2$, in the dark energy sector alongside the cosmological constant, leading to a physically interpretable and observationally testable effective dark energy dynamics. Using Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, we find that the model allows additional freedom in the late-time expansion history while preserving standard early-universe physics. When DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data are included, the inferred Hubble constant is $H_0 = 69.74 \\pm 0.77~\\mathrm{km\\;s^{-1}\\;Mpc^{-1}}$ (68% CL), consistent with Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) measurements from the Carnegie--Chicago Hubble Program (CCHP).

A natural step in extending inference pipelines to other summary statistics is to include higher order N-point correlation functions (NPCFs), which are computationally expensive and difficult to model. At the same time it is unclear how many NPCFs one would have to include to reasonably exhaust the cosmological information in the observable fields. An efficient alternative is given by learned and optimized summary statistics, largely driven by overparametrization through neural networks. This, however, largely abandons our physical intuition on the NPCF formalism and information extraction becomes opaque to the practitioner. We design a simulation-based inference pipeline, that not only benefits from the efficiency of machine learned summaries through optimization, but also holds on to the NPCF program. We employ the heavily constrained Cosmological Correlator Convolutional Neural Network (C3NN) which extracts summary statistics that can be directly linked to a given order NPCF. We present an application of our framework to simulated lensing convergence maps and study the information content of our learned summary at various orders in NPCFs for this idealized example.

Fortunato, Surajit Kalita, Amanda Weltman Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We test the Etherington cosmic distance-duality relation (CDDR), by comparing Type Ia supernova (SNIa) luminosity-distance information from the Pantheon+ compilation with an angular-diameter-distance reconstructed from localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The core of our methodology is a data-driven reconstruction from FRBs using artificial neural networks (ANNs): we infer a smooth mean extragalactic dispersion-measure relation and use its redshift derivative to recover $H(z)$ and hence $D_\\mathrm{A}^{\\rm FRB}(z)$ without assuming a parametric form for the expansion history. Possible deviations from CDDR are parameterized through three one-parameter models of $\\eta(z)\\equiv D_\\mathrm{L}/[(1+z)^2D_\\mathrm{A}]$. We implement two complementary likelihoods: (i) a direct approach using individual SNIa with the full Pantheon+ covariance, and (ii) a machine-learning approach in which we reconstruct the SN Hubble diagram on the FRB redshift grid, propagating SN and FRB uncertainties into non-diagonal covariance matrices via Monte Carlo and bootstrap realizations. Within the FRB reconstruction, we anchor the mean extragalactic dispersion measure at $z=0$, which yields a data-driven constraint on the average host/near-source contribution $\\mathrm{DM}_{\\rm host}=128.8\\pm 34.1\\,\\mathrm{pc\\,cm^{-3}}$ ($3\\sigma$ of statistical confidence). We find that both likelihood implementations give consistent posteriors and no statistically significant evidence for departures from CDDR at the current precision.",

Sethi, Akash Kumar Patwa Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The 21 cm bispectrum (BS) offers a powerful probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), but its observational access is severely hindered by dominant astrophysical foregrounds. Considering Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) observations at $154.2~\\mathrm{MHz}$ ($z=8.2$), we mitigate the foregrounds with Smooth Component Filtering (SCF) and estimate the 21 cm BS. We validate the pipeline using a simulated 21 cm signal and show that the input BS is recovered for modes $k_{\\parallel} \\ge [k_\\parallel]_f=0.135~{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Applied to actual data, the SCF produces substantial foreground suppression, reducing the amplitude of the cylindrical BS $B(k_{1\\perp},k_{2\\perp},k_{3\\perp},k_{1\\parallel},k_{2\\parallel})$ by $3-4$ orders of magnitude. The artifacts due to the missing frequency channels in the data are also suppressed. The resulting EoR window is significantly cleaner at small $k_{\\perp}$. We adopt the region $(k_{1 \\perp},k_{2 \\perp},k_{3 \\perp})\\leq 0.026~{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $(k_{1\\parallel},k_{2\\parallel},k_{3\\parallel})>0.135~{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ to evaluate the 3D spherical BS and constrain the EoR signal. By combining estimates over all triangle shapes, we place the lower and upper limits on the mean cube brightness temperature fluctuations $\\Delta^3$. The estimates are consistent with statistical fluctuations from system noise. The most stringent lower limit $\\Delta^3_{\\rm LL}=-(1.25\\times 10^4)^3~{\\rm mK}^3$ and upper limit $\\Delta^3_{\\rm UL}=(1.22\\times 10^4)^3~{\\rm mK}^3$ are obtained at $k_1=0.281~{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Additional observing time will reduce the noise level and enable substantially tighter constraints on the EoR signal.",

Some of that noise is correlated between neighbouring image pixels and exposures, so in principle could be learned and corrected. We present an astronomical self-supervised transformer-based denoising algorithm (ASTERIS), that integrates spatiotemporal information across multiple exposures. Benchmarking on mock data indicates that ASTERIS improves detection limits by 1.0 magnitude at 90% completeness and purity, while preserving the point spread function and photometric accuracy. Observational validation using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Subaru telescope identifies previously undetectable features, including low-surface-brightness galaxy structures and gravitationally-lensed arcs. Applied to deep JWST images, ASTERIS identifies three times more redshift > 9 galaxy candidates, with rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity 1.0 magnitude fainter, than previous methods.",

The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, sourced by hot electrons in high-density environments, measures the thermal pressure of the target objects, shedding light on halo thermodynamics and galaxy formation and providing a path toward understanding the baryon distribution around cosmic structures. We use a combination of high-resolution CMB maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and photometric luminous red galaxy (LRG) catalogues from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to measure the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signal in four redshift bins from $z=0.4$ to $z=1.2$, with a combined detection significance of 19$\\sigma$ when stacking on the fiducial CMB Compton-$y$ map. We discuss possible sources of contamination, finding that residual dust emission associated with the target galaxies is important and limits current analyses. We discuss several mitigation strategies and quantify the residual modelling uncertainty. This work complements closely related measurements of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and weak lensing of the same galaxies.",

We present new constraints on the SIDM cross section from the galaxy cluster MACS J0138-2155, host to the strongly lensed supernovae Requiem and Encore. Our analysis combines strong gravitational lensing with spatially resolved stellar kinematics of the central galaxy, employing several methodological advances over previous cluster-scale SIDM studies. The result is a self-consistent measurement of the density profile of MACS J0138-2155 across two orders of magnitude in radius. Our lensing and kinematics analyses individually yield highly consistent results, and from their combination we report a 95% confidence upper limit on the SIDM cross section of $\\sigma/m < 0.613$ cm$^2$/g, at an interaction velocity of $\\langle v_\\text{pair}\\rangle < 2090$ km/s. This constraint, derived from the most detailed single-system analysis to date, is competitive with previous cluster-scale limits while demonstrating the power of combining complementary gravitational probes. The methodology developed here advances precision cluster lens modeling and will inform future studies of dark matter physics, as well as time-delay cosmography in this unique strong lensing system. Additionally, our results imply SN Requiem will reappear sooner than previously reported, with a 1$\\sigma$ CL between January 2027 and November 2028 at H$_0 = 67.7$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.",

      "abstract": "Detecting the hidden population of low-mass haloes in strong lenses Conor M. O'Riordan Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) A generic prediction of particle dark matter theories is that a large population of dark matter substructures should reside inside the host haloes of galaxies. In gravitational imaging, strong gravitational lens observations are used to detect individual objects from this population, if they are large enough to perturb the strongly lensed images. We show here that low-mass haloes, below the individually detectable mass limit, have a detectable effect on the lensed images when in large numbers, which is the case in cold dark matter (CDM). We find that, in CDM, this population causes an excess of 40 per cent in the number of detected subhaloes for HST-like strong lens observations. We propose a pseudo-mass function to describe this population, and fit for its parameters from the detection data. We find that it mostly consists of objects two orders of magnitude in mass below the detection limit of individual objects. We show that including this modification, so that the effect of the population is correctly predicted, can improve the available constraints on dark matter from strong lens observations. We repeat our experiments using models that contain varying amounts of angular structure in the lens galaxy. We find that these multipole perturbations are degenerate with the population signal. This further highlights the need for better understanding of the angular mass structure of lens galaxies, so that the maximum information can be extracted from strong lens observations for dark matter inference.",

ULDM is based on exceptionally light particles and yields galactic halos with dense central solitons. This increases the drag experienced by binary SMBH, decreasing merger times and potentially suppressing gravitational radiation from the binary at low frequencies. We develop semi-analytic models for the decay of SMBH binaries in ULDM halos and use current pulsar timing array (PTA) measurements to constrain the ULDM particle mass and its fractional contribution to the dark matter content of the universe. We find a median ULDM particle mass of $7. \\times 10^{-22}$ eV and show that scaling relations suggest that the drag remains effective at relatively low ULDM fractions, which are consistent with all other constraints on the model. Consequently, future pulsar timing measurements will be a sensitive probe of any ULDM contribution to the overall dark matter content of the universe.",

Published in Physical Review D (13 February 2026) Phys. Rev. D 113, 043516 (2026) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Motivated by recent claims of a possible redshift dependence in late-Universe determinations of the Hubble constant (H_0), we test the robustness of this behavior using multiple cosmological probes. We perform a joint redshift-binned analysis of H_0 across eight bins using late-Universe probes including Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic chronometers, and water megamasers under three cosmological frameworks: flat Lambda cold dark matter, Chevallier-Polarski-Linder, and Pade cosmography. Under a common baseline scheme, all three models show a qualitatively similar low-amplitude variation in the per-bin H_0 estimates. A simple Fourier-like parametrization captures this behavior, but the amplitude differs from zero only at a marginal significance of about 1.71-1.94 sigma, with similar behavior observed across all three cosmological frameworks. We then investigate the robustness and possible origin of this feature. Alternative binning schemes preserve its qualitative form, whereas single-probe per-bin fits (supernova-only, cosmic chronometer-only, BAO-only) yield ratios H_0,i / H_0,global mostly consistent with unity and do not reproduce the pronounced drift seen in the joint baseline constraints. Finally, by comparing different global versus piecewise-constant configurations for {H_0, Omega_m, M, r_d}, we find that a baselinelike oscillatory pattern reemerges only when multiple degenerate parameter combinations are allowed to vary across bins, while it is strongly suppressed when only H_0 is bin dependent. Taken together, these results indicate that the apparent oscillatory behavior of H_0(z) in late time arises from known parameter degeneracies and does not constitute robust evidence for a genuine redshift evolution.",

These observations use 6-7 years of photometric and spectroscopic observations of 735 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the redshift range 0.13-3.85 and bolometric luminosity range 44.3 - 47.5 erg/s. Both photometry and spectra are observed in visible wavelengths, allowing for the physical scale of the AGN broad line region to be estimated from reverberations of the H\\b{eta}, MgII and CIV emission lines. We successfully use reverberation mapping to constrain the masses of 62 super-massive black holes, and combine with existing data to fit a power law to the lag-luminosity relation for the H\\b{eta} and MgII lines with a scatter of ~0.25 dex, the tightest yet identified, fit specifically for consistency with high redshift AGN. We fit a similarly constrained relation for CIV, resolving a tension with the low luminosity literature AGN by accounting for selection effects arising from finite survey length. We also examine the impact of emission line width and luminosity (related to accretion rate) in reducing the scatter of these scaling relationships and find no significant improvement over the lag-only approach for any of the three lines. Using these relations, we further estimate the masses and accretion rates of 246 AGN with single epoch methods. We also use these relations to estimate the relative sizes of the H\\b{eta}, MgII and CIV emitting regions. In short, we provide a comprehensive benchmark of high redshift AGN reverberation mapping at the close of this most recent generation of surveys, including light curves, time-delays, and a set of significantly improved radius-luminosity relations for use with high-redshift populations.",

Burdge, Jorge Cuadra, Margherita Giustini, Lorena Hernández-García, Erin Kara, Paula Sánchez-Sáez, Philippe Yao High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We report the first direct measurement of the period derivative in a quasi-periodic eruption (QPE), finding a smoothly increasing period with $\\dot{P}\\approx (1.7\\pm 0.02)\\times10^{-2}$ d d$^{-1}$ in the source ZTF19acnskyy/\"Ansky\". Most models for QPEs invoke repeated interactions of a stellar-mass orbiting companion around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI). In these scenarios, a positive $\\dot{P}$ is surprising, but not impossible to produce. We explore several possible explanations for the observed $\\dot{P}$, including stable mass-transfer driven by impulsive mass loss events in an EMRI, velocity kicks at pericenter due to tidal interactions with the SMBH, apparent period changes due either to general relativistic precession effects in an EMRI or light travel-time delays in a hierarchical SMBH binary, and mass-transfer variations in a thermal/viscous disk instability model. We find that none of the considered models provides a complete explanation for the data, motivating further work on physical explanations for positive period derivatives in QPEs.",

Zhou High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Neutrino emission from astrophysical sources has long been considered a signature of cosmic-ray acceleration. The IceCube neutrino observatory has observed a diffuse flux of TeV-PeV neutrinos, but very few confirmed sources have emerged. With the recent publication of IceCube Event Catalog (IceCat-1), IceCube has released a list of the most promising astrophysical neutrino events since May 2011. Using the archival data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) $\\gamma$-ray observatory, we perform a coincidence search for gamma rays and neutrinos using a Bayesian Block algorithm with the public IceCube alerts from IceCat-1, along with additional alerts issued later. In this work, we consider 368 alerts, up to July 8, 2025, that are within HAWC's field of view. We observe approximately a 5\\% coincident detection rate, which is consistent with expectations from background. Two of these detections contain the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) Markarian 421 and Markarian 501. We discuss the likelihood that the neutrino/$\\gamma$-ray coincidences are false positives and a brief overview of the results.",

We measure the spectral properties, power spectral densities (PSDs), fractional variability amplitudes, and energy dependence of the variability for 18 TDEs spanning 54 observations, of which 27 occur in thermal disk-dominated states and 27 show a nonthermal hard X-ray corona. Compared to pure thermal sources, we find TDEs with coronae are more X-ray variable and show steeper PSDs indicating longer correlation timescales. This state-transition behavior is qualitatively similar to X-ray binaries, which show higher fractional variability in the hard state than in the soft state. However, newborn TDE coronae show systematically flatter PSDs and softer energy spectra than their long-lived AGN counterparts. We also show that the variability amplitude of thermal TDEs increases with photon energy, consistent with variations sourced by local temperature fluctuations and exponentially enhanced in the Wien tail. Our work demonstrates that combining spectral and timing properties of X-ray TDEs can probe the microphysics of newly formed accretion flows around supermassive black holes, and that the coronae formed in TDEs fundamentally differ from those in AGN.",

The discovery magnitude of the 16 WFST-PS early-phase SNe is at least 3 mag fainter than their peak brightness. A large scatter of color indices is found in approximately the first 10 days of supernova explosions, indicating diverse photometric behaviors in the early phase. Three EExSNe Ia show relatively brighter peak luminosities and longer rise time compared to those of non-EExSNe Ia. The results indicate that current theoretical models require further refinement to fully capture the early photometric evolution of SNe Ia. Based on the initial high-cadence ugr-band data from the WFST-PS survey, we emphasize that early near-ultraviolet (NUV) observations are indispensable for placing tight constraints on the explosion mechanisms and progenitor systems of SNe Ia.",

Its light curve is characterized by a peak absolute magnitude of $M_B = -18.49 \\pm 0.03$ mag and a decline rate of $\\Delta m_{15}(B) = 1.53 \\pm 0.36$ mag, placing the object on the $\\Delta m_{15}(B)$--$M_B$ diagram in the transition region between normal and subluminous SNe Ia. Furthermore, the early-color evolution and host galaxy environment of SN 2024aedt underscore its transitional nature, sharing properties with both normal and 91bg-like SNe Ia. Light-curve modeling with MOSFiT yields a synthesized $^{56}\\mathrm{Ni}$ mass of $0.414 \\pm 0.042\\,M_{\\odot}$ and a total ejecta mass of $0.548 \\pm 0.108\\,M_{\\odot}$. A comparison with theoretical models suggests that the evolutionary trend can be broadly explained by both delayed-detonation (DDT) and double-detonation (DDet) scenarios while possible early-excess emissions predicted by DDet cannot be identified given the limited detections soon after the SN explosion. Although the overall spectral evolution of SN 2024aedt is similar to that of other transitional SNe Ia, the spectroscopic comparison reveals diversity in the early-phase blue-end features, which becomes more homogeneous at later phases. The result indicates the importance of early-time observations in understanding the origin of SN Ia diversity.",

By jointly employing an analytic early shock-cooling model and the Arnett radioactive-diffusion model, we fit the bolometric light curves and infer ejecta masses in the range $1.1$-$2.6 M_\\odot$, consistent with a transitional population between ultra-stripped supernovae (USSNe) and normal stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe). The envelope masses are estimated to be $M_{\\rm env}=0.1$-$0.4 M_\\odot$, while the progenitors are constrained to be yellow or blue supergiants (YSGs/BSGs) with radii of $R=120$-$300 R_\\odot$. Using empirical relations, we estimate progenitor luminosities of $L=10^{4.6}$-$10^{4.9} L_\\odot$, corresponding to zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) masses of $8$-$20 M_\\odot$. Theoretical models suggest that such progenitors are more naturally produced through binary evolution channels, as single-star evolutionary pathways are unable to yield ejecta masses this low.",

The method directly discretizes the kinetic equation on a high-dimensional phase-space grid using a discontinuous Galerkin finite element approach, yielding a high-order, conservative numerical scheme that is free from the Poisson noise inherent to traditional Monte-Carlo methods. A novel and flexible velocity-space mapping technique enables the efficient treatment of the wide range of energy scales characteristic of relativistic plasmas, including QED pair-production discharges, instabilities in strongly magnetized plasmas surrounding neutron stars, and relativistic magnetic reconnection. Our noise-free approach is capable of providing unique insight into plasma dynamics, enabling detailed analysis of electromagnetic emission and fine-scale phase-space structure.",

Lu Submitted; 28 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Seyfert galaxy Markarian 590 offers a rare glimpse into the dynamic life cycle of black hole accretion, captured across multiple wavelengths from the years 1975 to 2025. Using the decade-long multi-band observations from the Swift observatory, we capture a clear spectral state transition analogous to those seen in X-ray binaries but seldom observed in a single AGN. We track a complete AGN state transition in real time, as the source evolves from a faint, hard X-ray state to a bright, UV- and soft X-ray dominated phase. The X-ray loudness parameter $\\alpha_{ox}$ follows a pronounced 'V'-shaped dependence on Eddington ratio $\\lambda_{Edd}$, with a break at $\\lambda_{Edd}$ = 0.021 +/- 0.008, coinciding with thresholds identified in population studies of changing-look quasars and X-ray binaries. Across this transition, Mkn 590 evolves through distinct accretion regimes in the Hardness Intensity Diagrams (HID): faint, flaring, transitional, and bright, on a timescale of $\\sim$10 years, which is well below classical viscous timescales for a geometrically thin disk but in agreement with the propagation of thermal wavefronts in the inner disk. When placed on the Fundamental Plane of black hole activity, the source broadly follows the expected radio/X-ray mass scaling, though with a 70% flatter slope, pointing towards a persistent coronal-jet coupling even in radiatively efficient states. Together, our results establish Mkn 590 as a rare, time-resolved case of AGN state transitions and offer compelling evidence for scale-invariant accretion physics across the black hole mass spectrum.",

Motivated by this behavior, we propose a source-compensated, history-dependent helicity density that satisfies an exact local balance identity by construction, enabling Saffman-type two-point correlation integrals which, under standard flux-decorrelation assumptions, can exhibit intermediate-scale plateaus that are roughly time-independent. In our simulations we demonstrate such plateaus to remain approximately invariant even as the usual Saffman helicity integral plateau value $I_H$ evolves during the early kinetic stage. Under approximate single-scale self-similarity, the plateau behavior of the magnetic integral is consistent with the 2D decay constraint $BL \\sim \\text{const}$. For initially net-helical configurations, we observe rapid development of mixed-signed magnetic helicity patches and a decrease of the global fractional helicity, such that the decay over the kinetic interval is again most consistent with the cancellation-dominated scaling constraint.",

ApJ accepted. Equal contribution by first two authors High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Long-period transients are an elusive class of compact objects uncovered by radio surveys. While magnetars are a leading candidate for those sources that appear isolated, several observational properties challenge the established evolutionary framework: (i) low quiescent X-ray luminosities, (ii) $\\sim$hour-long rotational periods, and (iii) highly-variable radio flux. It is shown via magnetothermal modelling that, if electric currents thread the fluid core at the time of crust freezing, the neutron star remains multiband silent for an initial period of approximately 0.1 Myr while cooling passively. Once the crust becomes cold enough, the Hall effect begins to dominate the magnetic evolution, triggering crustal failures that inject magnetospheric twist that initiates radio pulsing while depleting rotational kinetic energy from an already-slow star. Depending on where electric currents circulate, such 'late-blooming' magnetars manifesting as long-period transients may thus form a distinct branch from soft gamma repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars.",

Plasma Phys. 92 (1), E10 (2026) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Relativistic magnetic reconnection has been proposed as an important nonthermal particle acceleration (NTPA) mechanism that generates power-law spectra and high-energy emissions. Power-law particle spectra are in general characterized by three parameters: the power-law index, the high-energy cutoff, and the low-energy cutoff (i.e., the injection energy). Particle injection into the nonthermal power law, despite also being a critical step in the NTPA chain, has received considerably less attention than the subsequent acceleration to high energies. Open questions on particle injection that are important for both physical understanding and astronomical observations include how the upstream magnetization~$\\sigma$ influences the injection energy and the contributions of the known injection mechanisms (i.e., direct acceleration by the reconnection electric field, Fermi kicks, and pickup acceleration) to the injected particle population. Using fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we uncover these relationships by systematically measuring the injection energy and calculating the contributions of each acceleration mechanism to the total injected particle population. We also present a theoretical model to explain these results. Additionally, we compare two- and three-dimensional simulations to assess the impact of the flux-rope kink and drift-kink instability on particle injection. We conclude with comparisons with previous work and outlook for future work.",

Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (ULGRBs), a rare class of high-energy transients with durations $>10^3$s, remain poorly understood. GRB 250702B is notable for its multi-hour prompt emission, an X-ray pre-peak emission starting $\\sim$1 day earlier, off-nuclear host position, and hard, rapidly variable gamma-rays. This combination is difficult to explain with standard ULGRB progenitors such as blue-supergiant collapsars, magnetar engines, or white-dwarf tidal disruptions by intermediate-mass black holes. We interpret the event as a micro-tidal disruption event ($\\mu$TDE), where a stellar-mass black hole or neutron star partially or fully disrupts a main-sequence star. Three $\\mu$TDE pathways can reproduce the observed pre-peak emission to main flare delay: (i) a dynamical (partial/repeating) disruption, in which a grazing passage yields a faint precursor and the core returns after $\\sim$day for a deeper encounter; (ii) a natal-kick disruption, where the delay reflects the ballistic motion of a newborn compact object relative to its companion, leading to full disruption; and (iii) a hybrid natal-kick + partial case, in which the kick seeds the close encounter but the first passage is only partial, with the core returning on the day-scale period. Cross-section scalings imply comparable rates for partial and full outcomes in both dynamical and natal-kick scenarios. The highly variable, hard $\\gamma$-ray emission supports association with a stellar-mass compact object. Fallback and viscous accretion naturally explain the ultra-long duration, energetics, and ks-scale X-ray variability. We outline observational discriminants between the three channels and argue that $\\mu$TDEs offer a compelling framework for ULGRBs such as GRB 250702B.",

To be submitted to MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Rapid localisation and follow-up of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) increasingly rely on low-latency triggers from new missions coupled to wide-field robotic optical facilities. We present the discovery and multi-wavelength follow-up of GRB 250818B, detected by the Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) and localised optically by the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO). We compile and homogenise X-ray, optical/NIR, and radio data to build broadband light curves and spectral energy distributions. The afterglow is unusually luminous for a nominal short GRB, lying on the bright end of the short-GRB population in X-rays and optical and among the most luminous high-redshift short-GRB afterglows in the radio. MeerKAT detects the source at 3.1 GHz, while ALMA provides deep higher-frequency limits. Keck/LRIS spectroscopy shows continuum and metal absorption (Fe II, Mg II, Mg I), giving $z=1.216$. Synchrotron forward-shock modelling favours a constant-density medium and strongly prefers refreshed (energy-injection) emission, well described by a two-component jet with $E_{K,iso} \\sim 4\\times10^{52}$ erg, $n_0 \\sim 3.6$ cm$^{-3}$, $\\theta_j \\simeq 0.10$ rad ($\\sim 5.7$ deg), and $p \\simeq 1.64$. The host association is ambiguous: the nearest LS DR10 galaxy candidate ($r_{AB} \\sim 24.7$) is offset by $\\sim 4$ arcsec ($\\sim 34$ kpc) with chance-alignment probability $P_{cc} \\sim 0.2$, and current imaging does not exclude a fainter, near-coincident host. SED fitting of the candidate host suggests a low-mass galaxy. GRB 250818B highlights the power of rapid wide-field counterpart identification in the SVOM era, while host-association uncertainty can still limit offset-based interpretation.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Post-common envelope binaries (PCEBs) consisting of a white dwarf (WD) plus a main-sequence (MS) star can constrain current prescriptions of common envelope evolution (CEE) and calibrate theoretical models of binary formation and evolution. Most PCEBs studied to date have typical orbital periods of hours to a few days and can be well explained by assuming inefficient CEE to expel the envelope. However, there are currently several systems with relatively wide orbital periods ($>$18 days). To explain these wide PCEBs, additional sources of energy have been suggested to be taken into account. Here, we present the discovery and observational characterization of a compact object ($M\\,\\geq\\,0.58\\,\\rm M_{\\odot}$) with a K-type star companion in the solar neighborhood ($d\\sim 112$ pc) and an orbital period of $P_{\\rm orb}\\sim 14$ days. The compact object binary is likely to be a system consisting of a WD and a barium dwarf, making it the shortest-period barium star binary candidate. Such a system with an orbital period within the gap between tight and wide binaries provides a test of whether additional energy sources are required to explain its formation. Using binary evolution models, we investigate the evolutionary history of this wide PCEB system and find that the observed properties of this source can be explained without invoking any extra energy source.",

Comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present the results of the Exploration of Local VolumE Survey - Field (ELVES-Field), a survey of the dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume (LV; $D<10$ Mpc) over roughly $3,000$ square degrees, focusing on the field dwarf population. Candidates are detected using a semi-automated algorithm tailored for low surface brightness dwarfs. Using tests with injected galaxies, we show the detection is $50\\%$ complete to $m_g\\sim20$ mag and $M_\\star \\sim 10^6$ $M_\\odot$. Candidates are confirmed to be true nearby dwarfs through distance measurements including redshift, tip of the red giant branch, and surface brightness fluctuations. We identify isolated, field dwarfs using various environmental criteria. Over the survey footprint, we detect and confirm 95 LV dwarfs, 44 of which we consider isolated. Using this sample, we infer the field dwarf mass function and find good agreement at the high-mass end with previous redshift surveys and with the predictions of the IllustrisTNG simulation. This sample of isolated, field dwarfs represents a powerful dataset to investigate aspects of small-scale structure and the effect of environment on dwarf galaxy evolution.",

Davis, Saakshi More, Zehao Jin, Mario Pasquato, Andrea Valerio Macciò, Feng Yuan Unedited manuscript (17 pages, 7 figures, and 2 tables) accepted by The Astrophysical Journal on February 17, 2026 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The nascent methodology of applying the principles of causal discovery to astrophysical data has produced affirming results about deeply held theories concerning the causal nature behind the observed coevolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with their host galaxies. The key results from observations have demonstrated an apparent causal reversal across different galaxy morphologies$\\unicode{x2014}$SMBHs causally influence the evolution of the physical parameters of their spiral galaxy hosts, whereas SMBHs in elliptical galaxies are passive companions that grow in near lockstep with their hosts. To further explore and ascertain insights, it is necessary to utilize galaxy simulations to track the time evolution of the observed causal relations to learn more about the temporal nature of the changing SMBH/galaxy evolutionary directions. We conducted experiments with the NIHAO suite of cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamical simulations to follow the evolution of individual galaxies along with their central SMBH masses ($M_\\unicode{x25CF}$) and properties, including central stellar velocity dispersion ($\\sigma_0$). We reproduce the causal results from real galaxies, but add clarity by observing that the SMBH/galaxy causal directions are noticeably inverted between the epochs before and after the peak of star formation. The implications for causal reversal of the $M_\\unicode{x25CF}\\unicode{x2013}\\sigma_0$ relation portend larger concerns about the reliability of SMBH masses estimated at high redshifts and presumptions of overmassive black holes at early epochs. Toward this problem, we apply updated causally-informed scaling relations that predict high-$z$ black hole masses that are approximately two orders of magnitude less massive, and thus not overmassive with respect to local $z=0$ SMBH$\\unicode{x2013}$galaxy mass ratios.",

Comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Modern cosmology and galaxy formation rely on an understanding of how cosmic baryons are distributed, a significant portion of which exist in the diffuse gas confined to halos. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are a promising probe of the Universe's ionized gas. At low redshift, the contribution to the dispersion measure (DM) from the intergalactic medium (IGM) and intervening halos is subdominant, allowing us to study the circumgalactic media (CGM) of the host galaxies. We select a sample of five local universe FRBs whose host interstellar medium (ISM) DM is negligible and use these to constrain the mass of the CGM in each halo. We find that one of our sources, the only massive elliptical host galaxy, has been evacuated of its baryons ($M_\\mathrm{gas}=0.02^{+0.02}_{-0.02}M_\\mathrm{h}$, corresponding to $\\sim$10$\\%$ of the cosmological average $\\frac{\\Omega_b}{\\Omega_m}$). This galaxy shows evidence of a past episode of AGN activity, consistent with the picture of strong AGN feedback in galaxy group-scale halos. The other sources are consistent with existing multiwavelength data and tentatively support more baryon retention in $L_*$ galaxies compared to group-scale halos. We show that FRBs can measure the halo gas fraction $f_\\mathrm{gas}$ in halos of mass $M_\\mathrm{h}\\sim10^{11-13}M_\\odot$, and up to $\\sim10^{14}M_\\odot$ if galaxy cluster hosts are included, which is a larger range than other gas probes can access. Finally, we demonstrate that a large sample of local universe FRBs, such as those expected from upcoming all-sky radio telescopes, will enable precision measurements of halo gas, which is crucial for understanding the effects of feedback.",

Phadke Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present results from imaging observations of three quadruply lensed quasars by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at redshifts $z = 2.550$, 2.975, and 1.500. We model our targets assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid mass profile and an elliptical SÃ\\c{opyright}rsic profile for the lensing galaxies, and reconstruct the geometric configuration of each system with measured Einstein radii of 0.44$'$, 0.58$'$, and 0.49$'$. While no spectroscopic measurements are available for the lenses, we constrain the redshift of each lens to $0.5 < z < 1.2$, $1.0 < z < 1.5$, and $0.4 < z < 0.9$. For all three lenses, the best-fit light model yield a typical de Vaucouleurs $n_{\\rm S\\acute{e}rsic} \\sim 4$ profile and an effective radius $R_e$ around $\\sim 1.5 - 3.5$ kpc. We accordingly classify the three lenses as early-type galaxies at an intermediate to high redshift, a common type for strong lensing galaxies. Compared to other known quadruple lenses, the lensing galaxies in this work are at the lower end of the distribution of Einstein radii and upper end of the distribution of the lens redshifts. They represent an interesting quadrant of subarcsecond-separation lenses in the population of single-galaxy strong lensing which have been largely unexplored yet and will be great targets of interest in upcoming high-resolution lensing surveys.",

Heckman, Jennifer I-Hsiu Li, Zhuoqi Liu, Nishant Mishra, Kristina Nyland, Kate Rowlands, Gwen C. Rudie, Evan Schneider, Dominika Wylezalek, Nadia L. Zakamska Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is widely acknowledged to regulate the growth of massive galaxies, though its driving mechanisms are debated. Prevailing theories suggest that AGN-driven outflows are driven either by radiation pressure acting directly on the dusty interstellar medium (ISM) or by hot winds entraining cooler ISM gas, but the relative contribution of each mechanism remains uncertain. By combining optical emission line measurements with highly ionized UV emission lines, it is possible to constrain whether the pressure source applied to ionized clouds is primarily radiation or primarily hydrodynamic, and thus constrain the dominant driver. This study presents the first multi-object analysis of far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra from galactic-scale AGN-driven outflows in obscured quasars, based on Cosmic Origins Spectrograph observations of five low-redshift targets. By comparing narrow-line region UV emission line ratios to theoretical models that vary the importance of the two pressure sources, we find three out of five targets fall within the radiation pressure-dominated regime. A fourth target exhibits intermediate emission-line ratios that suggest radiation pressure and pressure from a hot wind are both dynamically important. Finally, the lowest-luminosity object in our sample may have a dynamically important hot wind component, but non-detections prevent a clear conclusion in this case. These results suggest radiation pressure dominates circum-nuclear narrow-line region cloud dynamics, but pressure from a hot wind also plays a role in some cases. This is consistent with AGN feedback scenarios mediated by radiation pressure or a short-lived hot wind phase that dissipates after initially accelerating outflows.",

Saha Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Shock chemistry is an excellent tool to shed light on the formation and destruction mechanisms of complex organic molecules (COMs). The L1157-mm outflow is the only low-mass protostellar outflow that has extensively been studied in this regard. Using the data taken as part of the PRODIGE (PROtostars & DIsks: Global Evolution) large program, we aim to map COM emission and derive the molecular composition of the protostellar outflow driven by the Class 0 protostar NGC1333 IRAS4B1 to introduce it as a new laboratory to study the impact of shocks on COM chemistry. In addition to typical outflow tracers such as SiO and CO, outflow emission is seen from H2CO, HNCO, and HC3N, as well as from the COMs CH3OH, CH3CN, and CH3CHO, and even from deuterated species such as DCN, D2CO, and CH2DOH. Maps of integrated intensity ratios between CH3OH and DCN, D2CO, and CH3CHO reveal gradients with distance from the protostar. Intensity ratio maps of HC3N and CH3CN with respect to CH3OH peak in the southern lobe where temperatures are highest. Rotational temperatures derived towards two positions, one in each lobe, are found in the range ~50-100 K. Abundances with respect to CH3OH are higher by factors of a few than for the L1157-B1. In conclusion, for the first time, we securely detected the COMs CH3CN, CH3CHO, and CH2DOH in the IRAS 4B1 outflow, serendipitously with limited sensitivity and bandwidth. Targeted observations will enable the discovery of new COMs and a more detailed analysis of their emission. Morphological differences between molecules in the IRAS 4B1 outflow lobes and their relative abundances provide first proof that this outflow is a promising new laboratory for shock chemistry, which will offer crucial information on COM formation and destruction as well as outflow structure and kinematics.",

MIDIS is the deepest JWST/MIRI survey to date, probing faint limits and enabling studies of rare high-redshift galaxy populations. We define MIRI-red sources as those detected at 5$\\sigma$ significance in MIRI/F560W with red colors: $m_{\\rm F444W} - m_{\\rm F560W} \\ge 0.5$. Using an empirical methodology, we estimate the purity and completeness of MIRI detections and find that a 5-sigma detection at 28.75 mag has a purity of 92\\% and completeness of 54\\%. We identify seven MIRI-red galaxy candidates, including an F115W dropout consistent with a high-redshift galaxy candidate. We explore possible physical origins for the MIRI-red population, including active galactic nuclei, dust-obscured galaxies, extreme emission-line galaxies, evolved stellar populations, and Little Red Dots (LRDs). Given the proximity of the F444W and F560W filters and the depth of MIDIS, MIRI-red galaxies are consistent with emission-line galaxies with $EW_0(H\\alpha) \\ge 750$ Å or $EW_0(H\\beta + [OIII]) \\ge 600$ Å, or high-redshift Balmer breaks of at least 1.6. We also discuss an extreme MIRI-red galaxy undetected in F444W, a potential MIRI-only source, for which we derive $EW_0(H\\alpha) \\sim 6000$ Å and $EW_0(H\\beta + [OIII]) \\sim 4000$ Å, or high-$z$ LRD analogs with Balmer breaks of 6.3. Finally, we find fewer MIRI-red detections than expected from extrapolations of the H$\\alpha$ or H$\\beta$+[OIII] line luminosity functions, consistent with previous deep searches, while the absence of $z>10$ LRD candidates agrees with theoretical expectations for the MIDIS volume.",

Preprint of conference proceedings to appear in Machine Learning for Astrophysics 2024, Springer Nature (eds. F. Bufano, E. Sciacca & S. Riggi) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The advent of integral field data has revolutionised the study of galaxy evolution. A key component of this is dynamical modelling methods which have allowed for crucial insights to be made from kinematic data. Despite this importance, most dynamical models make a number of key assumptions which do not hold for real galaxies. These include assumptions about the geometry (axisymmetry or triaxiality), the shape of the velocity ellipsoid, and the shape of the underlying stellar distribution. At the same time, machine learning methods are becoming increasingly powerful, with many applications appearing in astronomy. As a first step towards building new dynamical modelling methods with machine learning, it is important to understand the types of machine learning architectures that are best fit for dynamical modelling. To investigate this, we construct a training set of dynamical models of early-type galaxies using Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM). We then train a neural network on this data using the parameters of JAM and mock photometry as the input. We are able to accurately model JAM galaxies with relatively simple machine learning architectures, leading to a significant speed increase over traditional JAM modelling.",

Mérida, Vesna Pirc Jevšenak, Roberta Tripodi 9 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) UV slopes ($\\beta$) are a powerful diagnostics for galaxies at the Epoch of Reionization, tracing star formation, ISM ionization, and the escape fraction $f_{esc}$ of ionizing photons. Studies at low and intermediate z find a gradual $\\beta$ reddening with time and steeper slopes for fainter galaxies, however recent JWST studies reveal a flattening of this trend at $z>7$. We want measure $\\beta$ for galaxies at $z>7.5$ using the strong lensing around massive galaxy clusters to observe high-redshift and faint galaxies. The low-brightness regime is of particular interest for reionization, as most of the recent models of this process posit that numerous faint galaxies are the prime drivers of reionization. We use NIRCam and NIRSpec data from CANUCS, Technicolor, JUMPS, Silver Bullet, UNCOVER and MEGASCIENCE across 7 strong lensing fields. We find galaxies down to $M_{UV}\\sim-16$ and 7.5<z<12.5. We measure \\b{eta} with a forward-modelling procedure and estimate $f_{esc}$ for a subsample with emission line data using a relation, calibrated from a low-z sample, with UV slope, galaxy size and H$\\beta$ equivalent width. We find 378 galaxies (45 with spectrum), yielding average values $\\beta=-2.3\\pm0.4$, $z=8.5\\pm1.0$, and $M_{UV}=-18\\pm1$. We find no significant $\\beta$ evolution across our redshift range, suggesting a flattening of the $\\beta-z$ trend above $z\\sim7.5$. We find a weak negative trend between $\\beta$ and $M_{UV}$. For 14 galaxies we estimate an average $f_{esc}=0.26\\pm0.22$. The flat trend of $\\beta$ at $z>7.5$ suggests similar properties between $300$ and $600 Myr$ after the Big Bang. The weak trend between $\\beta$ and $M_{UV}$ suggests an analogous composition for low- and high-mass galaxies' ISM, likely due to a lack of time for dust buildup. While average $f_{esc}$ is higher than necessary to ionize the IGM by z~6, the model extrapolated at low-z may overestimate its value.",

Bovino Revised version submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The formation pathways of sulfur-bearing species in the interstellar medium are crucial to understand astrochemical processes in cold molecular clouds and to gain new insights about the sulfur budget in these regions. We aim to explore the recently detected, thioethanal (CH$_{3}$CHS) formation mechanisms from thioethanol (CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH) as a precursor in addition to secondary sulfur products. The electronic structure methods and density functional theory for both gas-phase and ice-grain surface environments is employed. To mimic interstellar ice-mantles, we use medium (W6) and large amorphized (W22) water clusters as implemented in Binding Energy Evaluation protocol. A barrierless formation mechanism for CH$_{3}$CHS under low-temperature interstellar conditions is identified, in the gas phase. Surface environments modulate activation barriers in a site-specific manner, elucidated through both Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal initiated surface reaction pathways. Compared to oxygen analogs, sulfur chemistry enables alternate pathways due to weaker S-H bonding, with a competing route forming ethane-1,1-di-thiol (CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH), on the ice-grain surface, potentially reducing CH$_{3}$CHS yields. The first accurate binding energy for thioethanol on water ice is also reported, confirming its greater volatility than ethanol. The proposed mechanism offers a tentative hypothesis for the apparent mutual exclusive detections of the CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH and CH$_{3}$CHS in TMC-1, Orion, and Sgr B2(N), that further requires validation through quantitative astrochemical modeling and also to distinguish this chemical differentiation from observational sensitivity limitations. These qualitative findings highlight the multifaceted chemical behavior of sulfur-bearing organics in the interstellar medium and support CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH as promising astro-chemical targets.",

Bouché, Joey Braspenning, Sebastiano Cantalupo, Sourav Das, Martin Wendt Submitted to ApJ. Comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate the azimuthal dependence of H I and O VI-bearing gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of 113 isolated galaxies in the redshift range 0.12 < z < 0.75, including 91 new measurements from the MUSE Quasar-fields Blind Emitters Survey (MUSEQuBES). The H I covering fraction (k_HI) within the virial radius (Rvir) of low-mass (7 < log10(M*/Msun)< 9) galaxies, for a threshold column density of log10(N(HI)/cm^-2) = 14.5, exhibits an enhancement along both the disk plane (azimuthal angle phi < 20 degree) and in the polar direction (phi > 70 degree). In contrast, such a bimodal distribution is not observed for higher mass galaxies (9 < log10(M*/Msun) < 11.3). Similarly, the O VI covering fraction (k_OVI), for a threshold of log10(N(OVI)/cm^-2) = 14.0, shows a tentative enhancement along both the projected major and minor axes for low-mass galaxies. In contrast, O VI-bearing gas around higher- mass galaxies appears more uniformly distributed, with no significant azimuthal dependence. Finally, using the halo circular-velocity-normalized pixel-velocity two-point correlation function (TPCF), we find that O VI absorbers are kinematically narrower along the disk plane compared to the polar directions of the host galaxies with similar stellar mass distributions. The observed isotropic distribution of O VI in high-mass halos suggests that its spatial distribution is governed by global halo properties; however, the O VI kinematics retain memory of the site of origin.",

Repository with spectroscopic member catalogs: this https URL. Forthcoming Paper II will explore the orbits, accretion histories, and tidal influences of the same sample Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Deep, wide-area photometric surveys have uncovered a population of compact ($r_{1/2} \\approx$ 1-15 pc), extremely-low-mass ($M_* \\approx$ 20-4000 $M_{\\odot}$) stellar systems in the Milky Way halo that are smaller in size than known ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) and substantially fainter than most classical globular clusters (GCs). Very little is known about the nature and origins of this population of \"Ultra-Faint Compact Satellites\" (UFCSs) owing to a dearth of spectroscopic measurements. Here, we present the first spectroscopic census of these compact systems based on Magellan/IMACS and Keck/DEIMOS observations of 19 individual UFCSs, representing $\\sim$2/3 of the known population. We securely measure mean radial velocities for all 19 systems, velocity dispersions for 15 (predominantly upper limits), metallicities for 17, metallicity dispersions for 8, and $\\textit{Gaia}$-based mean proper motions for 18. This large new spectroscopic sample provides the first insights into population-level trends for these extreme satellites. We demonstrate that: (1) the UFCSs are kinematically colder, on average, than the UFDs, disfavoring very dense dark matter halos in most cases, (2) the UFCS population is chemically diverse, spanning a factor of $\\sim$300 in mean iron abundance ($\\rm -3.3 \\lesssim [Fe/H] \\lesssim -0.8$), with multiple systems falling beneath the \"metallicity floor\" proposed for GCs, and (3) while some higher-metallicity and/or younger UFCSs are clearly star clusters, the dynamical and/or chemical evidence allows the possibility that up to $\\sim$50% of the UFCSs in our sample (9 of 19) may represent the smallest and least-massive galaxies yet discovered.",

Virginia McSwain Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) OB stars generally form in open clusters within the Milky Way's thin disk, so when they are found at high Galactic latitudes, it is thought that they were ejected from their birth clusters during the past few tens of millions of years. Using Gaia Data Release 3 (hereafter DR3) data, we traced the kinematic trajectories of 39 high-latitude B-type stars and 447 Galactic open clusters with high-quality astrometry to search for moments of past intersection. In cases where we found matching trajectories, we also considered the clusters' HR diagrams to confirm parent-orphan pairs have matching ages. Further analysis of the clusters' core environments allowed us to determine a probable ejection mechanism. Through these paternity tests, we have identified possible origins for five of these orphaned B-type stars. Here we present the likely travel times, ejection velocities, and a discussion of the runaway mechanism for each case. We also identify one star whose trajectory did not bring it near the disk during the time period of our analysis, and we discuss its possible origins as well.",

They are available at: this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) If modified gravity holds, but the weak lensing analysis is done in the standard way, one finds that dark matter halos have peculiar shapes, not following the standard Navarro-Frenk-White profiles, and are fully predictable from the distribution of baryons. Here we study in detail the distribution of the apparent dark matter around point masses, which approximate galaxies and galaxy clusters, and their pairs for the QUMOND MOND gravity, taking an external gravitational acceleration $g_e$ into account. At large radii, the apparent halo of a point mass $M$ is shifted against the direction of the external field. When averaged over all lines-of-sight, the halo has a hollow center, and denoting the by $a_0$ the MOND acceleration constant, its density behaves like $\\rho(r)=\\sqrt{Ma_0/G}/(4\\pi r^2)$ between the galacticentric radii $\\sqrt{GM/a_0}$ and $\\sqrt{GMa_0}/g_e$, and like $\\rho\\propto r^{-7}G^2M^3a_0^3/g_e^5$ further away. Between a pair of point masses, there is a region of a negative apparent dark matter density, whose mass can exceed the baryonic mass of the system. The density of the combined dark matter halo is not a sum of the densities of the halos of the individual points. The density has a singularity near the zero-acceleration point, but remains finite in projection. We compute maps of the surface density and the lensing shear for several configurations of the problem, and derive formulas to scale them to further configurations. In general, for a large subset of MOND theories in their weak field regime, for any configuration of the baryonic mass $M$ with the characteristic size of $d$, the total lensing density scales as $\\rho({\\vec{x}})=\\sqrt{Ma_0/G}d^{-2}f\\left(\\vec{\\alpha},\\vec{x}/d,g_ed/\\sqrt{GMa_0}\\right)$, where the vector $\\vec{\\alpha}$ describes the geometry of the system.

Accepted for publication in A&A. Video talk on the paper is at: this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy has five massive globular clusters (GCs). They are often used for testing different dark matter and modified gravity theories, because it is difficult to reconcile their old stellar ages with the short time they need to settle in the center of the galaxy due to dynamical friction. Using high resolution $N$-body simulations with the Phantom of Ramses code, we investigate whether the GCs of Fornax can be reconciled with the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), namely its QUMOND formulation. Observational data interpreted in MOND indicate that Fornax is a tidal dwarf galaxy formed at redshift $z=0.9$ in a flyby of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda galaxies, and that its GCs were initially massive star clusters in the disk of the MW. This helps us to set up and interpret the simulations. In the simulations, a point-mass GC orbits Fornax, and they both orbit the MW. When we ran multiple simulations with varying initial conditions for the GC, we found a 20% probability of Fornax being observed with five unsunk GCs. The unsunk GCs have the observed radial distribution. Moreover, we found: 1) In MOND, Fornax has an orbit around the MW such that the pericenters coincide with the observed peaks in the star formation history of Fornax; 2) The simulations reproduce the observed ``diffuse stellar halo'' of Fornax; 3) The simulations predict that Fornax has a stellar stream, which could be detectable in the existing data. 4) An extra simulation shows that if Fornax was initially a rotating disky tidal dwarf galaxy, the gravitational influence of the MW would be able to transform it into a nonrotating spheroidal. 5) Sometimes Phantom of Ramses does not conserve angular momentum. This makes the GC sink too fast if it is simulated as an $N$-body object.",

We dynamically decompose clusters into orbiting and infalling material and fit their density profiles. We find that the truncation radius $r_{\\mathrm{t}}$, associated with the splashback feature, coincides for stars and dark matter, but the stellar profile exhibits a systematically steeper decline. Both components follow a consistent $r_{\\mathrm{t}}{-}\\Gamma$ relation, where $\\Gamma$ is the mass accretion rate, which suggests that stellar profiles can be used to infer recent cluster mass growth. We also find that the normalisation of the density profile of infalling material correlates with $\\Gamma$, and that stellar and dark matter scale radii coincide when measured non-parametrically. By fitting stellar profiles in projection, we show that $r_{\\mathrm{t}}$ can, in principle, be recovered observationally, with a typical scatter of $\\sim 0.3\\,R_{200\\mathrm{m}}$.

Re-submitted after revision to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Nuclear star clusters (NSC) are dense and compact stellar systems, of sizes of few parsecs, located at galactic centers. Their properties and formation mechanisms seem to be tightly linked to the evolution of the host galaxy, with potentially different formation channels for late- and early-type galaxies (respectively, LTGs and ETGs). While most observations target ETGs, here we focus on the NSC in M 74 (NGC 628), a relatively massive, gas-rich and star-forming spiral galaxy, part of the PHANGS survey. We analyzed the central arcmin of the PHANGS-MUSE mosaic, in which the NSC is not spatially resolved. We performed a two-dimensional spectro-photometric decomposition of the MUSE cube, employing a modified version of the C2D code, to disentangle the NSC from the host galaxy. Here we used three components: a bulge, a disk and a NSC approximated to the point spread function (PSF), obtaining three data cubes, one for each component. This allowed us to extract separately the age, metallicity and [Mg/Fe] abundance for the NSC and the host galaxy. Our results show a very old and metal-poor NSC, in contrast to the surrounding regions. While similar properties were found in NSCs hosted by galaxies of different masses and/or morphological types from M 74, they are somewhat unexpected for a relatively massive star-forming spiral galaxy. The spatially resolved stellar populations of the host galaxy display much younger (light-weighted) ages and higher metallicities, especially in the central region (${\\sim}500$ pc) surrounding the NSC. This suggests that this NSC formed a long time ago, and evolved passively until today, without any further growth. Our results show that the NSC was not involved in the active recent star-formation history of its host galaxy.",

This version is after language editor corrections Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Methods: We obtained adaptive optics-assisted integral field spectroscopy in the near-infrared (IR) $K$ band ($1.93-2.47 \\mathrm{\\mu m}$) with VLT/SINFONI, complemented by VLA X and C bands (3$-$6 cm) and ALMA band 3 ($\\sim$3.3 mm) observations. Results: The near-IR continuum reveals two infrared sources, IRS 2 and IRS 7, while the main protostellar core IRAS 18162-2048 remains undetected up to $2.47 \\mathrm{\\mu m}$. IRS 7 shows a peculiar Hydrogen Recombination Line Br$\\gamma$ profile with a narrow emission component superimposed on a broad absorption feature, consistent with a B2/B3 zero-age main-sequence star. Extended H$_2$ emission exhibits a `sawtooth' pattern in the excitation diagram, characteristic of UV radiation in a PDR rather than shock excitation. The radiative transfer model Cloudy reproduces the H$_2$ ro-vibrational populations for $T_\\mathrm{gas}=600$ K and $n_\\mathrm{H}=7.9\\times10^3 \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. VLA X and C bands observations reveal a compact radio source previously reported as a stationary condensation (SC) and coincident with IRS 7. For the first time, we detect IRS 7/SC in mm wavelengths. The spectral index in the 3$-$6 cm and 3.3 mm regime is consistent with optically thin free-free emission. Conclusions: Our near-IR and radio observations reveal that IRS 7/SC is a B2/B3 ZAMS star that has begun to photoionise its environment, giving rise to an extended PDR and a compact \\ion{H}{ii} region. The coexistence of this source with the deeply embedded protostar IRAS 18162-2048 and other bubble-like structures in the field, suggests a multigenerational star-forming environment. Future \\textit{James Webb Space Telescope} observations targeting the H$_2$ pure rotational lines ($3-28 \\mathrm{\\mu m}$) and other HRLs less affected by extinction will be essential to characterise the cooler molecular and ionised gas to fully disclose the formation history of the region.",

Santos, Catherine Cress, Daniel J.B. Smith, Catherine Hale, José Afonso, Imogen H. Whittam, Mattia Vaccari, Ian Heywood, Shuowen Jin, Fangxia An Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Deep radio continuum surveys provide fundamental constraints on galaxy evolution, but source confusion limits sensitivity to the faintest sources. We present a complete framework for producing high-fidelity deblended radio catalogs from the confused MIGHTEE maps using the probabilistic deblending framework XID+ and prior positions from deep multi-wavelength data in the COSMOS field. To assess performance, we construct MIGHTEE-like simulations based on the Tiered Radio Extragalactic Continuum Simulation (T-RECS) radio source population, ensuring a realistic distribution of star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) for validation. Through these simulations, we show that prior catalog purity is the dominant factor controlling deblending accuracy: a high-purity prior, containing only sources with a high likelihood of radio detection, recovers accurate flux densities and reproduces input source counts down to $\\sim 3\\sigma$ (where $\\sigma = $ thermal noise). On the other hand, a complete prior overestimates the source counts due to spurious detections. Our optimal strategy combines the high-purity prior with a mask that removes sources detected above $50~\\mu$Jy. Applied to the $\\sim$1.3\\,deg$^2$ area of the MIGHTEE-COSMOS field defined by overlapping multi-wavelength data, this procedure yields a deblended catalog of 89,562 sources. The derived 1.4\\,GHz source counts agree with independent P(D) analyses and indicate that we resolve the radio background to $\\sim 4.8\\,\\mu$Jy. We also define a recommended high-fidelity sample of 20,757 sources, based on detection significance, flux density, and goodness-of-fit, which provides reliable flux densities for individual sources in the confusion-limited regime.",

      "abstract": "ClearPotential: Revealing Local Dark Matter in Three Dimensions Eric Putney, David Shih, Sung Hak Lim, Matthew R. Buckley Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We present ClearPotential, a data-driven, three-dimensional measurement of the gravitational potential of the local Milky Way using unsupervised machine learning, without the symmetry assumptions, specific functional forms, and binning required in previous work. The potential is modeled as a neural network, optimized to solve the equilibrium collisionless Boltzmann equation for the observed phase space density of Gaia DR3 Red Clump stars within 4 kpc of the Sun. This density is obtained from data using normalizing flows, and our unsupervised solution to the Boltzmann equation automatically corrects for selection effects from crowding and the dust-driven extinction of starlight. Our fully-differentiable model of the gravitational potential allows us to map the acceleration and mass density of the Galaxy in the volume around the Sun, including in the dust-obscured disk towards the Galactic Center. We determine the dark matter density at the Solar radius to be $(0.84 \\pm 0.08)\\times 10^{-2}\\,{M}_\\odot/{\\rm pc}^3$, and analyze the structure of the dark matter halo. We find strong evidence for a tilted oblate halo, weak preference for a cored inner profile, and the strongest constraints to date on a possible dark matter disk. We place a bound on the timescale of disequilibrium in the local Milky Way, and find mild evidence for disequilibrium using independent acceleration measurements from timings of binary pulsar systems. This work provides the clearest map of the local Galactic potential to date and marks an important step in the era of data-driven astrometry.",

Dartois, A. Fuente, J.R. Goicoechea, E. Habart, M. J. McCaughrean, T. Onaka, E. Peeters Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We use the high angular resolution NIRCam images from the \\textit{PDRs4All} program, combined with those of GTO program 1256, to extract key properties of disks in the Orion Nebula Cluster. We measure disk radii in silhouette against the bright background, identify dissociation fronts (DFs) and ionization fronts (IFs), determine Paschen $\\alpha$ intensities, and derive near-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs). From these diagnostics we define a typology of ONC disks. \\textit{Type I} sources show merged IFs and DFs close to the disk surface. \\textit{Type II} sources have DFs at the disk surface and IFs located tens of astronomical units away. \\textit{Type III} sources show a DF at the disk surface but no IF. For all types, PAH emission traces the PDR. We find that the disk radius $r{\\rm disk}$ increases with projected distance to the ionizing source $d{\\rm proj}$, following $r{\\rm disk} \\propto d{\\rm proj}^{0.30}$, consistent with disk truncation by photoevaporation. Disk radii measured in the infrared are larger than those measured at millimeter wavelengths, suggesting radial dust segregation within the disks. In agreement with PDR models, the thermal pressure in the disk PDR increases with the FUV radiation field $G_0$, but with a flatter slope. Finally, the SEDs of candidate Jupiter Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) are similar to those of \\textit{Type III} disks, except for JuMBO24, which resembles a \\textit{Type I} or \\textit{Type II} source. Its SED is consistent with a young low-mass binary hosting an unresolved ionized disk.",

Integrating spatially resolved solar observations into disk-integrated datasets, these studies provide insights into magnetic activity occurring in distant stars. This review highlights key results from recent analyses that employed all three SDO instruments to characterize active regions, quantify universal heating relationships, and reconstruct stellar X-ray and ultraviolet spectra.

This underscores the importance of a thorough exploration of each outbursting object. We studied a peculiar outbursting system, Gaia24ccy, which exhibited two $\\Delta g \\sim$ 3.8 mag outbursts in 2019 and 2024. The system consists of two unresolved, nearly identical, and rapidly rotating young stars: Gaia24ccy A (1.1419 days) and Gaia24ccy B (1.7898 days). Periodogram analyses just before the onset of the outbursts suggest Gaia24ccy B to be the outbursting component. Unlike any previously known EXor sources, the two outburst profiles show a very similar evolution: both rose at the same rate for the first 15 days, followed by many 'sub-bursts' on the timescale of 10-20 days. The 2019 outburst lasted 145-255 days, while the 2024 outburst persisted for 367 days. We infer the unstable region to lie at $r_{\\rm trigger} \\simeq 0.019-0.047$ au ($\\sim5-12.3 R_\\star$). The accreted mass per event $M_{\\rm acc}\\sim10^{-5} M_\\odot$ can be provided by a compact inner-disk reservoir. The photometric rise/decay timescales and the mid-infrared color evolution favor a thermal-viscous trigger in a hot inner disk, while the appearance of rich emission-line spectra indicates concurrent magnetospheric compression - together best described by a hybrid picture. Finally, we explain the reddening of the mid-infrared color observed during the outburst as a consequence of the competing emission from the viscous disk and the photosphere.",

Gallagher Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) This study characterises a series of type~II radio bursts associated with a CME that occurred on 14 May, focusing on the coronal conditions during the event and identifying the likely location of the shocks where the radio bursts are generated. The CME was tracked using a combination of white light and extreme ultraviolet observations of the solar corona taken by three instruments: GOES-SUVI, two coronagraphs of the SOHO-LASCO, together with ground-based radio observations between 10-240~MHz from I-LOFAR. The radial distances of the radio sources were examined using a series of density models, with both PFSS and MHD models used to examine the coronal plasma conditions. Four type~II bursts were identified in the I$-$LOFAR radio dynamic spectrum over $\\sim$15~minutes, exhibiting features such as band splitting, herringbones, and fragmentation. The shocks were found to have speeds ranging between $\\sim$443$-$2075~km s$^{-1}$, with drift rates of $\\sim-$361 to -78~kHz~s$^{-1}$. The shocks were found to have a $M_A \\approx$ 3.21$-$3.57. indicating that they were super-Alfvénic. The first type~II burst was triggered $\\sim$18~minutes after the CME launch, with each burst appearing to have been generated at a different height in the corona. Analysis of the derived kinematics and modelling results suggests that the type~II bursts were likely produced at the shoulders of the CME near the flanks, where open magnetic field lines and relatively low Alfvén speeds facilitated shock formation. This multi-instrument study shows that multiple type II bursts from a single CME originated at different coronal heights, with modelling indicating their generation near the CME flanks, where low Alfvén speeds and open magnetic field lines facilitated shock formation.",

Gonzalez, C. Gonzalez, A. Tenerani Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) Characterizing compressible fluctuations in the solar wind is essential for understanding their role in solar wind acceleration and heating, yet their origin and evolution across different turbulence regimes remain poorly understood. In this study, we carry out a statistical analysis of the properties of compressible fluctuations in solar wind dominated by balanced and imbalanced turbulence. Using in-situ measurements from Wind, Solar Orbiter, and Parker Solar Probe, we investigate the scale dependence of density and magnetic field fluctuations and their correlations with plasma beta and radial distance. Our results indicate that solar wind compressibility is likely affected by both expansion effects and compressible dynamics governed by local plasma conditions. The non-Alfvenic wind is dominated by anti-correlated fluctuations, whereas the Alfvenic wind contains a mixture of correlated and anti-correlated fluctuations, though the latter remain prevalent. While the anti-correlated component is consistent with MHD slow magnetosonic modes, the correlated (fast mode-like) component is not reproduced by predictions from either linear MHD theory or nonlinear models of forced compressible fluctuations. Nevertheless, the dominant slow mode component explains the observed dependence on beta and the enhanced density fluctuations measured by Parker Solar Probe. This further suggests that slow mode waves contribute significantly to the compressible energy budget near the Sun and may play an important role in solar wind heating and acceleration close to the Sun.",

Located only 36.4 pc distant, HD 61005 is young (approx. 100 Myr), x-ray bright (300 times Solar), observed with nearly edge-on geometry, and surrounded by Local Interstellar Medium (LISM) material denser than in the environ of the Sun. HD 61005 is known to harbor large amounts of circumstellar dust in a dense ecliptic plane full of mm-sized particles plus attached, extended wing like structures full of micron sized particles, which are evidence for a strong LISM-dust disk interaction. These properties aided our ability to resolve the 220 au wide astrosphere of HD61005, the first ever observed for a main sequence G-star. The observed x-ray emission morphology is roughly spherical, as expected for an astrospheric structure dominated by the host star. The Chandra spectrum of HD 61005 is a combination of a hard stellar coronal emission (T=8 MK) at Lx = 6 x10e29 erg per sec, plus an extended halo contribution at Lx = 1x10e29 erg per sec dominated by charge exchange (CXE) lines, such as those of OVIII and NeIX. The Chandra CXE x-ray morphology does not track the planar dust morphology but does extend out roughly to where the base of the dust wings begins. We present a toy model of x-ray emission produced by stellar wind (SW)-LISM CXE interactions, similar to the state of the young Sun when it was approximately 100 Myrs old (Guinan and Engle 2007), and transiting through an approximately 1000 times denser part of the interstellar medium (ISM) such as a Giant Molecular Cloud (Stern 2003, Opher and Loeb 2024).",

Sunspot boundaries are commonly outlined by contours of the continuum intensity. However, their magnetic nature has not yet been fully characterised. Aims. We investigate the properties of the outer boundary of a long-lived sunspot to identify the magnetic property that defines it. Methods. We analysed the magnetic properties of AR NOAA11591 spot during its two passages across the solar disc, using SDO/HMI continuum intensity and magnetic field, and determined their contours to outline the outer boundary. Results. During the 1st disc passage, in which the sunspot is in its stable phase, the intensity contours at 0.9 of the mean quiet Sun intensity and isocontours of the magnetic field strength of 625G provide an almost perfect match between the two contours. With these thresholds, the time-averaged area of mismatch is minimised, yielding an average distance between the contours of 0.58 pixel, corresponding to less than 0.26 arcsec. During the 2nd disc passage, the spot shows clear signs of decay, and we find that the 0.9 intensity and 625G magnetic isocontours detach from each other, coupled to the disappearance of penumbra. In this super-equipartition area, granulation still operates. Conclusions. Based on a comparison with simulation data from our previous work, and in agreement with findings of other authors, we conclude that the outer boundary of stable sunspots is defined by an invariant magnetic field: the equipartition field. From the discrepancy between intensity and magnetic contours during the decaying phase of the sunspot, we surmise that alongside the well-established (magneto-)convective regimes of the photosphere - granular, penumbral, and umbral - a super-equipartition granular regime can be identified. In this regime, bright, but smaller granules occur where the magnetic field exceeds equipartition but remains sub-critical for convection suppression.",

Alterman Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Ion-driven plasma instability thresholds, derived from linear theory, constrain the distribution of solar observations in parameter space, defining boundaries of stable plasma parameters. Excursions beyond these thresholds result in the emission of energy, transferred from particles to coherent electromagnetic waves, acting to adjust the system toward a more stable configuration. In this work, we use linear Vlasov--Maxwell theory to define parametric limits for a low-$\\beta$ plasma that contains a drifting proton beam or helium ($\\alpha$-particle) population. A sufficiently fast and dense drifting population triggers an Oblique Drift Instability (ODI). This instability decreases the velocity drift between the thermal core proton and secondary populations and prevents the ratio of core thermal to magnetic pressure $\\beta_c$ from decreasing below a minimum value by increasing the temperatures - i.e. heating - of both the core and drifting populations. Our theoretical results are of interest for Parker Solar Probe observations, as they provide an additional mechanism for perpendicular heating of ions active in the sub-\\Alfvenic solar wind. The ODI may explain the discrepancy between long-standing expectations of measurements of very low-$\\beta$ plasmas with very large ion temperature anisotropies in the near-Sun environment and in situ observations, where $\\beta$ is consistently measured above a few percent and the secondary ion populations drift faster than the bulk of proton population by no more than approximately the local Alfven speed.",

In this study, we use Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations from Encounters 1 through 24 to investigate the radial evolution of solar wind plasma and magnetic field properties in this region. Using intervals with high field-of-view ($>85\\%$) coverage, we derive the radial profiles of magnetic field strength ($|B|$), proton density ($N$), bulk speed ($V$), total proton temperature ($T$), parallel ($T_\\parallel$) and perpendicular ($T_\\perp$) temperatures, temperature anisotropy ($T_\\perp/T_\\parallel$), plasma beta ($\\beta$), Alfvén Mach number ($M_A$), and magnetic field fluctuations ($\\delta B/B$) for sub and super-Alfvénic regions. In super-Alfvénic regions, power-law of $|B|$, $N$, $V$, and $T$ as a function of heliocentric distance are broadly consistent with previous \\textit{Helios} results at $>0.3$ AU. The radial evolution of the components of the temperature tensor reveals distinct behavior: $T_\\perp$ decreases monotonically with distance, whereas $T_\\parallel$ exhibits a non-monotonic trend -- decreasing in the sub-Alfvénic region, increasing just beyond the Alfvén surface. We interpret the increase in $T_\\parallel$ as a proxy for proton beam occurrence. We further examine the evolution of magnetic field fluctuations, finding decreasing radial/parallel fluctuations but enhanced tangential/normal/perpendicular fluctuations in sunward direction. These fluctuations may provide free energy for beam generation and particle heating via wave-particle interactions.",

Because the Pt/Cr-Ne lamps used for the wavecals have been fading (especially at the shortest wavelengths), some changes in the default lamp and/or exposure time have been implemented in recent years to maintain accurate calibrations. To assess whether additional changes might be appropriate, we examine the distribution of the SHIFTA1, SHIFTA2 values derived from the wavecals (the x and y offsets of the spectral image on the detector), we re-visit the wavelength-dependent fading of the lamps, and we perform simulations to estimate the exposure times that would be needed to obtain accurate SHIFTA values. While the current wavecals do appear to yield reasonable SHIFTA, increases in the default exposure times for some of the shortest-wavelength settings would help to ensure reliable wavelength zero points as the lamps continue to fade.",

The success of such searches depends on a reliable background prediction via Monte Carlo simulations. A widely used toolkit to construct these simulations is Geant4, which offers the user a wide choice of how to implement the physics of particle interactions. For example, for electromagnetic interactions, Geant4 provides pre-defined sets of implementations: physics constructors. As decay products of radioactive contaminants contribute to the background mainly via electromagnetic interactions, the physics constructor used in a Geant4 simulation may have an impact on the total energy deposition inside the detector target. To facilitate the selection of physics constructors for simulations of experiments that are using CaWO$_4$ and Ge targets, we quantify their impact on the total energy deposition for several test cases. These cases consist of radioactive contaminants commonly encountered, covering energy depositions via $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$ particles, as well as two examples for the target thickness: thin and bulky. We also consider the computing performance of the studied physics constructors.",

Miller 2026 PASP 138 024503 Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We present a novel host galaxy subtraction technique in long-slit spectroscopy for extragalactic transients. Unlike classic methods which generally estimate the background using a simple linear interpolation of local galaxy flux in the 2D spectrum, our approach leverages multi-band archival images of the host galaxies to model the background emission from the galaxy in the 2D spectrum. Such imaging encodes the wavelength-dependent galaxy profile along the slit, and is readily accessible through wide-field imaging surveys. We construct a smooth prior for the 2D galaxy profile with a Gaussian process (GP) based on these reference images, and use another GP to model the correlated deviations from the prior in the observed spectrum. This enables accurate inference of the galaxy flux blended with the transient. On synthetic long-slit data of a spiral galaxy extracted from a Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer hyper-spectral cube, the GP method remains robust as long as the host galaxy is spatially resolved and consistently outperforms classic methods. We apply the method to archival Keck spectra of two real transients, SN 2019eix and AT 2019qiz, to further demonstrate how the method uniquely recovers weak spectral features amid strong galaxy contamination, enabling refined constraints on the properties of both transients.

Cory Padgett, Jeffrey Fung Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Protoplanetary disks can become eccentric when planets open deep gaps within, but how eccentric are they? We answer this question by analyzing two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of planet-disk interaction. The steady state eccentricity of the outer disk (outside of the planet's orbit) is described as a balance between eccentricity excitation by the 1:3 eccentric Lindblad resonance and eccentricity damping by gas pressure. This eccentricity scales with $q(\\frac{h_p}{r_p})^{(-1)}(\\frac{r_{gap}}{r_p})^{(a-\\frac{b}{2}-2)}$, where $q$ is the planet-to-star mass ratio, $\\frac{h_p}{r_p}$ is the disk aspect ratio, $\\frac{r_{gap}}{r_p}$ is the radial position of the outer gap edge divided by the planet's position, and $a$ and $b$ are the negative exponents in the disk's surface density and temperature power law profiles, respectively. We derive a semi-analytic eccentricity profile that agrees with numerical simulations to within 30%.

      "abstract": "Using EUV driven external photoevaporation to test viscous evolution of protoplanetary discs Giulia Ballabio, James E. Owen Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Protoplanetary discs are thought to evolve either through angular momentum transport driven by viscous processes or through angular momentum removal induced by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) winds. One proposed method to distinguish between these two evolutionary pathways is by comparing mass accretion rates and disc sizes, but observational constraints complicate this distinction. In this study, we investigate how extreme ultraviolet (EUV) external photoevaporation affects the evolution of protoplanetary discs, particularly in environments such as the Orion Nebula Cluster. Using a combination of analytical derivations and 1D numerical simulations, we explore the impact of externally induced mass-loss on disc structure and accretion dynamics. We demonstrate that, in the viscous scenario, there exists a clear, near one-to-one correlation between the mass-loss rate due to external photoevaporative outflows and the mass accretion rate onto the central star. In contrast, MHD wind-driven discs do not exhibit such trend, leading to a distinct evolutionary path. External photoevaporative mass-loss rates and mass accretion rates can both be accurately measured for a population of discs, without a strong model dependence. Thus, our findings provide a robust observational test to distinguish between viscous and MHD wind-driven disc evolution, offering a new approach to constraining angular momentum transport mechanisms in protoplanetary discs. Applying this diagnostic observationally requires joint measurements of $\\dot{M}_{\\rm acc}$ and $\\dot{M}_{\\rm pe}$ for the same objects, which are currently scarce in bright HII regions due to contamination and sensitivity limitations.",

We show that the presence of a circumstellar torus significantly increases the equivalent width of the observed stellar He I 10830~Å~line. When combined with observations of the star's Ca II H & K lines, these systems can typically be distinguished from field stars.

The analysis of 67 simulated systems revealed key insights: (1) All systems featured the primary trans-Neptunian object (TNO) populations: cold/hot classical, resonant, scattered, and detached; (2) Captures into stable resonant orbits favored close Neptunian mean motion resonances (MMRs; e.g., 3:2, 2:1), while distant ones beyond 50 au (e.g., 5:2 MMR) were underpopulated; (3) Optimal matches to observed resonant fractions and the classical region (including the kernel) arose from models considering a jumping Neptune, self-gravitating Plutos, and an initial disk edge at 45-47 au; (4) Models including primordial scattered disks boosted distant MMR captures but overproduced scattered objects; (5) All models were inefficient at producing the detached (q > 40 au) and high-i (i > 45 deg) populations and failed to populate observed niches, such as distant detached (a > 245 au), low-i detached (i < 20 deg), low-i scattered with q = 37-40 au (i < 20 deg), and extreme (q > 50 au or i > 50 deg) TNOs; (6) Grainy migration effects peaked early, fading as the Plutos were removed; (7) With a few primordial Plutos surviving inside 50 au, the initial population was estimated at ~150-500 to explain Pluto's solitary status. Although our four-giant-planet models reasonably replicate the trans-Neptunian structure within 50 au, they fail to account for detached, high-i, and extreme TNOs. Additional processes (e.g., a distant undiscovered planet) are required for a comprehensive outer solar system framework.",

      "abstract": "A Collective Trigger for Widespread Planetesimal Formation Revealed by Accretion Ages James Bryson, Hannah Sanderson, Francis Nimmo, Sanjana Sridhar, Gregory Brennecka, Yves Marrocchi, Jason Terry Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The formation of planetesimals was an integral part of the cascading series of processes that built the terrestrial planets. To illuminate planetesimal formation, here we develop a refined thermal evolution model to calculate the formation ages of meteorite parent planetesimals. This model includes chemical reactions and phase changes during heating, as well as natural variations in the proportions of the constituent phases of these planetesimals. We find that the parent bodies of non-carbonaceous (NC) and carbonaceous (CC) iron meteorites start forming at very similar times (~0.95 Myr after calcium-aluminium-rich inclusion [CAI] formation) and occupy overlapping time windows. NC and CC chondrite parent bodies formed later during non-overlapping periods. We combine these ages with proportions of isotopic end-members we recover from mixing models to construct records of motion throughout the protoplanetary disk. These records argue that NC and CC material traversed the barrier in the disk after ~0.95 Myr after CAI formation. The onset of this motion coincided with planetesimal formation, indicating that the phenomenon that drove motion also triggered planetesimal formation. We argue that this feature also served as the semi-permeable barrier in the disk. Although its identity is uncertain, the effects this phenomenon had on the timing of planetesimal formation and motion through the disk can now serve as constraints on models of disk evolution. Models that reproduce these effects would elucidate the nature and implications of this phenomenon, which is key to unlocking a holistic model of terrestrial planet building.",

      "abstract": "Analytical modeling of helium absorption signals of isothermal atmospheric escape Hiroto Mitani, Rolf Kuiper 12 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Atmospheric escape driven by extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation is a critical process shaping the evolution of close-in exoplanets. Recent observations have detected helium triplet absorption in numerous (>20) close-in exoplanets, highlighting the importance of understanding upper atmospheric thermo-chemical structure. While super-solar metallicity has been observed in the atmospheres of some close-in exoplanets, the impact of metal species on both atmospheric escape dynamics and observed absorption features remains poorly understood. In this study, we derive a simplified yet accurate formula for the equivalent width of helium absorption in the limit of an isothermal temperature for the upper atmosphere. Our results demonstrate that planets with lower temperature (metal-rich atmosphere) exhibit lower mass-loss rate although the equivalent width of helium triplet absorption remains largely independent of atmospheric temperature (metallicity) because the low temperatures in these atmospheres enhance the fraction of helium in its triplet state. Additionally, we present a hydrodynamic model based on radiation-hydrodynamics simulations that incorporates the effects of metal cooling. Our analytical model can predict the helium triplet equivalent width of the atmosphere of simulations. The analytical model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how metal cooling in the upper atmosphere influences the thermo-chemical structure and observable helium features of close-in exoplanetary atmospheres, offering valuable insights for interpreting current and future observational data.",

Mousis Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 545, Issue 3, January 2026 Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Complex organic molecules are key markers of molecular diversity, and their formation conditions in protoplanetary disks remain an active area of research. These molecules have been detected on a variety of celestial bodies, including icy moons, and may play a crucial role in shaping the current composition of the Galilean moons. Experimental studies suggest that their formation could result from UV irradiation or thermal processing of NH3:CO2 ices. In this context, we investigate the formation of complex organic molecules in the protosolar nebula and their subsequent transport to the Jupiter system region. Lagrangian transport and irradiation simulations of 500 individual particles are performed using a two-dimensional disk evolution model. Based on experiments with UV irradiation and thermal processing of CO2:NH3 ice, this model allows us to estimate the estimate the potential for the formation of complex organic molecules through these processes. Almost none of the particles released at a local temperature of 20 K (corresponding to ~12 AU from the Sun) reach the location of the system of Jupiter. However, when released at a local temperature of 80 K (~7 AU), approximately 45% of the centimetric particles and 30% of the micrometric particles can form complex organic molecules via thermal processing, subsequently reaching the location of the system of Jupiter within 300 kyr. Assuming that the Galilean moons formed in a cold circumplanetary disk around Jupiter, the nitrogen-bearing species potentially present in their interiors could have originated from the formation of complex organic molecules in the protosolar nebula.",

Vance 233 pages, 37 figures, 12 tables Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Saturn's moon Titan exhibits remarkable parallels to the Earth in many geophysical and geological processes not found elsewhere in the solar system at the present day. These include a nitrogen atmosphere with a condensible gas - methane - replacing the Earth's water, leading to an active meteorology with rainfall and surface manifestations including rivers, lakes and seas, and the dissolution of karstic terrain. Other phenomena such as craters, dunes, and tectonic features are found elsewhere - e.g. on Mars and Venus - but their continuing alteration by pluvial, fluvial and lacustrine processes can be studied only on Earth and Titan. Meanwhile Titan also hosts an interior liquid water ocean with similarities to the Earth as well as to ocean worlds such as Europa and Enceladus. Our focus in this review paper is twofold: to describe the geophysical and geological parallels between Earth and Titan, and to evaluate the yet-underexploited possibilities for field analog research to gain new knowledge about these processes. To date, Titan's much colder temperature and different atmospheric and crustal materials have led to a skepticism that useful analogs can be found on Earth. Our conclusion, however, is that a much larger range of useful analog field work is possible and this work will substantially enhance our knowledge of both worlds. Such investigation will supplement the existing sparse data for Titan returned by space missions, will greatly enhance our understanding of such datasets, and will help to provide science impetus and goals for future missions.",

Zdenek Sekanina Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) This paper describes progress achieved in early investigations of the orbital motion and light curve of comet C/2026 A1 (MAPS), the third ground-based discovery of a Kreutz sungrazer in the 21st century. The highly unusual trait of the comet that has so far been ascertained is its extraordinarily long orbital period. The most recent orbital computations make it increasingly likely that the object is a fragment of one of the comets observed by Ammianus Marcellinus in AD 363, thereby strengthening evidence in support of the contact-binary hypothesis of the Kreutz system. In this context, the comet is the only second-generation fragment of Aristotle's comet that we are aware of to appear after the 12th century. It does not look like a major fragment, but rather like an outlying fragment of a much larger sungrazer. In 363 it apparently separated from a parent different from the lineage of comet Pereyra. The light curve of comet MAPS has so far been fairly smooth, without outbursts. To reach the brightness of comet Ikeya-Seki, the comet would have to follow an r^(-17) law in the coming weeks, which is unlikely.",

Farrell, Nikolai Simonov, Alvaro Romero-Calvo, Thomas M. Orlando, Phillip N. First, Zhigang Jiang Applied Physics (physics.app-ph); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) We present g4chargeit, a kinetic Monte Carlo framework built on Geant4 for self-consistent simulation of time-dependent electrostatic charging in dielectric materials. The model explicitly incorporates stochastic particle transport and scattering processes using validated Geant4 cross-sections, while self-consistently evolving the electric potential and field. As a representative application, we simulate the charging of regolith grains under average dayside conditions on the Moon. The surface of the Moon, in addition to other airless planetary bodies, are regularly exposed to solar ultraviolet photons and solar-wind plasma, creating a radiation environment in which electrostatic interactions among regolith grains become significant. Until now, simulations of regolith charging have often relied on analytical approximations that oversimplify grain geometry and interaction mechanisms. Our Geant4-based simulations reveal charge accumulation within intergrain micro-cavities, leading to repulsive electrostatic forces consistent with experimental observations. The framework establishes a multiscale approach that links microscopic scattering events to the continuity equation of surface charge density and to the formation of macroscopic surface charge patches in complex grain geometries. Although demonstrated here for planetary regolith, the method is general and applicable to a broad range of dielectric charging problems. The code is openly available at this https URL.",

Here, we expanded our previous work by conducting a comprehensive analysis of 37 optimal terrestrial planet systems obtained in the context of the JSCE scenario. Each optimal system harbored exactly four terrestrial planets analogs to Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. We further investigated water delivery, feeding zones, and accretion history for the planet analogs, which allowed us to better constrain the water distribution in the disk. The main findings of this work are as follows: 1) the formation of four terrestrial planets with orbits and masses similar to those observed in our solar system in most of our sample, as evidenced by the dynamically colder and hotter orbits of Venus-Earth and Mercury-Mars analogs, and the high success rates of similar mutual orbital separations (~40-85%) and mass ratios of the planets (~70-90%) among the 37 systems; and 2) water was delivered to all terrestrial planets during their formation through the accretion of water-bearing disk objects from beyond ~1-1.5 au. The achievement of Earth's estimated bulk water content required the disk to contain sufficient water mass distributed within those objects initially. This requirement implies that Mercury, Venus, and Mars acquired water similar to the amount on Earth during their formation. Several of our planet analogs also matched additional constraints, such as the timing of Moon formation by a giant impact, Earth's late accretion mass and composition, and Mars's formation timescale.",

Makarov, Amir Khan Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) It is usually taken for granted that mutual synchronisation of a tidal two body system is attained through tidal recession, assuming the reduced Hill sphere is not reached. However, synchronisation can be achieved also via tidal approach, provided the Roche limit is not crossed. For each of the two scenarios, we derive the condition under which the evolving synchronicity radius catches up with the tidally evolving orbit. We consider the two scenarios for the Pluto Charon system and examine the impact origin hypothesis of Charons formation against capture. Based on geophysical evidence, we propose that capture appears more likely. Motivated by this conclusion, we investigate the capture scenario, wherein the orbital evolution of Charon starts at a higher altitude than present and undergoes tidal descent, both analytically and numerically. We also consider the possibility that Plutos initial prograde spin underwent a reversal by a tidally approaching retrograde Charon. Depending on the initial conditions, we observe temporary locking of Charon into higher spin orbit resonances 3:2 to 7:2 during the first 0.5 Myr of the systems evolution. Owing to a greater initial separation between the partners, the power dissipated in each of them turns out to be much lower than in the case of tidal recession of bodies of the same internal structure. The greater initial separation also results in lower tidal stress, which may explain the absence of tidally generated fracture patterns.",
