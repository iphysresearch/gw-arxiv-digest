Avendaño Franco, Rafael Fragozo Larrazabal General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th) A general relativistic model of an astrophysical hypermassive extremely magnetized ultra-compact self-bound quark--gluon plasma object that is supported against its ultimate gravitational implosion by the simultaneous action of the vacuum polarization driven by nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED: light-by-light scattering) and the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) asymptotic freedom, is presented. These QCD stars can be the final figures of the equilibrium of collapsing stellar cores. Post-supernova fallback material pushes the nascent remnant beyond its stability to collapse into a hybrid hypermassive neutron star (HHMNS). Hypercritical accretion can unbind the whole HHMNS's baryons to spontaneously break away color confinement, powering a first-order hadron-to-quark phase transition to a sea of ever-freer quarks and gluons. This core is hydro-stabilized by the steady, endlessly compression-admitting asymptotic freedom state, possibly via gluon-mediated enduring exchange of color charge among bound states. The nonlinear TOV equation indicates the occurrence of hypermassive QGP/QCD stars with a wide mass spectrum ($0\\lesssim$ M$^{\\rm{QGP}}_{\\rm{Star}}\\lesssim$\\,7\\,M$_\\odot$ and beyond), for star radii ($0\\lesssim R^{\\rm{QGP}}_{\\rm{Star}}\\lesssim 24$\\,km and beyond) with B-fields ($10^{14} \\leq$ B$^{\\rm{QGP}}_{\\rm{Star}} \\leq 10^{16}$\\,G and beyond). Such QCD stars can emulate what the true black holes are supposed to gravitationally do in most astrophysical settings. This color quark star could be found through a search for its eternal ``yo-yo'' state gravitational-wave emission, or via lensing phenomena like gravitational rainbows, as in this scenario it is expected that the light deflection angle, directly influenced by the larger effective mass/radius and magnetic field of the deflecting object, increases as the incidence angle decreases for impact parameter lower values.",

Although the AdS/CFT correspondence indicates that information is preserved during black hole evaporation, the precise mechanism by which it is recovered from the Hawking radiation remains an open question. To explore a potential resolution, we investigate information transfer in an analog black hole spacetime realized through position-dependent coupling in an XY spin chain. We derive and demonstrate Page curve-like behavior, and analyze the transmission of quantum resources, such as entanglement and coherence, across the effective horizon. Our results show that quantum resources initially localized within an interior subsystem can be transferred to the exterior via particle radiation through the horizon. This study provides a novel perspective from quantum simulation on how information may escape from black holes, thereby contributing to the further understanding of the black hole information paradox.",

From the covariant fluid effective action, we linearize about equilibrium and obtain the action for fluid displacements coupled to metric perturbations. Splitting the latter into external and induced parts and integrating out the induced field yields a Hermitian operator and a discrete gapped spectrum of driven modes. Projecting the displacement onto this eigenbasis and integrating out the spatial dependence over the stellar radius reduces the dynamics to tidal-driven oscillators, with couplings set by relativistic inner products and overlap integrals. Matching to the quadrupolar worldline effective action gives a mode-sum response function and analytic dynamical tidal deformabilities from mode frequencies, normalizations, and overlaps.",

Carneiro General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The article deals with the gravitational energy associated with axial perturbations of regular black holes. We review the stability of the geometry under odd-parity perturbations and the corresponding quasinormal modes, previously obtained for this class of spacetimes. The perturbative functions describing the metric fluctuations are reconstructed from the master equation. To evaluate the energy content of these perturbations, we employ the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR), which provides a well-defined expression for gravitational energy. The gravitational energy is computed up to second order in the perturbation parameter and expressed in terms of the quasinormal mode functions. Our results establish a direct connection between the dynamical response of regular black holes and the energy carried by their gravitational perturbations.",

Sadurní General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph) Rindler's metric is an interesting way to incorporate a set of uniformly accelerated observers into space-time coordinates; this is consistent with special and general relativity. It is known that such an acceleration gives rise to the famous Unruh effect. Interestingly, its Galilean limit already shows the appearance of quantized modes for particles in free space, given by Airy functions. This happens when a wall or boundary condition is moving in an accelerated trajectory in free space and in the presence of a field. Here we show that such a boundary, when viewed as a material obstacle in motion, gives rise to quantized modes for the Klein-Gordon and Maxwell fields, as long as the boundary does not touch the singularity at the Rindler wedge. This corresponds to a quantum-mechanical problem with an anomalous fall-to-the-origin potential $-1/x^2$ supplemented with a Dirichlet condition. We provide further mathematical analysis regarding the completeness of the solutions in terms of Hankel functions $H^{(1)}$ of imaginary index and argument, and clarify the nature of the corresponding Sobolev spaces when the boundary condition disappears for the accelerated observer. A detailed interpretation of the transition amplitudes is given in connection with particle production obtained from a Bogoliubov transformation.",

At linear order, we obtain the quadratic action for tensor perturbations and show that parity-violating terms associated with $\\mathcal{L}_{1,2,5,6,7}$ render the tensor propagation polarization dependent, leading to chiral primordial spectra and a nonvanishing degree of circular polarization. At second order, we derive the EOM for SIGWs and identify the explicit parity-violating source terms. In particular, $\\mathcal{L}_3$ and $\\mathcal{L}_4$ enter exclusively through the source term for SIGWs, allowing parity violation to arise even when the linear GWs propagation remains effectively GR-like. During the radiation-dominated era, we compute the fractional energy density of SIGWs for both monochromatic and lognormal curvature power spectra. We find that, around the peak frequency, SIGWs in PVST gravity exhibit characteristic deviations from those in GR, resulting in a nonzero degree of circular polarization.",

Our results show that after one year of accumulated observation, these corrections induce a detectable dephasing in the EMRI waveform.

In contrast to quantum mechanical models, the interaction between the system (Maxwell field) and the environment (gravitational field) is not postulated phenomenologically, but is instead dictated by the underlying action in a post-Minkowskian approximation. This framework extends earlier models for a scalar field and enables a more detailed analysis of the role of dynamical reference fields (clocks) within the relational formalism. We show that, for a suitable choice of geometrical clocks together with a U(1)-Gauss clock, and by employing an appropriate combination of the observable map and its dual, the resulting Dirac observables are given directly by the transverse components of the photon field as well as the symmetric-transverse-traceless degrees of freedom of gravitational waves on the linearised phase space of the coupled system. In addition we also compare different choices of Dirac observables and their dynamics. Upon applying a Fock quantisation to the reduced system, we derive the time convolutionless (TCL) master equation, truncated at second order, and analyse its structural properties. These results provide a foundation for further investigations of the decoherence model, including its renormalisation and a detailed study of its one-particle sector, and are found to be structurally consistent with former master equations for photons derived using ADM variables and a specific gauge fixing.",

      "abstract": "Existence of Halos Outside Schwarzschild-$f(R)$ Black Holes Wen-Xiang Chen General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate the possibility of photon halos (stable photon orbits) forming outside Schwarzschild-$f(R)$ black holes by analyzing null geodesics in these spacetimes. Using methods inspired by studies of spherical photon orbits around Kerr-Newman black holes, we derive conditions for the existence of such halos. We examine several f(R) gravity models, including quadratic, logarithmic, exponential, cubic, power-law, and hyperbolic forms, and find that multiple photon orbits -- both stable and unstable -- can appear outside the event horizon for certain parameter ranges. These additional orbits (halos) provide new insights into spacetime geometry and potential observational signatures of black holes in modified gravity. We present analytical expressions for the orbital radii, perform a numerical stability analysis, and discuss possible observational implications for black hole shadows. Our results indicate that while the standard Schwarzschild black hole admits only a single unstable light ring, Schwarzschild-$f(R)$ black holes can support an additional outer stable photon orbit (a halo) without triggering a black-hole bomb instability. This work deepens the understanding of photon-orbit structures in alternative theories of gravity and highlights how such effects could be detected through deviations in black hole shadow size or morphology.",

We demonstrate that physically accurate black hole images, synthesized from magnetized accretion flows, inherently reside on a low-dimensional manifold-encoding the essential features of spacetime geometry, plasma distribution, and relativistic emission. Leveraging this structure, we introduce a physics-conditioned diffusion model that operates in a compact latent space to generate high-fidelity black hole imagery directly from physical parameters. The model accurately reproduces critical observational signatures from full GRRT simulations-such as shadow diameter, photon-ring structure, and relativistic brightness asymmetry-while achieving over a fourfold reduction in computational expense. Compared with the previous generation of denoising diffusion models, the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in image quality, reconstruction fidelity, and parameter estimation accuracy, while reducing the average inference time per black hole image from 5.25 seconds to 1.15 seconds. Our work establishes diffusion-based latent models as efficient and scalable substitutes for traditional radiative transfer solvers, offering a practical framework toward real-time modeling and inference for next-generation black hole imaging.",

Consequently, the impact parameters $\\eta=L/E$ and $\\xi=C/E^2$ of the ray are discontinued at the shell. Utilizing this transformation, we study the shadow of this spacetime and the corresponding images from an equatorial thin accretion disk. The presence of the shell gives rise to distinctive features in the observed images. Notably, we observe distinct double photon rings in the images, which can gradually merge into a single ring. Moreover, the shadow boundaries and the photon rings do not exhibit a one-to-one correspondence. The abrupt changes in redshift factor and the truncated photon regions profoundly influence the image, producing distinctive features such as the step-like structures. These features in shell-equipped spacetimes can help evaluate, through future astronomical observations, the applicability of the Israel junction condition and the shell model in real astrophysical systems.",

Bouman General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) With the success of static black-hole imaging, the next frontier is the dynamic and 3D imaging of black holes. Recovering the dynamic 3D gas near a black hole would reveal previously-unseen parts of the universe and inform new physics models. However, only sparse radio measurements from a single viewpoint are possible, making the dynamic 3D reconstruction problem significantly ill-posed. Previously, BH-NeRF addressed the ill-posed problem by assuming Keplerian dynamics of the gas, but this assumption breaks down near the black hole, where the strong gravitational pull of the black hole and increased electromagnetic activity complicate fluid dynamics. To overcome the restrictive assumptions of BH-NeRF, we propose PI-DEF, a physics-informed approach that uses differentiable neural rendering to fit a 4D (time + 3D) emissivity field given EHT measurements. Our approach jointly reconstructs the 3D velocity field with the 4D emissivity field and enforces the velocity as a soft constraint on the dynamics of the emissivity. In experiments on simulated data, we find significantly improved reconstruction accuracy over both BH-NeRF and a physics-agnostic approach. We demonstrate how our method may be used to estimate other physics parameters of the black hole, such as its spin.",

We identify the phase averaging mechanism as the physical origin of this stability, demonstrating that the spatial integration of the wave equation efficiently attenuates ultraviolet geometric details below the resolution limit of the probing wavelength. Building on the scaling law $\\mathcal{M} \\propto \\epsilon^2$ and the characteristic mismatch profile with respect to $L_c$, we propose a geometric selection rule for observability: a detectable signal imposes a strict dual constraint requiring both macroscopic spatial coherence ($L_c \\sim M$) and classical-level intensity ($\\epsilon \\gtrsim 10^{-4}$). This criterion quantitatively rules out the observability of incoherent, high-entropy quantum foam, suggesting that any significant ringdown deviation would serve as definitive evidence for macroscopically coherent horizon structures.",

      "abstract": "Quantum Field Theory of Black Hole Perturbations with Backreaction V. Beyond Second Order Perturbations Jonas Neuser, Thomas Thiemann General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Black hole perturbation theory beyond second order is not well understood because typically one defines the meaning of gauge invariance order by order which is ambiguous. In this series of works we therefore developed a new approach which disentangles the meaning of gauge invariance from the perturbative order. It is based on the reduced phase space approach to the Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity and constructs a non-perturbative, albeit implicit, formulation of the dynamics of only observables that are gauge invariant to all orders. To obtain explicit expressions, perturbation theory is then employed, but now only perturbations are considered that are gauge invariant to all orders. There are both spherically symmetric and non-symmetric observables and the formulation takes the (perturbative) backreaction between those fully into account. The formulation has access to both the exterior and interior of the dynamical horizon. In previous papers of this series we have introduced the general formalism and performed consistency checks with second order results obtained in other approaches. The real virtue of our approach starts emerging at higher than second order where we expect differences from previous works both due to backreaction effects and because we work with observables that are gauge invariant to all orders, not only up to a given order. In this paper, we consider the third order. Also new to our approach is that we start from a non-perturbative, namely polynomial, version of the constraints which therefore are finite polynomials in all degrees of freedom before reducing, rather than an infinite series. This allows for an exact and non-perturbative, while implicit, solution of the constraints which does not need to truncate the series and thus is of tremendous technical advantage.",

      "abstract": "Does fermionic entanglement always outperform bosonic entanglement in dilaton black hole? Wen-Mei Li, Jianbo Lu, Shu-Min Wu General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph) It has traditionally been believed that fermionic entanglement generally outperforms bosonic entanglement in relativistic frameworks, and that bosonic entanglement experiences sudden death in extreme gravitational environments. In this study, we analyze the genuine N-partite entanglement, measured by negativity, of bosonic and fermionic GHZ states, focusing on scenarios where a subset of $m$ ($m<N$) constituents interacts with Hawking radiation generated by a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilaton black hole. Surprisingly, we find that quantum entanglement between the non-gravitational and gravitational modes for the bosonic field is stronger than that in the same modes for the fermionic field within dilaton spacetime. This study challenges the traditional belief that ``fermionic entanglement always outperforms bosonic entanglement\" in the relativistic framework. However, quantum entanglement between the gravitational modes and the combined gravitational and non-gravitational modes is weaker for the bosonic field than for the fermionic field in the presence of a dilaton black hole. Finally, the connection between the global N-partite entanglement in the bosonic field and that in the fermionic field is influenced by the gravitational field's intensity. Our study reveals the intrinsic relationship between quantum entanglement of bosonic and fermionic fields in curved spacetime from a new perspective, and provides theoretical guidance for selecting appropriate field-based quantum resources for relativistic quantum information tasks under extreme gravitational conditions.",

This investigation is motivated by the fact that Mercury's post-Newtonian gravitational field (as well as that of any other planet) admits an expansion in terms of multipole moments, which are most appropriately defined in the local reference system. The equations of motion in the Mercury-centric local frame include relativistic local perturbations, given by the Schwarzschild term, Lense-Thirring precession, and the acceleration due to the quadrupole moment, and relativistic third-body perturbations, which are the gravito-electric and gravito-magnetic accelerations, along with a coupling term between Mercury and other solar system bodies. The relativistic third-body perturbations are usually neglected in all practical applications. In this study, we analyze the magnitude of the post-Newtonian terms of the equations of motion formulated in the Mercury-centric frame, evaluating them along the trajectories of the two BepiColombo spacecrafts. Based on this analysis, we provide a practical approach for constructing a high-accuracy relativistic orbital model suitable for a Mercury orbiter.",

Submitted to Phys. Rev. D General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We introduce a new factorized and resummed waveform for circularized, nonspinning, compact binaries that leverages on the solution of the Teukolsky equation once mapped into a confluent Heun equation. The structure of the solution allows one to identify new resummed factors that completely absorb all test-mass logarithms and transcendental numbers via exponentials and $\\Gamma$-functions at any post-Newtonian (PN) order. The corresponding residual relativistic and phase corrections are thus polynomial with rational coefficients, that are in fact PN-truncated hypergeometric functions. Our approach complements the recent proposal of Ivanov et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135 (2025) 14, 141401], notably recovering the corresponding renormalization group scaling of multipole moments from first principles and fixing the scaling constant. In the test mass limit, our approach (pushed up to 10PN) yields waveforms and fluxes that are globally more accurate than those obtained using the standard factorized approach of Damour et al. [Phys. Rev. D 79 (2009), 064004]. The method generalizes straightforwardly to comparable mass binaries implementing the new concept of universal anomalous dimension of multipole moments and might be eventually useful to improve current state of the art effective-one-body waveform models for coalescing binaries.",

We derive analytical expressions for the energy and angular momentum of stable equatorial circular orbits, along with the corresponding radial and latitudinal oscillation frequencies, as functions of $M$, $a$, and $B$. We also examine the key features of the quasi-periodic oscillations of test particles near stable circular orbits, including the precession effects such as periastron precession and the Lense-Thirring effect. Finally, we compare our results with those corresponding to the Kerr BH. We find that particle motion is strongly shaped by the BH parameters. Using a WKB approach, we also study scalar quasinormal modes of a rotating KBR BH in an external magnetic field and show that the magnetic field increases damping, while rotation and angular momentum mainly set the oscillation frequencies. Alternatively, general relativistic modelling of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion onto a rapidly rotating KBR BH shows that two distinct physical structures emerge and cyclically transform into one another over time. These processes produce either a strongly oscillating flip-flop shock cone or a nearly stationary toroidal structure, with their formation governed by the black hole spin and magnetic curvature. Power spectral analysis shows that these configurations give rise to low and high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations, offering a unified explanation for the multiple quasi-periodic oscillations observed in rapidly spinning X--ray binaries.",

The model naturally resolves the initial singularity resulting in an infinite number of smooth non-singular bounces, while accommodating a phase of accelerated expansion driven by a scalar field rolling at a constant rate. The presence of a timelike extra dimension induces high-energy corrections to the effective Friedmann dynamics, allowing anisotropic shear to be dynamically suppressed near the bounce and rendering the background evolution stable. We derive the full background dynamics analytically and demonstrate that uniform-rate inflation can be consistently embedded within an anisotropic braneworld framework. Primordial scalar and tensor perturbations are analysed using the $\\delta N$ formalism, ensuring that only physically relevant modes exiting the horizon during inflation contribute to observable quantities. Remarkably, we find that observational consistency can be achieved with different levels of anisotropy in the two different scenarios we consider, without compromising the smoothness or stability of the bounce. Our results establish uniform-rate inflation on an anisotropic braneworld as a robust and observationally viable alternative to standard inflationary cosmology, offering a compelling framework in which non-singular early-universe dynamics and precision cosmology can be consistently unified.",

Penrose and S. Hawking from the 1960s show that, given a pointwise energy condition (and some causality as well as initial assumptions), spacetimes cannot be geodesically complete. Despite their great success, the theorems leave room for physically relevant improvements, especially regarding the classical energy conditions as essentially any quantum field theory necessarily violates them. While singularity theorems with weakened energy conditions exist for worldline integral bounds, so called worldvolume bounds are in some cases more applicable than the worldline ones, such as the case of some massive free fields. In this paper we study integral Ricci curvature bounds based on worldvolume quantum strong energy inequalities. Under the additional assumption of a - potentially very negative - global timelike Ricci curvature bound, a Hawking type singularity theorem is proven.

Existing algorithms that conduct the localizations are not optimized for eccentric sources. We use a semi-Bayesian technique to carry out localizations of simulated sources recovered using a matched-filter search. Through these simulations, we find that if a non-negligible eccentricity is obtained during the detection, an eccentricity-optimized algorithm can significantly improve the localization areas compared to the existing methods. We also lay out the foundation for an eccentric early-warning system using the matched-filter search. The potential impact on the early-warning localization is investigated. We indicate a few possible cases of improvements while accounting for eccentricity toward any detectable eccentric neutron star binaries in the forthcoming observing scenarios of ground-based detectors. Improved localizations can be useful in effectually utilizing the capabilities of the follow-up facilities.",

We adopt a specific ansatz for the background geometry corresponding to a singularity-free space-time. We obtain an expression for the connection, which allows the derivation of solutions for any $f(Q)$ theory in this context. Our approach aims to address a recurring error appearing in the literature, where even when a connection compatible with spherical symmetry is adopted, the field equation for the connection is systematically omitted and not checked if it is satisfied. For the stellar configuration, we concentrate on the power-law model $f(Q)=Q+\\alpha Q_{0}\\left( \\frac{Q}{Q_{0}}\\right) ^{\\nu }$. The de Sitter-Schwarzschild geometry naturally emerges as an attractor beyond a certain radius, we thus utilize it as the external solution beyond the boundary of the star.

For this purpose, we use the parameterization of the EoS parameter in the form $\\omega(z) = \\frac{\\omega_{0}}{(z+1)} $ to derive the explicit solution of the field equations in Rastall gravity. We constrained the cosmological parameters for the derived model by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach utilizing OHD, BAO, and Pantheon plus compilation of SN Ia datasets. We also constrained the model parameters using deep learning techniques and the CoLFI Python package. This paper introduces an innovative deep-learning approach for parameter inference. The deep learning method significantly surpasses the MCMC technique regarding optimal fit values, parameter uncertainties, and relationships among parameters. This conclusion is drawn from a comparative analysis of the two methodologies. Additionally, we determined the transition redshift $z_t = 0.941$, which signifies the shift in the Universe's model from an early deceleration phase to the present acceleration phase. The diagnosis of the model with diagnostic tools like statefinders, jerk parameter, and $O_m$ diagnostics are presented and analyzed.

The analysis of the shadow reveals a dependence on the density parameter of fluid matter $k$, with larger shadow sizes for larger values of $k$ in the dark matter and dust cases, while the shadow size becomes smaller in the radiation case. Notably, dark matter induces more visible deformations compared to radiation or dust, thereby highlighting its distinct imprint on shadow curves. We also find that dark matter reduces the real part of the QNM frequencies and significantly increases the damping time, enhancing the prospects for gravitational wave detection. The variations in spin parameter $a$, density parameter $k$ and multipole number $l$ are investigated. The analysis confirms the significant role of dark matter in modifying the behavior of QNMs, providing a promising avenue for future experiments.",

Similarly, the past and right Rindler wedges are also entangled. We propose a protocol to extract this entanglement using two two-state detectors located in the past and right Rindler wedges. By scaling the detector transition frequencies inversely with Minkowski time, entanglement from the quantum field is transferred to the detectors, suggesting they may support quantum teleportation via the vacuum. Our protocol can be implemented with current quantum systems, such as flux-tunable transmon qubits.

While previous work has demonstrated the general capability of numerical-relativity frameworks to evolve spacetimes with $N$ black holes, detailed explorations of such encounters remain limited. We focus on scenarios involving initially non-spinning, equal-mass black holes that result in a variety of dynamical outcomes, including flybys, delayed or accelerated eccentric mergers, exchanges, and more complex interactions. Our results show that we can reliably simulate scattering experiments involving three and four black holes, which exhibit interesting dynamics and gravitational-wave signals. The dynamics of these systems show noticeable differences compared to analogous systems in post-Newtonian approximations up to 2.5PN. A key result is that the gravitational waveforms exhibit remarkable features that could potentially make them distinguishable from regular binary mergers.",

While they are not currently utilized for GW detection, interferometric detectors also feature narrow bands of strong sensitivity at higher frequencies where the sideband fields created by a GW are resonantly amplified in the optical system. Small changes to system parameters allow the narrow band of high sensitivity to be scanned over a much larger range of frequencies. In this paper, we investigate whether simply modifying the detuning angle of the signal-recycling mirror of the GEO600 interferometer can make this experiment sensitive to GWs in the kilohertz frequency range. We compute the strain sensitivity for GEO600 across a frequency range from several kHz to tens of kHz for various detuning angles. We also show that LIGO cannot attain the same effect assuming that the optical components are not changed due to the narrow band response of the Fabry-Perot cavities. We then calculate the sensitivity of GEO600 to various proposed high-frequency GW sources and compare it to the sensitivity of other ground-based detectors.",

Imposing regularity at the origin and asymptotic flatness uniquely fixes the integration constants, yielding potentials fully determined by the mass density.

Accepted for publication in General Relativity and Gravitation General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We develop extended black-hole thermodynamics on a Dvali--Gabadadze--Porrati (DGP) brane by promoting the brane tension $\\sigma$ to a thermodynamic variable within the extended Iyer--Wald framework. The brane tension acts as a localized vacuum energy with pressure $P_\\sigma \\equiv -\\sigma$, yielding a new work term $V_\\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}P_\\sigma$ in the first law and the corresponding Smarr relation. For static, spherically symmetric black holes we show that the conjugate volume equals the geometric volume $V_\\sigma=\\tfrac{4\\pi}{3}r_h^3$; for stationary, axisymmetric solutions it admits a covariant, slice-independent definition and evaluates to $V_\\sigma=\\tfrac{4\\pi}{3}\\!\\left(r_+^3+a^2 r_+\\right)$. Working on the ghost-free normal branch, the brane is asymptotically flat with a single horizon, so the construction avoids de Sitter obstructions.

Modeling these systems requires evolving the coupled dynamics of the binary and the dark matter. This also requires setting reasonable initial conditions for the dark-matter distribution, which itself relies upon understanding the formation history of these systems. In this paper, we investigate how two aspects of these systems' formation histories shape the dark-matter distribution: accretion onto the primary and prior merger events. We model accretion by introducing a minimum allowed angular momentum of dark-matter particles, which removes such particles that would have been accreted by the primary. When simulating an inspiral within such a distribution, we find a smaller dephasing of the gravitational-wave signal from a vacuum binary as compared to an inspiral without such a cutoff, particularly for more extreme mass-ratios. We also simulate an inspiral which takes place within a dark-matter distribution that remains after a prior merger. We find that the decrease in dephasing from vacuum binaries when compared to the prior inspiral is most significant for less extreme mass-ratios. Nevertheless, the environmental effects from the dark matter for these different cases of initial data are still expected to be measurable by future space-based detectors.",

D 113, 044016 (2026) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Long-term numerical relativity (NR) simulations of binary black hole (BBH) systems in the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC) code exhibit an unexpected exponential drift of the center-of-mass (CoM) away from the simulation's origin. In our work, we analyze this phenomenon and demonstrate that it is not a physical effect but rather a manifestation of a gauge artifact. The origin of this drift is the reflection of the gauge waves off the outer boundary of the computational domain. These reflections are introduced by inaccuracies in the gauge boundary condition, specifically, the application of the Sommerfeld condition to the time derivative of the gauge fields. Such an approach fails to completely suppress or correctly absorb the outgoing modes, thereby generating artificial feedback into the simulation. To mitigate this problem, we introduce a modified boundary condition that incorporates an explicit CoM correction source term designed to counteract the CoM motion. Our numerical experiments, performed with the SpEC code, reveal that this new boundary treatment reduces the CoM drift by several orders of magnitude compared to the standard implementation, and does not introduce any unwanted physical artifacts.",

In general, such WH+NS systems contain ghosts; however, these ghosts can be eliminated. We find that the wormhole remains traversable regardless of whether anisotropy of the neutron fluid and/or magnetic fields are included. In particular, the null energy condition (NEC) remains violated in the vicinity of the wormhole throat, ensuring the traversable nature of the geometry. For magnetized configurations, the resulting WH+NS systems can become extremely massive, with ADM masses exceeding $8\\,M_\\odot$, and can exhibit large surface redshifts exceeding $z \\simeq 1.5$. Furthermore, we analyze the gravitational-wave echo time of the systems, which serves as a potential observational imprint. Our results indicate that the echo time can vary depending on the fluid anisotropy and the magnetic field configuration, suggesting that WH+NS systems may provide distinctive signals of gravitational echo.",

Using extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) as high-precision probes, we investigate the imprints of this LQG deformation in the surrounding spacetime. Waveforms generated via an improved augmented analytic kludge (AAK) model in both LQG black hole backgrounds and in Schwarzschild spacetime are compared through a faithfulness analysis. This allows us to quantify the detectability of the deviation with LISA and to derive constraints on $\\zeta$ based on a detection threshold. We find that the first LQG black hole model produces significantly stronger signatures in EMRI signals than the second, making its quantum gravity effects more accessible to future space-borne gravitational-wave detection.",

V2: typos fixed General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Due to the non-renormalizability of gravity, the perturbative expansion has sense, say, for its discrete simplicial (Regge calculus) version. A finite-difference form of gravity action has diffeomorphism symmetry at leading order over metric variations from site to site, and we add a term bilinear in $n^\\lambda(g_{\\lambda\\mu}-g_{\\lambda \\mu}^{(0)})$, $n^\\lambda=[1,-\\varepsilon(\\Delta^{(s)\\alpha}\\Delta^{(s)}_\\alpha)^{-1}\\Delta^{(s)\\beta}]$, to \"softly\" fix the synchronous gauge $g_{0\\lambda}=g_{0\\lambda}^{(0)}=-\\delta_{0\\lambda}$ at $\\varepsilon\\to0$, thus removing singularities at $p_0=0$. For the symmetric derivative $\\Delta^{(s)}_\\lambda$, the propagator has a graviton pole at $\\sin^2p_0=\\sum^3_{\\alpha=1}\\sin^2p_\\alpha$ or, at small $p_\\alpha$, at $p_0$ close to 0 or $\\pm \\pi$. This pole doubling compared to the continuum does not arise from $\\sin^2(p_0/2)=\\sum^3_{\\alpha=1}\\sin^2(p_\\alpha/2)$ obtained from the action $\\check{S}_{\\rm g}$ with the usual derivative $\\Delta_\\lambda = \\exp (ip_\\lambda)-1$ instead of $\\Delta^{(s)}_\\lambda=i\\sin p_\\lambda$ in some terms, including in the k part of some term, and $\\Delta^{(s)}_\\lambda$ in the 1-k part of that term. Given the propagator $\\check{G}(n,\\overline{n})$, we form a principal value type propagator $[\\check{G}(n,n)+\\check{G}(\\overline{n},\\overline{n})]/2$ by analytically continuing from real $n=\\overline{n}$. Singularities are roughly resolved as $p_0^{-j}\\Rightarrow[(p_0+i\\varepsilon)^{-j}+(p_0-i\\varepsilon)^{-j}]/2$ leading to separate diagram finiteness at $\\varepsilon\\to0$. We find that k=1 is needed for this prescription to work properly and match the continuum case. The gauge-fixing term needed for this propagator and its finiteness are considered, the ghost contribution is found to vanish at $\\varepsilon\\to0$. We use these results in arXiv:2601.03228. Calculations are illustrated by the electromagnetic (Yang-Mills) case.",

Searches for gravitational-wave signals in the detector data are prone to spurious disturbances of terrestrial origin. The technique presented here benefits from the fact that the noise effects are generally non-coincident in time at geographically separated detectors. Therefore, abnormally loud detector triggers that are not time-coincident can be vetoed. We implement the veto technique in a matched-filter search for transient signals from binary black holes and observe search backgrounds to be generally close to the Gaussian limit. An improvement in the sensitivity of the search is demonstrated using simulated signals. The technique is expected to especially improve the detection efficiency of the search for short duration gravitational waves.",

Compared to our paper arXiv:2306.11531, the result of integration over connection for the functional integral contribution from this gauge is known in closed form without model assumptions. For details of consistency with continuum theory (including no graviton pole doubling), a refined finite-difference action form is used. V2: typos fixed General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) This paper develops our work on the consequences of the Regge calculus, where some edge length scale arises as an optimal starting point of the perturbative expansion with taking into account a bell-shaped form of the measure obtained using functional integration over connection. A \"hypercubic\" structure is considered (some variables are frozen), it is described by the metric $g_{\\lambda \\mu}$ at the sites. The metric is parameterized to make the measure Lebesgue. The linear part of this parametrization leads to a discrete form of Feynman diagrams that approximates finite continuum diagrams and is finite for infinite ones; the nonlinear part gives new vertices and diagrams. The edge length scale as some maximum point of the measure is $\\sim \\eta^{1 / 2}$, where $\\eta$ defines the free factor like $ ( - \\det \\| g_{\\lambda \\mu} \\| )^{ \\eta / 2}$ in the measure and should be a large parameter to ensure true action upon integration over connection. A priori, the perturbative expansion may contain increasing powers of $\\eta$, but this does not happen for the starting point inside some neighborhood of the maximum point of the measure, and it does happen outside this neighborhood. This appears to be a dynamic mechanism for establishing the edge length scale. We use a discrete version of the soft synchronous gauge in the principal value type prescription we discuss in the recent paper arXiv:2601.02181. This allows one to fix the timelike length scale at a low level for which the measure is known in closed form. This gauge is considered together with a refined finite-difference form of the action to match the analytical properties of the propagator to the continuum case.",

Sharov General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Two $F(R)$ gravity models are tested on the basis of their viability during all stages of cosmological evolution. It is shown that these models can describe both the early-time inflationary epoch and the dark energy epoch. The models are confronted with the latest observational data, including the Pantheon+ catalogue with Type Ia supernovae, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations, the Hubble parameter estimations and data from cosmic microwave background radiation. Investigation of the viability conditions for these models, in particular, the condition $\\frac{dF}{dR}>0$ required a deep analysis. Both models appeared to be viable during the early-time era, but for the late-time evolution the viability conditions are not fulfilled in definite domains in the parameter spaces of these models. However the best fitted parameters, determined in confrontation with the mentioned observational data, lie far from the forbidden domains for both models. These $F(R)$ gravity models describe the observations with the large advantage over the $\\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model, not only in $\\chi^2$ statistics, but also with Akaike and Bayesian information criteria. This success of the two $F(R)$ gravity scenarios is connected with their capability to mimic dynamical dark energy, similarly to models with variable equation of state, that is necessary for describing the latest Pantheon+ and DESI observational data.",

Future observatories such as LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, are expected to observe previously undetectable fundamental physics effects in signals predicted by General Relativity (GR).One particularly interesting such signal is associated to the displacement memory effect, which corresponds to a permanent deformation of spacetime due to the passage of gravitational radiation. In this work, we explore the ability of LISA to observe and characterize this effect. In order to do this, we use state-of-the-art simulations of the LISA instrument, and we perform a Bayesian analysis to assess the detectability and establish general conditions to claim detection of the displacement memory effect from individual massive black hole binary (MBHB) merger events in LISA. We perform parameter estimation both to explore the impact of the displacement memory effect and to reconstruct its amplitude. We discuss the precision at which such a reconstruction can be obtained thus opening the way to tests of GR and alternative theories. To provide astrophysical context, we apply our analysis to black hole binary populations models and estimate the rates at which the displacement memory effect could be observed within the LISA planned lifetime.",
