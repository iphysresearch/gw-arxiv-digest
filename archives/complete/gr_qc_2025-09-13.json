      "abstract": "Scalar quasinormal modes of magnetically charged black holes in a quintessence field Ali Hasnain General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We investigate the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum for scalar perturbations of static, magnetically charged black holes in the presence of a quintessence field. The background geometry is obtained from the Einstein-Power-Maxwell action with a Kiselev-type contribution for quintessence. The associated master wave equation is solved using complementary numerical approaches, including high-order WKB expansions, the asymptotic iteration method, and time-domain integration, with cross-validation to ensure accuracy. The results show that magnetic charge generally lowers the oscillation frequency of fundamental modes, while the quintessence parameter modifies damping timescales. A dedicated analysis of the metric's derivation confirms the correct form of the magnetic charge term. We explore a theoretical parameter space to understand the mathematical behavior of the solution, including extreme regimes not intended to represent astrophysical realities. The computed scalar field spectra provide a foundational study for future work on gravitational perturbations. All numerical data and codes are provided to ensure reproducibility.",

      "abstract": "Systematic errors in fast relativistic waveforms for Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals Hassan Khalvati, Philip Lynch, Ollie Burke, Lorenzo Speri, Maarten van de Meent, Zachary Nasipak General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Accurate modeling of Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) is essential for extracting reliable information from future space-based gravitational wave observatories. Fast waveform generation frameworks adopt an offline/online architecture, where expensive relativistic computations (e.g. self-force and black hole perturbation theory) are performed offline, and waveforms are generated rapidly online via interpolation across a multidimensional parameter space. In this work, we investigate potential sources of error that result in systematic bias in these relativistic waveform models, focusing on radiation-reaction fluxes. Two key sources of systematics are identified: (i) the intrinsic inaccuracy of the flux data, for which we focus on the truncation of the multipolar mode sum, and (ii) interpolation errors from transitioning to the online stage. We quantify the impact of mode-sum truncation and analyze interpolation errors by using various grid structures and interpolation schemes. For circular orbits in Kerr spacetime with spins larger than $a \\geq 0.9$, we find that $\\ell_{\\text{max}} \\geq 30$ is required for the necessary accuracy. We also develop an efficient Chebyshev interpolation scheme, achieving the desired accuracy level with significantly fewer grid points compared to spline-based methods. For circular orbits in Kerr spacetimes, we demonstrate via Bayesian studies that interpolating the flux to a maximum global relative error that is equal to the small mass ratio is sufficient for parameter estimation purposes. For 4-year long quasi-circular EMRI signals with SNRs$= \\mathcal{O}(100)$ and mass-ratios $10^{-4}-10^{-6}$, a global relative error of $10^{-6}$ yields mismatches $<10^{-3}$ and negligible parameter estimation biases.",

We analyze merger waves from comparable-mass and extreme-mass-ratio binaries, obtained from numerical relativity and black-hole perturbation theory, respectively, and argue that they are dominated by the prompt wave emissions as the black holes collide. This signal, which we refer to as the direct wave, is modulated by the plunging motion and selectively screened by the gravitational potential of the remnant black hole. The direct wave typically exhibits a time-dependent frequency and decay rate, but for high-spin remnants $(\\gtrsim0.7)$ the ergosphere renders it mode-like, with a quasi-stable instantaneous oscillation frequency close to the superradiant frequency. We further estimate its detectability in a GW150914-like system and find that the signal-to-noise ratio can exceed $\\sim 10$ with the current ground-based detector network. Our results therefore identify the direct wave as a robust observable for analyzing black hole ringdowns in current and future gravitational wave events.",

Medeiros General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We construct a higher-order gravity model including all corrections up to mass dimension six. Starting from the Jordan frame, we derive the field equations and specialize to the FLRW background, where the dynamics take the form of a four-dimensional autonomous system. Focusing on the $R+R^{2}+RR_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu}$ case, we obtain linearized equations in the parameter $\\gamma_{0}$ and analyze the resulting phase space. The model exhibits the main desirable features of an inflationary regime, with a slow-roll attractor and a stable critical point corresponding to the end of inflation. Analytical expressions for the scalar spectral index $n_{s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ show that the model is consistent with Planck, BICEP/Keck, and BAO data if $|\\gamma_{0}|\\lesssim 10^{-3}$. Moreover, negative values of $\\gamma_{0}$ restore compatibility with recent ACT, Planck and DESI results, suggesting that higher-order corrections may play a relevant role in refining inflationary cosmology.",

This set-up postulates a five-dimensional ghost-free massive graviton with a brane-localized four-dimensional massive gravity potential, and has the virtue of raising the strong-coupling scale of the 4D theory. We identify two classes of models that lead to decoupled equations for the scale factor on the brane: one characterized by a particular choice of boundary conditions for the StÃ¼ckelberg fields and one characterized by a special tuning between the coefficients of the 5D and 4D potentials. In the first case, we find interesting solutions including a cosmological bounce without the need of exotic matter. The second case leads to a modified Friedmann equation, and comparison with data shows the potential of the model to alleviate the Hubble tension.",

This gravitational theory results in general relativity plus a geometric Proca field. Building on our previous work, where we constructed its static spherically symmetric solutions in the Anti-de Sitter (AdS) background (Eur. Phys. J. C 83(4):318, 2023), we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the system's thermodynamics. We examine the thermodynamic properties of the Einstein-Geometric Proca AdS compact objects, focusing on the Hawking temperature, enthalpy, heat capacity, entropy, and Gibbs free energy. Particular attention is given to the dependence of the Hawking temperature, enthalpy, and heat capacity on the uniform potential $q_{1}$ and the electromagnetic-type charge $q_{2}$. Through numerical analysis we compute the entropy and Gibbs free energy and investigate how these quantities vary with the model parameters.",

We simulate the formation of these gravitational molecules, determine their co-moving regions, and compute ionization fluxes induced by orbital motion for various binary eccentricities. We develop semi-analytic formalisms to describe the ionization dynamics of both the co-moving and non-co-moving regions, demonstrating consistency with numerical simulation results. From ionization fluxes, we estimate their backreaction on binary orbital evolution. At early stages, molecule ionization can dominate over gravitational wave emission, producing a spectral turnover in the gravitational wave background. Additionally, ionization of the co-moving component occurs solely due to binary eccentricity, causing orbital circularization.",

However, equivalence principle is not violated. Then we calculate the horizon brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) entropy for this black hole geometry. We observed that the HBAR entropy has the form similar to that of Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy however it has been observed that it is also influenced by Lorentz violation associated to the Bumblebee theory.

The universality of this notion is highlighted by the Raychaudhuri equation (RE), which is independent of any theory of gravity and contains the Ricci tensor $R_{\\mu\\nu}$ as a key ingredient, thereby connecting spacetime geometry with matter-energy content. Under small metric perturbations, $R_{\\mu\\nu} \\propto \\Box h_{\\mu\\nu}$, where $h_{\\mu\\nu}$ is the perturbation, indicating that various gravity theories, via their corresponding $R_{\\mu\\nu}$, produce different gravitational wave equations. In the framework of Einstein's gravity, this leads to the standard wave equation. This study analyzes a modified form, {\\it GW-inspired RE}, within the homogeneous and isotropic FLRW background to investigate late-time cosmic acceleration and structure formation. We employ {\\it Pantheon+ SNe Ia, Hubble, and BAO} datasets to constrain model parameters through Bayesian inference utilizing NUTS in {\\it NumPyro}. A nuisance parameter $\\mu_0$ is introduced to address residual systematics.

We analyze the redshift evolution of the deceleration parameter, $q(z)$, both with and without $\\mu_0$, emphasizing its influence on cosmic dynamics. The GW-inspired RE is reformulated as a harmonic oscillator, providing insight into expansion and geodesic focusing. A graphical comparison demonstrates the relationship $d^{GW}_L(z) = d^{EM}_L(z)$ utilizing GWOSC data.

Through this approach, fermionic degrees of freedom are effectively incorporated into a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model with a scalar field. By applying a kind of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, solutions to the Dirac equation for an approximate potential characteristic of type IV singularities are obtained, expressed in terms of Tricomi confluent hypergeometric functions and associated Laguerre polynomials. The elimination of non-physical, divergent solutions results in a quantum regularization of the classical singularity.

      "abstract": "Scalar and vector modes in inflation with antisymmetric tensor field Abhijith Ajith, Sukanta Panda General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We investigate the scalar and vector modes arising from cosmological perturbations within the framework of an inflationary scenario driven by an antisymmetric tensor field, minimally coupled to gravity. After eliminating gauge artifacts, there remain four scalar and six vector modes of interest which can be studied separately. We analyze the stability of these modes, while looking for generic instabilities like ghost and gradient instabilities that could potentially plague the theory. Further, we investigate the evolution of these modes across different regimes, particularly subhorizon and superhorizon scales.",
