The conversion rate is a sharp function of the photon frequency in the wall rest frame, vanishing above the ultraviolet cutoff of the top form sector. Partial cloaking may also induce a rotation of the polarization of transmitted light of order $\\Delta\\vartheta \\sim 10^{-3}$ radians, modify the cosmic microwave background power spectrum, and violate Etherington's reciprocity relation at low frequencies. These effects can impact cosmological determinations of the Hubble rate.",

Wolfe, Matthew Mould, John Veitch, Salvatore Vitale 14+6 pages, 9+2 figures; comments welcome! Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) As gravitational-wave catalogs grow, they will become increasingly computationally expensive to analyze in their entirety, especially when inferring astrophysical source populations with high-dimensional, flexible models. Bayesian statistics offers a natural remedy, letting us update our knowledge of physical models as new data arrive, without re-analyzing existing data. However, doing so requires the posterior probability density of model parameters for previous observations, which is typically intractable. Here, we use variational neural posterior estimation to rapidly update the inferred population of binary black holes as data are observed in gravitational-wave detectors. We apply this approach to real and simulated catalogs analyzed with both low- and high-dimensional population models, testing the reliability of three update cadences: with new catalogs of sources, month by month during an observing run, and as each new signal arrives. We investigate the success and failure modes of neural sequential updates, finding that the robustness of updating is sensitive to the information contained in each update and that updating is most effective when performed with larger segments of data. We outline one additional scientific application enabled by Bayesian updating: identification of events that are individually informative about the population. Neural Bayesian updates to astrophysical population models also provide efficient likelihood representations for joint analyses with other data, e.g., standard-siren cosmology, and similar methods can be used to perform Bayesian stochastic background searches.",

Unlike standard mechanisms relying on classical dynamics or modified actions, this enhancement originates from the reduced density matrix of the observable sector after tracing over a hidden gravitational reservoir. This framework allows for a sizable tensor-to-scalar ratio r > 0.01 consistent with sub-Planckian inflaton excursions, providing a purely quantum mechanical evasion of the Lyth bound. The resulting mixed state leaves a distinctive \"quantum birthmark\" in the form of oscillatory features in the power spectrum and a characteristic violation of the single-field consistency relation, manifesting as a scale-dependent enhancement of the squeezed-limit bispectrum. Furthermore, we forecast that this entanglement may manifest as a late-time stochastic noise enhancement in gravitational wave interferometers, offering a novel experimental window into the quantum nature of spacetime.",

While all matter contributes to the gravitational potential, electromagnetic effects were traditionally expected to cancel in large systems because positive and negative charges balance. Yet astrophysical objects clearly show long range electromagnetic behavior, so the cancellation cannot be perfect. This paper develops a model for stationary aggregation of matter into a star that consistently includes angular momentum and electromagnetic effects. We reformulate the standard polytropic stellar model as a variational problem and extend it to include the kinetic energy of rigid rotation and the electromagnetic interaction energy between oppositely charged baryonic matter. The electromagnetic contribution to the action is taken to be the minimal energy required to generate the stellar magnetic dipole moment. This energy has two parts: the pure electromagnetic contribution, expressible as a surface integral, and the free energy difference between magnetized and unmagnetized matter, obtained by analyzing a degenerate electron gas in a background of cold ions. Differential forms provide a convenient mathematical framework. The resulting model incorporates electromagnetic effects into stellar structure in a way consistent with linearized general relativity. Although the full system forms a complex open boundary problem, exact solutions exist under simplifying assumptions. The phase diagram predicted by the simplified model shows patterns that may motivate further study of the balance between matter, gravitation, and electromagnetism",

An analytical model of the general relativistic gravitomagnetic Lense-Thirring precession of the effective orbit of a fictitious test particle revolving about a spinning primary can explain the observed precessional features. It yields allowed regions in the system's parameter space which, as far as the hole's dimensionless spin parameter is concerned, are essentially in agreement with those obtained in the literature with general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. The present analytical approach can be extended to include the precession due to the hole's quadrupole mass moment as well. It breaks the degeneracy in the allowed regions occurring for negative and positive values of the spin parameter when only the Lense-Thirring effect is considered. The best estimate for the hole's mass yields the range $0.185-0.215$ for the dimensionless spin parameter. Using the same strategy with the gravitomagnetic frequency for an extended disk of finite size with a parameterized power-law mass density yields to distinct, generally non-overlapping allowed regions for each value of the power-law index adopted.",

A particularly striking feature of these reconstructions is an apparent transition from an early-time phantom-like regime to a late-time quintessence-like behavior. For positive-definite DE densities, this transition is often phrased as a crossing of the phantom divide line (PDL) at $w(a)=-1$. Allowing the DE density to become negative, however, renders the PDL (in the sense of $w(a)=-1$) non-diagnostic as a global separator: the physically meaningful criterion is instead the null energy condition boundary (NECB), $\\rho_{\\rm DE}+p_{\\rm DE}=0$. We therefore test whether the data-driven preference for NECB-crossing in CPL reconstructions persists once alternative realizations of phantom behavior are admitted, specifically through sign-switching DE densities. To this end, we introduce and constrain two controlled phenomenological extensions of the CPL framework featuring a negative DE phase in the past. In the CPL$\\to-\\Lambda$ model, the switching epoch is tied to the CPL-inferred NECB-crossing scale factor, yielding an early-time negative cosmological-constant phase, while the post-switch evolution follows the CPL branch. In the sCPL model, the CPL equation of state is maintained at all times, while the sign switch in the energy density occurs at an independent transition redshift. We find that late-time BAO and SNeIa data drive the negative-density phase beyond their effective redshift coverage, and that this requirement is the primary driver of the inferred parameter behavior. While both models are statistically disfavored relative to the baseline CPL, admitting a negative DE phase generally reduces the significance of deviations from a cosmological constant.",

D 113, 042004 (2026) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In the gravity quantum theory, the quantization of spacetime may lead to the modification of the dispersion relation between the energy and the momentum and the Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). High energy and long-distance gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observations in the universe provide a unique opportunity to test the possibility of LIV. In this work, we use 88 time delays from GRBs ($0.117 < z < 6.29$), and provide a cosmological model-independent approach based on the luminosity distance data from 174 GRBs to test LIV. Combining the observation data from multiband of GRBs provides us with an opportunity to mitigate the potential systematic errors arising from variations in the physical characteristics among diverse object populations, and to add a higher redshift dataset for testing the energy-dependent velocity caused by the corrected dispersion relationship of photons. These robust limits of the energy scale for the linear and quadratic LIV effects are $E_{\\mathrm{QG},1} \\ge 1.5\\times 10^{15}$ GeV, and $E_{\\mathrm{QG},2} \\ge 8.5\\times 10^{9}$ GeV, respectively. It exhibits a significantly reduced value compared to the energy scale of Planck in both scenarios of linear and quadratic LIV.",

By tracking the non-linear growth of scalar perturbations with both sub-horizon and super-horizon initial wavelengths, we are able to compare their evolution to perturbative results. Our key findings show that in the deep sub-horizon limit, the perturbative behaviour remains valid, whereas in the super-horizon regime, non-linear dynamics exhibit a much richer phenomenology. Finally, we discuss the possibility of primordial black hole formation from the collapse of such perturbations and assess whether this process could serve as a viable mechanism to reheat the universe in the post-inflationary era.",

Such universal relations are of utmost importance as they allow for the imposition of constraints on stellar properties without directly measuring them and they may also serve as a probe of General Relativity. In the present study, we investigated the possible existence of a universal relation between the binding energy of compact stars and the frequency of their non-radial oscillations. The main motivation was related to the fact that both of the aforementioned quantities might be measured in the occurrence of a supernova explosion. Interestingly, we found that there is a empirical relation between the oscillation frequency and the binding energy for both $f$ and $p_1$ modes, assuming hadronic stellar matter. The inclusion of hybrid equations of state, incorporating sharp phase transitions, was shown to result into deviations from the aforementioned quasi-universal relation.",

Within this structure, we derive general one-loop ULPT expressions for the bispectrum and analyze their infrared (IR) behavior, demonstrating exact, nonperturbative IR cancellation and the natural emergence of an IR-resummed description of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) damping. In particular, ULPT enables a detailed and fully analytic treatment of the wiggle-wiggle contribution to the IR-resummed bispectrum, whose structure has remained comparatively unexplored in previous approaches. We further construct IR-resummed models for the cross bispectra of all pre- and post-reconstruction combinations. For configurations in which the displacement fields differ, ULPT captures not only the overall exponential damping but also the more intricate BAO-scale modulation characteristic of mixed pre/post bispectra. Our results clarify the physical origin of nonlinear BAO suppression and provide a compact theoretical framework in which the full ULPT bispectrum, once implemented numerically through displacement-mapping convolution integrals, will automatically encode all nonlinear BAO and IR effects. The framework developed here therefore offers a unified and IR-safe foundation for interpreting next-generation bispectrum measurements.",

Comments are welcome! Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Context: We present the first Cosmological Parameter inferences from eROSITA X-ray observations of galaxy clusters using a Machine Learning algorithm. Methods: We train a Random Forest using mock catalogs of clusters from Magneticum multi-cosmology hydrodynamical simulations. We apply the trained ML algorithm to observed X-ray features (gas luminosity, mass, and temperature) at different redshifts from the eROSITA eFEDS and eRASS1 catalogs. Results: We obtain cosmological constraints with precision comparable to those from standard analyses, such as weak lensing and cluster abundances. We infer $\\Omega_{\\rm m}=0.30^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, $\\sigma_8=0.81\\pm0.01$, and $h_0=0.710\\pm0.004$. The recovered parameters show no tension in the $\\Omega_{\\rm m}-\\sigma_8$ space, but a significant deviation of $h_0$ from the Planck estimates. These inferences remain rather stable against variations of the input observable set and parameter space coverage. These results indicate that correlations among intracluster properties contain cosmological information beyond that encoded in the cluster abundance alone, which can be captured by machine learning trained on multi-cosmology simulations. Conclusions: ML algorithms trained on multi-cosmology hydrodynamical simulations can effectively infer cosmological parameters directly from galaxy cluster data. This is a change of paradigm in the context of cosmological parameter inferences. This approach complements traditional cluster-count analyses and is particularly suited to large upcoming surveys, where systematic uncertainties in mass calibration may otherwise dominate the error budget. It also highlights the potential of large-scale X-ray surveys to deliver independent tests of the standard cosmological model.",

Varga, Balázs Pál, István Szapudi, István Csabai, Till Sawala Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The global topology of the Universe can affect the long-range gravitational forces through the boundary conditions. To study non-trivial topologies in detail, simulations that natively adopt such geometries are required. Cosmological $N$-body simulations typically evolve matter in a periodic cubic box. While numerically convenient, this imposes a non-trivial 3-torus topology that affects long-range gravitational forces, potentially biasing large-scale statistics. We introduce a compactified simulation framework that is only periodic along a single axis, while having infinite topology with isotropic boundary conditions towards the perpendicular directions, i.e. an $\\mathrm{S}^1\\times\\mathbb{R}^2$ (\"slab\") topology. This new simulation geometry is ideal for simulating systems with cylindrical symmetries like filaments or certain anisotropic cosmological models. We compactify comoving space via inverse stereographic projection along the radial direction of a periodic cylinder, and evolve particles with Newtonian dynamics. A smoothly varying spatial and mass resolution with radius suppresses edge artefacts at the free outer boundary. Our implementation in the StePS (STEreographically Projected cosmological Simulations) framework uses a direct $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ force calculation that maps efficiently to GPUs, and Octree $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log N)$ force calculation that can be used on large CPU-clusters. The cylindrical domain's topology enables fully self-consistent simulations in the $\\mathrm{S}^1\\times\\mathbb{R}^2$ manifold and mitigates periodic-image artefacts for targets whose symmetries are mismatched to a cubic box. The main trade-off is radially varying resolution with distinct systematics and analysis requirements. We demonstrate the accuracy of the new simulation method in a standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological simulation.",

In this work, we present a framework to simulate the neutral hydrogen 21cm emission line in such large-scale HI galaxy surveys. This framework is developed as a modular layer that builds on semi-analytical models. In particular we use as bases the Galaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) and L-Galaxies semi-analytical models, coupled to merger trees from the Millennium Simulation suite. We validate our framework against local Universe observations, demonstrating consistency with velocity functions, and generalised Tully-Fisher relations. Predictions based on GAEA and L-Galaxies exhibit mutual consistency despite the distinct underlying physical prescriptions. We construct mock galaxy catalogues that incorporate forward-modelled selection functions, inclination effects, and redshift broadening, reproducing the statistical distributions of HI-selected galaxies in the ALFALFA survey. Finally, we present redshift distribution forecasts for future SKA Observatory HI galaxy surveys.

This, in turn, could mean that the dark matter halo also shares these properties. In this work, by fitting to the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray observations, we test the compatibility of the morphology of the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) from dark matter annihilation with a triaxial dark matter halo. In particular, we consider both untilted triaxial halos and halos whose principal axes are tilted with respect to the Galactic disk. In our fits of the Fermi-LAT data, by testing over a large library of galactic diffuse emission models, we quantify how the halo triaxiality and tilt affect the line-of-sight-integrated annihilation signal and, consequently, the preferred GCE spatial templates. We find that the GCE spectrum and inner cuspiness are robust against variations in the triaxiality and tilt of the dark matter halo. However, in terms of its overall morphology, the GCE in the gamma-ray data can discriminate between choices for the dark matter halo's triaxiality and tilt. Finally, we find that the GCE is more compatible with originating from a triaxial and tilted halo of dark matter than originating from a triaxial and tilted halo of stars, a result important for understanding the GCE's origin.",

Accepted for publication in ApJS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Stellar halos are the only major stellar component of disk galaxies that lack systematic observational characterization, yet they encode critical information about galaxy merger histories. We present the first systematic census of stellar halos in a large, flux-limited sample of 169 high-inclination central galaxies with stellar masses 7.3 <= log Mstar/Msun <= 11.0 and redshift z < 0.1, using HSC-SSP Deep optical images. Stellar halos are detected in 93 galaxies, primarily through their low isophotal ellipticities in the outskirts, improving upon conventional methods of stellar halo identification. The halo detection rate reaches ~ 50% at log Mstar/Msun > 9.9 and >= 70% for Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies. We derive halo surface brightness profiles, colors, and masses, finding that stellar halos generally follow power-law radial profiles. Higher-mass galaxies, on average, exhibit smaller power-law indices and larger halo mass fractions, indicating more extended halos and more active merger histories. A significant stellar halo color-mass correlation, driven mainly by the mass-metallicity relation, suggests dominance by a few massive accretion events. MW-mass galaxies have a median stellar halo fraction of 10% +/- 5%. Among nearby galaxies with halo measurements within 25 Mpc, two thirds (including the MW) lie below the mean stellar halo fraction-galaxy mass relation. Overall, the nearby galaxies show a median halo deficit of ~ 0.3 dex, implying unusually quiescent merger histories. We show that this deficit follows a broader trend in which typical halo fractions increase with heliocentric distance, tracking the gradual rise in matter density toward the cosmic average by z <= 0.07.",

The potential of X-ray variability as a proxy for MBH or for intrinsic LX has led to proposals to use AGN as standard candles to test cosmological models. However, the large intrinsic dispersion in these relations has limited their practical applications. In this work, we investigate the dependence of X-ray variability on AGN physical properties using a sample of 134 Seyfert 1 galaxies from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), which is the largest sample to date, more than three times larger than those used in previous studies. Contrary to earlier findings, we observe that X-ray variability correlates with luminosity just as strongly as with MBH. Furthermore, we still do not find evidence for the expected anti-correlation between variability and Eddington ratio, even when using refined bolometric luminosities from SED fitting to compute the Eddington ratio. From a cosmological perspective, the increased sample size reduces the scatter in the log(L)-log(exvar) relation to ~0.63 dex - a significant improvement over previous results, but still too large to serve as competitive standard candles, when compared to SNIa (uncertainties on distances of ~5-10%) or the L(X)-L(UV) relation in quasars (uncertainties of 10-12%). We tested including the width of broad emission lines as additional parameters, but found that this does not significantly lower the observed dispersion, contrary to previous studies on smaller samples. Finally, we discuss how future X-ray missions such as AXIS and NewAthena will improve this scenario by enabling precise variability measurements for thousands of AGN up to redshift z~3, thereby enabling it as a new cosmological probe.",

In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using deep wide-area multi-band imaging (e.g., from the Rubin Observatory) to efficiently select high redshift ELGs. Using Hyper Supreme-Cam $grizy$ photometry and COSMOS2020 many-band photometric redshifts, we designed simple color cuts guided by a probabilistic random forest classifier to select galaxies at $z = 1.1$--$1.6$. We then empirically tested and refined these color cuts using two samples of galaxies with deep spectroscopy and broad color coverage obtained with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Compared to DESI ELGs at $z = 1.1$--$1.6$, we achieve a higher redshift measurement success rate (89% versus 69%), a much higher correct redshift range success rate (84% versus 34%), and a far higher net surface density yield (1372 $\\mathrm{deg^{-2}}$ versus 660 $\\mathrm{deg^{-2}}$). Combining our sample with current DESI ELGs would increase the net ELG number density by a factor of $\\sim3$, moving it out of the shot-noise limited regime and reducing the uncertainties on the BAO scale parameter at $z = 1.1$--$1.6$ by a factor of $\\sim 2$.",

To further quantify environmental influence, we adopt an information-theoretic approach and measure the normalised mutual information between dominant mass component and galaxy colour across the $d_{\\mathrm{f}}$-$d_{\\mathrm{n}}$ plane. The mass-colour coupling increases with distance from nodes at fixed filament proximity, indicating a weakening of this relation in cluster-scale environments and a stronger coupling within filamentary regions. This behaviour is strongly mass dependent, with low-mass galaxies exhibiting a more pronounced environmental modulation than high-mass systems. These results support a scale-dependent view of galaxy evolution across the cosmic web, highlighting the distinct and complementary influence of nodes and filaments.",

Sonkamble, Madhav Patil, Sachindra Naik, Ilani Loubser Accepted for publication in Astrophysics (Ap) Journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a multi-wavelength study of the nearby starburst galaxy M 82 by combining high-resolution Far-ultraviolet (FUV) imaging from the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat and archival Chandra X-ray observations. Using FUV flux measurements, we estimate a spatially-resolved star formation rate (SFR) across several star-forming clumps within a radius of $\\sim$3.6 kpc, finding a total SFR of 0.022 M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The H$_{\\alpha}$ recombination line flux yields an SFR of $\\sim$0.010 M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, while the infrared-based SFR derived from 24 $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ emission is significantly higher at 16 - 18 M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, suggesting that a substantial fraction of star formation in M 82 is heavily dust-obscured. Morphological comparison of FUV, H$_{\\alpha}$, mid-infrared, and soft X-ray emission reveals a strong spatial correlation, tracing multi-phase outflows along the galaxy's minor axis. X-ray spectral analysis using a three-temperature $\\texttt{VAPEC}$ model shows enhanced abundances of Ne, Mg, Si, and S, consistent with enrichment from Type-II supernovae. These results demonstrate the importance of combining UV, optical, IR, and X-ray observations to probe both obscured and unobscured star formation, the metal enrichment, and the outflow-driven evolution of starburst galaxies.",

The stellar mass follows a multi-Gaussian expansion light model with a free global mass-to-light ratio and an allowed radial $M/L$ gradient, while the dark matter is described by an elliptical generalised NFW halo. The double-source-plane geometry provides additional leverage against the mass-sheet transformation and helps constrain the radial mass profile. Despite allowing both a radial stellar $M/L$ gradient and a generalised NFW halo, the data prefer the canonical picture: an approximately constant stellar mass-to-light ratio with a Salpeter-like IMF normalisation, and a dark matter halo consistent with NFW. We infer $M_{\\star} = 4.4^{+0.25}_{-0.39}\\times 10^{11}\\,M_{\\odot}$ and an inner halo slope $\\gamma_{\\rm in}^{\\rm halo} = 1.04^{+0.10}_{-0.14}$.

The Fishbone-Moncrief torus is well established for this purpose in numerical astrophysics. The extent of the magnetic vector potential inside the torus that we coin the filling factor has not been studied before in the case of MAD simulations. We employ five 3D general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations initialized with large-scale tori, that are immersed in weak, poloidal magnetic fields. To study the impact of the spatial extent of the initial magnetic field, hence the magnetic energy content in the torus, we scale it with the filling factor w.r.t. the poloidal geometric area of the mass density distribution. A common choice of the filling factor is complimented and investigated in terms of altered energetics and angular momentum transport. Further, we investigate the polarized, radiative imprints of synchrotron emission on M87 at 86 GHz, comparing them with VLBI observations. Our simulations show that elevated filling factors significantly increase the electromagnetic energy contributions and outward angular momentum transport in the jet, due to the initially increased magnetic energy-content in the torus. High magnetic fillings exhibit increased linear polarization fractions, agreeing with the observed 15$\\%$ in M87*. We find the jet morphology more prone to disk-vertical flux tubes generated by MAD events. We show, that GRMHD simulations bracket the jet width measurements at the jet base in M87*. Increased magnetic filling of the torus produces jets that are noticeably brighter downstream compared to our reference models, hence, we find high fillings well suited for extended GRMHD jet models of other low-luminosity AGN, as well.",

Handley, Thomas Gessey-Jones Updated to be in line with the journal Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) When fits of the same physical model to two different datasets disagree, we call this tension. Several apparent tensions in cosmology have occupied researchers in recent years, and a number of different metrics have been proposed to quantify tension. Many of these metrics suffer from limiting assumptions, and correctly calibrating these is essential if we want to successfully determine whether discrepancies are significant. A commonly used metric of tension is the evidence ratio R. The statistic has been widely adopted by the community as a Bayesian way of quantifying tensions, however, it has a non-trivial dependence on the prior that is not always accounted for properly. We show that this can be calibrated out effectively with Neural Ratio Estimation. We demonstrate our proposed calibration technique with an analytic example, a toy example inspired by 21-cm cosmology, and with observations of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find no significant tension between DESI and SDSS.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The origin of cool-core (CC) and non-cool-core (NCC) dichotomy of galaxy clusters remains uncertain. Previous simulations have found that cluster mergers are effective in destroying CCs but fail to prevent overcooling in cluster cores when radiative cooling is included. Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is a promising mechanism for balancing cooling in CCs; however, the role of AGN feedback in CC/NCC transitions remains elusive. In this work, we perform three-dimensional binary cluster merger simulations incorporating AGN feedback and radiative cooling, aiming to investigate the heating effects from mergers and AGN feedback on CC destruction. We vary the mass ratio and impact parameter to examine the entropy evolution of different merger scenarios. We find that AGN feedback is essential in regulating the merging clusters, and that CC destruction depends on the merger parameters. Our results suggest three scenarios regarding CC/NCC transitions: (1) CCs are preserved in minor mergers or mergers that do not trigger sufficient heating, in which cases AGN feedback is crucial for preventing the cooling catastrophe; (2) CCs are transformed into NCCs by major mergers during the first core passage, and AGN feedback is subdominant; (3) in major mergers with a large impact parameter, mergers and AGN feedback operate in concert to destroy the CCs.",

Wollack 30 pages, 10 figures, published in JCAP in October 2025 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The Simons Observatory (SO) Small Aperture Telescopes (SATs) will observe the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization at six frequency bands. Within these bands, the angular response of the telescope (beam) is convolved with the instrument's spectral response (commonly called bandpass) and the signal from the sky, which leads to the band-averaged telescope beam response, which is sampled and digitized. The spectral properties of the band-averaged beam depend on the natural variation of the beam within the band, referred to as beam chromaticity. In this paper, we quantify the impact of the interplay of beam chromaticity and intrinsic frequency scaling from the various components that dominate the polarized sky emission on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, and foreground parameters. We do so by employing a parametric power-spectrum-based foreground component separation algorithm, namely BBPower, to which we provide beam-convolved time domain simulations performed with the beamconv software while assuming an idealized version of the SO SAT optics. We find a small, $0.02\\sigma$, bias on $r$, due to beam chromaticity, which seems to mostly impact the dust spatial parameters, causing a maximum $0.77 \\sigma$ bias on the dust $B$-mode spectra amplitude, $A_{d}$, when employing Gaussian foreground simulations. However, we find all parameter biases to be smaller than $1\\sigma$ at all times, independently of the foreground model. This includes the case where we introduce additional uncertainty on the bandpass shape, which accounts for approximately half of the total allowed gain uncertainty, as estimated in previous work for the SO SATs.",

Ad hoc rules of thumb are often used to justify the emulator accuracy required for reliable posterior recovery. We provide a theoretically motivated limit on the maximum amount of incorrect information inferred by using an emulator with a given accuracy. Under assumptions of linearity in the model, uncorrelated noise in the data and a Gaussian likelihood function, we demonstrate that the difference between the true underlying posterior and the recovered posterior can be quantified via a Kullback-Leibler divergence. We demonstrate how this limit can be used in the field of 21-cm cosmology by comparing the posteriors recovered when fitting mock data sets generated with the 1D radiative transfer code ARES directly with the simulation code and separately with an emulator. This paper is partly in response to and builds upon recent discussions in the literature which call into question the use of emulators in Bayesian inference pipelines. Upon repeating some aspects of these analyses, we find these concerns quantitatively unjustified, with accurate posterior recovery possible even when the mean RMSE error for the emulator is approximately 20% of the magnitude of the noise in the data.

Lett. 136, 081002 (2026) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Recent baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) are mildly discrepant ($2.2\\sigma$) with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) when interpreted within $\\Lambda$CDM. When analyzing these data with extended cosmologies this inconsistency manifests as a $\\simeq3\\sigma$ preference for sub-minimal neutrino mass or evolving dark energy. It is known that the preference for sub-minimal neutrino mass from the suppression of structure growth could be alleviated by increasing the optical depth to reionization $\\tau$. We show that, because the CMB-inferred $\\tau$ is negatively correlated with the matter fraction, a larger optical depth resolves a similar preference from geometric constraints. Optical depths large enough to resolve the neutrino mass tension ($\\tau\\sim0.09)$ reduce the preference for evolving dark energy from $\\simeq3\\sigma$ to $\\simeq1.5\\sigma$ and increase the CMB-inferred values of $n_s$ and $H_0$ to $0.968\\pm0.004$ and $67.94\\pm0.44$ km/s/Mpc, respectively. Conversely, within $\\Lambda$CDM the combination of DESI BAO, high-$\\ell$ CMB and CMB lensing yields $\\tau = 0.090 \\pm 0.012$, which is in $\\simeq3-5\\sigma$ tension with Planck low-$\\ell$ polarization data when taken at face value. Essentially all current CMB analyses $-$ including recent results from WMAP+ACT and SPT $-$ adopt the Planck measurement of $\\tau$: thus a systematic in large-scale Planck polarization would serve as a \"single-point failure\" for most modern cosmological analyses that include CMB data. While there is no evidence for systematics in the large-scale Planck data, $\\tau$ remains the least well-constrained $\\Lambda$CDM parameter and is far from its cosmic variance limit. This strengthens the case for future large-scale CMB experiments as well as direct probes of the epoch of reionization.",

With recent advances in both theory and observation, including efficient and flexible BBN codes, percent-level measurements of primordial deuterium and helium-4 abundances, refined measurements of nuclear reaction rates, and precise determinations of the baryon density from the cosmic microwave background, particularly keen insights can be gained from BBN. In this work, we leverage these developments to place model-independent constraints on deviations from the Standard Model expansion history during BBN. Using the latest abundance data, we apply principal component analysis to identify the most constrained and physically meaningful modes of expansion history variation. This approach allows us to impose the most general constraints on early dark energy during the epoch of BBN. We further examine whether general modifications to the expansion rate could alleviate the long-standing lithium problem. Our results demonstrate that BBN, sharpened by modern data and statistical techniques, remains an indispensable probe of dark energy and new physics in the early universe.",

Submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) One of the more surprising astrophysical discoveries of the last decade has been the presence of enormous quantities of dust at megaparsec distances from galaxies, which has important implications for galaxy evolution, the circumgalactic and intergalactic medium, and observational cosmology. In this work, we present a novel method for studying these vast halos of circumgalactic dust: a maximum-likelihood estimator for dust-induced extinction of background galaxies. This estimator can accommodate a broad range of archival photometric data and can incorporate different dust reddening prescriptions, making it applicable to diverse galaxy types and redshifts. We apply the estimator to the redMaGiC catalog of luminous red galaxies, selected for their tight dispersion in color and well-constrained photometric redshifts, and measure the resulting extinction as a function of projected distance from WISExSuperCOSMOS and redMaGiC foreground galaxies. We detect significant dust-induced extinction profiles extending to at least 1 megaparsec from galactic disks, with noticeable differences between star-forming and quiescent galaxies: star-forming galaxies exhibit a pronounced rise in extinction within the inner 50 kiloparsecs and a steep decline beyond 1 megaparsec, while the quiescent galaxies host little dust in the inner halo but have detectable extinction out to 30 megaparsecs. We test the robustness of our results using star catalogs and inverted foreground and background samples and find no evidence for significant systematic error. Our approach provides a powerful tool for studying the interplay between circumgalactic dust, galaxy evolution, and large-scale structure, with potential applications in a number of astrophysical subfields.",

Pumo 18 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics - Main Journal (Accepted 2026 February 7; received 2026 January 21; in original form 2025 October 27) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Supernova (SN) 1987A, with its long-rising ($\\gtrsim$40 days) light curve, defines a rare subclass of type II SNe known as 1987A-like events. Representing only 1-3 percent of all core-collapse SNe and often found in low-metallicity environments, their large diversity suggests a wide range of progenitor and explosion properties. This study aims to improve the understanding of 1987A-like SNe by characterizing their explosion parameters, including kinetic energy, ejected mass, progenitor radius at explosion, and synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass. Additionally, it seeks to identify systematic trends in both the physical properties and the observed features of these peculiar events. A new Bayesian parameter estimation method, based on our $^{56}$Ni-dependent analytical model for hydrogen-rich SNe, is applied to derive explosion parameters from the light curves and expansion velocities of one of the largest and most comprehensive 1987A-like SN samples to date. These data are measured through a consistent analysis of observations available in the literature. The analysis reveals a heterogeneous population that nevertheless clusters into two main groups: (i) lower-energy explosions with modest $^{56}$Ni yields ($\\sim$0.07 M$_\\odot$), similar to SN 1987A, and (ii) more energetic events (up to $\\sim$5 foe) with larger nickel production and, in some cases, unusually extended progenitors. We confirm a robust correlation between $^{56}$Ni mass, peak luminosity, and explosion energy, as well as between ejecta mass and recombination timescale. An anti-correlation between Ba II line strength and photospheric velocity indicates that stronger Ba II absorptions in 1987A-like SNe arise from more compact, slowly expanding ejecta. Our study underscores the need to extend analytical frameworks to include additional power sources, enabling scalable and accurate modeling of the growing number of peculiar transients.",

Our high-resolution image discovers new small-scale features in the nebula, including an elliptical core of $40''\\times20''$ surrounding the central pulsar and a $2'$-long arc wrapping around the core in the north. The latter shows a clear gap from the core, and it consists of a bright lobe in the northwest and a tongue-like structure in the northeast. These could be resulting from the pulsar wind interaction with the environment. Our polarization measurement reveals a highly ordered magnetic field with toroidal geometry. The small scale features are all highly linearly polarized. In particular, the lobe has a polarization fraction of $\\sim$60%, close to the synchrotron limit. This is also much higher than the value measured at a lower frequency, implying significant depolarization. We show that this can be explained by Faraday rotation in the nebula, and we constructed a simple 3D model accordingly to infer a magnetic field strength of $\\sim$50-105$\\mu$G.",

      "abstract": "The origin of isolated millisecond pulsars in globular clusters Raniere de Menezes High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) A significant fraction of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in globular clusters (GCs) are observed as isolated objects, despite the widely accepted scenario in which MSPs are formed through recycling in compact binary systems. The origin of these isolated objects therefore remains an open problem. In this Letter, we propose a physically motivated encounter rate per binary, $\\Lambda \\propto n a/(\\sigma a_H)$, incorporating the local stellar density $n$, velocity dispersion $\\sigma$, binary separation $a$, and the Heggie--Hills ionization radius $a_H$. Combined with companion ablation by the MSP, this rate successfully predicts the observed fraction of isolated MSPs in GCs, that is $\\mathcal{F}_i \\propto\\Lambda \\propto a_H^{-1}$, establishing dynamical ionization as the primary channel for producing isolated MSPs. We quantitatively test this model against a null hypothesis in which $\\mathcal{F}_i$ is independent of $a_H$, and find that the ionization-driven model is 220 times more likely than the null hypothesis. Our framework naturally explains the observed overabundance of isolated MSPs in $\\omega$ Centauri and establishes binary ionization as the primary mechanism responsible for the production of isolated MSPs in GCs.",

The accepted version has more contents and is available at Review of Modern Plasma Physics' website; see this https URL Rev. Mod. Plasma Phys. 10, 4 (2026) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) Many astrophysical fluids are magnetized and turbulent. Such fluids can be often described by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In this review, we mainly consider MHD turbulence with a strong mean magnetic field whose energy density is greater than or equal to the local kinetic energy density. In these fluids, the MHD waves, especially Alfvén waves, play a dominant dynamical role. Alfvén waves travel along magnetic field lines and collisions of opposite-traveling Alfvén wave packets are essential for turbulence cascade. We focus on strong turbulence regime, where nonlinear interaction during the collision is sufficiently strong and thus one collision is enough to complete turbulence cascade. We will cover the following types of turbulence. First, we review strong Alfvénic MHD turbulence. If the mean magnetic field is very strong, wave packets move very fast and duration of collision is too short to complete turbulence cascade. Even in this case we will show that strong turbulence regime emerges on a small scale. Second, we will consider small-scale MHD turbulence, where interaction of small-scale variants of Alfvén waves (i.e., whistler waves) is important. Third, we review scaling relations in strong relativistic force-free MHD turbulence, where interaction of relativistic Alfvén waves is important. Finally, we briefly discuss scaling relations in compressible MHD turbulence, where interaction of Alfvén waves is still important.",

Teng High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Free Fractionally Charged Particles (FCPs) are predicted by some theories beyond or extended to the standard model. FCPs have been widely searched for by underground and space-based experiments based on the assumption of heavy lepton-like particles. However, there is a paucity of research focusing on light-mass FCPs (LFCPs) in the sub-MeV mass range. In this work, we report the LFCPs in primary high energy cosmic rays, based on observational data from the Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) satellite. This study utilized ten years on-orbit data of DAMPE to search for LFCPs with a charge of $\\frac{2}{3}~e$. No LFCP candidate was observed. Upper flux limit of LFCPs with a mass of 0.511 MeV$/c^{2}$ and a charge of $\\frac{2}{3}~e$ is determined to be $\\rm 5.0 \\times 10^{-11}\\,cm^{-2}sr^{-1}s^{-1}$ at the $\\rm 90\\%$ confidence level.",

Although discovered in this context, there is no evidence that the transient is associated with any known gravitational wave event. Nonetheless, this source exhibits a 20-fold increase in flux density over $<250$ days, and it remains in a declining, detectable state more than 1000 days after the initial detection. Follow-up observations from 0.3 to 9 GHz reveal an evolving spectrum consistent with synchrotron emission. ASKAP J0055-2558 is spatially coincident with a low-mass, star-forming galaxy at redshift $z = 0.116$ ($d_{\\rm L}$= 543 Mpc), placing its peak radio luminosity at $\\nu L_\\nu \\sim 10^{39}\\,\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}$. Analysis of its radio light curve, inferred blastwave velocity, energetics, host galaxy properties and the absence of counterparts at other wavelengths suggest that ASKAP J0055-2558 is most consistent with either the late-time phase of an orphan long gamma-ray burst afterglow or a tidal disruption event involving an intermediate-mass black hole spatially offset from the galaxy nucleus. The radio discovery of either of these phenomena is extremely rare, with only a few or no confirmed examples to date.",

Their physical origins remain highly debated, with proposed explanations ranging from stellar explosion to tidal disruption event (TDE). Here we report observations of the most luminous FBOT, AT 2024wpp whose post-peak luminosity rebrightens in X ray and becomes flattening in optical in a manner follows the decay rate characteristic of TDEs ($L_{\\rm bol} \\propto t^{-5/3}$). This invokes energy contribution of accretion by a central compact object, getting further corroborations from hardening of X-ray spectral index and detection of outflow inferred from the emission lines at similar phase. Detailed modeling of luminsoity evolution favors a coalesce explosion of a 34 M$_{\\odot}$ Wolf-Rayet star with a 15 M$_{\\odot}$ black hole (BH), demonstrating that some FBOTs may be associated with TDE of a stellar blackhole.",

Padmanabh, Maria A. Papa, Adipol Phosrisom, Benjamin Steltner 19 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) provides advantages for radio pulsar searches by enabling efficient target selection. We can confidently point radio telescopes to the positions of Fermi unidentified gamma-ray sources that have a high probability of hosting a pulsar. As part of Transients and Pulsars with MeerKAT (TRAPUM), we conducted a survey of Fermi-LAT sources using the Ultra High Frequency (UHF; 544-1088 MHz) receiver of the MeerKAT radio telescope. We observed 79 sources that were identified as pulsar-like candidates using a random forest technique from the Fermi-LAT Fourth Source Catalogue. We observed each target for 10 minutes at two separate epochs. As a result, we discovered nine new millisecond pulsars (MSPs) and six slow pulsars. Based on the radio discoveries, we also searched for gamma-ray pulsations, confirming that seven of the newly discovered MSPs are associated with Fermi-LAT sources, and performed joint radio and gamma-ray pulsar timing. Companion mass estimates and evidence of radio eclipses indicate that among the nine MSPs there are three black widows and three redbacks. Lastly, we compared the discovered pulsars in the MeerKAT UHF survey against the previous Fermi sources TRAPUM survey at L band, concluding the superiority of UHF observations in sensitivity to fainter pulsars and in detection rate than L band for finding new gamma-ray MSPs.",

Accepted for publication in PRD High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Nearby pulsars within $\\sim1\\,{\\rm kpc}$ are considered to be possible sources of 10-500 GeV cosmic-ray positron excess measured by PAMELA and AMS-02. A TeV halo around Geminga is detected by HAWC, and the measurements of its surface brightness profile indicate a slow particle diffusion surrounding the source. This result challenges the pulsar interpretation of the positron excess. The observations at GeV energies provide direct information on the electron/positron density in the GeV nebula, which can offer more direct constraints on the origin of the positron excess. Two previous works have performed analyses on the GeV emission of the pulsar halo, but focused on the energy band above 8 GeV. In this work, we use a longer dataset from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) to re-analyze the GeV halo emission of Geminga, extending the analysis to cover the energy range of 1-1000 GeV. We find that the analysis in this wider energy range results in a low significance of the halo emission. This can be attributed to the Galactic interstellar emission model being unable to perfectly fit the background over this broader energy range, and due to the low measured halo flux at $<$ 10 GeV energies leading to a mismatch between the observation and model expectation. We also derive the spectral energy distribution of the tentative halo emission, which shows a very hard spectrum in the 1-10 GeV range.",

In the 6.5-6.9 keV band, XRISM reveals multiple Fe XXV and Fe XXVI emission components. One is a broad (with a width of sigma = 3000 km/s) and redshifted (+3400 km/s) component, originating at D = 0.02 pc from the central black hole. The other two components are narrow (with a width of sigma = 500 km/s) and exhibit redshifted and blueshifted velocities (+2600 km/s and -1500 km/s), originating from more distant regions (D = 0.1 pc). The photo-ionized model explains the broader component, while the two narrower components can be explained by either photo-ionization or collisional ionization. One interpretation is that the broader component is an outflow at ~10^2 R_S (R_S; Schwarzschild radius) and the narrow component is a shock-heated plasma close to the torus, with a possible connection to the JWST-discovered outflow outside the torus. Two blueshifted absorption lines are detected at ~7.1 keV (~10^4 km/s) and ~10.6 keV (~10^5 km/s). The line significance of the 10.6 keV line is above 98%. The absorption line components might be attributed to the broad emission component. These results demonstrate the high potential of XRISM/Resolve to characterize ionized emission and absorption features in the Fe-K band. Our findings establish a new benchmark in the study of circumnuclear environments in low-luminosity radio galaxies, thereby contributing to a broader understanding of AGN unification.",

We find that the dynamics of this fluid changes dramatically in the presence of a magnetic field. The shear stress tensor no longer adheres to a single differential equation; instead, it splits into three non-degenerate components, each evolving according to distinct dynamical equations. Exploring these equations in a Bjorken flow scenario, we find that for large magnetic fields, our theory predicts oscillatory behavior beyond the scope of an Israel-Stewart-like theory.",

Based on this, there are attempts to explain the diffuse neutrinos observed by IceCube with the accumulated contribution from a population of AGNs, but it is found that the maximum neutrino energy is less than tens of TeV and, as a result, additional source classes are needed to explain the high-energy component above this energy. Recently, motivated by the detection of >100 TeV neutrinos from the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469, it was shown that the turbulence acceleration in the corona can explain >100 TeV neutrinos given a larger magnetization parameter ($\\sigma\\sim 1$) in the corona, which leads to a larger maximum proton energy and a hard proton spectrum. In this paper, we extend this assumption to the population of AGNs and study whether the population of AGNs with a wide range of magnetization can explain the entire diffuse neutrinos. We find that AGN coronae could account for the diffuse neutrinos up to PeV energies if a significant fraction of AGNs have magnetization as large as $\\sigma\\sim 1-10$. This conclusion is insensitive to the shape of the magnetization parameter distribution as long as the range of the magnetization parameter is sufficiently wide and the distribution is flat towards high magnetization. Interestingly, this model can also explain the peak of the diffuse neutrino spectrum at 30 TeV.",

The sample consists of 11 confirmed black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs), 10 black hole candidates (BHC), and 21 neutron star X-ray binaries (NSXBs). Outbursts and flaring activities studied over 13 years show that 19/21 NSXBs spend significantly longer time in the hard state (observations for which hardness ratio is $\\geq$ 0.2) while 15/21 BHXB+XRC spend substantially longer time in the soft state (observations for which hardness ratio is $<$ 0.2). The frequency distribution of the hardness ratio clearly shows two distinct distributions for BHXBs and NSXBs, with their peaks separated: NSXBs prefer harder values, while BHXBs prefer softer values of hardness. Our model-independent analysis for 42 transient sources shows that statistically NSXBs do not prefer to show a canonical high soft state as observed in BHXBs. Additionally, the probability distribution of the duration of the 2-20 keV X-ray outburst is observed to peak at a significantly longer duration ($>$100 days) for BHXBs than for NSXBs (15-60 days). Our analysis shows that among candidate sources, Swift J1728.9-3613, MAXI J1535-571, MAXI J1659-152, EXO 1846-031 show a `q' diagram in the HID and prefer to align with the HID frequency distribution of BHXBs that show `q' diagram, MAXI J1305-704 and MAXI J1836-194 align with frequency distribution of black hole sources without `q' diagram while MAXI J1848-015 shows the HID distribution similar to NSXBs, indicating a neutron star accretor. Therefore, a long-term statistical study of MAXI and Swift/BAT X-ray outbursts from a large sample of transient sources may be used to distinguish BHXB from NSXB.",

The keyhole has a morphology similar to that of many jet-shaped pairs of bubbles in cooling-flow clusters of galaxies and planetary nebulae. Therefore, the findings of this study, which make the bipolar structure of SN 1987A robust, strengthen the claim that a pair of energetic jets shaped the keyhole and its surroundings. According to the jittering-jets explosion mechanism (JJEM), this pair of jets was the most energetic of several pairs that exploded SN 1987A. This study adds to the accumulating evidence that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe, responsible for the majority, or even all, CCSNe.",

They also serve as important observational tracers through $\\gamma$-ray emission, radio synchrotron, and secondary particle production. Since CR particles follow power-law distributions in momentum space spanning many decades in energy, and because diffusion and radiative losses further shape these spectra, it is crucial to model spectrally resolved CRs in numerical simulations and to assess the impact of this modeling on gas dynamics and observational signatures. We present a consistent multi-group spectral method in momentum space for CR protons called RAMSES-MCR in the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES, based on the two-moment formalism that evolves both CR energy and number density in momentum space, together with their associated flux. The modeled CR processes include advection, anisotropic/isotropic diffusion, streaming instability, Coulomb and hadronic losses, adiabatic changes, and feedback onto the gas. We also show that the method can be naturally extended to CR electrons (e.g. including synchrotron losses) and generalized to multiple CR species. The implementation is validated against a suite of standard multi-dimensional tests. We finally apply RAMSES-MCR to the three-dimensional expansion of a supernova remnant including CRs with anisotropic diffusion and energy losses, and demonstrate how CR energy redistributes in a momentum-dependent manner and modifies the gas momentum during the snowplough phase.",

Here we put forward a new physical model to explain how a large number of small dusty gas clumps form and they collectively appear as a geometrically thick dynamic dusty torus. The circumnuclear hot gas flows towards the central black hole (BH) and forms a rotating disk on sub-pc scales. A fraction of inflowing hot gas condenses to form small cold clumps due to thermal instabilities, when the accretion rate is sufficiently high. These cold dusty gas clumps are irradiated by the central accretion disk and re-radiate as dust emission mostly in the infrared. We propose that the dusty torus in AGN consists of such cold clumps vertically supported by the radiation force against gravity. For clumps with suitable column density, the vertical component of the BH gravity is in quasi-static equilibrium with the infrared radiation force together with the vertical component of the disk radiation force. Our model is robust in the sense that for any reasonable range of parameters concerning clump vertical dynamical equilibrium a torus exists. We further show that the hot gas in the rotating flow condenses to cold clumps only if its accretion rate is higher than about one percent of the Eddington rate. The radiation force is unable to lift the cold gas clumps up away from the mid-plane when the luminosity of the disk surrounding the BH is lower than 0.1 percent of the Eddington luminosity. These two features of our model may provide a physical explanation for the lack of evidence of dusty tori in low-luminosity AGNs.",

Their long-term optical and infrared variability reflects the evolution of the circumstellar disk around the luminous companion. This variability manifests photometrically as an excess of flux that increases with wavelength and spectroscopically as line emission. The disk is also expected to generate linear polarization. We present a systematic study of the optical long-term polarimetric variability of Be/X-ray binaries on data collected over 10 years. Our aim is to characterize the polarimetric properties of these systems and to probe the structure of their circumstellar disks. We have been monitoring Be/X-ray binaries visible from the Northern hemisphere with the RoboPol polarimeter. Optical polarimetric variability is a common trait in Be/X-ray binaries. The variability can be attributed to the Be star's circumstellar disk. Our polarization analysis confirms previous claims based on spectroscopic data that the circumstellar disks in BeXBs are, on average, smaller and denser than those in Be stars in non-binary systems. Our data also confirms the presence of highly distorted disks before giant X-ray outbursts, although this result is still affected by the lack of simultaneous and well-sampled observations during major X-ray outbursts.",

SN 2024abvb displays an extended rise time in the $g$- and $o$-bands (10.1 and 10.6 days respectively), followed by a linear decline in all photometric bands. Comparisons with other supernova subclasses show that the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of SN 2024abvb are distinct from Type~Ibn and Type Icn events, with a higher peak $r$-band luminosity and lower blackbody temperatures. Spectra reveal an initial blue continuum and narrow P-Cygni profiles, with C {\\sc ii} $\\lambda$5890 dominating in emission, persisting at late phases, and showing a rapid decline in the expansion velocity. Weak He {\\sc i} $\\lambda$5876 features are tentatively detected at early times. Analysis of progenitor scenarios rules out thermonuclear origins based on incompatible light curve shapes and spectral signatures. A rare massive star progenitor appears unlikely given the low local star formation rate. The most plausible origin is an ultra-stripped supernova scenario involving a binary system; this best explains the observed separation from the host, the low circumstellar material mass, the fast photometric evolution and the low nickel production, although a discrepancy in model versus observed ejecta mass remains. These results reinforce the classification of SN 2024abvb as a distinctive Type Ibn/Icn event and highlight the diversity of progenitor channels for interacting supernovae.",

Vergara Accepted for publication 23/02/2026 (A&A) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The existence of massive, compact galaxies (Little Red Dots, LRDs) at $z \\sim 2$ challenges early structure formation models, suggesting rapid stellar and black hole (BH) assembly. While LRDs are efficient environments for BH growth, many show no X-ray evidence of strong AGN emission. We utilize a subsample of X-ray non-detected LRDs to test the compatibility of collision-based BH formation scenarios and constrain physical parameters like metallicity and column this http URL results indicate LRDs are ideal birthplaces for massive BHs, particularly given a mass-radius relation $R_{gal} \\propto M_{gal}^{0.6}$. Collision-based models suggest seed masses larger than those in the local Universe, consistent with high-redshift BH mass-radius relations. We modeled BH seed formation and X-ray emission (0.3-7 keV) against observed upper limits. We find that mass-radius exponents $> 0.55$ favor the collision-based scenario; however, consistency with stacked X-ray analysis requires specific accretion and obscuration parameters. Constant or increasing SFR scenarios with high Eddington ratios are feasible but necessitate larger column densities or higher metal enrichment. Alternatively, moderate sub-Eddington accretion reconciles massive seeds with observed masses and X-ray weakness. We conclude that even if LRDs began as starbursts, they should eventually evolve into AGNs.",

II Ming-Xuan Lu, Yun-Feng Liang, Xuerui Ouyang, Rong-Lan Li, Xiang-Gao Wang Updated to match the published version High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Given that gamma rays with energies larger than TeV are severely absorbed by background radiation fields, for many extragalactic sources, the GeV-TeV gamma-ray observations are the messengers that are closest in energy to the TeV-PeV neutrinos observed by IceCube. Investigating whether there is a correlation between the gamma-ray and neutrino observations can help us identify high-energy neutrino sources and determine which sources are the main contributors to the all-sky diffuse neutrino flux of IceCube. In previous work, we have already studied the possible gamma-neutrino correlations by analyzing 10 years of IceCube public muon-track data. In this work, we further investigate such correlations by employing the IceCube p-value sky map of the scan for point sources. We examine the spatial associations of hotspots in the neutrino sky map with various gamma-ray source samples: the third Fermi-LAT catalog of high-energy sources (3FHL), LAT 14-year source catalog (4FGL), the fourth catalog of active galactic nuclei (4LAC) and subsets of these samples. Among all the samples, the 3FHL sample shows a possible correlation with the neutrino hotspots with a pre-trial p-value of $9.0\\times10^{-5}$ ($\\sim 3.9\\,\\sigma$), corresponding to a post-trial significance of $\\sim1.7\\,\\sigma$. However, this is found to be caused by three already known neutrino sources/source candidates: NGC 1068, TXS 0506+056, and PKS 1424+240.",

We propose that a subset of these BLAGNs, the so-called \"Little Blue Dots'' (LBDs) are accreting at super-Eddington rates and use geometrically thick, non-advective disk models to investigate photon scattering and shadowing within the polar funnel. Our models predict extremely-blue optical-UV continuum slopes and highly collimated radiation fields where isotropic-equivalent luminosities exceed the Eddington limit in the polar direction while shadowing suppresses emission at higher inclinations. This \"searchlight\" configuration naturally generates a stratified ionization structure: coronal and high-excitation narrow lines are produced along the symmetry axis, while the equatorial broad-line region (BLR) remains shielded from the hardest ionizing photons. We show that the anisotropic illumination of the BLR explains the observed faintness of high-ionization lines despite strong Balmer emission. For M_BH=10^7.5--10^8 Msun accretors at Eddington ratio ~10, standard BLR conditions predict HeII lambda 4686/Hbeta in the range 0.08--0.28. Notably, because inherently blue disk spectra provide a much higher ratio of ionizing to optical photons than standard quasar composites, the observed large Balmer equivalent widths are matched with typical BLR covering factors without invoking enshrouded geometries. Taken together, these findings support the view that super-Eddington accretion flows, shaped by thick disk geometries, may naturally account for the ionizing SED and emission line diagnostics of high-z LBDs, while offering a plausible pathway to rapid black hole growth at cosmic dawn.",

A key challenge in refining star-formation models is the lack of precise mapping of these dense molecular hydrogen clouds, where traditional tracers often yield inconsistent results. We demonstrate how, in the near future, neutrinos will emerge as a robust mass tracer due to worldwide advancements in neutrino telescopes. Neutrinos are produced alongside gamma-rays when cosmic-rays interact with molecular clouds. The neutrino production rate is proportional to the gas density without dependence on the complex properties of a cloud. Neutrinos also have the advantage of negligible absorption and unambiguous production channels, making it a method with the lowest systematic uncertainties. In an optimistic case where most gamma-ray emission from the Galactic Centre region originates from pion decays, we expect several tens of muon neutrinos to be detected in about two decades. Neutrinos from the CMZ will provide indications on the biases of traditional mass tracers and thus indirectly enhance the accuracy of gas measurements in far galaxies from which a neutrino signal is not detectable.",

These simulations, performed for shock Lorentz factors $\\Gamma_u = 2$, $3.5$, $6$, $10$, and $15$, are applicable to RRMS breakouts in shallowly declining density profiles such as stellar winds. We find that vigorous pair production acts as a thermostat, regulating the downstream temperature to $\\sim 100$-$200~{\\rm keV}$, largely independent of $f_{\\rm esc}$. A subshock forms and strengthens with increasing $f_{\\rm esc}$. The escaping spectra peak at $E_p \\approx 300$-$600~{\\rm keV}$ in the shock frame and deviate from a Wien distribution, exhibiting low-energy flattening ($f_\\nu \\propto \\nu^{0}$) due to free-free emission and high-energy extensions caused by inverse Compton scattering from subshock-heated pairs. While an earlier analytical model reproduces the velocity structure well at $\\Gamma_u = 2$, it significantly overestimates the shock width at higher Lorentz factors, particularly for $f_{\\rm esc} \\gtrsim$ a few $\\%$. Based on this finding, we provide updated predictions for breakout observables in wind environments for $\\Gamma_u \\gtrsim 6$. Notably, the duration of the relativistic breakout becomes largely insensitive to the explosion energy and ejecta mass, typically exceeding analytical predictions by orders of magnitude and capable of producing a $\\sim$300 s flash of MeV photons with a radiated energy of $\\sim 10^{50}$ erg for an energetic explosion yielding $\\Gamma_{bo} \\sim 6$.

Explicit likelihood methods often rely on simplified models, which may bias results and understate uncertainties. We introduce a simulation-based inference pipeline that couples a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) to a normalizing-flow posterior within the Learning the Universe Implicit Likelihood Inference framework. Each event is seeded by an analytic plane-wavefront fit; the GNN refines this estimate by learning spatiotemporal correlations among antenna signals, and its frozen embedding conditions an eight-block autoregressive flow that returns the full Bayesian posterior. Trained on about $8,000$ realistic UHECR air-shower simulations generated with the ZHAireS code, the posteriors are temperature-calibrated to meet empirical coverage targets. We demonstrate a sub-degree median angular resolution on test UHECR events, and find that the nominal 68% highest-posterior-density contours capture $71\\% \\pm 2\\%$ of true arrival directions, indicating a mildly conservative uncertainty calibration. This approach provides physically interpretable reconstructions, well-calibrated uncertainties, and rapid inference, making it ideally suited for upcoming experiments targeting highly inclined events, such as GRAND, AugerPrime Radio, and BEACON.",

In this study, we conduct high-resolution, two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics simulations with time-varying and anisotropic initial and boundary conditions to reproduce outflows launched from super-Eddington accretion flows and analyze their statistical properties. The resulting clumpy outflows extend across a wide range of radial distances and polar angles, exhibiting typical properties such as a size of ~10 rg (where rg is the gravitational radius), a velocity of ~0.05-0.2 c (where c is the speed of light), and about five clumps along the line of sight. Although the velocities are slightly smaller, these characteristics reasonably resemble those obtained from the XRISM observation. The gas density of the clumps is on the order of 10^{-13}-10^{-12} g cm^{-3}, and their optical depth for electron scattering is approximately 1-10. The clumpy winds accelerated by radiation force are considered to originate from the region within <~300 rg.",

The radiative transfer within the emitting region and the structure of the latter are calculated with the use of the self-consistent algorithm developed earlier. The magnetic scattering cross sections dependent on the photon energy and polarization have been incorporated. Second-order bulk Comptonization over entire emitting region, induced Compton scattering, the switching of the polarization modes, free-free processes, the cyclotron emission because of electron-proton collisions, and a realistic shape of the accretion channel have been taken into account. The case of a dipole magnetic field is considered. It is shown that the induced Compton effect can play a notable role in establishing the electron temperature in the post-shock zone. Within the model shock wave, a higher electron temperature is achieved than in the post-shock zone by means of the bulk-heating mechanism. The photons gaining the energy in the shock wave and above it due to bulk motion effects and the thermal Doppler effect are responsible for the formation of high-energy regions in the emergent continuum of the polarization modes.",

These sources serve as ideal laboratories for studying particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms in relativistic jets. In this work, we systematically analyze the $\\sim$16-year Fermi-LAT observational data for 25 extreme high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs (EHBLs). The results indicate that the majority of these sources display stable or low flux levels in the GeV band, with only 6 sources showing significant variability at a confidence level exceeding 5$\\sigma$. The time-averaged spectra over the 16-year period for most EHBLs are well described by a hard power-law model, with photon indices predominantly clustered between 1.7 and 1.8. Using Fermi-LAT data in conjunction with multiwavelength observations compiled from the literature, we construct broadband SEDs for these EHBLs and fit them with a one-zone synchrotron + synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) model. We find that this simplified theoretical framework is sufficient for modeling the observed SEDs of most of these EHBLs, albeit requiring relatively higher electron energies compared to other $\\gamma$-ray emitting HBLs, and at times under-representing the UV emission. Based on the SED fitting results, we investigate the physical properties of the emission regions in these EHBLs and compare them with those of other $\\gamma$-ray emitting HBLs.

Davies, T. Shimizu, D. Hill Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a detailed, spatially resolved { Veilleux \\& Osterbrock (VO) diagram} analysis of ESO\\,137-G034, a Compton-thick Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), based on narrowband {\\it HST} imaging in [O~III], [S~II], H$\\alpha$, and H$\\beta$ emission lines. The narrowband optical emission exhibits a bi-conical morphology and traces the diffuse X-ray emission observed with \\textit{Chandra}. We dissect the Interstellar Medium (ISM) into Seyfert-, LINER-, and H~II-dominated regions with a resolution of $\\sim0.1^{\\prime\\prime}$ ($\\sim20$\\,pc at $z=0.009$). To { visualize} the fine spatial structure of the { ISM excitation}, we introduce a new parameter: the Seyfert/LINER Index (SLI), defined as the perpendicular distance of each point in the { VO} diagram from the Seyfert/LINER division line. { SLI mapping reveals fine spatial structures in the ISM excitation especially in the Seyfert ionization bi-cones where the statistical significance of our data is higher.} Most of the emission within the bi-cones is Seyfert-like, with SLI values consistent with regions of the { VO} diagram that can be modeled with AGN photoionization. In the North-West Seyfert cone three radial SLI peaks suggest episodic nuclear outbursts, with estimated timescales of a few $10^3$\\,yrs and $<100$\\,yrs duration. The South-East cone shows inhomogeneous excitation, with a higher SLI region in its inner part, coinciding with a wider region of enhanced soft X-ray emission at the radio lobe inner edge. This region is characterized by line ratios consistent with fast shocks ($>1000$\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$) induced excitation. The North-West cone is surrounded by a smooth LINER ``cocoon''. The LINER region in the SE cone appears more irregular, with inter-cone LINER points likely shaped by both local ISM structure and shocks. Our findings highlight the complex interplay of different AGN feedback mechanisms in the ISM.",

Accepted by Astronomy and Astrophysics Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) An extensive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up campaign of the Type IIb SN 2022ngb is presented in the article. Through detailed modeling of this dataset, we aim to constrain the key physical parameters of the explosion, infer the nature of the progenitor star and its environment, and probe the dynamical properties of the ejecta. We analyze photometric and spectroscopic data of SN 2022ngb. By constructing and modeling the bolometric light curve with semi-analytic models, we estimate the primary explosion parameters. The spectroscopic data are compared with those of well-studied SNe IIb and NLTE models to constrain the properties of the progenitor and the structure of the resulting ejecta. SN 2022ngb is a low-luminosity SN IIb with a peak bolometric luminosity of L_bol = 7.76 (+1.15/-1.00) x 10^41 erg/s and a V-band rising time of 24.32 +/- 0.50 days. Light curve modeling indicates an ejecta mass of ~2.9-3.2 M_sun, an explosion energy of ~1.4 x 10^51 erg, and a low synthesized 56Ni mass of ~0.045 M_sun. Nebular phase spectra exhibit asymmetric line profiles, pointing to a non-spherical explosion and an anisotropic distribution of radioactive material. Our analysis reveals a relatively compact stripped-envelope progenitor with a pre-SN mass of approximately 4.7 M_sun (corresponding to a 15-16 M_sun ZAMS star). Our analysis suggests that SN 2022ngb originated from the explosion of a moderate-mass relatively compact, stripped-envelope star in a binary system. The asymmetries inferred from the nebular phase spectral line features suggest a non-spherical explosion.",

We investigate how different binary interaction channels shape the physical and orbital properties of DWD systems, focusing on component masses, orbital separations, core compositions, and mass transfer rates. Using the binary population synthesis code COMPAS, we evolve $10^7$ binaries with physically motivated initial distributions of binary parameters. Our simulations reproduce the strong bimodality in the final orbital separations, including a pronounced deficit of systems around $100-500 \\rm\\,R_\\odot$, arising from distinct evolutionary pathways: wide DWDs predominantly originate from stable Roche lobe overflow (RLOF), while close DWDs form through unstable RLOF leading to at least one common envelope (CE) phase. Moreover, we show that the core compositions of WDs provide a powerful tracer of evolutionary history: He-core WDs are strongly concentrated in close systems, whereas CO-core WDs span the full separation range and exhibit a small mass gap in wide binaries. We further identify a correlation between the donor mass transfer rate and the final orbital separation, highlighting the impact of non-conservative mass transfer on the resulting orbital configuration of DWD systems. These results underscore the links among evolutionary channels, chemical composition, and mass transfer rates; thereby provide a unique framework for interpreting Gaia DWD samples and forecasting the joint electromagnetic and GW population accessible to LISA.",

Accepted for publication in ApJS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are characterized by strong temporal flux density variability across the electromagnetic spectrum, offering insights into the complex physical processes governing accretion and plasma outflows. To systematically investigate AGNs flux density variability in radio bands, a long-term program was initiated in late 2016: quasi-Simultaneous Multiwavelength Monitoring of gamma-ray-loud AGNs with the Nanshan 26-m radio telescope (SMMAN). This work presents the first data release of the SMMAN program, spanning over eight years from 2016 to 2024 with observations at 4.8 and 23.6 GHz. The SMMAN sample includes 131 northern ($\\delta >\\sim0^{\\circ}$) sources selected from the Fermi Large Area Telescope third source catalog. The characteristics of variability, spectral index, luminosity, and $\\gamma$-ray loudness factor are examined for different AGN classes within the sample. Target sources exhibit stronger variability at 23.6 GHz compared to 4.8 GHz, with BL Lac objects being more variable than flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). BL Lacs generally have flatter radio spectra, while FSRQs, blazar candidates of uncertain type (BCUs), and radio galaxies (RDGs) span a wider range from flat to steep. FSRQs are more radio-luminous than BL Lacs and other classes, with BCUs intermediate and RDGs generally fainter. FSRQs and BL Lacs have higher $\\gamma$-ray loudness factors than RDGs, while BCUs have intermediate values. The SMMAN dataset, incorporated with other historical and ongoing monitoring programs, will provide a unique opportunity to investigate the evolution of spectral energy distributions, search for quasi-periodic oscillations, and analyze supermassive black hole binary systems.",

Pipeline code is at this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The ALMA Central Molecular Zone Exploration Survey, ACES, has mapped $\\gtrsim1000$ square arcminutes at 3 mm toward the center of our Galaxy. ACES provides the first large-scale, high-resolution ($\\sim2.5$\") view of the central $\\sim200$ parsecs of the Milky Way. In this work, we describe the continuum data processing and present the continuum data products. In the combined mosaic of 45 individual ALMA mosaics, the typical RMS noise achieved is $\\sim0.1$ mJy per $\\sim2.5$\" beam, though there is a tail of substantially higher noise toward regions with bright continuum structure, especially around Sgr A* and Sgr B2. In-band spectral indices are measurable for a small fraction of the brightest and most compact sources, enabling distinction between dust-dominated and free-free- or synchrotron-dominated sources. To recover emission on large angular scales, we present the GBT MUSTANG-2 Three millimeter Extended Nucleus Survey (TENS), a new 10\"resolution survey of the CMZ, which we combine with the ACES image by feathering. To demonstrate the quality and reliability of the ACES data, we compare to previously-published ALMA data obtained with higher resolution and sensitivity, finding overall good agreement with past results, but some disagreement toward the brightest sources.",

Main text 15 pages, 6 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Gaseous halos around galaxies play an important role in galaxy evolution. The exchange of metals from the interstellar medium (ISM) to the circumgalactic medium (CGM) are caused by the formation, feedback, and/or merging history of galaxies. We study the variation in chemical composition between the ISM ($\\lesssim3\\,$kpc) and CGM ($\\sim5-10\\,$kpc) for a sample of $M_{\\star}>10^{9.5}\\,M_{\\odot}$ main-sequence galaxies at $4<z<6$ with both JWST and ALMA observations. Using JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy, we derive the optical line ratios from the ISM and the CGM for our sample focusing on the typical optical lines used for metallicity studies. Our comparison shows that the ISM and the CGM have similar chemical abundances. This indicates that the CGM of these typical $4<z<6$ galaxies is enriched to the level of their ISM in the early universe. Using statistical tests, we find that some of the line ratios show marginal differences between the ISM and CGM. Combined with \\texttt{Cloudy} modeling, our results suggest that a difference in ionization level (higher for the ISM) is the dominant reason for the observed ratio difference of oxygen line ratios. There is also indication of a deficit in the nitrogen abundance with respect to oxygen in the CGM, which suggests a delay in redistribution of secondary nitrogen. Finally, an enhanced $F_{[\\rm CII]\\rm 158\\mu m}/F_{\\rm H\\alpha}$ ratio is observed in the CGM, suggesting that feedback and/or mergers play a key role in metal mixing.",

The centre-of-mass motion of the pairs is taken into account. We derive formulas and timescales for the secular evolution of the orbital parameters for both wide and close binaries. We apply these results to environments typical of dark matter dominated ultra-faint dwarf galaxies and show that some binaries undergo significant eccentricity oscillations, while their semi-major axes decrease more gradually. We consider a simple binary star population and find that dynamical friction, notably, can enhance the bias from unresolved binaries in velocity dispersion measurements.

Comments welcome. Stacks available through this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We compile JWST/NIRSpec prism and MIRI data for 249 Little Red Dots (LRDs) at $2.3<z<9.3$, forming a representative spectroscopic subset of NIRCam-selected LRDs. We derive a median stacked spectrum covering rest-frame 0.09-1.2 $\\mu$m, with MIRI photometry extending the spectral energy distribution to 4 $\\mu$m. Four additional stacks for subsamples defined by optical-to-UV luminosity ratios show that LRDs form a heterogeneous population spanning diverse continuum slopes and line properties. Assuming LRDs host super-massive black holes (BHs) surrounded by dense gas clouds, and stars accompany this core, we infer masses of $M_{BH}\\sim10^{6.0-6.5}$~M$_\\odot$ and $M_\\bigstar\\sim10^{8.3}$ M$_\\odot$, corresponding to BH-to-stellar mass ratios of 1-2%. The stacks show ubiquitous UV and optical FeII emission, indicating a direct view of the broad-line region and high (but sub-Eddington) accretion ($\\lambda_{Edd}=0.6\\pm0.2$). We find a significant stellar contribution in the far-UV, reaching $\\sim80$% in the bluest systems. Possible Wolf-Rayet features (HeII$\\lambda$4687, nitrogen lines) are identified, tracing a young (3-7 Myr) compact starburst event. We also detect strong Balmer breaks and atypical Balmer, Paschen, [OIII], and optical and near-infrared HeI line ratios, and an absorption at $\\sim4550$ Angstrom (probably linked to FeII), all consistent with radiative-transfer effects in high-density gas with warm temperatures (4000-7000 K). We find a diversity of LRD flavors modulated by the luminosity ratio between between a short ($\\lesssim20$ Myr) and intense phase of BH activity, the most extreme stage lasting $\\sim3-7$ Myr, characterized by near-Eddington-limit radiation, and a nuclear and compact starburst dominated by massive stars (even super-massive, $\\mathrm{M}_\\mathrm{SMS}\\sim10^{5}$ M$_\\odot$), all embedded in dense gas with modest dust content producing a variety of optical depths.",

Rivilla, Álvaro Sánchez-Monge, Anika Schmiedeke, Yoshiaki Sofue, Volker Tolls Re-submitted to MNRAS after referee report Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way is the way station that primarily controls how much gas flows from the disk of the Galaxy towards the central nucleus. While this region is well documented to have extreme gas properties that clearly distinguish it from the rest of the Galaxy, the properties of the bulk molecular gas at high angular resolution are relatively unexplored. Band 3 data from the ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array) large program ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) reveal the highly filamentary nature of CMZ molecular gas at high resolution (3\" or 0.1pc) across the entire CMZ. Visual inspection of these data suggests that there are at least two general classes of elongated structures, which we identify as: i) large-scale (10 pc) filamentary structures (LFs) and ii) a ubiquitous population of small-scale (about 1 pc) filamentary structures (SFs). We present detailed morphological and kinematic properties towards three structures in each category, as well as their association with magnetic fields and the correlation of HNCO 4(0,4)-3(0,3) with other molecular species. Our investigation reveals that these structures are largely coherent in position-position-velocity space. The alignment with the magnetic field structure is mixed, with some parallel, some perpendicular, and some intermediate alignments. We find that LFs likely trace pieces of contiguous CMZ orbital structures and are a manifestation of global CMZ dynamics. The second class, SFs, are pervasive and may be the result of complicated turbulence and shearing dynamics in the CMZ gas flows, as seen in numerical simulations.",

      "abstract": "Willman 1 Revisited: The Kinematics, Chemistry, and Orbital Properties of a Potentially-Disrupting Dwarf Galaxy Camille Chiu, Marla Geha, William Cerny, Nitya Kallivayalil, Hannah Richstein, Christopher T. Garling, Beth Willman 21 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables. Accepted by ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The ultra-faint Milky Way satellite Willman 1 (W1; $M_V = -2.6$; $r_{\\rm half} \\sim27$ pc) was the first stellar over-density found via resolved stars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, yet its classification as either a dwarf galaxy or star cluster remains ambiguous. Using new Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy, HST/ACS photometry, and orbital modeling, we re-examine the nature of W1. From our updated sample of 57 member stars, we find that past analyses included four binaries and seven non-members, identified here using Gaia proper motions and updated velocities. We continue to find a velocity dispersion consistent with previous analyses, measuring $\\sigma_v = 4.7^{+1.5}_{-1.3}$ km s$^{-1}$ from 49 stars out to $3~r_{\\rm half}$. If W1 is in equilibrium, this suggests a dynamical mass of $5.9^{+3.7}_{-3.4} \\times 10^5~M_{\\odot}$ and a mass-to-light ratio of $(M/L)_V = 660 \\pm 590$. Based on Ca II triplet measurements, we estimate an iron abundance of [Fe/H] $= -2.45^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$ and a metallicity dispersion of $\\sigma_{\\rm [Fe/H]} = 0.30^{+0.15}_{-0.11}$ dex. We confirm that W1 does not exhibit mass segregation inside $\\sim1~r_{\\rm half}$. Our best-fit orbital model predicts that W1 is at apocenter, implying that W1 has been closer to the Milky Way in the recent past, reaching a pericentric distance $\\lesssim 25$ kpc from the Galactic center $\\sim0.3$ Gyr ago. Given its internal kinematics, metallicity spread, and lack of mass segregation, we conclude that W1 is a galaxy. However, given its orbit and structural properties, which suggest that W1 might be tidally disrupted, and the difficulty of identifying a pure member sample, we caution that the measured internal velocity dispersion may not accurately reflect the dynamical mass of this system.",

Pipeline code is at this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The ALMA Central molecular zone Exploration Survey (ACES) large program has observed the inner ~ 200 pc of the Milky Way at 3 mm (Band 3) using ALMA's 12m, 7m, and Total Power arrays. With an angular resolution of ~ 2\", ACES provides a contiguous, multi-scale view of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) via the dust continuum and a suite of molecular lines. We present an overview of the molecular line data processing for ACES and describe the first data release. We showcase the HNCO (4-3) and HCO$^{+}$ (1-0) data, which were targeted at high spectral resolution (0.2 km s$^{-1}$) to trace the kinematics of the molecular gas in the CMZ. The HNCO and HCO$^{+}$ maps are compared with previous single-dish CMZ surveys and discrete ALMA observations of CMZ clouds to demonstrate the quality of the data. We highlight the ubiquity of parsec-scale, linear absorption features traced by HCO$^{+}$. Their origin is unknown, and ACES provides the first opportunity to study these enigmatic features throughout the CMZ. We release the HNCO and HCO$^{+}$ cubes for all 45 ACES fields, along with the full cube mosaics which combine all fields into a contiguous mosaic of the CMZ. We additionally provide advanced products of these full mosaics, including integrated and peak intensity, noise, and position-velocity maps. These products provide substantial legacy value for the community, offering an unparalleled view of the physical and kinematic structure of the dense gas in the CMZ.",

Sholukhova 22 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables, accepted in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We aim to increase the limited number of quasars behind M31, necessary for probing the chemical content of the gas and for proper motion reference, with reliable and homogeneous redshift measurements from emission lines. We carried out spectroscopic follow up of 32 quasar candidates. We confirm 23 quasars: two are new discoveries (J004029.727+403705.68 and J004215.489+412031.52) and the rest were reported elsewhere, but with somewhat deficient analysis; 16 spectra are published for the first time. We report new homogeneous redshifts for 34 quasars (from 40 spectra, adding 17 from archives) and summarize all available information about bona-fide quasars with reliable redshift, bringing their number to 124 within the mu_B=26 mag/arcsec^2 isophote. We carried out a comparison of redshifts from different sources and excluded some objects with redshifts derived from low-resolution spectra. We derive the reddening for them from the color excess with respect to dereddened counterparts with similar redshifts in the field. Comparisons of our reddenings with M31 reddening maps found no significant correlations. Most QSOs behind M31 show low reddening and do not probe high-extinctions underlining the need to identify fainter quasars behind nearby galaxies, especially behind higher extinction regions -- probably due to a bias towards following up brighter and less extinct candidates. Finally, the redshifts derived from low-resolution spectra must be treated with caution, because they can contain significant errors.",

Pipeline code is at this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The mass flows and energy cycles within the inner regions of galaxies exert a powerful influence on the evolution of the galaxy population. The centre of the Milky Way is the only galactic nucleus for which it is possible to resolve the physical mechanisms that drive these cycles, namely star formation and feedback, while also tracing global (>100 pc) processes which determine where and when star formation and feedback occur. We present an overview of ACES, the 'Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) CMZ Exploration Survey', a ~1.5\" angular resolution, 0.2-3 km/s spectral resolution ALMA Band 3 (85-102 GHz), survey of the 'Central Molecular Zone' (CMZ) -- the inner-100 pc of the Galaxy (l = 359.4 deg to 0.8 deg). ACES spectral setup is tuned to observe optimal tracers of the physical, chemical, and kinematic conditions in over 70 spectral features (e.g. HCO+, HNCO, SiO, H40alpha, complex molecules) of the gas in the CMZ, to derive the properties of all potentially star-forming Galactic Centre gas, from global scales (100 pc) to dense ~0.05 pc structures that are expected to host individual star-forming cores, down to sub-sonic (<0.4 km/s) velocity resolution. In this overview paper, we provide the scientific justification for the ACES survey, explain the choice of observational setup, and describe the data legacy products. Finally, we show some of the initial ACES data which highlight the power of ACES' combination of high angular resolution, unprecedented spatial dynamic range, sensitivity, spectral resolution and spectral bandwidth as an illustration of how ACES aims to understand how global processes set the location, intensity, and timescales for star formation and feedback in the CMZ.",

Bonfini Accepted for publication in A&A, 14 pages, 11 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Reliable, versatile galaxy activity diagnostics are essential for understanding galaxy evolution. Traditional methods frequently necessitate extensive preprocessing, such as starlight subtraction and emission line deblending (e.g., H{\\alpha} and [N II]), which can introduce substantial biases and uncertainties due to their model-dependent nature. In this work we developed an automated, diagnostic tool capable of distinguishing between star-forming (SF), active galactic nuclei (AGN), low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs), composite, and passive galaxies. We developed a diagnostic tool based on a support vector machine trained on data from optical emission-line ratios and color selection criteria. From literature studies and exploring combinations of discriminatory feature schemes, we found that the equivalent widths of H{\\beta}, [O III]{\\lambda}5007, and H{\\alpha}+[N II]{\\lambda}6548,84 as key diagnostic features. Additionally, galaxies classified as AGN can be distinguished into broad- and narrow-line AGN by measuring the full quarter at the half-maximum of H{\\alpha} and [N II] complex. We have developed a diagnostic tool that encompasses all activities of galaxies while achieving high performance scores across all of them. Our diagnostic achieves overall accuracy of 83% and recall of 79% for SF, 94% for AGN, 85% for LINER, 77% for composite, and 96% for passive galaxies. Our diagnostic tool significantly improves upon existing diagnostics as it eliminates the need for preprocessing (i.e., starlight subtraction or flux calibration) and spectral line fitting, includes all activity classes under one scheme, and distinguishes the two main AGN types. In addition, omitting starlight subtraction does not significantly reduce performance. Furthermore, Its narrow wavelength requirement enables use across a wide redshift range, making it ideal for high-z studies.",

Lu 16 pages, 13 figures; submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) CO$_2$ is an important, stable, and abundant molecule in the Universe, but it is very difficult to detect because it has no observable pure rotational transitions. The unique sensitivity and resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provide a fresh way to investigate it. CO$_2$ is typically found in the solid phase (ice) on grain mantles in dense molecular clouds, but is less commonly detected in the gas phase (compared to common molecules such as CO and H$_2$O) and has mostly been found in protostellar and proto-planetary environments. Here, we report and characterize the first observations of gas-phase CO$_2$ absorption toward two IR-bright regions of the Galactic Center, thanks to the high sensitivity of JWST. Using an LTE model we find a CO$_2$ gas excitation temperature between 20 and 50~K, a column density around 2$\\times$10$^{15}$~cm$^{-2}$ and a radial velocity consistent with 0. We also report: 1) simultaneous detections of C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN absorption bands (near 13.7 and 14.0 $\\mu$m, respectively), with column densitiy ratios of 1:3 and 3:2 with respect to gas-phase CO$_2$, and 2) CO$_2$ ice absorption with a ice-to-gas ratio of 90, consistent with previous findings. We conclude that the absorbing medium is likely in the foreground, most likely from one or more somewhat clumpy cloud(s), located between 0.15 and 4~kpc away from Earth. Additionally, we detected point-like CO$_2$ emission likely associated with a Galactic Center star (IRS~11SW), which is also spatially coincident with a previously reported X-ray source, raising the possibility that the system is a symbiotic binary.",

These systems often comprise multiple structural components with distinct physical and dynamical properties, making it challenging to disentangle their individual contributions. Aiming at investigating the true structure of the inner stellar disk, we have developed a comprehensive pipeline for the chronochemical and dynamical analysis of galaxies (Glance: Galactic archaeoLogy via chronochemicAl & dyNamiCal modElling). The presented pipeline employs several state-of-the-art techniques by integrating them into a single, automated pipeline, enabling streamlined analysis of integral-field spectroscopy data, by allowing users to easily and directly extract valuable information on stellar populations, kinematics, dynamics, and gas properties. It automates multiple analysis techniques, including stellar population synthesis (Fado, Starlight, post-processing with RemoveYoung, kinematic extraction (pPXF, Bayes-LOSVD), and dynamical modelling (Dynamite). It handles tasks such as Galactic extinction correction, de-redshifting, Voronoi binning, and nebular continuum correction, while offering extensive customization options. Parallel processing significantly reduces computational time. When applied to MUSE data sampling the central region of NGC 1566, this methodology reveals that its stellar disk significantly deviates from the conventional exponential model, challenging the assumption of universality in disk morphology. In summary, this work presents a powerful, publicly available pipeline for conducting galactic archaeology, designed to advance our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies.",

Zylka 17 pages, 12 figures (26 pages, 29 figures including appendices). Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Large dust grains in thermal equilibrium dominate the far-infrared and contribute to the millimetre continuum of star-forming galaxies, but constraining their properties is difficult due to free-free and synchrotron contamination. We study spatial variations in the dust spectral index, mass, and grain properties in the nearby face-on spiral galaxy M 99. We use new 1.15 and 2 mm continuum observations from NIKA2 on the IRAM 30 m telescope (IMEGIN Guaranteed Time Large Programme) combined with multiwavelength data from UV to radio. The infrared-to-radio SED is decomposed into dust, free-free, and synchrotron components using the hierarchical Bayesian code HerBIE. Dust is modelled via a modified blackbody (MBB) with variable millimetre spectral index beta and the THEMIS dust model with fixed beta. We perform spatially-resolved analysis at scales ~1.75 kpc (~25''), covering the centre, spiral arms, and inter-arm regions. MBB fits reveal beta variations from ~1.6-1.7 in diffuse regions to ~2.3-2.5 in dense star-forming areas, likely due to grain coagulation and changes in silicate-to-carbonaceous ratios. Dust masses from variable beta are up to ~4x higher than fixed-beta models, which systematically bias dust-to-stellar and dust-to-gas ratios. The small grain fraction rises from ~10% in the centre to ~15% in the diffuse disc, anti-correlated with the interstellar radiation field; gas-phase metallicity plays a minor role within 8 kpc. Synchrotron spectral index ranges from ~0.6-0.7 in star-forming regions to ~1.2 in the diffuse medium, consistent with cosmic-ray electron ageing.",

Submitted to AAS journals Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate the relationship between star formation and X-ray emission from the hot interstellar medium (ISM) on $\\sim$kpc scales in NGC 4254 (M99) by combining spatially resolved star formation histories (SFHs) and Bayesian X-ray spectral fitting. We measure sub-galactic star formation rates (SFR) by modeling spectrophotometric UV-IR data with flexible SFHs, and we produce point-source-subtracted maps of the diffuse X-ray emission using Chandra data. We extract and fit the spectra of 5 regions selected by their SFR density $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$, deriving hot gas luminosities and plasma temperatures. We examine the sub-galactic $kT-\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$ and $L^{\\rm gas}_X-\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$ scaling relations in NGC 4254, and compare to predictions from simple models of the feedback into the ISM from core collapse supernovae (CCSNe). The hot gas emission from NGC 4254 is consistent with thermalization of $\\approx 40-50\\%$ of the energy from CCSNe in the ISM, and mass-loading of the CCSNe ejecta which decreases as $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}^{-1/3}$. Our optimized model implies a temperature and X-ray production efficiency that scale as $kT = (0.72^{+0.26}_{-0.18}~{\\rm keV}) \\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}^{0.34\\pm0.10}$ and $\\eta = (0.03^{+0.02}_{-0.01}) \\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}^{0.34\\pm0.18}$, respectively, for $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR} = 0.01-0.13~{\\rm M_{\\odot}~yr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}}$. We also compare the properties of the hot ISM to other ISM phases using data from the PHANGS program. The diffuse X-ray emission of a given region is on average 200 times fainter than the H$\\alpha$ emission, and we see evidence that the hot ISM is over-pressurized compared to the large-scale dynamical equilibrium pressure of the galaxy, consistent with expansion of the hot ISM into the ambient medium.",

Joseph W. Lazio Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) During the final stages of a galaxy merger, dynamical friction acting on the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the post-merger remnant can lead to the formation of a gravitationally bound binary SMBH. In the event that at least one of these SMBHs is actively accreting, the system can appear phenomenologically as an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with a broad line region (BLR) kinematically offset from the host galaxy rest frame. Such velocity offsets have been interpreted as signatures of binary SMBHs, recoiling SMBHs, or BLR gas dynamics within a single-SMBH system. We present deep Chandra X-ray observations of five nearby (0.1 < z < 0.2) Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars whose broad emission lines are Doppler-shifted relative to their host galaxies' systemic velocities, along with archival Chandra observations of 11 additional sources from the same sample. Using our Chandra data, we constrain SMBH masses with multiple independent techniques. We find systematic, method-dependent differences among black hole mass estimates, with masses inferred from the fundamental plane of black hole activity generally lower and single-epoch virial masses typically higher than those obtained using other methods. We also compare the X-ray photon indices and optical-to-X-ray spectral indices of our quasars to the broader quasar population. While we find no strong differences in optical-to-X-ray spectral indices, we do find systematically harder X-ray photon indices than typically observed in comparable quasars. These results constrain competing physical models but do not provide conclusive evidence for or against a binary SMBH origin of the velocity-offset BLRs.",

Pawlowski, Oliver Müller, Helmut Jerjen 13 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in the MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The existence and prevalence of planar, co-rotating distributions of satellite galaxies around L* host galaxies in the local universe remains a subject of ongoing debate. Despite numerous observational efforts over the past decade, a statistically robust sample of \"satellite planes\" across the diversity of host galaxy environments is lacking. To guide future observing strategies, we construct a controlled suite of mock observations of on-sky positions and line-of-sight (LOS) velocities of isolated L* host galaxies and their satellite systems, based on samples drawn from the Illustris TNG100-1 cosmological simulation to build a statistical sample. In these mock systems, satellite planes are defined by three key parameters: the number of satellites ($N_{\\mathrm{sat}}$), the fraction residing in a thin co-rotating plane ($f_{p}$), and the orientation angle relative to the observer ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{rot}}$). We evaluate the sensitivity of three observational metrics, $N_{\\mathrm{cor}}$ (number of co-rotating satellites), $b/a$ (projected flattening of the satellite distribution), and $v_\\mathrm{los}$ (mean absolute LOS velocity), to the presence of such planes. Our results show that detection rates are strongly dependent on $\\theta_{\\mathrm{rot}}$ and $N_{\\mathrm{sat}}$. Satellite planes that are viewed nearly edge-on or face-on, are the most readily detected. In contrast, intermediate orientations and systems with fewer satellites yield low detection success rates. Generally, only satellite planes with $N_{\\mathrm{sat}}>20$ have high chances of being detected. These findings provide a practical framework for prioritising observational targets and designing future surveys aimed at detecting and characterising satellite planes.",

Environmental trends and halo-to-halo scatter in the Pop III IMF Shingo Hirano, Yusuke Sakai, Hideyuki Umeda 19 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables, submitted to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The first generations of stars ionised and enriched their host galaxies and seeded the growth of massive black holes. Models often assume that Pop III stellar masses in different minihaloes are stochastic realisations of a single universal initial mass function (IMF). We use 138 cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamics simulations to test this assumption and to map the first-star IMF across redshift, halo mass, and baryon-dark matter streaming velocity (SV). We construct a dense-cloud merger tree and assign first-star masses by mapping the radial gas accretion-rate profile to stellar mass, yielding per-halo stellar mass functions without imposing any a priori IMF. The high-mass tail and multiplicity increase systematically with redshift, halo mass, and SV. Low-mass, low-SV haloes form only one or a few first stars, whereas massive, high-SV haloes host rich first star clusters and commonly produce very massive ($\\gtrsim10^3$-$10^4\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$) first stars. Even in a fixed environment, halo-to-halo scatter remains substantial. Nevertheless, group-averaged IMFs converge to well-defined forms, ruling out a single universal IMF at the halo level across the range of environments probed here. Mapping our seeds onto the redshift-mass plane, we show that high-SV and massive haloes preferentially populate the heavy-seed regime relevant to luminous high-redshift sources. At the same time, low-SV environments are consistent with single/few-event enrichment signatures in metal-poor stars. Our results deliver a practical, physically motivated prescription for per-halo IMF.",

Makarov Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph) The discovery of the galaxy ring known as the Council of Giants (CoG) highlights the need to explain such structures in the Local Universe. In the first paper of this series we presented HINORA - a code to locate (ring-like) structures in 3D point sets - and used it to identify the CoG in the most complete observations of the Local Volume. Here, in Part II, we apply the same method to cosmological simulations to quantify the possible existence of such objects in the LCDM model of structure formation. We analyze DM-only simulations with random and constrained initial conditions, selecting regions that reproduce the properties of the Local Group and Volume, respectively. In order to use the same selection criteria as previsouly done for observations, we relate K-band luminosities to halo masses through semi-empirical relations. After confirming that the selected regions from the simulations match the observed mass function and density of the Local Universe, we use HINORA to search for ring-like structures in them. We find that the existence of CoGs in LCDM simulations is a rather unusual phenomenon. The observed CoG represents an anomaly of more than 2.7 sigma from what is expected in the distribution of massive galaxies in LCDM. These results hint that the CoG could either be a rare chance configuration or the imprint of physical processes at intermediate scales that standard DM-only simulations fail to capture.",

We present magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of strongly magnetized (plasma-$\\beta$ << 1) HII region evolution that investigate and describe the formation of these ionized gas filaments. HII region evolution has been simulated in a 30 pc$^3$ box, in distinct models with pre-placed overdensities in the ambient medium and overdensities that have been generated with driven turbulence. We find that when these overdensities are seeded in the ambient medium before the birth of the ionizing source, the photoionized plasma stripped off of these dense blobs is funneled into long filaments along the magnetic field lines. The length and emission measure of these ionized gas filaments are similar to the filaments observed in the Central Molecular Zone. Given that these filaments are effectively magnetically-confined flows of photoionized gas, their density and curvature are influenced by the density of the blob and the geometry of the configuration.",

In this study, we investigated the surface reactions of solid CS$_2$ with hydrogen (H) atoms on amorphous solid water (ASW) using laboratory experiments supported by computational calculations. Our results show that CS$_2$ reacts with H atoms through quantum tunneling in the initial step, followed by successive H addition reactions, with or without activation barriers, on icy surfaces. These processes lead to the formation of several sulfur-bearing species, including hydrogen sulfide (H$_2$S), methyl mercaptan (CH$_3$SH), and small amounts of dithioformic acid (HC(S)SH) and methanedithiol (CH$_2$(SH)$_2$). The observed reactivity of CS$_2$ with H atoms provides a plausible explanation for the non-detection of CS$_2$ in interstellar ices. Furthermore, the efficient hydrogenation of the complex molecules derived from CS$_2$, namely HC(S)SH and CH$_2$(SH)$_2$, suggests that these species could be easily undergone with H atoms to produce other S-bearing species under ISM conditions.",

Elmegreen, Elena DOnghia 15 pages, 5 figures, Accepted for the ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Scattering of stars by interstellar clouds or massive clumps increases the stellar velocity dispersion and promotes a radial disk profile that is exponential. Here we show that such scattering reaches a steady-state distribution function of stellar eccentricity, after which eccentricity increases and decreases occur at equal rates. The implication is that clump/cloud scattering recircularizes eccentric stellar orbits, keeping the stellar velocity dispersion in a limited range. This re-circularization regulates disk heating and maintains kinematic coherence, contributing to the longevity of disk structures. The eccentricity distribution function and the presence of recircularizing cloud-star interactions are independent of cloud mass but the timescale to reach equilibrium decreases with increasing mass. The calculations are made in the simplest possible disk system to highlight the effects of scattering without contamination from spiral waves, star formation, and other processes. The calculations also reveal a bifurcation in the disk evolutions whereby in a minority of cases temporary asymmetries in the clump spatial distribution drive the disks to an end state of increased velocity dispersion and orbital eccentricity corresponding to early type disks. Overall the models emphasize an important physical process that can make and maintain an exponential stellar disk in all galaxies with a cloudy interstellar medium.",

Here, we utilize archival HST/ACS and JWST/NIRCam observations of the nearby dwarf star-forming galaxy WLM to study RR Lyrae in JWST filters. We independently identify RR Lyrae in HST and JWST imaging in order to evaluate JWST's efficacy at characterizing RR Lyrae in the near-IR. We use an MCMC template-fitting technique to obtain periods, amplitudes, and mean magnitudes from the RR Lyrae time-series data. The spatially overlapping HST and JWST observations allow us to directly compare the same sources observed with the instruments, and calibrate the NIRCam F090W and F150W RR Lyrae period-Wesenheit-metallicity (PWZ) relation to the Gaia-consistent HST PWZ. We additionally assess the epoch-to-epoch consistency of NIRCam photometry, and find evidence of burn-in. We conclude that the zero-point offset is negligible compared to the uncertainties from the template fitting. We conduct an MCMC fit of the PWZ with both HST and JWST data. Our results are three-fold. First, we find that we can reliably identify RR Lyrae in NIRCam data, but light-curve template fitting proves difficult on short-baseline observations. Second, the HST PWZ fit yields a distance modulus to WLM of $\\mu = 24.85\\pm0.05$ ($0.93\\pm0.02$ Mpc). This is closer than previous measurements, primarily attributed to consistency with the Gaia scale. Lastly, although the JWST PWZ fit has large uncertainties and a poorly-constrained slope, it represents a first-of-its-kind PWZ calibration in NIRCam filters.",

Kuiper, The XShootU collaboration Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Considering the physics of radiation-driven winds of massive stars, the wind properties should depend on the metal content of the stellar atmosphere. Therefore, studying the winds of massive stars in different metallicities provides a sanity check on prescriptions that are widely used in evolutionary calculations. We obtained the stellar and wind properties of a sample of 20 late-O and B supergiants in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) from a quantitative combined UV and optical spectroscopic analysis using CMFGEN. By comparing these properties with those of a Large Magellanic Cloud counterpart study, which has a similar sample and data, and employed the same modelling techniques used in this study, We derived a metallicity-dependent recipe for wind momentum, which is applicable for $5.4 \\leq \\log{L_{\\rm bol}/L_{\\odot}} \\leq6.1$ and $14 \\leq T_{\\rm eff}/{\\rm kK} \\leq 32$. We find a significant dependence of the wind momentum on the metallicity, which is largely due to the mass-loss rates. We do not find any evidence of a discontinuity in either the mass-loss rate or the ratio of the terminal wind velocity to the escape velocity between $25$ and $21$~kK, which could be attributed to the bi-stability jump. Stellar parameters are consistent across different methods and radiative transfer codes, whereas mass-loss rates differ significantly, with our values being generally lower. We find a discrepancy between the evolutionary and spectroscopic masses in $40\\%$ of our sample, with the evolutionary mass usually being systematically higher. The mass-loss rates of blue supergiants are far too low to strip the stellar envelope and the subsequent formation of classical Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, leading to the conclusion that luminous blue variable eruptions or binary interactions are necessary to explain the characteristics of the WR population in the SMC.",

Machida 10 pages, 6 figures, submitted to ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate how misalignment between the core angular momentum and the large-scale magnetic field affects protostellar outflows, and whether a single protostellar system can drive multiple outflow components. We perform three-dimensional nonideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetized rotating cores, focusing on the formation of a protostar, a circumstellar disk, and magnetically driven outflows. The initial angle between the core angular-momentum vector and the magnetic field is systematically varied from $0^\\circ$ to $90^\\circ$. All models launch a classical magnetocentrifugal disk wind (DW) roughly along the local disk normal. For large misalignment, the system also develops a spiralflow (SF) component that propagates parallel to the disk plane. In a representative model with a $60^\\circ$ misalignment, the outflow transitions from a DW-dominated to an SF-dominated phase, with the SF becoming more massive and more extended than the DW, and the two components intermittently coexisting. Across the model suite, the maximum mass and size ratios of SF to DW, as well as the relative lifetimes of the two components, increase for misalignment angles $\\gtrsim60^\\circ$. We propose that secondary, misaligned outflows (or their fossil remnants) observed in some protostellar systems can be interpreted as the SF component, while the main bipolar outflow traces the DW from the same misaligned system.",

The sample was selected based on s-process enrichment criteria involving the abundances of Ba and La relative to Eu, and further refined using the signed-distance method, resulting in the largest sample of Ba stars to date, including five newly identified Ba dwarfs. Using astrometric and kinematic parameters from Gaia DR3 and StarHorse, we derived the Galactic velocity components for 367 Ba stars and found that most belong to the thin or thick disk, while 18 exhibit halo-like kinematics. Chemical abundance analysis suggests that most Ba stars are of in situ origin, whereas two stars (4077588766331013248 and 6692980582560946304) display signatures of accreted populations. The E-Lz diagram further shows that star 4077588766331013248 lies within the region of substructure ED-8. The observed decline of [Ba/Fe] and [La/Fe] with increasing metallicity implies that s-process elements originate from nucleosynthetic sites distinct from those of iron-peak elements, while the decreasing [hs/ls] ratio toward higher metallicity indicates higher neutron capture efficiency at lower metallicity. Both giant and dwarf Ba stars-except for 6053735173729807872-are confirmed binaries hosting white dwarf companions. Moreover, we estimated the masses of the former asymptotic giant branch (AGB) companions to these Ba stars based on the good agreement between the FRUITY AGB model predictions and their observed abundance patterns.",

Xu 18 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables; accepted for publication in ApJ on January 10, 2026 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) One of the current challenges in galaxy evolution studies is to establish the mechanisms that govern the escape of ionizing radiation from galaxies. Here, we investigate the connection between Lyman Continuum (LyC) escape and the conditions of the Circumgalactic Medium (CGM), as probed by Ly$\\alpha$ halos (LAHs) in emission. We use Ly$\\alpha$ and UV continuum imaging data from the Lyman alpha and Continuum Origins Survey (LaCOS), targeting 42 nearby ($z \\simeq 0.3$), star-forming galaxies with LyC observations (escape fractions of $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm LyC} \\simeq 0.01-0.49$). LaCOS galaxies show extended Ly$\\alpha$ emission ubiquitously, with LyC emitters (LCEs) having more compact Ly$\\alpha$ morphologies than non-LCEs, and Ly$\\alpha$ spatial offsets that do not exceed the extent of the UV continuum. We model the diffuse LAHs using a combined Sérsic plus exponential 2D profile, and find that the characteristic scale length of the Ly$\\alpha$ halo is ten times larger than the UV, on average. We unveil a significant anti-correlation between $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm LyC}$ and the Ly$\\alpha$ Halo Fraction (HF, or contribution of the halo to the total Ly$\\alpha$ luminosity), that we propose as a new LyC indicator. Our observations show that halo scale lengths and HFs both scale positively with the optical depth of the neutral gas in the ISM, revealing a picture in which Ly$\\alpha$ and LyC photons in LCEs either emerge directly from the central starbursts or escape isotropically and, in the case of Ly$\\alpha$, minimize the number of scattering interactions in a less-extended CGM.",

This work aims to use a numerical framework that is a close match to the observed large-scale distribution of stars and gas in the MW to isolate and understand the impact of galaxy-driven flows on the formation, agglomeration, and longevity of spiral patterns, prior to the inclusion of chemistry, star formation, and feedback. We use an isothermal simulation of a MW-like galaxy, found to closely match the longitude-velocity observational features of the MW in previous work, that includes the coupled evolution of gas, stars, and dark matter under purely gravitational and hydrodynamical processes. We characterise the morphology and kinematics of the stars and gas in the disc, quantify velocity residuals and their association with spiral features, and analyse the time-evolution of individual spiral-ridge segments. Our results demonstrate that our model reproduces many observed MW structural and kinematic signatures, from the inner Galaxy to the Solar neighbourhood, supporting its suitability as an analogue of the MW. The stellar spiral pattern in our model is relatively weak and shows lower multiplicity relative to the sharper gaseous arms, offering an explanation for discrepancies in observational determinations of the number and location of MW spiral arms. Both gas and stellar spiral arms are highly segmented, without a single coherent spiral pattern as expected from a grand-design type of galaxy. We find strong radial motions linked to the non-circular motions driven by the presence of a bar, and which extend well into the disc. The gas radial and...",

From the redshifted absorption of the NaI doublet at $\\lambda \\lambda 5890, 5896 $ Ang, we estimate an inflow velocity $v=278^{+79}_{-79}$ km s$^{-1}$ and a column density $\\log(N_{NaI}/\\rm{cm^2}) = 13.02^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$.

The presence of several surrounding galaxies suggests that the galaxy may be accreting gas from nearby companions. However, we cannot confirm it with current data and the intergalactic medium or cosmic filaments are also viable sources of the inflowing gas. Despite the ongoing inflow, the galaxy remains quiescent, with an upper limit to the star formation rate of $0.2 \\, M_\\odot \\, \\rm{yr}^{-1}$. Moreover, its star formation history suggests that the galaxy has remained quiescent during the past $\\sim1$ Gyr, with half of its stars formed by redshift $z_{50}=11^{+18}_{-3}$. We discuss that the inflow is not massive, dense, or long-lived enough to ignite significant star formation, or it is fueling low-level AGN activity instead. This is direct evidence that quiescent galaxies can accrete cold gas after their quenching while keeping their star formation subdued. Follow-up observations with JWST and ALMA will be needed to constraint the nature of the inflowing gas.",

Accepted by ApJL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Galactic-scale outflows are a crucial component of galaxy evolution, yet their properties in the early universe remain poorly constrained. We present the first statistical investigation of \\ion{Mg}{2}-traced cool gas outflows in galaxies spanning a wide cosmic timeline from $z \\approx 1$ to $z > 6$ (with sample coverage extending to $z \\sim 10$). Using thousands of public JWST/NIRSpec spectra, we employ a signal-to-noise weighted spectral stacking technique on the \\ion{Mg}{2} $\\lambda\\lambda2796, 2803$ absorption doublet. We robustly detect blueshifted \\ion{Mg}{2} absorption in nearly all stellar mass and redshift bins, with the exception of the lowest-mass systems at $z \\sim 1-2$. The outflow equivalent width exhibits a positive correlation with stellar mass ($M_*$) at all epochs, with the fitted slope of $1.21 \\pm 0.35$. Our work provides the first statistical constraints on \\ion{Mg}{2}-traced cool outflows in the low-mass ($M_* \\lesssim 10^{9.5} \\, \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$), high-redshift ($z > 3$) regime. We also find that the outflow velocities generally remain below the host halo escape velocities, consistent with a galactic fountain scenario. The consistency of the stellar mass-outflow equivalent width relation across $z \\sim 2-6$ suggests a persistent, unevolving feedback mechanism governing the baryon cycle towards cosmic dawn.",

Accepted to ApJL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate large-scale gas kinematics in the multiphase circumgalactic medium (CGM) using the observed correlation between line width (Doppler $b$ parameter) and column density ($N$) for H I and O VI absorbers. Leveraging extensive public galaxy survey data at $z\\lesssim0.1$, we construct a new galaxy sample based on the availability of background Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSOs) with far-ultraviolet spectra from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). By combining this FUSE-galaxy sample with literature collections, we find that H I absorbers exhibit a clear inverse correlation between Doppler width and column density over nearly five orders of magnitude in $N_{\\rm HI}$, from $N_{\\rm HI} \\approx 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ to $N_{\\rm HI} \\approx 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, while O VI absorption follows a positive correlation across $N_{\\rm OVI}\\approx 3\\times10^{13}$-$10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$.We develop a model framework to interpret these contrasting trends and show that H I absorbers are best described as systems of approximately constant total column density ($N_{\\rm H}$), whereas O VI traces regions of roughly constant spatial density ($n_{\\rm H}$ and $n_{\\rm OVI}$). Under the latter scenario, the observed $b_{\\rm OVI}$-$N_{\\rm OVI}$ relation maps directly to a velocity-size relation consistent with a Kolmogorov-like turbulent spectrum. Together, these findings reveal a coherent physical picture in which H I and O VI trace a continuous turbulent cascade spanning more than five orders of magnitude in spatial scale-from cool, photoionized clumps to warm, highly ionized halo gas -- with accretion in the halo outskirts likely driving the turbulent energy injection that sustains the multiphase CGM.",

Koposov, Elena Maria Rossi, Zephyr Penoyre, Sill Verberne 12 pages, 5 figures, submitted to A&A, comments are welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are stars ejected from the Galactic Centre (GC) through tidal interactions with the central supermassive black hole. Formed in the immediate vicinity of Sgr~A$^\\ast$, these stars are accelerated to velocities high enough to escape the GC and be observable in the Galactic halo. Using spectroscopy from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and astrometry from Gaia, we conducted a six-dimensional search for HVSs and identified a compelling candidate, hereafter DESI-312, whose bound trajectory can be confidently traced back to the central 2 kpc of our galaxy. The star resides in the inner halo and exhibits supersolar metallicity ([Fe/H] $= 0.27\\pm 0.09$), distinct from other known stellar populations with radial orbits. Its inferred GC ejection velocity of $698^{+35}_{-27}$ is consistent with a Hills mechanism ejection, supporting an origin in the innermost regions of the Milky Way. We considered alternative origins for the star, including disk ejections from young clusters and globular clusters, but these scenarios fail to explain both its orbit and metallicity. Unlike previously identified A- and B-type HVSs, DESI-312 is a $\\sim 1\\,M_{\\odot}$ star on the main sequence or early subgiant branch, thus enabling a detailed chemical analysis of its atmosphere and offering a rare window - unobscured by dust and crowding - into the composition of the central regions of the Galaxy.",

We aim to investigate the morphological stability of 1,490 OCs and further explore the potential change of morphological stability of the OCs at different spatial positions, using the OC catalog from the literature. We define for the first time a new morphological stability parameter Ncore/Nouter, a ratio of member numbers between cluster core and outer areas within tidal radii, which has a significant positive correlation against N, with a slope of 1.140$\\pm$0.039, significantly steeper than the 0.720$\\pm$0.026 measured for Score/Souter. This demonstrates that the stellar density in the core is a more sensitive tracer for morphological stability than geometry. Spatially, the radial sample OCs have larger slopes of Ncore/Nouter and Score/Souter against N, with 1.083$\\pm$0.116 and 0.733$\\pm$0.080, respectively, whereas those in the tangential direction 1.013$\\pm$0.110 and 0.529$\\pm$0.075, respectively, which means that the impact on sample OCs from tidal forces directed toward the Galactic center is possibly stronger than that from the shear force caused by the differential rotation of the Galactic disk. Besides, the sample OCs younger than 30 Myr display a shallow slope of 0.751$\\pm$0.166, with those older than 800 Myr (1.442$\\pm$0.128), reflecting that young OCs likely endure both internal disruptions, such as early dynamical heating weakening core binding and more severe external disturbances, compared to older OCs.",

In many microlensing events, the lens, the source, or both may be a binary system. In this work, we introduce binary source and lens models into the gravitational lensing formalism encoded in the Bayesian Analysis of Gravitational Lensing Events (BAGLE) python software package. These new binary models in BAGLE account for Keplerian orbits. We also add binary models with fewer parameters that describe the binary orbital motion as acceleration, linear, or stationary motion of the secondary companion; these are useful when the orbit has a very low eccentricity or the orbital period is much longer than the microlensing timescale. The model parameterizations based on these binary lensing equations will enable joint fitting of photometric and astrometric data sets. Consequently, binary microlensing events with complex astrometric trajectories can be used to uniquely determine physical parameters like mass and distance, unlike photometry-only microlensing which often yield ambiguous solutions. These binary models will be used to fit microlensing event data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope, and other surveys.",

      "abstract": "CLiMB: A Domain-Informed Novelty Detection Clustering Framework for Galactic Archaeology and Scientific Discovery Lorenzo Monti, Tatiana Muraveva, Brian Sheridan, Davide Massari, Alessia Garofalo, Gisella Clementini, Umberto Michelucci Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) In data-driven scientific discovery, a challenge lies in classifying well-characterized phenomena while identifying novel anomalies. Current semi-supervised clustering algorithms do not always fully address this duality, often assuming that supervisory signals are globally representative. Consequently, methods often enforce rigid constraints that suppress unanticipated patterns or require a pre-specified number of clusters, rendering them ineffective for genuine novelty detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce CLiMB (CLustering in Multiphase Boundaries), a domain-informed framework decoupling the exploitation of prior knowledge from the exploration of unknown structures. Using a sequential two-phase approach, CLiMB first anchors known clusters using metric-adaptive constrained partitioning, and subsequently applies density-based clustering to residual data to reveal arbitrary topologies. We demonstrate this framework on RR Lyrae stars data from the Gaia Data Release 3. CLiMB attains an Adjusted Rand Index of 0.829 with 90% seed coverage in recovering known Milky Way substructures, outperforming heuristic and constraint-based baselines, which stagnate below 0.20. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis confirms CLiMB's superior data efficiency, showing monotonic improvement as knowledge increases. Finally, the framework successfully isolates three distinct dynamical features (Shiva, Shakti, and the Galactic Disk) in the unlabelled field, validating its potential for scientific discovery.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Most flares on the Sun occur at random, but there is a small percentage of \"sympathetic flaring\" -- the triggering of one flare by another. Previously there had been no widespread confirmation of sympathetic flares on other stars. In this work, we developed a new flare detection algorithm that is sensitive to closely-separated and overlapping stellar flares. We applied it to TESS data and discovered ~ 220,000 flares on ~ 16,000 stars, the majority of which are M-dwarfs. The wait time distribution between flares demonstrates an excess of closely-separated flares, relative to expectations from a Poisson process. We attribute this to sympathetic flares, occurring at a rate of between 4% and 9%, which matches the rate seen on the Sun. Our result is the first statistically robust detection of sympathetic flares on other stars, demonstrating a commonality between the Sun and low-mass stars.",

Poirier Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) The Sun is observed in unprecedented detail, enabling studies of its activity on very small spatiotemporal scales. However, the large volume of data collected by our telescopes cannot be fully analyzed with conventional methods. Popular machine learning methods identify general trends from observations, but tend to overlook unusual events due to their low frequency of occurrence. We study the applicability of unsupervised probabilistic methods to efficiently identify rare events in multidimensional solar observations and optimize our computational resources to the study of these extreme phenomena. We introduce Inspectorch, an open-source framework that utilizes flow-based models: flexible density estimators capable of learning the multidimensional distribution of solar observations. Once optimized, it assigns a probability to each sample, allowing us to identify unusual events. We apply this approach by applying it to observations from the Hinode Spectro-Polarimeter, the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, the Microlensed Hyperspectral Imager at Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on board Solar Orbiter. We find that the algorithm assigns consistently lower probabilities to spectra that exhibit unusual features. For example, it identifies profiles with very strong Doppler shifts, uncommon broadening, and temporal dynamics associated with small-scale reconnection events, among others. As a result, Inspectorch demonstrates that density estimation using flow-based models offers a powerful approach to identifying rare events in large solar datasets. The resulting probabilistic anomaly scores allow computational resources to be focused on the most informative and physically relevant events.

We analyzed light curves from Cycles 1-4 of the TESS mission, finding that for each NYMG member analyzed, at least one stellar flare was present. Flare candidates are initially detected using the AltaiPony flare package, followed by a recovery flare amplitudes, durations, and local continuum background levels. We examine the relationship between flare energy, age, and mass, finding a reduced flaring rate for late-type stars with age for high energy flares, as well as 5.5 times more flares detected in the 10-minute cadence TESS data compared to 30-minute cadence data. Additionally, flare events with extreme energies (E >= 10^{34} erg) on M-dwarf and solar-type stars, providing implications for further exploration into exoplanet habitability.",

French, Vadim M. Uritsky, Emily Mason, Cole A. Tamburri, Rahul Yadav, Benjamin J. Lynch Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) Recent three-dimensional flare models suggest that flare-ribbon substructure is linked to the fragmentation of the reconnecting current sheet in the corona. Flare-ribbon substructure can therefore potentially serve as a unique diagnostic tool for physical processes in the flare current sheet. In this paper, we describe a new method to quantify the evolution of ribbon substructure, which first extract the ribbon's leading bright front and the quantifies its morphology using the box-counting dimension and Correlation Dimension Mapping (CDM). We first test our method using synthetic observations. We then find that when the flare ribbon boundary has more multi-spatial-scale features (higher box-counting dimension), hard X-ray (HXR) emission and magnetic reconnection rates are the strongest. We also find that the flare-ribbon complexity characterized by CDM has moderate correlation with the IRIS Si IV 1402.77 Å non-thermal velocity (in the negative-polarity ribbon) and reconnection flux rates (in ribbons of both magnetic polarities). We conclude that the build-up of the spatial complexity of the ribbons at multiple spatial scales can serve as an observational proxy for current-sheet fragmentation in the corona.",

While rotational motions in jets are often attributed to magnetic field untwisting, alternative explanatory mechanisms remain possible. This study investigates a rotating jet in an active region observed on 2023 August 1 using multi-wavelength observations from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), Chinese Ha Solar Explorer (CHASE), and Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), combined with a self-consistent time-dependent magnetofrictional (TMF) model and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation. Spectral diagnostics reveal coexisting red and blue shifts along the edges and central axis of the jet, indicating helical plasma motion within a twisted magnetic structure. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the jet's rotation arises from plasma propagating along helical open field lines, formed via reconnection between a pre-existing flux rope and overlying magnetic fields. Contrary to classical untwisting models, both linear and rotational velocities decrease with altitude during the jet propagation. These results highlight that the observed rotation results from plasma spiral motion along twisted fields rather than untwisting dynamics of the magnetic field itself, providing new insights into solar jet energetics and their connection to broader solar phenomena.",

We examine the coupling between the photosphere and the chromosphere, studying the polarimetric signals during a period that encompasses the decaying phase of a C-class flare and the appearance of a new C-class flare at the same location. We focus on the analysis of various spectral lines. In particular, we study the Si I 10827 Å, Ca I 10833.4 Å, Na I 10834.9 Å, and Ca I 10838.9 Å photospheric lines, as well as the He I 10830 Å triplet. GRIS data revealed the presence of flare-related red- and blueshifted spectral line components, reaching Doppler velocities up to 90 km/s, and complex Si I profiles where the He i spectral line contribution is blueshifted. In contrast, the photospheric Ca i and Na i transitions remained unchanged, indicating that the flare did not modify the physical conditions of the lower photosphere. We combined that information with simultaneous imaging in the Ca ii H line and TiO band with the improved High-resolution Fast Imager (HiFI+), finding that the flare emission did not affect the inverse granulation or nearby plage, in agreement with the results from GRIS. We also complement the previous studies with a forward modelling computation, concluding that the He I spectral line emission reflects a complex response of the flaring chromosphere. Radiative excitation from coronal EUV irradiation, energy deposition by flare-accelerated electrons, and dynamic field-aligned plasma flows likely act together to produce the observed supersonic downflows and upflows. We plan to expand these findings through inversions of the He I 10830 Å triplet signals in the future.",

Therefore, understanding the physical processes during a solar flare and predicting its radiation profiles are of great importance. In this study, we analyze and model an M1.4 two-ribbon long-duration flare, whose multiple extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) emission peaks are found to correspond to different three-dimensional (3D) magnetic reconnections driven by the continuous evolution of a flux rope. In particular, the second and third peaks in the 335 Å EUV channel originate from longer and higher flare loops with extended cooling times, formed by reconnection between flux-rope field lines and ambient sheared-arcade field lines ($ar\\text{--}rf$) and between flux-rope field lines themselves ($rr\\text{--}rf$). These results are supported by the drifting of the flux-rope footpoint (and flare ribbon) and the decrease in toroidal flux of the flux rope, as well as by the connectivity transfer of representative field lines in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation. This work points out, for the first time, new manifestations of the 3D flare scenario in EUV light curves. On the one hand, it provides an explanation for two-ribbon late-phase flares. On the other hand, the conclusions presented here help bridge the gap between imaging observations, EUV light-curve diagnostics, and the magnetic structures of the associated coronal mass ejections.",

Refined astrometry confirms the positional consistency with a potential progenitor. Reliable estimates of the decline time (t3=10.7 +/- 0.5 d) and reddening (E(B-V)=1.6 +/- 0.1) enabled the application of the Maximum Magnitude - Rate of Decline relation, yielding a distance of 5.0 +/- 1.0 kpc in excellent agreement with 3D Galactic extinction maps. Around maximum light, the nova displayed a Fe II-type spectrum with very broad emission lines (FWZI 5800 km s-1) and high-velocity P-Cygni absorptions. Shortly after t3, coincident with the onset of hard X-ray emission, it showed pronounced photometric oscillations driven mainly by continuum variations. At the same time, He/N features developed alongside Fe II lines, identifying V615 Vul as a rare hybrid nova. During the nebular phase, the ionization level increased up to [Fe VII] and likely [Fe X].

Comments and questions welcome! Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The inner edge of the dead zone in protoplanetary disks has been shown to periodically go unstable, leading to accretion outbursts and annular substructure within the dead zone. While dust opacities play a key role in this process, the thermal and dynamical effects of dust drift and growth have not been fully explored. We investigate the evolution of accretion outbursts in the inner disk and their impact on the formation of dust-rich substructure with a fully dynamic dust model. In doing so, we aim to highlight the importance and limitations of dust growth in forming planets in this region. We carry out radiation hydrodynamics simulations of a protoplanetary disk including prescriptions for the structure of the inner edge of the dead zone, viscous and irradiation heating, radiative cooling, dust-gas dynamics, and dust evolution. We find that accretion outbursts at the inner disk edge can lead to the formation of multiple dust rings that extend deep inside the dead zone (~1 au) and diffuse on viscous timescales (~10 kyr for $\\alpha$=1e-4). The rings contain dust masses of up to ~1.6 Earth masses, possibly kickstarting planet formation. Dynamic modeling of dust fragmentation enhances the total opacity during the burst, yielding more intense outbursts that penetrate deeper into the dead zone. Our results highlight the thermal and dynamical importance of treating dust dynamics self-consistently in models of accretion outbursts. Additional modeling is needed to characterize the inevitable non-axisymmetric structures arising from accretion outbursts and their observational prospects.",

We detect the disks around MWC 480, HD 163296, and HD 143006 for the first time with SCExAO, and compare these observations with previous VLT/SPHERE datasets to identify surface-brightness variability. In MWC 480, we resolve two azimuthal brightness dips near the disk minor axis and find evidence that one of them shifted between 2021 and 2022. In HD 163296, we identify an apparent linear azimuthal motion of a localized peak in polarized intensity along the outer ring over a 15-month baseline. The rapid motion of these features relative to the local Keplerian velocity suggests that the observed variability is driven by changing illumination rather than physical material this http URL to uncertainties in the underlying scattering background, however, we cannot determine the precise physical origin of the variability. No significant disk variability is detected in HD 143006 over a 10-month baseline.

It was not until 1956 that domes and instruments specifically dedicated to observations of the photosphere and the solar chromosphere appeared. On the occasion of the International Geophysical Year, a solar spectroscopy laboratory was created to the west of the Pic du Midi, based on two spectrographs of 4 m and 9 m focal length. In 1961 the turret dome appeared to the east of the Pic, later equipped with an 8 m spectrograph. Around 1965, the Baillaud dome finally specialized in the corona with a new table and new spectrographs. At the same time, a revolution in infrastructure took place at the Pic in a few years, which we present as well as the solar spectrographs and their goal.",

Accepted for publication in Astronomy Reports Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The development of models for matter infall from a collapsing molecular cloud is an essential part of numerical studies on the formation and evolution of protoplanetary disks. In this article, the widely used Nakamoto and Nakagawa (1994) model is analyzed and modifications are proposed to complement the initial model. These improvements include calculation for the outer boundary of a molecular cloud and refinement of the initial density distribution within. Also, due to the finite size of a cloud, the approach for computing the rate of mass infall onto the protoplanetary disk during collapse is modified. The proposed enhancements are aimed at eliminating the key limitations of the initial model, but do not affect its advantages, such as simplicity in numerical implementation. Using the modified model, we investigate the duration of the embedded phase of the evolution of young stellar objects and compare the modeling results with observational data. The results indicate a shorter duration of the embedded phase of the evolution of young stellar objects, especially in star-forming regions with a high amplitude of the initial density perturbation of prestellar condensation.",

Amarsi Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Silver is a key tracer of the weak r-process in late-type stars. However, when the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) needs to be relaxed, accurate abundance determinations become even more sensitive to complete sets of reliable transition data. The aim of this work is to provide accurate and extensive results of excitation energies, radiative transition and hyperfine data for Ag I. The Multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) and relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) methods were used in the present work. The quantitative and qualitative evaluation (QQE) approach is applied to the MCDHF transition rates to estimate the uncertainty according to the National Institute of Science and Technology Atomic Spectroscopic Data (NIST ASD) terminology. Excitation energies, transition data and hyperfine structure constants were calculated for $18$ states up to $4d^{10}8s$. $57$ electric dipole (E1) transition rates and weighted oscillator strengths are computed and estimated to be in the following NIST ASD uncertainty classes; $4$ in AA, $12$ in A+, $5$ in A, $13$ in B+, $6$ in B, $4$ in C+ with AA $\\leq 1\\%$, A+ $\\leq 2\\%$, A $\\leq 3\\%$, B+ $\\leq 7\\%$, B $\\leq 10\\%$, C+ $\\leq 18\\%$. The remaining transitions, mainly weak transitions involving the $4d^95s^2$ states, are estimated to be in the E class $>50\\%$. The computed lifetimes from both the MCDHF and RCC methods are in good mutual agreement and mostly fall within the error bars of available experimental values from laser induced fluorescence (LIF) measurements. The $4d^95s^2~^2D_{5/2}$ metastable state, important for establishing the ionization balance, decay through an E2 transition to the ground state. The calculated lifetime is $163\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. The computed hyperfine interaction constants from the MCDHF and RCC methods are in good agreement and compare well with the scattered experimental constants.",

We propose a novel F10.7 index forecasting method using wavelet decomposition, which feeds F10.7 together with its decomposed approximate and detail signals into the iTransformer model. We also incorporate the International Sunspot Number (ISN) and its wavelet-decomposed signals to assess their influence on prediction performance. Our optimal method is then compared with the latest method from S. Yan et al. (2025) and three operational models (SWPC, BGS, CLS). Additionally, we transfer our method to the PatchTST model used in H. Ye et al. (2024) and compare our method with theirs on Dataset B. Key findings include: (1) The wavelet-based combination methods overall outperform the baseline using only F10.7 index. The prediction performance improves as higher-level approximate and detail signals are incrementally added. The Combination 6 method integrating F10.7 with its first to fifth level approximate and detail signals outperforms methods using only approximate or detail signals. (2) Incorporating ISN and its wavelet-decomposed signals does not enhance prediction performance. (3) The Combination 6 method significantly surpasses S. Yan et al. (2025) and three operational models, with RMSE, MAE, and MAPE reduced by 18.22%, 15.09%, and 8.57%, respectively, against the former method. It also excels across four different conditions of solar activity. (4) Our method demonstrates superior generalization and prediction capability over the method of H. Ye et al. (2024) across all forecast horizons. To our knowledge, this is the first application of wavelet decomposition in F10.7 prediction, substantially improving forecast performance.",

Korpi-Lagg, Mingde Ding Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Stellar coronae are believed to be the main birthplace of various stellar magnetic activities. However, the structures and properties of stellar coronae remain poorly understood. Using the Space Weather Modelling Framework with the Alfvén Wave Solar Model (SWMF-AWSoM) and dynamo-generated surface magnetic maps, here we model the coronae of four solar-type stars. By incorporating the Sun, our work covers a range of stars with the rotation varying from 1.0 to 23.3 $\\Omega_\\odot$ (periods of 25 to 1 days). Guided by observations, we scale the magnetic field strength with increasing rotation, covering a range between 6.0 G to 1200 G approximately. In our models, energy release associated with small-scale magnetic flux is a key source of coronal heating and is essential for reproducing realistic coronal structures. Our models capture dense (1$-$2 orders of magnitude higher than solar values) and ultra-hot ($\\sim 10\\,\\mathrm{MK}$) coronae dominated by closed field structures. Using the CHIANTI atomic database, we also compute synthetic X-ray spectra and derive the corresponding X-ray luminosities $(L_X)$, which follow a scaling law to magnetic field $L_X \\propto \\langle|\\mathbf{B}|\\rangle^{1.75}$. Furthermore, the coronal X-ray emission is found to be rotationally modulated by the alternating presence of bright active regions and dark coronal holes. These results provide new insights into the extremely high-energy coronae of rapidly rotating solar-type stars, which differ markedly from the Sun.",

Valori Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics; revisions pending. 13 pages. 13 figures Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) At low coronal temperatures around or below 1 MK distinct areas in the surroundings of active regions (AR) show emission at a level significantly below the emission coming from the quiet Sun (QS). These areas are referred to as dark halos, dark canopies, or dark moats. To better understand the nature of dark halos we study the connection between the photospheric magnetic field and coronal emission at different temperatures. Combining Solar Orbiter data from the high-resolution Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (SO/PHI) and Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instruments allows us to identify these areas that are dark in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) in the immediate vicinity of an AR. We probe both the photospheric magnetic field as well as the coronal intensities as a function of distance to the AR NOAA 12893. The dark halo has an unsigned magnetic flux density similar to the QS, but shows a strong radial dependence with distance from the AR centre. It drops by 38 % from 6.1 G at the inner boundary to 3.8 G at the outer, shifting from above to below QS levels. Coronal emission $\\leq$1 MK is $\\sim$40 % below QS and shows no dependence on distance to the AR centre. In contrast, at $\\geq$1.6 MK, emission exceeds QS levels, but declines outward toward QS values. A few hot loops extend from the AR periphery across the halo, while at lower temperatures no such loops appear and short loops dominate the corona. The reduced unsigned magnetic flux density in the outermost parts of the dark halo, below QS level, suggests that reduced coronal heating due to weak underlying magnetic flux heating could be partially responsible for the reduced emission around 1 MK. Closer to the AR, other mechanisms might lead to reduced heating. The different loops structures detected for hotter and cooler coronal temperatures likely play a crucial role in understanding coronal dark halos.",

Prior work has advanced HOWFSC algorithms and profiled candidate implementations on radiation-hardened processors, highlighting a substantial gap between the computational demands of LUVOIR-scale HOWFSC and the capabilities of current onboard spacecraft hardware. In this paper, we argue that this gap can be closed by offloading the HOWFSC pipeline to a dedicated co-flying compute satellite at Sun-Earth L2. This approach enables the use of modern, radiation-tolerant high-performance processors without increasing risk to the primary observatory. We show that such an architecture can increase the end-to-end control cadence from the sub-hertz regime typical of radiation-hardened onboard processing or ground-in-the-loop operation to tens and even hundreds of hertz. We evaluate commercial hardware platforms in terms of performance and feasibility, and we propose custom architectures that enable higher control frequencies with significant power consumption reductions. Finally, we outline system-level considerations for co-flying compute, including reliability, satellite integration, and inter-satellite communication constraints.",

Hambly, Lennart Lindegren, Javier Castañeda, Claus Fabricius, Jose Hernández, Dafydd W. Evans 28 pages, 30 figures, 5 tables. Accepted for publication in A&A Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) An accurate model of the point spread function is required in order to estimate positions and brightnesses of stars in digitized images. The PSF of the Gaia space telescope is unusual due to the use of drift-scan mode and time-delayed integration, in which the satellite spins and precesses while images are captured. This induces several systematic and periodic distortions in the PSF that are unique to Gaia. These include systematic variations in the stellar image drift rate with respect to the charge transfer rate, and spatial variations in the CCD response that are, contrary to expectations, not marginalised by the use of TDI mode. These must be incorporated into the PSF model in order to reduce systematic errors in Gaia's data products. We have developed a semi-analytic model of the PSF, in which the blurring effects of along- and across-scan stellar image motion are modelled analytically, and dependences of the PSF shape on source colour and position within the CCD are calibrated empirically. Constraints on the PSF origin are introduced in order to break a degeneracy with the geometric instrument calibration. Our new PSF model leads to significant improvements in the modelling of observations, particularly around the 11-13 magnitude range in G. This will contribute to reductions in the astrometric and photometric uncertainties in the derived data products. Our PSF model was deployed in the Gaia cyclic data processing systems and used in the production of the forthcoming Data Release 4. The linear part of Gaia's PSF is now well understood. Future development work will focus on the handling of several nonlinear effects that depend on the signal level, including charge transfer inefficiency and the brighter-fatter effect. This work will provide a useful reference for users of Gaia data and for other missions that use the same observing principles, such as the proposed GaiaNIR mission.",

Its main goal is to find the long-sought origin of UHE cosmic rays by detecting large numbers of them and the secondary particles created by their interactions like gamma rays and neutrinos. The GRAND Collaboration plans to achieve this using large arrays of radio antennas that look for the radio signals emitted by the air showers initiated by the interactions of the UHE particles in the atmosphere. Since 2023, three small-scale prototype GRAND arrays have been in operation: GRAND@Nançay in France, GRAND@Auger in Argentina, and GRANDProto300 in China. Together, their goal is to validate the detection principle of GRAND under prolonged field conditions, achieving efficient, autonomous radio-detection of air showers. We describe the hardware, software, layout, and operation of the GRAND prototypes. Using their data, we show a first characterization of the local electromagnetic environment of each site and a measurement of the Galactic synchrotron emission. Despite challenges, the successful operation of the prototypes confirms that the GRAND instrumentation is apt to address the goals of the experiment and lays the groundwork for its ensuing stages.",

Lopez, Gennady Fiksel Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE) This paper provides experimental and numerical evidence supporting the occurrence of liposome congregation at the floors of meteor craters on Early Earth. This work builds on our earlier research, which demonstrated that liposomes submerged in a shallow Archean pond are protected from harmful UV radiation. This protection allows them to survive long enough for autocatalytic replication of amphiphiles and for mutation and selection of assemblies that maximize membrane stability. For liposomes to fuse, grow, exchange contents and membranes, and divide, they need to establish a population, which means forming a dense conglomerate that enables close physical contact. The study demonstrates that such a congregation is feasible in bowl-shaped meteor craters on Early Earth, especially under periodic seismic disturbances.",

Here we cataloged 335 notable collisional families in the main asteroid belt. When possible, we estimated each family's formation age, mean visible albedo, taxonomic type, and parent body size. We found that older families (t_age>10 Myr) produced by impacts on small parent bodies (diameter D<5 km) are rarely identified because small members of these families have drifted over time by the Yarkovsky effect and blended with the background. The young families (t_age<10 Myr) typically have small parent bodies (D<10 km) as large asteroids do not disrupt often enough.

By incorporating stochastic forcing (parameterized by $\\kappa$) alongside laminar angular momentum and eccentricity damping timescales ($\\tau_{\\rm m}, \\tau_{e}$), we derive an analytical criterion for the general $j:j-1$ mean motion resonances, and validate it through N-body simulations. The outcome is mapped in $\\kappa$-$\\tau_{\\rm m}/\\tau_{e}$ parameter space, revealing two distinct regimes: resonance trapping and turbulence-induced disruption -- which occurs either directly cross or via temporary capture followed by escape through turbulent diffusion. Crucially, our analysis identifies turbulence as a universal destabilizer. It amplifies the intrinsic overstability mechanism: In laminar disks, escape requires $\\tau_{\\rm m}/\\tau_{e}$ to drop below a critical limit due to excessive eccentricity excitation. We demonstrate that turbulent diffusion lowers this limit, demanding stronger damping (larger $\\tau_{\\rm m}/\\tau_{e}$) for stability. Thus, greater turbulence promotes escape, and sufficiently strong diffusion precludes resonance retention irrespective of eccentricity damping.",

These systems were initially identified as transiting candidates using light curves generated from the full-frame images of the TESS mission. We confirmed the planetary nature of these objects with ground-based spectroscopic follow-up observations using FEROS and the new PLATOSpec spectrograph attached to the ESO 1.52 m telescope at the La Silla Observatory, and with ground-based photometric observations of the Observatoire Moana, Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope and ASTEP. From a global fit to the photometry and radial velocities, we determine that the planet TIC 147027702b has a low-eccentric orbit ($e = 0.13 \\pm 0.05$) with a period of 44.4 days and has a mass of $1.09^{+0.07}_{-0.13}$ M$_J$ and a radius of $0.98 \\pm 0.06$ R$_J$. TIC 245076932b has a moderately low mass of $0.51 \\pm 0.05$ M$_J$, a radius of $0.97 \\pm 0.05$ R$_J$, and an eccentric orbit ($e = 0.43 \\pm 0.02$) with a period of 21.6 days. TIC 87422071b has a mass of $1.29 \\pm 0.10$ M$_J$, a radius of $0.97 \\pm 0.08$ R$_J$, and has a slightly eccentric orbit ($e = 0.12 \\pm 0.07$) with a period of 11.3 days. These well-characterised warm Jupiters expand the currently limited sample of similar gas giants and provide valuable benchmarks for testing models of giant-planet formation, migration, and tidal evolution.",

Submitted to MNRAS Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Photosynthesis is central to Earth's biosphere and a prime candidate for sustaining complex life on habitable exoplanets, yet a thermodynamically consistent treatment of the work potential of stellar radiation at planetary surfaces is still lacking. We develop a radiative-thermodynamic framework that quantifies the maximum useful work extractable for a given star-planet configuration and yields exergy-based bounds on photosynthetic power and long-wavelength absorption cutoffs. From these we derive kinetically constrained red limits for high-$\\Delta G$ photochemistry and apply them to Earth-like planets receiving the same bolometric flux from FGK and M blackbody hosts, computing thresholded photon supplies and truncated exergy fluxes below a photosystem II red limit. For such planets the constraints confine single-photon oxygenic photosynthesis to near-infrared bands around Solar-type stars and to somewhat bluer wavelengths around late M dwarfs. Integrated over the stellar spectrum, the thresholded photon supply and truncated exergy available to drive a photosystem water-oxidation step are larger by factors $\\sim 5$ around FGK hosts than around $T_\\star\\approx 3000$~K M dwarfs. For the Solar-Earth system, the exergy-based upper bound on O$_2$ production exceeds the observed O$_2$ throughput by several orders of magnitude, consistent with Earth's photosynthetic efficiencies. Cool M dwarfs suffer a double penalty: fewer photons above threshold and a lower shortwave exergy fraction, yielding systematically tighter ceilings on high-$\\Delta G$ photosynthesis than around FGK stars. Our framework provides upper limits on photosynthetically harvestable power on habitable-zone planets and enables comparisons of photosynthetic potential across exoplanetary systems, and can be extended to multi-band photosystems.",

In previous studies, stepwise alternating field demagnetization (AFD) measurements of natural remanent magnetization (NRM) records have been conducted on seven Ryugu particles. However, due to the limited number of samples, there is no consensus regarding the interpretation of the results of these measurements. To address this problem, we performed stepwise AFD measurements of the NRM on 28 Ryugu particles. Twenty-three of the particles exhibited one or two stable NRM components, whereas the remaining five did not. Isothermal remanent magnetization-based paleointensity values derived from stable NRM components varied by more than one order of magnitude. These NRM characteristics were consistent with those observed in previous studies. Therefore, as a reflection of the original nature of the NRM record, some Ryugu particles exhibited stable NRM components, whereas others did not. The Ryugu particles investigated in this study and those from a previous study exhibited spatially inhomogeneous NRM directions within individual particles, constraining the NRM acquisition time to before the final solidification of the current Ryugu particles. A mechanism of remanence acquisition that can explain the observed NRM characteristics is a chemical remanent magnetization associated with the growth of framboidal magnetite during aqueous alteration in Ryugu's parent body.",

Updated to reflect published version in ApJ The Astrophysical Journal, Volume 995, Issue 1, id.95, 2025 Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Sub-Neptunes with substantial atmospheres may possess magma oceans in contact with the overlying gas, with chemical interactions between the atmosphere and magma playing an important role in shaping atmospheric composition. Early JWST observations have found high abundances of carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules in a number of sub-Neptune atmospheres, which may result from processes including accretion of icy material at formation or magma-atmosphere interactions. Previous work examining the effects of magma-atmosphere interactions on sub-Neptunes has mostly been limited to studying conditions at the atmosphere-mantle boundary, without considering implications for the upper atmosphere which is probed by spectroscopic observations. In this work, we present a modeling architecture to determine observable signatures of magma-atmosphere interactions. We combine an equilibrium chemistry code which models reactions between the core, mantle and atmosphere with a radiative-convective model that determines the composition and structure of the observable upper atmosphere. We examine how different conditions at the atmosphere-mantle boundary and different core and mantle compositions impact the upper atmospheric composition. We compare our models to JWST NIRISS+NIRSpec observations of the sub-Neptune TOI-270~d, finding that our models can provide a good fit to the observed transmission spectrum with little fine-tuning. This suggests that magma-atmosphere interactions may be sufficient to explain high abundances of molecules such as H$_2$O, CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ in sub-Neptune atmospheres, without additional accretion of icy material from the protoplanetary disk. Although other processes could lead to similar compositions, our work highlights the need to consider magma-atmosphere interactions when interpreting the observed atmospheric composition of a sub-Neptune.",

      "abstract": "The Oxygen Valve on Hydrogen Escape Since the Great Oxidation Event Gregory J. Cooke, Dan R. Marsh, Catherine Walsh, Felix Sainsbury-Martinez, Marrick Braam 35 pages, 7 figures, 1 table. Accepted for publication in Climate of the Past Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph) The Great Oxidation Event (GOE) was a $200$ Myr transition circa 2.4 billion years ago that converted the Earth's anoxic atmosphere to one where molecular oxygen (O$_2$) was abundant (volume mixing ratio $>10^{-4}$). This significant rise in O$_2$ is thought to have substantially throttled hydrogen (H) escape and the associated water (H$_2$O) loss. Atmospheric estimations from the GOE onward place O$_2$ concentrations ranging between 0.1% to 150% PAL, where PAL is the present atmospheric level of 21% by volume. In this study we use WACCM6, a three-dimensional Earth System Model to simulate Earth's atmosphere and predict the diffusion-limited escape rate of hydrogen due to varying O$_2$ post-GOE. We find that O$_2$ indirectly acts as a control valve on the amount of hydrogen atoms reaching the homopause in the simulations: less O$_2$ leads to decreased O$_3$ densities that reduce local tropical tropopause temperatures by up to 17 K, which increases H$_2$O freeze-drying and thus reduces the primary source of hydrogen in the considered scenarios. The maximum differences between all simulations in the total H mixing ratio at the homopause and the associated diffusion-limited escape rates are a factor of 3.2 and 4.7, respectively. The prescribed CH$_4$ mixing ratio (0.8 ppmv) sets a minimum diffusion escape rate of $\\approx 2 \\times 10^{10}$ mol H yr$^{-1}$, effectively a negligible rate when compared to pre-GOE estimates ($\\sim10^{12}-10^{13}$ mol H yr$^{-1}$). Because the changes in our predicted escape rates are comparatively minor, our numerical predictions support geological evidence that the majority of Earth's hydrogen escape occurred prior to the GOE. Our work demonstrates that estimations of how the hydrogen escape rate evolved through Earth's history requires 3D chemistry-climate models which include a global treatment of water vapour microphysics.",

      "abstract": "Exoplanet transit search at the detection limit: detection and false alarm vetting pipeline Jakob Robnik, Uroš Seljak, Jon M. Jenkins, Steve Bryson Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) One of the primary mission goals of the Kepler space telescope was to detect Earth-like terrestrial planets in the habitable zone around Sun-like stars. These planets are at the detection limit, where the Kepler detection and vetting pipeline produced unreliable planet candidates. We present a novel pipeline that improves the removal of localized defects prior to the planet search, improves vetting at the level of individual transits and introduces a Bayes factor test statistic and an algorithm for extracting multiple candidates from a single detection run. We show with injections in the Kepler data that the introduced novelties improve pipeline's completeness at a fixed false alarm rate. We apply the pipeline to the stars with previously identified planet candidates and show that our pipeline successfully recovers the previously confirmed candidates, but flags a considerable portion of unconfirmed candidates as likely false alarms, especially in the long period, low signal-to-noise ratio regime. In particular, several known Earth-like candidates in the habitable zone, such as KOI 8063.01, 8107.01 and 8242.01, are identified as false alarms, which could have a significant impact on the estimates of $\\eta_{\\oplus}$, i.e., the occurrence of Earth-like planets in the habitable zone.",
