Using an updated version of the GAMETE/QSOdust semi-analytical model, we implement a simple dust shielding prescription that accounts for the absorption of LW photons by dust grains. We find that even modest dust enrichment can significantly reduce the effective LW radiation field, allowing H2 cooling to persist in regions previously thought to be affected by LW feedback. This changes the conditions for seed formation, particularly for heavy seeds which require suppression of H2 cooling. Our results suggest that dust shielding extends the redshift range and volume where heavy seeds can form, and significantly alters the relative importance of different seed populations. We discuss the implications for the formation of high-redshift SMBHs and future observations.",

      "abstract": "Systematic Effects of Chaotic Magnetic Fields on Neutron Star Tidal Deformability: Implications for Gravitational Wave Constraints on Dense Matter Debarshi Mukherjee High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate the effects of strong magnetic fields on the equation of state (EoS) of neutron star matter and the resulting implications for tidal deformability measurements in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. A critical issue with previous magnetized neutron star studies is the treatment of magnetic field anisotropy in the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations. To address this fundamental problem, we employ the chaotic magnetic field approximation, which allows for a self-consistent treatment of magnetic pressure while maintaining isotropy. Using a relativistic mean field approach with properly implemented magnetic field corrections, we compute mass-radius relations and tidal deformability parameters for neutron stars with magnetic field strengths ranging from $10^{15}$ to $10^{16}$ G. Our systematic study reveals that magnetic fields induce increases in both stellar radii (0.8--2.3\\%) and tidal deformabilities (4.2--18.1\\%) compared to field-free cases, with effects scaling approximately as $B^{1/2}$. These modifications, while modest, are potentially detectable with current and next-generation gravitational wave detectors. For a canonical $1.4\\,M_\\odot$ neutron star, the tidal deformability increases from $\\Lambda_{1.4} = 678 \\times 10^6$ in the absence of magnetic fields to $\\Lambda_{1.4} = 803 \\times 10^6$ for $B = 10^{16}$ G. We demonstrate that magnetic field effects must be considered when constraining the neutron star equation of state using gravitational wave observations, particularly for populations including highly magnetized neutron stars. Our results suggest that the current GW170817 constraint on tidal deformability may require systematic corrections when accounting for magnetic field effects. We provide scaling relations for magnetic field corrections and discuss the implications for population studies of neutron star mergers with next-generation detectors.",

Comments are welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The GeV $\\gamma$-ray excess observed towards the Galactic Centre remains unexplained. While dark matter annihilation has long been considered a leading interpretation, an alternative scenario involving a large population of millisecond pulsars has not been ruled out. Testing this hypothesis with electromagnetic observations is difficult, as pulsar searches in the bulge are strongly affected by scattering, high sky temperature, and source confusion. We investigate whether gravitational-wave observations with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) could provide an independent probe of the millisecond pulsar binary population in the Galactic bulge. We construct synthetic populations of millisecond pulsar-white dwarf binaries under two illustrative formation scenarios: an accreted scenario, in which systems are deposited by disrupted globular clusters, and an in situ scenario, in which binaries form through isolated binary evolution. In both cases, only $10^{-5}$--$10^{-4}$ of the underlying bulge population is detectable by LISA. Nevertheless, even a few detections would imply tens to hundreds of thousands of unseen systems. Accreted binaries are expected to have lower chirp masses ($\\sim$0.4 M$_\\odot$), while in situ binaries produce more massive companions ($\\sim$0.9 M$_\\odot$). LISA will measure binary frequencies with high precision, but chirp masses can only be determined for the most massive or highest-frequency systems. Distinguishing millisecond pulsar binaries from the far more numerous double white dwarfs will be challenging, though LISA detections could provide valuable targets for follow-up with the Square Kilometre Array, enabling a critical test of the millisecond pulsar origin of the $\\gamma$-ray excess.",

Hertzberg, Daniel Jiménez-Aguilar, Iman Khan Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) In this work we examine the 2025 DESI analysis of dark energy, which suggests that dark energy is evolving in time with an increasing equation of state $w$. We explore a wide range of quintessence models, described by a potential function $V(\\varphi)$, including: quadratic potentials, quartic hilltops, double wells, cosine functions, Gaussians, inverse powers. We find that while some provide improvement in fitting to the data, compared to a cosmological constant, the improvement is only modest. We then consider non-minimally coupled scalars which can help fit the data by providing an effective equation of state that temporarily obeys $w<-1$ and then relaxes to $w>-1$. Since the scalar is very light, this leads to a fifth force and to time evolution in the effective gravitational strength, which are both tightly constrained by tests of gravity. For a very narrow range of carefully selected non-minimal couplings we are able to evade these bounds, but not for generic values.",

Sullivan, Xingyu Ji, Doğa Veske, Imre Bartos, Sebastian Will, Zsuzsa Márka, Szabolcs Márka Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Gravitational-wave astronomy has developed enormously over the last decade with the first detections and continuous development across broad frequency bands. However, the decihertz range has largely been left out of this development. Gravitational waves in this band are emitted by some of the most enigmatic sources, including intermediate-mass binary black hole mergers, early inspiraling compact binaries$\\unicode{x2014}$whose late evolution and merger are seen by Earth-based detectors$\\unicode{x2014}$, and possibly primordial gravitational waves. To tap this exciting band, we propose the construction of a detector based on pulsar timing principles, the Artificial Precision Timing Array (APTA). We envision APTA as a solar system array of artificial ``pulsars''$\\unicode{x2014}$precision-time-reference-carrying satellites that emit periodic electromagnetic signals towards Earth or other satellite constellation centrum. In this fundamental study, we estimate the clock precision needed for APTA to be able to detect gravitational waves. Our results suggest that 6 satellites and a clock relative uncertainty of $10^{-18}$ at 1 s of averaging, which is currently attainable with atomic clocks, would be sufficient for APTA to reach pristine sensitivity in the decihertz band and be sensitive to $10^3\\unicode{x2013}10^4$ $\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ black hole mergers and the early inspiral of heavy LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA sources. Future time reference, oscillator, and clock technologies realistically expected in the next decade(s) would enable the detection of an increasingly diverse set of sources and allow APTA to reach a better sensitivity than other detector concepts proposed for the decihertz band. This work opens up a new area of research into designing and constructing gravitational-wave detectors relying on principles used successfully in pulsar timing.",

One approach to establishing a detection criterion for the SGWB is using Bayesian evidence. If the evidence ratio (Bayes factor) between models with and without the signal exceeds a certain threshold, the signal is considered detected. We present a formalism to compute the averaged Bayes factor, incorporating instrumental-noise and SGWB uncertainties. As an example, we consider the case of power-law-shaped SGWB in LISA and generate the corresponding Bayesian sensitivity curve. Unlike existing methods in the literature, which typically neglect uncertainties in both the signal and noise, our approach provides a reliable and realistic alternative. This flexible framework opens avenues for more robust stochastic gravitational wave background detection across gravitational-wave experiments.",

Motivated by quantum field theoretic considerations of vacuum decay and adiabatic particle production, we analyse both the background dynamics and the growth rate of perturbations. The model is confronted with diverse datasets, including Cosmic Chronometers, Pantheon Type Ia Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Cosmic Microwave Background distance priors, weighted linear growth rate measurements and an $H_0$ prior, with parameter estimation performed via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Model comparison is carried out using the Akaike and Deviance Information Criterion. Our results show a consistent transition from a decelerated to an accelerated expansion phase, with present Hubble parameter estimates lying between the Planck and SH0ES values, thereby easing the Hubble tension. The structure growth parameter $S_8$ is also compatible with Planck 2018 and recent weak lensing surveys. A thermodynamic analysis confirms consistency with the generalized second law, and including Casimir contributions provides further insights into the model's dynamics. Overall, the proposed model effectively captures the Universe's evolution at both theoretical and observational levels.}",

Zitrin Submitted to ApJ. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2404.02139 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Multiply-imaged supernovae (SNe) provide a novel means of constraining the Hubble constant ($H_0$). Such measurements require a combination of precise models of the lensing mass distribution and an accurate estimate of the relative time delays between arrival of the multiple images. Only two multiply-imaged SNe, Refsdal and H0pe, have enabled measurements of $H_0$ thus far. Here we detail the third such measurement for SN Encore, a $z=1.95$ SNIa discovered in JWST/NIRCam imaging. We measure the time delay, perform simulations of additional microlensing and millilensing systematics, and combine with the mass models of Suyu et al. in a double-blind analysis to obtain our $H_0$ constraint. Our final time-delay measurement is $\\Delta t_{1b,1a}=-39.8_{-3.3}^{+3.9}$ days, which is combined with seven lens models weighted by the likelihood of the observed multiple image positions for a result of $H_0=66.9_{-8.1}^{+11.2} \\rm{km} \\rm{s}^{-1}\\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The uncertainty on this measurement could be improved significantly if template imaging is obtained. Remarkably, a sibling to SN Encore (SN \"Requiem\") was discovered in the same host galaxy, making the MACS J0138.0-2155 cluster the first system known to produce more than one observed multiply-imaged SN. SN Requiem has a fourth image that is expected to appear within a few years, providing an unprecedented decade-long baseline for time-delay cosmography and an opportunity for a high-precision joint estimate of $H_0$.",

We present seven independent mass models of the galaxy cluster built using six software packages. By conducting a blind analysis (no exchanges of results between modeling teams), we quantified uncertainties due to modeling and software. Through HST, JWST and MUSE observations, we assembled high-quality data products, including eight \"gold\" lensed image systems consisting of 23 images with secure spectroscopic redshifts, and one \"silver\" system with a likely redshift value. Restricting to the gold images, we obtain overall consistent model predictions of the positions, magnifications and time delays of SN Encore and SN Requiem images, especially for models with $\\chi^2 \\leq 25$. We predict the appearance of the next images of SNe Encore and Requiem with a time delay of >~3000 days and of ~3700 to 4000 days, respectively, based on a fiducial cosmological model of $H_0 = 70 {\\rm\\ km\\ s^{-1}\\ Mpc^{-1}}$ and $\\Omega_{\\rm m} = 0.3$. We obtain relations between $H_0$ and the time delays of SNe Encore and Requiem. In particular, for $H_0 = 73 {\\rm\\ km\\ s^{-1}\\ Mpc^{-1}}$, the four lowest $\\chi^2$ models predict SN Requiem to reappear in ~Apr-Dec 2026; for $H_0 = 67 {\\rm\\ km\\ s^{-1}\\ Mpc^{-1}}$, in ~Mar-Nov 2027. Using the newly measured time delay between the two detected images of SN Encore by Pierel et al. (submitted) and our mass models, we jointly infer $H_0 = {\\rm 66.9^{+11.2}_{-8.1}\\ km\\ s^{-1}\\ Mpc^{-1}}$, where the uncertainty is dominated by that of the time delay. The long delays of the next-appearing SN Requiem and SN Encore images provide excellent opportunities to measure $H_0$ with an uncertainty of 2-3%. Our mass models form the basis for cosmological inference from this unique lens cluster with two strongly lensed SNe. (Abridged)",

In this approach, we phenomenologically impose a shorter sound horizon without modeling early-universe physics to isolate its impact on late-time dark energy inference. Using baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), supernovae (SN), big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), and local $H_0$ data, while explicitly avoiding CMB anisotropies, we examine how this calibration shift propagates into constraints on the dark energy equation of state. We find that lowering $r_d$ systematically drives the $w_0$-$w_a$ posterior toward less dynamical, quintessence-like behavior, bringing it closer to $\\Lambda$CDM. This result underscores that some of the apparent evidence for evolving or phantom-like dark energy may reflect early-universe assumptions rather than genuine late-time dynamics. More broadly, our analysis highlights the importance of carefully disentangling calibration effects from physical evolution in interpreting forthcoming results from DESI and future surveys.",

We explore a range of initial conditions and potential configurations that facilitate such a phantom-to-quintessence-like crossing, and find that this can be naturally realised with hill-top or cliff-face potentials bound from above. We study how varying these conditions affects the dynamics of the system, calculate the background observables and compare them with DESI, CMB, and Type Ia supernova data, identifying a viable parameter space for our model. In particular, we find that a potential featuring a hyperbolic tangent form can successfully reproduce the desired phantom crossing, although such models can suffer from fine-tuning effects. Finally, we discuss prospects for distinguishing such models with upcoming state-of-the-art cosmological observations.",

Krause Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex) The nature of dark energy remains one of the most important unanswered problems in physics. Here we use gamma-ray spectra from the Type Ia supernova 1991T to constrain the recent evolution of a dynamical pseudoscalar quintessence-like field $Q(t)$. We found that the 1991T gamma rays emitted by the $^{56}\\text{Fe}$ nuclei observed by COMPTEL aboard the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory were slightly shifted to lower energies with respect to terrestrial values, with the average fractional energy shift of both the first and second excited states found to be $\\delta E/E = -0.006\\pm0.008$ including statistical and systematic errors. Assuming that this energy shift is caused by a dynamical QCD axion-like pseudoscalar field $Q(t)$, we find that observed energy deviations are consistent with a fractional rate of change of the pion mass given by $\\delta \\dot{m_{\\pi}}/m_{\\pi}=-(6\\pm9)\\times10^{-11}\\text{ yr}^{-1}$. The observed energy deviation was also used to determine the rate of change of the quintessence-like field ($\\dot{Q}_0$) for tracking models: $\\dot{Q}_{0,max} = (3\\pm 4)\\times10^7 \\text{ GeV/yr}$. Our findings are consistent with the cosmological constant ($\\dot{Q}_0 =0$). Furthermore, we have demonstrated how nuclear spectra produced by astrophysical events can be used to inform the nature and behavior of dark energy.",

      "abstract": "Parity in Composite-Field Galaxy Correlators Zucheng Gao, Azadeh Moradinezhad Dizgah, Zvonimir Vlah Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Detecting parity violation on cosmological scales would provide a striking clue to new physics. Large-scale structure offers the raw statistical power -- many three-dimensional modes -- to make such tests. However, for scalar observables, like galaxy clustering, the leading parity-sensitive observable is the trispectrum, whose high dimensionality makes the measurement and noise estimation challenging. We present two late-time parity-odd kurto spectra that compress the parity-odd scalar trispectrum into one-dimensional, power-spectrum-like observables. They are built by correlating (i) two appropriately weighted quadratic composite fields, or (ii) a linear and cubic composite field, constructed from dark matter (DM) or galaxy overdensity fields. We develop an FFTLog pipeline for efficient theoretical predictions of the two observables. We then validate the estimators for a specific parity-odd primordial template on perturbative DM field, and on DM and halo fields in full N-body \\texttt{Quijote} simulations, with and without parity-odd initial conditions, in real and redshift space. For DM, the variance is dominated by the parity-even contribution -- i.e., the gravitationally induced parity-even trispectrum -- and is efficiently suppressed by phase-matched fiducial subtraction. For halos, discreteness-driven stochasticity dominates and is not appreciably reduced by subtraction; however, optimal weighting and halo-matter cross kurto spectra considerably mitigate this noise and enhance the signal. Using controlled down-sampling of the matter field, we empirically calibrate how the parity-even variance scales with number density and volume, and provide an illustrative forecast for the detectability of parity-odd kurto spectra in a Euclid-like spectroscopic galaxy survey.",

To be submitted to MNRAS. Comments welcome! Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) DES-5Y supernovae, combined with DESI BAO, appear to favour Chevallier-Polarski-Linder $(w_0, w_a)$ dynamical dark energy over $\\Lambda$CDM. arXiv:2408.07175 suggested that this is driven by a systematic in the DES pipeline, which particularly affects the low-redshift supernovae brought in from legacy surveys. It is difficult to investigate these data in isolation, however, as the complicated supernovae pipelines must properly account for selection effects. In this work, we discover that the Bayesian evidence previously found for flexknot dark energy (arXiv:2503.17342) is beaten by a magnitude offset between the low- and high-redshift supernovae. In addition, we find that the possible tension between DES-5Y and DESI is significantly reduced by such an offset. We also take the opportunity to trial Nested Bridge Sampling with Sequential Monte Carlo as an alternative method for calculating Bayes factors.",

Toomey, Gabriele Montefalcone, Evan McDonough, Katherine Freese Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) have been interpreted to suggest that dark energy may be evolving. In this work, we examine how prior choices affect such conclusions. Specifically, we study the biases introduced by the customary use of uniform priors on the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameters, $w_0$ and $w_a$, when assessing evidence for evolving dark energy. To do so, we construct theory-informed priors on $(w_0, w_a)$ using a normalizing flow (NF), trained on two representative quintessence models, which learns the distribution of these parameters conditional on the underlying $\\Lambda$CDM parameters. In the combined $\\textit{Planck}$ CMB + DESI BAO analysis we find that the apparent tension with a cosmological constant in the CPL framework can be reduced from $\\sim 3.1\\sigma$ to $\\sim 1.3\\sigma$ once theory-informed priors are applied, rendering the result effectively consistent with $\\Lambda$CDM. For completeness, we also analyze combinations that include Type Ia supernova data, showing similar shifts toward the $\\Lambda$CDM limit. Taken together, the observed sensitivity to prior choices in these analyses arises because uniform priors - often mischaracterized as \"uninformative\" - can actually bias inferences toward unphysical parameter regions. Consequently, our results underscore the importance of adopting physically motivated priors to ensure robust cosmological inferences, especially when evaluating new hypotheses with only marginal statistical support. Lastly, our NF-based framework achieves these results by post-processing existing MCMC chains, requiring $\\approx 1$ hour of additional CPU compute time on top of the base analysis - a dramatic speedup over direct model sampling that highlights the scalability of this approach for testing diverse theoretical models.",

Zenteno (DELVE and DES Collaboration) 35 pages, 13 figures, 8 tables; Submitted to AAS Journals Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The properties of Milky Way satellite galaxies have important implications for galaxy formation, reionization, and the fundamental physics of dark matter. However, the population of Milky Way satellites includes the faintest known galaxies, and current observations are incomplete. To understand the impact of observational selection effects on the known satellite population, we perform rigorous, quantitative estimates of the Milky Way satellite galaxy detection efficiency in three wide-field survey datasets: the Dark Energy Survey Year 6, the DECam Local Volume Exploration Data Release 3, and the Pan-STARRS1 Data Release 1. Together, these surveys cover $\\sim$13,600 deg$^2$ to $g \\sim 24.0$ and $\\sim$27,700 deg$^2$ to $g \\sim 22.5$, spanning $\\sim$91% of the high-Galactic-latitude sky ($|b| \\geq 15^\\circ$). We apply multiple detection algorithms over the combined footprint and recover 49 known satellites above a strict census detection threshold. To characterize the sensitivity of our census, we run our detection algorithms on a large set of simulated galaxies injected into the survey data, which allows us to develop models that predict the detectability of satellites as a function of their properties. We then fit an empirical model to our data and infer the luminosity function, radial distribution, and size-luminosity relation of Milky Way satellite galaxies. Our empirical model predicts a total of $265^{+79}_{-47}$ satellite galaxies with $-20 \\leq M_V \\leq 0$, half-light radii of $15 \\leq r_{1/2} (\\rm pc) \\leq 3000$, and galactocentric distances of $10 \\leq D_{\\rm GC} (\\rm kpc) \\leq 300$. We also identify a mild anisotropy in the angular distribution of the observed galaxies, at a significance of $\\sim$$2\\sigma$, which can be attributed to the clustering of satellites associated with the LMC.",

      "abstract": "Predicting stellar collision outcomes of main sequence stars Pau Amaro Seoane Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Stellar collisions in dense galactic nuclei might play an important role in fueling supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and shaping their environments. The gas released during these collisions can contribute to SMBH accretion, influencing phenomena such as active galactic nuclei and tidal disruption events of the remnants. We address the challenge of rapidly and accurately predicting the outcomes of stellar collisionsincluding remnant masses and unbound gasacross a broad parameter space of initial conditions. Existing smoothed-particle-hydrodynamic (SPH) simulation techniques, while detailed, are too resource-intensive for exploratory studies or real-time applications. We develop a machine learning framework trained on a dataset of $\\sim 16,000$ SPH simulations of main-sequence star collisions. By extracting physically meaningful parameters (e.g., masses, radii, impact parameters, and virial ratios) and employing gradient-boosted regression trees with Huber loss, we create a model that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. The method includes logarithmic transforms to handle dynamic ranges and regularization to ensure physical plausibility. The model achieves predictions of collision outcomes (remnant masses, and unbound mass) with very low mean absolute errors respect to the typical mass scale. It operates in fractions of a second, enabling large-scale parameter studies and real-time applications. Parameter importance analysis reveals that the impact parameter and the relative velocity dominate outcomes, aligning with theoretical expectations. Our approach provides a scalable tool for studying stellar collisions in galactic nuclei. The rapid predictions facilitate investigations into gas supply for SMBH accretion and the cumulative effects of collisions over cosmic time, particularly relevant to address the growth of SMBHs.",

Anstey, Eloy de Lera Acedo Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) To achieve the sensitivity required to detect signals from neutral hydrogen from the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionisation it is critical to have a well-calibrated instrument which has a stable calibration over the course of the observation. Previous calibration methods do not explicitly use the time information available and make assumptions on the impedance matching of the reference sources. Here we present a new calibration method based on noise wave parameters which fits a calibration solution over time and frequency to the data, interpolating the solutions to the times at which the antenna is being measured. To test this method we simulate a dataset using measurements of the REACH receiver, modelling a low noise amplifier which is drifting over time. Fitting a polynomial surface in frequency and time to the simulated data demonstrates that we can remove the drift in the calibrated solution over time but leaves a chromatic residual. We further show that we can remove assumptions on the reflection coefficients of the reference noise source and the cold load, reducing degeneracies in the parameter fits. Applying this new calibration equation and surface fitting method to the simulated data removes the chromatic residual in the calibrated spectrum and recovers the parameters to within 0.06% of the truth and a 97% reduction in the RMSE of the spectrum of the validation source compared with previous calibration methods. For two parameters we report up to six times smaller fit error after the degeneracies are removed from the time-based calibration.",

Zou 15 Pages, 11 figures, 2 tables, Submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The Vera C. Rubin Observatory LSST is expected to discover tens of millions of new Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). The survey's exceptional cadence and sensitivity will enable UV/optical/NIR monitoring of a significant fraction of these objects. The unprecedented number of sources makes spectroscopic follow-up for the vast majority of them unfeasible in the near future, so most studies will have to rely on photometric redshifts estimates which are traditionally much less reliable for AGN than for inactive galaxies. This work presents a novel methodology to constrain the photometric redshift of AGNs that leverages the effects of cosmological time dilation, and of the luminosity and wavelength dependence of AGN variability. Specifically, we assume that the variability can be modeled as a damped random walk (DRW) process, and adopt a parametric model to characterize the DRW timescale ($\\tau$) and asymptotic amplitude of the variability (SF$_\\infty$) based on the redshift, the rest-frame wavelength, and the AGN luminosity. We construct variability-based photo-$z$ priors by modeling the observed variability using the expected DRW parameters at a given redshift. These variability-based photometric redshift (VAR-PZ) priors are then combined with traditional SED fitting to improve the redshift estimates from SED fitting. Validation is performed using observational data from the SDSS, demonstrating significant reduction in catastrophic outliers by more than 10% in comparison with SED fitting techniques and improvements in redshift precision. The simulated light curves with both SDSS and LSST-like cadences and baselines confirm that, VAR-PZ will be able to constrain the photometric redshifts of SDSS-like AGNs by bringing the outlier fractions down to below 7% from 32% (SED-alone) at the end of the survey.",

Utilising the halo model, we estimated the statistical properties of matter and biased tracer fields, incorporating all Gaussian, non-Gaussian, and super-sample covariance terms. The flexible configuration permits user-specific parameters, such as the complexity of survey geometry, the halo occupation distribution employed to define each galaxy sample, or the form of the real-space and/or Fourier space statistics to be analysed. We illustrate the capabilities of OneCovariance within the context of a cosmic shear analysis of the final data release of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-Legacy). Upon comparing our estimated covariance with measurements from mock data and calculations from independent software, we ascertain that OneCovariance achieves accuracy at the per cent level. When assessing the impact of ignoring complex survey geometry in the cosmic shear covariance computation, we discover misestimations at approximately the $10\\%$ level for cosmic variance terms. Nonetheless, these discrepancies do not significantly affect the KiDS-Legacy recovery of cosmological parameters. We derive the cross-covariance between real-space correlation functions, bandpowers, and COSEBIs, facilitating future consistency tests among these three cosmic shear statistics. Additionally, we calculate the covariance matrix of photometric-spectroscopic galaxy clustering measurements, validating the jackknife covariance estimates for calibrating KiDS-Legacy redshift distributions. The OneCovariance can be found on GitHub, together with comprehensive documentation and examples.",

All figures and values have been updated with the new results Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) A number of important cosmological questions can be addressed only by probing perturbation modes on the largest accessible scales. One promising probe of these modes is the Kamionkowski-Loeb effect, i.e., the polarization induced in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by Thomson scattering in galaxy clusters, which is proportional to the CMB quadrupole measured at the cluster's location and look-back time. We develop a Fisher formalism for assessing the amount of new information that can be obtained from a future remote quadrupole survey. To demonstrate the constraining power of such a survey, we apply our formalism to a model that suppresses the primordial power spectrum on large scales but is poorly constrained with existing CMB data. We find that the constraints can be improved by over $3\\sigma$ for a survey that measures around 100 clusters over $20\\%$ of the sky with a signal-to-noise ratio of $3$. In the most optimistic case with a low-noise survey with dense full-sky coverage and only a single degree of freedom in the theory, the constraint improves to over $7\\sigma$ beyond local CMB data. Our formalism, which is based in real space rather than harmonic space, can be used to explore a wide range of survey designs, and our results paint an optimistic picture for the utility of remote quadrupole measurements to probe physics on the largest observable scales in the Universe.",

Melchiorri 36 pages, 9 figures; discussion expanded, results updated and references added; matches the version published in JHEAP at this https URL Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We propose a new method that reveal the nature of dark energy (DE) evolution. Specifically, the method consists of studying the evolving trend regarding the effective running Hubble constant: when it increases, it indicates a quintessence nature, and when it decreases, it reveals a phantom behavior. Within the framework of the dark energy models we analyze three parameterizations: the $w$CDM model, a reduced Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model and a new theoretical model based on the possible creation of dark energy by the time-varying gravitational field of the expanding Universe. For each DE model, we construct a theoretical effective running Hubble constant, i.e. a function of the redshift, which highlights the difference between modified dynamics and the $\\Lambda$CDM-one. Furthermore, these dark energy models are compared to the phenomenological model of a decreasing trend of the Hubble constant as a function of the redshift, called the power-law model (PL) and the $\\Lambda$CDM one. These three theoretical functions are fitted against the binned SNe Ia data samples, i.e. the Pantheon and the Master samples, the latter being a collection of SNe Ia from 4 catalogs: Dark Energy Survey (DES), PantheonPlus, Pantheon and Joint Lightcurve Analysis (JLA), without duplicated SNe Ia, called the Master sample. The main result of our study is that the phenomenological PL model is statistically favored compared to the other proposed scenarios, both for the Pantheon and the Master samples. At this stage, the SNe Ia data do not indicate that the evolution of dark energy models among the studied ones is favored respect to the $\\Lambda$CDM. Nevertheless, the binned Pantheon sample allows for a discrimination of the nature of dark energy at least at the $1\\,\\sigma$ level via the fit of the effective running Hubble constant.",

By combining WL measurements with data from external tracers of the gas around massive structures, it is possible to calibrate baryonic effects and, therefore, obtain more precise cosmological constraints. In this study, we generate mock data for a Stage-IV weak lensing survey such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), X-ray gas fractions, and stacked kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) measurements, to jointly constrain cosmological and astrophysical parameters describing baryonic effects (using the Baryon Correction Model - BCM). First, using WL data alone, we quantify the level to which the BCM parameters will need to be constrained to recover the cosmological constraints obtained under the assumption of perfect knowledge of baryonic feedback. We identify the most relevant baryonic parameters and determine that they must be calibrated to a precision of $\\sim 10$-$20\\%$ to avoid significant degradation of the fiducial WL constraints. We forecast that long-term X-ray data from $\\sim 5000$ clusters should be able to reach this threshold for the parameters that characterise the abundance of hot virialised gas. Constraining the distribution of ejected gas presents a greater challenge, however, but we forecast that long-term kSZ data from a CMB-S4-like experiment should achieve the level of precision required for full self-calibration.",

Stepman 24 pages, 13 figures, 8 tables, submitted to A&A, changed affiliations, added acknowledgement Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We select galaxy cluster candidates from the high-redshift (BEST_Z > 0.9) end of the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) galaxy cluster catalogue, for which we obtain moderately deep J-band imaging data with the OMEGA2000 camera at the 3.5m telescope of the Calar Alto Observatory. We include J-band data of four additional targets obtained with the three-channel camera at the 2m Fraunhofer telescope at the Wendelstein Observatory. We complement the new J-band photometric catalogue with forced photometry in the i- and z-bands of the tenth data release of the Legacy Survey (LSDR10) to derive the radial colour distribution around the eRASS1 clusters. Without assuming a priori to find a cluster red sequence at a specific colour, we try to find a radially weighted colour over-density to confirm the presence of high-redshift optical counterparts for the X-ray emission. We compare our confirmation with optical properties derived in earlier works based on LSDR10 data to refine the existing high-redshift cluster confirmation of eROSITA-selected clusters. We attempt to calibrate the colour-redshift-relation including the new J-band data by comparing our obtained photometric redshift estimate with the spectroscopic redshift of a confirmed, optically selected, high-redshift galaxy cluster. We confirm 9 out of 18 of the selected galaxy cluster candidates with a radial over-density of similar coloured galaxies for which we provide a photometric redshift estimate. We can report an increase in the relative colour measurement precision from 8% to 4% when including J-band data. In conclusion, our findings indicate a not insignificant spurious contaminant fraction at the high-redshift end (BEST_Z > 0.9) of the eROSITA/eRASS1 galaxy cluster catalogue, as well as it underlines the necessity for wide and deep near infrared imaging data for confirmation and characterisation of high-$z$ galaxy clusters.",

In this paper, we use the Illustris, IllustrisTNG100, and IllustrisTNG300 simulations to compare how different stellar aperture masses trace halo mass. For massive central galaxies ($M_\\star\\geq 10^{11.2}M_\\odot$), we find that a 2D outskirt stellar mass measured between 50 to 100 kpc ($M_{\\star,[50,100]}$) consistently outperforms other aperture-based stellar masses. We further show that $M_{\\star,[50,100]}$ correlates better with halo mass than the total amount of accreted stars (the ex situ mass), which suggests that not all accreted stars connect to halo assembly equally. While the galaxy formation recipes are different between Illustris and IllustrisTNG100, the two simulations yield consistent ex situ outskirt fractions for massive galaxies (about 70% in $M_{\\star,[50,100]}$). These results demonstrate the potential of using the outskirt stellar mass to deepen our understanding of galaxy-halo connection in massive dark matter halos and trace dark matter halos better.",

Ravi 16 pages, 11 figures, submitted to ApJ, referee report received, will update after revisions High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Hydrogen-rich supernovae (SNe) span a range of hydrogen envelope masses at core collapse, producing diverse light curves from extended plateaus in Type II SNe to double-peaked Type IIb SNe. Recent hydrodynamic modeling predicts a continuous sequence of light-curve morphologies as hydrogen is removed, with short plateau SNe (plateau durations ~50--70 days) emerging as a transitional class. However, the observational boundary between IIb and short-plateau remains poorly defined, and thus far unobserved. We report on extensive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of SN 2023wdd and SN 2022acrv, candidate transitional events on the low-mass end of the short-plateau class. Both exhibit weak, double-peaked light curves which we interpret as exceptionally short plateaus (10--20 days), and hybrid spectral features: persistent H$\\alpha$ absorption with He I contamination, but without the helium dominance characteristic of IIb SNe. Using analytic shock-cooling models and numerical light curve fitting, we estimate hydrogen-rich envelope masses of ~0.6--0.8 $M_\\odot$ -- significantly larger than canonical IIb values ($\\lesssim0.1\\,M_\\odot$) but consistent with the ${\\sim}0.9\\,M_\\odot$ threshold predicted for short-plateau behavior. Although the progenitor radii inferred from analytic and numerical methods differ by factors of 2--5, envelope mass estimates are consistent across approaches. Comparisons to well-studied IIb (SN 2016gkg, SN 2022hnt), short-plateau (SN 2023ufx, SN 2006ai, SN 2016egz, SN 2006Y), and II SNe (SN 2023ixf, SN 2013ej) suggest a monotonic relationship between hydrogen envelope mass and plateau length consistent with analytic and numerical expectations. These findings provide additional evidence for a continuous distribution of envelope stripping in hydrogen-rich core-collapse progenitors and place SN 2023wdd and SN 2022acrv along the IIb/short-plateau boundary.",

      "abstract": "The Photospheric Emission of a Short-Duration Gamma-Ray Burst Emerging from a Realistic Binary Neutron Star Merger Nathan Walker, Davide Lazzati, Tyler Parsotan, Rosalba Perna High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The almost simultaneous detection of GRB170817A and GW170817 ushered in nearly a decade of interest in binary neutron star mergers and their multi-messenger signals, resulting in a greater understanding of the processes that produce short-duration gamma-ray bursts and gravitational waves. However, open questions remain regarding the emission mechanism of these bursts. In this work we present results from the first study of an electromagnetic signal produced from a realistic treatment of a binary neutron star merger, both for on-axis and off-axis observations. We accomplish this by using the PLUTO hydrodynamical code to inject a relativistic jet into the ejecta of a realistic binary neutron star merger, which was itself obtained from the simulation of a 3D BNS merger. Then, we model the prompt photospheric emission that would emerge from this jet using the MCRaT radiative transfer code. We find that the resulting photon spectra can peak around ~1 MeV for on-axis emission and falls off noticeably for off-axis observations. We also find distinctly non-thermal low and high-energy tails in multiple observations, ranging from shallow to mid-off axis observations. Our on-axis results are consistent with the Amati Correlation for short bursts, with some strain evident at higher observing angles. Finally, we find that the radiative efficiency is much lower than seen in previous studies of the photospheric emission of long-duration gamma-ray bursts.",

In this work, we present a systematic analysis of profile stabilization timescales in MSPs using a direct method based on pulse stacking, applied to long-term multi-epoch observations. Our study utilizes data from the upgraded GMRT (uGMRT) between 300--750 MHz for nine MSPs over 3--5 years and Parkes Ultra-Wideband low-frequency receiver observations (Parkes UWL; covering 704--4032 MHz) for three of them. We find that stable profiles typically require averaging over $10^{5}$--$10^{6}$ pulses. This is the first time such a quantitative approach has been applied to MSPs across a wide frequency range, providing an indirect but practical estimate of jitter noise, a dominant noise source in PTA datasets. We observe that stabilization timescales depend on signal-to-noise ratio, pulse morphology, and surface magnetic field strength, with a moderate correlation indicating a possible role of the magnetic field in emission stability. A complementary single-epoch analysis of nine bright MSPs with uGMRT Band-3 (300--500 MHz) reinforces these results and demonstrates the method's applicability to broader MSP populations. We show that a strong correlation exists between profile-stability slope and the jitter parameter, implying that for faint MSPs, profile-stability analysis can act as an effective proxy for intrinsic pulse-shape variability. Our work provides a novel and scalable framework to assess intrinsic profile variability, helping to guide integration time choices and reduce timing noise in PTA experiments.",

The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is a next-generation ground-based gamma-ray facility, sensitive to energies from 20~GeV to 300~TeV. In this work, we present for the first time a performance study of CTAO based on joint simulations of steady-state sources emitting both neutrinos and gamma rays, under the assumption that neutrino events are detected by the KM3NeT telescope in the Northern Hemisphere. To identify potentially observable sources, we apply a neutrino-based selection filter according to KM3NeT's discovery potential. We then simulate gamma-ray detectability with CTAO, taking into account visibility, sensitivity, and extragalactic background light absorption. The analysis is specifically focused on exploring the detectability of sources at low neutrino luminosities, limited to values below $10^{52}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,yr^{-1}}$, in order to assess the performance of CTAO and KM3NeT in identifying faint extragalactic emitters. Particular attention is given to the strategic role of KM3NeT's geographic location, which provides access to Southern-sky sources, and to the impact of the planned CTA+ upgrade, which will enhance CTAO-South with Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs). Our results highlight the importance of coordinated multi-messenger strategies between KM3NeT and CTAO to maximize the discovery potential of astrophysical neutrino sources.",

Upper limits of the luminosity measurements were included in the analysis by using the Kaplan-Meier estimator method. It is found that the high-z quasars exhibit X-ray variability on both short-term (hours-to-days) and intermediate-term (weeks-to-months) timescales, with short-term variability dominating the overall variation. A linear correlation exists between the global mean ($\\mu_{\\mathrm{L_{2-10\\,keV}}}$) and standard deviation ($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{L_{2-10\\,keV}}}$) of X-ray luminosities, which is independent of the X-ray photon index and optical-to-X-ray spectral slope. The localized stochastic magnetic reconnection mechanism is strongly favored, which can naturally lead to a scale-invariant power-law energy distribution and satisfactorily explain the correlation. The $\\sigma$-$\\mu$ correlation parallels with the well-documented rms-flux relation of low-z active galactic nuclei (AGNs), implying the magnetic reconnection mechanism could drive short-timescale X-ray variability in both high- and low-z AGNs. The highest-z quasar in our sample, J142952+544717 (z = 6.18), shows a luminosity distribution extending to ${10}^{47}\\ \\rm{erg\\ {s}^{-1}}$ with a not conspicuous median luminosity. On the other hand, J143023+420436 (z = 4.7), which hosts the most relativistic jet among known high-z blazars, is dominated in the high-luminosity regime (${10}^{47}\\ \\rm{erg\\ {s}^{-1}}$ ), making it an ideal target for multi-wavelength follow-up observations. J090630+693030 is found to have a rest-frame period of 182.46 days and J143023+420436 has a period of 16.89 days, both could be explained by the global evolution of plasmoid chains, in which magnetic islands formed during reconnection may merge successively.",

This unique setup allows for simultaneous measurements of low-energy ($\\sim \\rm{GeV}$) and high-energy ($\\gtrsim 400\\,\\rm{GeV}$) muons generated in cosmic-ray air showers. The correlation between these low- and high-energy muons can serve as a valuable tool not only for analyzing cosmic-ray composition but also for tests of hadronic interaction models.

This is achieved by combining analytical descriptions of the electromagnetic and muon lateral distributions.

This dissertation combines Fermi-LAT observations with a time-dependent leptonic PWN model (TIDE) to explore their gamma-ray emission. The model was validated on benchmark PWNe and applied to a systematic LAT search, leading to the discovery of new MeV-GeV candidates and the first population-level characterization. Several sources were modeled in detail, and predictions for potential TeV-emitting PWNe were tested against current and future observatories. Ultra-high-energy gamma-ray sources were also examined, revealing limits of standard leptonic scenarios. Beyond PWNe, stringent upper limits were obtained for the binary pulsar 1A 0535+262, and steady emission was detected from the globular cluster M5.

Jithesh 12 Pages, 8 Figures, Accepted for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society Main Journal High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The primary radiation from thermonuclear X-ray bursts observed in the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) systems can interact with various parts of the binary system. This interaction gives rise to secondary radiation in different wavelength ranges, known as reprocessed emission. In eclipsing LMXBs, the reprocessed emission from the bursts can be examined during eclipses, as the primary emission is blocked and only the reprocessed emission is visible. We searched for bursts during eclipses in the archival RXTE data of the eclipsing LMXBs and found them in EXO 0748-676 and XTE J1710-281. In EXO 0748-676, seven bursts were found to occur near eclipse egress, with their tails extending beyond the eclipse, and one such burst was found for XTE J1710-281. We estimate the reprocessing fraction at orbital phases near eclipse egress by modeling the peculiar eclipse bursts detected in both systems, which have tails extending beyond the eclipses. We observe an increasing trend in reprocessing fraction as these eclipse bursts occur closer to the eclipse egress. We discuss the possibilities of reprocessing in the ablated wind from the companion star, the accretion disc, and the disc wind in EXO 0748-676 and XTE J1710-281. Additionally, we observe two decay components in the bursts in EXO 0748-676, which could suggest a complex composition of the accreting fuel. From the burst rise timescales, we place an upper limit on the size of the reprocessing regions in both EXO 0748-676 and XTE J1710-281, finding it comparable to the size of the respective X-ray binaries.",

Dependency on Mass Ratio and Orbital Period Bhawna Mukhija, Amit Kashi Accepted for publication in PASP Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We run numerical simulations to study high-power wind accretion in a massive binary system during a high mass loss event. The system consists of an evolved primary star with a zero age main sequence mass of $ M_{1} = \\rm 100~M_{\\odot}$ and a hot secondary star with a mass ranging from $ M_{2} = \\rm 30-80~M_{\\odot}$, orbiting in a circular orbits with periods between 455 and 1155 days. We initiate a weak eruption event with mass loss at a rate of $10^{-3}~\\rm {M_{\\odot}}\\rm~yr^{-1}$ for 1.5 years. During this event, a fraction of the mass lost by the primary is accreted onto the secondary, with the accretion rate being dependent on the orbital and stellar parameters. From the set of simulations, we derive an analytical relation describing the dependence of the mass accretion rate on the orbital period and stellar mass ratio. We also identify the transitional orbital period for which Roche lobe overflow begins to dominate over wind accretion. We find that accretion leads to a reduction in the effective temperature of the secondary star. However, the mass average accretion rate we obtain in the simulations is low enough for the secondary to remain in thermal equilibrium and avoid radial expansion.",

AdvCam incorporates cutting-edge Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) and a fully digital readout system, setting new standards for performance and efficiency. The upgraded camera will feature four times more pixels for the same field of view as the existing PMT-based camera, enabling finer image resolution and significantly improving angular precision and background noise rejection. To cope with the increase in number of pixels, many technological challenges are being tackled, from low power and high speed integrated chip design to real-time data processing on hardware accelerators. This technological leap will lower the energy threshold by allowing operation at lower observation threshold and providing brighter images. The increase in effective area, angular and energy resolution will enhance the sensitivity, unlocking new potential for gamma-ray astronomy. In this work, we present the performance of the AdvCam's core building blocks and its innovative architecture capable of enabling unprecedented triggering capabilities. We also showcase the latest performance results based on Monte-Carlo data that has been tuned to reflect the latest stages of the on-going technological developments, highlighting the transformative capabilities of this next-generation instrument.",

Ramsbottom Accepted Manuscript (published in June 2025 @ this https URL) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) The Axelrod approximation is widely used in astrophysical modelling codes to evaluate electron-impact excitation effective collision strengths for forbidden transitions. Approximate methods such as this are a necessity for many heavy elements with open shells where collisional data is either non existent or sparse as the use of more robust methods prove prohibitively expensive. Atomic data for such forbidden transitions are essential for producing full collisional radiative models that do not assume Local-Thermodynamic-Equilibrium (LTE). In this short work we repeat the optimization of the simple Axelrod formula for a large number of $R$-matrix data sets, ranging from Fe and Ni to the first r-process peak elements of Sr, Y and Zr, to higher Z systems Te, W, Pt and Au. We show that the approximate treatment of forbidden transitions can be a significant source of inaccuracy in such collisional radiative models. We find a large variance of the optimized coefficients for differing systems and charge states, although some general trends can be seen based on the orbital structure of the ground-state-configurations. These trends could potentially inform better estimates for future calculations for elements where $R$-matrix data is not available.",

Boula 23 pags., 2 tabs., 48 figs., 4 vids. this https URL this https URL this https URL this https URL submitted to A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Recollimation is a phenomenon of particular importance in the dynamic evolution of jets and in the emission of high-energy radiation. Additionally, the full comprehension of this phenomenon provides insights into fundamental properties of jets in the vicinity of the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). Three-dimensional (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations revealed that the jet conditions at recollimation favor the growth of strong instabilities, challenging the traditional view-supported from two-dimensional simulations-of confined jets undergoing a series of recollimation and reflection shocks. To investigate the stability of relativistic jets in AGNs at recollimation sites, we perform a set of long duration three-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic simulations with the state-of-the-art PLUTO code, to focus on the development of hydrodynamical instabilities. We explore the non-linear growth of the instabilities and their effects on the physical jet properties as a function of the initial jet parameters: jet Lorentz factor, temperature, opening angle and jet-environment density-contrast. The parameter space is designed to describe low-power, weakly magnetized jets at small distances from the core (around the parsec scale). All collimating jets we simulated develop instabilities. Recollimation instabilities decelerate the jet, heat it, entrain external material, and move the recollimation point to shorter distances from the core. This is true for both conical and cylindrical jets. The instabilities, that are first triggered by the centrifugal instability, appear to be less disruptive in the case of narrower, denser, more relativistic, and warmer jets. These results provide valuable insights into the complex processes governing AGN jets and could be used to model the properties of low-power, weakly magnetized jetted AGNs.",

Magnetars are among the main contenders. Some sources, the repeaters, produce multiple events but so far generally without the characteristic periodicity that one could associate with the spin of a neutron star. Aims: Assuming that the bursts originate from a magnetar magnetosphere, we aim to fit our geometrical model to the two main repeaters of the CHIME/FRB catalogue, namely FRB 20180814A and FRB 20180916B, and thus characterise the star. Methods: The model can generate dynamic spectra that can be directly compared to FRBs. We applied nested sampling in order to evaluate the main parameters of the model. These parameters being common to all bursts from a given repeater, they were fitted together as a single dataset. Results: We constrained the spin and magnetic parameters of the star, which were encoded into burst spectro-temporal morphologies. We estimate that a very strong toroidal magnetic component together with spin periods of, respectively, $2.3\\_{-0.5}^{+0.5} ~ \\rm s$ and $0.8\\_{-0.2}^{+0.1} ~ \\rm s$ best explain the data. We argue that this points towards young magnetars with super-twisted magnetospheres, and possibly low-field magnetars.",

Ho Accepted for publication in ApJ. Eight figures and six tables High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We performed a comprehensive analysis of flux and color variability in a redshift-matched sample of Seyfert galaxies, comprising 23 gamma-ray-detected narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (gNLS1s), 190 non-gamma-ray-detected narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (ngNLS1s), and 10 gamma-ray-detected broad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (gBLS1s). Utilizing multi-band light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) in g, r, and i bands, along with mid-infrared (MIR) observations in W1 and W2 bands from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we observed that gBLS1s exhibit more significant variability than gNLS1s, while ngNLS1s display minimal variability across both optical and MIR wavelengths. The pronounced variability in gBLS1s may be attributed to a more closely aligned jet relative to the observer's line of sight or their comparatively lower accretion rates. In contrast, the subdued variability in ngNLS1s suggests that their flux changes are primarily driven by accretion disk instabilities. A strong correlation between optical and MIR variability amplitudes across different time scales supports the reprocessing scenario, where accretion disk emission variations are re-emitted by surrounding dust. Furthermore, our long-term color variability analysis revealed both stronger bluer-when-brighter (BWB) and redder-when-brighter (RWB) trends from the current sample, but a stronger RWB in approximately 50%, 49%, and 50% of gNLS1s, ngNLS1s, and gBLS1s, respectively, in the longer side of the optical wavelength, and 55%, 28%, and 30% in the MIR wavelength, strengthen the reprocessing scenario. The prevalent RWB trend observed in both optical and MIR wavelengths from the current sample on the longer time scales is likely associated with accretion disk instabilities.",

We develop a semi-analytical framework in which turbulence is modeled as a stochastic velocity field acting through a modified drag force. We integrate the resulting stochastic differential equations both in Cartesian coordinates and in orbital elements using a linearized perturbative approach, and compare these results with full numerical simulations. Eccentricity and inclination evolve toward steady-state Rayleigh distributions, with variances determined by the local disk properties and the ratio of the gas damping rate to the orbital frequency. The analytical predictions agree well with the numerical simulations. We provide closed-form expressions for the variances in both the fast and slow damping regimes. These results are directly applicable to Monte Carlo population models and can serve as physically motivated initial conditions for hydrodynamical simulations. Turbulent forcing prevents full circularization and alignment of BH orbits in AGN disks, even in the presence of strong gas drag. This has important implications for BH merger and binary formation rates, which are sensitive to the residual eccentricity and inclination. Our results highlight the need to account for turbulence-induced stochastic heating when modeling the dynamical evolution of compact objects in AGN environments.",

Singh, Sujoy Kumar Nath, Mayukh Pahari, Brajesh Kumar, Wei Wang, Hsiang-Kuang Chang, Xiaowei Liu 12 Pages, 7 Figures, 3 Tables; Accepted for Publication in the Astrophysical Journal High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The newly discovered Galactic transient MAXI J1744-294 went into its first X-ray outburst in 2025. We study the spectral properties of this source in the 2-10 keV energy band during this outburst using X-ray data from the XRISM satellite for both of its Resolve and Xtend instruments, taken on March 03, 2025. High-resolution spectroscopy has revealed, for the first time, complex iron line features in this source, corresponding to distinct components of Fe XXV emission and Fe XXVI absorption lines. Such a detailed structure has not been reported in other low-mass X-ray binaries to date, prior to the XRISM era. Our analysis shows that the line complexes arise from two highly ionized plasmas with ionization rate ~ 1000 erg-cm/s with distinct turbulent velocities: one broad (~2513 km/s) from hot gas at the inner accretion disk and one narrow (~153 km/s) scattered by nearby photoionized gas. These results offer new insight into the reprocessing of continuum in stratified media, either in the accretion disk or winds, or both, for XRBs in the soft state. The data are well described by models with spin, mass of the black hole, and accretion disk inclination 0.63-0.70, 5.7-10.1 Solar masses, and 19-24 degrees. The fitted spectral model parameters suggest that the source is in the soft spectral state. The source is situated in a crowded field near the Galactic center, resulting in a large hydrogen column density.",

Zafar Accepted for publication in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offer a powerful window to probe the progenitor systems responsible for the formation of heavy elements through the rapid neutron capture (r-) process, thanks to their exceptional luminosity, which allows them to be observed across vast cosmic distances. GRB 241105A, observed at a redshift of z = 2.681, features a short initial spike (1.5 s) and a prolonged weak emission lasting about 64 s, positioning it as a candidate for a compact binary merger and potentially marking it as the most distant merger-driven GRB observed to date. However, the emerging ambiguity in GRB classification necessitates further investigation into the burst's true nature. Prompt emission analyses, such as hardness ratio, spectral lag, and minimum variability timescales, yield mixed classifications, while machine learning-based clustering places GRB 241105A near both long-duration mergers and collapsar GRBs. We conducted observations using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to search for a potential supernova counterpart. Although no conclusive evidence was found for a supernova, the host galaxy's properties derived from the JWST observations suggest active star formation with low metallicity, and a sub-kpc offset of the afterglow from the host, which appears broadly consistent with a collapsar origin. Nevertheless, a compact binary merger origin cannot be ruled out, as the burst may plausibly arise from a fast progenitor channel. This would have important implications for heavy element enrichment in the early Universe.",

To enable precise spatial cross-identification, we constructed two high-precision catalogs: the updated 4FGL-Xiang-DR2 (DR2) and a supplementary version of the fifth edition of Roma-BZCAT (\\texttt{5BZCAT\\_err}). We then developed and applied a novel four-step analytical pipeline combining cross-matching with the statistical analysis of multi-band flux distributions to identify new Fermi blazars. The analytical pipeline has yielded several key results in the systematic comparison of BZBs and BZQs. We found that among single statistical metrics, kurtosis is the most powerful discriminator (MAD~$>$~1.64). At the overall distribution level, the 1.4~GHz, 843~MHz, 5~GHz, 0.1--2.4~keV, and 0.3--10~keV bands show significant divergence (JSD~$>$~0.3). Building on these findings, our proposed ``Box-Cox$+$TND'' model successfully fits the observed flux distributions between BZBs and BZQs. Applying this entire pipeline, we successfully identified 17 new blazars. The validity of these associations is strongly supported by our multi-wavelength flux model, which confirms that 15 of the 17 candidates are statistically consistent with the known blazar population, falling within the $2\\sigma$ confidence interval. Although the two remaining sources exhibit some statistical deviation in the gamma-ray band, their strong consistency in other wavebands, coupled with high spatial association probabilities, leads us to conclude that their associations are also reliable and should not be readily excluded.",

Man Ho Chan, Chak Man Lee High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Recent measurements made by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) have detected accurate positron flux for energy range 1-1000 GeV. The energy spectrum can be best described by two source terms: the low-energy background diffusion term and an unknown high-energy source term. In this article, we discuss the possibility of the emission of positrons originating from dark matter annihilation in two nearby black hole X-ray binaries A0620-00 and XTE J1118+480. We show that the dark matter density spikes around these two black holes can best produce the observed AMS-02 high-energy positron flux due to dark matter annihilation with rest mass $m_{\\rm DM} \\approx 8000$ GeV via the $W^+W^-$ annihilation channel. This initiates a new proposal to account for the unknown high-energy source term in the AMS-02 positron spectrum.",

Davis, Yan-Fei Jiang, Patrick D. Mullen 37 pages, 25 figures, 3 tables, submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a comprehensive analysis of super-Eddington black hole accretion simulations that solve the GRMHD equations coupled with angle-discretized radiation transport. The simulations span a range of accretion rates, two black hole spins, and two magnetic field topologies, and include resolution studies as well as comparisons with non-radiative models. Super-Eddington accretion flows consistently develop geometrically thick disks supported by radiation pressure, regardless of magnetic field configuration. Radiation generated in the inner disk drives substantial outflows, forming conical funnel regions that limit photon escape and result in very low radiation efficiency. The accretion flows are highly turbulent with thermal energy transport dominated by radiation advection rather than diffusion. Angular momentum is primarily carried outward by Maxwell stress, with turbulent Reynolds stress playing a subdominant role. Both strong and weak jets are produced. Strong jets arise from sufficient net vertical magnetic flux and rapid black hole spin and can effectively evacuate the funnel, enabling radiation to escape through strong geometric beaming. In contrast, weak jets fail to clear the funnel, which becomes obscured by radiation-driven outflows and leads to distinct observational signatures. Spiral structures are observed in the plunging region, behaving like density waves. These super-Eddington models are applicable to a variety of astronomical systems, including ultraluminous X-ray sources, little red dots, and black hole transients.",

Implications for high and low redshift massive black holes David Izquierdo-Villalba, Daniele Spinoso, Marta Volonteri, Monica Colpi, Alberto Sesana, Silvia Bonoli Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Recent studies show that light seeds of black holes, which grow into massive black holes (MBHs) over time, often struggle to remain at the centers of their birthplaces in high-redshift galaxies, limiting their ability to accrete gas and merge with other black holes. In this work, we investigate how off-center formation of the first seeds affects the evolution of the MBH and massive black hole binary (MBHB) populations over cosmic history. To this end, we use the $\\texttt{L-Galaxies}{\\it BH}$ semi-analytical model, which includes multiple seed formation mechanisms, with light Population III remnants being the most significant contributors. To incorporate off-center formation, we modify the model to track the initial seed location, the sinking timescales toward the galactic center, and any growth during this phase. The results indicate that seed formation occurring away from the galactic center has a negligible impact on the MBH population at $z<1$, but causes significant differences at higher redshifts. Particularly, the abundance of $10^5 M_{\\odot}$ MBHs at $z>4$ can be up to 2-10 times smaller compared to a nuclear seed formation model. Quasar luminosity functions with $\\rm L_{bol}>10^{44} \\rm erg/s$ are similarly affected, although they still align with observational constraints. The off-centre formation also alters the galaxy-MBH mass relation. At $z>5$, the amplitude of the relation can be up to 2 dex smaller than in nuclear seed models. These differences fade by $z \\sim 2$ for galaxies $>10^{11} M_{\\odot}$, and by $z=0$ for smaller galaxies. Notably, the overmassive MBH population recently unveiled by JWST is still present in the model, suggesting they can form independently of the seed dynamics. Finally, the merging rate of MBHs within LISA sensitivity band is strongly impacted. Specifically, there is a suppression of events at high-$z$ and an enhancement at low-$z$.",

Newman, Federico Marinacci, Richard S. Ellis, Letizia Bugiani, Matteo Sapori, Eric Giunchi Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The role of interactions and mergers in the rapid quenching of massive galaxies in the early Universe remains uncertain, largely due to the difficulty of directly linking mergers to quenching. Collisional ring galaxies provide a unique opportunity, as their morphology allows precise dating of the interaction, which can then be compared to quenching timescales inferred from star formation histories. We study a gravitationally bound system at $z=1.61$ in the UDS field, composed of a Host galaxy ($M_\\star = 10^{11.4} M_\\odot$) with a collisional ring and an X-ray AGN, and the Bullet galaxy ($M_\\star = 10^{11.2} M_\\odot$), located at a projected distance of $\\sim 8$ kpc. Combining JWST and HST imaging with Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy, we find compelling evidence for an ongoing starburst in the Host concurrent with rapid quenching in the Bullet. The ring, $\\sim 20$ kpc in diameter, is expanding at $127^{+72}_{-29}$ km s$^{-1}$, implying the galaxies first collided 47--96 Myr ago. This timeline is consistent with the Host's current starburst and the Bullet's sudden quenching, strongly suggesting both phenomena were triggered by the interaction. Crucially, the Bullet shows no evidence of a preceding starburst, ruling out rapid gas consumption as the primary quenching channel. Instead, we suggest that merger-driven processes -- such as enhanced turbulence and disk instabilities -- may have suppressed star formation. An additional possibility, which we term the ``Dragon Effect,'' is that AGN-driven outflows from the Host disrupted the Bullet's low-density molecular gas, thereby preventing efficient star formation and accelerating quenching.",

Ho 17 Pages, 8 Figures, submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate the X-shaped radio galaxies (XRGs) with optical double-peaked narrow emission (DPNEL) as potential hosts of dual or binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Using a sample of 187 XRGs selected from SDSS and DESI optical spectroscopic surveys, we check the AGN nature of both emission components using the BPT diagnostics of multiple emission lines, namely {[O III]$\\lambda\\lambda$4959,5007}, H$\\alpha$, {[N II]$\\lambda\\lambda$6548,6584}, {[S II]$\\lambda\\lambda$6716,6731}, and H$\\beta$, and mid-infrared colors. We find that the detection rate of [O III] DPNEL features in XRGs is 30% compared to just 1% in the general galaxy population (mostly radio quiet). The dual AGN fraction in DPNEL galaxies is found to depend strongly on the radio luminosity, increasing from $\\sim$25% for radio-undetected to $\\sim$58% in the radio-detected sample of general DPNEL galaxies. In contrast, the DPNEL XRGs and FR-II radio galaxies having higher radio power show a $\\sim$95% likelihood of hosting a dual AGN. Secondly, the detection of companion galaxies in more than 30% of DPNEL XRGs suggests a vital role of mergers in the XRG formation. We also investigate the parsec-scale radio structure of the nuclei of several XRGs using Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) maps at 1.4 GHz, 4.3 GHz or 7.6 GHz and find a resolved core for only one of the XRGs. However, the flat spectral indices of the VLBA cores along with the DPNEL components exhibiting AGN characteristics, together with the detection of radio-optical offsets between the VLBA and Gaia position, are strongly indicative of XRGs being likely candidates for hosting dual/binary AGNs.",

Price, Katherine A. Suess, Arjen van der Wel, Jesse van de Sande, Pieter G. van Dokkum, Daniel R. Weisz 13 pages, 6 figures (excluding appendices); submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Spatially resolved stellar populations of massive, quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon provide powerful insights into star-formation quenching and stellar mass assembly mechanisms. Previous photometric work has revealed that the cores of these galaxies are redder than their outskirts. However, spectroscopy is needed to break the age-metallicity degeneracy and uncover the driver of these colour gradients. Here, we derive age and elemental abundance gradients for 8 distant ($1.2 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 2.2$), massive ($10.3\\lesssim\\log({\\rm M}_*/{\\rm M}_\\odot)\\lesssim 11.1$), quiescent galaxies, by fitting full-spectrum models to ultra-deep NIRSpec-MSA spectroscopy from the JWST-SUSPENSE survey. We find that these galaxies have negative age, positive [Mg/H] and [Mg/Fe], and flat [Fe/H] gradients, implying that galaxy cores are older and Mg-deficient compared to galaxy outskirts. The age gradients indicate inside-out quenching, while the Mg-deficient cores suggest rapid gas expulsion as the central quenching mechanism. Thus, galaxy cores formed faster and quenched more efficiently than their outskirts. In this scenario, however, our [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] gradients are still puzzling. Our results contrast lower-redshift studies, which find flat age and [Mg/Fe] gradients and negative metallicity gradients. Additionally, we find a positive trend between age gradients and rotational support, and marginal trends between gradients and galaxy velocity dispersions and ages. We discuss our findings in the context of galaxy growth scenarios, including minor mergers and progenitor bias, and the possible occurrence of different quenching mechanisms across redshift. With this work, we present the first stellar population gradients from NIRSpec-MSA spectroscopy, in the largest current sample of distant, quiescent galaxies.",

Comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Recent Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) results provided strong evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (sGWB), consistent with a population of merging massive black holes (MBHs) at $z<1$. Meanwhile, JWST observations at $z>5$ suggest a higher number density of accreting MBHs than previously estimated. Together with constraints from local MBHs and high-$z$ quasars, these findings offer a unique opportunity to test MBH seeding and early growth models. We explore this using ${\\tt L-Galaxies}\\textit{BH}$, a new extension of the galaxy formation model ${\\tt L-Galaxies}$, developed to explicitly model all stages of MBH evolution, including seeding, accretion, and binary dynamics. To take advantage of both the high resolution of the ${\\tt MillenniumII}$ and the large volume of the ${\\tt Millennium}$ simulations, we run ${\\tt L-Galaxies}\\textit{BH}$ on the former and use its outputs as initial conditions for the latter, via our $\\textit{grafting}$ method. We find that reproducing the number density of high-$z$ active MBHs observed by JWST requires either a heavy seed formation rate significantly higher than that predicted by current models ($\\gtrsim 0.01 Mpc^{-3}$ at $z \\sim 10$), or widespread formation of light seeds undergoing multiple phases of super-Eddington accretion. Furthermore, matching the amplitude of the PTA sGWB signal requires nearly all galaxies with stellar masses $M_{*}> 10^9 M_\\odot$ to host central MBHs by $z\\sim0$. Given the extreme heavy seed densities required to satisfy both PTA and JWST constraints, our results favor a scenario in which MBHs originate from light seeds that grow rapidly and efficiently in the early universe. This work demonstrates the power of combining multi-messenger data with physical models to probe the origins and evolution of MBHs across cosmic time.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We present Py2DJPAS, a Python-based tool to automate the analysis of spatially resolved galaxies in the \\textbf{miniJPAS} survey, a 1~deg$^2$ precursor of the J-PAS survey, using the same filter system, telescope, and Pathfinder camera. Py2DJPAS streamlines the entire workflow: downloading scientific images and catalogs, performing PSF homogenization, masking, aperture definition, SED fitting, and estimating optical emission line equivalent widths via an artificial neural network. We validate Py2DJPAS on a sample of resolved miniJPAS galaxies, recovering magnitudes in all bands consistent with the catalog ($\\sim 10$~\\% precision using SExtractor). Local background estimation improves results for faint galaxies and apertures. PSF homogenization enables consistent multi-band photometry in inner apertures, allowing pseudo-spectra generation without artifacts. SED fitting across annular apertures yields residuals $<10$~\\%, with no significant wavelength-dependent bias for regions with $S/N>5$. We demonstrate the IFU-like capability of J-PAS by analyzing the spatially resolved properties of galaxy 2470-10239 at $z = 0.078$, comparing them to MaNGA data within 1 half-light radius (HLR). We find excellent agreement in photometric vs. spectroscopic measurements and stellar mass surface density profiles. Our analysis extends to 4 HLR (S/N~$\\sim$~5), showing that J-PAS can probe galaxy outskirts, enabling the study of evolutionary processes at large galactocentric distances.",

These shocked molecular clouds, with an angular distance of about 0.4-0.5 degree toward the Crab Nebula, are located at the shell of a bubble discovered in the GALFA-HI (and HI4PI) images at the same velocity range. The dimension of the bubble is roughly 2.3$\\times$2.6 degree and the expansion velocity is about 5 km/s. The kinetic energy referred from the shocked molecular clouds (roughly 3.5$\\times$10$^{51}$ erg), together with the HI bubble, support the picture that the Crab Nebula belongs to a typical core-collapse supernova remnant. Nevertheless, due to the large uncertainty in the distance measurement, further observations are needed to verify the physical association between the shocked molecular clouds and the Crab Nebula.",

Kobayashi, Noriko Y. Yamasaki, Kosuke Sato 18 pages, 22 figures, submitted to Publcations of the Astronomical Society of Japan Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The thermodynamic properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) at the outskirts of galaxy clusters provide valuable insights into the growth of the dark matter halo and the heating of the ICM. Considering the results of the soft X-ray background study of non-cluster Suzaku fields, we revisit 65 Suzaku pointing observations of the Perseus cluster in eight azimuthal directions beyond 1 Mpc (0.8 $r_{500}$). A possible foreground component, whose spectrum is modeled as a 1 keV collisional ionization equilibrium plasma, significantly affects the temperature and density measurements of the ICM in cluster outskirts. The emission measures in the six arms are similar, showing that the radial slopes of temperature and density follow $r^{-0.67\\pm0.25}$ and $r^{-2.21\\pm 0.06}$, respectively. The radial pressure profile is close to the average profile measured by the Planck satellite. The resulting entropy slope is $\\propto r^{0.81\\pm 0.25}$, consistent with the theoretical slope of 1.1. The integrated gas fraction, the ratio of the integrated gas mass to the hydrostatic mass, is estimated to be 0.13$\\pm$0.01 and 0.18$\\pm$0.02 at $r_{500}$ and $r_{200}$, respectively, consistent with the cosmic baryon fraction. These results suggest that the ICM at the cluster outskirts is quite regular and close to hydrostatic equilibrium. The remaining two arms show that the emission measure is higher by a factor of 1.5-2, possibly due to accretion from filaments from the large-scale structure. A sudden drop in the emission measure also occurs in a direction toward one of the filaments.",

The radiation field consisting of hydrogen recombination lines and continuum emission might significantly affect the hydrogen-level populations in ultra- and hypercompact (U/HC) H II regions. The escape probability approximation was used to estimate the effect of the radiation field in previous models for calculating hydrogen-level populations. The reliability of this approximation has not been systematically studied, however. Aims. We investigate the appropriate ranges of previous models with the escape probability approximation and without the effects of the radiation field. We create a new model for simulating the integrated characteristics and the spatially resolved diagnostics of the hydrogen recombination lines throughout H II regions. Methods. We developed a new nl model with a full radiative transfer treatment of the radiation field causd by hydrogen recombination lines and continuum emission to calculate the hydrogen-level populations and hydrogen recombination lines. We then compared the level populations and the corresponding hydrogen recombination line intensities simulated by the new model and previous models. Results. We studied the applicability and the valid parameter ranges of previous models. Radiation fields exhibit negligible effects on the level populations in classical and UC H II regions. With the modified escape probability, the model with the escape probability approximation is suitable for most HC H II regions. The improved new model performs better in the HC H II region with an extremely high emission measure. To address the high computational costs inherent in numerical models, we trained a precise machine-learning model to enable a rapid estimation of hydrogen-level populations and the associated hydrogen recombination lines.",

Solar 10 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables, submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a new determination of the evolving far-infrared galaxy luminosity function (FIR LF) and the resulting inferred evolution of dust-obscured star-formation rate density (SFRD) out to redshift z~6. To establish the evolving co-moving number density of FIR-bright objects, we make use of the high-resolution ALMA follow-up study (AS2UDS), of the JCMT SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey (S2CLS) sub-mm imaging in the UKIDSS UDS survey field. In order to estimate the contributions of faint/low-mass sources we implement a method in which the faint-end of the IR LF is inferred by stacking (in stellar mass and redshift bins) the optical/near-infrared samples of star-forming galaxies into the appropriate FIR Herschel and sub-mm JCMT maps. Using this information we determine the faint-end slope of the FIR LF in two intermediate redshift bins (where it can be robustly established) and then adopt this result at all other redshifts. The evolution of the characteristic luminosity of the galaxy FIR LF, L*, is found to be increase monotonically with redshift, evolving as z^1.38+-0.07, while the characteristic number density is well fitted by double power-law function, constant at z<2.24 and declining as z^-4.95+-0.73 at higher redshifts. The evolution of the corresponding dust-obscured star-formation rate density was then calculated and is here compared with the results from a number of recent studies in the literature. Our analysis confirms that dust-obscured star-formation activity dominates SFRD at cosmic noon, but then becomes progressively less important with increasing redshift: while dusty star-forming galaxies are still found out to the highest redshifts explored here, UV-visible star formation dominates at z>4, and dust-obscured activity contributes <25% of SFRD by z~6.",

      "abstract": "Evolution of low surface brightness ultra-thin galaxies: The role of dark matter halo and bar formation on disk thickness K. Aditya, Arunima Banerjee Accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate how stellar disks sustain their ultrathin structure throughout their evolution. We follow the evolution of ultrathin stellar disks with varying dark matter (DM) halo concentration ($c$) using collisionless $N$-body simulations with \\texttt{AREPO}. We test models embedded in steep ($c = 12$), shallow ($c = 2$), and intermediate ($c = 6$) DM concentrations. Our models match the observed structural properties of the stellar disk in the low surface brightness (LSB) ultrathin galaxy FGC~2366, specifically its surface brightness, disk scalelength, and vertical thinness ($h_{z}/R_{D} = 0.1$), while excluding gas, allowing us to isolate the effects of DM. The internal disk heating mechanism driven by bars is suppressed in the LSB ultrathin stellar disks regardless of the DM concentration. The ratio of disk thickness ($h_z$) to scalelength ($R_D$) remains constant at $\\leq 0.1$ throughout their evolution. To clearly establish that the LSB nature of stellar disks is the key to preventing disk thickening, we construct the initial conditions by increasing the stellar mass fraction from $f_{s} \\sim 0.01$ to $0.02$ and $0.04$, respectively, while keeping the total mass equal to $10^{11} M_\\odot$ and $h_z/R_D \\leq 0.1$ unchanged. We find that models with a higher stellar mass fraction embedded in a shallow DM potential ($c = 2$) form bars and undergo significant disk thickening ($h_{z}/R_{D} \\gg 0.1$) concurrent with the bar growth. We conclude that if the LSB disks are thin to begin with, they remain so throughout their evolution in isolation, regardless of the concentration of the DM halo.",

Garrod Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph) In cold, dense astrophysical environments dust grains are mixed with molecular ices. Chemistry in those dust/ice mixtures is determined by diffusion and reaction of molecules and radicals. However, investigations of diffusion of astrophysically relevant radicals and molecules across the surface and through the pores of cosmic dust grains and of surface reactions consequent to such diffusion is largely uncharted territory. This paper presents results of a study of a solid-state reaction of two molecular species, CO2 and NH3, separated by a layer of porous silicate grain aggregates, analogues of cosmic dust. The experiments demonstrate that the presence of the dust layer was necessary for a pure thermal CO2 + 2NH3 reaction to proceed, leading to the formation of ammonium carbamate (NH4+NH2COO-), an ionic solid containing a complex organic moiety of prebiotic interest recently detected in a protoplanetary disk. This result speaks for: (i) efficient diffusion of molecules on/within cosmic dust, (ii) an underestimated role for surface catalysis in the astrochemistry of cosmic dust, and (iii) potentially efficient dust-promoted chemistry in warm cosmic environments, such as protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks.",

Accepted for publication in A&A 14 September 2025 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The nature and evolution of hydrocarbonaceous grains within interstellar and circumstellar media is still far from resolved, perhaps owing to the rather complex nature of their seemingly simple binary atomic compositions. This work explores the fine details of amorphous hydrocarbon nanoparticle, a-C(:H), composition and the evolution of the inherent sub-structures under extreme conditions, focusing on the characteristic CH$_n$ bands in the 3-4 micron wavelength region. Particular attention is paid to the role of dehydrogenation and its effects on the sp^3 and sp^2 hybridisations, leading to an extensive conjugated domain functionalisation of the contiguous structural network within a-C(:H) nanoparticles. Qualitatively this approach is able to explain the origin and evolution, including the appearance and disappearance, of emission bands observed in the 3-4 micron wavelength regime without a significant aromatic moiety content within the structures. A diatomic a-C(:H) phase is likely at the heart of the observed dust evolution in the interstellar medium, and circumstellar and photodissociation regions, as observed at short wavelengths. It appears that we have some way to go in fully understanding these complex materials. Much laboratory work will be required in order to elucidate their chemical and structural evolution at nanoparticle sizes under extreme conditions.",

Jahnke Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Local Universe dwarf galaxies are both cosmological and mass assembly probes. Deep surveys have enabled the study of these objects down to the low surface brightness (LSB) regime. In this paper, we estimate Euclid's dwarf detection capabilities as well as limits of its MERge processing function (MER pipeline), responsible for producing the stacked mosaics and final catalogues. To do this, we inject mock dwarf galaxies in a real Euclid Wide Survey (EWS) field in the VIS band and compare the input catalogue to the final MER catalogue. The mock dwarf galaxies are generated with simple Sérsic models and structural parameters extracted from observed dwarf galaxy property catalogues. To characterize the detected dwarfs, we use the mean surface brightness inside the effective radius SBe (in mag arcsec-2). The final MER catalogues achieve completenesses of 91 % for SBe in [21, 24], and 54 % for SBe in [24, 28]. These numbers do not take into account possible contaminants, including confusion with background galaxies at the location of the dwarfs. After taking into account those effects, they become respectively 86 % and 38 %. The MER pipeline performs a final local background subtraction with small mesh size, leading to a flux loss for galaxies with Re > 10\". By using the final MER mosaics and reinjecting this local background, we obtain an image in which we recover reliable photometric properties for objects under the arcminute scale.

Celeste Artale 14 pages, 12 figures, submitted in A&A (after first revision) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Boxy/peanut and X-shaped (BP/X) bulges are prominent features in edge-on disk galaxies and are believed to be vertically thickened bars. Despite their relevance in bar evolution, a statistically robust census of these structures in large surveys has been lacking. We aim to provide the largest catalog of BP/X structures in edge-on galaxies to date, and to investigate their properties and role in shaping galaxy scaling relations. We selected a sample of 6684 edge-on galaxies from SDSS DR8 using Galaxy Zoo classifications, requiring a high edge-on probability ($> 0.9$) and a minimum of 10 independent votes. Two-dimensional image decomposition is performed using GALFIT to obtain structural parameters. Residual images are visually inspected to classify BP/X features into four categories: strong both-sided, both-sided, one-sided, and control (no BP/X). We also estimated stellar mass, distance, and physical size for each galaxy. Out of 6653 classified galaxies, we identified 1675 ($\\sim$25%) with both-sided BP/X features-545 ($\\sim$8%) strong and 1130 ($\\sim$17%) faint-as well as 1108 ($\\sim$17%) one-sided structures, making up a total of 2783 BP/X-hosting galaxies ($\\sim$42%). One-sided structures, likely signatures of ongoing buckling, are more frequent than strong both-sided bulges across all stellar masses. The fraction of BP/X bulges increases with stellar surface mass density, indicating a connection with bar formation in dense disks. We also find that galaxies with strong BP/X bulges contribute to increased scatter in the stellar mass-size and stellar mass-surface density relations, particularly at higher masses.",

All objects, observed in the 1.7-5.3 micron range, show strong hydrogen recombination lines in the Paschen, Brackett, Pfund, and Humphreys series, confirming their very young ages. The spectra of 11 YSOs show prominent absorption bands from the three most important ice species (H2O, CO2, CO), marking the first detection of these ices in intermediate-mass YSOs beyond our Galaxy. In three YSOs, water ice appears to be in crystalline form. In some objects, we also detect 13CO2 and OCS ices -- never before observed beyond the Milky Way (MW) -- and methanol ice in at least one star. We compared the column densities of H2O, CO2, and CO ices with those measured in more and less massive protostars in the MW and Large Magellanic Cloud, finding that in NGC 346 ice column densities reach values nearly an order of magnitude lower than in more massive objects (~1x10^{17} cm-2 for water and ~1x10^{16} cm-2 for CO2 and CO). However, the relative proportions of the ice species abundances do not differ from those in massive MW YSOs. This suggests that metallicity may not significantly affect ice chemistry in protoplanetary discs and that, shielded by the protostellar envelope or deep in the midplane, circumstellar material is likely impervious to the radiation environment.",

Chemical modelling tools are essential for simulating the complex processes that govern molecular evolution. We present SIMBA, a new Python-based single-point astrochemical modelling package designed to solve chemical reaction networks across diverse astrophysical environments. The software follows standardised rate equation approaches to evolve molecular abundances under specified physical conditions, incorporating gas-phase chemistry, grain-surface processes, and photochemistry. While leveraging Python for accessibility, performance-critical routines utilise just-in-time compilation to achieve computational efficiency suitable for research applications. A key feature of SIMBA is its graphical interface, which enables rapid investigation of chemical evolution under varying physical conditions. This makes it particularly valuable for exploring parameter dependencies and complementing more computationally intensive multi-dimensional models. We demonstrate the package's capabilities by modelling chemical evolution in a photoevaporative flow driven by external FUV irradiation. Using simplified gas dynamics, we chain multiple SIMBA instances to create a dynamic 1D model where gas evolves both chemically and dynamically. Comparing this approach to typical static models - where chemistry in each grid cell evolves independently - reveals that molecular ices, especially those with relatively high binding energies like H2O, can survive much farther into the flow than static models predict. This example case highlights how SIMBA can be extended to higher dimensions for investigating complex chemical processes. The package is open-source and includes comprehensive documentation.",

We also find a tidal-circularization period of $14.4^{+0.14}_{-0.11}$ days.

Willcox Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) At high metallicity, a majority of massive stars have at least one close stellar companion. The evolution of such binaries is subject to strong interaction processes, heavily impacting the characteristics of their life-ending supernova and compact remnants. For the low-metallicity environments of high-redshift galaxies constraints on the multiplicity properties of massive stars over the separation range leading to binary interaction are crucially missing. Here we show that the presence of massive stars in close binaries is ubiquitous, even at low metallicity. Using the Very Large Telescope, we obtained multi-epoch radial velocity measurements of a representative sample of 139 massive O-type stars across the Small Magellanic Cloud, which has a metal content of about one fifth of the solar value. We find that 45% of them show radial velocity variations which demonstrate that they are members of close binary systems, and predominantly have orbital periods shorter than one year. Correcting for observational biases indicates that at least 70[+11:-6]% of the O stars in our sample are in close binaries, and that at least 68[+7:-8]% of all O stars interact with a companion star during their lifetime. We found no evidence supporting a statistically significant trend of the multiplicity properties with metallicity. Our results indicate that multiplicity and binary interactions govern the evolution of massive stars and determine their cosmic feedback and explosive fates.",

In this work, we demonstrate that II can also probe internal stellar kinematics by revealing a time-asymmetric Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) effect, causing a measurable shift in the temporal correlation peak away from zero delay. We develop numerical models to simulate this effect for two distinct astrophysical scenarios: an emission-line circumstellar disk and an absorption-line binary system. Our simulations reveal a clear sensitivity of this temporal asymmetry to the system's inclination angle, velocity symmetry, and internal dynamics. This suggests that, with sufficiently high time resolution, II can be used to extract quantitative information about internal kinematics, offering a new observational window on stellar dynamics.",

McMillan Accepted to A&A. 9 pages, 5 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Mass segregation is seen in many star clusters, but whether massive stars form in the center of a cluster or migrate there dynamically is still debated. N-body simulations have shown that early dynamical mass segregation is possible when sub-clusters merge to form a dense core with a small crossing time. However, the effect of gas dynamics on both the formation and dynamics of the stars could inhibit the formation of the dense core. We aim to study the dynamical mass segregation of star cluster models that include gas dynamics and self-consistently form stars from the dense substructure in the gas. Our models use the Torch framework, which is based on AMUSE and includes stellar and magnetized gas dynamics, as well as stellar evolution and feedback from radiation, stellar winds, and supernovae. Our models consist of three star clusters forming from initial turbulent spherical clouds of mass $10^{4,5,6}\\rm~M_\\odot$ and radius $11.7\\rm~pc$ that have final stellar masses of $3.6\\times10^3\\rm~M_\\odot$, $6.5\\times10^4\\rm~M_\\odot$, and $8.9\\times10^5\\rm~M_\\odot$, respectively. There is no primordial mass segregation in the model by construction. All three clusters become dynamically mass segregated at early times via collapse confirming that this mechanism occurs within sub-clusters forming directly out of the dense substructure in the gas. The dynamics of the embedded gas and stellar feedback do not inhibit the collapse of the cluster. We find that each model cluster becomes mass segregated within $2~$Myr of the onset of star formation, reaching the levels observed in young clusters in the Milky Way. However, we note that the exact values are highly time-variable during these early phases of evolution. Massive stars that segregate to the center during core collapse are likely to be dynamically ejected, a process that can decrease the overall level of mass segregation again.",

At $z \\sim 11.5$, Amaryllis closely matches the observed properties of GS-z14-0, including $M_\\star$, SFR, and the luminosity of FIR ([OIII] 88$\\,$um) and UV (e.g. CIII]$\\,1908$) lines. We find that high [OIII]/[CII] ratios appear during short, merger-driven starburst episodes, when low metallicity ($Z \\sim 0.02\\,Z_{\\odot}$) and high ionization conditions ($U_{\\mathrm{ion}} \\sim 0.1$) push the ISM far from equilibrium. These extreme FIR line ratios are thus transient and linked to major mergers that ignite strong ionized gas outflows. Strikingly, despite this dynamical activity, Amaryllis develops a rotation-supported gaseous disk ($V/\\sigma \\sim 4$-6) by $z \\sim 11$, while stars remain dispersion-dominated. This coexistence of ordered gas rotation and merger-driven disturbances occurs within a massive yet typical $\\Lambda$CDM halo, enabling disk formation even at cosmic dawn.",

Klaassen Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series (ApJS). 42 pages, 24 figures, 7 tables Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) In the era of JWST, with its unprecedented sensitivity and spectral resolution, infrared spectral surveys have revealed a rich inventory of ices, including complex organic molecules (COMs), in young stellar objects (YSOs). However, robust methods to decompose and quantify these absorption features particularly across broad spectral ranges, are still under investigation. We present INDRA (Ice-fitting with NNLS-based Decomposition and Retrieval Algorithm), a fully Python-based tool that performs continuum and silicate removal, global ice fitting using Weighted Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS), and estimates column densities and statistical significance. We apply INDRA to NGC 1333 IRAS 2A, a target from the JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS+) program previously studied using local fitting. We derive optical depths via polynomial continuum subtraction and remove silicate absorption using a synthetic model, isolating ice features for global MIRI fitting. Our results are consistent with previous local fits, confirming simple species and COMs, and expand the inventory by identifying additional absorption features from CO2 and NH4+. We also propose the presence of organic refractories contributing up to 9.6% in the spectral region of 5-8 microns among the various ice components, whose inclusion significantly improves the global spectral fitting. These broad absorption features, extending across 5.5-11 microns, are likely produced by large, complex molecules containing carbonyl (C=O), hydroxyl (O-H), amine (N-H), and C-H bending modes. Our expanded inventory, now incorporating these organic residues, offers new insights into the chemical evolution of ices in star-forming regions and highlights the importance of global spectral fitting in constraining ice compositions.",

Carnall, Yanmei Chen Accepted for publication in MNRAS. Main text: 17 pages, 8 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The quenching of star formation in galaxies is an important aspect of galaxy evolution, but the physical mechanisms that drive it are still not understood. Measuring the spatial distribution of quenching can help determine these mechanisms. We present the star-formation histories (SFHs) and stellar metallicity evolution of rapidly quenched regions in 86 local post-starburst (PSB) galaxies from the MaNGA integral field survey, obtained through Bayesian full spectral fitting of their rest-frame optical spectra. We found that regardless of spatial location, the PSB regions have similar past SFHs and chemical evolution, once radial metallicity gradients are accounted for. This suggests that all PSB regions are regulated by a common set of local scale processes in the interstellar medium, regardless of the broader triggering mechanism. We show that the centres of galaxies with outer PSB regions are also quenching. The central specific star-formation rate (sSFR) has declined by $\\sim1.0\\;$dex on average during the last 2 Gyr, a significantly steeper decline than main sequence galaxies over the same period ($\\approx0.2\\;$dex). This central quenching can be either synchronous, outside-in or inside-out, and slower or as fast as the outer regions, highlighting the diversity of quenching pathways for local galaxies. Our results imply a primary quenching mechanism that is both catastrophic and global in rapidly halting star formation in local galaxies. We suggest the predominant cause is galaxy mergers or interactions, with large scale feedback from a starburst or a central supermassive black hole playing a lesser role.",

We measured proper motions (PMs) for six dwarf galaxies located 400-1000 kpc from the MW using the Hubble Space Telescope. For four galaxies (Aquarius, Cetus, Pisces, Tucana), we report the first PMs. For the remaining two (Leo T and Pegasus), we measure PMs with order-of-magnitude improvement. We compute orbital histories to assess whether any of the six are backsplash galaxies. While some have non-zero likelihoods of past interaction with the MW or M31, these are weak and typically occur at large distances (e.g., $>$ 2Rvir). The properties of Aquarius, Leo T, Pisces, and Pegasus are consistent with first passage through a massive halo. Cetus, which shows a low probability (~4-6%) of interacting with the MW or M31 in the last 6 Gyr, is more likely a backsplash galaxy resulting from an interaction with M31 over 6 Gyr ago, in the same regime where rigid orbital models become less reliable. Tucana has been thought to be a backsplash galaxy, but our orbits indicate it cannot have interacted with a massive LG host. Our results highlight the diversity of evolutionary pathways for isolated, intermediate-mass dwarfs ($M_* \\approx 10^5-10^7 M_{\\odot}$) and the need to reassess quenching mechanisms beyond environmental interactions with massive hosts.",

Metcalfe Accepted to ApJL; 8 pages, 3 figures, 1 table Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) For nearly a decade, observations have shown that many older Sun-like stars spin faster than predicted, a phenomenon known as weakened magnetic braking (WMB). The leading hypothesis for WMB is a weakening of the large-scale dipole field, which leads to a less efficient angular momentum loss. To test this hypothesis on a star known to be in the WMB regime, we present the first Zeeman Doppler Imaging (ZDI) map of the Sun-like star $\\tau$Ceti, reconstructed using spectropolarimetric data from the Canada-France-Hawai'i Telescope (CFHT). Our ZDI analysis reveals a remarkably simple, stable and weak ($\\langle B\\rangle =0.17 \\mathrm{G}$) magnetic field, characterized by a predominantly dipolar ($\\sim92\\%$ magnetic energy contained in $l=1$ modes), and highly axisymmetric ($\\sim88\\%$ magnetic energy contained in $m<l/2$ modes) morphology. We infer a dipole field strength of $B_{\\mathrm{dip}}=0.31 \\mathrm{G}$, nearly an order of magnitude weaker than standard braking model predictions, providing direct confirmation of the weakened large-scale dipole predicted by the WMB hypothesis. This work establishes a new benchmark for ZDI, demonstrating that even extremely quiet stars in the WMB regime are accessible to this technique.",

Wong, Gonzalo Holgado, Matteo Cantiello Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) High-resolution spectroscopic measurements of OB stars are important for understanding processes like stellar evolution, but require labor-intensive observations. In contrast, photometric missions like the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) can monitor hundreds of thousands of stars with a range of temporal resolutions, but do not provide such detailed measurements. With surveys like the Legacy Survey of Space and Time promising unprecedented photometric coverage over the next ten years, it is increasingly important to develop methods that connect large-scale time-series photometry with the detailed stellar parameter measurements typically derived from spectroscopy. In this paper, we test whether machine learning can recover such parameters by combining TESS light curves with spectroscopic measurements from the IACOB project, using a sample of 285 light curves from 106 unique O stars. Using both multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate that (1) O star light curves contain sufficient information to meaningfully infer stellar parameters and (2) periodograms derived from light curves capture substantially more information than previously identified correlation parameters. Our best model achieves moderate success in predicting both spectroscopic luminosity ($R^2 = 0.641_{-0.167}^{+0.107}$) and effective temperature ($R^2 = 0.443_{-0.234}^{+0.056}$), key stellar parameters for determining positions of stars on the spectroscopic Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, despite the small dataset size. Further progress will require expanded datasets of matched photometric and spectroscopic observations.",

Finally, we discuss our sample in the context of galactic archaeology and show how ages like these could be used to identify and study binary system evolution and galactic evolution in the future.

Kolaczek-Szymanski, Yael Naze, Lucas Nys Accepted for publication in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The eccentric short-period O-star binary BD+60 497 is an interesting laboratory to study tidal interactions in massive binary systems, notably via the detection and characterisation of apsidal motion. The rate of apsidal motion in such systems can help us constrain their age and gain insight into the degree of mass concentration in the interior of massive stars. Spectroscopic data collected over two decades are used to reconstruct the individual spectra of the stars and to establish their epoch-dependent radial velocities. An orbital solution, explicitly accounting for apsidal motion is adjusted to the data. Space-borne photometric time series are analysed with Fourier methods and with binary models. We derive a rate of apsidal motion of $6.15^{+1.05}_{-1.65}$ degree/yr which suggests an age of $4.13^{+0.42}_{-1.37}$ Myr. The disentangled spectra unveil a curious change in the spectral properties of the secondary star between the epochs 2002-2003 and 2018-2022 with the secondary spectrum appearing of earlier spectral type over recent years. Photometric data show variability at the 6 mmag level on the period of the binary system which is hard to explain in terms of proximity effects. Whilst the rate of apsidal motion agrees well with theoretical expectations, the changes in the reconstructed secondary spectrum hint at a highly non-uniform surface temperature distribution for this star. Different effects are discussed that could contribute to the photometric variations. The currently most-likely explanation is a mix of proximity effects and tidally excited oscillations",

High-resolution spectroscopy confirms orbital periods of 1.37 and 2.67 days with circular orbits.

The absence of detectable spectral features from the companions rules out main-sequence stars of these masses, suggesting that the unseen companions are likely O/Ne or C/O massive white dwarfs.

      "abstract": "Binary imposters: Mergers in massive hierarchical triple stars F. Kummer, G. Simion, S. Toonen, A. de Koter Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Massive stars are often born in triples, where gravitational dynamics and stellar interactions play a crucial role in shaping their evolution. One such pathway includes the merger of the inner binary, transforming the system to a binary with a distinct formation history. Therefore, the interpretation of observed binary properties and their inferred formation history may require the consideration of a potential triple origin. We aim to investigate the population of stellar mergers in massive hierarchical triples. Specifically, we assess how frequently mergers occur, and characterise the properties of the post-merger binaries and their subsequent evolution. We combine the triple population synthesis code TRES, which self-consistently models stellar evolution, binary interaction, and gravitational dynamics, with the binary population synthesis code SeBa to simulate 10^5 dynamically stable, massive triples from the zero-age main sequence through merger and post-merger evolution. We explore the effects of a range of physical models for the initial stellar properties, mass transfer, and merger. We find that stellar mergers are a common outcome, occurring in 20-32% of massive triples. Most mergers happen relatively early in the evolution of the system and involve two main-sequence (MS) stars, producing rejuvenated merger remnants that can appear significantly younger than their tertiary companions. Consequently, we predict that 2-10% of all wide MS+MS binaries (P>100 days) have a measurable age discrepancy, and serve as a promising way to identify merged stars. The post-merger systems preferentially evolve into wide, eccentric binaries, with ~80% avoiding further interaction. However, a notable fraction (16-22%) undergoes a second mass-transfer phase, which may result in the formation of high-mass X-ray binaries or mergers of compact objects that spiral in via gravitational-wave emission.",

CUSP will allow us to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed at developing new CubeSat missions. It is undergoing a 12-month Phase B that started in December 2024. The Compton polarimeter on board CUSP is composed of two acquisition chains based on plastic scintillators read out by Multi-Anode PhotoMultiplier Tubes for the scatterer part and GAGG crystals coupled to Avalanche PhotoDiodes for the absorbers. An event coincident between the two readout schemes will lead to a measurement of the incoming X-ray's azimuthal scattering angle, linked to the polarization of the solar flare in a statistical manner. The current status of the CUSP mission design, mission analysis, and payload scientific performance will be reported. The latter will be discussed based on preliminary laboratory results obtained in parallel with Geant4 simulations.",

Mandal 17 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in the Astronomy & Astrophysics journal on 14 September 2025 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Coronal loops are plasma structures in the solar atmosphere with temperatures reaching millions of Kelvin, shaped and sustained by the magnetic field. However, their morphology and fundamental nature remain subjects of debate. By studying their cross-sectional properties and how they change along the loop and in time, we can understand their magnetic structure and heating mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the cross-sectional intensity profiles, both spatially and temporally, of two unique coronal loops, observed in the periphery of two distinct active regions by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI/HRI$_{\\rm EUV}$) on board the Solar Orbiter spacecraft. The main results of this study are 1. The lifetimes of these two loops (loop1 > 120 min \\& loop2 > 50 min) are longer than the typical timescales of radiative cooling and thermal conduction. 2. Their widths determined by the FWHM of the single Gaussian fit to the cross-axis intensity profiles are greater than 6-7 pixels of EUI/HRI$_{\\rm EUV}$, indicating that the loop cross-section is uniformly filled on well-resolvable scales. 3. These loops exhibited an almost constant width, both spatially and temporally (width for loop1 is 2.1 $\\pm$ 0.4 Mm and for loop2 is 1.3 $\\pm$ 0.2 Mm), indicating that they are stable non-expanding structures. 4. We present observational evidence that the one of the loops (loop2) is not braided, which strongly suggests that the non-expanding nature of this multi-stranded loop along its length cannot be attributed to the twist of the magnetic field lines. In conclusion, we find that these coronal loops are long, stable, multi-stranded, non-expanding structures with a uniform cross-section that persist in the corona for an unusually extended duration. This not only challenges our current understanding of the structure of the coronal magnetic field but also raises critical questions about the mechanisms",

An Architecture-Dependent Mass-Radius Relation Dolev Bashi 7 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS Letters Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Exoplanet demographics increasingly reveal that planetary properties depend not only on local irradiation and composition but also on the wider system architecture. We analyse a sample of Neptune-sized short-period planets with well-measured masses and radii, identifying those whose host stars harbour at least one confirmed outer-giant (OG) companion. On the mass-radius (M-R) plane, the two populations diverge modestly: inner planets in OG systems cluster at systematically larger radii than their counterparts in no-giant (NG) systems, a result that remains suggestive after controlling for planet and stellar properties. Bayesian modelling quantifies the offset, revealing an average radius enhancement of $17 \\pm 4 \\%$ for inner planets in OG systems relative to NG systems at fixed mass. Alternative cuts, including the use of a homogeneous set of parameters, confirm the robustness of the signal, though the result still relies on small-number statistics. Possible mechanisms for the observed inflation include boosted envelope accretion, reduced atmospheric loss, or volatile enrichment by giant-planet stirring. If upheld, this empirical link between outer giants and inflated inner-planet radii offers a new constraint on coupled formation and evolution in planetary systems.",

Nearby binaries provide opportunities to characterize their properties and orbits through a combination of radial velocities, astrometry, and direct imaging. Eta Cassiopeiae is a bright, well-known binary system for which recent observations have provided greatly improved stellar masses and orbital parameters. We present additional radial velocity data that are used to perform an injection-recovery analysis for potential planetary signatures. We further provide a detailed dynamical study that explores the viability of planetary orbits throughout the system. Our combined analysis shows that giant planets are significantly ruled out for the system, and indeed no planetary orbits are viable beyond $\\sim$8 AU of the primary star. However, terrestrial planets may yet exist within the Habitable Zone where orbits can remain long-term stable. We discuss the implications of these results, highlighting the effect of wide binary companions on giant planet formation, and the consequences for occurrence rates and planetary habitability.",

Bake Space Physics (physics.space-ph); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental and omnipresent energy conversion process in plasma physics. Novel observations of fields and particles from Parker Solar Probe (PSP) have shown the absence of reconnection in a large number of current sheets in the near-Sun solar wind. Using near-Sun observations from PSP Encounters 4 to 11 (Jan 2020 to March 2022), we investigate whether reconnection onset might be suppressed by velocity shear. We compare estimates of the tearing mode growth rate in the presence of shear flow for time periods identified as containing reconnecting current sheets versus non-reconnecting times, finding systematically larger growth rates for reconnection periods. Upon examination of the parameters associated with reconnection onset, we find that 85% of the reconnection events are embedded in slow, non-Alfvenic wind streams. We compare with fast, slow non-Alfvenic, and slow Alfvenic streams, finding that the growth rate is suppressed in highly Alfvenic fast and slow wind and reconnection is not seen in these wind types, as would be expected from our theoretical expressions. These wind streams have strong Alfvenic} flow shear, consistent with the idea of reconnection suppression by such flows. This could help explain the frequent absence of reconnection events in the highly Alfvenic, near-Sun solar wind observed by PSP. Finally, we find a steepening of both the trace and magnitude magnetic field spectra within reconnection periods in comparison to ambient wind. We tie this to the dynamics of relatively balanced turbulence within these reconnection periods and the potential generation of compressible fluctuations.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Current models of binary systems often depend on simplified approach of the radiation field, which are unlikely to accurately capture the complexities of asymmetric environments. We investigate the dynamical and chemical implications of a 3D asymmetric radiation field that accounts for the optical properties of sub-structures present in a protoplanetary disk, as well as the inclusion of a secondary radiation source in binary systems. We conducted a series of 3D-SPH hydrodynamical simulations using PHANTOM, coupled with the 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code MCFOST, to compute disc temperatures on-the-fly. We explored different binary-disk orientations (0$^o$ and 30$^o$) for an eccentric binary, along with a constant dust-to-gas ratio and dust as a mixture prescription. We also simulated an outburst event as an example of a drastic increase in luminosity. Heating from the secondary star inflates the outer disk, increasing the aspect ratio facing the companion by about 25% in inclined cases compared to 10% in coplanar ones. Dust settling in the mid-plane enhances extinction along the disk plane, making the coplanar case cooler than the inclined one on the side of the disk facing the companion. Besides, heating causes a shift in the snow line for species with freeze-out temperatures below 50 K, depending on the disk-binary inclination and binary phase. During outbursts, the aspect ratio doubles on the star-facing side and increases by 50% on the opposite side in inclined cases. The snow line shift would impact all the species considered in the outburst case. Disk heating in binaries depends on stellar properties, orbital phase, and disk local and global characteristics. This results in temperature asymmetries, especially during secondary star outbursts, leading to variations in aspect ratio and snow lines that can affect chemistry and planet formation.",

Volume 45, Issue 4: 913 - 942 (2025) Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) The magnetic fields and dynamical processes in the solar polar regions play a crucial role in the solar magnetic cycle and in supplying mass and energy to the fast solar wind, ultimately being vital in controlling solar activities and driving space weather. Despite numerous efforts to explore these regions, to date no imaging observations of the Sun's poles have been achieved from vantage points out of the ecliptic plane, leaving their behavior and evolution poorly understood. This observation gap has left three top-level scientific questions unanswered, 1) How does the solar dynamo work and drive the solar magnetic cycle? 2) What drives the fast solar wind? 3) How do space weather processes globally originate from the Sun and propagate throughout the solar system? The Solar Polar-orbit Observatory (SPO) mission, a solar polar exploration spacecraft, is proposed to address these three unanswered scientific questions by imaging the Sun's poles from high heliolatitudes. In order to achieve its scientific goals, SPO will carry six remote-sensing and four in-situ instruments to measure the vector magnetic fields and Doppler velocity fields in the photosphere, to observed the Sun in the extreme ultraviolet, X-ray, and radio wavelengths, to image the corona and the heliosphere up to 45 $R_\\odot$, and to perform in-situ detection of magnetic fields, and low- and high-energy particles in the solar wind.",

Courtin The title has been modified. 16 pages, 13 figures; final version accepted for publication in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The nuclear rates for reactions involving 12C and 16O are key to compute the energy release and nucleosynthesis of massive stars during their evolution. These rates shape the stellar structure and evolution, and impact the nature of the final compact remnant. We explore the impact of new nuclear reaction rates for 12C({\\alpha},{\\gamma})16O, 12C+12C, 12C+16O and 16O+16O reactions for massive stars. We aim to investigate how the structure and nucleosynthesis evolve and how these processes influence the stellar fate. We computed stellar models using the GENEC code, including updated rates for 12C({\\alpha},{\\gamma})16O and, for the three fusion reactions, new rates following a fusion suppression scenario and new theoretical rates obtained with TDHF calculations. The updated 12C({\\alpha},{\\gamma})16O rates mainly impact the chemical structure evolution changing the 12C/16O ratio with little effect on the CO core mass. This variation in the 12C/16O ratio is critical for predicting the stellar fate, which is very sensitive to 12C abundance. The combined new rates for 12C+12C and 16O+16O fusion reactions according to the HIN(RES) model lead to shorter C- and O-burning lifetimes, and shift the ignition conditions to higher temperatures and densities. Theoretical TDHF rates primarily affect C-burning, increasing its duration and lowering the ignition temperature. These changes alter the core chemical structure, the carbon shell size and duration, and hence the compactness. They also affect nucleosynthesis. This work shows that accurate reaction rates for key processes in massive star evolution drive significant changes in stellar burning lifetimes, chemical evolution, and stellar fate. In addition, discrepancies between experimental and theoretical rates introduce uncertainties in model predictions, influencing both the internal structure and the supernova ejecta composition.",

We present 42 new HBSs discovered based on TESS-SPOC and QLP data. Their physical parameters have been obtained through modeling with appropriate models. Subsequently, Tidally excited oscillations (TEOs) are detected in ten systems, and their pulsation phases and modes are identified. Most pulsation phases can be explained by the dominant being spherical harmonic degree $l=2$ and azimuthal order $m=0$ or $\\pm2$. For TIC 156846634, the harmonic with large deviation ($>3\\sigma$) from the expected adiabatic phase can be expected to be a traveling wave or significantly nonadiabatic. The harmonic numbers $n$ = 16 in TIC 184413651 may not be considered as a TEO candidate due to its large deviation ($>2\\sigma$) from the adiabatic expectation. Moreover, TIC 92828790 shows no TEOs but exhibits a significant $\\gamma$\\,Dor-type pulsation. The eccentricity-period ($e-P$) relation also shows a positive correlation between eccentricity and period, as well as the existence of orbital circularization. The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram shows that TESS HBSs have higher temperatures and greater luminosities than Kepler HBSs, possibly due to selection effects. This significantly enhances the detectability of massive HBSs and those containing TEOs.",

We present a self-consistent numerical model of the source region of the wind, in which jets similar to those observed on the Sun naturally emerge due to magnetic reconnection between closed and open magnetic fields. In this process material is transferred from closed to open field lines and fed into the solar wind. We quantify the mass flux through the magnetic field connected to the heliosphere and find that it greatly exceeds the amount required to sustain the wind. This supports a decades-old suspicion based on spectroscopic observations and shows that magnetic reconnection in the low solar atmosphere could sustain the solar wind.",

Despite promising advancements in post-processing tools, granulation remains a significant concern for the EPRV community. We present a pilot study to detect and characterise granulation using the High-Accuracy Radial-velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) spectrograph. We observed HD166620, a K2 star in the Maunder Minimum phase, intensely for two successive nights, expecting granulation to be the dominant nightly noise source in the absence of strong magnetic activity. Following the correction for a newly identified instrumental signature arising from illumination variations across the CCD, we detected the granulation signal using structure functions and a one-component Gaussian Process (GP) model. The granulation signal exhibits a characteristic timescale of 43.65$\\pm$15.8 minutes, within one $\\sigma$, and a standard deviation of 22.9$\\pm$0.77 cm/s, with in three $\\sigma$ of the predicted value. By examining spectra and RVs as a function of line formation temperature , we investigated the sensitivity of granulation-induced RV variations across different photospheric layers. We extracted RVs from various photospheric depths using both the line-by-line (LBL) and cross-correlation function (CCF) methods to mitigate any extraction method biases. Our findings indicate that granulation variability is detectable in both temperature bins, with the cooler bins, corresponding to the shallower layers of the photosphere, aligning more closely with predicted values.",

Caldwell, Megan Harwell Submitted to the Journal of the Astronautical Sciences Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) Near-Earth asteroid 2024 YR4 was discovered on 2024-12-27 and its probability of Earth impact in December 2032 peaked at about 3% on 2025-02-18. Additional observations ruled out Earth impact by 2025-02-23. However, the probability of lunar impact in December 2032 then rose, reaching about 4% by the end of the apparition in May 2025. James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations on 2025-03-26 estimated the asteroid's diameter at 60 +/- 7 m. Studies of 2024 YR4's potential lunar impact effects suggest lunar ejecta could increase micrometeoroid debris flux in low Earth orbit up to 1000 times above background levels over just a few days, possibly threatening astronauts and spacecraft. In this work, we present options for space missions to 2024 YR4 that could be utilized if lunar impact is confirmed. We cover flyby & rendezvous reconnaissance, deflection, and robust disruption of the asteroid. We examine both rapid-response and delayed launch options through 2032. We evaluate chemical and solar electric propulsion, various launch vehicles, optimized deep space maneuvers, and gravity assists. Re-tasking extant spacecraft and using built spacecraft not yet launched are also considered. The best reconnaissance mission options launch in late 2028, leaving only approximately three years for development at the time of this writing in August 2025. Deflection missions were assessed and appear impractical. However, kinetic robust disruption missions are available with launches between April 2030 and April 2032. Nuclear robust disruption missions are also available with launches between late 2029 and late 2031. Finally, even if lunar impact is ruled out there is significant potential utility in deploying a reconnaissance mission to characterize the asteroid.",

Yet whether open access to these infrastructures translates into more equitable scientific authority remains contested. Astronomy provides a critical case: world-leading observatories are globally shared but embedded in specific national contexts. We compile a novel country--year dataset (1955--2025) linking the location of astronomical facilities with publication usage and authorship roles. This enables us to distinguish between hosting, using, and leading in telescope-based research. Our analysis reveals: (i) usage and impact are heavily concentrated in a small number of facility hubs; (ii) scientific leadership is even more unequal than access or usage (Gini coefficient 0.91 for first/corresponding authorship versus 0.85 for facilities and usage); (iii) hosting and leadership often decouple--countries such as Chile and South Africa mediate large publication volumes without commensurate gains in leading roles; and (iv) global leadership has shifted from U.S. dominance to a multi-hub system centered in the United States, Western Europe, China, Japan, and Australia. These findings challenge the assumption that international access alone democratizes science. We argue that converting participation into leadership requires domestic PI programs, investments in instrumentation and data pipelines, and governance models that distribute credit more equitably. The study highlights how the governance of LSRIs shapes global scientific hierarchies and offers design principles for infrastructures that seek not only to share data but also to broaden scientific authority.",

Physical Review A, 2025, 112(3): 032609 Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Quantum Physics (quant-ph) Resolving high-contrast targets is a fundamental yet highly challenging task in astronomy. Using quantum estimation theory, we demonstrate that the ultimate limit for estimating the separation between two unequal-brightness thermal sources via interferometry remains constant, enabling the potential for superresolution. We give a comparative analysis of two primary stellar interferometric schemes: amplitude interferometry and intensity interferometry. Notably, the nulling strategy employed in amplitude interferometry, a configuration specifically proposed for exoplanet detection by leveraging destructive interference to suppress the brighter source, is quantum optimal for separation estimation. While intensity interferometry is less effective than amplitude interferometry in lossless scenarios and fails to achieve superresolution, it becomes competitive when optical loss in large-scale interferometry is considered. By applying these methodologies to modern stellar interferometry, we highlight the promise of large-scale interferometry for advancing high-resolution astronomical observation.",

To further enhance the mitigation performance of adaptive optics, real-time information about the disturbances acting on the control loop is needed. Current systems therefore employ a combination of wavefront sensor- and accelerometer-based filters. In this work, methods using only data from natural- and laser guide star (NGS, LGS) measurements are presented, as telescopes like the Very Large Telescope already have multiple fast and high-resolution wavefront sensors installed. This approach also avoids the costly installation and operation of additional accelerometers on the optical elements. We introduce two innovative disturbance observer schemes to sense both turbulence and vibration information. A multi-rate estimator for atmospheric influences is based on Kalman filter theory and can incorporate NGS and LGS signals at different loop rates. The estimator for structural perturbations uses Gaussian process regression and can be implemented in an offline and online configuration. We validate the filter designs with data from a realistic end-to-end adaptive optics model with randomly generated turbulence and vibrations. The simulation is fed with on-sky data from the Adaptive Optics Facility of the Very Large Telescope. The presented disturbance observer schemes demonstrate promising results and may be considered as potential alternatives or extensions to existing techniques such as linear-quadratic controllers with Kalman filtering (LQG).",

With growing mirror diameter, the suppression of non-atmospheric disturbances becomes increasingly important. Precise knowledge of the movement of telescope mirrors is essential for understanding and compensating for vibration-based perturbations. A model from VLT accelerometer data for each individual mirror is developed, while the influence of wind buffeting is accounted for by a von Karman wind model. To describe the relevant rigid body motion, we consider the piston, tip and tilt modes of the mirrors. The identification is validated by comparing the power spectral density of the measured and identified modes. Additionally, we assess the robustness of the approach by calculating the identification error over different sections of the data. The study indicates that the employed methods are adequate for the identification of modal telescope vibrations. It is anticipated that said findings will serve as a significant foundation for the development of advanced model-based AO controllers for large telescopes, such as linear quadratic Gaussian control.",

In this work, we report the findings of the first test of this technique using ESA's Tropospheric Delay Calibration System (TDCS) at the complex in Malargue. The data consists in 14 tracking passes of the BepiColombo spacecraft collected between October 2023 and March 2024 during two separate test campaigns. We analyzed the performance of the beam-crossing technique and compared it with the nominal radiometer pointing through the analysis of the Doppler residuals extracted from the orbit determination process. Results show that the beam-crossing performed similarly to the standard pointing, with modest noise reductions and improved stability only at time scales between 100 s and 300 s. Key factors affecting the results include the antenna elevation and the boundary layer height, indicating the need to revisit initial test assumptions, which comprised a fixed boundary layer. Furthermore, comparing the beam-crossing test results with those obtained during the first two BepiColombo superior solar conjunction experiments highlights a potential application of this technique during periods of solar conjunction. However, technical challenges, adverse weather, and limited Ka-band transponder use, reduced the number of analyzed tracking passes. Future studies should therefore expand the dataset to consolidate the results. Furthermore new theoretical studies and test campaigns should elaborate on the selection process for the optimal crossing height.",

VADER is trained on over 100{,}000 synthetic images of PPDs generated from \\texttt{FARGO3D} simulations post-processed with \\texttt{RADMC3D}. Our trained model predicts physical planet and disk parameters with $R^2 > 0.9$ from dust continuum images of PPDs. Applied to 23 real disks, VADER's mass estimates are consistent with literature values and reveal latent correlations that reflect known disk physics.

The Version of Record of this article is published in \\textit{Nature Astronomy}, and is available online at this https URL Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Mitigation of the threat from airbursting asteroids requires an understanding of the potential risk they pose for the ground. How asteroids release their kinetic energy in the atmosphere is not well understood due to the rarity of significant impacts. Ordinary chondrites, in particular L chondrites, represent a frequent type of Earth-impacting asteroids. Here, we present the first comprehensive, space-to-lab characterization of an L chondrite impact. Small asteroid 2023 CX1 was detected in space and predicted to impact over Normandy, France, on 13 February 2023. Observations from multiple independent sensors and reduction techniques revealed an unusual but potentially high-risk fragmentation behavior. The nearly spherical 650 $\\pm$ 160 kg (72 $\\pm$ 6 cm diameter) asteroid catastrophically fragmented around 28 km altitude, releasing 98% of its total energy in a concentrated region of the atmosphere. The resulting shockwave was spherical, not cylindrical, and released more energy closer to the ground. This type of fragmentation increases the risk of significant damage at ground level. These results warrant consideration for a planetary defense strategy for cases where a >3-4 MPa dynamic pressure is expected, including planning for evacuation of areas beneath anticipated disruption locations.",

      "abstract": "TSD: An inverse problem approach for recovering the exoplanetary atmosphere transmission spectrum from high-resolution spectroscopy Nikolai Piskunov, Adam D. Rains, Linn Boldt-Christmas 26 pages, 8 figures. Submitted to ApJ. Comments are welcome Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Our ability to observe, detect, and characterize exoplanetary atmospheres has grown by leaps and bounds over the last 20 years, aided largely by developments in astronomical instrumentation; improvements in data analysis techniques; and an increase in the sophistication and availability of spectroscopic models. Over this time, detections have been made for a number of important molecular species across a range of wavelengths and spectral resolutions. Ground-based observations at high resolution are particularly valuable due to the high contrast achievable between the stellar spectral continuum and the cores of resolved exoplanet absorption features. However, the model-independent retrieval of such features remains a major hurdle in data analysis, with traditional methods being limited by both the choice of algorithm used to remove the non-exoplanetary components of the signal, as well as the accuracy of model template spectra used for cross-correlation. Here we present a new algorithm TSD (Transmission Spectroscopy Decomposition) formulated as an inverse problem in order to minimize the number of assumptions and theoretically modelled components included in the retrieval. Instead of cross-correlation with pre-computed template exoplanet spectra, we rely on high spectral resolution and instrument stability to distinguish between the stellar, exoplanetary, and telluric components and velocity frames in the sequence of absorption spectra taken during multiple transits. We demonstrate the performance of our new method using both simulated and real K band observations from ESO's VLT/CRIRES+ instrument, and present results obtained from two transits of the highly-inflated super-Neptune WASP-107 b which orbits a nearby K7V star.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The goal of this study is to analyze the photometric properties of Deimos using Mars Express (MEX) observations, to improve the photometric properties and provide new insights into the texture and composition of the surface of Deimos, in preparation for the MMX mission. We analyzed the data obtained by the HRSC and the SRC cameras onboard MEX. The HRSC data, obtained through the use of four filters (blue, green, red, IR), provides 390 to 800 m/px resolution, while the SRC data reach 85 to 300 m/px and cover a wide phase angle range (0.06-138°). We performed the disk-integrated and disk-resolved photometric analysis using the Hapke model. The Deimos surface is dark and predominantly backscattering, with a single-scattering albedo (SSA) value (6.8%-7.5%) comparable to Phobos. The Deimos phase curve shows a strong opposition effect due to shadow-hiding, with negligible coherent backscattering. The amplitude and the half-width of the shadow-hiding opposition surge were found to be 2.14 +/- 0.14 and 0.065 +/- 0.004, respectively. We found a high porosity of 86% at the top-layer surface, consistent with complex-shaped grains or fractal aggregates, suggesting a thick dust layer. We did not observe significant variations of the opposition surge across the surface. A blue unit on Deimos, located on streamers of the equatorial ridge, shows reflectance increases up to 58%, and a spectral slope decrease of 50% in comparison with the average surface. This blue unit may be due to a different texture of the surface between the two units, with finer grain and/or higher porosity. Deimos photometric properties, including SSA, opposition surge, and phase integral, are very similar to Phobos. The presence of a blue unit on Deimos reinforces the idea that the Martian moons have a common origin, making the capture of two different bodies with such similar properties unlikely.",

If not mitigated, radiation can interact both with biological and electronic systems, inducing damage and posing significant risk to space missions. Countermeasures can only be studied effectively with ground-based accelerators that act as a proxy for space radiation, typically with a harsher radiation field that worsen the effects of space radiation. Following an in-silico design and optimization process we have developed a galactic cosmic ray (GCR) simulator using a hybrid active-passive methodology. In this approach, the primary beam energy is actively switched and the beam interacts with specifically designed passive modulators. In this paper, we present the implementation of such a GCR simulator and its experimental microdosimetric characterization. Measuring the GCR field is of paramount importance, both before providing it to the user as a validated radiation field and for achieving the best possible radiation description. The issue is addressed in this paper by using a tissue-equivalent proportional counter to measure radiation quality and by comparing experimental measurements with Monte Carlo simulations. In conclusion, we will demonstrate the GCR simulator's capability to reproduce a GCR field.",

The CTAO northern site (CTAO-North, La Palma, Spain) currently hosts LST-1 with the remaining three large-sized telescopes (LSTs) expected in mid-2026 and one medium-sized telescope (MST) expected in mid-2027. The CTAO southern site (CTAO-South, Paranal, Chile) expects the delivery of five small-sized telescopes (SSTs) and two MSTs in early 2026 with on-site construction beginning in mid-2026. The dual-mirrored Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (SCT) is a candidate MST for CTAO-South and is capable of observations in the energy range of 100 GeV to 10 TeV, the core of CTAO's 20 GeV to 300 TeV energy range. Inaugurated in January 2019, the prototype SCT (pSCT) located at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in southern Arizona observed gamma-ray emission from the Crab Nebula at a significance of 8.6 sigma in 2020. The pSCT utilizes a novel dual-mirror optics design and a densely packed focal plane of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). An upgrade of the pSCT camera is underway to fully instrument the camera with 11,328 pixels and an 8-degree diameter FoV. In addition, upgraded electronics will lower the front-end electronics noise, allowing for a lower trigger threshold and improved event reconstruction and background rejection. This work will present the status of the upgrade of the pSCT and discuss the future of the SCT.",

We describe the characterization of imminent impactor 2024 RW$_1$, which was discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey on 2024 September 4 at 05:43 UTC, before it entered the atmosphere near the northern Philippines at 16:39 UTC. We observed 2024 RW$_1$ with the Astrophysical Research Consortium Telescope Imaging Camera on the Apache Point Astrophysical Research Consortium's 3.5-m telescope on 2024 September 4 10:16 UTC. We obtained g, r, i, and z photometry of 2024 RW$_1$, yielding color indices of g-r = 0.47$\\pm$0.04, r-i = 0.13$\\pm$0.04, i-z = -0.11$\\pm$0.07, and g-i = 0.60$\\pm$0.04, corresponding to a spectral slope of 0.67$\\pm$0.40~$\\%$/100 nm.

We detect variations in the time series photometry of the asteroid with an amplitude of $\\sim$0.75, and a double-peaked rotation period of $\\sim$1900 s.

Within BOWIE-ALIGN, we aim to compare JWST spectra of a sample of orbitally aligned and misaligned hot Jupiters orbiting F-type stars to probe the link between hot Jupiter atmospheres and planet formation history. Here, we present a near-infrared transmission spectrum of the aligned planet KELT-7b using one transit observed with JWST NIRSpec/G395H. We find weak features, only tentative evidence for H$_2$O and CO$_2$ in the atmosphere of KELT-7b. This poses a challenge to constrain the atmospheric properties of KELT-7b and two possible scenarios emerge from equilibrium chemistry and free chemistry retrievals: a high-altitude cloud deck muting all features or an extremely low metallicity atmosphere, respectively. The retrieved C/O ratios from our data reductions range from $0.43 - 0.74$, while the atmospheric metallicity is suggested to be solar to super-solar ($1-16 \\times$ solar). Although these wide constraints prevent detailed conclusions about KELT-7b's formation history, a solar-to-super-solar metallicity would imply the accretion of solid material during its formation, which is valuable information for the survey's wider goals of understanding the relative importance of gaseous to solid accretion.",

Working within the planar circular restricted three-body problem, we compute and analyze families of periodic orbits associated with the interior 4:1, 3:1, and 2:1 lunar resonances. These families exhibit a rich bifurcation structure, including transitions between prograde and retrograde branches and connections through collision orbits. We construct stable and unstable manifolds of the unstable resonant orbits using a perigee-based Poincaré map, and identify heteroclinic connections - both between resonant orbits and with lunar $L_1$ libration-point orbits - across a range of Jacobi constant values. Using a new generalized distance metric to quantify the closeness between trajectories, we establish operational times-of-flight for such heteroclinic-type orbit-to-orbit transfers. These connections reveal ballistic, zero-$\\Delta v$ pathways that achieve major orbit changes within reasonable times-of-flight, thus defining a network of accessible semi-major axes. Our results provide a new dynamical framework for long-term spacecraft evolution and cislunar mission design, particularly in regimes where lunar gravity strongly perturbs high Earth orbits.",

      "abstract": "Multiple Giant Impacts and Chemical Equilibria: An Integrated Approach to Rocky Planet Formation Haruya Maeda, Takanori Sasaki 52 pages, 18 figures, accepted for publication in PSJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) During the formation of rocky planets, the surface environments of growing protoplanets were dramatically different from those of present-day planets. The release of gravitational energy during accretion would have maintained a molten surface layer, forming a magma ocean. Simultaneously, sufficiently massive protoplanets could acquire hydrogen-rich proto-atmospheres by capturing gas from the protoplanetary disk. Chemical equilibration among the atmosphere, magma ocean, and iron core plays a key role in determining the planet's interior composition. In this study, we investigate terrestrial planet formation under such primitive surface conditions. We conduct N-body simulations to model the collisional growth from protoplanets to planets, coupled with chemical equilibrium calculations at each giant impact event, where surface melting occurs. Our results show that planetary growth proceeds through a series of giant impacts, and the timing of these impacts relative to the dissipation of disk gas significantly influences the volatile budget. In particular, initial impacts, occurring while nebular gas is still present, can lead to excess hydrogen incorporation into the protoplanet's core. Subsequent impacts with hydrogen-poor bodies, after gas dispersal, can dilute this hydrogen content. This process allows for the formation of a planet with a hydrogen inventory consistent with Earth's current core. Our findings suggest that late giant impacts, occurring after the depletion of nebular gas, provide a viable mechanism for producing Earth-like interior compositions near 1 AU.",

Luk'yanyk, C. Snodgrass, D. Gardener, L. Kolokolova, J. Markkanen, E. Shablovinskaya Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We present observations of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko during its 2021/22 apparition, aiming to investigate its dust and gas environment and compare the results with those obtained in 2015/16 using the same telescope. Quasi-simultaneous photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric observations were carried out at the 6-m BTA SAO telescope. The comet was observed on 6 October 2021, 31 days before perihelion, with \\textit{g}-SDSS and \\textit{r}-SDSS filters, and on 6 February 2022, 96 days after perihelion, using narrowband cometary filters: BC ($\\lambda4450/62$~Å), RC ($\\lambda6839/96$~Å), and CN ($\\lambda3870/58$~Å). These were complemented by images from the 2-m Liverpool Telescope (La Palma). On 6 October 2021, a sunward jet and long dust tail were detected. By 6 February 2022, the dust coma morphology had changed noticeably, revealing a bright sunward neckline structure superimposed on the projected dust tail, along with two jets at position angles of 133$^{\\circ}$ and 193$^{\\circ}$. Spectra showed strong CN emission, with relatively weak C$_2$, C$_3$ and NH$_2$ emissions. The dust production rate $Af\\rho$ did not exceed 200~cm (uncorrected for phase angle) in both epochs. An unusual CN coma morphology was observed, with evidence of an additional CN source associated with dust jets. Geometric modeling of the jets' dynamics indicated an active area at latitude $-70^{\\circ} \\pm 4^{\\circ}$ with a jet opening angle of $20^{\\circ} \\pm 6^{\\circ}$ on 6 October 2021, and two active areas at latitudes $-58^{\\circ} \\pm 5^{\\circ}$ and $-53^{\\circ} \\pm 10^{\\circ}$, separated by longitude $150^{\\circ} \\pm 20^{\\circ}$, producing the observed jets on 6 February 2022. The average particle velocity in the jets was about $0.32 \\pm 0.04$~km~s$^{-1}$.",

Dullemond, Ryan A. Loomis, Ilaria Pascucci, Sebastián Pérez, Shangjia Zhang, Zhaohuan Zhu 11 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables in the main text, a summary plot can be found in Fig. 4, Accepted for publication in ApJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The vertical distribution of pebbles in protoplanetary disks is a fundamental property influencing planet formation, from dust aggregation to the assembly of planetary cores. In the outer region of protoplanetary disks, the intensity of the optically thin but geometrically thick dust ring decreases along the minor axis due to reduced line-of-sight optical depth. Multi-ring disks thus provide an excellent opportunity to study the radial variation of the vertical properties of dust. We investigate the vertical dust distribution in 6 protoplanetary disks with resolved double rings, using high-resolution ALMA Band 6 continuum observations. By modeling the azimuthal intensity variations in these rings, we constrain the dust scale heights for each ring. Our results reveal a dichotomy: inner rings exhibit puffed-up dust layers with heights comparable to the gas scale height, while outer rings are significantly more settled, with dust scale heights less than 20\\% of the gas scale height. This suggests a radial dependence in dust settling efficiency within the disks, potentially driven by localized planetary interactions or the global radial dependence of the Vertical Shear Instability (VSI). We discuss the implications of these findings for dust trapping, planet formation, and protoplanetary disk evolution. Our work highlights the importance of vertical dust distribution in understanding the early stages of planet formation and suggests that outer ($>80$~au), settled rings are preferred sites for planet formation over inner ($<80$~au), turbulent rings.",

      "abstract": "Massive Retrograde Moons May Survive During Different Hot Jupiters' Migration Scenario Yangjun Pu, Chenyang Li, Bohang Zhu Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Searching for exomoons is attempted via Kepler and TESS, but none is confirmed. Theoretically, similar with Jupiter, the gas giants are possible to generate moons. However, HJs which are considered to form outside and then move close to the star are thought not easy to sustain the original moons via dynamical effects. In this paper, we assume the HJ to form at 1 AU and move inward via disk migration or migration due to planet secular coplanar. Then we simulate the dynamics of exomoon-planet systems during migration, and we want to study the fates of different original moons. We find that both prograde and retrograde moons could maintain stable after disk migration, although the retained fraction of retrograde moons is 5 times higher than the prograde moons. Only massive and retrograde moons (greater than 10 Earth masses) might survive around HJs during the coplanar excitation. Furthermore, 6\\% of the original Jupiter-like planet can also form free-floating planets after undergoing coplanar excitation, and most of them retain their moons. Our results focus on the fate of the exomoons and provide a clue on where to find the moon for future missions.",

      "abstract": "Redefining interiors and envelopes: hydrogen-silicate miscibility and its consequences for the structure and evolution of sub-Neptunes James G. Rogers, Edward D. Young, Hilke E. Schlichting 17 pages, 11 figures, resubmitted to MNRAS after revision Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We present the first evolving interior structure model for sub-Neptunes that accounts for the miscibility between silicate magma and hydrogen. Silicate and hydrogen are miscible above $\\sim 4000$K at pressures relevant to sub-Neptune interiors. Using the H$_2$-MgSiO$_3$ phase diagram, we self-consistently couple physics and chemistry to determine the radial extent of the fully miscible interior. Above this region lies the envelope, where hydrogen and silicates are immiscible and exist in both gaseous and melt phases. The binodal surface, representing a phase transition, provides a physically/chemically informed boundary between a planet's \"interior\" and \"envelope\". We find that young sub-Neptunes can store several tens of per cent of their hydrogen mass within their interiors. As the planet cools, its radius and the binodal surface contract, and the temperature at the binodal drops from $\\sim 4000$K to $\\sim 3000$K. Since the planet's interior stores hydrogen, its density is lower than that of pure-silicate. Gravitational contraction and thermal evolution lead to hydrogen exsolving from the interior into the envelope. This process slows planetary contraction compared to models without miscibility, potentially producing observable signatures in young sub-Neptune populations. At early times ($\\sim 10$-$100$Myr), the high temperature at the binodal surface results in more silicate vapour in the envelope, increasing its mean molecular weight and enabling convection inhibition. After $\\sim$Gyr of evolution, most hydrogen has exsolved, and the radii of miscible and immiscible models converge. However, the internal distribution of hydrogen and silicates remains distinct, with some hydrogen retained in the interior.",
