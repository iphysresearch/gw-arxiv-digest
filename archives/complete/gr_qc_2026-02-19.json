Odintsov General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We conjecture the possibility of negative mass objects (NMOs) existing in the sky. It is shown that they may not be so exotic as usually expected. We show that NMOs appear as solutions of standard gravitational equations if we consider the system of a compact positive mass object, cosmological fluid and negative cosmological constant. We also construct models which generate such NMOs as solutions within the two-scalar theory and scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity inspired by string theory. The orbits of the photon and massive particles are investigated in the background, where there is a negative mass object which realises a kind of effective anti-gravity. It is explicitly found that the bound system consisting of a positive mass object and a negative mass object can be formed in spite that a positive mass object suffers the repulsive force from the NMO. The possibility that such exotic objects might be observed is discussed. A simple conjecture about their possible masses is made, too. As an even more exotic object, we consider a non-trivial object with vanishing mass and investigate its properties.",

Pantig, Bobomurat Ahmedov General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We investigate horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) and optical signatures for a broad class of regular black holes sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics. The spacetimes considered are static, spherically symmetric, and nonsingular, and they include Bardeen-like, and Hayward-like regular black-hole limits as spacial cases. We characterize the horizon structure and thermodynamics properties, and we compute key optical observables by determining the photon-sphere location and the corresponding shadow size as seen by distant observers, including controlled perturbative limits and full numerical solutions. Using angular-size constraints for SgrA* and M87* from the Event Horizon Telescope and the GRAVITY collaboration, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to infer the admissible parameter ranges of the model and to quantify degeneracies among the black-hole mass and nonlinear-electrodynimcs parameters. On the quantum side, we develop the near-horizon reduction relevant for HBAR, showing that the dominant sector governing the detector response exhibits conformal behavior and leads to a thermal excitation spectrum governed by the horizon temperature. We formulate a Lindblad master-equation description of the radiation field, identify the thermal steady state, and derive an HBAR entropy-energy relation consistent with a Clausius-type first law. Finally, we establish a Wien-type displacement law for the HBAR spectrum, expressing the peak wavelength in terms of the horizon thermodynamics, thereby providing an additional observable link between nonlinear electrodynamics, regularity, and near-horizon quantum radiation.",

      "abstract": "Black-hole thermodynamics in doubly special relativity: local-frame MDRs and rainbow metrics Abdelmalek Boumali General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) deforms special-relativistic kinematics while preserving the relativity principle by introducing a second invariant scale, typically the Planck energy $E_{\\rm Pl}$. Extending DSR-inspired modified dispersion relations (MDRs) to curved spacetimes is challenging, as ambiguous definitions of the deformation energy risk reintroducing preferred frames. We review three common extensions beyond flat spacetime: (i) MDRs in local orthonormal frames on fixed backgrounds, (ii) phase-space/Hamiltonian geometry with relative locality, and (iii) rainbow metrics. Using black-hole thermodynamics for static spherically symmetric horizons, we compare two implementations: (A) energy-independent background with local-frame MDR, and (B) energy-dependent rainbow metric. When the same prescription is used for the deformation energy scale $E_\\star$, both approaches yield identical Hawking temperatures: \\begin{equation} T(E_\\star)=T_0\\,\\frac{g(E_\\star/E_{\\rm Pl})}{f(E_\\star/E_{\\rm Pl})}\\,,\\qquad T_0=\\frac{\\kappa_0}{2\\pi}\\,, \\end{equation} where $\\kappa_0$ is the classical surface gravity. This $g/f$ scaling holds for examples such as Amelino--Camelia-type MDRs (leading correction $\\propto E p^2/E_{\\rm Pl}$, giving $T(E_\\star)\\simeq T_0(1-\\frac{\\eta}{2}E_\\star/E_{\\rm Pl})$ for $\\eta>0$) and the Magueijo--Smolin invariant ($f=g$, so $T(E_\\star)=T_0$). Further DSR effects on evaporation (thresholds, phase space, greybody factors, composition laws) are discussed. Discrepancies in the literature arise mainly from different choices of $E_\\star$ (energy at infinity vs.\\ local frame). For macroscopic black holes, corrections are suppressed by $T_0/E_{\\rm Pl}$ and become relevant only near the Planck regime, where full quantum gravity dominates.",

This work extends previous studies, which have predominantly focused on models with either symmetric bounces or asymmetric bounces restricted to homogeneous dust configurations. Our analysis emphasises the phenomenological implications of the model through a combination of analytical and numerical investigations, with particular attention to singularity resolution and the formation of trapped surfaces. As in symmetric bounce models, the central curvature singularity inside the collapsing dust cloud is resolved. However, in contrast to the symmetric case, we find that a singularity emerges in the polymerised vacuum region during the bounce phase. This singularity can be identified as a shell-crossing singularity and exhibits the expected power-law behaviour of curvature scalars. Furthermore, likewise to the symmetric bounce models, we find a critical mass threshold governing the formation of inner and outer horizons in the pre-bounce phase. No analogous critical mass restriction arises for the formation of the inner horizon in the post-bounce phase, highlighting a qualitative difference between the pre- and post-bounce dynamics.",

Barros General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate quantum and classical signatures of a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in a Hernquist dark matter halo. Starting from the exact spherically symmetric solution describing this composite system, we analyze particle production for both bosonic and fermionic fields using semiclassical techniques. Hawking radiation is derived through Bogoliubov transformations and independently via the tunneling method with energy conservation, allowing us to identify the effective temperature, emission spectrum, and the role of dark matter parameters in suppressing particle creation. The evaporation process is examined in the high-frequency regime, leading to modified evaporation times and emission rates relative to the vacuum Schwarzschild case. We further study absorption and scattering of massless scalar waves employing a partial-wave analysis, computing phase shifts, partial and total cross sections, and assessing the impact of the Hernquist scale radius and density on these observables. Finally, null and timelike geodesics are explored to characterize light propagation and particle motion in the presence of the dark matter halo.",

      "abstract": "Static black holes in an external uniform electromagnetic field: Reissner-Nordstrom accelerating in Bertotti-Robinson Hryhorii Ovcharenko, Jiri Podolsky General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We provide a detailed analysis of the non-twisting subcase of the large class of type D black holes with a non-aligned electromagnetic field, presented recently in [H. Ovcharenko and J. Podolsky, Phys. Rev. D 112 (2025) 064076]. We show that such exact solutions split into two main subclasses that (after a suitable re-parametrization) can be interpreted as either the uncharged Schwarzschild or C-metric in the external Bertotti-Robinson (BR) spacetime with geometry ${\\mathrm{AdS}_2\\times\\mathrm{S}_2}$, or as the charged Reissner-Nordstrom black hole accelerating in the external BR electromagnetic field. The distinction between these two subclasses is determined by the parameter $r_0$ that encodes relations between the external Maxwell field (given by the non-aligned components of the Faraday tensor ${\\Phi_0=\\Phi_2}$) and the Maxwell field created by the charge of the black hole (given by the aligned component $\\Phi_1$). Namely, if ${r_0=0}$ then the electromagnetic field is fully determined by ${\\Phi_0=\\Phi_2}$, and one gets the C-metric in the BR universe (including also the non-accelerating Schwarzschild-BR black hole). But if ${r_0\\neq 0}$ then the electromagnetic field is independently determined by both the external BR field and the field of a black hole itself, and this can be interpreted as the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole accelerating in the Bertotti-Robinson spacetime. Even though such an interpretation of the spacetime family is quite simple, it contains a lot of subtleties (e.g. the no-charge limit of the RN-BR spacetime, the non-trivial dependence on the signs of the mass and charge of a black hole, extreme black holes, and others) which we carefully investigate in this work. We also show the explicit relation to solutions previously found by Van den Bergh and Carminati, and we discuss the connection to the Alekseev-Garcia and Alexeev solutions.",

Here we explore the variational formulation of classical Einstein-Hilbert gravity as initial value problem by constructing its Schwinger-Keldysh-Galley (SKG) action, including a careful treatment of boundary terms. The construction is based on a doubling of degrees of freedom and independent of a foliation. The action naturally decomposes into a bulk term furnishing Einstein's equations and a boundary term, which is related to conserved quantities, such as the Komar mass. We find that since only trivial connecting conditions must be specified on boundaries, the variational action principle for gravity as an initial value problem is rendered well-posed without the need to add additional boundary terms. The SKG approach to gravity offers a novel and complementary avenue to solve for the metric of spacetime directly from the action, bypassing the governing equations.",

Maharaj General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) For a static and spherically symmetric spacetime, we investigate the class of exact solutions that arise when two fundamental geometric constraints are imposed simultaneously: the Karmarkar's condition and the vanishing of the Weyl tensor. These conditions restrict the curvature in such a way that the spacetime becomes conformally flat and belongs to the family of embedding class-I solutions. Even though the subsequent solutions namely, the Schwarzschild interior solution and the de Sitter solution are well known, the novelty of our presentation is that these solutions are shown to be a direct consequence of the imposed geometric constraints. The physical matter composition becomes highly constrained by the associated geometry under such conditions. The Schwarzschild interior solution describes the spacetime of an incompressible fluid sphere while the de Sitter solution corresponds to a vacuum energy dominated configuration. Interestingly, pressure anisotropy as well as `complexity factor' vanish identically once the Karmarkar's condition and the conformal flatness conditions are applied simultaneously. As these two geometric constraints alone are sufficient to determine the background spacetime uniquely, Karmarkar's condition might not be a suitable method for the development of realistic stellar models in a conformally flat spacetime unless one invokes other factors into consideration such as time-dependent metric potentials.",

The presence of the wave pulse in such a black hole is modeled via a function $H(u)$ appearing in a restricted version of a generic Bondi-Sachs type line element. Choosing a sech-squared profile for $H(u)$, we first study (numerically) geodesic separation and geodesic deviation in a flat background. Thereafter, similar investigations are carried out in the presence of the black hole, but in regions far away from the vicinity of the horizon. Our results suggest the presence of a distinct displacement memory effect, which depends on the value of the regularisation parameter $g$ as well as the pulse height. Between different types of regular black holes, one notices parameter-dependent changes in the net displacement memory. Further, a clear difference in the magnitude of displacement memory (at large $u$) in regular and singular black holes is also visible in our numerical results.",

We first study the motion of neutral test particles and derive the fundamental orbital and epicyclic frequencies, which are then employed to analyze different quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) models. Using observational QPO data from stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black hole candidates, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis and obtain constraints on the black hole parameters. The results show that the presence of the quantum correction significantly affects the location of the QPO radii and the separation between the QPO orbit and the ISCO. We then examine the scalar perturbations by deriving the Schrödinger-like radial equation and the corresponding effective potential. The influence of the parameters $Q$ and $\\zeta$ on the perturbation potential and stability of the spacetime is discussed. Furthermore, we compute the greybody factor and the energy emission rate in the high-frequency (geometric-optics) regime, showing how the quantum correction modifies the absorption probability and radiation spectrum. Finally, we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the black hole entropy and obtain the logarithmic corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. We show that these corrections become important for small black holes, while for large horizon radius the standard thermodynamic behavior is recovered. Our analysis demonstrates that the quantum correction parameter leaves observable imprints on both dynamical and thermodynamical properties of the spacetime and can be constrained through QPO observations.",

In addition, gravitational waveforms exhibit significant phase differences: an increase in $\\zeta$ induces a phase delay, whereas an increase in $b$ results in a phase advance. A one-year simulation of the orbital evolution of an extreme mass ratio inspiral demonstrates that when $b=2$ and $\\zeta\\approx10^{-6}$, the mismatch between the gravitational waveforms predicted for the nonlocal gravity black hole and those for the Schwarzschild black hole reaches the distinguishable threshold ($\\mathcal{M}=0.0125$), providing a basis for observational discrimination between general relativity and nonlocal gravity.",

In this model - the setting for a number of prominent case studies on black hole formation - charged massless particles may instantaneously change direction (bounce) after losing all their 4-momentum due to electrostatic repulsion. We initiate the study of timelike bounce hypersurfaces in spherical symmetry: scenarios in which an incoming beam of charged null dust changes direction along a timelike surface $\\mathcal{B}$, which is the (free) boundary of an interacting 2-dust region. We identify a novel decoupling of the equations of motion in this region. First, it is shown that every timelike curve segment $\\gamma$ in the spherically symmetric quotient of Minkowski or Reissner-Nordström spacetimes arises as the bounce hypersurface $\\mathcal{B}$ of a charged null dust beam incident from past null infinity $\\mathcal{I}^-$. We construct a spacetime $(\\mathcal{M},g_{\\mu\\nu})$ describing the full trajectory of the beam, which includes gluing to Reissner-Nordström and Vaidya regions. Across $\\mathcal{B}$ the metric has regularity $g_{\\mu\\nu}\\in C^{2,1}$ and satisfies Einstein's equation classically, while $C^\\infty$ gluing may be achieved across all other interfaces. We also obtain examples of timelike bounce hypersurfaces terminating in a null point. Since these constructions are teleological, we secondly consider a given charged incoming beam from past null infinity. We formulate and solve a free boundary problem which represents the formation of a timelike bounce hypersurface. The result is conditional, applying only in the exterior region of a Reissner-Nordström spacetime, and subject to a technical regularity condition.",

      "abstract": "Physical properties and the maximum compactness bound of a class of compact stars in $f(Q)$ gravity Arpita Ghosh, Abhishek Paul, Ranjan Sharma, Samstuti Chanda General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Motivation: Motivated by the growing interest in understanding the role of non-metricity in describing dense stellar systems, in this paper, we study compact stellar configurations within the framework of linear $f(Q)$ gravity. Methodology: By adopting a linear modification of the form $f(Q) = \\alpha Q+\\beta$, we analyze the internal structure and physical properties of an anisotropic relativistic star within the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity. We employ the Karmarkar's condition together with the Vaidya-Tikekar metric ansatz to obtain a closed-form interior solution of the star. The interior solution is then matched to the Schwarzschild exterior solution across the boundary of the star. By varying the model parameters, we analyze physical features of the resultant stellar configuration. Results: We note distinctive features in the density, pressure, anisotropy and total mass of the star under a such modification. By enforcing the condition that the central pressure remains finite, we obtain the maximum compactness bound which is shown to depend solely on the Vaidya-Tikekar curvature parameter $K$. We recover the Buchdahl bound for the curvature parameter $K=0$, which corresponds to the solution for an isotropic and homogeneous fluid sphere. Utilizing the energy density and radial pressure profiles, we numerically integrate the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations and obtain the mass-radius ($M-R$) relationships for different values of the model parameter $\\alpha$. We note that for higher values of $\\alpha$, the maximum mass and radius decrease, shifting the stable branch towards ultra-compact configurations. An interesting observation in our analysis is that a linearly modified $f(Q)$ gravity model can support comparatively low mass stars. Utilizing the observed mass of some known pulsars, we demonstrate how our model can be used to fine-tune the radius of the star.",

Rev. D 113, 044042 (2026) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) In static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, the deflection angle of photons in the strong deflection limit exhibits a logarithmic divergence. We introduce an analytical framework that clarifies the physical origin of this divergence by employing local, coordinate-invariant geometric quantities alongside the properties of the matter distribution. In contrast to conventional formulations -- where the divergence rate $\\bar{a}$ is expressed via coordinate-dependent metric functions -- our approach relates $\\bar{a}$ to the components of the Einstein tensor in an orthonormal basis adapted to the spacetime symmetry. By applying the Einstein equations, we derive the expression \\begin{align*} \\bar{a}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-8\\pi R_{\\mathrm{m}}^2\\left(\\rho_{\\mathrm{m}}+\\Pi_{\\mathrm{m}}\\right)}}, \\end{align*} where $\\rho_{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\Pi_{\\mathrm{m}}$ denote the local energy density and tangential pressure evaluated at the photon sphere of areal radius $R_{\\mathrm{m}}$. This result reveals that $\\bar{a}$ is intrinsically governed by the local matter distribution, with the universal value $\\bar{a}=1$ emerging when $\\rho_{\\mathrm{m}}+\\Pi_{\\mathrm{m}}=0$. Notably, this finding resolves the long-standing puzzle of obtaining $\\bar{a}=1$ in a class of spacetimes supported by a massless scalar field. Furthermore, these local properties are reflected in the frequencies of quasinormal modes, suggesting a profound connection between strong gravitational lensing and the dynamical response of gravitational wave signals.",

We first analyze the geodesics of a test particle and derive weak-field constraints on parameter $\\xi$ from the perihelion precession of orbits, using observations from the Solar System and the S2 star's orbit around $\\text{SgrA}^\\star$ supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy. We obtain $\\xi \\leq 0.01869$ and $\\xi \\leq 0.73528$ using the analysis of Solar System observations and the orbit of the S2 star around $\\text{SgrA}^\\star$, respectively. In the strong-field regime, we examine the dynamics of epicyclic motion around astrophysical black holes and, using observational data from four QPO sources and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, we determine the upper constraint $\\xi \\leq 2.086$. Our results provide new insights into the effects of quantum corrections on black hole spacetimes and highlight the potential of QPOs as a probe for testing quantum gravity in astrophysical environments.",

We find no evidence of an instability on timescales of $t \\mu \\sim 10^4$ (in units of the scalar mass), when allowing the star to be perturbed either solely by discretization error or by imposing various types of perturbations to our initial data. We find that the initially imposed perturbations exhibit slow decay, even for magnitudes just below the order where immediate collapse is induced.",

      "abstract": "Multibanded Reduced Order Quadrature Techniques for Gravitational Wave Inference Murdoc Newell, Alexis Boudon, Hong Qi General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Reduced-order quadrature (ROQ) is commonly used to accelerate parameter estimation in gravitational wave astronomy; however, constructing ROQ bases can be computationally costly, particularly for longer-duration signals. We propose a modified construction strategy based on PyROQ that accelerates this process by performing the basis search using multiband waveforms, without compromising the desired likelihood accuracy. We use this altered method to construct a set of ROQs in the sub-solar mass (SSM) range using the IMRPhenomXAS_NRTidalV3 waveform. Compared to PyROQ's standard ROQ method, we find a decrease in basis size of 20% to 30% and observe a decrease in basis construction time by 5 to 20 times, reducing from two weeks to a couple of days. We verify the bases built with this method by injecting simulated gravitational waves into LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA design noise and recovering the parameters, and we find that they preserve the likelihood accuracy and maintain consistent parameter estimation results.",
