      "abstract": "Universal Relations for Elastic Hybrid Stars and Quark Stars Chun-Ming Yip, Shu Yan Lau, Kent Yagi High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th) Some compact stars may contain deconfined quark matter, forming hybrid stars or quark stars. If the quark matter forms an inhomogeneous condensate in the crystalline color superconducting phase, its rigidity may be high enough to noticeably alter the stellar properties. In this paper, we investigate whether these elastic stars follow the universal relations, i.e., relations insensitive to equations of state, that have been well established for fluid stars. We improve upon previous studies by allowing quark matter in the background, static, and spherically symmetric configuration to be sheared. Such background shear can be treated in the form of an effective pressure anisotropy. We then calculate the moment of inertia $I$, tidal deformability ${\\lambda}_2$, and spin-induced quadrupole moment $Q$ of these models with pressure anisotropy. The $I$-${\\lambda}_2$-$Q$ universal relations for the elastic hybrid (quark) star models are valid up to a variation of $\\approx2\\,(3)\\%$, larger than that for typical fluid star models, when the maximal magnitude of quark matter shear modulus is considered in the crystalline color superconducting phase from realistic calculations. The uncertainty in universal relations related to the stellar compactness for these elastic star models, on the other hand, remain comparable to those for typical fluid star models. Our results demonstrate the validity of universal relations for hybrid stars and quark stars with a realistic degree of pressure anisotropy due to the crystalline color superconducting quark matter.",

Submitted to ApJ. Comments welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (LVK) Collaboration has detected numerous binary black hole mergers with properties that challenge standard binary evolution scenarios, such as component masses above the pair-instability gap and high spin magnitudes. Dense stellar environments such as globular clusters provide a natural channel for producing such systems through hierarchical mergers, where black hole remnants formed in earlier mergers are retained in the cluster and undergo successive mergers. However, gravitational-wave recoil kicks often eject merger remnants from typical globular clusters, which limits hierarchical growth. Massive clusters with deeper potential wells, such as those found in giant elliptical galaxies like M87, may overcome this barrier, but direct simulations of such massive globular clusters remains computationally challenging. In this study, we present a 10-million-body cluster simulation performed with the $\\texttt{Cluster Monte Carlo}$ ($\\texttt{CMC}$) code, referred to as $\\texttt{colossus}$, which serves as a proxy for the most massive low-metallicity globular clusters observed in the local Universe. This simulation demonstrates that extended chains of hierarchical mergers can occur in massive globular clusters, producing black holes up to fifth generation with masses approaching $250\\,M_\\odot$, comparable to the most massive LVK events observed to date (e.g., GW231123). Combining the $\\texttt{colossus}$ simulation with the previous $\\texttt{CMC Cluster Catalog}$, we develop a framework to extrapolate binary black hole merger predictions for the thousands of globular clusters seen in the Virgo Supercluster.",

Submitted to A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Low-latency analyses of gravitational-wave (GW) data from LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA enable rapid detection of compact binary coalescences (CBC) and prompt sky localization, essential for electromagnetic follow-up in multi-messenger astronomy. We evaluate the performance and limitations of low-latency sky localization using BAYESTAR algorithm, and investigate the impact of low-significance Virgo triggers. We inject simulated CBC signals into Gaussian-stationary noise and into Virgo data from the second part of the third LIGO-Virgo observing run (O3b), then reconstruct skymaps across multiple detector network configurations. Localization accuracy is assessed using Percentile-Percentile plots, the Jaccard index, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Binary neutron star mergers are statistically consistent with ideal calibration, showing deviations below 3$\\sigma$, particularly when Virgo is included in the network, whereas skymaps for neutron star--black hole and binary black hole mergers tend to be overconfident. Adding a third detector generally improves accuracy, but the searched area can degrade when Virgo's signal-to-noise ratio is low (SNR $\\leq$ 5). For high-SNR events, relying on two detectors can mislocalize the source. Excluding Virgo can therefore cause the HL skymap to miss the true location when Virgo has strong antenna response, in such cases a three-detector configuration is required to recover the correct position and avoid misleading multi-messenger follow-up. We introduce diagnostics to flag problematic skymaps and apply them to O3 public alerts, recovering simulation-predicted trends and flagging a few anomalous morphologies. The results are relevant for improving rapid vetting of GW alerts and guiding observational strategies in multi-messenger astronomy.",

However, unlike binary neutron stars, redshift information is not available from GW observations of binary black holes. Consequently, independent redshift measurements of such GW events are necessary to measure $H_0$. In this study, we demonstrate a novel Bayesian formalism to infer $H_0$ utilizing the $3$D cross-correlation of GW events with galaxies from flux-limited catalog in configuration space. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method with $300$ simulated GW events distributed within $1$ Gpc in colored Gaussian noise of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors operating at O4 sensitivity. We show that such measurements can constrain the Hubble constant with a precision of $\\sim 9 \\%$ ($90\\%$ highest density interval). We highlight the potential improvements that need to be accounted for in further studies before the method can be applied to real data.",

This is recognized as the ``overproduction problem\", which calls for nontrivial features in the early universe. In this paper, we try to check out whether a modified dispersion relation (MDR) of the primordial perturbations can be helpful for solving the problem. From the constraint on PTA data, we obtain a posterior distribution of the parameters of primordial perturbation, and find that the MDR model, where the $k^4$ term becomes important at later time, can give rise to a broken-power-law (BPL) power spectrum which can alleviate the overproduction problem to nearly $2\\sigma$ level. However, to improve furtherly into $1\\sigma$ still needs small negative non-Gaussianity, e.g. $f_{\\rm nl}\\simeq -1$. The mass distribution of the PBHs generated is also discussed.",

H. Pang, Tim Dietrich High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We study the gravitational-wave trigger GW231109_235456, a sub-threshold binary neutron star merger candidate observed in the first part of the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. Assuming the trigger is of astrophysical origin, we analyze it using state-of-the-art waveform models and investigate the robustness of the inferred source parameters under different prior choices in Bayesian inference. We assess the implications for population studies, nuclear physics, and multi-messenger astronomy. Analysing the component masses, we find that GW231109_235456 supports the proposed double Gaussian mass distribution of neutron star masses. Moreover, we find that the remnant most likely collapsed promptly to a black hole and that, because of the large distance, a possible kilonova connected to the merger was noticeably dimmer than AT2017gfo. In addition, we provide constraints on the equation of state from GW231109_235456 alone, as well as combined with GW170817 and GW190425. In our projections for the future, we simulate a similar event using the upcoming generation of gravitational-wave detectors. Our findings indicate that we can constrain the neutron star radius with an accuracy of 400 meters using the Einstein Telescope alone, or 300 meters when combined with the Cosmic Explorer, both at 90% credibility.",

Such acceleration would modulate the characteristics of the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in X-ray black hole binaries. In this paper, we explore the influence of spin-aligned acceleration of a black hole on QPOs observed in X-ray binaries. For this purpose, we compute the fundamental frequencies arising from the motion of test particles around an accelerating (spin-aligned) black hole and apply the relativistic precession, parametric resonance, and forced resonance models to establish their correspondence with several observed QPOs of X-ray binaries (GRO J1655-40, XTE J1550-564, XTE J1859+226, GRS 1915+105, H1743-322, M82~X-1, and Sgr~A$^{*}$). We then employ the Bayesian Markov-Chain Monte Carlo method to constrain the black hole parameters.

In this work, we explore the potential of uncovering the SMBHB population and its redshift dependence by combining the SGWB signal and its anisotropies with galaxy distribution through cross-correlation analyses. Using a Fisher analysis technique, we show that the SGWB power spectrum alone can not provide any information on the evolutionary history of SMBHBs, whereas the inclusion of the angular power spectrum of the SGWB and its cross-correlation with the galaxy distribution substantially improves constraints on the redshift evolution parameters. Assuming pulsar timing array (PTA) configurations achievable in the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) era, we find that the combined use of isotropic and anisotropic SGWB signals, together with galaxy surveys, can provide valuable measurements of the redshift evolution of the SMBH-galaxy connection and the frequency distribution of SMBHBs. These results highlight the potential of joint GW-galaxy studies to address the long-standing open question of SMBH growth and evolution across cosmic time.",

First, we obtain the generic phase diagram of possible mass-radius relation forms for the HybQSs. Then, utilizing a well-established general parameterization of interacting quark matter, we construct quark star models featuring sharp first-order quark-quark phase transitions of various types, in contrast to the hadron-quark transition in conventional hybrid stars. We systematically investigate how recent observations, such as the pulsar mass measurement $M_{\\rm TOV}\\gtrsim2M_{\\odot}$ and the GW170817's tidal deformability bound $\\Lambda_{1.4M_{\\odot}}<800$, constrain the viable parameter space. We also identified twin stars in some of the HybQS parameter space. Furthermore, we found that the quark-quark phase transitions in hybrid quark stars may also cause the deviation from the approximate universal relation between the dominant postmerger frequency $f_{\\rm peak}$ and tidal deformability $\\Lambda_{1.35M_{\\odot}}$, which was previously believed to only be caused by the hadron-quark phase transitions in hybrid neutron stars.

D 112, 083055 (2025) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) The air shower array Carpet-3 detected a 300 TeV photon from the direction of GRB 221009A at 4536 s after the Fermi-GBM trigger for this event. If the association with this gamma-ray burst is real, it poses two puzzles. First, why was this photon not absorbed by the extragalactic background light? ``New physics'' beyond the Standard Model is required to explain how it managed to reach Earth from a cosmological distance. Second, why was this photon detected when the VHE afterglow observed by LHAASO already faded? A novel astrophysical mechanism is required to explain this delay. In this work we show that Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), which arises as a low-energy limit of certain quantum gravity theories, can solve both puzzles. It shifts thresholds of particle interaction and changes the opacity of the extragalactic background, and cause energy-dependent variations of the photon velocity, which changes the photon time of flight. We investigate the LIV parameter space assuming that the 300 TeV photon is a part of the VHE afterglow detected by LHAASO in the TeV range. We identify viable solutions and place stringent two-sided constraints on the LIV energy scale required to resolve the observational puzzles. First-order LIV appears to be incompatible with the constraints set by analyzing the TeV afterglow of this GRB. Viable solutions emerge for higher orders. In particular, the commonly studied second-order subluminal LIV with $E_{\\rm LIV2} = 1.30_{-0.35}^{+0.56} \\times 10^{-7} E_{\\rm Pl}$ (95.4% credibility level; $E_{\\rm Pl}$ is the Planck energy) is consistent with all the observed data.",

CHRONOS combines a ring-cavity Sagnac interferometer with torsion-bar test masses to realize the first quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of angular momentum in a macroscopic system. By implementing a speed-meter readout in the rotational degree of freedom, CHRONOS coherently cancels quantum radiation-pressure noise and enables sub-Hz observations. We show that detuned power recycling and cavity-length optimization can simultaneously relax technical requirements on both torsion bars and speed meters. Assuming a realistic optical design with a 1m torsion bar, we estimate strain sensitivities of $h \\simeq 1 \\times 10^{-18}\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1Hz for detectors with arm lengths of 2.5m, 40m, and 300m. These sensitivities enable (i) direct detection of intermediate-mass black hole binaries up to 380Mpc with ${\\rm SNR}=3$, (ii) probing stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds down to $\\Omega_{\\rm GW} \\sim 3.2 \\times 10^{-9}$ at 0.2Hz with 5yr accumulation. Furthermore, CHRONOS enables prompt detection of gravity-gradient signals from magnitude-5.5 earthquakes even with a 2.5m prototype. CHRONOS thus opens new opportunities for quantum-limited geophysical observation and multi-band, multi-messenger gravitational-wave astronomy.",

Ignoring such binary effects may bias the results, while accounting for them explicitly quickly becomes infeasible as each of the $N$ data points introduces an additional parameter, resulting in an exponentially growing number of possible configurations ($2^N$). We show that, under generic conditions, an exact treatment of these binary corrections leads to a mathematical form identical to the well-known Ising model from statistical physics. This connection opens up a powerful set of tools developed for the Ising model, enabling fast and accurate likelihood calculations. We present efficient approximation schemes with minimal computational cost and demonstrate their effectiveness in applications, including Type Ia supernova calibration, where we show that the uncertainty in host-galaxy mass classification has negligible impact on the inferred value of the Hubble constant.",

Wik 12 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in A&A Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The velocity field of intracluster gas in galaxy clusters contains key information on the virialization of infalling material, the dissipation of AGN energy into the surrounding medium, and the validity of the hydrostatic hypothesis. The statistical properties of the velocity field are characterized by its fluctuation power spectrum, which is usually expected to be well described by an injection scale and a turbulent cascade. Here we propose a simulation-based inference technique to retrieve the properties of the velocity power spectrum from X-ray micro-calorimeter data by generating simulations of Gaussian random fields from a parametric power spectrum model. We forward model the measured bulk velocities and velocity dispersions by including the most relevant observational effects (projection, emissivity weighting, PSF smearing). We then train a neural network to learn the mapping between the power spectrum parameters and the generated data vectors. Considering a three-parameter model describing turbulent energy injection on large scales and a power-law cascade, we found that two XRISM/Resolve pointings are sufficient to accurately determine the turbulent Mach number and set interesting constraints on the injection scale. Applying our method to the Coma cluster data, we obtain a model that is characterized by a large injection scale that rivals the size of the cluster ($\\ell_{inj}=2.2_{-1.0}^{+2.0}$ Mpc). When this power spectrum model is integrated over the cluster scales ($0<\\ell<R_{500}=1.4 $Mpc), the Mach number of the gas motions is $\\mathcal{M}_{3D,500}=0.45_{-0.13}^{+0.18}$, which exceeds the value derived from the velocity dispersions only. Further observations covering a wider area are required to decrease the cosmic variance and constrain the slope of the turbulent cascade.",

However, their observational classification remains poorly constrained due to the limited number of confirmed detections. This study presents a detailed multi-frequency, high-sensitivity, and high-resolution analysis of diffuse radio emission in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 13. Using GMRT (147.5 MHz), uGMRT (400 MHz), ASKAP-low (887.5 MHz), and MGCLS (1284 MHz) images, we detect complex, filamentary diffuse emission with a largest linear extent of 521 kpc. This emission originates from the cluster center and extends westward, confined within the X-ray-emitting intra-cluster medium (ICM). Chandra X-ray data confirm that Abell 13 is undergoing a merger, and the radio morphology reflects signatures of this ongoing dynamical activity. We observed filamentary structures extending towards east-northeast and southwest directions. The spectral index across the emission appears irregular and lacks a coherent spatial gradient. The integrated spectrum reveals a steep spectral index of -1.85 +/- 0.05 and a spectral curvature of -0.93 +/- 0.21. These spectral properties, along with the observed morphology and brightness distribution, are consistent with a re-energization of a fossil radio plasma driven by adiabatic compression, supporting the classification of the emission as a radio phoenix.",

Our aim is to assess whether the preference for late-time dynamics and phantom divide line (PDL) crossing persists when early-time physics is introduced, and whether these combined models improve the alleviation of the Hubble tension compared to the varying-$m_e$ extension alone. Using the latest CMB, BAO, and supernova datasets, we derive updated constraints on $\\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and their extensions, and examine their impact on $H_0$ and the preference for late-time dynamics. We find that $\\Lambda$CDM+$m_e$ yields the largest upward shift in $H_0$, while replacing $\\Lambda$ with the CPL parametrization or its non-crossing variants provides modest improvements in the overall fit. The data consistently favour dynamical dark energy and a phantom divide line crossing at scale factors $a_{\\rm c}\\simeq0.6-0.9$, and these preferences remain robust, though somewhat weaker ($\\gtrsim2\\sigma$), when the electron mass is also allowed to vary. Among the late-time models, CPL performs better than its non-crossing variants, further reinforcing the evidence for a genuine phantom divide crossing. The alleviation of the $H_0$ tension in the varying-$m_e$ case arises from late-time data breaking the strong $\\Omega_m$-$m_e$ degeneracy in the CMB, while the additional degrees of freedom in CPL models allow the late-time dynamics to absorb this impact, thereby weakening the degeneracy breaking and further lowering $H_0$ through their ability to yield a decreasing dark energy contribution.",

In this paper, we propose a novel method to constrain the parameter space of ALPs by investigating the resulting imprints of axion-photon conversion in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. We show that a helical magnetic field existing prior to the CMB epoch can generate an excess population of photons carrying net circular polarization due to the axion-photon conversion mechanism. Consequently, current measurements of the angular power spectrum of circular polarization ($V$-mode) in the CMB can be used to constrain the parameter space of ALP mass and its coupling to photons. In the optimistic scenario of a maximally helical magnetic field with strength $\\sim {\\rm nG}$, we find that CLASS observations at $40 \\, {\\rm GHz}$ can probe the previously unconstrained regions of axion-photon coupling corresponding to ALP masses in the range $10^{-10}-10^{-8} \\, {\\rm eV}$.",

Department of Physics, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong SAR, China Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Recent pulsar timing array results, including the NANOGrav 15-year data set, show evidence for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB) in the nanohertz band. We present a Bayesian framework to compare three possible origins: (i) a background from supermassive black hole binary mergers, (ii) a first-order phase transition in the early Universe, and (iii) a network of cosmic strings. We derive the PTA likelihood with the Hellings-Downs angular correlation and model intrinsic pulsar red noise and dispersion-measure variations. Using Bayesian model selection, we infer posteriors for the GWB amplitude and spectral slope and compute marginal likelihoods for each scenario. We confirm a common-spectrum process with Hellings-Downs spatial correlations and recover a characteristic strain amplitude at f_yr = 1/year of A_GWB approx 2.4e-15, with a slope consistent with gamma approx 13/3 as expected for supermassive black hole binaries. While fully consistent with an astrophysical origin, cosmological sources are not excluded: cosmic strings with Gmu ~ 1e-11 to 1e-10 and phase transitions peaking near 1e-8 to 1e-7 Hz can reproduce the observed amplitude within allowed parameter ranges. Current Bayes factors do not show a decisive preference among these scenarios. We discuss noise-mitigation implications and prospects for discrimination with future PTA observations.",

Besides, we compare the impacts of different SNe Ia datasets (PantheonPlus and DESY5) and BAO datasets (DESI-DR2 and BOSS-DR12) on the constraints of the cosmological models. By employing Bayesian evidence and other model selection criteria, we find that the choice of SNe Ia and BAO datasets can significantly influence the inferred preference for cosmological models.

Vásquez-Bustos Accepted in A&A, 12 pages plus appendix, five figures, two tables Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) In a hierarchical $\\Lambda$CDM Universe, cosmic filaments serve as the primary channels for matter accretion into galaxy clusters, influencing the shape of their dark matter halos. We investigate whether the elongation of galaxy clusters correlates with the orientation of surrounding filaments, providing the first observational test of this relationship in large supercluster regions. We identified and characterized cosmic filaments in two dimensions within the two superclusters that are part of the low-redshift sub-survey of the Chilean Cluster Galaxy Evolution Survey (CHANCES): the Shapley supercluster and the Horologium-Reticulum supercluster. We analyzed the alignment between filament directions --traced by galaxy distributions- and the triaxiality of cluster gravitational potentials --traced by X-ray emission- using publicly available optical and X-ray data. We have found that most (82%) of the X-ray clusters are associated with and interconnected by the optically detected filaments. The clusters-filaments alignment analysis shows that the elongation of most clusters is well aligned with nearby filaments, providing observational confirmation of theoretical predictions, with the alignment progressively reducing at larger cluster-centric distances ($> 1.6 r_{200}$). Overall, our results support the notion that filaments are the main source of galaxy accretion at redshift below 0.1 and additionally provide evidence that matter accretion through filaments shapes the gravitational potential of galaxy clusters. We propose this measurement as a simple observational proxy to determine the direction of accretion in clusters, which is key to understanding both galaxy evolution and the merger history of galaxy clusters.",

Del Popolo, Saeed Fakhry, Maryam Shiravand, Morgan Le Delliou Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) In this study, we build upon the findings of Del Popolo et al. (2013) by further analyzing the influence of dynamical friction on the evolution of cosmological perturbations within the framework of the spherical collapse model (SCM) in a Universe dominated by generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG). Specifically, we investigate how dynamical friction alters the growth rate of density perturbations, the effective sound speed, the equation-of-state parameter www, and the evolution of the cosmic expansion rate. Our results demonstrate that dynamical friction significantly delays the collapse process compared to the standard SCM. Accurate computation of these parameters is crucial for obtaining consistent results and reliable physical interpretations when employing the GCG model. Furthermore, our analysis confirms that the suppression of perturbation growth due to dynamical friction is considerably more pronounced than that caused by shear and rotation, as previously indicated by Del Popolo et al. (2013). This enhanced suppression effectively addresses the instability issues, such as oscillations or exponential divergences in the dark-matter power spectrum, highlighted in linear perturbation studies, such as those by Sandvik et al. (2004).",

Deep ground-based follow-up observations resolves four images of the supernova with ~1.7\" angular separation from the main lens galaxy, each coincident with the lensed images of a background galaxy seen in archival imaging of the field. Spectroscopy of the brightest point image shows narrow features matching absorption lines at a redshift of z = 2.011 and broad features matching those seen in superluminous SNe with Far-UV coverage. We infer a magnification factor of 20 to 50 for the brightest image in the system, based on photometric and spectroscopic comparisons to other SLSNe-I. SN 2025wny demonstrates that gravitationally-lensed SNe are in reach of ground-based facilities out to redshifts far higher than what has been previously assumed, and provide a unique window into studying distant supernovae, internal properties of dwarf galaxies, as well as for time-delay cosmography.",

Walker Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) This work is part of a series establishing the redshift framework for the $3\\times2$pt analysis of the Dark Energy Survey Year 6 (DES Y6). For DES Y6, photometric redshift distributions are estimated using self-organizing maps (SOMs), calibrated with spectroscopic and many-band photometric data. To overcome limitations from color-redshift degeneracies and incomplete spectroscopic coverage, we enhance this approach by incorporating clustering-based redshift constraints (clustering-z, or WZ) from angular cross-correlations with BOSS and eBOSS galaxies, and eBOSS quasar samples. We define a WZ likelihood and apply importance sampling to a large ensemble of SOM-derived $n(z)$ realizations, selecting those consistent with the clustering measurements to produce a posterior sample for each lens and source bin. The analysis uses angular scales of 1.5-5 Mpc to optimize signal-to-noise while mitigating modeling uncertainties, and marginalizes over redshift-dependent galaxy bias and other systematics informed by the N-body simulation Cardinal. While a sparser spectroscopic reference sample limits WZ constraining power at $z>1.1$, particularly for source bins, we demonstrate that combining SOMPZ with WZ improves redshift accuracy and enhances the overall cosmological constraining power of DES Y6. We estimate an improvement in $S_8$ of approximately 10\\% for cosmic shear and $3\\times2$pt analysis, primarily due to the WZ calibration of the source samples.",

Wiseman (DES Collaboration) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Determining the distribution of redshifts for galaxies in wide-field photometric surveys is essential for robust cosmological studies of weak gravitational lensing. We present the methodology, calibrated redshift distributions, and uncertainties of the final Dark Energy Survey Year 6 (Y6) weak lensing galaxy data, divided into four redshift bins centered at $\\langle z \\rangle = [0.414, 0.538, 0.846, 1.157]$. We combine independent information from two methods on the full shape of redshift distributions: optical and near-infrared photometry within an improved Self-Organizing Map $p(z)$ (SOMPZ) framework, and cross-correlations with spectroscopic galaxy clustering measurements (WZ), which we demonstrate to be consistent both in terms of the redshift calibration itself and in terms of resulting cosmological constraints within 0.1$\\sigma$. We describe the process used to produce an ensemble of redshift distributions that account for several known sources of uncertainty. Among these, imperfection in the calibration sample due to the lack of faint, representative spectra is the dominant factor. The final uncertainty on mean redshift in each bin is $\\sigma_{\\langle z\\rangle} = [0.012, 0.008,0.009, 0.024]$. We ensure the robustness of the redshift distributions by leveraging new image simulations and a cross-check with galaxy shape information via the shear ratio (SR) method.",

Submitted to A&A Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a stack of data from the second season of the CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder on the positions of quasars from eBOSS and DESI. COMAP is a Line Intensity Mapping (LIM) experiment targeting dense molecular gas via CO(1--0) emission at $z\\sim3$. COMAP's Season 2 represents a $3\\times$ increase in map-level sensitivity over the previous Early Science data release. We do not detect any CO emission in the stack, instead finding an upper limit of $10.0\\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{K\\ km\\ s^{-1}\\ pc^2}$ at 95\\% confidence within an $\\sim 18\\ \\mathrm{cMpc}$ box. We compare this upper limit to models of the CO emission stacked on quasars and find a tentative ($\\sim 3 \\sigma$) tension between the limit and the brightest stack models after accounting for a suite of additional sources of experimental attenuation and uncertainty, including quasar velocity uncertainty, pipeline signal loss, cosmic variance, and interloper emission in the LIM data. The COMAP-eBOSS/DESI stack is primarily a measurement of the CO luminosity in the quasars' wider environment and is therefore potentially subject to environmental effects such as feedback. With our current simple models of the galaxy-halo connection, we are thus unable to confidently rule out any models of cosmic CO with the stack alone. Conversely, the stack's sensitivity to these large-scale environmental effects has the potential to make it a powerful tool for galaxy formation science, once we are able to constrain the average CO luminosity via the auto power spectrum (a key goal of COMAP).",

Comments welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Cosmological studies of the Lyman-Alpha (Lya) forest typically constrain parameters using two-point statistics. However, higher-order statistics, such as the three-point function (or its Fourier counterpart, the bispectrum) offer additional information and help break the degeneracy between the mean flux and power spectrum amplitude, albeit at a significant computational cost. To address this, we extend an existing highly informative compression of the bispectrum, the skew spectra, to the Lya forest. We derive the tree-level bispectrum of Lya forest fluctuations in the framework of effective field theory (EFT) directly in redshift space and validate our methodology on synthetic Lya forest data. We measure the anisotropic cross-spectra between the transmitted flux fraction and all quadratic operators arising in the bispectrum, yielding a set of 26 skew spectra. Using idealized 3D Gaussian smoothing (R=10 Mpc/h), we find good agreement (1-2 sigma level based on the statistical errors of the mocks) with the theoretical tree-level bispectrum prediction for monopole and quadrupole up to k <= 0.17 h/Mpc. To enable the cosmological analysis of Lya forest data from the currently observing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), where we cannot do 3D smoothing, we use a line-of-sight smoothing and introduce a new statistic, the shifted skew spectra. These probe non-squeezed bispectrum triangles and avoid locally applying quadratic operators to the field by displacing one copy of the field in the radial direction. Using a fixed displacement of 40 Mpc/h (and line-of-sight smoothing of 10 Mpc/h) yields a similar agreement with the theory prediction. For the special case of correlating the squared (and displaced) field with the original one, we analytically forward model the window function making this approach readily applicable to DESI data.",

This distribution has been inferred from simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies, but such models serve only as proxies given that no simulation directly captures the detailed evolution of our own Galaxy. This motivates alternative approaches which obtain this distribution directly from observations. In this work, we utilize 98 Milky Way analogues from the IllustrisTNG50 simulation to develop and validate a procedure for inferring the dark matter speed distribution using the kinematics of nearby stars. We find that the dark matter that originated from old mergers, plus that from recent non-luminous accretions, is well described by a Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution centered at the local standard-of-rest velocity. Meanwhile, recently accreted dark matter from massive mergers has speeds that can be traced from the associated stellar debris of these events. The stellar populations systematically underestimate the velocity dispersion of their dark matter counterparts, but a simple kinematic boost brings the two into good alignment. Using the TNG50 host galaxies, we demonstrate that combining these two contributions provides an accurate reconstruction of the local dark matter speeds. As an application of the procedure to our own Galaxy, we utilize stellar kinematic data from Gaia to quantify how the dark matter remnants from the Milky Way's last major merger impact its speed distribution in the Solar neighborhood.",

We model binaries embedded in a self-gravitating circumbinary disc that evolves following an adiabatic equation of state, including viscous heating and black-body cooling. Focusing on binaries with a total mass of $10^6 \\, M_{\\odot}$, eccentricities $e=0,0.45,0.9$ and mass ratios $q=1, 0.7$, we find that radiation pressure significantly affects both the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and the light curves (LCs). The emission from the mini-discs shifts from the optical towards UV frequencies and with a peak luminosity orders of magnitude higher, while the circumbinary disc becomes colder and dimmer as a result of its geometrically thinner configuration. Temporal variability is affected as well: near UV and soft-X ray fluxes are higher and more variable. Crucially, radiation pressure suppresses the characteristic \"lump\" formation in equal-mass circular systems, while a lump is formed for higher eccentricities without imprinting any modulation on the flux. In the circular case we still find a modulation on the cavity edge timescale at a frequency $0.36 \\, f_{\\rm K}$, while in eccentric binaries, only robust orbital period modulations ($f=1,2 \\, f_{\\rm K}$) are observed, with no modulation associated with the cavity orbital motion. Moreover, the enhanced emission from the mini-discs and streams due to radiation pressure, one redshifted, results in brighter flux in the optical G band, proving detectability of MBHBs signatures even at higher redshift ($z=0.6-1.0$). Our results reveal that radiation pressure plays a crucial role in shaping MBHBs spectral and time-domain features, with implications for their identification in time-domain surveys.",

Thesis, LMU and MPA, July 2025, 182 pages Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) This thesis investigates the Epoch of Cosmic Reionization (EoR), a key period in the early Universe when the first luminous sources formed and their radiation transformed the intergalactic medium (IGM) from neutral to ionized. Understanding this process reveals how the first stars and galaxies formed, influenced their surroundings, and shaped large-scale structures. The work traces both hydrogen and helium reionization by identifying the sources that produced ionizing radiation and examining how this radiation affected the thermal and ionization history of the IGM. Using the SPICE cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, the first part analyzes the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) of high-redshift galaxies. It shows that different supernova feedback models drive distinct UVLF variability across mass and redshift, potentially alleviating the bright-galaxy tension seen by JWST. The second part explores how spectra from ionizing sources i.e. single and binary stars, X-ray binaries, emission from the interstellar medium, and active galactic nuclei impact the timing, topology, and thermal history of hydrogen reionization and the Lyman-alpha forest. At lower redshifts, radiative-transfer simulations reveal how helium reionization driven by quasars progressed and how the timing and temperature of the IGM relate to quasar luminosity functions and He II Ly-alpha observations. Finally, predictions for the 3.5 cm hyperfine transition of singly ionized helium-3 offer a novel probe of the post-reionization IGM. Together, these studies combine galaxy formation, radiative processes, and IGM evolution to provide a coherent picture of cosmic reionization and its observable signatures.",

The RGC model integrates the self-supervised framework BYOL (Bootstrap YOur Latent) with the supervised E2CNN (E2-equivariant Convolutional Neural Network) to form a semi-supervised binary classifier. The RGC model, when trained and evaluated on a dataset devoid of spurious sources, reaches peak performance, attaining an accuracy of 88.88% along with F1-scores of 0.90 for WATs and 0.85 for NATs.

Rajohnson Accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The relationship between the already formed stellar mass in a galaxy and the gas reservoir of neutral atomic hydrogen, is a key element in our understanding of how gas is turned into stars in galaxy haloes. In this paper, we measure the $M_{\\rm HI}-M_{\\star}$ relation based on a stellar-mass selected sample at $0.25 < z < 0.5$ and the MIGHTEE-HI DR1 spectral data. Using a powerful Bayesian stacking technique, for the first time we are also able to measure the underlying bivariate distribution of HI mass and stellar mass of galaxies with $M_\\star > 10^{9.5}$ M$_{\\odot}$, finding that an asymmetric underlying HI distribution is strongly preferred by our complete samples. We define the concepts of the average of the logarithmic HI mass, $\\langle\\log_{10}(M_{\\rm HI})\\rangle$, and the logarithmic average of the HI mass, $\\log_{10}(\\langle M_{\\rm HI}\\rangle)$, and find that the difference between $\\langle\\log_{10}(M_{\\rm HI})\\rangle$ and $\\log_{10}(\\langle M_{\\rm HI}\\rangle)$ can be as large as $\\sim$0.5 dex for the preferred asymmetric HI distribution. We observe shallow slopes in the underlying $M_{\\rm HI}-M_{\\star}$ scaling relations, suggesting the presence of an upper HI mass limit beyond which a galaxy can no longer retain further HI gas. From our bivariate distribution we also infer the HI mass function at this redshift and find tentative evidence for a decrease of 2-10 times in the co-moving space density of the most HI massive galaxies up to $z\\sim 0.5$.",

Smith, Debora Sijacki, Martin A. Bourne, Sophie Koudmani 20 pages, 10 figures, submitted to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present a suite of high-resolution simulations to study how different stellar feedback channels regulate the growth of central intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in dwarf galaxies hosting nuclear star clusters (NSCs). We employ a super-Lagrangian refinement scheme to resolve the self-gravity radius of the $\\alpha$-accretion disc ($<0.01$~pc) and follow the gas inflows from the interstellar medium (ISM) to the black hole (BH), allowing for the self-consistent emergence of circumnuclear discs (CNDs). In the absence of stellar feedback, as expected, the galactic disc fragments excessively, producing a massive CND. When radiative stellar feedback is included, fragmentation is suppressed, with even more massive CNDs forming and feeding the IMBH. With supernova (SN) feedback only, clustered SNe strongly heat the ISM, yielding both the lowest CND masses and BH accretion rates. When both radiative stellar feedback and SNe are included, the CND becomes intermittent: it survives for $10$--$100$~Myr, and is then destroyed by feedback before being replenished by fresh galactic inflows, while substantial BH growth still takes place. These results highlight the critical importance of accurately modelling the combined effects of key stellar feedback processes to understand IMBH growth. Our simulation suite brackets the likely range of CND states, with IMBHs exhibiting significant growth and systematic spin-up in all dwarf galaxy models explored. These findings bode well for the detection of IMBHs with future observational facilities such as SKA, the Rubin Observatory, and LISA, and make them highly relevant progenitor candidates of the high-redshift supermassive BHs observed by JWST.",

D 112, 083520 (2025) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) This paper investigates the thermodynamic evolution of the universe within the framework of a quadratic equation of state (EoS). Building upon the basis of the quadratic EoS model, as a phenomenological extension to dark energy models, we analyze the implications for cosmic dynamics, including energy density evolution of effective dark matter and dark energy, entropy behavior, and convexity stability conditions. Our approach emphasizes the significance of thermodynamic principles in understanding the late-time acceleration and the crossing of the phantom divide, providing a cohesive description consistent with recent observational data. Moreover, we demonstrate that the $\\Lambda$CDM model, regardless of entropy additivity, violates the convexity condition, while the quadratic model aligns with maximum entropy and may prevent a \\textit{Big Rip} scenario.",

Despite the selection effect, theoretical templates in most analyses assume single tracers when compared with the measured clustering quantities. We demonstrate analytically that the selection effect inevitably introduces a bias in the redshift-space power spectrum on scales from linear to nonlinear scales. To quantitatively assess the impact of the selection effect, we construct mock galaxy catalogs from halos in N-body simulations by selecting halos above redshift-dependent mass thresholds such that the resulting redshift distribution of the halos, $n(z)$, matches that of SDSS-like galaxies. We find that the selection effect causes fractional changes of up to only 1% and 2% in the monopole and quadrupole moments of the redshift-space power spectrum at $k\\lesssim 0.3~h{\\rm{Mpc}}^{-1}$, respectively, compared to the moments for the single mass-threshold (therefore single tracer) sample, for $n_{\\rm g}(z)$ of the SDSS-like galaxy samples. We also argue that the selection effect is unlikely to cause a significant bias in the estimation of cosmological parameters using the Fisher matrix method, provided that the redshift-dependent selection effect is modest.",

The LCS can, in principle, constrain the reionization model and history by quantifying the morphology of neutral hydrogen\\,(\\HI) distribution during the different stages of the EoR. Specifically, the percolation transition of ionized regions, quantified and constrained via LCS, provides a crucial insight about the underlying reionization model. The previous LCS analysis of EoR 21\\,cm maps demonstrates that the convolution of the synthesized beam of the radio interferometric arrays, e.g. SKA1-Low with the target signal, shifts the apparent percolation transition of ionized regions towards the lower redshifts. In this study, we present an optimal thresholding strategy to reduce this bias in the recovered percolation transition. We assess the robustness of LCS analysis of the 21\\,cm maps, considering the effects of antenna-based gain calibration errors and instrumental noise for SKA1-Low. This analysis is performed using synthetic observations simulated by the \\textsc{21cmE2E} pipeline, considering SKA1-Low AA4 configuration within a radius of 2\\,km from the array centre. Our findings suggest that a minimum of $2000$\\,hours of observation (SNR $\\gtrapprox 3$) are required for the LCS analysis to credibly suppress the confusion introduced by thermal noise. Further, we also demonstrate that for a maximum antenna-based calibration error tolerance of $\\sim 0.02\\%$ (post calibration), the reionization history can be recovered in a robust and relatively unbiased manner using the LCS.",

Cosmic voids are vast underdense regions in the cosmic web that encode crucial information about structure formation, the composition of the Universe, and its expansion history. Due to their lower density, these regions are less affected by non-linear gravitational dynamics, making them suitable candidates for analysis using semi-analytic methods. Aims. We assess the accuracy of the PINOCCHIO code, a fast tool for generating dark matter halo catalogs based on Lagrangian Perturbation Theory, in modeling the statistical properties of cosmic voids. We validate this approach by comparing the resulting void statistics measured from PINOCCHIO to those obtained from N-body simulations. Methods. We generate a set of simulations using PINOCCHIO and OpenGADGET3, assuming a fiducial cosmology and varying the resolution. For a given resolution, the simulations share the same initial conditions between the different simulation codes. Snapshots are saved at multiple redshifts for each simulation and post-processed using the watershed void finder VIDE to identify cosmic voids. For each simulation code, we measure the following statistics: void size function, void ellipticity function, core density function, and the void radial density profile. We use these statistics to quantify the accuracy of PINOCCHIO relative to OpenGADGET3 in the context of cosmic voids. Results. We find agreement for all void statistics at better than 2{\\sigma} between PINOCCHIO and OpenGADGET3, with no systematic difference in redshift trends. This demonstrates that the PINOCCHIO code can reliably produce void statistics with high computational efficiency compared to full N-body simulations.",

Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) DES-5Y supernovae, combined with DESI BAO, appear to favour Chevallier-Polarski-Linder $(w_0, w_a)$ dynamical dark energy over $\\Lambda$CDM. arXiv:2408.07175 suggested that this is driven by a systematic in the DES pipeline, which particularly affects the low-redshift supernovae brought in from legacy surveys. It is difficult to investigate these data in isolation, however, as the complicated supernovae pipelines must properly account for selection effects. In this work, we discover that the Bayesian evidence previously found for flexknot dark energy (arXiv:2503.17342) is beaten by a magnitude offset between the low- and high-redshift supernovae. In addition, we find that the possible tension between DES-5Y and DESI is significantly reduced by such an offset. We also take the opportunity to trial Nested Bridge Sampling with Sequential Monte Carlo as an alternative method for calculating Bayes factors.",

Winther Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Cosmological models where dark matter interacts with dark energy via a pure momentum transfer and with no energy exchange (i.e. elastic) provide compelling scenarios for addressing the apparent lack of structures at low redshift. In particular, it has been shown that measurements of $S_8$ may show a statistically significant preference for the presence of elastic interactions. In this work we implement a specific realisation of these scenarios into an $N$-body code to explore the non-linear regime. We include two populations of particles to describe the interacting dark matter and the non-interacting baryons respectively. On linear scales we recover the suppression of structures obtained from Boltzmann codes, while non-linear scales exhibit an enhancement of the matter power. We find that fewer massive halos are formed at low redshift as a consequence of the elastic interaction and that dark matter halos are more compact than in the standard model. Furthermore, the ratio of dark matter and baryons density profiles is not constant. Finally, we corroborate that baryons efficiently cluster around dark matter halos so they provide good tracers of the dark matter velocity field despite the presence of the interaction. This shows that the interaction is not sufficiently strong as to disrupt virialised structures.",

Comments are welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Current and future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments aim to achieve high-precision reconstruction of the CMB polarization signal, with the most ambitious objective being the detection of primordial $B$ modes sourced by cosmic inflation. Given the expected low amplitude of the signal, its estimate-parametrized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$-is highly susceptible to contamination from Galactic foreground residuals that remain after component separation. In this work, we introduce a model-independent procedure to construct a spectral template of residual foreground contamination in the observed angular power spectrum. Specifically, a cleaned multifrequency set of foreground-emission maps is blindly reconstructed from the observed data using the Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (GNILC) technique. These maps are then combined with the weights adopted for CMB reconstruction, yielding an estimate of the spatial distribution of foreground residuals after component separation. The power spectrum of this estimated residual map is incorporated into the spectral model of the cosmological likelihood. We validate the proposed method using realistic simulations of a LiteBIRD-like experiment processed with two Internal Linear Combination (ILC) component-separation techniques, focusing on constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. When the foreground contribution is not included in the model, the resulting $r$ posteriors are biased, irrespective of its input value, the assumed foreground model, or the adopted masking strategy. Conversely, when the residual template is included in the likelihood, the analysis yields unbiased estimates of $r$ for all considered cases, thereby demonstrating the robustness of the proposed procedure.

The simulations combine on-the-fly radiative transfer with a detailed non-equilibrium thermochemical network (81 ions and molecules), resolving the cold and warm gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) on spatial scales down to 20 pc and on average 200 pc at cosmic noon. Comparing our full non-equilibrium calculation with local radiation to traditional post-processed photoionization equilibrium (PIE) models assuming a uniform UV background (UVB), we find that non-equilibrium physics and local radiation fields fundamentally impact the thermochemistry of the CGM. Recombination lags and local radiation anisotropy shift ions away from their PIE+UVB values and modify covering fractions (for example, HI damped Ly$\\alpha$ absorbers differ by up to 40%). In addition, a resolution study with cooling-length refinement allows us to double the resolution in the cold and warm CGM gas, reaching 120 pc on average. When refining on cooling length, the mass of the lightest cold clumps decreases tenfold to $\\approx 10^4\\,M_\\odot$, their boundary layers develop sharper ion stratification, and the warm gas is better resolved, boosting the abundance of warm gas tracers such as CIV and OIII. Together, these results demonstrate that non-equilibrium thermochemistry coupled to radiative transfer, combined with physically motivated resolution criteria, is essential to predict circumgalactic absorption and emission signatures and to guide the design of targeted observations with existing and upcoming facilities.",

Ingallinera submitted to A&A, comments are welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) When a supernova remnant (SNR) interacts with the dense material of an interstellar cloud, its shock wave decelerates rapidly, and the post-shock temperature drops to levels that permit efficient cooling of the shocked plasma. At this stage, the shock enters the post-adiabatic phase of its evolution. During this phase, the internal structure of the SNR undergoes significant changes, particularly in the immediate post-shock region, at spatial scales relevant to cosmic ray acceleration. Once the shock enters the post-adiabatic regime, the efficiency of diffusive shock acceleration increases due to a higher plasma compression, to a change in the direction of the advection velocity, and to an increased rate of momentum gain. As a result, the momentum spectrum of relativistic particles hardens, deviating from a pure power law at high energies. Particles could reach higher maximum values compared to classical predictions. We highlight the dynamics of post-adiabatic flows in SNRs, study their impact on particle acceleration, and present supporting observational evidence in the radio band.",

However, the recently discovered QPEs in ZTF19acnskyy (\"Ansky\") appear to be linked to an active galactic nucleus (AGN) rather than a TDE, as their slow decay and AGN-like variability differ markedly from that of typical TDEs. This finding may imply broader formation channels for QPEs. To further investigate Ansky's nature, we obtained a timely ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, which reveals a featureless, TDE-like spectrum devoid of broad optical or UV emission lines. Additionally, the steep UV continuum, fitted by a power law with an index of -2.6, aligns more closely with TDEs than with AGNs. Compared to other featureless TDEs, Ansky exhibits a significantly lower blackbody luminosity (10^43 erg s^-1) and much longer rise and decay timescales, suggesting a distinct TDE subclass. An offset TDE involving an intermediate-mass black hole is unlikely, given its position consistent with the galactic center with a 3 sigma upper limit of 54 pc. Instead, we propose that Ansky may result from the tidal disruption of a post-main-sequence star by a typical supermassive black hole. Our findings strengthen the growing evidence for TDE-QPE associations, although other formation channels for QPEs remain plausible and await future observational efforts.",

However, in the current era of time-critical, multi-wavelength, and multi-messenger astronomy, rapid and reliable classification is essential to enable timely follow-up and coordinated observations. In this work, we develop and present two deep learning-based classifiers that integrate convolutional and recurrent neural network architectures. Using multivariate time-series inputs derived from Fermi-GBM data, our models are trained to distinguish among four classes of gamma-ray transients: Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs), Solar Flares (SFLAREs), and Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs). Furthermore, the models are designed to flag events that do not conform to any of these categories, providing a pathway for identifying potentially new or rare transient types. Training was conducted using a carefully curated subset of high-confidence Fermi events. The resulting models achieve an overall classification accuracy of 93%, and identify approximately 2.5% of the triggers as outliers of unknown origin. When applied to Fermi events with uncertain classifications, our models assign 60% of them to the TGF category with over 60% confidence. These results demonstrate that incorporating deep learning-based classification into onboard or automated data pipelines can significantly enhance transient identification, minimize misclassification, and improve the discovery potential of new phenomena in future high-energy astrophysics missions.",

Hill High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a detailed analysis of the X-ray emission of the Compton-thick (CT) AGN ESO 137-G034 based on deep ($\\sim230$ ks) Chandra observations. As in other CT AGNs, the morphology of the emission is elongated, approximately following the [O III] ionization bicone. With spatially resolved spectral modeling, we show that the extended emission within the bi-cone regions { is most readily explained} as from a mixture of photo-ionized gas and shock-heated plasma, reflecting the combined effects of radiative and kinematic AGN feedback. By comparing the morphology of the { X-ray emission in narrow spectral bands and that of the 3 cm radio jet, we find suggestive evidence of thermal, possibly shocked emission associated with the SE termination of the radio jet. This interpretation is also supported by the lack of [O III] relative to the $0.3-3.0$ keV flux in the inner $3^{\\prime\\prime}$ ($\\sim600$ pc) of the SE cone, which would be consistent with an additional thermal X-ray component on top of the photonized emission of an outflowing wind. A similar effect is only seen within the inner $1^{\\prime\\prime}$ ($200$ pc) of the NW cone. In the radial profile of the [OIII]/X-ray flux ratio and the X-ray hardness ratio within the inner $\\sim3^{\\prime\\prime}$ ($\\sim600$ pc) of the SE cone we see an asymmetry, with no counterpart in the NW cone. We detect soft extended X-ray emission in the cross-cones which may originate from the interaction of an embedded radio jet with a clumpy interstellar medium (ISM). }These results highlight the { importance of both} radiative and mechanical feedback in shaping the circumnuclear environment of ESO 137-G034.",

Our results indicate that a detection significance of about 5-sigma can be achieved with approximately 30 hours of observation.

Comments and Feedbacks are wellcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We presented the multi-wavelength afterglow fitting results for three events that exhibit late afterglow re-brightening behavior: EP240414a ($z=0.402$), GRB 240529A ($z=2.695$), and GRB 240218A ($z=6.782$), which span a broad range of redshifts, from the local to the high-redshift universe. We prove that the peculiar afterglow light curves of three bursts can be well fitted by structured jets propagated in free-to-shocked stellar wind environment of stellar wind blown bubbles. This scenario offers a self-consistent explanation for the observed subclass of afterglows that exhibit rebrightening that characterized by steep rises and rapid decays. It also provides a unified solution for such events and offers pathways to study both the jet generation mechanism and the propagation process of jets through the envelope of progenitor. This study reveals that the structured jets produced by such events exhibit a narrow jet core and a steep angle-dependent energy decay index, suggesting highly magnetized jets. The derived transition radii from free stellar winds to shocked stellar winds for all three events are smaller than 0.5 pc, with statistical analysis of similar events indicating a median value of 0.1 pc, which conflicts with numerical simulation results. We anticipate that future observations by EP/SVOM missions will enhance the understanding of analogous events and further reveil information about progenitors and the circum-environments.",

We highlight the first timing solutions, pulse profiles, flux densities, and polarization measurements at 820 MHz for PSR J0535-0231, with a spin period of 415 ms, and PSR J1816-0518, with a spin period of 1.93 s, from a year-long follow-up campaign. PSR J0535-0231 appears to be partially recycled, but isolated, and likely belongs to the class of disrupted recycled pulsars (DRPs). We find that the two widely used electron density models, NE2001 and YMW16, both fall short of accurately modeling the line-of-sight to PSR J0535-0231, as the maximum dispersion measure (DM) predicted by both models is lower than the pulsar's DM of 117.6 pc cm$^{-3}$. Finally, we place both pulsar discoveries in the context of other FAST pulsars discovered in the CRAFTS survey and of the currently known pulsar population, in general, and discuss ways in which future FAST discoveries of faint, distant pulsars might facilitate the development of improved versions of the aforementioned electron density models in certain regions of our Galaxy.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The physical origin of prompt emission in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains an open question since it has been studied more than half a century. Three alternative models (i.e. dissipative photosphere, internal shock, and ICMART) have been proposed to interpret the observations of GRB prompt emission, but none of them can fully interpret all of the observational data collected so far. The question is that what is the fraction of these three theoretical models in the prompt emission of GRB, respectively. In this paper, we propose to utilize an innovative method, and constrain the fraction of GRB prompt emission models via its non-detected diffuse neutrinos. By adopting two methods (e.g., summing up the individual GRB contributions and assumed luminosity functions of GRB) to calculate diffuse neutrino flux of GRBs for given the benchmark parameters of $\\Gamma=300$ and $\\varepsilon_{p} \\text{/} \\varepsilon_{e}=10$, both approaches indicate that most GRBs should be originated from the ICMART model. Moreover, we find that the fractions of the dissipative photosphere model, the internal shock model, and the ICMART model are constrained to be [0, $0.5\\%$], [0, $1.1\\%$], and [$98.9\\%$, 1], respectively for the method of summing up the individual GRB contributions. For the method of luminosity functions, the fractions of above three models are constrained to be [0, $6.1\\%$], [0, $8.2\\%$], and [$91.8\\%$, 1], respectively. However, such fractions of different models are also dependent on the parameters of $\\Gamma$ and $\\varepsilon_{p} \\text{/} \\varepsilon_{e}$.",

We modeled the first peak with a semianalytical shock-cooling model and the X-ray emission with a free-free model. We compare the envelope radius and mass-loss rate with other Type IIb SNe to explore the relationships between the progenitor envelope and the circumstellar material (CSM). The shock-cooling peak in the $V$-band light curve reached $M_V = -17.33\\pm 0.26$mag, while the $^{56}$Ni-powered second peak attained $M_V = -17.43\\pm 0.26$mag. Early spectra show an photospheric velocity of $\\sim19,400\\,km\\,s^{-1}$ at 3.82days from the H$\\alpha$ P~Cygni profile. The Balmer lines persist at least +87 days after the explosion, characterizing hydrogen-rich ejecta. Modeling the first light-curve peak suggests an extended envelope with a mass of $0.11\\pm0.04\\,M_{\\odot}$ and a radius of $244\\pm43~R_{\\odot}$. Fitting the second light-curve peak with an Arnett-like model indicates a typical $^{56}$Ni mass of $ 0.117\\pm0.013~M_{\\odot}$ and a relatively low ejecta mass of $1.272\\pm0.343\\,M_{\\odot}$. X-ray observations reveal bright thermal bremsstrahlung emission and indicate a mass-loss rate of $1.6\\times10^{-5}\\ M_{\\odot} \\ \\rm{yr}^{-1}$. SN 2024iss occupies a transitional position between the two subclasses of extended (eIIb) and compact (cIIb) Type IIb SNe. Its envelope radius and pre-explosion mass-loss rate appear to be correlated as theoretically predicted. The observational properties of SN 2024iss are compatible with a binary interaction scenario being the dominant mechanism for envelope stripping. Furthermore, the low column density of neutral hydrogen suggests a compact CSM with an outer radius of $\\lesssim1.3\\times10^{14}$ cm, indicating that the progenitor star experienced eruptive mass loss within $\\sim4\\,yr$ of its terminal explosion.",

In a search for supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) candidates, we carried out tests for periodic variability using generalized Lomb-Scargle (GLS), weighted wavelet-Z (WWZ), and sine-wave fitting (SWF) analyses of this sample. We used simulations to test the effects of the power law spectrum of the power spectral density (PSD) on our findings, and show that the irregular sampling in the observed light curves has very little effect on the GLS spectra. Apparent periodicities and putative harmonics appear in all 83 of the GLS spectra of the blazars in our sample. We tested the reality of these apparent periodicities and harmonics with simulations, and found that in the overwhelming majority of cases they are due to the steep slope of the PSD, and should therefore be treated with great caution. We find one new SMBHB candidate: PKS 1309+1154, which exhibits a 17.9 year periodicity. The fraction of SMBHB candidates in our sample is $2.4_{-0.8}^{+3.2}\\%$.",

Discussions are welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Very high energy (VHE) gama rays above 100 GeV are expected to undergo significant attenuation during cosmic propagation due to pair production with thr extralactic background light (EBL). However, recent observations - particulary the tentative detection of gamma ray burst GRB 221009A up to 18 TeV by LHASSO and up to 251 TeV by Carpet-2, challenge the predictions of classical EBL absorption models. These exceptionally high-energy photons suggest the possibility of new physics affecting photon propagation over cosmological distances. In this context, the gamma-ray spectrum in the tens to hundreds of TeV range serves as a valuable probe for potential Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) effects or for modifications to photon attenuation due to axion-like particles (ALPs) mixing with photons in cosmic magnetic fields. However, both LIV and ALPs explanations, when considered separately, face certain limitations in fully accounting for the observed transparency. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that combines the effects of ALPs and LIV to explain the unexpectedly high survival probability of VHE photons. Specifically, we investigate the multi-wavelength spectrum of GRB 221009A under this synergistic scenario, demonstrating that for photons at 18 TeV and 251 TeV, the combined influence of ALPs with coupling $g_{a\\gamma} = 13.353 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ and mass $m_a = 9.492 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{eV}$, together with LIV characterized by energy scales $E_1 = 2.4~E_{\\rm Planck}$ for $n = 1$ , can substantially enhance the photon survival probability. This synergy offers a compelling explanation for the observed VHE gamma-ray transparency in extreme astrophysical environments.",

Merger-novae are typically powered by the radioactive decay of heavy elements synthesized via the r-process. If the post-merger remnant is a long-lived rapid-rotating neutron star, the merger-nova can be significantly enhanced due to strong magnetized winds. In this paper, we generate mock BNS merger samples using binary population synthesis model and classify their post-merger remnants--black hole (BH) and magnetar, (i.e., long-lived supramassive NS and stable NS), based on results from numerical simulations. We then construct merger-nova radiation models to estimate their luminosity function. We find that the luminosity function may exhibit a distinctive triple-peak structure, with the relative positions and heights of these peaks depending on the equation of state (EOS) of the BNS. Furthermore, we estimate the average Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) detection efficiency $\\langle f_{\\rm eff} \\rangle$ with the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) and find that due to possible enhanced luminosity, the largest source redshift with $\\langle f_{\\rm eff} \\rangle>0.1$ can be enlarged from $z_{\\rm s}\\sim 0.5$ to $z_{\\rm s}\\sim 1-1.5$. Besides, we also generate the detectable mass spectrum for merger-novae by $\\langle f_{\\rm eff}\\rangle$, which may provide insights to the ToO searching strategy.",

This volcanic region provides a unique chronosequence of samples brought to the surface by well-dated eruptions. By modeling the expected density of nuclear recoil tracks induced by cosmic-ray muons in olivine, we show that the signal is detectable and above backgrounds from natural radioactivity. We demonstrate that by analyzing samples with different exposure ages, it is possible to construct a time-differential measurement of the cosmic-ray flux. This method shows sensitivity to historical variations, such as the enhanced flux expected during the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion ($\\sim$41~kyr) and the potential contribution from nearby supernovae, for which we use the Antlia supernova remnant precursor as a benchmark.

This is the author's accepted manuscript (AAM), prior to journal typesetting High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We present a novel method for both forecasting and recasting upper limits (ULs) on dark matter (DM) annihilation cross sections, $\\left< \\sigma v \\right>^{UL}$, or decay lifetime $\\tau^{LL}$ . The forecasting method relies solely on the instrument response functions (IRFs) to predict ULs for a given observational setup, without the need for full analysis pipelines. The recasting procedure uses published ULs to reinterpret constraints for alternative DM models or channels. We demonstrate its utility across a range of canonical annihilation channels, including $b\\bar{b}$, $W^+W^-$, $\\tau^+\\tau^-$, and $\\mu^+\\mu^-$, and apply it to several major gamma-ray experiments, including MAGIC, \\textit{Fermi}-LAT, and CTAO. Notably, we develop a recasting approach that remains effective even when the IRF is unavailable by extracting generalized IRF-dependent coefficients from benchmark channels. We apply this method to reinterpret ULs derived from standard spectra (e.g., PPPC4DMID) in terms of more recent DM scenarios, including a Higgsino-like model with mixed final states and spectra generated with the CosmiXs model. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations and direct comparison with published results confirm the robustness and accuracy of our method, with discrepancies remaining within statistical uncertainties. The algorithm is generally applicable to any scenario where the expected signal model is parametric, offering a powerful tool for reinterpreting existing gamma-ray limits and efficiently exploring the DM parameter space in current and future indirect detection experiments.",

Svinkin, Joshua Wood High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Magnetar giant flares (MGFs) are rare, extremely bright bursts of gamma-rays from highly magnetized neutron stars. These events are challenging to identify because, at extragalactic distances, they can appear similar to other astrophysical phenomena. Only a handful have been confidently identified to date, limiting our understanding of their origin and physical properties. This study focuses on expanding the sample of known events and enabling a more detailed characterization of their observational features and intrinsic properties, while introducing significant improvements in the methods used to identify and analyze them. When applied to archival data from the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on the \\Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, this approach added four previously unidentified events the known sample, expanding the total to 13 MGFs. This demonstrates both the effectiveness of the method and the likelihood that additional MGFs remain hidden in existing gamma-ray burst catalogs. We utilize this expanded sample to gain a deeper understanding of the broader population of MGFs. We develop a statistical modeling framework that combines previously considered data with modern observations from Fermi/GBM. The model accounts for instrumental sensitivity and the expected diversity in event characteristics. We infer a volumetric rate of events above $1.2\\times10^{44}\\,\\rm{erg}$ of $R_{MGF}=5.5^{+4.5}_{-2.7}\\times10^5\\rm{Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$. The results show that individual magnetars must produce multiple flares throughout their lifetimes, reinforcing the idea that these are recurring phenomena rather than singular explosive events. Expanding the sample of known MGFs improves our understanding of magnetars and their role in other astrophysical phenomena, including possible links to fast radio bursts, gravitational waves, and the creation of heavy elements in extreme astrophysical environments.",

For astroparticle physics analyses, robust and accurate reconstruction of signal parameters such as arrival direction and energy is essential. Radio detection is an established detector concept explored by many observatories; however, current reconstruction methods ignore bin-to-bin noise correlations, which limits reconstruction resolution and, so far, has prevented calculations of event-by-event uncertainties. In this work, we present a likelihood description of neutrino or cosmic-ray signals in radio detectors with correlated noise, as present in all neutrino and cosmic-ray radio detectors. We demonstrate, with simulation studies of both neutrinos and cosmic-ray radio signals, that signal parameters such as energy and direction, including event-by-event uncertainties with correct coverage, can be obtained. This method reduces reconstruction uncertainties and biases compared to previous approaches. Additionally, the Likelihood can be used for event selection and enables differentiable end-to-end detector optimization.

The aim is to observationally constrain statistical properties of flaring radiation/heating as well as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), through high time-cadence H$\\alpha$ spectroscopy. We obtained an unprecedented sample of 15 H$\\alpha$ superflares, including two blueshifted absorption, two blueshifted emission, one redshifted emission, and nine line broadening events. We obtain the following results: (1) Larger flares exhibit broader H$\\alpha$ line widths, up to 14.1$_{\\pm 2.4}$ Å, indicating higher chromospheric heating than solar flares. (2) The long-lasting redshifted event at $\\sim$100 km s$^{-1}$ may indicate dense post-flare loops. (3) H$\\alpha$ blueshifted absorptions/emissions provide evidence of massive filament/prominence eruptions, the core structures of CMEs. One newly identified event showed an unexpected rapid decrease in velocity.

These young stars frequently produce extreme magnetic explosions known as superflares, roughly once a day, potentially leading to fast and massive coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Recent research have highlighted the importance of stellar CMEs, as these events and associated particles can trigger atmospheric loss and initiate chemical reactions in planetary atmospheres. However, the observation of these associated CMEs remains largely unexplored, marking a crucial first step in assessing the particle environment. Here we present the results of 5-years multi-wavelength observations of young Sun-like stars, providing the critical clues to the common picture of solar and stellar CMEs. First, through optical spectroscopic observations, we found four of fifteen superflares are associated with fast prominence eruptions, precursors to CMEs. The stellar data greatly resemble solar counterparts, indicating a common picture of solar/stellar eruptions. Second, one of the eruptions is associated with potential coronal dimming in X-rays, indicating that the prominence eruptions evolved into stellar CMEs propagating through interplanetary space. Furthermore, the extension of solar MHD model supports the above indication and suggests that the eruption originates from the active region inferred by Zeeman Doppler Imaging and TESS light curve modeling. This comprehensive study suggests that further advancing the use of solar model could provide the first empirical inputs into calculations of atmospheric escape/chemical reactions for young planets.",

Ogilvie, Sebastien Fromang 17 pages, 18 figures. Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Many dynamical interactions can induce eccentricities in astrophysical accretion disks. Disk eccentricities in turn seed a variety of instabilities, even in ideal hydrodynamics. We use 3D nonlinear simulations and 2+1D linear calculations to characterize local and global instabilities in strongly distorted disks. On local scales, our simulations show the growth of parametrically excited inertial waves, which drive wave turbulence. The inertial waves' growth rates and localizations agree with the predictions of local theory. On global scales, we observe the growth of a separate family of low-frequency, vertically structured modes that compare favorably with eigenmodes computed from the linear theory of an eccentric background state. These low-frequency modes interact nonlinearly with the inertial wave turbulence driven by parametric instability, and they induce variation in eccentricity profiles that are initially uniform in the vertical direction. Extrapolating from our vertically local framework, we postulate that these secondary distortions may correspond to the corrugation of an initially planar eccentric disk. Our simulations demonstrate that strong disk eccentricities drive numerous dynamical phenomena even in a purely hydrodynamic, Newtonian framework.",

Trindade Falcão, P.Zhu, L.J.Kewley, R. Middei, D. Rosario, R. Davies, T. Shimizu, D. Hill Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a detailed, spatially resolved Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) analysis of ESO 137-G034, a Compton-thick Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), based on narrowband {\\it HST} imaging in [O III], [S II], H$\\alpha$, and H$\\beta$ emission lines. We dissect the Interstellar Medium (ISM) into Seyfert-, LINER-, and H II-dominated regions with a resolution of $\\sim0.1^{\\prime\\prime}$ ($\\sim20$ pc at $z=0.009$). To characterize the fine spatial structure of the { different excitation mechanism}, we introduce a new parameter: the Seyfert/LINER Index (SLI), defined as the perpendicular distance of each point in the BPT diagram from the Seyfert/LINER division line. The narrowband optical emission exhibits a bi-conical morphology and traces the diffuse X-ray emission observed with \\textit{Chandra}. Most of the emission within the bi-cones is Seyfert-like, with SLI values consistent with AGN photoionization. The North-West Seyfert cone is surrounded by a $\\sim100$--$200$ pc thick LINER cocoon with a smooth, monotonic SLI profile, shaped by either AGN wind-ISM interactions, and/or obscured AGN radiation; three radial SLI peaks suggest episodic nuclear outbursts, with estimated timescales of a few $10^3$ yrs and $<100$ yrs duration. The South-East cone shows inhomogeneous excitation, with a higher SLI region in its inner part, coinciding with a wider region of enhanced soft emission and the radio lobe inner edge. This region is characterized by line ratios consistent with fast shocks ($>1000$ km s$^{-1}$) induced excitation. The LINER cocoon in the SE cone appears more irregular, with inter-cone LINER points likely shaped by both local ISM structure and shocks. Our findings highlight the complex interplay of different AGN feedback mechanisms in the ISM.",

Motivated by the empirical correlations between X-ray and radio emission in AGN cores, we carried out a follow-up radio study in the 0.3$-$10 GHz range using GMRT (2020, 2022, 2024) and VLA (2022), and analyzed archival VLASS 3 GHz data (2017-2023) to investigate the source's radio properties and potential connection with the X-ray behavior. Our observations reveal a compact radio source with a spectral index of -0.65$\\pm$0.15 in the frequency range of 0.3$-$1.4 GHz and -1.09$\\pm$0.16 in 3$-$10 GHz. While the source was undetected in VLA-FIRST (1994) and VLASS epochs, the GMRT and VLA observations show no statistically significant variability over the monitored period. The absence of detectable changes in the radio flux, despite strong X-ray variability, suggests no direct connection between the X-ray variability and the radio emission, consistent with the Thick-Disk plus Outflow (TDO) model for WLQs. However, the sensitivity limit of the surveys prevents us from drawing definitive conclusions regarding longer timescale variability between the VLA-FIRST and GMRT epochs. We further explore possible mechanisms driving the radio emission from this source. Our analysis rules out small-scale jets and coronal emission as the primary drivers of the radio emission, suggesting that extended emission from AGN winds and star formation is the more plausible mechanism.",

Wu 19 pages, 15 figures, submitted to A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present optical observations of the Type IIb supernova (SN) 2017ckj, covering approximately 180 days after the explosion. Its early-time multi-band light curves display no clear evidence of a shock-cooling tail, resembling the behavior of SN2008ax. The $V$-band light curve exhibits a short rise time of about 5 days and reaches an absolute peak magnitude of $M_{\\rm V}=-18.58\\pm0.17\\mathrm{mag}$. The late-time multi-band light curves reveal a linear decline. We modelled the bolometric light curve of SN2017ckj to constrain the progenitor and the explosion parameters. We estimated a total mass of $\\rm ^{56}Ni$ synthesized by SN2017ckj of $M_{\\rm Ni} = 0.21^{+0.05}_{-0.03}\\ M_\\odot$, with a massive H-rich envelope of $M_{\\rm env} = 0.4^{+0.1}_{-0.1}\\ M_\\odot$. Both the $\\rm ^{56}Ni$ mass and the envelope mass of SN2017ckj are higher than those of typical SNe IIb, in agreement with its peculiar light curve evolution. The early-time spectra of SN2017ckj are dominated by a blue continuum, accompanied by narrow $\\rm H_\\alpha$ and \\Heii emission lines. The earliest spectrum exhibits flash ionization features, from which we estimated a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\\sim 3.4\\times10^{-4}M_\\odot \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. At later epochs, the spectra develop broad P-Cygni profiles and become increasingly similar to those of SNe IIb, especially SN2018gk. The late-time spectrum at around 139 days does not show a distinct decline in the strength of $\\rm H_\\alpha$ emission profile, also indicating a relatively massive envelope of its progenitor. Aside from the $\\rm H_\\alpha$ feature, the nebular spectrum exhibits prominent emission lines of \\Oi, \\Caii, [\\Caii], and \\Mgi], which are consistent with the prototypical SN1993J.",

The unprecedented size of such an array will enable measurements of cosmic rays with energies above 10$^{20}$ eV with large statistics, providing new insights into UHECR sources. With a single FAST telescope consisting of just four photomultiplier tubes, traditional techniques to reconstruct observed extensive air showers are not applicable. Instead, FAST utilises a top-down approach where simulations are directly compared to data and the best match chosen via a maximum likelihood estimation. This method, known as the \"top-down reconstruction (TDR)\", requires an accurate \"first guess\" of the shower parameters to be successful. In this work, improvements to the efficiency and precision of the TDR are made and two different first guess estimation methods are investigated. The combined performance of a machine-learning-based first guess and improved TDR is shown to achieve resolutions in the shower arrival direction, depth of shower maximum and shower energy of $\\sim2^\\circ$, $\\sim30$ g cm$^{-2}$ and $\\sim7\\%$ respectively for simulated events observed from two or more locations. The improved reconstruction is then applied to data from the current FAST prototype installations at the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array experiment. Using these results, the first measurements of the UHECR energy spectrum and composition by FAST are presented.",

They exhibit a factor of about 10 difference in brightness and, thus, a differentiation in the mass of 56Ni->56Co->56 Fe. We present a study on the fate of positrons within SNe Ia in order to evaluate their escape fractions and energy spectra. Our detailed Monte Carlo transport simulations for positrons and gamma-rays include both beta + decay of 56 Co and pair production. We simulate a wide variety of explosion scenarios, including the explosion of white dwarfs (WD) close to the Chandrasekhar mass, M(Ch), He-triggered explosions of sub-M Ch WDs, and dynamical mergers of two WDs. For each model, we study the influence of the size and morphology of the progenitor magnetic field between 1 and 1E13 G. Population synthesis based on the observed brightness distribution of SNe Ia was used to estimate the overall contributions to Galactic positrons due to escape from SN Ia. We find that this is dominated by normal-bright SNe Ia, where variations in the distribution of emitted positrons are small. We estimate a total SNe Ia contribution to the Galactic positrons of < 2% and, depending on the magnetic field morphology, less than 6...20% for M(Ch) and sub-M(Ch), respectively.",

While the sources producing UHECRs are still unknown, the Pierre Auger Observatory has detected a large-scale dipole anisotropy in the arrival directions of cosmic rays above 8 EeV. In this work, we explore whether resolved gamma-ray sources can reproduce the Auger dipole. We use various Fermi Large Area Telescope catalogs as sources of cosmic rays in CRPropa simulations. We find that in all cases, the simulated dipole has an amplitude significantly larger than that measured by Auger, even when considering large extragalactic magnetic field strengths and optimistic source weighting schemes. Our result implies that the resolved gamma-ray sources are insufficient to account for the population of sources producing the highest-energy cosmic rays, and there must exist a population of UHECR sources that lack gamma-ray emission or are unresolved by the current-generation gamma-ray telescopes.",

It can recover the standard approach based on boundary conditions, and is derived from a simple physical model that overcomes many of the classical theoretical constraints. We test our formulation by computing the relaxed distribution of disruptive orbits in phase space, that has a simple analytic form and agrees with the pericentre of tidal disruption events at disruption predicted by non-averaged models. This formulation of the problem is particularly suitable for including more physics in tidal disruptions and the analogous problem of gravitational captures, e.g. strong scatterings, gravitational waves emission, physical stellar collisions, and repeating partial disruptions -- that can all act on timescale shorter than two-body relaxation and might cause the tension between the observed vs theoretically predicted population of tidal disruptions.",

      "abstract": "Modeling the Light Curve and Spectra of SN 2023aew Rachid Ouyed (Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada) 12 journal pages, 5 figures, 4 tables. Published in MNRAS (this https URL) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We propose that the delayed conversion of a neutron star (NS) into either a quark star (QS) or a hybrid star (HS), occurring approximately 105-109 days after the supernova (SN) explosion, injects ~ 2e49 erg of thermal energy into the expanded SN ejecta. This energy, delivered over ~ 40 days via a quark-nova (QN) shock or the spin-down power of the HS, can reproduce the photometric and spectral features observed in SN 2023aew. In this model, the first light curve peak corresponds to the 56Ni-powered SN resulting from a stripped-envelope progenitor with a zero-age main sequence mass of at least ~ (15-16)M_sun. The plateau between the two peaks may result from interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM). Alternatively, it could be explained by the spin-down power of the NS prior to its conversion into a highly magnetized HS, which is responsible for powering the second bump. A scenario involving two phases of spin-down power - first from the NS and later from the HS - is compelling and supports the hypothesis that some magnetars are, in fact, HSs. These HSs acquire their ultra-strong magnetic fields through a quark matter phase capable of sustaining core fields on the order of ~ 1e18 G. In our model, the spin-down energy of the HS powers the QN ejecta - the outermost layers of the NS - before this energy is transferred to the expanded SN ejecta. This process produces luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs). The model establishes a potential connection between superluminous SNe (SLSNe) and LFBOTs, with significant implications for high-energy astrophysics and the r-process nucleosynthesis of heavy elements. Potential consequences for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are also discussed.",

Published by ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We perform 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of the fallback debris after a tidal disruption event. We focus on studying the effects of magnetic fields on the formation and early evolution of the accretion flow. We find that large magnetic fields can increase the debris stream thickness, moderately reducing the efficiency of the radiative acceleration of outflows during the first self-intersecting collisions. As gas accumulates and the collisions happen instead between the infalling stream and the accretion flow, magnetized and nonmagnetized systems evolve similarly at these early times: radiation-driven outflows dominate early after the initial stream-stream collision and a few days later, the accretion rate exceeds the mass outflow rate. We find that the MRI does not play a significant role in angular momentum transport and dissipation. Nor do we find evidence of a magnetocentrifugal driven outflow. Instead, collisions continue to dissipate kinetic energy into radiation that launches outflows and powers TDE luminosities reaching $L\\sim4-6\\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Shock-driven outflows and inflows redistribute angular momentum throughout the extent ($\\sim50 r_s$) of the forming eccentric disk. Even in the presence of magnetic stresses, the accretion flow remains mostly eccentric with $e\\sim0.2-0.3$ for $r\\lesssim8r_s$ and $e\\sim0.4-0.5$ for $10\\lesssim r\\,(r_s)\\lesssim50$.

Rev. D 112, 083051 (2025) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an) Detecting continuous gravitational waves (CWs) is challenging due to their weak amplitude and high computational demands, especially with poorly constrained source parameters. Stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) searches using cross-correlation techniques can identify unresolved astrophysical sources, including CWs, at lower computational cost, albeit with reduced sensitivity. This motivates a hybrid approach where SGWB algorithms act as a first-pass filter to identify CW candidates for follow-up with dedicated CW pipelines. We evaluated the discovery potential of the SGWB analysis tool PyStoch for detecting CWs, using simulated signals from spinning down NSs. We then applied the method to data from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O3), covering the (20-1726) Hz frequency band, and targeting four supernova remnants: Vela Jr., G347.3-0.5, Cassiopeia A, and the NS associated with the 1987A supernova remnant. If necessary, significant candidates are followed up using the 5-vector Resampling and Band-Sampled Data Frequency-Hough techniques. However, since no interesting candidates were identified in the real O3 analysis, we set 95\\% confidence-level upper limits on the CW strain amplitude $h_0$. The most stringent limit was obtained for Cassiopeia A, and is $h_0 = 1.13 \\times 10^{-25}$ at $201.57$ Hz with a frequency resolution of $1/32$ Hz. As for the other targets, the best upper limits have been set with the same frequency resolution, and correspond to $h_0 = 1.20 \\times 10^{-25} $ at $202.16$ Hz for G347.3-0.5, $1.20 \\times 10^{-25}$ at $217.81$ Hz for Vela Jr., and $1.47 \\times 10^{-25}$ at $186.41$ Hz for the NS in the 1987A supernova remnant.",

Metzger, Todd A. Thompson, Daryl Haggard, S. Bradley Cenko Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Magnetar giant flares (MGFs) are among the most luminous high-energy transients in the local universe, consisting of a short, intense MeV gamma-ray spike followed by a softer, pulsating X-ray tail and possibly delayed radioactive emission. While only three Galactic events have been firmly detected, several extragalactic candidates have recently been reported, motivating the need for sensitive, rapid-response gamma- and X-ray facilities to constrain their rates and energetics. We present a feasibility study of detecting MGFs with the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), focusing on two complementary pathways: (i) serendipitous discovery of the prompt gamma-ray spike within the field of view, and (ii) rapid follow-up of MGF tails in nearby galaxies. Using sensitivity rescaling and volumetric rate estimates, we find that serendipitous detection of prompt spikes during the mission lifetime is possible but unlikely, primarily because of their short duration and primarily because of their short duration and hard spectrum, in the assumption that the hard gamma-ray spectrum can be reliably extrapolated to the instrument's energy range. In contrast, AXIS's superior sensitivity, if accompanied by fast repointing capabilities, offer an extraordinary opportunity to detect pulsating X-ray tails out to about 20 Mpc, enabling the first extragalactic measurements of periodic modulations from a magnetar and potentially constraining emission geometry and fireball physics. Finally, we evaluate the detectability of soft X-ray line emission from r-process nucleosynthesis in MGFs, finding that such signals are extremely faint and confining the detection to Galactic distances. Our study offer a general framework for assessing the detectability of short transients with future missions.",

Recent observations by {\\gamma}-ray telescopes, particularly by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), have revealed a few tens of UHE sources, indicating numerous Galactic sources capable of accelerating particles to PeV (10^15 electronvolts) energies. However, discerning the dominant acceleration mechanisms (leptonic versus hadronic), the relative contributions of specific source classes, and the role of particle transport in shaping their observed emission are central goals of modern UHE astrophysics. Here we report the discovery of a giant UHE {\\gamma}-ray emitter at -17.5° off the Galactic plane - a region where UHE {\\gamma}-ray sources are rarely found. The emitter exhibits a distinctive asymmetric shape, resembling a giant \"Peanut\" spanning 0.45° \\times 4.6°, indicative of anisotropic particle distribution over a large area. A highly aged millisecond pulsar (MSP) J0218+4232 is the sole candidate accelerator positionally coincident with the Peanut region. Its association with UHE {\\gamma}-rays extending to 0.7 PeV, if confirmed, would provide the first evidence of a millisecond pulsar powering PeV particles. Such a finding challenges prevailing models, which posit that millisecond pulsars cannot sustain acceleration to PeV energies. The detection reveals fundamental gaps in understanding particle acceleration, cosmic-ray transport, and interstellar magnetic field effects, potentially revealing new PeV accelerator (PeVatron) classes.",

Following Paper I, which details the background analytic framework, this second paper provides an overview of the numerical implementation in the form of the code package Diplodocus$.$jl, written in Julia, including the description of a novel Monte-Carlo sampling technique for the pre-computation of anisotropic collision integrals. In addition to the discussion of numerical implementation, a selection of test cases are presented to examine the package's capabilities.

Williams Accepted to ApJL. 37 pages, 12 figures High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Kilonovae, the ultraviolet/optical/infrared counterparts to binary neutron star mergers, are an exceptionally rare class of transients. Optical follow-up campaigns are plagued by contaminating transients, which may mimic kilonovae, but do not receive sufficient observations to measure the full photometric evolution. In this work, we present an analysis of the multi-wavelength dataset of supernova (SN) 2025ulz, a proposed kilonova candidate following the low-significance detection of gravitational waves originating from the potential binary neutron star merger S250818k. Despite an early rapid decline in brightness, our multi-wavelength observations of SN 2025ulz reveal that it is a type IIb supernova. As part of this analysis, we demonstrate the capabilities of a novel quantitative scoring algorithm to determine the likelihood that a transient candidate is a kilonova, based primarily on its 3D location and light curve evolution. We also apply our scoring algorithm to other transient candidates in the localization volume of S250818k and find that, at all times after the discovery of SN 2025ulz, there are $\\geq 4$ candidates with a score comparable to SN 2025ulz, indicating that the kilonova search may have benefited from the additional follow-up of other candidates. During future kilonova searches, this type of scoring algorithm will be useful to rule out contaminating transients in real time, optimizing the use of valuable telescope resources.",

Using these simulation data, we calculate the synchrotron radiation produced by nonthermal electrons accelerated at shocks, adopting reasonable assumptions for the magnetic field and relativistic electron distribution (derived from diffusive shock acceleration theory), and predict the resulting observational signatures. In our fiducial model, shocks driven by AGN winds produce synchrotron emission with luminosities of approximately $10^{29}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}\\,Hz^{-1}}$ in the radio band (0.5-5 GHz), with spectral indices of $\\alpha \\approx -0.4$ to $-0.6$ during the strongest shock phases, gradually steepening to about $-0.8$ to $-1.4$ as the electron population ages. Spatially, the emission is initially concentrated in regions of strong shocks, later expanding into more extended, diffuse structures. We also apply our model to the dwarf elliptical galaxy Messier 32 (M32), and find remarkable consistency between our simulated emission and the observed nuclear radio source, suggesting that this radio component likely originates from hot-wind-driven shocks. Our results indicate that AGN winds not only influence galaxy gas dynamics through mechanical energy input but also yield direct observational evidence via nonthermal radiation. With the advent of next-generation radio facilities such as the FAST Core Array, SKA, and ngVLA, these emission signatures serve as important probes for detecting and characterizing AGN feedback.",

Even though FDs can be observed with simple particle instruments, their amplitude and shape provide physical profiles of passing ICMEs. However, in some cases, previous statistical studies of the heliocentric distance dependence of FD changes associated with ICME propagation have found no strong correlation. We need the criteria for evaluating the relationship between ICMEs structure and FD, necessary for FDs statistical analysis. This study investigates the effect of evolutions and interactions of ICMEs on FDs profiles in the inner Solar System, using multipoint comparisons. We focus on multipoint ICME observations by Solar Orbiter, BepiColombo, and near-Earth spacecraft from March 10-16, 2022, when these spacecraft were ideally located for studying the radial and longitudinal evolutions of ICME and accompanying FDs. We compared GCR variations with the multiple in-situ data and ICME model, clarifying the correspondence between the evolution of each ICME structure in radial and azimuthal directions and the depth and gradients of the FD. The radial comparison revealed decreases in FD intensities and gradients associated with the expansion of the ICME. The longitudinal difference found in FD intensity indicates longitudinal variations of the ICMEs shielding effect. These results suggest that accurate multi-point FD comparisons require determining the relationship between the observers position and the inner structure of the passing ICMEs.",

The selected clusters include LP2373 gp4, NGC 1980, NGC 2451A, NGC 2516, NGC 3532, NGC 6475, UBC 7, Praesepe, and Pleiades. We refine the center positions of the clusters with the Meanshift algorithm. Using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we calculate the velocity dispersion for each cluster and construct one-dimensional velocity dispersion profiles. NGC 2516, NGC 3532, and NGC 6475 show potential central cusps in their radial velocity dispersion profiles, which may indicate the presence of stellar-mass black holes. LP2373 gp4, NGC 6475, and Praesepe all display a negative correlation between velocity dispersion and stellar mass, indicating these clusters are approaching energy equipartition or expanding. NGC 2516 and NGC 3532 exhibit a positive dependence between velocity dispersion and stellar mass, which may be attributed to the preferential ejection of massive stars following dynamical interactions involving binaries or black holes. These two clusters are the only two that are dynamical not relaxed and are closest to virial equilibrium. We compare the observations with N-body simulations of star clusters. A comparison of observed and simulated velocity dispersion profiles reveals that NGC 2516 and NGC 3532 exhibit lower proper motion dispersions than model clusters. Better agreement with the observed profiles is achieved for model clusters with larger ages. This suggests that the observed clusters may have undergone rapid dynamical evolution. Our results suggest that NGC 2516 and NGC 3532 may host at least two stellar-mass black holes each.",

Skillman, N. S. J. Rogers, J. Chisholm 32 pages with 16 figures and 5 tables. Appendix includes additional figures and tables. Accepted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Recent JWST observations have uncovered a population of compact, high-redshift ($z>6$) galaxies exhibiting extreme nebular conditions and enhanced nitrogen abundances that challenge standard chemical evolution paradigms. We present a joint UV and optical abundance analysis using a new suite of $\\texttt{Cloudy}$ photoionization models covering a wide density range ($n_e=10^2-10^9$ cm$^{-3}$), combined with HST and JWST spectroscopy for a sample of star-forming galaxies across $0.0\\lesssim z \\lesssim10.6$. We find that assuming uniform, low-density conditions ($n_e\\sim10^2$ cm$^{-3}$) in high-density environments ($n_e\\sim10^5$ cm$^{-3}$) can bias nebular diagnostics by overestimating $T_e$ (up to 1800 K), overpredicting $\\log U$ (by $>1$ dex), and underestimating O/H (up to 0.67 dex), while only modestly inflating N/O. Therefore, robust abundance determinations at high-$z$ require a multi-phase density model. Using this model, we recalculate O/H and N/O abundances for our sample and present the first $\\log U$ diagnostics and ICFs for high-ionization UV N lines. We find that the UV tracers systematically overestimate N/O by $\\sim0.3-0.4$ dex relative to the optical benchmark. We find that N/O increases with redshift, correlating with both $n_e$ and star formation rate surface density ($\\rm\\Sigma_{SFR}$), suggesting that N/O is temporarily enhanced in compact, high-pressure environments. However, the $n_e$ evolution with $z$ is more gradual than the $(1+z)^3$ scaling of virial halo densities, suggesting that $n_e$evolution is shaped by both cosmological structure growth and baryonic processes. These trends point to prompt N/O enrichment potentially driven by very massive stars, with key implications for interpreting UV emission and determining reliable chemical abundances from JWST observations of the early universe.",

It has recently been suggested that angular diameter distances derived from comparing the variability timescales of blazars to angular size measurements with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) may provide an alternative method to study the cosmological evolution of the Universe. Once the intrinsic brightness temperature ($T_{\\rm int}$) is known, the angular diameter distance may be found without knowledge of the relativistic Doppler factor, opening up the possibility of a single rung distance measurement method from low $(z_{\\rm cos}\\ll1)$ to high $(z_{\\rm cos}>4)$ redshifts. Aims. We aim to verify whether the variability-based estimates of the intrinsic brightness temperature of multiple active galactic nuclei (AGNs) converges to a common value. We also investigate whether the intrinsic brightness temperature changes as a function of frequency. Methods. We estimated the $T_{\\rm int}$ of AGNs based on the flux variability of the radio cores of their jets. We utilized radio core light curves and size measurements of 75 sources at 15 GHz and of 37 sources at 43 GHz. We also derived $T_{\\rm int}$ from a population study of the brightness temperatures of VLBI cores using VLBI survey data of more than $100$ sources at 24, 43, and 86 GHz. Results. Radio core variability-based estimates of $T_{\\rm int}$ constrain upper limits of $\\log_{10}T_{\\rm int}$ [K]$<11.56$ at 15~GHz and $\\log_{10}T_{\\rm int}$ [K]$<11.65$ at 43 GHz under a certain set of geometric assumptions. The population analysis suggests lower limits of $\\log_{10}T_{\\rm int}$ [K]$>9.7$, $9.1$, and $9.3$ respectively at 24, 43, and 86 GHz. Even with monthly observations, variability-based estimates of $T_{\\rm int}$ appear to be cadence-limited. Conclusions. Methods used to constrain $T_{\\rm int}$ are more uncertain than previously thought. However, with improved datasets, the estimates should converge.",

We aim to spectroscopically measure for the first time the Lyman continuum (LyC) over a wider rest-frame wavelength range of ~ 600 - 900A compared to ~ 850 - 900A in previous studies of galaxies at z ~ 0.3 - 0.4. The HST data are supplemented by SDSS spectra of all galaxies and by a VLT/Xshooter spectrum of one galaxy, J0232+0025. These data are used to derive the spectral energy distribution in the entire UV and optical range, the stellar mass, and the chemical composition from the nebular emission lines. We detect stellar LyC emission in seven out of eleven galaxies with escape fractions, f_esc(LyC), in the range of ~ 2 - 60%, and establish upper limits for f_esc(LyC) in the remaining galaxies. We discover for the first time nebular LyC emission as a bump just bluewards of the LyC limit at 912A in two galaxies, J0232+0025 and J1021+0436. We find a similar bump among our earlier studies in a less distant galaxy J1243+4646 with z = 0.4317. We conclude that the use of the LyC continuum in the wavelength range close to the LyC limit, which contains both the stellar and nebular continua, requires special consideration to not overestimate the observed f_esc(LyC).",

Zee, Jun-Sung Moon, Sanjaya Paudel, Suk-Jin Yoon Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Enhanced star formation (SF) with star-forming neighboring galaxies bolsters hydrodynamical contributions during paired interactions. Although the relative spin orientation between interacting galaxies can influence this effect, it has not been comprehensively explored. In this study, using a curated sample of nearby (0.02 < z < 0.06) spiral-spiral pairs and an isolated control sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, coupled with Galaxy Zoo 2, and a method to estimate spin-spin alignment (SSA), we systematically compare the impact of the relative orientation, $\\cos\\xi$, on interaction-induced SF. We find that SSA is a key factor alongside the conventional parameters of projected separation and the SF of neighboring galaxies. The SF enhancement increases as configurations transition from perpendicular ($\\cos\\xi \\sim 0$) to well aligned ($\\cos\\xi > 0.7$). The effect is strongest when neighboring galaxies have higher SF, indicating a hydrodynamical origin. The trend is consistent with increased hydrodynamical friction via stronger ram pressure and a higher likelihood of prograde orbits in well-aligned pairs.",

Nevertheless, their inherently faint nature, coupled with observational difficulties such as stray light interference and variations in the sky background, has significantly impeded comprehensive studies of LSB features. The KASI Deep Rolling Imaging Fast Telescope (K-DRIFT) project aims to address these observational challenges by developing off-axis freeform three-mirror telescopes and observational strategies specifically designed for LSB imaging surveys. The first generation of the K-DRIFT (K-DRIFT G1) has been successfully completed, and the forthcoming survey, scheduled to commence shortly, is expected to yield novel insights into the LSB universe. This paper outlines the scientific motivations of the project, discusses the technical challenges encountered, highlights the innovative solutions devised, and describes the future trajectory of the K-DRIFT.",

The spatial point spread function is modeled primarily by a sum of two Gaussians as a function of wavelength and is used to fit and subtract the quasar from the 2D spectra, leaving only extended galaxy emission which we analyze. Ten of 12 systems show spatially extended line emission and five of 12 systems show an extended stellar continuum. From the extended [OIII]5008 emission line, we measure a 132 ${\\pm}$ 19 km/s ionized outflow in one system and 52 ${\\pm}$ 12 km/s rotation, suggesting a coherent disk, in another. From the extended narrow H${\\alpha}$ emission, which we hypothesize is ionized by star-forming regions rather than the quasar, we measure star formation rates ranging from ${\\sim}$ 7 to 111 M${_\\odot}$/yr, the majority of which are consistent with the star-forming main sequence at z ${\\approx}$ 6. The positions of our host galaxies on the log10[OIII]5008/H${\\beta}$ vs. log10[NII]6584/H${\\alpha}$ (R3N2) Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram indicate ionization rates typical of AGN activity in the low-redshift universe, but are consistent with the placement of similar z ${\\approx}$ 6 quasar host galaxies, suggesting that the R3N2 line ratios cannot distinguish AGN and star-formation powered line emission at high redshifts.

Focusing on pairs with stellar masses and separations comparable to the Milky Way-Andromeda (MW-M31) system, we measure the angle between the pair connecting line and the orientation of the host filament, determined using a filament catalog constructed via the Bisous model. Our analysis reveals a statistically significant tendency of galaxy pairs to align their connecting lines along their host filaments, manifesting as an overall $\\sim$7\\% excess of alignment angles smaller than the MW-M31 case compared to a random distribution. Crucially, the strength of this alignment exhibits a strong dependence on the distance to the filament spine. Pairs located within 0.2 Mpc from the filament spine show the strongest alignment, while those beyond 1 Mpc display no significant alignment. Furthermore, we identify a bimodal distribution of alignment angles near filament cores, suggesting distinct dynamical populations potentially associated with infall and interaction processes. Our results provide robust observational support for theoretical models in which anisotropic accretion and tidal forces within the cosmic web drive galaxy pair evolution. They also position the MW-M31 system as a representative filament-aligned pair, offering insights into Local Group assembly. This study demonstrates the cosmic web's critical role in dictating pair orientations and motivates future work with kinematic data to unravel galaxy-environment interplay.",

Taking advantage of FAST's blind, wide-area coverage and uniform sensitivity, we assemble a sample of $230$ group galaxies and a matched control sample of isolated systems, and apply censored-data modeling to include both detections and non-detections. At fixed stellar mass and color, we find that the global median HI fraction of group galaxies differs from that of controls by only $-0.04$ dex ($95\\%$ CI [$-0.18,\\ 0.16$]), indicating at most a mild average offset. The signal is not uniform across populations: satellites are HI-poor (median $\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{HI}}=-0.12$ dex), whereas centrals are consistent with normal to mildly HI-rich (median $\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{HI}}=0.13$ dex). Group galaxies located within $0.5R_{180}$ and in denser systems (richness $>10$ or local density $\\Sigma>10\\ \\mathrm{gal\\ Mpc^{-2}}$) show stronger negative offsets, whereas galaxies in the outskirts are statistically indistinguishable from the controls. These results refine earlier reports of global group HI deficiency: with deeper blind data and uniform treatment of upper limits, we show that HI depletion is primarily confined to satellites and compact cores rather than being ubiquitous across groups.",

Our sample comprises $\\sim$56,000 SFGs over $0 < z < 5.7$. We first analyze the deepest field (ELAIS-N1), then jointly model all three fields while accounting for their distinct flux limits and selection functions. Using adaptive kernel density estimation (KDE), we reconstruct the LF continuously across redshift and luminosity without binning or parametric assumptions. The KDE results reveal clear signatures of joint luminosity and density evolution (LADE). Motivated by this, we construct and fit three parametric models--pure luminosity evolution (PLE) and two LADE variants--using a full maximum-likelihood method that includes completeness corrections and constraints from the local radio LF and Euclidean-normalized source counts (SCs). Model selection using Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria strongly favors LADE over PLE. For ELAIS-N1, the more flexible LADE model (Model C) provides the best fit, while for the combined fields, the simpler Model B balances fit quality and complexity more effectively. Both LADE models reproduce the observed LFs and SCs across luminosity and flux density ranges, whereas PLE underperforms. We also identify a mild excess at the bright end of the LF, likely due to residual AGN contamination. This study demonstrates that combining KDE with parametric modeling offers a robust framework for quantifying the evolving radio LF of SFGs, paving the way for future work with next-generation surveys like the SKA.",

Dang Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; $M_{BH} \\approx 10^{3-5} M_\\odot$) play a critical role in understanding the formation of supermassive black holes in the early universe. In this study, we expand on Nguyen et al. simulated measurements of IMBH masses using stellar kinematics, which will be observed with the High Angular Resolution Monolithic Optical and Near-infrared Integral (HARMONI) field spectrograph on the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) up to the distance of 20 Mpc. Our sample focuses on both the Virgo Cluster in the northern sky and the Fornax Cluster in the southern sky. We begin by identifying dwarf galaxies hosting nuclear star clusters, which are thought to be nurseries for IMBHs in the local universe. As a case study, we conduct simulations for FCC 119, the second faintest dwarf galaxies in the Fornax Cluster at 20 Mpc, which is also fainter than most of Virgo Cluster members. We use the galaxy's surface brightness profile from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, combined with an assumed synthetic spectrum, to create mock observations with the {\\tt HSIM} simulator and Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM). These mock HARMONI datacubes are analyzed as if they were real observations, employing JAM within a Bayesian framework to infer IMBH masses and their associated uncertainties. We find that ELT/HARMONI can detect the stellar kinematic signature of an IMBH and accurately measure its mass for $M_{BH} \\gtrsim 10^5 M_\\odot$ out to distances of $\\sim$20 Mpc.",

Correlation between Velocity Map Morphology, Star Formation, and Metallicity in Regular Disk Galaxies Shuai Feng, Shiyin Shen, Yanmei Chen, Y.Sophia Dai, Jun Yin, Wenyuan Cui, Mengting Ju, Linlin Li 16 pages, 6 figures, accepted by ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The morphology of ionized gas velocity maps provides a direct probe of the internal gas kinematics of galaxies. Using integral field spectroscopy from SDSS-IV MaNGA, we analyze a sample of 528 low-inclination, regular disk galaxies to investigate the correlations between velocity map morphology, star formation rate, and gas-phase metallicity. We quantify velocity map morphology using harmonic expansion and adopt two complementary diagnostics: the global kinematic asymmetry, which traces non-axisymmetric perturbations, and the first-order term ratio, which captures axisymmetric radial motions. We find that galaxies with higher kinematic asymmetry are more likely to deviate from the scaling relations, typically lying either above or below the star formation main sequence and systematically below the mass-metallicity relation. In contrast, the first-order term ratio shows only a correlation with gas-phase metallicity in the low-mass range and no significant dependence on star formation rate. Moreover, galaxies below the mass-metallicity relation generally exhibit higher HI gas fractions. These results suggest that external gas accretion is the primary driver of the observed phenomena: inflowing metal-poor gas increases velocity map asymmetry in disk galaxies, dilutes the metallicity, and triggers enhanced star formation. Feedback-driven outflows, bar- and spiral-driven inflows, and galaxy mergers may also contribute, but likely play a secondary role.",

Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present spatially resolved mass outflow rates of the ionized and molecular gas in the narrow line region of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3227. Using long-slit spectroscopy and [O III] imaging from from Hubble Space Telescope's Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and Apache Point Observatory's Kitt Peak Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph, in conjunction with Cloudy photoionization models and emission line diagnostics, we find a peak ionized mass outflow rate of $\\dot M_{\\text{ion}} =$ $19.9\\pm9.2$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ at a distance of $47\\pm6$ pc from the supermassive black hole (SMBH). Using archival data from the Gemini-North Near-infrared Field Spectrograph measuring H$_2$ $\\lambda2.1218$ $\\mu$m emission, we find a maximum peak warm molecular outflow rate of $\\dot M_{\\mathrm{H_2}} \\le 9 \\times 10^{-4}$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ at a distance of $36\\pm6$ pc from the SMBH. Using archival data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array measuring CO(2-1) emission, we find a maximum peak cold molecular gas mass outflow rate of $\\dot M_{\\mathrm{CO}} \\le$ $23.1$ M$_\\odot$ year$^{-1}$ at a distance of $57\\pm6$ pc from the SMBH. For the first time, we calculate spatially resolved gas evacuation timescales for the cold molecular gas reservoirs ostensibly sourcing the outflows, and find that evacuating gas to $\\sim$400 pc from the SMBH occurs on timescales of $10^{6.0} - 10^{7.6}$ years. These results indicate that the multi-phase AGN outflows are effective in clearing the inner few hundred parsecs of NGC 3227's gas content on timescales that may set the AGN duty cycle of $10^5 - 10^8$ years.",

We release the tool as a python package, available at: this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Quasars at the redshift frontier (z > 7.0) are fundamental probes of black hole (BH) growth and evolution but notoriously difficult to identify. At these redshifts, machine learning-based selection methods have proven to be efficient, but require appropriate training sets to express their full potential. Here, we present QUEST, a Variational Auto-Encoder capable of generating realistic quasar spectra that can be post-processed for generating synthetic photometry and for spectral imputation. We start from the SDSS DR16Q catalogue, pre-process the spectra, and vet the sample to obtain a clean data set. After training the model, we investigate the properties of its latent space to understand whether it has learnt relevant physics. We provide a pipeline to generate photometry from the sampled spectra, compare it with actual quasar photometry, and showcase the capabilities of the model in reconstructing and extending quasar spectra. The trained network faithfully reproduces the input spectrum, both in terms of sample median and variance. By examining the latent space, we find correlations with continuum and bolometric luminosity, BH mass, redshift, continuum slope, and emission line properties. When used to generate photometry, we find results in excellent agreement with the control sample. The model provides satisfactory results in reconstructing emission lines: estimates of the BH mass from the reconstructed spectra are in good agreement with those from the original spectra. Furthermore, when spectra with broad absorption line features are reconstructed, the model successfully interpolates over the absorption systems. Compared with previous work, we find excellent agreement between the spectra sampled from our model and the output of their results. However, QUEST does not require any ad-hoc tuning, and is capable of reproducing the full variety of spectra available in the training set.",

There have been discussions regarding the possibility of using Type-II Cepheids (T2Cs) as an alternative tool, but rarely was this ever implemented. The aim of this project is to assert the use of T2Cs as a new avenue for calibrating the extragalactic distance scale, by using M31 as a benchmark galaxy. Since Ordinary Least Squares regression methods are not immune to outliers and offer an incomplete treatment of the uncertainties, we favor a Bayesian robust regression model to compute new Period--Luminosity (PL) and Period--Wesenheit (PW) relations calibrated using $\\sim$100 T2Cs, $\\sim$1000 fundamental-mode and $\\sim$750 first-overtone classical Cepheids (CCs) in the LMC. Using these relations, we employ a classification routine based on Bhattacharyya distances to filter out any contaminants from the M31 sample. We validate our method by verifying that we retrieve an accurate distance for the LMC. We find a distance to M31 of $24.487\\pm0.001$ (statistical) $\\pm0.052$ (systematic) mag using CCs and of $24.409\\pm0.025$ (statistical) $\\pm0.156$ (systematic) mag using T2Cs. Both values are in excellent agreement with literature values derived from meta-analyses, from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of CCs, from the Tip of the Red Giant Branch method, and from HST observations of RR Lyrae. In almost all cases, we reach a relative accuracy better than 98\\%, although the archival ground-based data we use cannot compare with HST photometry. We demonstrate that T2Cs can also be used as accurate tracers for determining extragalactic distances, thereby making them excellent candidates for JWST, LSST, and ELT observations. These stars allow us to probe galaxies deprived of young populations and are beyond the reach of the fainter RR Lyrae.",

However, the exhaustive exploration of a reactive network is often a daunting task, resulting in unexplored reactive channels that affect kinetic outcomes and branching ratios. Here, an automated workflow for exploring reactive potential energy surfaces (PESs) is employed for the first time to study the oxirane (C$_2$H$_4$O) plus methylidyne ($^.$CH) reaction. The ultimate goal is to comprehensively map its PES and, subsequently, derive rate constants for the most important reaction channels. In addition to its astrochemical relevance, this reaction has been considered because it is a challenging test case, its network being very extended, with 60 exothermic bimolecular products lying below the reactant's energy. Kinetic simulations indicate that the main product of the reaction is the HCO radical plus ethene (C$_2$H$_4$), while formation of s-trans-propenal (acrolein) and 2H-oxene is also possible, but to a lesser extent. Based on the present study and other references in the literature, we suggest that the slightly higher relative abundance of s-trans-propenal compared to methyl ketene in the interstellar medium is a gas-phase kinetic effect, s-trans-propenal being a more easily accessible product on the C$_3$H$_5$O$^.$ PES.",

Aguerri, Daniela Palma 12 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Virgo cluster is one of the closest clusters to us where we can further study the evolution of galaxies, with several infalling substructures and several filaments around it have been reported. Therefore, it makes this cluster and its surrounding an interesting place to study the spatial distribution of the population of dwarf and bright giant galaxies. We analyse the dwarf fraction (DF) in different regions of the cluster, inside the virial radius, in its surrounding area, and in the filamentary structure surrounding it using available catalogues with the aim of measuring whether the DF changes in different environments. Although the total dwarf fraction within the cluster is $\\sim$ 0.8, significant local variations are measured throughout the cluster; there are regions with a relatively higher concentration of giant or dwarf galaxies. The fact that Virgo is embedded in a rich environment surrounded by several filaments that feed the cluster with new substructures could imply changes in the DF locally. When we analyse the DF variation at further distances from the cluster we observe some regions with few or no giant galaxies at all, with a locally DF ranging from 0.8 - 1.0. Additionally, when comparing the dwarf fraction in different environments, overall, the DF is larger in regions further away from denser regions such as the Virgo cluster and its filamentary structure surrounding it. When comparing the filament and the cluster area, the dwarf fraction is slightly higher in the filaments, but from filament to filament, the DF changes depending on the presence of groups.",

We have developed a novel integration scheme of $N$-body/hydrodynamics simulations working with machine learning. This approach bypasses the short timesteps caused by supernova explosions using a surrogate model, thereby improving scalability. With this method, we reached 300 billion particles using 148,900 nodes, equivalent to 7,147,200 CPU cores, breaking through the billion-particle barrier currently faced by state-of-the-art simulations. This resolution allows us to perform the first star-by-star galaxy simulation, which resolves individual stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. The performance scales over $10^4$ CPU cores, an upper limit in the current state-of-the-art simulations using both A64FX and X86-64 processors and NVIDIA CUDA GPUs.",

Somerville, Shy Genel, Osase Omoruyi, Amiel Sternberg Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We measure and analyze the inflows and outflows of mass, energy, and metals through the interstellar medium (ISM) and circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies in the IllustrisTNG100 simulations. We identify the dominant feedback mechanism in bins of halo virial mass and redshift by computing the integrated energy input from SNe and the ``kinetic'' and ``thermal'' mode of AGN feedback. We measure all quantities in a shell at the virial radius (``halo scale'') and one chosen to be approximately at the interface of the CGM and the interstellar medium (ISM; ``ISM scale''). We find that galaxies have strong net positive inflows on halo scales, and weaker but still net positive inflows on ISM scales, at $z\\gtrsim 2$. At later times, partially due to the onset of kinetic AGN feedback in massive halos, inflows and outflows nearly balance one another, leading to the familiar effects of the slow-down of galaxy growth and the onset of quenching. Halos dominated by SN feedback show only weak evidence of preventative feedback on halo scales, and we see excess ISM scale accretion indicative of rapid gas recycling. Wind mass loadings decrease with increasing halo mass, and with increasing redshift, while energy loadings are nearly independent of both mass and redshift. The detailed catalogs of these mass, metal, and energy inflow and outflow rates on galaxy and halo scales can be used to guide empirical and semi-analytic models, and provide deeper insight into how galaxy growth and quenching is regulated in the IllustrisTNG simulations.",

The parameters are inferred using the Mixture Model for Open clusters (MiMO), a novel Bayesian framework for modeling clusters in the color-magnitude diagram. By explicitly accounting for field-star contamination as a model component, MiMO removes the conventional need for stringent membership preselection, allowing for a more complete inclusion of member stars and thereby enhancing both precision and robustness. Our results broadly agree with existing catalogs but offer improved precision. For each cluster, we provide the best-fit age, metallicity, distance, extinction, and MF slope, along with their full likelihood chains and photometric membership probabilities for individual stars. We further identify an ``MF Prime'' subsample of 163 clusters with high-quality data, for which the MF estimates are considered most reliable.

      "abstract": "Validating Open Cluster Candidates with Photometric Bayesian Evidence Lu Li, Zhaozhou Li, Zhengyi Shao Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The thousands of open cluster (OC) candidates identified by the Gaia mission are significantly contaminated by false positives from field star fluctuations, posing a major validation challenge. Based on the Mixture Model for OCs (MiMO), we present a Bayesian framework for validating OC candidates in the color--magnitude diagram. The method compares the Bayesian evidence of two competing models: a single stellar population with field contamination versus a pure field population. Their ratio, the Bayes factor (BF), quantifies the statistical support for cluster existence. Tests on confirmed clusters and random fields show that a threshold of BF > 100 effectively distinguishes genuine clusters from chance field overdensities. This approach provides a robust, quantitative tool for OC validation and catalog refinement. The framework is extendable to multi-dimensional validation incorporating kinematics and is broadly applicable to other resolved stellar systems, including candidate moving groups, stellar streams, and dwarf satellites.",

Carrasco-González, R. Brose, K.M. Menten Submitted to A&A, abstract shortened for arxiv character limits Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Bow shocks around massive stars have primarily been detected in IR emission, but radio detections are becoming more frequent with the commissioning of sensitive and large field-of-view interferometers. Radio data probes both thermal and non-thermal emission, thereby constraining the relativistic electron population. We undertook a radio survey for bow shocks based on IR catalogues of candidates, using the VLA and the 100-m Effelsberg Telescope, aiming for new detections and to better characterise the multi-wavelength emission. We used Gaia DR3 to re-calculate spatial motion of the driving stars with respect to the surrounding stellar population. We studied the radio emission from bow shocks using emission maps and spectral-index measurements, and compared our results with data from catalogues and multi-wavelength emission. Of the 24 targets observed with the VLA in the 4-12 GHz band, six were clearly detected (including two previously reported) and 5 possibly detected. A subset of these were also observed and detected with Effelsberg at 4-8 GHz. The VLA-derived spectral index maps indicate non-thermal emission for most sources, but the statistical uncertainties are large for most sources and all Effelsberg observations indicate thermal emission. Assuming thermal emission, we obtain upper limits on the electron density within the shocked layer. We obtained upper limits on radio emission from the bow shock of Zeta Oph at a similar flux level to predictions from MHD simulations. Our survey marks a significant addition to the ca. 10 previously known radio-emitting bow shocks in the literature, and demonstrates that deep, targeted radio surveys can effectively detect IR-selected bow shocks. Follow-up observations of these targets at lower and higher frequencies are encouraged to determine whether any are non-thermal emitters like the bow shocks of BD+43, BD+60 and LS2355. (abridged)",

Trager 16 pages (3 pages appendix), 19 figures. Re-submitted to the journal after a positive referee report Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate the role of galactic bars in fuelling and triggering Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in disc galaxies up to $z\\sim 0.8$. We utilise a Deep Learning model, fine-tuned on Galaxy Zoo volunteer classifications, to identify (strongly and weakly) barred and unbarred disc galaxies in Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program $i$-band images. We select AGN using three independent diagnostics: mid-infrared colours, X-ray detections, and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. The SED analysis, performed using CIGALE, quantifies the relative AGN contribution to the total galaxy luminosity ($f_{\\rm AGN}$) and the AGN luminosity ($L_{\\rm disc}$). We assess the impact of bars by comparing AGN incidence and properties in barred galaxies against carefully constructed redshift-, stellar mass-, and colour-matched unbarred control samples. Our binary AGN classification experiment demonstrates that barred disc galaxies host a statistically detectable higher fraction of AGN compared to their unbarred counterparts, suggesting a contributing role for bars in the global AGN budget. The contribution of bars to AGN fuelling appears confined to systems where the AGN has a lower relative contribution to the host galaxy's emission ($f_{\\rm AGN} < 0.75$). Crucially, we find a significant dearth of barred disc galaxies hosting AGN with $f_{\\rm AGN} > 0.75$, independent of bar strength. Consistent with this, the fraction of barred galaxies among AGN hosts decreases with increasing $L_{\\rm disc}$. Combined with previous results, we suggest that bars contribute to fuelling the population of low-to-moderate luminosity AGN, but major mergers are the principal mechanism for triggering the most powerful and dominant accretion events.",

Esquivel Submitted to MNRAS October 23, 2025 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present an unexplored scenario for interpreting the outflows in the EGO G338.92+0.55 (b) region (hereafter, EGO G338). Within this framework, we investigate the hypothesis that the interaction between two outflows is responsible for the observed morphology and kinematics of this astrophysical object. To explore this possibility, we reanalyse the region using observational molecular line data. We base our analysis on maps of moments 0, 1, and 2 of the CO emission associated with the molecular outflows. Additionally, we conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to examine the presence or absence of a collision between two jets. From our numerical results, we produce synthetic CO images to facilitate a direct comparison with observations. The findings of this study provide compelling evidence that the observed morphology and kinematics in the EGO G338 region are the result of a likely collision between two molecular outflows.",

Using the data from the DAWN JWST Archive, we conduct a comprehensive study on the large-scale structure, stellar mass function (SMF), quiescent members, and dark matter halos in the Cosmic Vine. First, we spectroscopically confirm 136 galaxies in the Vine at z=3.44, and an additional 47 galaxies belonging to a diffuse foreground structure at z=3.34 which we dub the Leaf. We identify four subgroups comprising the Cosmic Vine and two subgroups within the Leaf. Second, we identified 11 quiescent members with log(M*/Msun)=9.5-11.0, the largest sample of quiescent galaxies in overdense environments at z>3, which gives an enhanced quiescent galaxy number density 2x10^(-4)cMpc^(-3) that is three times above the field level at log(M*/Msun) > 10. Notably, these quiescent members form a tight red sequence on the color-magnitude diagram, making it one of the earliest red sequences known to date. Third, by constructing the SMFs for both star-forming and quiescent members, we find that both SMFs are top-heavy, with a significantly enhanced quiescent fraction at log(M*/Msun)>10.5 compared to field counterparts. The stellar mass-size analysis reveals that star-forming members are more compact at higher masses than their field counterparts. Finally, we estimate a halo mass of log(Mh/Msun)=13.2+-0.3 for the protocluster core, and log(Mh/Msun)=11.9-12.4 for satellite subgroups. The phase-space analysis indicates that three subgroups are likely infalling to the core. This work reveals a high abundance of massive galaxies and dark matter halos in a forming cluster, demonstrating the accelerated assembly of massive galaxies in massive halos when the Universe was less than 2 billion years old.",

Osten 60 pages, 18 figures, 7 tables, submitted to AJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We report on a study of 36 pairs of `twin' M dwarfs in wide binaries and assess how similarly the stars behave. Stars in each twin pair have BP, RP, $J$, $H$, and $K_s$ differing by $<$0.10 mag, mass estimates matching within $<$3%, and presumably the same age and composition. We utilize short- and long-term photometry, multi-epoch spectroscopy, and archival data to measure rotation periods, photometric activity levels, and H$\\alpha$ equivalent widths for many systems. Speckle imaging, radial velocities, and long-term astrometry are used to identify unresolved companions, yielding three systems with unseen components. Among the 33 remaining twin systems, numerous remarkable pairs show nearly identical rotation rates and activity levels between their twin components, including cases throughout the lower main sequence and across a broad range of rotation-activity parameter space. In contrast, mismatches with $>$25% differences exist in rotation period for $21\\%_{-7\\%}^{+14\\%}$ of twin pairs, in rotation amplitude for $67\\%_{-15\\%}^{+10\\%}$ of pairs, in multi-year photometric variability for $33\\%_{-9\\%}^{+12\\%}$ of pairs, and in H$\\alpha$ activity for $21\\%_{-6\\%}^{+9\\%}$ of pairs, with fully convective systems generally mismatched more often. Thus, roughly one out of five M dwarf twin sets does not match in rotation and/or activity despite otherwise identical fundamental parameters. Furthermore, we compile three key systems showing larger relative active/inactive H$\\alpha$ mismatches. We propose the various mismatches likely stem from factors such as dynamo stochasticity, activity cycles, formative disk aspects, and/or star-planet interactions, depending on the system. These well-vetted twins offer ripe targets for many future investigations.",

We build a dataset of 134,533 galaxy images (HSC-PDR2) and spectra (DESI-DR1) and adapt a Multi-Modal Masked Autoencoder (MMAE) to embed both images and spectra in a shared representation. The MMAE is a transformer-based architecture, which we train by masking 75% of the data and reconstructing missing image and spectral tokens. We use this model to test three applications: spectral and image reconstruction from heavily masked data and redshift regression from images alone. It recovers key physical features, such as galaxy shapes, atomic emission line peaks, and broad continuum slopes, though it struggles with fine image details and line strengths. For redshift regression, the MMAE performs comparably or better than prior multi-modal models in terms of prediction scatter even when missing spectra in testing. These results highlight both the potential and limitations of masked autoencoders in astrophysics and motivate extensions to additional modalities, such as text, for foundation models.",

These evolved giants are considered to be standard candles due to their low intrinsic variance in their absolute luminosities, allowing us to estimate their distances with reasonable confidence. We exploit all-sky photometry from the AllWISE mid-infrared survey and the Gaia survey, along with astrometry from Gaia Data Release 3 and recent 3D extinction maps, to develop a probabilistic scheme in order to select with high confidence RC-like stars. Our curated catalogue contains about 10 million sources, for which we estimate photometric distances based on the WISE W1 photometry. We then derive the selection function for our sample, which is the combined selection function of sources with both Gaia and AllWISE photometry. Using the distances and accounting for the full selection function of our observables, we are able to fit a two-disc, multi-parameter model to constrain the scale height (hz), scale-length (rd), flaring, and the relative mass ratios of the two disc components. We illustrate and verify our methodology using mock catalogues of RC stars. We find that the RC population is best described by a flared disc with scale length rd=$4.24\\pm0.32$ kpc and scale height at the Sun of hz(at Sun)=$0.18\\pm0.01$ kpc, and a shorter and thicker disc with rd=$2.66\\pm0.11$ kpc, hz(at Sun)=$0.48\\pm0.11$ kpc, with no flare. The thicker disc constitutes 66\\% of the RC stellar mass beyond 3 kpc, while the flared disc shows evidence of being warped beyond 9 kpc from the Galactic center. The residuals between the predicted number density of RC stars from our axisymmetric model and the measured counts show possible evidence of a two-armed spiral perturbation in the disc of the Milky Way.",

Huang, Jay Anderson The Astrophysical Journal, 992:213 (25pp), 2025 October 20 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present a structural analysis of the young massive star cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd 1). With multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, we measure the proper motions of $10346$ stars and determine their kinematic memberships by fitting a Gaussian mixture model to their proper motions. After correcting for extinction and completeness, we model the stellar density distribution and confirm the presence of an elongation with an eccentricity of $0.71$. The eccentricity decreases slightly with increasing mass. We fit the radial profile with the Elson, Fall, and Freeman model, observing a decrease in the core radius with increasing mass, indicative of weak but detectable mass segregation. This finding is further supported by a measured mass segregation ratio of $\\Lambda_\\mathrm{\\rm MSR}=1.11\\pm0.11$, only above $1$ by $1\\sigma$, and slightly shorter minimum spanning tree length for higher mass bins. The cluster has a 1D velocity dispersion of $3.42 \\pm 0.10~\\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, suggesting it is subvirial. The subvirial state implies either exceptionally high star formation efficiency or inefficient stellar feedback caused by local gas expulsion before stars reach the cluster. The crossing time is $0.30$ Myr and the relaxation time is $0.26$ Gyr. Given the age of Wd 1 of $10.7$ Myr, we expect evident mass segregation for stars more massive than $10~M_\\odot$, which accounts for the minor mass segregation found in the mass range of $1.00\\unicode{x2013}12.14~M_\\odot$ in this work. This suggests the overall mass segregation in Wd 1 is not primordial.",

Accepted to publication in Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) In this work, we investigate the global structural properties and fractality of 1,876 open clusters (OCs) in different environments, including 1,145 singles, 392 pairs, and 339 groups. We analyze cluster mass, age, size, concentration, and fractal structure using the Q parameter and the fractal dimension fdim, and examine their correlations with key physical parameters. Our results reveal systematic environmental trends: clusters in groups are generally younger, less massive, slightly larger, and less centrally concentrated than those in pairs or singles. Fractality is more pronounced in clusters within pairs and groups, with 44% of group clusters exhibiting fractal substructure compared to 38.5% for pairs and 33.2% for singles. Similarly, median fdim values increase from singles (1.13) to pairs (1.16) to groups (1.25), reflecting greater substructure in denser environments. These findings indicate that both intrinsic cluster properties and environmental context significantly influence cluster evolution. More massive clusters tend to evolve toward centrally concentrated, radially symmetric configurations, while less massive clusters retain fractal features for longer periods. Overall, our study demonstrates that open clusters do not evolve in isolation: interactions with the environment play a critical role in shaping their structural evolution and dynamical state.",

Accepted 24/10/2025 to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a multiphase, resolved study of the galactic wind extending from the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 4666. For this we use VLT/MUSE observations from the GECKOS program and HI data from the WALLABY survey. We identify both ionised and HI gas in a biconical structure extending to at least $z\\sim$8 kpc from the galaxy disk, with increasing velocity offsets above the midplane in both phases, consistent with a multiphase wind. The measured electron density, using [SII], differs significantly from standard expectations of galactic winds. We find electron density declines from the galaxy centre to $\\sim2$ kpc, then rises again, remaining high ($\\sim100-300$ cm$^{-3}$) out to $\\sim$5 kpc. We find that HI dominates the mass loading. The total HI mass outflow rate (above $z~>2$ kpc) is between $5-13~M_{\\odot}~\\rm yr^{-1}$, accounting for uncertainties from disk-blurring and group interactions. The total ionised mass outflow rate (traced by H$\\alpha$) is between $0.5~M_{\\odot}~\\rm yr^{-1}$ and $5~M_{\\odot}~\\rm yr^{-1}$, depending on $n_e(z)$ assumptions. From ALMA/ACA observations, we place an upper-limit on CO flux in the outflow which correlates to $\\lesssim2.9~M_{\\odot}~\\rm yr^{-1}$. We also show that the entire outflow is not limited to the bicone, but a secondary starburst at the edge generates a more widespread outflow, which should be included in simulations. The cool gas in NGC 4666 wind has insufficient velocity to escape the halo of a galaxy of its mass, especially because most of the mass is present in the slower atomic phase. This strong biconical wind contributes to gas cycling around the galaxy.",

To constrain the origin of 3I/ATLAS and its past dynamical evolution, we propagate the orbits of 3I/ATLAS and nearby stars to search for stellar encounters. Integrating orbits in the Galactic potential and propagating the astrometric and radial-velocity uncertainties of 30 million Gaia stars, we identify 25 encounters with median encounter distances less than 1 pc. However, because the encounter speeds between 3I/ATLAS and each encounter exceed 20 km/s, none is a plausible host under common ejection mechanisms. We infer stellar masses for most stars and quantify the gravitational perturbations exerted by each individual star or each binary system on 3I/ATLAS. The strongest gravitational scattering perturber is a wide M-dwarf binary. Among all past encounters, the binary's barycenter and 3I/ATLAS reach the small encounter distance of 0.242 pc and the encounter speed of 28.39 km/s,1.64 Myr ago. We further demonstrate that the cumulative influence of the stellar encounters on both the speed and direction of 3I/ATLAS is weak. Based on the present kinematics of 3I/ATLAS to assess its origin, we find that a thin-disk origin is strongly favored, because the thin disk both exhibits a velocity distribution closely matching that of 3I/ATLAS and provides the dominant local number density of stars.",

Fixed aperture photometry of the comet is well described by a power law function of heliocentric distance, rH, with the exponent (``index\") n = 3.8+/-0.3 across the 4.6 au to 1.8 au distance range (phase function 0.04+/-0.02 magnitude/degree assumed). This indicates that the dust production rates vary in proportion to rH**(-1.8+/-0.3). An rH**(-2) variation is expected of a strongly volatile material, and consistent with independent spectroscopic observations showing that carbon dioxide is the primary driver of activity. The measured heliocentric index is unremarkable in the context of solar system comets, for which n is widely dispersed, and provides no basis on which to describe 3I as either dynamically old (thermally processed) or new (pristine). The morphology of the comet changes from a Sun-facing dust fan in the early 2025 July observations, to one dominated by an antisolar dust tail at later dates. We attribute the delayed emergence of the tail to the large size (effective radius 0.1 mm) and slow ejection (5 m/s) of the optically dominant dust particles, and their consequently sluggish response to solar radiation pressure. Small (micron-sized) particles may be present but not in numbers sufficient to dominate the scattering cross-section. Their relative depletion possibly reflects interparticle cohesion, which binds small particles more effectively than large ones. A similar preponderance of 0.1 mm grains was reported in 2I/Borisov. However, 2I differed from 3I in having a much smaller (asteroid-like) heliocentric index, n = 1.9+/-0.1. Dust production rates in 3I are 180 kg/s at 2 au, compared with 70 kg/s in 2I/Borisov at the same distance.",

Fernández-Trincado, Keivan G. Stassun, Julio Chanamé Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Recent Gaia-based young stellar association surveys have revealed dozens of low-mass populations that have, until recently, been too small or sparse to detect. These populations represent a largely unstudied demographic with unknown origins, and their relative isolation may minimize gravitational disruptions that impact traceback, making them compelling targets for dynamical studies. In this paper, we survey 15 of these isolated young associations for the first time: Andromeda South (SCYA-97), Aquila East, Aries South (SCYA-104), Cassiopeia East (SCYA-43), Canis Major North, Leo Central (SCYA-2), Leo East (SCYA-3), Theia 72, Ophiuchus Southeast, Scutum North (SCYA-70), Taurus-Orion 1 (TOR1), Theia 78, Vulpecula East (UPK 88), SCYA-54, and SCYA-79. By combining Gaia astrometry and photometry with new ground-based spectroscopic measurements, we assess the membership of each population, search for substructure, analyze their demographics, and compute ages. We find that the smallest populations in our sample contain $<20$ $M_{\\odot}$ of stellar mass, making them the smallest associations ever detected. Four host substantial substructure, including TOR1, where we discover TOR1B, a new 9 $M_{\\odot}$ association with radial velocities inconsistent with an origin in the parent complex. Using PARSEC isochrones, we produce self-consistent ages for all populations supported by dynamical and lithium depletion ages, which range from 6.9 $\\pm$ 0.5 Myr in TOR1 to 42.8 $\\pm$ 2.4 in AndS. Our results provide the first detailed overview of the properties of these populations, characterizing a largely unknown category of young associations that may have an important role in tracing the processes that guide local star formation.",

We explore whether the \\bl\\ dynamo can produce Rieger-type periodicity and QBOs and investigate their underlying physical mechanisms. We use the observationally guided three-dimensional kinematic \\bl\\ dynamo model, which has emerged as a successful model for reproducing many characteristic features of the solar cycle. We use Morlet wavelet and global wavelet power spectrum techniques to analyze the data obtained from the model. In our model, we report QBOs and Rieger-type periods for the first time. Further, we investigate the individual \\bl\\ parameters (fluctuations in flux, latitude, time delay and tilt scatter) role in the occurrence of QBOs and Rieger-type periods. We find that while fluctuations in the individual parameters of the \\bl\\ process can produce QBOs and Rieger-type periodicity, their occurrence probability is enhanced when we consider combined fluctuations of all parameters in the \\bl\\ process. Finally, we find that with the increase of dynamo supercriticality, the model tends to suppress the generation of Rieger-type periodicity. Thus, this result supports earlier studies that suggest the solar dynamo is not highly supercritical.",

They are characterized by their large amplitude, high gravity, and long periods (2-75 minutes). Some BLAPs exhibit a rich helium abundance on their surfaces, while some of the others show rich hydrogen atmospheres. Up to date, both the mode identification and formation pathways of BLAPs remain subjects of ongoing debate. In this work, we gave an non-adiabatic pulsation analyses for low-order radial and non-radial dipole modes on a theoretical model grid to explore the characterist ics of BLAPs. The effects of element diffusion and radiative levitation are not taken into account our theoretical models. This because that these processes could lead to discrepancies in surface element abundance of the sdB or BLAP stars between theoretical models and observations. Based on the theoretical model grid, our analyses revealed that the radial fundamental modes align well with various observed properties of BLAPs, including the pulsation instability, the position of the excitable models on the HR diagram, surface element compositions, period ranges, and period changes. Our theoretical models also predicted a period-gravity ($\\log g$) relation with a narrow distribution, while the observations exhibit a broader range. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the excitation of pulsation in BLAPs is primarily influenced by metal abundance. The thickness of the outer rich hydrogen envelope and the ratio of helium to hydrogen on the surface almost do not affect the pulsation instability.",

O - C analysis indicates no long-term variation in V0844 Aur. However, the orbital periods of the other three targets are increasing. We conclude that V0844 Aur, V0699 Cep and NSVS 6259046 are magnetically active, as evidenced by the presence and variable nature of the O'Connell effect in these systems. By analyzing the LAMOST spectroscopic data, we find out that NSVS 6259046 and V0508 And exhibit no chromospheric activity on the dates the LAMOST spectra were taken, while the low signal-to-noise ratio in LAMOST data for V0844 Aur prevents us from obtaining reliable results. We discover that V0699 Cep is an early-type contact binary with chromospheric activity. Their initial masses and ages are calculated. All four systems are determined to be currently stable.

Clare Worley Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Magnesium (Mg) isotopic ratios offer valuable insights into stellar nucleosynthesis and Galactic chemical evolution, particularly in distinguishing contributions from supernovae and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. These isotopes are accessible via MgH molecular features in cool stellar atmospheres, though their measurement remains challenging across spectral types. We assess the reliability of MgH spectral regions for extracting magnesium isotopic ratios ($^{24}$Mg, $^{25}$Mg, $^{26}$Mg) in stars from M to G types and evaluate consistency with nucleosynthetic expectations. Using spectrum synthesis, we applied an analysis pipeline, validated by three well-studied reference stars, to a sample of five additional dwarf and giant stars. Individual MgH band regions were analysed for sensitivity to isotopic variation. Europium (Eu) and barium (Ba) abundances were also measured to explore correlations with Mg isotopic ratios as r- and s-process proxies. Of ten previously studied MgH wavelength regions, we identify seven as most reliable for isotopic analysis; others showed limited sensitivity across stellar types. Derived Mg isotope ratios ($^{24}$Mg, $^{25}$Mg, $^{26}$Mg) include: HD 11695-81:7:12; HD 18884-81:7:12; HD 18907-69:9:23; HD 22049-71:16:13; HD 23249-66:13:22; HD 128621-67:17:16; HD 10700-78:10:12; HD 100407-65:10:25. Comparison of Eu abundances with Mg isotopes reveals strong correlations, particularly with ($^{24}$Mg, which is predominantly produced by hydrostatic $\\alpha$-capture in massive stars, a process preceding the r-process responsible for Eu. In contrast, Ba shows no significant correlation with $^{25}$Mg or $^{26}$Mg, despite their shared s-process origin. Our results demonstrate that selected MgH regions can reliably measure Mg isotopes in cool stars, providing a reproducible framework for future studies of stellar nucleosynthesis and Galactic chemical evolution.",

The development of reliable forecasting methodologies of these events depends on robust flare catalogs, but current methods are limited to flare classification using integrated soft X-ray emission that are available only from Earth's perspective. This reduces accuracy in pinpointing the location and strength of farside flares and their connection to geoeffective events. In this work, we introduce a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based approach that translates Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) observations into soft x-ray flux while also setting the groundwork for estimating flare locations in the future. The model achieves accurate flux predictions across flare classes using quantitative metrics. This paves the way for EUV-based flare detection to be extended beyond Earth's line of sight, which allows for a more comprehensive and complete solar flare catalog.",

Vorobyov, Alexandr Skliarevskii, Michihiro Takami Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We investigated the possibility of determining the mechanism of the FU Orionis-type outburst based on molecular line observations of protoplanetary disks with synthetic observations of distinct numerical burst models. The morphology of the synthetic $\\mathrm{C^{18}O}$ emission is sensitive to gas temperature and does not coincide with the actual gas disk structures, particularly in the magnetorotational instability (MRI) and clump-infall models, which exhibit peculiar temperature distributions. This highlights the need for careful interpretation of morphologies of line emission from disks under accretion outbursts. The synthetic $\\mathrm{C^{18}O}$ emission of each model exhibits distinct kinematic features that can be used to distinguish outburst scenarios. In the MRI model, kinematic features of the gravitational instability (GI), which fuels MRI-driven accretion bursts, are small in both amplitude and spatial extent, resulting in no prominent local features in the residual velocity map at a typical distance for FU Orionis-type objects. In contrast, the clump-infall model shows a clear sign of gas expansion along a spiral, which is caused by exchange of angular momentum between an infalling clump and surrounding gas. The intruder model exhibits a highly asymmetric velocity structure with respect to the systemic velocity of the primary protostar in velocity channel maps. These distinct kinematic features may serve as promising diagnostics for distinguishing the physical mechanisms responsible for FU Orionis-type outbursts.",

Because NEF typically emerges adjacent to filaments, it imposes magnetic asymmetry that can drive non-radial eruptions and complicate space-weather forecasting. We bridge analytic catastrophe theory with 2D resistive MHD simulations: analytic solutions provide magnetic configurations containing a flux rope at the loss-of-equilibrium point, which are then used as initial conditions for simulations to examine the following dynamics. We find that NEF governs the kinematics of filament eruptions in two ways. First, by reshaping coronal stability, NEF can create or eliminate a higher equilibrium in corona, thereby producing failed eruptions or CMEs. In the transitional situation where a metastable equilibrium appears, the rising filament decelerates and stalls before re-accelerating into a CME, consistent with observed two-step eruptions. Second, by breaking symmetry, NEF deflects eruptions away from the radial direction: depending on its polarity, it acts as a repulsor or an attractor on eruptive filaments, and the deflection magnitude increases with the degree of asymmetry. Our theory yields two characteristic angles that predict the deflection directions of CMEs and failed eruptions, and simulations closely aligns with these predictors. These results highlight the NEF not only as a trigger but also as a key factor that governs both the acceleration and deflection of eruptions during their propagation in the low corona.",

Louis Accepted for publication in Solar Physics, 23 pages, 9 figures, 1 appendix figure Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Sunspots or active regions (ARs) with a delta-magnetic configuration are known to be associated with strong eruptions such as flares and mass ejections. This article investigates the relationship between delta-ARs and flares over the course of three solar cycles (SCs), from 1996 to 2024, with respect to the former's area, lifetime, latitudinal distribution, and phase of its magnetic complexity. Solar cycle 25 has produced the least number of delta-ARs in comparison to the previous two solar cycles, yet the number of M- and X-class flares exceed that of cycle 24 by 25%. Flare occurrence is higher in C-, M-, and X-class events during the presence of the delta-configuration which is seen in all 3 SCs. The total number of flares produced by delta- and non-delta-ARs were 15875 and 17033, respectively across all 3 SCs. The latter are dominated by B- and C-class flares, while the number of M- and X-class flares across all 3 SCs was significantly less than compared to delta-ARs. The median lifetime of an AR in the delta- and non-delta phase is about 5 and 8 days, respectively. The typical number of flares produced by a delta-AR is 20, with maximum values ranging from 80-156 for lifetimes between 6-13 days. However, about 30% of delta-ARs do not produce flares when their lifetimes are between 6-12 days. The latitudinal distribution of delta-ARs across the northern and southern hemispheres is nearly symmetric on either side of the equator for SCs 23 and 24, peaking around +/-10 deg-20 deg. For solar cycles 23 and 24, about 30% of the host delta-ARs have an area exceeding the mean value over the above latitudinal belt while for SC 25, there is a large scatter possibly due to the cycle still being in progress. It remains to be seen if the latter phase of SC 25 will be as active as its earlier phase and whether the number of delta-ARs emerging during that period scale with the total sunspot number.",

The interplay between surface magnetic topology and chromospheric heating in active M dwarfs remains poorly constrained, limiting our understanding of their magnetic cycles and high-energy environments. Aims. We aim to test whether detailed Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI) maps of AD Leo can be used to spatially anchor a multi-component chromospheric model and validate the link between magnetic flux distribution and emission-line formation. Methods. We analyze high-resolution CARMENES spectra of H-alpha and the Ca II infrared triplet, together with ZDI maps. Synthetic profiles are computed using the RH1.5D non-LTE radiative transfer code with two active atmospheric components (low-latitude near the equator and polar near the pole) and a quiet background. Their relative filling factors and temperature structures are optimized per epoch. The ZDI maps serve as qualitative references for the large-scale magnetic topology but are not used as input to the optimization. Results. Our model reproduces the spectral line profiles across multiple epochs. The low-latitude active region shows notable variability, accounting for approximately 55-86% of the emission, while the polar region remains relatively constant in area (12-17%) but exhibits temperature variations over time, particularly during periods of increased activity. The spatial locations of the active regions derived from spectroscopy agree well with the radial magnetic field distribution from ZDI. Conclusions. Combining spectroscopic modeling with magnetic field maps is an effective approach for mapping magneto-chromospheric structures in M dwarfs. This framework deepens our understanding of stellar magnetic cycles and chromospheric dynamics, paving the way for detailed time-resolved studies in active low-mass stars.",

Stellar coronae are unresolved in X-rays, so inferences about their structure rely on spectral analysis. The \"Sun-as-an-X-ray-star\" (SaXS) approach uses the Sun as a spatially resolved template to interpret stellar spectra, but previous SaXS implementations were indirect and computationally heavy. Aims. We present a new SaXS implementation that converts solar emission measure distributions (EMDs) of distinct coronal region types into XSPEC spectral components and test whether broad-band X-ray spectra alone can recover their filling factors. Methods. We built XSPEC multi-temperature spectral models for four solar region types (background/quiet corona, active regions, cores, and flares) by using EMDs derived from Yohkoh/SXT data and translating each EMD bin into an isothermal apec component. These models were fit (using PyXspec) to two one-hour DAXSS spectra representative of quiescent (2022-06-29) and flaring (2022-04-25) states. Best-fit normalizations were converted into projected areas and filling factors and compared with near-coincident Hinode/XRT full-disk images. Results. Using the Yohkoh/SXT EMDs, the quiescent Sun spectrum is dominated by active region emission (filling factor ~22%), with the background corona poorly constrained. The flaring Sun spectrum is best described by a combination of active regions, cores, and flares with filling factors of ~47.5%, ~4.1%, and ~0.062%, respectively. The dominant components match spatial features seen in Hinode/XRT images. Limitations include the DAXSS low-energy cutoff (~0.7 keV) and the small, non-uniform Yohkoh EMD sample. Conclusions. Our SaXS implementation enables direct retrieval of coronal filling factors from broad-band X-ray spectra and provides a physically motivated alternative to ad hoc few-temperature fits, suitable for stellar X-ray analyses.",

Gameiro, M. Gangi Accepted for publication in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Magnetic winds are a key mechanism for angular momentum removal in young stars. In this work, we aim at characterizing the multi-component outflow of RU Lup. The unprecedented high resolution of the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanets and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO) enabled a detailed study of the forbidden emission lines and the blueshifted absorption in the lines of the Na I and Ca II doublets, which we resolved in three discrete absorption components at low, medium, and high velocities. We developed a method that disentangles vertical and toroidal velocities in the absorption components and infers the wind launching radius, magnetic lever arm, and mass-loss rate. We identified a low-velocity broad component in the [O I] 5577 line, consistent with a rotating magnetohydrodynamic disk wind launched near the disk truncation radius. We showed that the discrete absorption components trace spatially and physically distinct regions of the outflow. The medium and low velocity components are launched from the inner disk (< 6.76 stellar radii) with low lever arms indicative of warm, highly mass-loaded streamlines. However, the two components differ mainly in vertical velocity. The low velocity absorption is consistent with an outer absorbing shell, while the medium velocity absorption forms near the disk truncation radius. Its higher vertical velocity is compatible with either a slightly larger lever arm, or additional heating at the base of the flow. For plausible ionization levels in the inner disk, this outflow component removes a substantial fraction of the accretion spin-up torque. In conclusion, our work shows that RU Lup hosts a stratified, rotating, warm disk wind launched across a narrow annulus near the disk truncation radius, which is sufficiently mass-loaded to extract a large amount of the stellar spin-up torque. The observations disfavor an X-wind scenario.",

Their fine-scale structure provides a valuable tool for probing the dynamics of the flare reconnection process. Our goal is to investigate the fine-scale structure of flare ribbons through multiple observations of flares, utilising data obtained from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST). The aligned AIA and SST datasets for the three solar flares were used to examine their overall morphology. The SST datasets were specifically used to identify fine-scale structures within the flare ribbons. For spectroscopic analysis of these fine structures, we applied machine-learning methods (k-means clustering) and Gaussian fitting. Using k-means, we identified elongated features in the flare ribbons, termed as \"riblets\", which are short-lived and jet-like small-scale structures that extend as plasma columns from the flare ribbons. Riblets are more prominent near the solar limb and represent the ribbon front. Riblet widths are consistent across observations, ranging from 110-310 km (0\".15-0\".41), while vertical lengths span 620-1220 km (0\".83-1\".66), with a potential maximum of 2000 km (2\".67), after accounting for projection effects. Detailed H-beta spectral analysis reveals that riblets exhibit a single, redshifted emission component, with velocities of 16-21 km s^1, independent of viewing angle. Our high-resolution observations of the three flare ribbons show that they are not continuous structures, but are composed of vertically extended, fine-scale substructures. These irregular features indicate that the reconnection region is not a smooth, laminar current sheet, but rather a fragmented zone filled with magnetic islands, consistent with the theory of patchy reconnection within the coronal current sheet.",

Currently, estimates of the power generated by SPMI primarily rely on analytical scaling laws that relate stellar and planetary parameters to the interaction energetics. The existing scaling laws published in the literature so far do not agree with each other by at least an order of magnitude. Our aim is to quantify an absolute upper limit on the power that a planet can channel back to its host star during such interactions, which in turn lead to the formation of stellar hotspots. By performing a series of 3D MHD simulations with varied parameters known to influence the energetics of SPMI, we derive a numerically supported scaling law that can be used to reliably estimate the energy channeled from the planet back to the star. Our results suggest that existing analytical scaling laws may not fully capture the power transferred from the planet to the star through SPMI. The scaling law derived from our numerical simulations appears to provide a more comprehensive estimate, reflecting dependencies on common stellar and planetary parameters also considered in earlier models. Moreover, our findings indicate that power generation involves not only the planetary obstacle itself but also the extended magnetic structure of the Alfven wings interacting with the streaming stellar wind. This study suggests that care should be taken when applying analogies directly from jovian sub-Alfvenic interactions to SPMI, as the underlying physical conditions (specifically the value of the Alfvenic Mach number) may not be directly comparable. Our numerically derived scaling law offers a potentially improved approach for estimating SPMI power, capturing some of the interaction's complexities exclusive to SPMI.",

Koulidiati Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Stellar rotation is a fundamental parameter in stellar studies. However, large homogeneous catalogues of rotational velocities derived from high-resolution stellar spectra are still lacking. The main objective of this work is to determine the line-broadening parameter (Vbroad), a proxy for the stellar rotational velocity, in a large sample of FGKM stars based on their ESO/FEROS spectra, previously parameterised by the AMBRE Project. Vbroad was estimated by cross-correlating the FEROS spectra with AMBRE binary masks. This methodology also relies on a specific calibration of a coupling constant between the rotational velocity and the width of the cross-correlation function. This fundamental step was performed by adopting the AMBRE grid of synthetic spectra. The derived Vbroad were then validated using data from the literature, ground-based spectroscopic surveys, and Gaia/RVS. After analysing more than 5,000 FEROS spectra (including repeated spectra for several stars), we obtained the line-broadening coefficients for 2,584 stars covering the FGKM spectral types, any stellar gravity, and metallicities between the metal-poor up to sub-solar regimes. The mean Vbroad relative uncertainty of this sample was found to be smaller than 8%. As expected, most stars were found to be slow rotators (below a few km/s), in particular, cool dwarfs and giants. However, several hot dwarfs and high-luminosity stars with high-Vbroad rates were identified, most of them not previously classified as fast rotators and/or affected by large macro-turbulent effects. The measured rotational broadening values are of high-quality and verified on the basis of literature comparisons. We publicly provide this catalogue of Vbroad parameters, including stellar atmospheric and quality parameters, for the analysed AMBRE/FEROS sources.",

Most codes developed during that time use the anelastic approximation, which fixes the thermal structure of simulations and filters out sound waves. Many of them also use explicit time integration, which imposes severe constraints on the time step of the simulations. In this context, MUSIC is developed to overcome these limitations. Its main scientific objective is to improve the phenomenological approaches used in 1D stellar evolution codes to describe major hydrodynamical and MHD processes. Here, we review recent applications of the MUSIC code, that focus mainly on convection, convective boundary mixing and waves in stars that possess convective cores, shells and/or envelopes.",

While the core accretion paradigm is widely accepted as the dominant mechanism for forming low- and intermediate-mass planets, the origin of the most massive planets remains debated, with gravitational instability often invoked to explain their existence. In this study, we analyze the dependence of planet formation on metallicity using the total heavy-element mass fraction (Z), which is a proxy for the composition of the protoplanetary disk inferred from stellar photospheres. We show that even the most massive planets form preferentially in metal-rich environments. Z correlates not only with the presence of planets, but also with planetary system multiplicity and total planetary mass. The most massive planets are found in the most metal-rich environments, and, in agreement with core-accretion theory, only the upper end of the planetary mass distribution shows a clear positive correlation with metallicity. These findings suggest that the chemical enrichment of protoplanetary disks plays a central role in shaping the full spectrum of planetary masses.",

Springer Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) This chapter reviews the definition of exoplanets and of brown dwarfs. Emphasis is given to the separation of these two populations. A traditional view is to declare « planet » objects with a mass < 13 M Jup and « brown dwarf » objects with a mass > 13 M Jup . By analogy with Solar System planets, a better definition is to call « planets » objects formed by accretion of dust and planetesimals in a disk. An by extension of the primitive introduction of the word « brown dwarf » for failed stars by Jill Tarter, this term must be reserved to objects formed by gravitational collapse in a molecular gas cloud. The two definitions do not coincide since a « brown dwarf » can have a mass down to about 6 Jupiter mass. And there is no physical reason to assert that a 20 Jupiter mass object has not been formed by accretion. From there, the difficulty is to decide if an object of say 20 Jupiter mass is formed by dust accretion or by gravitational collapse. A future observational test to solve this difficulty is presented.",

Our analysis evaluates three recent foundational models - SigLIP2 for image encoding, VideoMAE for spatio-temporal video representation, and Moirai2 for multivariate time-series forecasting - applied to publicly available datasets of solar magnetograms from the SDO/HMI mission and soft X-ray fluxes acquired by GOES satellites. All models are trained and validated under consistent data splits and evaluation criteria, with the goal of assessing the strengths and limitations of transformer backbones across spatial and temporal representations of solar activity. We investigate multiple loss formulations (weighted BCE, focal, and score-oriented) and training balance strategies to mitigate class imbalance typical of flare datasets. Results show that while both SigLIP2 and VideoMAE achieve typical performance on image and video data (True Skill Statistic TSS~0.60-0.65), the time-series model Moirai2 reaches superior forecasting skill (TSS~0.74) using irradiance-based temporal evolution alone. These findings highlight the potential of pretrained transformer architectures and cross-modal learning for advancing operational space weather forecasting, paving the way toward unified multimodal models that integrate visual and temporal information.",

Using hydromagnetic mean-field simulations of $\\alpha\\Omega$-type dynamos in rotating shearing-periodic boxes, we show that for negative shear, the MRI can operate above a certain critical shear parameter. This parameter scales inversely with the equipartition magnetic field strength above which $\\alpha$ quenching set in. Like the usual $\\Omega$ effect, the MRI produces toroidal magnetic field when the field is sufficiently strong. The work done by the Lorentz force is positive, so the magnetic field drives kinetic energy and not the other way around, as in a turbulent dynamo. This results in strong kinetic energy production and dissipation, which occurs at the expense of the magnetic energy. In view of the application to the solar NSSL, we conclude that the turbulent magnetic diffusivity may be too large for the MRI to be excited and that therefore only the standard $\\Omega$ effect is expected to operate.",

Arge Accepted of publication in ApJL. 10 pages, 7 figures. Associated dataset, codes and Python package are available Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) The Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model has been the cornerstone of operational solar wind forecasting for nearly two decades, owing to its simplicity and physics-based formalism. However, its performance is strongly dependent on several empirical parameters that are typically fixed or tuned manually, limiting its adaptability across varying solar conditions. In this study, we present a neural enhancement to the WSA framework (referred to as WSA+) that systematically optimizes the empirical parameters of the WSA solar wind speed relation using in-situ observations within a differentiable physics-constrained pipeline. The approach operates in two stages: first, a neural optimizer adjusts WSA parameters independently for each Carrington Rotation to better match the observed solar wind data. Then, a neural network learns to predict these optimized speed maps directly from magnetogram-derived features. This enables generalization of the optimization process and allows inference for new solar conditions without manual tuning. The developed WSA+ preserves the interpretability of the original relation while significantly improving the match with OMNI in-situ data across multiple performance metrics, including correlation and error statistics. It consistently outperforms the traditional WSA relation across both low and high solar activity periods, with average improvements of approximately 40 percent. By integrating data-driven learning with physical constraints, WSA+ offers a robust and adaptable enhancement, with immediate utility as a drop-in replacement in global heliospheric modeling pipelines.",

Matthaeus, Sohom Roy, Barbara J. Thompson Accepted for publication in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) Fluctuations in the Sun's photospheric magnetic field are the primary source of the turbulence that can heat and accelerate the solar atmosphere, and thus play an important role in the production and evolution of the solar wind that permeates the heliosphere. A key parameter that characterizes this turbulence is the correlation scale of fluctuations, which determines the injection of turbulent energy into the plasma and the diffusive transport of solar energetic particles. This study employs magnetogram data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on the Solar Dynamics Observatory to characterize an ensemble of spatial autocorrelation functions (ACFs) of turbulence in the photosphere. It is shown that the two-point ACFs satisfy the similarity-decay hypothesis of von Kármán and Howarth, a fundamental property of turbulent systems: rescaling the ACFs by their respective energies and correlation lengths yields a quasi-universal exponential form. The probability distribution function of transverse correlation lengths (\\(\\lambda\\)) is shown to be approximately log-normal, which is consistent with observations of turbulence in the solar wind. A ``mosaic'' of the spatial distribution of \\(\\lambda\\) over the photosphere is presented; the ``quiet Sun'' tends to have \\(\\lambda\\sim 1500\\) km (albeit with a wide distribution), which is close to the scale of solar granulation; systematically longer lengths are associated with active regions. A positive correlation is observed between mean magnetic field magnitude and \\(\\lambda\\), and empirical fits quantify this relationship. These results improve our understanding of solar turbulence while providing observational constraints for models that describe turbulence transport from solar and stellar photospheres into their atmospheres.",

These nebular spectra are dominated by asymmetric emission lines from atomic species including H, Ca, Ar, C, Mg, Ni, Co, and Fe, indicative of an aspherical explosion. The other strong features are molecular CO vibrational bands from the fundamental and first overtone. We introduce a novel, data-driven approach using non-LTE 3D radiative transfer simulations to model the CO emission with high fidelity. This method enables us to constrain the three-dimensional CO distribution and its radial temperature structure. CO formation is found to occur prior to day +285, with subsequent evolution characterized by progressive evaporation. The CO mass decreases from approximately 8.7 to 1.3*E-3 Mo, while the average temperature drops from about 2900 K to 2500 K. Concurrently, the CO distribution transitions from nearly homogeneous to highly clumped (density contrast increasing from fc=1.2 to 2). The minimum velocity of the CO-emitting region remains nearly constant (v1 = 1200 to 1100 km/s), significantly above the receding photosphere velocity (v(ph) = 500 km/s), suggesting the photosphere resides within Si-rich layers. However, the temperature profile indicates that only a narrow zone reaches the conditions necessary for SiO formation. Due to a lack of observational constraints, SiO clumping is not modeled, and thus, synthetic SiO profiles for mass estimates are not highlighted. We discuss the implications of these findings for dust formation processes in SN~2024ggi.",

While the stellar components usually display similar masses, some binaries with extremely low mass ratios were also observed. Some of them are primordial, while others arise from binary interactions. The identification of systems with extreme mass ratios brings valuable information, notably on the origin of fast rotation in massive stars. We identify new short-period systems with extreme mass ratios through the detection of eclipses and reflection effects. The physical properties of a dozen newly identified cases were precisely evaluated through high-quality photometry and spectroscopy. In addition to characterizing these binaries, we found a clear signature of apsidal motion in one system, and three other systems display long-term shifts in eclipse times. All systems we reported here are composed of a massive star and a cool low-mass companion. They are therefore primordial cases. This doubles the known number of these systems in the Galaxy. In this context, it is important to note that most massive stars in these systems, as well as in previous systems reported in the literature, rotate fast (supersynchronous compared to the orbital motion). The high incidence of fast rotation in these nascent binaries provides strong constraints for star formation models.",

As a recently discovered class of radial-mode pulsators, the origin and nature of these variables remain the subject of ongoing investigations. Here, we present a comprehensive summary of all BLAPs identified in the data of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE), including the discovery of 88 new BLAPs in the inner Galactic bulge fields. We performed a systematic search for periodic signals in the $I$-band light curves of more than 400 million stars with magnitudes down to $I = 21$. Our search effectively doubles the number of these variables to almost 200. The detected BLAPs exhibit pulsation periods between roughly 5 and 76 minutes. The analyzed dataset covers a timespan from 2001 to 2024, with some stars observed up to 20,000 times, providing the temporal coverage needed to study period and amplitude variations. We report on three objects that show enormous period changes, at a rate of $10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$, which could provide important clues to the evolutionary status of BLAPs.

The two dominant interpretations favor hot exozodiacal dust or a faint companion, as both can produce similar signatures. Method: We modeled a system consisting of a star and a faint companion within a field of view of 2au x 2au. We calculated the visibility and closure phases for three VLTI instruments (PIONIER, GRAVITY, and MATISSE) and four telescope configurations. Aim: We aim to investigate the interferometric signatures of faint companions and assess their detectability. We explore limitations of current detection methods and evaluate the challenges in distinguishing between hot exozodiacal dust and a faint companion as the source of the observed excess. Results: We derived an upper limit for the companion-induced visibility deficit and closure phase. Contrary to the common interpretation that near-zero closure phases rule out the presence of a companion, we show that companions can remain undetected in closure phase data, as indicated by significant non-detection probabilities, yet, these companions can still produce measurable visibility deficits. We confirmed our results by reevaluating an L-band observation of kappa Tuc A. We found indications for a faint companion with a flux ratio of 0.7% and an estimated non-detection probability of around 21%, which could explain the variability of the previously observed visibility deficit. Conclusions: Previous companion rejection criteria, such as near-zero closure phases and flux estimates based on Gaussian-distributed dust densities, are not universally valid. This highlights the need for a reevaluation of companion rejections in former studies of the hot exozodiacal dust phenomenon. In addition, we propose a method for distinguishing both sources of visibility deficit.",

In brief, PLACID consists in a fore-optics coronagraphic intermediate stage platform, installed in-between the TROIA XAO system and the DIRAC HAWAII-1RG focal-plane array. The PLACID instrument was delivered to ATASAM campus facilities in March of 2024, and transported to summit in October of 2024. In February of 2025, the PLACID optical breadboard was craned to the DAG observatory floor, and successfully installed on the optical table of the diffraction-limited Nasmyth platform of the 4-m telescope. Following the official DAG Acceptance milestone in the spring of 2025, Assembly, Integration and Validation (AIV) activities have started in July of 2025, when PLACID was cabled up with all active components fully interfaced and tested for functional integrity. When on-sky by early 2026, PLACID will be the world's first active coronagraph system, fielding a customized spatial light modulator (SLM) acting as a dynamically programmable focal-plane phase mask (FPM) coronagraph from H- to Ks-band. This will provide a wealth of novel options to observers, among which software-only abilities to change or re-align the FPM pattern in function of observational conditions or science requirements. Future features will include non-common path aberrations (NCPA) self-calibration, angular differential imaging (ADI) coronagraphy for binary or triple stars, as well as coherent differential imaging (CDI). We hereby present the PLACID AIV activities that have taken place over the last twelve months, and the next steps for commissioning the instrument internally, and on-sky later this year.",

However, the UVIS encircled energy (EE) varies with detector position and focus variations on orbital timescales for aperture radii less than 10 pixels ($\\sim$0.4 arcseconds). Using a set of focus-diverse empirical PSFs by Anderson (2018), we compute 2D spatial maps of the aperture correction between 5-10 pixels and find a maximum change of $\\sim$0.01 mag over all focus levels for a given detector position. The upper-left and lower-right corners of the UVIS detector are more focus-sensitive than the rest of the field of view, where the mean correction is systematically $\\sim$0.01 mag higher in Amp A for bluer filters (F275W, F336W, F438W) and $\\sim$0.01 mag higher in Amp D for redder filters (F606W, F814W) at all focus levels. We test the new aperture correction maps in globular clusters, and we find reduced scatter, better agreement between the two CCDs, and a small shift in the absolute photometry when compared to a single (constant) aperture correction per image. These improvements are specific to photometry with apertures $<$ 10 pixels in radius; results from larger apertures are not affected. Using published EE tables can introduce systematic uncertainties in absolute photometry due to its tendency to vary with detector position and focus level, with larger errors for smaller apertures. Users requiring photometric accuracy better than $\\sim$1% for small apertures can use isolated stars in the individual FLT/FLC frames (or PSF cutouts at a similar detector position and focus level) to compute encircled energy corrections and accurately account for the amount of flux at radii larger than their photometric apertures.",

Stutzer Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We describe a time-domain technique for separating $1/f$ gain fluctuations and continuum signal for a total power spectrometer, such as the CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder instrument. The $1/f$ gain fluctuations of such a system are expected to be common-mode across frequency channels. If the instrument's system temperature is not constant across channels, a continuum signal will exhibit a frequency dependence different from that of common-mode gain fluctuations. Our technique leverages this difference to fit a three-parameter frequency model to each time sample in the time-domain data, separating gain and continuum. We show that this technique can be applied to the COMAP Pathfinder instrument, which exhibits a series of temporally stable resonant noise spikes that effectively act as calibrators, breaking the gain degeneracy with continuum signals. Using both simulations and observations of Jupiter, we explore the effect of a $1/f$ prior for the gain model. We show that the model is capable of cleanly separating Jupiter, a bright continuum source, from the gain fluctuations in the scan. The technique has two applications to COMAP. For the COMAP observations performing line intensity mapping (LIM), the technique better suppresses atmospheric fluctuations and foregrounds than the COMAP LIM pipeline. For the Galactic COMAP observations, which map Galactic continuum signals, the technique can suppress $1/f$ gain fluctuations while retaining all continuum signals. This is demonstrated by the latest COMAP observations of $\\lambda$-Orionis, where our method produces far cleaner maps than a destriper alone, typically reducing the noise power by a factor of 7 on beam scales and up to 15 on larger scales.",

Kezerashvili Popular Physics (physics.pop-ph); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Propellantless propulsion refers to methods of space travel that do not require onboard propellant, instead relying on natural forces or external energy sources. In this paper, I review different approaches that have been explored and discuss the pros and cons of each method for interstellar space exploration. Gravitational assist uses planetary gravity to change a spacecraft's speed and direction without fuel. It is effective but limited to specific alignments. Solar sails harness radiation pressure from sunlight for continuous, fuel-free acceleration. While effective over time, they require large, reflective materials that degrade in space. Speed can be enhanced by thermal desorption triggered by solar radiation. Magnetic sails generate thrust by interacting with the solar wind through superconducting loops that produce a magnetic field. They provide lower acceleration compared to solar sails, and their performance depends on the available power and the variability of solar wind conditions. Electric sails utilize charged tethers to repel solar wind protons, producing gradual acceleration. Their effectiveness depends on the successful deployment of very long, lightweight conductive wires. They can achieve higher acceleration than solar sails, and their performance is influenced by available power and solar wind conditions. Lastly, quantum effects, such as the Casimir force, offer a speculative but intriguing route to propellantless propulsion based on the vacuum energy of space.",

Robinson Accepted for publication in ApJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) A next generation of space-based observatories aims to detect and characterize potentially Earth-like exoplanets around Sun-like stars using reflected light spectroscopy. However, it remains unclear how such direct imaging observations$-$limited in spectral coverage and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N)$-$translate into constraints on atmospheric composition and habitability. Coronagraphs used for high-contrast imaging typically operate over narrow bandpasses, and exposure time limits can restrict data quality. To optimize observing strategies and instrument design, we use our atmospheric retrieval tool, $\\texttt{rfast}$, to assess the performance of a $\\mathit{Habitable\\ Worlds\\ Observatory}$-type mission across different spectral bandpasses (\"Red\", \"Blue\", \"Visible\", \"NIR\", and their combination) and S/N levels (10, 15, and 20; from moderate to moderate-high observation quality) in retrieving a wide range of 17 atmospheric, surface, bulk, and orbital parameters of a habitable Earth analog. We outline the observation requirements for each parameter and the detection capabilities of each case, within a novel scenario where spectral data are taken \"early\", prior to achieving orbit constraints (which may require repeat visits to a system). For coronagraph-restricted and NIR-only bandpasses, most of the limited retrievable information is already captured at S/N = 10, with little improvement at higher S/N. For broader spectral coverage, the quality and quantity of retrieved information improve with increasing S/N, but combining visible and NIR ranges provides the most comprehensive characterization, even at moderate S/N. To maximize returns, wider spectral coverage should be prioritized over improving S/N when spectral access is limited.",

But despite their promising theoretical advantages, contemporary mode sorters often feature large crosstalk, high loss, or sort modes that are poorly adapted to conventional imaging systems (e.g., Hermite- and Laguerre-Gauss). Here, we introduce an alternative architecture that sorts spatial modes natural to circularly symmetric apertures: Zernike polynomials. Using conventional optics hardware and even-order vortex phase plates, we show how to assemble a series of vortex phase filters that can in principle separate the various Zernike polynomials losslessly and without crosstalk. This idea is demonstrated via application to wavefront sensing and coronagraphy, where we propose an optical system that saturates the quantum sensitivity limits to both tasks. We expect our work to prove useful for high-contrast imaging of extrasolar planets, improving both wavefront control and coronagraph performance.",

Submitted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics (A&A) Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) PLATO is designed to detect Earth-sized exoplanets around solar-type stars and to measure their radii with accuracy better than $2\\%$ via the transit method. Charge transfer inefficiency (CTI), a by-product of radiation damage to CCDs, can jeopardize this accuracy and therefore must be corrected. We assess and quantify the impact of CTI on transit-depth measurements and develop a correction strategy that restores CTI-biased depths within the accuracy budget. Using a calibration dataset generated with PLATOSim to simulate a realistic stellar field, we model the parallel overscan signal as a sum of exponential decays and use least-squares fitting to infer the number of trap species and initial estimates for the release times $\\tau_{r,k}$. Smearing is modeled with an exponential-plus-constant function and removed on a column-wise basis. We model the spatial variation in trap density with a quadratic polynomial in radial distance from the focal-plane center. The polynomial coefficients $a_{p,k}$, the well-fill power index $\\beta$, and the release times $\\tau_{r,k}$ are adjusted via iterative application of the Extended pixel Edge Response (EPER) method combined with a CTI correction algorithm, yielding the final calibration model. In the worst-case scenario (8-year mission, high-CTI zone), CTI induces a bias of about $4\\%$ in measured transit depth, reduced to a residual of $0.06\\%$ after correction - well within PLATO's accuracy requirements. From the calibrated parameters, we derive a correction scheme that brings photometric measurements within PLATO's noise budget, ensuring that the mission's precision requirements are met.",

IAC-25,C1,IP,18,x95380. 20 pages Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The TU Delft Astrodynamics Toolbox (Tudat) is a free open-source software suite for research and education in astrodynamics. Initially focused on numerical simulations of orbital dynamics and state estimation, it enables combining optical and radiometric tracking data from multiple sources to estimate the dynamics and parameters of natural and artificial bodies. Recent developments have added functionality for real tracking data analysis, with applications to planetary missions and Space Situational Awareness (SSA). Tudat currently supports processing of (i) deep-space Doppler and range data from DSN and ESTRACK, (ii) Doppler and VLBI data from the PRIDE experiment, and (iii) optical astrometry from the Minor Planet Center (MPC) and Natural Satellite Data Center (NSDC). Using tracking data from the MRO and GRAIL spacecraft and astrometric data of the asteroid Eros, we present prefit residuals (from SPICE-based observables) and postfit residuals (from fitting data to the Tudat dynamical model). Postfit Doppler residuals reach 1-5 mHz for MRO and GRAIL, orbit differences are a few meters for GRAIL and about one meter for MRO, and MRO range residuals are a few meters. From eight years of Eros astrometry, we obtain an orbit difference from the JPL Horizons solution by several tens of kilometers, consistent with its 3-sigma formal error. Tudat's SSA capability is demonstrated by propagating the orbit of Kosmos 482, a Venus lander launched in 1972 that remained in Earth orbit, over 50 years, including its predicted re-entry on May 10 2025. These examples showcase Tudat's modular, flexible, high-fidelity modeling across diverse orbital regimes within a fully open-source framework. All example code is publicly available, and future Tudat analyses will be published with fully reproducible code, allowing anyone in the community to improve and expand upon our work.",

The CYGNO Experiment aims to exploit an innovative approach applied to the direct detection search of low energy nuclear recoils possibly induced by cold particle-like dark matter candidates. CYGNO employs a directional detector based on a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) filled with a He:CF$_{4}$ gas mixture and equipped with an optical readout. Currently, the CYGNO Collaboration is constructing the detector demonstrator, CYGNO-04, in Hall F at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS). This 0.4 m$^3$ detector has the goal of proving the scalability of the technology and assessing the physics and radiopurity capabilities. Given the low radioactivity requirements, especially in internal components such as field cage and cathode, the reduction of material while keeping the correct electrical behavior is paramount. In this paper, we present the validation of several internal components, mainly focusing on the field cage material and support structure. The tests included geometrical asymmetries in the electric field response, collection efficiency as well as measurement of known physical quantities. A preferred configuration is found with a structure based on Nylon material which supports a PET or Kapton sheet with copper strips deposited on.",

The agile EOSs (AEOS), with stronger attitude maneuverability, greatly improve the observation capability, while increasing the complexity in scheduling. We address a multiple AEOSs scheduling with multiple observations for the first time}, where the objective function aims to maximize the entire observation profit over a fixed horizon. The profit attained by multiple observations for each target is nonlinear to the number of observations. We model the multiple AEOSs scheduling as a specific interval scheduling problem with each satellite orbit respected as machine. Then A column generation based framework is developed to solve this problem, in which we deal with the pricing problems with a label-setting algorithm. Extensive simulations are conducted on the basis of a China's AEOS constellation, and the results indicate the optimality gap is less than 3% on average, which validates the performance of the scheduling solution obtained by the proposed framework. We also compare the framework in the conventional EOS scheduling.",

The stratosphere at 30-40 km altitude closely resembles the surface of Mars in terms of pressure, temperature, and radiation levels (UV, proton, and Galactic cosmic rays). While microbial life in the troposphere is well documented, the true upper limit of Earth's biosphere remains unclear. The stratosphere offers a promising environment to explore microbial survival in such extreme conditions. Despite its significance to astrobiology, this region remains largely unexplored due to difficulties in access and avoiding contamination. To address this, we have developed SAMPLE (Stratospheric Altitude Microbiology Probe for Life Existence), a balloon-borne payload designed to collect dust samples from the stratosphere and return them in conditions suitable for lab analysis. The entire system is novel and designed in-house, with weight- and stress-optimized components. The main payload includes three pre-sterilized sampling trays and a controller that determines altitude and governs tray operation. One tray will remain closed during flight (airborne control) and another on the ground (cleanroom control) to monitor contamination. Additional systems include environmental sensors, GPS trackers, cameras, and a Flight Termination Unit (FTU) to end the mission once sampling is complete. A parachute ensures the safe recovery of the payload. Upon retrieving the payload, the sampling trays (including controls) will be sent to a suitable laboratory where the samples will be examined for the presence and nature of collected material.",

Medium-resolution IFS, such as MUSE at the VLT, are equipped to detect the emission lines of faint accreting companions when associated with dedicated stellar halo subtraction methods. We recently proposed a new approach based on polynomial modulations of a stellar spectrum estimate across the field of view, with orthogonal polynomials and lines masking. Aims. We seek to highlight and quantify analytically and on real data the benefits of this new approach over the one classically used, particularly with regard to distortions of the extracted spectra. Methods. We carried out analytical calculations based on simple toy models. Simulations of the most extreme situations identified were used to highlight these problems and corrections. Archival VLT/MUSE data of the young PDS70 and HTLup systems were used to vet the detection and characterization capabilities using on-sky observations. New images of the YSES1 planetary system were used to further illustrate the gains. Results. We show that the state-of-the-art method, based on low-pass filtering, can lead to the self-subtraction of the emission lines and modify the neighboring continua. We show that the proposed technique corrects these characterization problems, while maintaining the same detection capabilities. The two protoplanets PDS70 b and c were detected with 5sigma significance. The Halpha line estimate of the HTLup B stellar companion was improved by ~30% for the integrated flux and by ~8% for the 10%-width. As for YSES1 b, we found it uniquely displays a combination of Halpha, Hbeta, CaII H&K triplet, and HeI lines in emission. Conclusions. The proposed method better preserves the spectral information, notably the emission line fluxes and profiles, while achieving similar detection performance. Based on a linear and parametric approach, it can be extended and/or combined with additional faint signal search algorithms.",

Chemical composition of most potential Biosphere Substrates is in most cases very far from optimal for full-scale habitability thus productivity potential realization. To cover all surface of a Biosphere Substrate with a dense photosynthesising layer during most of remaining Planetary System lifecycle for achieving maximal carrying capacity thus workforce productivity enabling further expansion of biosphere to new substrates importing significant amounts of the limiting chemical elements by planetesimals redirection is ubiquitously inevitable. Although the price of such operations is high the value of maximal population productivity of Biosphere Substrates during the remaining Planetary Systems lifecycle is orders of magnitude higher. The farther planetesimal is orbiting from a star the more time but less energy is required for its delivery. The more distant from a star, the more rich in volatiles planetesimals are. The most technically detailed and feasible scheme to date of Planetesimals Redirection was proposed in 1993 by Dr. Zubrin based on NTRs. Nuclear fuel is extremely scarce and might be the principal limiting factor for final stages of interstellar colonization missions. We investigate possibilities of using concentrated beamed solar power Planetesimals Redirection operations for Terraforming as it can increase the possible scale of such operations to orders of magnitude. Such a mission might consist of Planetesimal Tug Spacecraft Systems (PTSS) to redirect a planetesimal, and solar Power Harvesting Beaming System (PHBS) tracking the spacecraft with a beam to power it. We found Solarpowered Planetesimals Redirection for Terraforming is feasible within Kuiper Belt with present technologies.",

The chemical make-up of a disk influences every aspect of planetary composition including their overall chemical properties, volatile content, atmospheric composition, and potential for habitability. This Review discusses our knowledge of the chemical and isotopic composition of Solar System materials and how this information can be used to place constraints on the formation pathways of terrestrial planets. We conclude that planetesimal formation by the streaming instability followed by rapid accretion of drifting pebbles within the protoplanetary disk lifetime reproduces most of the chemical and isotopic observables in Solar System. This finding has important implications for planetary habitability beyond the Solar System because in pebble accretion, volatiles important for life are accreted during the main growth phase of rocky planets as opposed to the late-stage. Finally, we explore how bulk chemical inventories and masses of planetary bodies control the composition of their primordial atmospheres and their potential to develop habitable conditions.",

      "abstract": "Impact of Subsurface Temperature Gradients on Emission Spectra of Airless Exoplanets: the Solid-state Greenhouse and Anti-Greenhouse Xintong Lyu, Daniel D.B. Koll Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) An emerging goal of exoplanet science is to constrain the surface composition of airless exoplanets. Without the protection of an atmosphere, these planets are likely covered by a powder-like regolith, similar to the Moon. Laboratory studies show that, under vacuum conditions, such regoliths can develop subsurface temperature gradients, also known as the solid-state greenhouse effect. This effect can significantly modify the emission features of airless bodies, but its potential impact on exoplanets is still unexplored. Here we derive analytic solutions of the two-stream radiative transfer equations with scattering, absorption, plus emission, and combine them with Mie theory calculations to model subsurface temperature gradients and emission spectra of airless exoplanets. The results show exo-regoliths can develop strong solid-state greenhouse or anti-greenhouse effects, with temperature gradients $>200$~K in the upper-most subsurface ($\\mathcal{O}(100)\\mu$m). These temperature gradients alter surface emission features, modify secondary eclipse depths by up to $\\sim50\\%$, and can produce higher-than-blackbody emission at some wavelengths. In addition, we study whether subsurface temperature gradients can be disentangled from other microscopic effects, such as changes in space weathering or particle size. At least in some cases, the co-existence of these effects makes it essentially impossible to distinguish different surface compositions within the precisions achievable by JWST. Overall, subsurface temperature gradients thus open potentially new ways to characterize surfaces of airless exoplanets, but they also complicate the interpretation of airless exoplanet spectra. In either case, their effect can be important and should be included in future modeling studies.",

These objects may hold key clues to the dynamical evolution of NEAs and the recent impact history of the Earth-Moon system. However, the population, distribution, and dynamical characteristics of these Lunar-Origin Asteroids (LOAs) remain poorly constrained. By combining the lunar ejecta production with N-body orbital simulations of the ejecta, we investigate their orbital evolution in the past millions of years and the current LOA population, revealing their significant potential for detection by future surveys. Specifically for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), we predict an average detection rate of about 6 LOAs (with D > 5 m) per year. Additionally, we find that the LOAs tend to approach from sunward and anti-sunward directions, with encounter velocities significantly lower than those of typical NEAs. These findings offer valuable insights in guiding targeted ground-based surveys and planetary defense efforts for LOAs in the future.",

Vidotto, Jorge Sanz-Forcada, Carolina Villarreal D'Angelo Accepted for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society Main Journal, 12 pages, 7 figures (including 1 in Appendix) Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The HeI 1083nm transit signature is commonly used in tracing escaping planetary atmospheres. However, it can be affected by stellar activity, complicating detections and interpretations of atmospheric escape. We model how stellar activity cycles affect the atmospheric escape and HeI 1083nm signatures of four types of highly irradiated exoplanets, at 0.025 and 0.05 au, during minimum and maximum cycle phases. We consider two stars, exhibiting different cycle behaviours: the Sun and the more active star iota Hor, for which we reconstruct its spectral energy distributions at minimum and maximum phases using X-ray observations and photospheric models. We show that over a modulated activity cycle, the release of extreme ultraviolet photons, responsible for atmospheric escape, varies substantially more than that of mid-UV photons, capable of photoionising HeI (23S). This leads to consistently stronger helium signatures during maximum phases. We show that planets at the largest orbit are more affected by cycles, showing larger variations in escape rates and absorptions between minimum and maximum. We also confirm the counter-intuitive behaviour that, despite the fall-off in escape rate with orbital distance, the HeI 1083nm absorption is not significantly weaker at further orbits, even strengthening with orbital distance for some iota Hor planets. We partially explain this behaviour with the lower mid-UV fluxes at more distant orbits, leading to less HeI (23S) photoionisations. Finally, we propose that stellar cycles could explain some of the conflicting HeI 1083nm observations of the same planet, with detections more likely during a phase of activity maximum.",

Such a convectively stable layer could have a strong influence on the internal fluid waves propagating underneath the core-mantle boundary (CMB) that are used to probe the outermost region of the core through the wave interaction with the geomagnetic field and the rotation of the mantle. Here, we numerically investigate the effect of a top stable layer on the outer core fluid waves by calculating the eigenmodes in a neutrally stratified sphere permeated by a magnetic field with and without a top stable layer. We use a numerical model, assuming a flow with an m-fold azimuthal symmetry, that allows for radial motions across the lower boundary of the stable layer and angular momentum exchanges across the CMB through viscous and electromagnetic coupling. On interannual time-scales, we find torsional Alfvén waves that are only marginally affected by weak to moderate stratification strength in the outer layer. At decadal time-scales similarly weak stable layers promote the appearance of waves that propagate primarily within the stable layer itself and resemble Magneto-Archimedes-Coriolis (MAC) waves, even though they interact with the adiabatic fluid core below. These waves can exert viscous and electromagnetic torques on the mantle that are several orders of magnitude larger than those in the neutrally stratified case.",

The atmosphere of KELT-20 b has been studied extensively via transmission spectroscopy at optical wavelengths, showing strong hydrogen absorption as well as metals including Na I, Ca II, Fe I, Fe II, Mg I, Si I and Cr II. The atmospheric and ionization conditions of this planet may differ from Jupiter-mass exoplanets due to the relatively weak extreme-ultraviolet radiation from its host star, as the stellar dynamo that generates chromospheric and coronal activity is thought to shut down at spectral types earlier than A4. We present the first spectroscopic observations of KELT-20 b in the far-ultraviolet using the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, searching for previously undetected low-ionization and neutral atoms in the upper atmosphere. We find that the FUV transit depth increases with decreasing wavelengths, from $1.88\\pm0.04$\\% at 1600--1760 Å to $2.28\\pm0.04$\\% at 1410--1570 Å, yielding planetary radii of $0.1139\\pm0.06$ $R_*$ and $0.1222\\pm0.07$ $R_*$, respectively.

      "abstract": "The mantle-inner core gravitational mode of oscillation in a strong magnetic field regime Mathieu Dumberry Journal of Studies of Earth's Deep Interior, Volume 1, paper 1, 2025 Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph) The mantle-inner core gravitational (MICG) mode is the free mode axial oscillation between the mantle and inner core sustained by the gravitational torque between their degree 2 order 2 density structures. Here, we investigate how the MICG mode is affected by oscillations of cylindrical surfaces in the fluid outer core in the form of Alfvén waves. The latter are triggered by oscillations of the tangent cylinder (TC) moving jointly with the inner core and propagate away from the rotation axis. We show that the MICG mode remains a distinct normal mode of oscillation of the core-mantle system only when the triggered Alfvén waves are attenuated before they traverse the width of the fluid core. For an internal magnetic field strength of a few mT, as we expect in Earth's core, Alfvén waves can readily traverse the width of the core, and the MICG mode is absorbed into the spectrum of torsional oscillation (TO) modes. The MICG period retains a dynamical influence, acting as a point of resonance for TO modes, and marking the transition from a TO mode in which the motion of the TC (including the inner core) is weakly impacted by gravitational coupling to one in which the oscillating motion of the TC is strongly restricted. Our results imply that the observed 6-year periodic signal in the length of day cannot be interpreted as the signature of the MICG mode and must instead be caused by TO modes, or more generally, by the propagation of Alfvén waves.",
