Here, we explore implications for symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity, a theory in which deviations from General Relativity (GR) arise through the non-metricity scalar $f(Q)$. Crucially, tensor modes propagate at the speed of light in this framework. However, their amplitude undergoes a modified damping during their evolution. We adopt a model-independent parameterization and derive an analytic approximation to the tensor mode transfer function to obtain the spectral energy density of primordial inflationary gravitational waves. Comparison with the NANOGrav 15-year and IPTA second data releases show that the inferred damping parameter $n$ remains consistent with GR, yet allows small deviations that could be observable. We then conduct a Fisher information matrix forecasts which demonstrate that the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) observatory will improve these constraints by several orders of magnitude, offering the potential to distinguish $f(Q)$ gravity from GR with high precision. These results highlight PTAs as powerful probes of non-metricity-based modifications to gravity.",

Kapadia Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Understanding how and when the first stars and galaxies formed remains one of the central challenges in modern cosmology. These structures emerged during the transition from the Dark Ages to the Cosmic Dawn, a period that remains observationally unconstrained despite strong theoretical progress. During this epoch, neutral hydrogen absorbed a fraction of cosmic microwave background photons through its 21-cm hyperfine transition, producing a 21-cm absorption signal whose evolution encodes the early Universe's thermal and ionization history. However, extracting the underlying astrophysical parameters from this signal is limited by severe parameter degeneracies, which cannot be resolved without independent observational probes. The next-generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as Cosmic Explorer (CE), will observe binary black hole (BBH) mergers up to very large redshifts and hence will detect a fraction of them formed within the redshift range $\\sim 13-25$. The merger rate of these BBHs will depend on the star formation rate density (SFRD) at these redshifts, together with the BBH formation efficiency and a time delay distribution. Therefore, the merger rate of these BBHs can work as a tracer of the SFRD in the redshift range $\\sim 13-25$. In this Letter, we establish a novel multi-messenger framework and present a proof-of-principle concept of how the observations of BBH mergers form next-generation GW detectors can improve the inference of parameters generating the 21-cm cosmic hydrogen signal, and help break degeneracies between them.",

In this work we investigate the self-resonance in deformed $\\alpha$-attractor T-model with a Gaussian feature near the minimum, distant from inflation's end. Linear analysis reveals altered resonance bands and deformed Floquet charts dependent on feature parameters. In fully nonlinear lattice simulations, we find that the gradient energy transfer is largely independent of the potential feature parameter $h$. In contrast, after resonance terminates, the subsequent evolution of gradient energy becomes strongly dependent on $h$. Statistical analysis reveals that models with the potential feature produce larger number of smaller oscillons, with a reduced energy stored in these objects, increasingly suppressed as the magnitude of $h$ grows. By tracking the total energy and the gradient energy contained in oscillons, we find that in models with nonzero $h$ oscillons are systematically shorter-lived, with this effect strengthening for larger $h$. The gravitational wave emission is dominated by the resonance stage and is strongly suppressed once oscillons form. Potential features leave the low-frequency spectrum largely unchanged but significantly modify the high-frequency tail. Although a complete reheating description requires external couplings and higher-resolution simulations, clear qualitative differences of cosmic expansion history already emerge within our simulated time window. These results highlight the important role of potential features in shaping reheating dynamics and their cosmological implications, and provide a deeper understanding of preheating dynamics and the properties of oscillons.",

This mechanism can provide a primordial black hole abundance which is larger than the standard one due to the gravitational collapse of sizeable overdensities in the radiation phase.

As the theoretical landscape expands beyond standard $\\Lambda$CDM, implementing new expansion histories into traditional Einstein--Boltzmann solvers becomes a significant computational bottleneck. Kosmulator addresses this by leveraging array-native execution and efficient ensemble slice sampling (via Zeus) to perform rapid Bayesian inference. We validate the framework against the industry-standard Cobaya code using a combination of Type Ia Supernovae, Cosmic Chronometers, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data. Our results demonstrate that Kosmulator reproduces Cobaya's posterior constraints to within $\\leq0.3\\sigma$ statistical agreement on $H_{0}$ and $\\Omega_{m}$ and $<0.6\\%$ precision on $\\chi^{2}$, while achieving a $\\sim 4.5\\times$ reduction in wall-clock time on a single CPU core compared to a standard MPI-parallelised baseline. Furthermore, we showcase the framework's utility by constraining the implicit power-law $f(Q)$ \"$f_1$CDM\" model and demonstrating its automated model selection capabilities (AIC/BIC). Kosmulator is introduced as a \"scientific sieve\" for rapid hypothesis testing, allowing researchers to efficiently filter theoretical candidates before deploying high-precision resources.",

Modeling the reduced Hubble rate with a node-based Gaussian-process-kernel interpolant, we constrain the reconstruction using CC, Pantheon+ SNIa, BAO data from SDSS and DESI, transversal BAO data, and external $H_0$ priors (SH0ES and H0DN). Assuming GR at the background level, we map the reconstructed kinematics onto a dark-energy fluid and a scalar-field description, yielding the total potential and kinetic contributions that reproduce the inferred $H(z)$. To interpret the reconstruction, we consider both a minimal single-field model (canonical or phantom) and a two-field (quintom) system consisting of one canonical and one phantom scalar field (or families). Within the GR-based effective-fluid mapping, the inferred dark-energy density changes sign for all dataset combinations explored, transitioning from $\\rho_{\\rm DE}<0$ at higher redshift to $\\rho_{\\rm DE}>0$ toward the present, and defining a transition redshift $z_\\dagger$ by $\\rho_{\\rm DE}(z_\\dagger)=0$. A single canonical scalar cannot realize such a smooth evolution during expansion, whereas a phantom field or a two-field quintom framework can accommodate the required behavior; in particular, the two-field system permits smooth phantom-divide crossings at finite $\\rho_{\\rm DE}>0$ and distinguishes them from the separate notion of a density zero crossing. The reconstructed kinematics admit intermediate-redshift structure in some combinations, including hints of an additional accelerated-expansion interval around $z\\sim 1.7$--$2.3$. The present-day equation of state remains close to a cosmological constant: combinations including supernovae give $w_0\\simeq -1$, while combinations without supernovae but with an external $H_0$ prior show only a mild preference for $w_0<-1$ at the $\\sim1.5$--$1.7\\sigma$ level.",

Moreover, it has been proposed that the ``memory burden'' effect can slow down the mass loss rate of black holes, allowing light PBHs to survive until the present day.

The BBH spacetime is characterized by the mass ratio ($q$) and the separation distance ($z_2$) between the two black holes. We numerically solve the radial momentum and energy equations to obtain the accretion solutions. It is observed that the CPD can exhibit shock solutions, which exist for a wide range parameter space spanned by flow specific angular momentum ($\\lambda$) and energy ($E$). We find that the shock parameter space is modified by $q$ and $z_2$. Investigations show that $q$ and $z_2$ also affect various shock properties, such as density compression and temperature compression across the shock fronts. Moreover, we calculate the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the CPD and examine how the SEDs are modified by $q$ and $z_2$ for both shock-free and shock-induced accretion solutions. SED is found to be nearly independent of the binary parameters. We essentially show that although $q$ and $z_2$ alter the effective horizon area of the primary black hole located at the center of the CPD, they have a minimal impact on the dynamical and spectral properties of the accretion flow around the primary black hole.",

However, previous studies have analyzed individual models, leaving the generality of this phenomenon unclear. To perform a model-independent analysis, we construct an effective field theory (EFT) of chiral GWs by extending the EFT of inflation and incorporating gauge fields. The resulting action unifies inflationary models with a $SU(2)$ gauge field, such as chromo-natural inflation and gauge-flation, and ones with a triplet of $U(1)$ gauge fields, systematically encompassing all possible GW production mechanisms consistent with the symmetry breaking induced by the gauge field background. We find that chiral GWs are generically and inevitably produced, provided that the effective energy density of the background gauge field is positive and the gauge kinetic function is not fine-tuned to a specific time dependence. This EFT offers a useful foundation for future phenomenological studies as well as for deepening our theoretical understanding of chiral GWs.",

Dense stellar environments such as globular clusters provide a natural channel for producing such systems through hierarchical mergers, where black hole remnants formed in earlier mergers are retained in the cluster and undergo successive mergers. However, gravitational-wave recoil kicks often eject merger remnants from typical globular clusters, which limits hierarchical growth. Massive clusters with deeper potential wells, such as those found in giant elliptical galaxies like M87, may overcome this barrier, but direct simulations of such massive globular clusters remains computationally challenging. In this study, we present a 10-million-body cluster simulation performed with the $\\texttt{Cluster Monte Carlo}$ ($\\texttt{CMC}$) code, referred to as $\\texttt{colossus}$, which serves as a proxy for the most massive low-metallicity globular clusters observed in the local Universe. This simulation demonstrates that extended chains of hierarchical mergers can occur in massive globular clusters, producing black holes up to fifth generation with masses approaching $250\\,M_\\odot$, comparable to the most massive LVK events observed to date (e.g., GW231123). Combining the $\\texttt{colossus}$ simulation with the previous $\\texttt{CMC Cluster Catalog}$, we develop a framework to extrapolate binary black hole merger predictions for the thousands of globular clusters seen in the Virgo Supercluster.",

Accepted for publication in JCAP Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The turnover at the peak of the Fourier matter power spectrum encodes a fundamental signature of matter-radiation equality in the early Universe. This delivers a potential standard ruler, independent of baryon acoustic oscillations and therefore able to break parameter degeneracies and improve precision. Furthermore, the turnover scale is independent of redshift and clustering bias, allowing for stacking of the signals from redshift bins. In practice, the very large scale of the turnover means that sample variance and systematics are serious impediments to its detection. Detections of the turnover and measurements of its scale have been made in the WiggleZ, eBOSS, Quaia, and DESI surveys. Upcoming surveys should improve the detection significance and reduce errors on the turnover scale. We use MCMC forecasts for turnover detection in a spectroscopic Euclid-like survey and a futuristic MegaMapper-like survey. In addition to the power spectrum, we include the signal from the bispectrum in equilateral configurations. These surveys are forecast to detect the turnover at $\\sim\\! 6\\sigma$ (Euclid-like) and $\\sim\\! 15\\sigma$ (MegaMapper-like), with precision on the turnover scale of $\\sim\\! 4\\%$ and $\\sim\\! 2\\%$.

Here we propose instead the possibility of holographic dark matter. In this case, dark matter does not arise in the framework of particle physics but is derived from the infrared cutoff set by the horizon scale. Using the Ricci cutoff, and a universe containing only baryons and radiation, we can account for the dark matter and naturally explain the coincidence between baryonic and nonbaryonic contributions to the density. In the presence of a pre-existing vacuum energy density our model reverses the sign of this density, thus accounting for the fact that certain string theories generically predict a negative vacuum energy, but observations require a positive value.",

      "abstract": "Hidden pattern of self-invariant cosmic expansion: Empirical evidence from Hubble diagram of supernovae Hoang Ky Nguyen Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We present empirical evidence extracted directly from the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa demonstrating that the speed of light varies as the universe expands. Moreover, the speed of light must vary in a specific quantifiable manner. To show this, we reformulate the kinematics of late-time acceleration using Dolgov's power-law cosmology $a=(t/t_0)^\\mu$ [Phys. Rev. D 55, 5881 (1997)] and Barrow's varying speed of light $c=c_0a^{-\\zeta}$ [Phys. Rev. D 59, 043515 (1999)]. In this cosmology, light traveling through an expanding universe undergoes an additional refraction caused by the varying c along its path, resulting in a modified Lemaitre redshift formula $1+z=a^{-(1+\\zeta)}$. The new model achieves a high-quality fit to the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa and exhibits a strong degeneracy along the locus $(1+\\zeta)\\,\\mu=1$. This empirical relation indicates a self-invariant cosmic evolution: at all instants during the late-time epoch, the speed of light is exactly proportional to the rate of cosmic expansion, viz. $c=\\mu^{-1}c_0t_0\\,da/dt$, a characteristic that is absent in the $\\Lambda$CDM model. This synchronous behavior between $c$ and $da/dt$ carries profound cosmological implications that we will discuss, regarding (i) the nature of late-time acceleration; (ii) a resolution to the horizon problem; (iii) Kolb's coasting universe model [Astrophys. J. 344, 543 (1989)]; (iv) a generalized cosmological principle into the time domain; and (v) a novel conformally flat metric applicable to cosmology. This newfound kinematic $c\\propto da/dt$ relation represents a stringent requirement that any viable dynamical model of cosmology must satisfy, a requirement that the $\\Lambda$CDM model does not fulfill. Thus, our paper delivers the clearest and most decisive evidence to date that challenges the standard $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm of cosmology and calls for variable-$c$ modifications to General Relativity.",

Gaia DR3 provides precise measurements of the four sky-plane components of the 3D relative displacement and velocity ($\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{v}$) for a wide binary, but not comparably precise line-of-sight (radial) separation and relative velocity $v_{r}$. Based on our new observations and the public databases/publications, we assemble a sample of 36 nearby (distance $<150$pc) wide binaries in the low-acceleration regime with accurate values of $v_{r}$ (uncertainty $< 100$ m s$^{-1}$). Kinematic contaminants such as undetected stellar companions are well under control using various observational diagnostics such as Gaia's ruwe parameter, the color-magnitude diagram, multi-epoch observations of radial velocities, Speckle interferometric follow-up observations, and requiring Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion consistency. For the parameter $\\Gamma \\equiv \\log_{10}\\sqrt{\\gamma}$ with $\\gamma \\equiv G/G_{\\rm N}$ (where $G$ is a parameter generalizing Newton's constant $G_{\\rm N}$ in elliptical orbits), we find $\\Gamma=0.102_{-0.021}^{+0.023}$, inconsistent with standard gravity at $4.9\\sigma$, giving a gravity boost factor of $\\gamma=1.600_{-0.141}^{+0.171}$. Four wide binaries have 3D relative velocities exceeding their estimated Newtonian escape velocities with $1<v_{\\rm obs}/v_{\\rm escN}\\le1.2$. These systems are unlikely to be chance associations and are expected in a nonstandard paradigm such as Milgromian dynamics (MOND). The hypothesis that Newtonian gravity can be extrapolated to the low-acceleration limit is falsified by this independent study with accurate 3D velocities. Future radial velocity monitoring and Speckle interferometric imaging for larger samples will be useful to refine the present result.",

Submitted to A&A Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present the splashback radius analysis of the Adaptive Matched Identifier of Clustered Objects (AMICO) galaxy cluster sample in the fourth data release of the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS). The sample contains 9049 rich galaxy clusters within $z\\in[0.1,0.8]$, with shear measurements available for 8730 of them. We measure and model the stacked reduced shear, $g_{\\rm t}$, and the cluster-galaxy correlation function, $w_{\\rm cg}$, in bins of observed intrinsic richness, $\\lambda^*$, and redshift, $z$. Building on the methods employed in recent cosmological analyses, we model the average splashback radius, $r_{\\rm sp}$, of the underlying dark matter halo distribution, accounting for the known systematic uncertainties affecting measurements and theoretical models. By modelling $g_{\\rm t}$ and $w_{\\rm cg}$ separately, in the cluster-centric radial range $R\\in[0.4,5]$ $h^{-1}$Mpc, we constrain $r_{\\rm sp}$, the mass accretion rate, $\\Gamma$, and the relation between $\\mathcal{R}_{\\rm sp}\\equiv r_{\\rm sp}/r_{200\\rm m}$ and the peak height, $\\nu_{200\\rm m}$, over the mass range $M_{200\\rm m}\\in[0.4,20]$ $10^{14}h^{-1}$M$_\\odot$. The two probes provide consistent results that also agree with $\\Lambda$-cold dark matter model predictions. Our $\\mathcal{R}_{\\rm sp}$ constraints are consistent with those from previous observations. For $g_{\\rm t}$ and $w_{\\rm cg}$, we achieve a precision of 14% and 10% per cluster stack, respectively. The higher precision of $w_{\\rm cg}$, enabled by its combination with weak-lensing constraints on the mass-richness relation, highlights the complementarity of lensing and clustering in measuring $r_{\\rm sp}$ and constraining the properties of the infalling material region.",

      "abstract": "A General Formulation of the Kinematic Dipole as a Functional of Selection and Source Properties: Beyond the Ellis--Baldwin Approximation Tsutomu T. Takeuchi (Nagoya University) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The dipole anisotropy in galaxy and QSO number counts induced by the motion of the observer (the kinematic dipole) provides an important test of cosmological isotropy and a comparison with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) dipole. Traditionally, the Ellis \\& Baldwin expression,$\\mathcal{A}=2+x(1+\\alpha)$, has been widely adopted, assuming power-law number counts and a single power-law spectral energy distribution (SED). Realistic surveys, however, involve a range of non-ideal effects, including diverse SEDs, finite instrumental bandpasses, non-power-law number counts, multi-band photometry and photo-$z$ selections, and direction-dependent or stochastic detection limits. In this paper, we incorporate these effects explicitly at the theoretical level and present a unified formulation of the kinematic dipole for a general parent population and a general multi-dimensional selection function. We show that the dipole amplitude is not described by a single index, but is instead given by a functional, $\\mathcal{A}[\\mathcal{W},f]$, defined as the Doppler response of the selection function acting on the underlying population. We demonstrate that the classical Ellis--Baldwin result is recovered as a special limiting case of this formalism, and clarify the relation between the theoretical coefficient $\\mathcal{A}$ and the dipole vector estimated from finite catalogs, separating theoretical response from statistical uncertainty. This framework provides a basis for reinterpreting reported discrepancies in kinematic dipole measurements across surveys and is directly applicable to future wide-area, multi-band observations.",

M. de Santi Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Standard cosmological analyses typically treat galaxy formation and cosmological parameter inference as decoupled problems, relying on population-level statistics such as clustering, lensing, or halo abundances. However, classical studies of baryon fractions in massive galaxy clusters have long suggested that gravitationally bound systems may retain cosmological information through their baryonic content. Building on this insight, we present the first analytic and physically interpretable cosmological tracer that links the matter density parameter, $\\Omega_m$, directly to intrinsic galaxy-scale observables, demonstrating that cosmological information can be extracted from individual galaxies. Using symbolic regression applied to state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations from the CAMELS project, we identify a compact functional form that robustly recovers $\\Omega_m$ across multiple simulation suites (IllustrisTNG, ASTRID, SIMBA, and Swift-EAGLE), requiring only modest recalibration of a small number of coefficients. The resulting expression admits a transparent physical interpretation in terms of baryonic retention and enrichment efficiency regulated by gravitational potential depth, providing a clear explanation for why $\\Omega_m$ is locally encoded in galaxy properties. Our work establishes a direct, interpretable bridge between small-scale galaxy physics and large-scale cosmology, opening a complementary pathway to cosmological inference that bypasses traditional clustering-based statistics and enables new synergies between galaxy formation theory and precision cosmology.",

Introducing such a localized feature temporarily decelerates the slow-roll inflaton, amplifying the primordial curvature power spectrum into a sharp peak. Consequently, this enhancement sources a significant stochastic background of gravitational waves and leads to abundant formation of primordial black holes. Through eight benchmark cases, we show that the predicted abundances of primordial black holes can remain compatible with current observational limits, while the corresponding gravitational wave spectra peaking across a wide range of frequencies are accessible to future gravitational wave experiments in multiple observational bands.",

      "abstract": "Complementary Roles of Distance and Growth Probes in Testing Time-Varying Dark Energy Seokcheon Lee Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Distance measurements have long provided the primary observational constraints on the expansion history of the Universe and the properties of dark energy. However, because such observables depend on cumulative line-of-sight integrals over the Hubble rate, their sensitivity to time-dependent features of the dark energy equation of state is intrinsically limited. In this work, we examine this limitation from an information-based perspective using the eigenvalue structure of the Fisher information matrix constructed from distance, expansion rate, and growth observables. We show that distance and expansion-rate data generically produce a strongly hierarchical Fisher spectrum dominated by a single information mode, reflecting an irreducible loss of sensitivity to temporal variations in dark energy. This behavior can be traced directly to the integrated kernel structure of geometric observables. Growth measurements, by contrast, respond through differential dynamics and can introduce additional independent information directions. Using both controlled mock data and survey-like configurations representative of next-generation experiments, we find that the impact of growth information depends not only on its nominal precision but also on the structure of the data covariance. In simplified mock setups, growth measurements can partially activate a second information direction even at moderate precision. In Euclid-like configurations, however, the information remains effectively one-dimensional until growth precision reaches the percent level, below which a second mode emerges rapidly. These results clarify the complementary roles of distance and growth probes and provide a model-independent criterion for assessing the physical content of cosmological constraints on dynamical dark energy.",

The inclusion of spatially resolved kinematic data helps break the mass--sheet degeneracy, a key limitation in strong lensing. Kinematics, however, suffers from its own degeneracy due to unknown stellar velocity anisotropy, which can bias galaxy mass profile inferences. We investigate the bias in $H_0$ using a sample of ten massive elliptical galaxies at $z=0.2$ from the Illustris $TNG100$ simulations. We generate mock line-of-sight velocity-dispersion maps resembling JWST NIRSpec observations and test four anisotropy models: Osipkov--Merritt (OM), Mamon--Lokas (ML), constant $\\beta$, and a generalized--OM (gOM) profile, under both kinematics-only and joint kinematics plus strong lensing analyses. We find a sub-percent average bias in $H_{0}$ across ten galaxies with joint modeling for three models: $+0.2 \\pm 1.6\\%$ (ML), $-0.9 \\pm 1.9\\%$ (constant) and $-0.9 \\pm 1.6\\%$ (gOM), with $\\sim 5\\%$ scatter. Joint modeling reduces bias, improves precision, and mitigates outlier results. Overall, the gOM model best recovers galaxy parameters and delivers the most accurate $H_{0}$ relative to posterior uncertainties considering both analyses. However, the single-parameter OM model produces large systematic biases: with kinematics only data, $H_{0}$ errors can exceed $20\\%$, and even with joint modeling, produces an overall bias of $+11.5 \\pm 1.3\\%$ (OM). The higher bias in OM is unlikely to average out across an ensemble of galaxies. Our findings highlight the impact of anisotropy assumptions on $H_{0}$ inference and, more broadly, in galaxy dynamics.",

Karen Yang, John ZuHone High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The viscous properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) remain poorly constrained. Cold fronts-sharp discontinuities formed during cluster mergers-offer a potential avenue to probe the effective viscosity of the ICM. Velocity shear across these fronts should generate Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHI), unless viscosity or magnetic tension suppresses them. We perform cluster merger simulations incorporating four ICM viscosity models: (A) inviscid, (B) isotropic Spitzer viscosity, (C) anisotropic Braginskii viscosity, and (D) Braginskii viscosity limited by microinstabilities. The isotropic Spitzer viscosity (case B) strongly suppresses KHI, producing smooth cold front surfaces, while the inviscid (A) and microinstability-limited (D) cases show prominent ripples. The Braginskii case (C) yields intermediate suppression. We also vary the plasma $\\beta$ parameter ($\\beta \\approx$ 100 and 1600) to examine how a changing magnetic field strength affects the results. Stronger magnetic fields further suppress KHI, leading to smoother fronts and reduced differences between different viscosity models, while also widening the range of permitted pressure anisotropies when microinstability-based limiters are present. These results indicate that both viscosity and magnetic fields play crucial roles in stabilising sloshing cold fronts in galaxy clusters.",

It implements stable numerical differentiation and derivative assembly utilities for Fisher-matrix forecasting and higher-order likelihood approximations in scientific applications, supporting scalar- and vector-valued models including black-box or tabulated functions where automatic differentiation is impractical or unavailable. These derivatives are used to construct Fisher forecasts, Fisher bias estimates, and non-Gaussian likelihood expansions based on the Derivative Approximation for Likelihoods (DALI). By extending derivative-based inference beyond the Gaussian approximation, DerivKit forms a practical bridge between fast Fisher forecasts and more computationally intensive sampling-based methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).",

We find a notable discrepancy between the optical and X-ray views: while optical data reveal a pronounced bimodal galaxy distribution with significant kinematic substructure signatures, the X-ray emission exhibits a single, smoothly extended component centered on the BCG. Our weak lensing analysis resolves this discrepancy by revealing that the mass is predominantly concentrated in the southeast ($\\log M_{200}/M_\\odot = 14.04_{-0.40}^{+0.24}$), while the northwestern substructure has a negligible mass ($\\sim 10^{13} M_\\odot$). This immense mass disparity rules out the dynamical possibility of a rotating system. We demonstrate that the apparent optical bimodality arises from the projection of a filament, which led optical group-finding algorithms to misclassify these galaxies as cluster members. This contamination creates a spurious substructure that mimics a rotation signal and leads to an overestimation of the luminosity-based halo mass, resolving the observed inconsistencies.",

Jonker, Kendall Ackley, Gregory Ashton, Nikhil Sarin 19 pages, 12 figures; Submitted to MNRAS; High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Identifying the host galaxy of a binary black hole (BBH) merger detected via gravitational waves (GWs) remains a challenge due to the absence of electromagnetic counterparts and the large localization volumes produced by current-generation detectors. A confident host association would provide stellar population properties to constrain BBH formation channels and enable measurements of cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant, H0. We simulate BBH mergers in nearby (z<0.25) host galaxies to evaluate the feasibility of host identification with future GW detector networks, including configurations with the planned LIGO-India detector and third-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE). We construct two injection grids to explore variations in BBH mass, distance, and directional sensitivity, and infer localization volumes using the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-based parameter estimation implemented through BILBY. To assess the prospects for unique host identification, we introduce a set of diagnostics: theoretical comoving volume thresholds for galaxies of a given stellar mass, derived from galaxy stellar mass functions, a metallicity-based volume threshold motivated by progenitor environment models, stellar mass fractions to quantify candidate host prominence, and the probability of chance alignment (p_c). These metrics provide ways to evaluate host associations and constrain BBH formation channels. We find that future networks that include ET and CE localize BBH mergers to volumes smaller than those theoretical thresholds, implying potentially unique host identification, out to ~1000 Mpc at a rate of ~100 yr^{-1}. While associations for individual events may remain uncertain, our framework is well-suited to population-level analyses, enabling constraints on BBH formation scenarios in the era of next-generation GW detector networks.",

Bayer, Francisco Villaescusa-Navarro Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) What happens when a black box (neural network) meets a black box (simulation of the Universe)? Recent work has shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can infer cosmological parameters from the matter density field in the presence of complex baryonic processes. A key question that arises is, which parts of the cosmic web is the neural network obtaining information from? We shed light on the matter by identifying the Fourier scales, density scales, and morphological features of the cosmic web that CNNs pay most attention to. We find that CNNs extract cosmological information from both high and low density regions: overdense regions provide the most information per pixel, while underdense regions -- particularly deep voids and their surroundings -- contribute significantly due to their large spatial extent and coherent spatial features. Remarkably, we demonstrate that there is negligible degradation in cosmological constraining power after aggressive cutting in both maximum Fourier scale and density. Furthermore, we find similar results when considering both hydrodynamic and gravity-only simulations, implying that neural networks can marginalize over baryonic effects with minimal loss in cosmological constraining power. Our findings point to practical strategies for optimal and robust field-level cosmological inference in the presence of uncertainly modeled astrophysics.",

By contrast, less than $0.2\\%$ of simulated CMB maps show a similarly significant temperature excess in nearby voids. Combined with earlier findings showing a $>5\\sigma$ cooling of CMB photons in galactic filaments in the same redshift range, we now have possible evidence for a negative Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect in the very recent Universe. In addition to having opposite sign, the observed amplitude is an order of magnitude larger than the predicted Rees-Sciama and ISW effects for the nearby Universe and similar to the expectation of some dark energy and modified gravity models predicting altered growth of gravitational potentials at very low redshift. We discuss the results in light of the latest Data Release 2 results of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) showing evidence for dynamical dark energy. Removing the quadrupole, we find the CMB temperatures measured in nearby voids to a large degree uncorrelated with the temperature measured around nearby galaxies and the observed mean difference between these temperatures is almost $6.5\\sigma$ larger than found in simulations.",

Weaver, H. Zou Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The Data Release 1 (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) is the largest sample to date for small-scale Ly$\\alpha$ forest cosmology, accessed through its one-dimensional power spectrum ($P_{\\mathrm{1D}}$). The Ly$\\alpha$ forest $P_{\\mathrm{1D}}$ is extracted from quasar spectra that are highly inhomogeneous (both in wavelength and between quasars) in noise properties due to intrinsic properties of the quasar, atmospheric and astrophysical contamination, and also sensitive to low-level details of the spectral extraction pipeline. We employ two estimators in DR1 analysis to measure $P_{\\mathrm{1D}}$: the optimal estimator and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) estimator. To ensure robustness of our DR1 measurements, we validate these two power spectrum and covariance matrix estimation methodologies against the challenging aspects of the data. First, using a set of 20 synthetic 1D realizations of DR1, we derive the masking bias corrections needed for the FFT estimator and the continuum fitting bias needed for both estimators. We demonstrate that both estimators, including their covariances, are unbiased with these corrections using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Second, we substantially extend our previous suite of CCD image simulations to include 675,000 quasars, allowing us to accurately quantify the pipeline's performance. This set of simulations reveals biases at the highest $k$ values, corresponding to a resolution error of a few percent. We base the resolution systematics error budget of DR1 $P_{\\mathrm{1D}}$ on these values, but do not derive corrections from them since the simulation fidelity is insufficient for precise corrections.",

A normal axion dark energy component in the mass range just below the Hubble scale can mimic a phantom component by appearing as dark energy at $z=1$ and dark matter at $z=0$, raising the possibility of a phantom mirage. We show that there is a wide range of axion dark energy contributions that can resolve the SN-BAO tension as well as thawing quintessence does, leaving BAO tension with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) for the distance measures from $z\\sim 1$ to recombination to be resolved at high redshifts.

While the standard smooth-$k$ approach successfully captures small-scale suppression effects, it intrinsically couples these to oscillatory features at intermediate scales. The VSMK filter generalizes this framework by allowing the effective logarithmic slope of the $k$-space window function to vary smoothly between two asymptotic regimes, thereby decoupling the small-scale suppression of halo abundances from the intermediate-scale oscillatory features characteristic of dark acoustic oscillations. We compare the analytic predictions obtained with the VSMK filter to $N$-body simulations for warm dark matter and ETHOS-based models, showing that a single parameter set reproduces both regimes simultaneously. The VSMK filter thus provides a unified and flexible analytic framework for modeling halo abundances in non-cold dark matter scenarios with damped and oscillatory power spectra.",

      "abstract": "Simulation-based cosmological inference from optically-selected galaxy clusters with $\\texttt{Capish}$ Constantin Payerne, Calum Murray, Hugo Simon 16 pages, 19 figures, 2 tables, submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics (abstract shortened for ArXiv) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Galaxy clusters are powerful probes of the growth of cosmic structure through measurements of their abundance as a function of mass and redshift. Extracting precise cosmological constraints from cluster surveys is challenging, as we must contend the complex relationship between richness and the underlying halo mass, selection function biases, super-sample covariance, and correlated measurement noise between mass proxies. As upcoming photometric surveys are expected to detect tens to hundreds of thousands of galaxy clusters, controlling these systematics becomes essential. In this paper, we present a forward-modelling approach using Simulation-Based Inference (SBI), which provides a natural framework for jointly modelling cluster abundance and lensing mass observables while capturing systematic uncertainties at higher fidelity than analytic likelihood methods - which rely on simplifying assumptions such as fixed covariances and Gaussianity - without requiring an explicit likelihood formulation. We introduce $\\texttt{Capish}$, a Python code for generating forward-modelled galaxy cluster catalogues using halo mass functions and incorporating observational effects. We perform SBI using neural density estimation with normalizing flows, trained on abundance and mean lensing mass measurements in observed redshift-richness bins. Our forward model accounts for realistic noise, redshift uncertainties, selection functions, and correlated scatter between lensing mass and observed richness. We find good agreement with likelihood-based analyses, with broader SBI posteriors reflecting the increased realism of the forward model. We also test $\\texttt{Capish}$ on cluster catalogues built from a large cosmological simulation, finding a good fit to cosmological parameters.",

We use a point-lens finite-source model for the microlensing light curve model and employ multi-stage selection procedures to identify microlensing candidates. From more than 25,000 variable candidates detected across all nights, we identify 12 microlensing candidates with light-curve timescales shorter than 5~hours, and among them, 4 secure candidates with high-significance detections. We estimate detection efficiencies using light-curve-level simulations that account for observational conditions and finite-source effects. Using a hierarchical Bayesian framework that combines the light-curve fitting information for each candidate with the Poisson statistics of the number of candidates, we derive constraints on parameters that characterize the abundance and mass scale of primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter. First, we derive upper limits on the PBH abundance under the null hypothesis that all events are assumed to be false detections. Next, employing the PBH hypothesis in which all (or only secure) candidates are assumed to be due to PBH microlensing, we derive the allowed region of the PBH parameters; the inferred mass scale is $M_{\\rm PBH}\\sim10^{-7}$--$10^{-6}M_\\odot$, and the PBH abundance to the total dark matter is $f_{\\rm PBH}\\sim 10^{-1}$. Our results demonstrate that HSC-M31 monitoring remains a uniquely powerful probe of PBHs, and highlight the need for further studies for example, using Rubin Observatory LSST observations of the Large Magellanic Cloud.",

The South Pole Telescope third-generation camera (SPT-3G) has observed over 10,000 square degrees of sky at 95, 150, and 220 GHz (3.3, 2.0, 1.4 mm, respectively) and will significantly overlap the ongoing 14,000 square-degree Euclid Wide Survey. The Euclid collaboration recently released Euclid Deep Field South (EDF-S) observations of 23 square degrees at wide field depths in the first quick data release (Q1). Aims. With the goal of releasing complementary millimeter-wave data and encouraging legacy science, we performed dedicated observations of a 57-square-degree field overlapping the EDF-S. Methods. The observing time totaled 20 days, and we reached noise depths of 4.3, 3.8, and 13.2 $\\mu$K-arcmin at 95, 150, and 220 GHz, respectively. Results. In this work we present the temperature maps and two catalogs constructed from these data. The emissive source catalog contains 601 objects (334 inside EDF-S) with 54% synchrotron-dominated sources and 46% thermal dust emission-dominated sources. The 5$\\sigma$ detection thresholds are 1.7, 2.0, and 6.5 mJy in the three bands. The cluster catalog contains 217 cluster candidates (121 inside EDF-S) with median mass $M_{500c}=2.12 \\times 10^{14} M_{\\odot}/h_{70}$ and median redshift $z$ = 0.70, corresponding to an order-of-magnitude improvement in cluster density over previous tSZ-selected catalogs in this region (3.81 clusters per square degree). Conclusions. The overlap between SPT and Euclid data will enable a range of multiwavelength studies of the aforementioned source populations. This work serves as the first step toward joint projects between SPT and Euclid and provides a rich dataset containing information on galaxies, clusters, and their environments.",

While these fields contributions may be disentangled based on the difference in their redshift evolution, thus far indications of non-negligible magnetic field have been found only at low redshifts. This work aims at extending the intergalactic magnetic field constraints to redshifts $z\\gtrsim 1$ using 17-year long all-sky observations of high-redshift active galactic nuclei with Fermi/LAT $\\gamma$-ray telescope. Combing the Fermi/LAT measurements in the 0.1 GeV - 1 TeV energy range with the Monte Carlo simulations of the $\\gamma$-ray \"echo\", it is shown that the zero field strength hypothesis at $z = [0.5; 3]$ is disfavoured at the $\\approx 8.6\\sigma$ significance level, yielding the lower limit of $B \\gtrsim 1\\times10^{-18}$ cG for the magnetic field correlation length above 1 Mpc. It is further shown that the same data put a lower limit on the volume-filling fraction of this field of $f\\gtrsim 90\\%$ in the redshift range considered. It is also demonstrated that the derived limits are not substantially affected by either source flux variability or the assumed $\\gamma$-ray emission attenuation model.

Rout, Diego Altamirano Accepted for publication in MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a systematic study of the evolution of the corona geometry in nine black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) using archival data from NICER. We identify 171 observations exhibiting quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) across various spectral states and model the time-averaged energy spectra of the source, as well as the energy-dependent rms and phase-lag spectra of the QPO, with the time-dependent Comptonization model vKompthdk. This allows us to simultaneously constrain the corona size and feedback fraction during outbursts. By using the power color hue diagnostics, we identify different spectral states, and observe that the QPO frequency increases from $\\sim$0.1 Hz to $\\sim$10 Hz in the low-hard and hard-intermediate states (LHS and HIMS), and remains approximately constant at 4--5~Hz in the soft-intermediate state (SIMS). The corona size shows significant evolution: the corona is large ($\\sim10^4$--$10^5$ km) in the LHS, contracts rapidly to $\\sim10^3$ km in the HIMS, and exhibits a flare-like expansion near the HIMS-to-SIMS transition. In the SIMS and high-soft state (HSS), the corona becomes compact and stable (4000--8000~km). The feedback fraction of the corona photons increases during the periods in which the corona contracts and decreases during the periods in which the corona expands, indicating a change of the disk-corona coupling. Our results are consistent with previous QPO-based studies using vKompthdk on some individual sources. This work, however, provides the first view of the coronal evolution across outbursts for a diverse BHXRB sample, offering critical insights into coronal behavior as a function of the spectral state of the source.",

Accepted for publication in MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Given that newborn magnetars are considered potential central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), there is strong motivation to identify gravitational wave (GW) signatures within GRB samples. If the X-ray afterglow of a GRB is powered by a magnetar, and the initial spindown of the magnetar is dominated by the GW radiation induced by $r$-mode instability or magnetic-field-induced deformation, the decay of the X-ray flux would record the information of the GW radiation. We find that GRB 130603B potentially represents a rare and precious case where the spindown of the central magnetar is dominated in-turn by $r$-mode and magnetic distortion-induced GW radiation. By fitting the X-ray light curve of GRB 130603B in this model, we obtain the initial spin period of magnetar $\\sim 5.3\\times 10^{-4}$ s, the effective dipole magnetic field strength $\\sim 5.2\\times 10^{14}$ G, the ellipticity of the magnetar $\\sim 1.3\\times 10^{-4}$, and the amplitude of $r$-mode oscillation $\\sim3.3\\times 10^{-2}$.

We describe in detail the code, which is written in Fortran and exploits parallel architectures using MPI directives both for the fields and particles. FPIC adopts spherical Kerr-Schild coordinates, which encode the overall spherical topology of the problem while remaining regular at the event horizon. The Maxwell equations are evolved using a finite-difference time-domain solver with a leapfrog scheme, while multiple particle ``pushers'' are implemented for the evolution of the particles. In addition to well-known algorithms, we introduce a novel hybrid method that dynamically switches between the most appropriate scheme based on the violation of the Hamiltonian energy. We first present results for neutral particles orbiting around black holes, both in the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, monitoring the evolution of the Hamiltonian error across different integration schemes. We apply our hybrid approach, showing that it is capable of achieving improved energy conservation at reduced computational cost. We apply FPIC to investigate the Wald solution, first in electrovacuum and subsequently in plasma-filled configurations. In the latter case, particles with negative energy at infinity are present inside the ergosphere, indicating that the Penrose process is active. Finally, we present the split-monopole solution in a plasma-filled environment and successfully reproduce the Blandford-Znajek luminosity, finding very good agreement with analytical predictions.",

Silagadze 29 pages, 3 figures, to be published in Physical Review D High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Dicke superradiance is a fascinating phenomenon in which a large number of atoms cooperate to produce a brief and very intense burst of spontaneous emission. This phenomenon has been well studied in the laboratory, but its astrophysical aspects have only recently attracted the attention of a small number of researchers. Since the phenomenon of Dicke superradiance is relatively little known to the wider astrophysical community, we provide a fairly detailed review of its elementary theory in the appendix and speculate on the significance of superradiance for astrophysical hydrogen and positronium, given the abundant formation of the latter near the galactic center.",

      "abstract": "Two-component $γ$-Ray Structure from the CR Sources Within Dense Clouds Lin Nie, Yi-Qing Guo, Si-Ming Liu High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Recent observations have revealed that several cosmic ray (CR) sources themselves exhibit pronounced double power-law features in their radiation spectra. Combined with the phenomenon of two-component structure in the observed CR energy spectrum supported by multi-messenger data, this raises a fundamental question: can the two-component structure of the cosmic ray energy spectrum and the double power-law feature of the gamma-ray radiation energy spectrum from supernova remnants be understood within a unified picture? In this study, we propose a two-component model that incorporates the re-acceleration of background ``sea\" CR particles by astrophysical sources to systematically explain the formation of double power-law spectra within those sources. Our model successfully reproduces the gamma-ray observations of multiple CR sources. The results support that double power-law structures may be a generic feature of Galactic CR sources within crushed clouds. This work offers a new theoretical perspective on the origin and propagation of cosmic rays, and its predictions may be further tested with future observations of a larger sample of CR sources.",

Except for Cygnus X-1, the maximum energies of gamma-ray photons emitted from these sources all exceed 100 TeV, strongly suggesting that microquasars are capable of accelerating cosmic-ray particles to energies above the PeV range. This work investigates the origin of the cosmic-ray knee region based on gamma-ray observational data from the aforementioned sources, combined with cosmic-ray proton, helium, and all-particle energy spectra, as well as anisotropy observations. Calculations indicate that these known sources contribute negligibly to the cosmic-ray knee region. However, further joint analysis reveals that a single microquasar located in a region approximately on the 2.6 kiloparsec scale in the anti-Galactic center direction can reasonably reproduce the observed cosmic-ray proton, helium, and all-particle energy spectra, as well as anisotropy features detected near Earth. We propose that this region may host one or several unidentified microquasars or similar systems, whose accelerated cosmic rays could dominate the observational characteristics of the knee region.",

Keane, Amanda Weltman High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The discovery of persistent radio sources (PRSs) associated with repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) has shed light on the immediate environments and possible progenitors of these FRBs. The confirmed PRSs may support the theory that FRB progenitors are compact central engines, whilst the non-detections suggest diversity of FRB's local environment. We perform a subarcsecond-resolution MeerKAT search at 1.28 GHz on 25 well-localised FRB positions provided by ASKAP and MeerTRAP. We detect 14 radio sources and provide flux upper limits for 12 non-detections (both these numbers include a source that was detected during two epochs of observation, and not detected during one epoch, adding up to 26). One radio source shows variability as seen in flux variations over three epochs of observation. Archival optical data reveal excesses in the direction of 13 detected radio sources. Similarly for four sources in the X-ray band, with one possibly being a high-energy signature of a radio galaxy core. Since we cannot definitively classify our detected radio sources as PRSs, future high-resolution observations with e-MERLIN will be required to resolve the radio emission and pronounce on the presence of compact PRSs associated with the 14 detected sources presented here.",

Willer 61 pages, 33 figures, accepted for publication in A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Magellanic Clouds, the closest star-forming galaxies to the Milky Way, offer an excellent environment to study high-mass X-ray binaries. While the Small Magellanic Cloud has been thoroughly investigated with over 120 systems identified, the Large Magellanic Cloud has lacked a complete survey due to its large angular size. Most prior studies targeted central or high-star-formation regions. The SRG/eROSITA all-sky surveys now enable a comprehensive coverage of the LMC, particularly due to its close vicinity to the south ecliptic pole. This work aims to improve our understanding of the HMXB population in the LMC by building a flux-limited catalogue. This allows us to compare sample properties with those of HMXB populations in other nearby galaxies. Using detections during the first eROSITA all-sky survey, we cross-matched X-ray positions with optical and infrared catalogues to identify candidate HMXBs. We assigned flags based on multi-wavelength follow-up observations and archival data, using properties of known LMC HMXBs. These flags defined confidence classes for our candidates. We detect sources down to X-ray luminosities of a few $10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, resulting in a catalogue of 53 objects, including 28 confirmed HMXBs and 21 new eROSITA detections. We identify several likely supergiant systems, including a candidate supergiant fast X-ray transient with phase-dependent flares. We find three Be stars with likely white dwarf companions. Two of the Be/WD candidates show steady luminosities across four eROSITA scans, unlike the post-nova states seen in the majority of previous Be/WD reports. Our catalogue is the first to cover the entire LMC since the ROSAT era, providing a basis for statistical population studies. Using the HMXB population, we estimate the LMC star-formation rate to be $(0.22^{+0.06}_{-0.07})$ M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, which is in agreement with other tracers.",

      "abstract": "A Minimal Interpretation of the Galactic Cosmic-Ray Spectrum from GeV to PeV Energies Felix Aharonian, Bing Theodore Zhang High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) High-precision measurements of the cosmic-ray (CR) proton spectrum have revealed significant deviations from a simple power-law behaviour. These deviations are characterised by three prominent features: (i) a progressive spectral hardening above approximately 200 GeV, (ii) an excess between 10 and 30 TeV (the ``multi-TeV bump''), followed by a sharp turnover around 100 TeV, and (iii) a pronounced structure between 0.1 and 10 PeV (the ``PeV bump''). We propose a minimal two cosmic-ray population framework that consistently accounts for the observed CR proton spectrum across six decades in energy, from GeV to PeV. In this scenario, the spectral complexity arises naturally from a transition between two Galactic CR proton populations in the 10-100 TeV energy range. The low-energy population exhibits a sharp cutoff at tens of TeV, while a second, higher-energy population emerges and dominates above 100 TeV, terminating with a smooth exponential cutoff at approximately 6.5 PeV. This framework reproduces all observed spectral features without invoking contributions from nearby sources or requiring non-standard assumptions about particle acceleration or propagation. Recent gamma-ray observations of supernova remnants, star-forming regions, and microquasars provide plausible astrophysical candidates for the origin of the two CR components.",

      "abstract": "Neutrino Emission from Gamma-ray Burst Jet Propagating inside the Cavity within Active Galactic Nucleus Accretion Disks Hao-Yu Yuan, Wen-Long Xu, Kai Wang, Wei-Hua Lei High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) from the merger of binary compact objects (BCOs) could occur in the accretion disks of the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Before merging, the BCO will inevitably form a low-density cavity. The sGRB jet will interact with the AGN disk photons during its propagation through the cavity, leading to unique electromagnetic and neutrino signatures. In this work, we investigate the influence of the AGN disk photon field on neutrino emission within the internal dissipation regions of a two-component sGRB jet (a narrow core and a wide wing). We find that, due to the strong AGN disk photon field, the neutrino flux at high-energy part (e.g., PeV to EeV) will be suppressed, while the relatively lower-energy part (e.g., TeV to PeV) will be enhanced. Such a conclusion can enhance the constraints on GRB parameters (e.g., baryonic loading factor and bulk Lorentz factor) based on the future detection or non-detection of high-energy neutrinos from GRBs. Besides, the two-component jet can display two-bump structure at higher and lower energy in the neutrino spectrum. Therefore, the joint observations of electromagnetic and neutrinos emission can help us identify the sGRB jet and its structure in the AGN disk.",

In particular, it is focused on the eclipse and out-of-eclipse spectra in order to compare the properties of the environment around the compact object. The high-resolution spectra obtained from the reflection grating spectrometer on board XMM-Newton was analysed focusing on studying eclipse and out-of-eclipse spectra separately. Several continuum models were explored in SPEX for which we studied the properties of emitting and absorbing matter depending on the emission and absorption lines identified in the spectra. It was found that the X-ray continuum is heavily absorbed by a neutral gas and photoionised matter. Emission lines from Si v, Mg xii, Mg xi, and Ne x were detected in the eclipse spectrum. In particular, H-like lines of Mg and Ne with a significance greater than 5 sigma in the eclipse spectrum and 3 sigma in the out-of-eclipse spectrum. But in the out-of-eclipse spectrum any absorption lines, if any, were detected with a significance less than 2 sigma. RGS light curve showed dips in the out-of-eclipse spectrum which are not due to an increase in the column absorption but may be produced by instabilities in the accretion stream. On the other hand, the level of counts above 20 was compatible with the X-ray background. A simple local continuum model was used to describe the He-like triplet of Ne and the derived values of R and G ratio parameters pointed out that the UV photospheric field should be important at the line production site and an electron density greater than 10(12) cm-3. As a consequence, a hybrid plasma may be present in the binary system.",

A key feature of this work is the explicit handling of the final-state leptons produced in ALP interactions with $^{16}$O nuclei and protons, which can generate Cherenkov light detectable in IceCube. These processes are being fully integrated into a detector-level simulation chain, enabling realistic detector signal modeling beyond existing estimates. The framework enables sensitivity forecasts for both direct detection and constraints based on time delays relative to the neutrino burst, across a range of ALP emission models.

Proceedings of the High Energy Phenomena in Relativistic Outflows IX (HEPRO-IX) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Based on very high-resolution resistive 2D and 3D magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of current sheets, our findings suggest that the answer to this question is likely no. In contrast, turbulence-mediated reconnection yields significantly faster reconnection rates - about an order of magnitude higher than the so-called universal rate for plasmoid-mediated reconnection in MHD flows ($V_\\text{rec}/V_A \\sim 0.01$). We conclude that turbulence-driven reconnection is the dominant mechanism responsible for fast reconnection and flares in systems such as accretion flows and relativistic jets in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). In these environments, turbulence is driven by instabilities such as the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), Parker-Rayleigh-Taylor instability (PRTI), and current-driven kink instability (CDKI). Finally, we present 3D General Relativistic MHD simulations of accretion flows that confirm the crucial role of turbulence-mediated reconnection in AGN systems. These findings have important implications for understanding the origin of flares, particle acceleration, and the production of polarized radiation in these extreme environments.",

Siemion 27 pages, 13 figures, published in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We report results of one of the most sensitive pulsar surveys to date targeting the innermost region of the Galactic Center (GC) using the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) at X-band (8--12GHz) using data from the Breakthrough Listen initiative. In total, we collected 9.5 hr of data covering the wider $\\sim 8'$ diameter of the GC bulge, and 11 hr on the inner $1.4'$ region between 2021 May and 2023 December. We conducted a comprehensive Fourier-domain periodicity search targeting both canonical pulsars (CPs) and millisecond pulsars (MSPs), using constant and linearly changing acceleration searches to improve sensitivity to compact binaries. Assuming weak scattering, our searches reached luminosity limits of $L_{\\rm min} \\approx 0.14~{\\rm mJy~kpc^{2}}$ for CPs and $L_{\\rm min} \\approx 0.26~{\\rm mJy~kpc^{2}}$ for MSPs -- sensitive enough to detect the most luminous pulsars expected in the GC. Among 5,282 signal candidates, we identify an interesting 8.19 ms MSP candidate (DM of 2775 pc cm$^{-3}$), persistent in time and frequency across a 1-hr scan at a flux density of $S_{\\rm min} \\approx 0.007~{\\rm mJy}$. We introduce a novel randomization test for evaluating candidate significance against noise fluctuations, including signal persistence via Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests and flux-vs-DM behavior. We are unable to make a definitive claim about the candidate due to a mixed degree of confidence from these tests and, more broadly, its non-detection in subsequent observations. This deepens the ongoing missing pulsar problem in the GC, reinforcing the idea that strong scattering and/or extreme orbital dynamics may obscure pulsar signals in this region.",

The comprehensive spectral analysis revealed that the system has a low interstellar neutral hydrogen column density of $0.34\\pm0.01 \\times$10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. The outburst began with a low mass-accretion rate and was characterized as a low-luminosity outburst. The radius of the inner accretion disc remained constant throughout the outburst. Additionally, a growing neutral medium with constant density was detected in the local environment of 4U 1755$-$this http URL hardness-intensity diagram (HID) did not follow the standard q-shaped pattern, indicating a non-canonical outburst. Instead, the HID showed a correlated evolution of hardness and source flux, suggesting a thermal disc origin of the flux. A wideband spectral analysis was performed using simultaneous NICER-NuSTAR data in two frameworks, based on kerrbb and bhspec. The results of bhspec (kerrbb) based modeling indicate that 4U 1755$-$338 is a high-inclination system, $67.44_{-3.03}^{+9.75}$ ($75.25_{-4.68}^{+5.59}$) degrees, and harbors a moderately spinning black hole with a spin parameter of $0.78_{-0.14}^{+0.02}$ ($0.50_{-0.43}^{+0.19}$) and a mass of $3.37_{-1.04}^{+0.45} (3.28_{-1.1}^{+1.7})M_{\\odot}$ respectively. The inferred key parameters: black hole mass, spin, and system inclination are consistent across both modeling approaches. No reflection features were detected in the spectra of 4U 1755$-$338. The high spectral index, the blackbody nature ($L\\propto T^4$) of the hardness ratio, the absence of reflection signatures, and the weak variability in the power density spectra indicate that the source remained in the high/soft state throughout the outburst.",

      "abstract": "Microquasar Remnants as Pevatrons Illuminating the Galactic Cosmic Ray Knee Bing Theodore Zhang, Shiqi Yu High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Microquasars are primary candidates for Galactic PeVatrons, yet their collective contribution to the cosmic ray (CR) ``knee\" remains poorly understood. We investigate this contribution by simulating anisotropic diffusive propagation through the Galactic magnetic field (GMF). Our results demonstrate that the GMF establishes a transport regime where magnetic connectivity between sources and the solar neighborhood determines the local flux. Active sources aligned with local GMF lines, such as Cygnus X-1, exhibit significant flux enhancements, while magnetically disconnected sources, such as V616 Mon, are strongly suppressed. By integrating source evolution with anisotropic transport, we show that the observed proton bump at the CR ``knee\" is best reproduced by the cumulative contribution of microquasar remnants, which is often dominated by a few nearby or recent events, rather than the active ones alone. We find that a harder injection spectrum allows CRs from remnants to reproduce the PeV bump after propagation, as low-energy CRs have sufficient time to accumulate while high-energy CRs escape the Galactic plane. Our findings suggest that the integrated history of microquasar remnants, governed by the interplay of source age and magnetic connectivity, is the primary driver populating the observed CR ``knee''.",

Burrows, Tianshu Wang, David Vartanyan Submitted to AAS Journal manuscript #: AAS73856; High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We explore, using a state-of-the-art simulation code in 3D and to late enough times to witness final observables, the dependence of core-collapse supernova explosions on the nuclear equation of state. Going beyond questions of explodability, we compare final explosion energies, nucleosynthetic yields, recoil kicks, and gravitational-wave and neutrino signatures using the SFHo and DD2 nuclear equations of state (EOS) for a 9-$M_{\\odot}$/solar-metallicity progenitor star. The DD2 EOS is stiffer and has a lower effective nucleon mass. The result is a more extended protoneutron star (PNS) and lower central densities. As a consequence, the mean neutrino energies, final explosion energy, and recoil kick speed are lower. Moreover, the evolution of PNS convection differs between the two EOS models in significant ways. This translates in part into interestingly altered neutrino ``light\" curves and noticeably altered gravitational-wave signal strengths and frequency characteristics that may be diagnostic. The faster exploding model (SFHo) yields slightly more neutron-rich ejecta and more species with atomic weights between 60 and 90 and a weak r-process. However, this is merely a preliminary study. The next step is a more comprehensive and multi-progenitor set of 3D supernova simulations for various EOSes to late times when the observables have asymptoted. Such a future investigation will have a direct bearing on the neutron star and black hole birth mass functions and the quest towards a fully quantitative theory of supernova observables.",

The aim of this study was to create a scintillation muon telescope module, continuously monitor the muon component in test mode, and study the long-term stability of the detector parameters. Methods for processing the obtained data were developed. To assess the stability of the module parameters, an internal control technique was used, involving data from other detectors. The results of testing and long-term continuous monitoring showed that the stability of the developed muon detector is better than 0.1%/year, without the need for its operation in a thermostatic chamber.

Rev. D 113, 043015 (2026) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Ultralight scalars emerge naturally in several motivated particle physics scenarios and are viable candidates for dark matter. While laboratory detection of such bosons is challenging, their existence in nature can be imprinted on measurable properties of astrophysical black holes (BHs). The phenomenon of superradiance can convert the BH spin kinetic energy into a bound cloud of scalars. In this letter, we propose a new technique for directly measuring the mass of a dark cloud around a spinning BH. We compare the measurement of the BH spin obtained with two independent electromagnetic techniques: continuum fitting and iron K$\\alpha$ spectroscopy. Since the former technique depends on a dynamical observation of the BH mass while the latter does not, a mismatch between the two measurements can be used to infer the presence of additional extended mass around the BH. We find that a precision of $\\sim 1\\%$ on the two spin measurements is required to exclude the null hypothesis of no dark mass around the BH at a 2$\\sigma$ confidence level for dark masses about a few percent of the BH mass, as motivated in some superradiance scenarios.",

Published version High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We propose that a hierarchical shock model$\\unicode{x2014}$including supernova remnant shocks, galactic wind termination shocks, and accretion shocks around cosmic filaments and galaxy clusters$\\unicode{x2014}$can naturally explain the cosmic ray spectrum from ~1 GeV up to ~200 EeV. While this framework applies to the entire cosmic ray spectrum, in this work, we focus on its implications for ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). We perform a hydrodynamic cosmological simulation to investigate the power processed at shocks around clusters and filaments. The downstream flux from nearby shocks around the local filament accounts for the softer, lower-energy extragalactic component around the ankle, and the upstream escaping flux from nearby clusters accounts for the transition to a hard spectral component at the highest energies. This interpretation is in agreement with UHECR observations. We suggest that a combination of early-Universe galactic outflows, cosmic ray streaming instabilities, and a small-scale turbulent dynamo can increase magnetic fields enough to attain the required rigidities. Our simulation suggests that the available volume-averaged power density of accretion shocks exceeds the required UHECR luminosity density by three orders of magnitude. We show that microgauss magnetic fields at these shocks could explain both the origin of UHECRs and potentially contribute to the diffuse radio synchrotron background below 10 GHz. The shock-accelerated electrons produce a hard radio background without overproducing diffuse inverse Compton emission. These results motivate further observational tests with upcoming facilities to help distinguish accretion shocks from other UHECR sources.",

Two competing ideas prevail: one attributes jet energy to accretion power of the black hole (BH), the other, more interestingly, to magnetic extraction of rotational energy from the BH. A decisive observational distinction between them is still elusive. We propose that BHs remnant from their natal GRB activity can serve as a critical testbed to discriminate between these two scenarios. Via analytical approaches, we demonstrate that extraction of rotational energy to power jets during the GRB phase drives the remnant BH to a universal equilibrium spin, independent of accretion history, initial spin, and mass. This model predicts a stellar-mass BH population with this universal spin, a hallmark of BH spin energy extraction. Testing against the 4th gravitational wave (GW) catalogue (GWTC-4.0), we find a statistically robust dominant population where secondary BH spins are narrowly centered at $\\sim0.05$. These findings provide strong new evidence for BH spin energy extraction.",

Comments welcome! The Astrophysical Journal, 998:171 (14pp), 2026 February 10 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Recently, the gravitational-wave (GW) event S241125n, detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK), has been reported to coincide with a candidate detected by Swift-BAT/GUANO and an X-ray candidate found by FXT onboard of Einstein Probe (EP) and confirmed by Swift-XRT. We estimate that the joint false alarm rate (FAR) for the three candidates is 1 / 30 yr and that the corresponding false alarm probability (FAP) is $\\mathrm{FAP}_{\\rm triple} = 0.037$ ($1.8 \\sigma$). The coincidence between the GW and GRB could be an interesting test of their origin and open attractive opportunities for multi-messenger observations, if they are actually associated. Motivated by this, we propose a theoretical model in which a binary black hole (BBH) merger occurs within an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk. The typically massive and significantly kicked merger remnant accretes disk material at hyper-Eddington rates, and the resulting jet could lead to the GRB associated with the GW event. As the jet interacts with the gas in the AGN disk, the shock breakout produces a Comptonized spectrum, consistent with an unusually soft photon index of the GRB prompt emission observed by Swift-BAT following LVK S241125n. Meanwhile, strong absorption and dust extinction of the afterglow by the high column density typical of AGN disks could explain the unusually hard spectrum observed in the X-ray band by EP, as well as the non-detection of an optical counterpart. Our model is predictive, and we highlight the importance of further constraining the orbital eccentricity of the merger and conducting deep-field observations of the host galaxy to test our explanation.",

We conduct a spectro-polarimetric analysis combining IXPE data with archival Chandra, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and Swift observations. We explore two limiting magnetic field configurations, parallel and perpendicular to the bulk flow, and simulate their expected polarization signatures using the 3DPol radiative transport code. To account for the rapid rotation of the polarization angle predicted by these models, we implement a phase-dependent Stokes alignment procedure that preserves the polarization degree while correcting for a phase-rotating PA. We also devise a new maximum-likelihood fitting strategy to determine the phase-dependence of the polarization angle by minimizing the polarization degree uncertainty. This technique hints that the binary may be rotating clockwise relative to the celestial north pole. We find no significant detection of polarization in the IXPE data, with PD<~50% at 99% confidence level. Our results excludes the high-polarization degree scenario predicted by the perpendicular field model during the brightest orbital phase bin. Simulations show that doubling the current exposure would make the parallel configuration detectable. The new PA rotation technique is also applicable to IXPE data of many sources whose intrinsic PA variation is a priori not known but is strictly periodic.",

Stenning 26 pages, 17 figures, submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Machine Learning (cs.LG) We present a deep learning approach to classify fast radio bursts (FRBs) based purely on morphology as encoded on recorded dynamic spectrum from CHIME/FRB Catalog 2. We implemented transfer learning with a pretrained ConvNext architecture, exploiting its powerful feature extraction ability. ConvNext was adapted to classify dedispersed dynamic spectra (which we treat as images) of the FRBs into one of the two sub-classes, i.e., repeater and non-repeater, based on their various temporal and spectral properties and relation between the sub-pulse structures. Additionally, we also used mathematical model representation of the total intensity data to interpret the deep learning model. Upon fine-tuning the pretrained ConvNext on the FRB spectrograms, we were able to achieve high classification metrics while substantially reducing training time and computing power as compared to training a deep learning model from scratch with random weights and biases without any feature extraction ability. Importantly, our results suggest that the morphological differences between CHIME repeating and non-repeating events persist in Catalog 2 and the deep learning model leveraged these differences for classification. The fine-tuned deep learning model can be used for inference, which enables us to predict whether an FRB's morphology resembles that of repeaters or non-repeaters. Such inferences may become increasingly significant when trained on larger data sets that will exist in the near future.",

MAXI J1744-294, or -- as it was known in its previous life -- Swift J174540.2-290037, was discovered in outburst by the MAXI telescope in January 2025. We present the results of a broadband, multi-wavelength study of MAXI J1744-294, including data from the NuSTAR, Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift, and NICER X-ray telescopes, as well as complementary radio and near-infrared observations. We analyze the changing X-ray emission as the outburst evolved from the high/soft to the low/hard state. Using relativistic reflection features in the data, we estimate a spin of $a>0.92$ and viewing inclination $\\theta=28^{+3}_{-4}$ deg, consistent with the parameters measured for Swift J174540.2-290037. Based on the spectral and temporal characteristics of MAXI J1744-294, we reaffirm its classification as a candidate black hole (BH) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) -- the third candidate BH transient discovered within 20 arcsec of the Galactic supermassive black hole Sgr~A*. This work provides further evidence for a cusp of BH-LMXBs in the central pc of our Galaxy, as argued for in previous observational studies and suggested by analytical and theoretical work. Our ongoing multi-wavelength study, involving a complementary range of observatories and spanning different outburst states, can serve as a model for future time domain astrophysics research.",

The question remains: can a strange star maintain such a high surface temperature for a long time?

Our results show that extremely high luminosity due to the Schwinger process and insufficient thermal conductivity of quarks leads to development of steep temperature gradient at the surface of strange star. As a result, the temperature at the surface and hence its luminosity decreases, reaching $10^{43}$ erg/s already at $10^2$ seconds. This result holds even in the presence of neutrinosphere.",

However, the smoking-gun observational evidence of the fireball is elusive. We envisage that the fireball emission should occasionally be eclipsed by the magnetar, especially when the burst duration is comparable to the magnetar's spin period. In this work, we first discover a peculiar type of burst whose light curve has a plateau-like feature among the long bursts of the magnetar SGR J1935+2154 detected by GECAM and Fermi/GBM. Then, based on these bursts, we identified four burst candidates with eclipse-like characteristics. By fitting their light curves with the eclipse fireball model, the viewing angle of the magnetar relative to its spin axis is estimated to be $17^\\circ \\pm 10^\\circ$, and the distances from the fireballs to the magnetar are found to be more than 5 times the magnetar's radius, indicating that the fireballs are suspended in the magnetosphere rather than adhering to the magnetar surface. Furthermore, we find this configuration is well consistent with the implication of the cyclotron resonance scattering feature we found in their spectra. Our results suggest that some intermediate X-ray bursts may originate from magnetic reconnection within the magnetosphere rather than the starquake.",

It consists of a swarm of 16U CubeSats carrying a state-of-the-art Compton polarimeter and a bismuth germanium oxide (BGO) spectrometer to perform timing, spectroscopic and polarimetric measurements of the prompt emission from GRBs. The mission is currently in a feasibility study phase (Phase A) with the European Space Agency to prepare an in-orbit demonstration. Here, we present the simulation work used to optimise the design and operational concept of the microsatellite constellation, as well as estimate the mission performance in terms of GRB detection rate and polarimetry. We used the MEGAlib software to simulate the response function of the gamma-ray instruments, together with a detailed model for the background particle and radiation fluxes in low-Earth orbit. We also developed a synthetic GRB population model to best estimate the detection rate. These simulations show that COMCUBE-S will detect about 2 GRBs per day, which is significantly higher than that of all past and current GRB missions. Furthermore, simulated performance for linear polarisation measurements shows that COMCUBE-S will be able to uniquely distinguish between competing models of the GRB prompt emission, thereby shedding new light on some of the most fundamental aspects of GRB physics.",

Zdziarski, Gulab C. Dewangan, Pragati Sahu 21 pages, 8 figures, Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal (ApJ) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a comprehensive broadband spectral and variability study of the newly detected black hole X-ray binary Swift~J1727.8--1613 in the intermediate states during its 2023 outburst, using multi-mission observations from NICER, NuSTAR, AstroSat, and Insight-HXMT. Spectral data up to 78 keV in the hard-intermediate state (HIMS) require models with two Comptonizing regions. In contrast, models with a single Comptonizing region adequately describe the soft-intermediate states (SIMS), implying a significant evolution in the disk-corona geometry between the states. The hard X-ray tail above $100$ keV in the HIMS, detected with both AstroSat/CZTI and Insight-HXMT/HE, indicates that the electron population in the corona is not purely thermal but rather hybrid, with a power-law distribution above the thermal cutoff. While both the reflection modeling and disk continuum fitting favor a truncated disk geometry in the HIMS, the disk in the SIMS moves substantially closer to the innermost stable circular orbit, accompanied by a significant rise in disk temperature. This interpretation is further supported by the increase in the QPO frequency from $\\sim1.3$ to $\\sim6.6$ Hz. From joint modeling of the disk continuum and reflection component and assuming the distance of 3.4 kpc, we estimate a black hole mass of $10.3^{+5.5}_{-2.5}~M_\\odot$, spin of $0.79^{+0.07}_{-0.15}$, and the disk inclination angle of $\\sim37\\degr$--$53\\degr$, which match well with the previously reported spectro-polarimetric measurements. We find a weakly variable or stable disk and a highly variable Comptonized component.",

Briel, Tassos Fragos, Monica Gallegos-Garcia, Anarya Ray, Michael Zevin, Abhishek Chattaraj, Jeff J. Andrews, Vicky Kalogera, Seth Gossage, Philipp M. Srivastava, Elizabeth Teng High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) In isolated binary evolution, binary black hole (BBH) mergers are generally formed through stable mass transfer (SMT) or common envelope evolution. In recent years, the SMT channel has received significant attention due to detailed binary models showing increased mass transfer stability compared to previous studies. In this work, we perform a full zero-age-main-sequence to compact object merger analysis using detailed binary models at eight metallicities between $10^{-4}Z_\\odot$ and $2Z_\\odot$ to self-consistently model the population properties of BBH mergers in the SMT channel, determined their progenitor initial conditional, and investigate the binary physics governing their formation and metallicity dependence. We use the population synthesis code POSYDON to determine the population of BBH mergers from SMT. Using its extended grids of MESA binary models, we determine the essential physics in the formation of BBH mergers. SMT produces BBH mergers predominantly from systems with $P_{ZAMS}\\leq10$ days. In these systems, both the initial mass transfer between two stars and the subsequent interaction between the remaining star and the first-born BH take place while the respective donor star is on the main-sequence (Case A). We find a limited contribution from wider Case B/C systems. Without a natal kick, the SMT channel does not produce BBH mergers above $Z>0.2Z_\\odot$ due to orbital widening from stellar wind mass loss. The primary BH mass distribution shows a strong dependence on metallicity, while the mass ratio prefers unity independent of metallicity due to mass ratio reversal. Additionally, the $\\chi_{eff}$ distributions contain peaks at $\\chi_{eff}=0$ and ~0.15 of which the former disappears at high metallicities. A mass-scaled natal kick leave this sub-population unchanged but introduce a low-mass, unequal mass ratio sub-population that merges due to their high eccentricity.",

Main points presented in Sections 1,2,5 and Figures 1,2,7&8 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We revisit the spectral appearance of extended self-gravitating accretion disks around supermassive black holes. Using dust-poor opacity tables, we show that all optically thick disk solutions possess a universal outer effective temperature of $T_{\\rm eff}\\sim 4000-4500$K, closely resembling compact, high-redshift sources known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Assuming the extended disk is primarily heated by stellar sources, this ``disk Hayashi limit\" fixes the dominant optical continuum temperature of the disk spectrum independent of accretion rate $\\dot{M}$, black hole mass $M_\\bullet$, and disk viscosity $\\alpha$, and removes the parameter-tuning required in previous disk interpretations of LRDs. We construct global self-gravitating accretion disk models with radially varying accretion rates, suggesting that burning of embedded stellar objects can both efficiently power the emission of the outer disk and hollow out the inner disk, strongly suppressing variable UV/X-ray associated with a standard quasar. The resulting disk emission is dominated by a luminous optical continuum while a separate, non-variable UV component arises from stellar populations on the nuclear to galaxy scale. We map the optimal region of parameter space for such systems and show that LRD-like appearances are guaranteed for $\\dot{M}/\\alpha \\gtrsim 0.1 M_\\odot /{\\rm yr}$, a threshold insensitive to $M_\\bullet$, below which the system may transition into classical non-self-gravitating AGN disks, potentially a later evolution stage. We expect this transition to be accompanied by the enhancement of metallicity and production of dust, giving rise to far infrared emission. This picture offers a physically motivated and quantitative framework connecting LRDs with AGNs and their associated nuclear stellar population.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) As wide-field optical surveys such as Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) begin operations, time-domain astronomy is facing a data revolution, paving the road for new, expanded variability studies. This work leverages the complementary power of optical variability and color selection to identify active galactic nuclei (AGN), focusing on optimizing the identification of obscured AGN, typically more challenging to distinguish from inactive galaxies based on optical variability alone. The analysis is designed to provide valuable insights in the context of performance preview for the LSST, albeit using a scaled-down version of the LSST dataset. We present the first combined AGN selection based on g+r+i band light curves from the VST-COSMOS survey, spanning 3.3 yr. We identify AGN candidates independently in each band using a random forest (RF) classifier trained on features mainly related to optical variability, along with six optical/infrared colors and a morphology indicator. We subsequently merge the three band-specific samples in order to enhance selection purity and reliability. We then focus on defining a subset of features that significantly improve the identification of obscured AGN. The RF classifiers yield a consistent performance across the three bands, highlighting the critical role of contamination. Using the combined three-band plus color selection we successfully recover $58^{+9}_{-8}\\%$ of all AGN and $69^{+10}_{-8}\\%$ of the known obscured AGN that have been independently confirmed in all three bands. When requiring confirmation in two out of the three bands, these fractions increase to $69^{+10}_{-8}\\%$ and $80^{+10}_{-9}\\%$, respectively. We also demonstrate that, while combining variability features with colors is crucial to improve obscured AGN selection, relying solely on color features returns a markedly higher contamination rate.",

Milone 12 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The presence of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters leads to a complex dynamical environment that significantly influences the evolution of binary stars, which in turn impacts the evolution of the cluster itself. For this study, we used a series of Monte Carlo simulations run with the MOCCA code to investigate the long-term dynamical evolution of binary stars in globular clusters hosting two distinct stellar populations. We explored how global binary properties such as incidence, fraction, and spatial distribution evolve over time due to the unique dynamical environment associated with each population. Our results show how binaries in the more centrally concentrated second population (P2) experience increased rates of hardening and disruption relative to the first population (P1), leading to distinct radial profiles in binary incidence and fraction. We also demonstrate the difference in spatial mixing timescales for binaries compared to single stars, where binary stars in each population retain some memory of their initial configurations even after complete single star mixing. Additionally, we investigated the formation and evolution of mixed binaries (binaries composed of a P1 component and a P2 component), which form primarily within the core through dynamical interactions. Finally, we studied main sequence--white dwarf binaries and find that they represent a larger fraction of binaries in P1 compared to P2. The results of this paper highlight the interplay between cluster dynamics and the evolution of binary stars and how binaries can act as tracers of the cluster's initial conditions and dynamical evolution.",

Whalen, Jenna Cann, Kimberly Weaver, Jeffrey McKaig, Sara Doan Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star formation feedback may heat and remove gas from galaxies in a process that quenches ongoing star formation and shapes the evolution of galaxies. Potential impacts from these processes can be seen in the complex and interconnected signatures of AGN and star formation activity throughout a galaxy. Here, we analyze archival integral field unit (IFU) data for the nearby Seyfert galaxy, NGC 1365, as observed with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Our analysis probes the ionization and kinematic properties of NGC 1365 at high spatial resolution over unprecedentedly large physical scales (approximately 40 kpc), allowing us to trace the effects of feedback throughout nearly an entire galaxy. We use these optical IFU data in conjunction with observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Chandra X-ray Observatory to analyze and compare maps of emission line flux, ionization state, star formation, and gas kinematics. In doing so, we identify a region of BPT-identified unexpectedly high ionization relative to surrounding areas in the star forming arms, and work to identify its source, finding that shock heating may play a significant role. Results from this analysis allow us to place constraints on the relative impact of AGN and star formation processes on the star forming gas in NGC 1365, as well as begin to inform our understanding on the global impacts of feedback in galaxy populations as a whole.",

HST WFC3 UV photometry in the 275 and 336 nm wideband filters is arranged in a Color-Magnitude Diagram (CMD), and overlaid on top of stellar evolutionary tracks from the MIST library. The star properties (mass, age, etc.) are computed with a Finite Element (FE) interpolation of the stellar tracks. The FE method, originally developed for solid mechanics problems, provides a general framework for interpolating fields inside domains of complex geometry. Besides the interpolated properties, the algorithm computes their gradients with respect to the photometry. These sensitivities provide a direct an efficient estimate of the associated uncertainties. Our catalog contains 655 stars, with the most massive one estimated at $58\\pm11~$M$_\\odot$. A comparison with a ground-based spectroscopic census of OB stars yields only 8 matches, evidencing the minimal overlap between both datasets. The mass estimates derived from the UV CMD and the spectral classification are in good agreement for the majority of O-type stars found in both datasets.

Inoue, Daniel Ceverino, Takashi Hosokawa, Daisuke Toyouchi 20 pages including appendices (14 pages main text), 8 figures, submitted to ApJ. Comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Understanding dust attenuation in galaxies at both integrated and spatially resolved scales is fundamental for accurately determining the physical properties of galaxies. Recent high-spatial-resolution observations with ALMA and JWST enable investigations of spatially resolved properties in high-redshift galaxies ($z \\gtrsim 6$), but spatial variations in dust properties remain poorly constrained. We use cosmological zoom-in simulations combined with post-processing dust radiative transfer calculations for 376 clumpy galaxies at $z=6$-$9$ with stellar masses of $M_* \\gtrsim 10^9 \\, M_\\odot$. For each system, we investigate dust attenuation and re-emission properties for three components: system-integrated, individual clumps, and diffuse regions. We find that system-integrated attenuation curves are grayer than the Calzetti curve, even when assuming MW- or SMC-type dust. Attenuation curves of individual clumps are even grayer, while diffuse regions exhibit steeper curves owing to enhanced scattering in optically thin environments. Since the effects of optical depth and dust-star geometry are intrinsically degenerate in attenuation curves, we introduce a toy model based on the IRX-$\\Delta\\beta$ plane, where $\\Delta\\beta$ denotes the difference between attenuated and intrinsic UV slopes. Applying this framework, we find that clumps have dust column densities approximately an order of magnitude higher than system-integrated values and exhibit co-spatial or dust-extended geometries. In contrast, system-integrated attenuation reflects star-extended geometries driven by contributions from optically thin diffuse regions. We apply this framework to REBELS-IFU galaxies at $z \\sim 7$ and find good agreement with our simulation predictions.",

Le, Yongquan Xue, Shifu Zhu, Mengqiu Huang, Hao Liu, Xiaozhi Lin 21 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Active galactic nucleus (AGN)-driven gas outflows are one of the best tracers of AGN feedback in action, as these powerful outflows expel/heat or compress the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM), thus quenching or enhancing star-forming activity in their hosts. Studying the kinematics of outflows in different gas phases is crucial for comprehending how AGNs impact the ISM within their host galaxies. However, the differences in the physical natures of ionized and warm molecular gas outflows remain largely unexplored. To obtain a complete picture of AGN outflows and their feedback effects, we present a study of both ionized and warm molecular gas outflows in six type-2 AGNs ($z<0.1$) that exhibit strong ionized outflows in previous optical observations. Utilizing the Triple Spectrograph and Double Spectrograph instruments on the Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope, we conduct spatially resolved measurements in the slit direction of strong emission lines from both ionized and warm molecular gas, such as $\\rm [O\\ III]$, $\\rm Pa\\alpha$, $\\rm H_{2}$ 1-0 S(1), etc., allowing for a direct comparison of their outflow properties. One out of six AGNs shows significant ionized and warm molecular outflows in near-infrared bands, exhibiting the most powerful kinematics and highest luminosity. A positive correlation between the kinematics and AGN luminosity is shown, suggesting that more luminous AGNs, which reflect higher levels of AGN activity, tend to have a greater impact on the gases, probably driving the outflows.",

The simulations produce starbursts lasting 20-30 Myr, with peak star formation rates of 2-68 M$_\\odot \\,\\rm{yr}^{-1}$.

Our total $\\eta_\\mathrm{M}$ values are higher than FIRE-2 by 0.06 dex but lower than EAGLE and TNG50 by 0.50 and 0.84 dex. Accounting for methodological differences in outflow measurement reduces these gaps to 0.2-0.4 dex, suggesting that part of the discrepancy between observations and simulations reported in the literature may arise from inconsistent definitions and measurement methods, though differences in individual phases persist. Larger observational and simulation samples, together with consistent methods for measuring outflow properties, are required to draw robust conclusions about the scaling relations of galactic outflows.",

Furthermore, delving into the properties of star formation (SF) in the LSB regime can broaden our understanding of SF activity in regions characterized by low surface gas density, thereby shedding light on fundamental cosmic processes. However, systematic uncertainties may hamper the exploration of the LSB universe by limiting detectable SB levels. Indeed, despite dedicated advancements in telescope and observing techniques over decades, achieving ultra-deep photometric depths in optical wavelengths remains a formidable challenge. To overcome this challenge and explore the LSB universe that we have yet to see, we have been developing a novel telescope called K-DRIFT. This paper outlines the telescope's specification and describes various LSB features we aim for, explicitly focusing on nearby individual galaxies. To further advance the capabilities of the K-DRIFT survey, focused on LSB detection, we present several feasible research topics that utilize other survey data together and discuss the role of LSB observation in understanding the evolution of galaxies.",

We outline a complete workflow for transforming raw CFHT exposures into science-ready data products, including calibrated single-epoch images, multi-band coadded mosaics, and extensive source catalogs.

Outflow signatures are detected in cold and warm/hot molecular gas, in H\\,\\textsc{i}, and in 36 fine-structure lines spanning ionisation potentials of 7.6--300~eV. Ionised outflow velocities range from 127 to 716~km\\,s$^{-1}$, with blueshifted and redshifted components consistent with a stratified biconical geometry. The cold molecular gas shows a mass outflow rate nearly 1--2 orders of magnitude larger than that of the warm/hot molecular and ionised phases.

Our results show that mass accretion via TDEs peaks within the first 2 Myr and decreases more rapidly for higher initial SMBH masses, with roughly half the disrupted stellar debris being accreted.

Henshaw, A. J. Rigby, R. Rani Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) estimates of the physical properties and star formation efficiency (SFE) of molecular gas in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), using new $^{12}$CO $J=2\\to1$ observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. Combined with CHIMPS2 $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO $J=3\\to2$, and SEDIGISM $^{13}$CO $J=2\\to1$ data, we estimate a median excitation temperature of $T_{\\rm ex} = 11$K for $^{13}$CO throughout the CMZ, with peaks exceeding $120$K in the Sgr B1/B2 complex. Cooler gas dominates around Sgr A and nearby clouds. We derive a median H$_{2}$ column-density of $N(\\mathrm{H}2) = 2 \\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a total $^{13}$CO-traced gas mass of $M_{\\rm gas} = 7 \\times 10^6$ M$_\\odot$, consistent with previous estimates when accounting for spatial coverage. The instantaneous SFE is assessed using Hi-GAL compact sources detected at 70-$\\mu m$ and 160--500-$\\mu m$. The 70-$\\mu m$-bright SFE, tracing current star formation, is modest overall but elevated in Sgr B1/B2, the Arches cluster, and Sgr C. In contrast, the 160--500-$\\mu m$ SFE, tracing cold pre-stellar gas, is more broadly enhanced, particularly in the dust ridge clouds and towards negative longitudes surrounding Sgr C. The contrasting distributions suggest an evolutionary gradient in SFE, consistent with a transition from dense, cold gas to embedded protostars. Our results imply that the CMZ may be enter a more active phase of star formation, with large reservoirs of gas primed for future activity.",

A first extensive comparison between real and synthetic data Jack Berat, Marc-Antoine Miville-Deschênes, Andrea Bracco, Patrick Hennebelle, Jeremy Scholtys 23 pages, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) LOFAR observations of diffuse interstellar polarization at meter wavelengths reveal intricate polarized intensity structures with an unexpected correlation with neutral HI filaments that could not be reproduced in simulations with low cold neutral medium (CNM) abundance. We investigate whether MHD simulations of thermally bi-stable neutral interstellar medium, with a range of CNM fraction, can reproduce the properties of the 3C196 field, the high Galactic latitude test field. Using 50 pc simulations with varying levels of turbulence and compressibility, we generated synthetic 21 cm and synchrotron observations, including instrumental noise and beam effects, for different line-of-sight orientations relative to the magnetic field. We developed MOOSE, a code to generate synthetic synchrotron polarization and Faraday tomography. We also developed a metric based on the HOG algorithm, to quantify the relative contribution of cold and warm neutral medium structures to the Faraday tomographic data. The synthetic observations show levels of polarization intensity and RM values comparable to the 3C196 field, indicating that thermal electrons associated with the neutral HI phase can account for a significant fraction of the synchrotron polarized emission at 100-200 MHz. The simulations consistently reveal a correlation between CNM and Faraday tomographic structures that depends on turbulence level, magnetic field orientation, and observational noise, but only weakly on CNM fraction. We found slightly weaker CNM-Synchrotron polarized emission correlation level than observed in the 3C196 field. These results suggest that low-frequency polarimetric observations provide a valuable probe of magnetic-field morphology in the multi-phase Solar-neighborhood ISM, while simultaneously underscoring the need for improved modeling of the turbulent, multi-phase, and partially ionized interstellar medium.",

With its fifteen year baseline and all-sky mid-IR coverage, NEOWISE provides an excellent avenue to discover thousands of slowly evolving infrared outbursts. With its all-sky spectro-photometric coverage and mid-IR sensitivity matching NEOWISE, SPHEREx is uniquely positioned to provide low-resolution IR spectra for the vast majority of these outbursts, several of which are too obscured for ground-based spectroscopic classification. As a demonstration of this approach, we present SPHEREx spectra for eight Galactic transients identified in NEOWISE. This sample includes two previously known FU Orionis-type (FUOr) outbursts whose SPHEREx spectra exhibit clear signatures of cool molecular absorption and three known classical novae showing strong emission lines in SPHEREx. Using these sources as templates, we identify two new FUOrs and one previously missed Galactic nova.

Specifically, fast rotators ($v \\sin i > 25$ km s$^{-1}$) exhibit stronger lithium depletion than slow rotators ($v \\sin i < 25$ km s$^{-1}$). This trend suggests that faster rotators develop stronger rotational shear at the convective-radiative boundary, which enhances turbulent mixing and accelerates lithium destruction.

Starting from a prestellar core without turbulence and with a misalignment between the initial magnetic field and rotation axis, the simulations are performed for $\\sim10^5$ yr after protostar formation. After disk formation, the magnetic field around the disk becomes significantly distorted due to the disk rotational motion. Consequently, the structure of the pseudodisk also evolves into a complex morphology. As a result, both accretion onto the disk and outflow become asymmetric and anisotropic. Accretion to the disk occurs primarily through narrow-channel flows or streams. The time evolution of the infalling envelope leads to non-steady accretion onto the disk, which in turn causes variability in the mass accretion onto the central protostar. This study demonstrates that complex infalling envelope structures and channelized accretion flows onto the disk naturally arise even without assuming turbulence or external asymmetric inflows.",

Our objective is to apply a mapping technique to estimate the age of a system and the initial chemical composition. We also evaluate the influence of observational uncertainties in mass and heavy-element mixtures on results. We applied an inverse calibration method to the evolution of a multiple stellar system, assuming that the stars share the same age and initial chemical composition. This approach determines age, the initial mass fractions of helium ($Y_{ini}$) and heavy elements ($Z_{ini}$), as well as the convective mixing-length parameters ($\\alpha_A $ and $\\alpha_B$). It uses the observed luminosities ($L_A$ and $L_B$), radii ($R_A$ and $R_B$), and surface chemical compositions ($Z/X_A$ and $Z/X_B$). We used the most recent observational data for $M$, $R$, $L$, and $[Fe/H]$ of $\\alpha$ Centauri A and B as input data for our method. We compared two assumptions for the $Z/X$ ratio, following the results for the solar composition. For an assumed high solar $Z/X_\\odot =0.0245$, we obtain an age of $7.8 \\pm 0.6$ Ga, $Y_{ini} = 0.284 \\pm 0.004$, and $Z_{ini} = 0.0335 \\pm 0.0015$. For a low solar $Z/X_\\odot = 0.0181$, the derived age is $8.7 \\pm 0.6$ Ga, $Y_{ini} = 0.267 \\pm 0.008$, and $Z_{ini} = 0.025 \\pm 0.002$. Observational errors in the stellar masses of $\\pm$0.002 lead to an age error of 0.6 Ga. Overshooting of $0.05-0.20H_p$ at the boundary of the convective core increases the age by $0.6-2.1$ Ga. Models with higher $Z/X$ and radiative cores, with ages of $7.2-7.8$ Ga, appear preferable and show better agreement with the observed asteroseismic frequencies.",

In this work, we report the discovery of a compact binary system consisting of two WDs in the centre of the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6397. The system, known in the literature as NF1, was observed as part of a MUSE radial-velocity survey aiming at characterizing the binary population in the centre of NGC 6397. The spectral analysis of NF1 provides an effective temperature of 16000 K and a surface gravity (log g) of 5.72 (cgs), which is consistent with an extremely low-mass He-core WD nature. This is further supported by the mass of 0.23 +/- 0.03 Msun obtained from fitting the star's spectral energy distribution using its HST magnitude in various filters. The system has a circular orbit with a period of 0.54 days. The radial velocities show a large semi-amplitude of 200 km/s, implying a minimum mass of 0.78 Msun for the invisible companion, which is likely another WD, or a neutron star if the inclination of the system is smaller than about 50 deg. Some significant residuals in radial velocity remain with our best orbital solution and we tested whether a model with a third body can explain these deviations. While this possibility seems promising, additional measurements are needed to confirm whether the star is actually part of a triple system.",

Comments welcome Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) PN K4-47 is a young planetary nebula that exhibits shock-excited bipolar lobes and a complex molecular environment, with the highest number of molecules detected within a planetary nebula. It has been questioned whether K4-47 is indeed a `typical' planetary nebula, or may be more exotic in nature. We examine this question using optical imaging and spectroscopy, and sub-millimetre and radio interferometry. Our observations spatially resolve the sub-millimetre environment of K4-47 for the first time. We find elongated CO (2-1) emission along a similar PA to the optical bipolar outflow. We derive a distance upper limit of 6 kpc to the source. The source hosts a fast ($\\sim$350 km s$^{-1}$) bipolar optical outflow, and a slow (~50-60 km s$^{-1}$) molecular outflow along a similar PA. The outflow velocity indicates an age of 336 $\\pm$ 119 yr. We also find that the excitation temperature and density of the atomic gas is~20 kK and 2800 cm$^{-3}$, respectively. The elemental and isotopic enrichment of K4-47 infers an AGB progenitor mass of 4-6 M$_{\\odot}$, which corresponds to a white dwarf mass of ~1 M$_{\\odot}$, following the initial-final mass relation for white dwarfs. We find that the core of K4-47 must contain 10$^{-2}$ M$_{\\odot}$ of dust to explain the extinction, and that photoionisation alone cannot explain the excitation of the atomic gas. We instead require an additional heating mechanism, with shocks a likely scenario. It is likely that the progenitor star of K4-47 was a J-type carbon AGB star, which formed the molecular and dusty circumstellar environment. The bipolar outflow is later triggered, punching through the circumstellar environment, producing shocks, and shaping the environment into the elongated structure seen in the sub-millimetre. We therefore classify K4-47 as a genuine, if unusual, planetary nebula.",

Ho, Weipeng Lin, Leyao Wei, Ran Li, Zuhui Fan, Yang Wang, Guoliang Li, Hu Zhan, Dezi Liu Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Bulge-disk (B-D) decomposition is an effective diagnostic to characterize the galaxy morphology and understand its evolution across time. So far, high-quality data have allowed detailed B-D decomposition to redshift below 0.5, with limited excursions over small volumes at higher redshifts. Next-generation large sky space surveys in optical, e.g. from the China Space Station Telescope (CSST), and near-infrared, e.g. from the space EUCLID mission, will produce a gigantic leap in these studies as they will provide deep, high-quality photometric images over more than 15000 deg2 of the sky, including billions of galaxies. Here, we extend the use of the Galaxy Light profile neural Network (GaLNet) to predict 2-Sérsic model parameters, specifically from CSST data. We simulate point-spread function (PSF) convolved galaxies, with realistic B-D parameter distributions, on CSST mock observations to train the new GaLNet and predict the structural parameters (e.g. magnitude, effective radius, Sersic index, axis ratio, etc.) of both bulge and disk components. We find that the GaLNet can achieve very good accuracy for most of the B-D parameters down to an $r$-band magnitude of 23.5 and redshift $\\sim$1. The best accuracy is obtained for magnitudes, implying accurate bulge-to-total (B/T) estimates. To further forecast the CSST performances, we also discuss the results of the 1-Sérsic GaLNet and show that CSST half-depth data will allow us to derive accurate 1-component models up to $r\\sim$24 and redshift z$\\sim$1.7.",

Using 3D driven turbulence simulations across a range of compressibilities, characterised by Mach number, and Minkowski functionals, we quantitatively investigate the morphology of magnetic fields generated by the small-scale turbulent dynamo in both the exponentially growing kinematic stage and the statistically steady saturated stage. In both stages and across all Mach numbers, we find that the magnetic field departs significantly from a Gaussian random field. Magnetic structures are statistically less curved and more interconnected in the saturated stage than in the kinematic stage, with these morphological differences decreasing as compressibility increases. Our work provides a quantitative description of how density fluctuations in turbulence and the back-reaction of amplified magnetic fields via the Lorentz force together shape complex, non-Gaussian magnetic structures, and offers a valuable framework for comparing simulations with both analytical models and polarisation observations.",

Combes Accepted for publication in A&A; 13 pages, 11 figures, 1 table Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Galaxy disks in rotation are sometimes the site of radial flows, especially in their gas component. It is important to estimate the outflows, due to AGN or supernovae feedback, or inflows due to bar gravity torques. However, these radial flows may be confused with non-circular motions, which are quite frequent in the center of galaxy disks. We use a simulated giant, barred spiral galaxy from the GalMer database to study the non-circular motions induced by the bar. Our goal is to identify the spurious radial flows that kinematics modeling algorithms can detect, assuming circular orbits for the gas. Using mock data of a strongly barred galaxy, we quantify the radial velocities computed by the 3D-Barolo algorithm for different disk inclinations and several bar orientations in the plane of the sky: along the major and minor kinematic axes and at 45° from them. Our results show that projection effects cause kinematics modeling algorithms to confuse the radial component of velocity due to elliptical orbits with significant radial flows with mean values up to 92 km.s$^{-1}$, within the bar region.

Zhou, Amelie Saintonge, Sami Dib, Pavel Kroupa Accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We construct a model by integrating observational constraints from the Milky Way and nearby galaxies to predict cloud-scale star formation rates (SFRs). In the model, we first estimate the initial total mass of clumps in a cloud based on the cloud mass, and then generate the initial clump population of the cloud using the initial clump mass function. Next, we model the star formation histories (SFHs) of the cloud to assign an age to each clump. We then sort out the intermediate-age clumps and calculate the total embedded cluster mass. Finally, we predict the SFR based on the duration of the embedded phase. The model-predicted SFR is broadly consistent with the observed SFR, supporting the plausibility of the model. The model primarily provides a theoretical framework that integrates a wide range of observational results, thereby clarifying the tasks for future observations.",

We find that radial alignment is substantially stronger than orbital alignment, with both signals being consistently stronger for subhalos than for satellites. Interestingly, inward- and outward-moving satellites/subhalos show contrasting orbital alignment behaviors, which can be understood in terms of their radial alignment, orbit decay due to dynamical friction and the effect of tidal stripping. The orbital alignment is stronger in more massive halos. In the end, we explore the orbital alignment measured by a mock observer, and find that the observed alignment for MW satellites is due to projection effects, as the major axes of satellites lie within their orbital planes, approximately coplanar with the observer.",

We introduce this survey by reporting the discovery of J1244-LyC1, a strong Lyman continuum (LyC) leaker at $z = 2.39$, exhibiting clear merger signatures. J1244-LyC1 has a highly significant ($10\\sigma$) LyC detection, corresponding to an absolute escape fraction of $f_{\\mathrm{esc}} \\! =\\!36\\%\\pm4\\%$ ($1\\sigma$). The LyC emission is spatially resolved into multiple peaks that coincide with the system's disturbed morphology, confirming genuine multi-site LyC leakage. With a stellar mass of $10^{10.2}{M_\\odot}$, J1244-LyC1 is both the first confirmed high-redshift LyC-leaking merger and the most massive LyC emitter known to date. We interpret J1244-LyC1 as a merger-driven starburst system in which tidal interactions have disrupted the interstellar medium, creating multiple low-column-density pathways that facilitate LyC escape. This discovery provides the first direct evidence of spatially resolved LyC escape in a merging system, offering new insight into the potential role of major mergers in driving the cosmic reionization.",

It has recently been shown that WLM is losing its gas due to ram pressure forces exerted by the surrounding intergalactic medium (IGM). In this work, we explore how ram pressure may also affect the WLM gas kinematics, and we show that its dynamics is especially perturbed at its outskirts, explaining the asymmetric rotation between the approaching and receding sides. Moreover, we have been able to decompose WLM in two main components, a compact one with a solid-body rotation that resembles a bar-like structure, and a more extended one with a characteristic double-horn profile suggesting an edge-on disk. The former is relatively unaffected by ram pressure while the latter has its dynamics considerably affected by ram pressure. This study shows that mass estimates of a dwarf galaxy like WLM should account for a full modeling of its dynamical components, especially accounting for its asymmetric rotation curve.",

Rasio 19 pages, 10 figures; Submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Dense stellar environments like nuclear star clusters (NSCs) can dynamically assemble gravitational wave (GW) sources. We consider a population of single stellar mass black holes (BHs) in the inner $0.1$~pc of a NSC surrounding a $4 \\times 10^6$~M$_\\odot$ supermassive black hole (SMBH). Using a semianalytic model, we account for direct collisions between BHs and stars and GW capture between BHs. We explore the effect of the initial BH mass and spin distributions on their final properties and the production of GW sources. Specifically, we consider upper and lower limits for the BH initial mass distribution, and we account for the possibility that a subset of our initial population are the merger products of primordial BH binaries. We find that $\\sim 500$ M$_{\\odot}$ intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) can form for our upper limit mass distribution, while our lower limit mass distribution forms none. Most IMBHs $\\gtrsim 200$~M$_\\odot$ eventually sink towards the center of the cluster and merge with the SMBH. We also find successive BH-star collisions can produce low-spinning BHs with $\\chi \\lesssim 0.2$. Our results have implications for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA sources. We find that the overall merger rate depends primarily on the initial BH mass distribution and is $\\gtrsim 10^{-9}$~yr$^{-1}$ per galaxy for our range of initial conditions. However, primordial binaries can change the number of second and higher generation mergers by an order of magnitude.",

A critical step in analyzing IFS data is the decomposition of emission lines, where different velocity components are often modeled with Gaussian profiles. However, conventional fitting methods that treat each spectrum independently often yield spatial discontinuities in the fitting results. Here, we present Emission Line Fitting Optimization (ELFO), a Python package for IFS spectral fitting. ELFO uses the results of neighboring spectra to determine multiple initial guesses and selects the result that exhibits spatial smoothness. We tested ELFO on IFS data of two quasars obtained from the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, where it successfully corrected anomalous fits, revealed previously unresolved substructures, and made large-scale kinematic structures more evident. With minor modifications, this method can also be easily adapted to other IFS data and different emission lines.",

      "abstract": "Free-floating Planets Produced by Planet-Planet Scatterings: Ejection Velocity and Survival Rate of Their Moons Xiumin Huang, Dong Lai Accepted for publication in ApJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The discovery of numerous free-floating planets (FFPs) has intensified interest in their origins and dynamical histories. A leading formation mechanism is planet-planet scatterings in unstable multi-planetary systems, which can naturally lead to planetary ejections. If these planets originally host moons, it remains an open question whether such satellites can remain gravitationally bound to FFPs after ejection. In this work, we investigate both the ejection velocity of FFPs produced by planet-planet scatterings and the survival rate of their potential moons; we estimate the latter by determining the statistics of the minimum planet-planet distance prior to planet ejection, and comparing it to the initial orbital radius of the moon relative to its host planet. Using the circular restricted three-body framework, we derive an analytical boundary for the ejection velocity based on Jacobi energy conservation, which agrees with the results of integrations. We also identify a minimum planetary mass required for successful ejection. For two-planet systems with finite planetary masses, we use simulations and analytical arguments to determine how the ejection velocity scales with the planetary mass and initial semi-major axis. We contrast our results to the ejection of planets around binaries in unstable orbits. Extending our analysis to three-planet systems yields similar results, reinforcing the robustness of our conclusions. These findings offer insights into the property of FFPs and inform future efforts to search for exomoons around them.",

Karkare, Izaak Morris, Gethin Robson Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det) Historically employed spectroscopic architectures used for large field of view mapping spectroscopy in millimetere and sub-millimetre astronomy suffer from significant drawbacks. On-chip filterbank spectrometers are a promising technology in this respect; however, they must overcome an orders-of-magnitude increase in detector counts, efficiency loss due to dielectric properties, and stringent fabrication tolerances that currently limit scaling to resolutions of order 1000 over a large array. We propose coupling a medium-resolution Fourier transform spectrometer to a low-resolution filterbank spectrometer focal plane, which serves as a post-dispersion element. In this arrangement, medium resolution imaging spectroscopy is provided by the Fourier transform spectrometer, while the low resolution filterbank spectrometer serves to decrease the photon noise inherent in typical broadband Fourier transform spectrometer measurements by over an order of magnitude. This is achieved while maintaining the excellent imaging advantages of both architectures. We present predicted mapping speeds for a filterbank-dispersed Fourier transform spectrometer from a ground-based site and a balloon-borne platform. We also demonstrate the potential that an instrument of this type has for an R~1000 line intensity mapping experiment using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as an example platform. We demonstrate that a filterbank-dispersed Fourier transform spectrometer would be capable of R~1000 measurements of CO power spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10--100 with surveys of $10^5$--$10^6$ spectrometer hours.",

Using $R=40-130$ spectrophotometry at $\\lambda=0.7-5$ $\\mu$m, light curves, spectra, and imaging of ATLAS were obtained. From these, robust detections of water gas emission at $2.7-2.8$ $\\mu$m and $CO_2$ gas at $4.23-4.27$ $\\mu$m plus tentative detections of $^{13}CO_2$ and $CO$ gas were found. A slightly extended $H_2O$ coma was detected, and a huge $CO_2$ atmosphere of extending out to at least $4.2 \\times 10^{5}$ km was discovered. Gas production rates and 1$\\sigma$ errors for $H_2O$, $^{12}CO_2$, $^{13}CO_2$, and $CO$ were $Q_{gas} = 3.2 \\times 10^{26} \\pm 20\\%$, $1.6 \\times 10^{27} \\pm 10\\%$, $1.3 \\times 10^{25} \\pm 25\\%$, and $1.0 \\times 10^{26} \\pm 25\\%$, respectively. Co-addition of all $\\lambda = 1.0-1.5$ $\\mu$m scattered light continuum images from produced a high SNR image consistent with an unresolved source. The scattered light lightcurve showed $\\lesssim 15\\%$ variability over the observation period. The absolute brightness of ATLAS at $1.0-1.5$ $\\mu$m is consistent with a $< 2.5$ km radius nucleus surrounded by a 100 times brighter coma. The $1.5-4.0$ $\\mu$m continuum structure shows a strong feature commensurate with water ice absorption seen in KBOs and distant comets. The observed cometary behavior of ATLAS, including its preponderance of $CO_2$ emission, lack of $CO$ output, small size, and predominance of large icy chunks of material in a flux-dominant coma is similar to the behavior of short period comet 103P/Hartley 2, the ''hyperactive comet'' flyby target of the NASA Deep Impact extended mission in 2010. This correspondence suggests that ISOs can be significantly thermally processed before ejection into the ISM, and by comparison to 1I and 2I, can be widely variable in their physical outcome.",

      "abstract": "Assessment of DKIST/VTF Capabilities for the Detection of Local Acoustic Source Wavefronts Corinne Morrell, Mark P. Rast, Shah Mohammad Bahauddin, Ivan Milić Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Recent studies have demonstrated that temporal filtering can successfully identify local-acoustic-source wavefronts in radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar photosphere. Extending this capability to observations promises new insight into the stochastic excitation of solar p-modes, the source depth distribution below the photosphere, and the dominant physical processes underlying acoustic wave excitation. Such measurements would also enable improved characterization of the complex wavefield in the lower chromosphere and open the possibility of ultra-local helioseismic diagnostics. In this work, we assess an observational strategy for the detection of local acoustic wavefronts on the Sun using the National Science Foundation's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope's Visible Tunable Filter (DKIST/VTF). Because wavefront identification requires high spatial and temporal resolution and is limited by the small amplitudes of the wave perturbations, we focus on identifying specific wavelength combinations within spectral lines that maximize the sensitivity to the wave signal at the atmospheric heights where that signal is highest while minimizing contamination by atmospheric variability at other heights. Under the cadence and spectral resolution constraints of DKIST/VTF observations and for the particular simulated wavefront we examine, this approach suggests two possible strategies for the detection of acoustic wavefronts in solar observations: fast monochromatic imaging at 6302.425 A, or ordered interleaved observations in the blue wing of either the Fe I 6302.5 A or Fe I 5250.6 A line (between 6302.419 A and 6302.465 A, or between 5250.579 A and 5250.607 A respectively).",

They appear in different sizes, having a wide distribution in their area. We analyse the sunspot group area of the past 13 cycles and the Bipolar Magnetic Region (BMR) flux for Cycles 23 and 24 to explore their area and flux distributions and connect with the theory. We find that, in general, the group area and BMR flux are statistically larger in the rising phase than in the declining phase of the solar cycle. This implies that the rising phase of the solar cycle is prone to drive more intense space weather. We further show that the mean and median of the area distribution during the rising phase are dependent on cycle strength. However, the distribution mean and median are cycle strength-independent or weakly dependent during the decline phases of the solar cycles, particularly during the last three years when the latitudinal bands of all cycles migrate towards the equator along the same trajectory. These results support the theoretical model of nonlinear flux loss due to flux emergence, which explains why solar cycles rise differently but decay similarly.",

Green, Gracyn Jewett, Manuel Barrientos, Alexander L. Albright, Warren R. Brown Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present a detailed model atmosphere analysis of hot white dwarfs in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1. Our sample includes 19,321 unique targets with $G_{\\rm BP}-G_{\\rm RP}\\leq0$. We use the DESI spectra along with Gaia parallaxes and SDSS, Pan-STARRS, and SkyMapper photometry to perform spectroscopic and photometric fits. We find a significant discrepancy between the photometric and spectroscopic masses for DA white dwarfs (a systematic offset of 0.05-$0.06~M_\\odot$), indicating problems with the broad hydrogen line profiles in DESI spectroscopy data. Our photometric fits are consistent with a peak at the canonical mass of $0.6~M_\\odot$. A remarkable feature of the mass distribution is the prevalence of magnetic white dwarfs among the ultramassive DA population and that of warm DQs in the non-DA distribution. We identify 70 DQs in the DESI hot white dwarf sample, including 9 DAQs with carbon and hydrogen atmospheres. We constrain the ratio of non-DA to DA white dwarfs as a function of temperature, and discuss the implications for the spectral evolution of white dwarfs in the temperature range $10^5-10^4$ K. We also discuss unusual objects in the sample, including metal-rich white dwarfs and extremely low mass white dwarfs. This analysis provides the first look at the large sample of Gaia-selected white dwarf candidates that will be observed with multiplexed spectroscopic surveys like DESI, SDSS-V, 4MOST, and WEAVE over the next several years.",

Evans, Sabyasachi Chattopadhyay Accepted for publication in MNRAS Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) SXP 31.0 is an X-ray source in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) that was first identified as a Be X-ray Binary (BeXRB) system when it went into X-ray outbusrst in 1998. It is now known to consist of an OBe main sequence star and a neutron star with a spin period of 31s. In 2025 a new X-ray outburst phase began with the source exhibiting a luminosities approaching the Eddington limit of 10^38 erg/s. Unusually, H-alpha images show it has a surrounding halo whose nature has not been clear. In this paper, we report new observations of this halo, including the first multi-fibre Integrated Flux Unit (IFU) observations, which identify this emission as probably a coincidental HII region. The X-ray, UV & optical data cover a period of ~200d and reveal that the source underwent two bright, back-to-back, Type II outbursts in 2025 - a rare occurrence for any BeXRB system.",

Singh Rathour, V. Hocdé Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Modern tools for modeling stellar evolution, such as MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics), offer state-of-the-art implementations of stellar theories. However, this parametric approach introduces many free parameters that are often not constrained by observations. This is particularly important for evolved stars, like classical Cepheids, because uncertainties increase with evolution time. In previous work, we studied the effect of varying microphysics, including solar abundance mixtures, nuclear networks, atmosphere models, mixing-length prescriptions, treatments of convective boundaries, and numerical setup on evolutionary tracks. Here, we extend this analysis to the surface abundances of the dominant elements H, He, C, N, O, Ne, and Mg. We establish a reference model and 22 variants for each mass and metallicity, evolving them from the Zero-Age Main Sequence to central helium exhaustion. Masses between 2 to 8 solar mass and metallicities Z=0.0014, 0.004, 0.014 are explored, spanning the range of classical Cepheids. Both canonical and overshooting models are computed and compared. We find that uncertainties in surface abundances are generally small, arising mainly from variations in the depth of the convective envelope during the first dredge-up. The size of the convective envelope is sensitive to many aspects, including mass and metallicity. The central C/O ratio, relevant for white dwarf evolution, can vary by about 0.15, driven largely by convective boundary treatments or by modifying the 12C(alpha,gamma)16O reaction rate during helium burning. Surface and central abundances for the considered models at several benchmark points during the evolution are provided online.",

We investigate the interplay between convection, rotation, and cloud thermal feedback using a selected sample of Y dwarf atmospheric models. We explore effective temperatures $400~\\mathrm{K} \\leq T_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\leq 600~\\mathrm{K}$ and rotation periods $P_{\\mathrm{rot}} = 2.5 \\text{--} 20\\ \\mathrm{h}$, where salt and sulfide condensates are expected. We include $\\mathrm{KCl,~Na_{2}S}$, and $\\mathrm{MnS}$ clouds to assess their atmospheric impact and identify circulation regimes across parameter space. We run twelve general circulation models (GCMs) spanning this grid and develop additional physics modules for the THOR GCM to model brown dwarf atmospheres. The dynamical core is coupled to interior thermal perturbations near the radiative-convective boundary, a mixing-length convection scheme, gray two-stream radiative transfer with Rosseland-mean opacities, and simple cloud tracers including thermal feedback and scattering. All simulations exhibit a radiative-forcing-dominated regime with weak winds, minimal horizontal temperature contrasts, and no persistent jets. Convection controls vertical mixing and sets the extent of salt and sulfide cloud layers below the photosphere. Thermal structures equilibrate quickly and cloud radiative feedback remains insignificant, with limited variability. Within the gray radiative transfer framework adopted here, Y dwarf atmospheres in this parameter space are controlled by interior thermal radiation. Rotation sets modest variability, while clouds play a secondary role. Because our single-band approach does not capture spectral windows that could probe deeper cloud layers, our constraints on cloud radiative feedback are likely conservative, and we outline pathways toward more active regimes.",

Solanki Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The solar chromosphere is a region where radiation plays a critical role in energy transfer and interacts strongly with the plasma. In this layer, strong spectral lines, such as the Lyman lines, contribute significantly to radiative energy exchange. Due to the long ionization/relaxation timescale, departures from LTE become significant in the chromosphere. Accurately modeling this layer therefore requires one to solve the non-LTE radiative transfer for the Lyman transitions. We present an updated version of the MURaM code to enable more accurate simulations of chromospheric hydrogen level populations and temperature evolution. In the previous extension, a non-LTE equation of state, collisional transitions of hydrogen, and radiative transitions of non-Lyman lines were already implemented in the code. Building on this, we have now incorporated radiative transfer for the Lyman lines to compute radiative rate coefficients and the associated radiative losses. These were used to solve the population and temperature evolution equations, rendering the system self-consistent. To reduce computational cost, a single-frequency approximation was applied to each line in the numerical solution of the radiative transfer problem. The extended model shows good agreement with reference solutions from the Lightweaver framework, accurately capturing the radiative processes associated with Lyman lines in the chromosphere. The extension brings the simulated hydrogen level populations in the deep chromosphere closer to detailed radiative balance, while those in the upper chromosphere remain significantly out of balance, consistent with the expected conditions in the real solar atmosphere. The extension enables the MURaM code to accurately capture chromospheric dynamics.",

While the KH instability has been well-studied in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit, only limited studies were performed in the collisionless regime, which is conducive to development of anisotropic pressures. Collisionless plasmas are often described using the Chew Goldberger and Low (CGL) equations which feature an anisotropic pressure tensor. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the CGL version of the KH instability using linearised and numerical techniques. We find that the largest growth rates and the greatest incidence of magnetic effects occur in the MHD limit. In the large relaxation time CGL limit, part of the energy goes into the formation of pressure anisotropies, resulting in smaller amounts of energy being available for bending the field lines. Consequently, when we cross-compare CGL and MHD simulations that are otherwise identical, the current densities are largest in the MHD limit, and the largest magnetic islands also form in that limit. Early and late time formation of pressure anisotropies have also been studied. We also find that the strongest trend for forming intermittencies in the flow also occurs in the MHD limit. The paper also discusses possible consequences of our results for turbulence and reconnection in the heliosheath (the layer between the solar wind termination shock and the heliopause).",

This physically motivated approach offers an alternative to the commonly used method that assumes a fixed flare temperature about of 10 000\\,K and variable area. By allowing the temperature to vary over time while keeping the emitting area constant, our method captures more realistic flare behaviour. This time-dependent treatment of the flare temperature is supported by numerous solar observations, numerical simulations, and multiwavelength studies of active stars. We demonstrate that using peak flare temperatures estimated from a semi-empirical model grid, rather than assuming an ad-hoc flare temperature value, improves the accuracy of total energy estimates. Although the most precise results still require a multi-band photometry/spectroscopy or independently constrained flare temperatures, our method offers a practical and scalable solution for single-band observations. It is particularly well suited for main-sequence stars of spectral types K4 and later with known effective temperatures. Finally we discuss how the flare continuum behaves under varying chromospheric conditions. Our method improves flare energy estimates by incorporating a physically relevant time-dependent temperature evolution and empirically derived peak temperatures, rather than assuming a constant 10 000\\,K value. This modification reduces systematic errors that can reach factors up to ten as compared to previous estimates. We proved this on a sample of 50,320 TESS flares.",

Lund 14 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in A&A, abstract abridged Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Granulation is the observable signature of convection in envelopes of low-mass stars, forming the background in stellar power spectra. While well-studied in evolved giants, granulation on the MS has received less attention. We here study and characterise granulation signatures of MS and SGB stars, extending previous studies of giants to provide a continuous physical picture across evolutionary stages. We analyse 753 Kepler short-cadence stars using a Bayesian nested-sampling framework to evaluate three background descriptions and compare model preferences. This yields full posterior distributions for all parameters, enabling robust comparisons across a diverse stellar sample. No universal preference between background models is found. Assuming a Gaussian oscillation envelope, $\\nu_\\mathrm{max}$ estimates are sensitive to model misspecification, with the resulting systematics exceeding the formal uncertainties. The envelope width scales with $\\nu_\\mathrm{max}$ across models and shows a dependence on effective temperature. Total granulation amplitudes in dwarfs broadly follow giant-based scalings, however a decoupling appears between the timescale of the primary granulation and the oscillations for MS stars cooler than the Sun. The prolonged granulation timescale is reproduced by 3D simulations of a K-dwarf, driven by reduced convective velocities due to more efficient convective energy transport in denser envelopes. The prolonged granulation timescale increases the frequency separation to the oscillation excess, potentially aiding seismic detectability, while the reduced convective velocities may influence the excitation of stellar oscillations and relate to the low amplitudes observed in cool dwarfs. Finally, we contribute a dataset linking granulation, oscillations, and stellar parameters, providing a foundation for future investigations into their interdependence across the HR diagram.",

Brummell Submitted to ApJ. 34 pages and 20 figures Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The Solar Hemispherical Helicity Rule(s) (SHHR) is a term used to represent a bias observed in proxies for the magnetic helicity in active regions at the solar surface. The SHHR states that predominantly negative magnetic helicity is observed in active regions in the northern hemisphere, whereas predominantly positive is found in the southern. The $\\Sigma$-effect model of \\cite{longcope1998flux} is one of the most cited models for the explanation of the SHHR. In this model, the magnetic structures derive the bias in their magnetic helicity from the kinetic helicity of the turbulent convection through which they travel, where the latter is handed owing to the rotational influence of the star. The original paper built an elegant mathematical model for the dynamics of thin flux tubes influenced by parameterized helical turbulence. Here, we attempt to explore the conceptual ideas of this original simplified model using fully-nonlinear, three-dimensional, Cartesian-domain simulations of isolated, finite cross-sectional, twisted magnetic flux structures rising though rotating, overshooting, turbulent compressible convection. We look for evidence of a correlation between the kinetic helicity content of the turbulence and the evolving magnetic helicity of the structures. We find little evidence of such a relationship, and do not even find any clear hemispheric dependence. Although these simulations are far from a perfect representation of the ideas, this work raises many questions about the potential efficacy of the $\\Sigma$-effect in reality.",

Chaplin, Rachel Howe, Yvonne Elsworth, Steven J. Hale, Eleanor Murray Accepted for publication in MNRAS Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We have used data collected by the Birmingham Solar-Oscillations Network (BiSON) to perform a helioseismic diagnosis of changes to the Sun's internal structure between four successive solar cycle minima, beginning with the minimum at the end of cycle 21 and ending with the recent minimum at the beginning of cycle 25. The unique duration of the BiSON database makes such a study possible. We used the low-degree BiSON p-mode frequencies to constrain structural changes between minima in the layers above $\\approx 0.9 R_{\\odot}$. We accomplished this by examining variations in the HeII ionisation zone signature; and by inverting the frequency differences to infer changes in the sound speed. Additionally, we employed frequency differences between various solar models that had subtle modifications to their internal structures to facilitate analysis of the observations. We find evidence for small, but marginally significant, changes in structure between different minima. The HeII signature was larger, and the sound speed in the range $\\approx 0.93$ to $0.97 R_{\\odot}$ was slightly higher, during the cycle 23/24 minimum, than during the other minima. The cycle 23/24 minimum was the deepest, as measured by proxies of global solar activity. These findings are consistent with magnetic flux levels having been lower in this minimum than the others, resulting in a higher gas pressure, higher temperatures, and higher sound speed. Our results demonstrate the potential of using asteroseismic data to perform similar analyses on other solar-type stars.",

Currently, this problem is addressed by employing statistical and physics-based models that take into account particle transport and precipitation. However, given the increased number of radiation measurements available to the community, it is possible to start developing data-driven approaches. We prepared Machine Learning-ready (ML-ready) datasets to nowcast the effective dose rates at aviation altitudes. The presented datasets contain 92,476 individual measurements from 589 flights obtained by the Automated Radiation Measurements for Aerospace Safety (ARMAS) experiment from 2013 to 2023. The ARMAS measurements are augmented with the properties of the Geospace environment, such as solar soft X-ray and proton fluxes, solar wind properties, secondary cosmic ray neutrons, space weather indexes, and global solar activity indicators (such as daily sunspot number). ARMAS data are separated into three partitions, ensuring that (1) the data points from a single flight remain within the same partition, and (2) each partition samples the flight locations and Geospace environment conditions equally. Several versions of the datasets allow predictions based on point-in-time measurements and use up to 24 hours of Geospace parameter history. The test of the use case demonstrates a possibility of nowcasting ARMAS measurements with accuracies slightly better than the considered physics-based models. The publicly available ML-ready datasets could serve as the first step in data preparation for ML-driven nowcasting and forecasting of the radiation environment.",

The fast image stabilisation is done by a correlation tracker (CT) and a fast tip-tilt mirror, low order aberrations such as defocus and coma are measured by a six-element Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (WFS) and corrected by an active telescope secondary mirror for automated focus and manual coma correction. The CWS is specified to deliver a stabilised image with a precision of 0.005 arcsec (rms). The autofocus adjustment is specified to maintain a focus stability of 0.01 waves in the focal plane of the CWS.",

Out of the sample of 11, we find support for companions in seven systems, with significant detections in three. These systems are: HD 142527, where we clearly detect the known low-mass stellar companion HD 142527 B; AB Aurigae, where we detect a low-mass stellar or sub-stellar companion; and MWC 758, where we detect a likely sub-stellar companion. We also find strong evidence of companions to HD 97048 and UX Tau A, and moderate evidence for companions to HD 100546 and CQ Tau. In the four systems with non-detections, we find no evidence for companions more massive than $\\sim$6 $M_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$ with a semi-major axis greater than 3 au for HD 100453, nor for companions more massive than $\\sim$2 $M_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$ with a semi-major axis greater than 2 au for TW Hya. We also find no evidence for stellar mass companions with semi-major axes between $\\sim$3 and $\\sim$25 au for both HD 34282 and RY Lup. In addition to our fiducial model, we perform cross validation between astrometry sources. By comparing results across models, we find tentative evidence of a short timescale excess astrometric noise that may impact some protoplanetary disk systems. We conclude with predictions for the prospects of making dynamical mass constraints on protoplanets in protoplanetary disk systems with Gaia data release 4 using detailed simulations of Gaia DR4 data of PDS 70 and WISPIT 2.",

Such circumplanetary outflows have been proposed to explain kinematic and chemical structures in protoplanetary disks. We investigate the immediate impact of circumplanetary outflows on the circumstellar disk environment, the planetary vicinity, and planetary growth. We performed three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using \\texttt{FARGO3D}, implementing a parametric wind launched from the vicinity of an embedded planet. Although the imposed configurations for the outflows do not significantly alter the global structure of the disk, they do substantially redistribute material in the vicinity of the embedded planet. In particular, the wind redirects accretion flows from polar to equatorial latitudes, resulting in variable accretion patterns over time. Although the mass accretion rate variations depend on the efficiency of the outflows, their presence diminishes the accretion rate over time and the total mass reservoir within the Hill sphere and the planet's direct vicinity, potentially slowing or limiting planetary growth.",

The Spitzer mid-IR photometry suggests that the temperature is as cold as 350K, making it one of the coldest directly imaged exoplanets. In this paper, we present the Near-infrared Camera (NIRCam) F150W2, F200W, F356W, and F444W broadband photometry and a 3--5\\um Near-Infrared spectroscopy (NIRSpec) G395M spectrum obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We develop a new retrieval framework based on the open-source PICASO software that includes additive and multiplicative systematic parameters. Our retrieval results reveal bounded abundances of H$_2$S, CO$_2$, CO, NH$_3$, H$_2$O, and CH$_4$. We present a new chemical analysis framework that utilizes retrieved abundances to measure altitude-dependent eddy diffusion coefficients (K$_{\\mathrm zz}$) at multiple quenched pressures. We find that the eddy diffusion coefficients decrease from around $10^4$ to $10^2$ $\\rm cm^2/s$ as the atmospheric pressure decreases from from 50 to 20 bars. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report altitude-dependent vertical mixing (or, equivalently, quenched-species-dependent vertical mixing) based on the measured molecular abundances of CO, CH$_4$, and CO$_2$. With the 1--21\\um NIRCam, NIRSpec and the previously published MIRI data, we measure the bolometric luminosity to be log(L/L$_{\\odot}$) = $-6.75\\pm0.01$ and derive the mass to be $8\\pm 1 \\mathrm{M_J}$. The retrieval results suggest that \\target has an elevated C/O ratio of 0.76, or 1.3$\\times$ solar, sub-solar metallicity ([M/H ]= -0.25), and a nearly solar C/S ratio (1.17x solar).",

Valori 10 pages, 8 figures, under review in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (SO/PHI) onboard Solar Orbiter is a spectropolarimeter scanning the Fe I line at 617.3 nm, providing data of the solar photosphere. The same line is sampled by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and many other on-ground instruments. In this paper, we aim at assessing the consistency between line-of-sight (LoS) velocity measurements from the two instruments. Reliable measurements of up and down flows from SO/PHI are crucial and unique when Solar Orbiter is facing the far side of the Sun. Also, a combination of measurements from two vantage points to study horizontal flows must rely on consistent observations. For this purpose, we compare the LoS velocity measured by SO/PHI's High Resolution Telescope (SO/PHI-HRT) and SDO/HMI on 29 March 2023, when Solar Orbiter was crossing the Sun-Earth line at a distance of 0.39 au from the Sun. Because such co-alignments are rare, this configuration offered an almost unique opportunity to directly compare data products from both telescopes. The data are aligned and remapped to allow a pixel-by-pixel comparison of the whole time series of 4 hours length. Temporal and spatial variations are considered for a direct combination of the measurements. The LoS velocity distributions are evaluated and a clear linear relation is found between the two instruments with a slope of 0.96 and a correlation of 92%. We find that the signals form at similar heights, with a separation of 7$\\pm$14 km, which is larger than previous estimates. A close-up look at the penumbra of a sunspot and its Evershed flow is presented. We conclude that the signals inferred by SO/PHI-HRT and SDO/HMI show very good agreement and high correlation when instrumental effects and large-scale velocities on the Sun are properly accounted for.",

To assess CME geoeffectiveness, among other scientific goals, it is necessary to reliably identify and characterize their morphology and kinematics in coronagraph images. Current methods of CME identification are either subjected to human biases or perform a poor identification due to deficiencies in the automatic detection. In this approach, we have trained the deep convolutional neural model Mask R-CNN to automatically segment the outer envelope of one or multiple CMEs present in a single difference coronagraph image. The empirical training dataset is composed of 10^5 synthetic coronagraph images with known pixel-level CME segmentation masks. It is obtained by combining quiet coronagraph observations, with synthetic white-light CMEs produced using the GCS geometric model and ray-tracing technique. We found that our model-based trained Mask R-CNN infers segmentation masks that are smooth and topologically connected. While the inferred masks are not representative of the detailed outer envelope of complex CMEs, the neural model can better differentiate a CME from other radially moving background/foreground features, segment multiple simultaneous CMEs that are close to each other, and work with images from different instruments. This is accomplished without relying on kinematic information, i.e. only the included in the single input difference image. We obtain a median IoU=0.98 for 1.6*10^4 synthetic validation images, and IoU=0.77 when compared with two independent manual segmentations of 115 observations acquired by the COR2-A, COR2-B and LASCO C2 coronagraphs. The methodology presented in this work can be used with other CME models to produce more realistic synthetic brightness images while preserving desired morphological features, and obtain more robust and/or tailored segmentations.",

Among other things, they demonstrated that although the damping rate of the oscillations in the core of many red giants appears to be negligible, other red giants exhibit high core damping rates that are sometimes consistent with the infinite value limit. Up until now, it has not been possible to link the mixed mode visibilities to core damping rates in a quantitative way. In this study, we use the progressive wave picture to derive an analytical function expressing the approximate resonance pattern of red giants up to a proportionality factor. This function can model the influence of the damping on the oscillations, as well as take into account other effects such as mode asymmetries. In particular, this expression can be used to obtain a quantitative estimate for the visibility of mixed modes and to predict the detectability of mixed mode and multiplet signatures under different core damping rates. Here, we conduct a parameter study to investigate how the damping processes affect these aspects. We find that the visibility approaches the value expected for an infinite core damping rate already at finite values. Furthermore, we find that both the mixed mode and the multiplet signatures disappear at finite core damping rates. This implies that the observational characteristics of red giants with finite core damping rates can appear as if their core damping rate were infinite, providing an explanation for the observed populations. Moreover, we have used our method to quantitatively estimate the core damping rates of red giants with unusually low mixed mode amplitudes from their observed visibilities.",

We focus on shear-driven instabilities, specifically the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke (GSF) instability and the magnetorotational instability (MRI), which are expected to play key roles in the internal dynamics of radiative regions. We carried out a local linear stability analysis using a numerical approach that extends beyond classical limiting cases and includes stabilizing effects such as stratification and magnetic tension, allowing the exploration of realistic flow regimes. These results were validated through a global mode analysis in a Taylor-Couette configuration. We recovered the standard MRI and azimuthal MRI stability criteria and quantified the effects of stratification, magnetic tension, and diffusion on their growth. In strongly sheared regimes, we derived a new criterion for the magnetised GSF (MGSF) instability and clarified the transition from SMRI to MGSF as stratification and magnetic effects narrow the unstable domain. We also provided approximate growth-time formulae that identify the dominant instability under given stellar conditions and can be implemented in 1D stellar evolution codes. Global Taylor-Couette calculations validate the local WKB analysis. Applied to subgiants and young red giants, our results show that shear-driven instabilities can grow rapidly for magnetic fields below 100 kG. Strong axial fields (100 kG) confined to the hydrogen-burning shell suppress instabilities unless the shear is sufficiently distant. These results support incorporating our criteria and growth estimates into stellar evolution models to assess the efficiency of shear-driven transport.",

We derive elemental abundances and temperature-pressure ($T$-$P$) profiles while explicitly testing the robustness of the results against major sources of systematic uncertainty. We first perform retrievals with a power-law $T$-$P$ profile and assess the sensitivity of inferred molecular abundances and C/O ratios to different CO line lists (ExoMol, HITEMP with air- and H2-broadening). We then introduce a flexible Gaussian process-based $T$-$P$ profile, allowing a non-parametric characterization of the thermal structure and a more conservative treatment of uncertainties. For both components, we infer C/O ratios of about 0.67, slightly above solar, with line list systematics at the 7 percent level emerging as the dominant source of uncertainty, whereas assumptions about $T$-$P$ parameterization or photometric variability play a lesser role. The retrieved $T$-$P$ profiles and molecular abundances are broadly consistent with atmospheric models and equilibrium chemistry. Our results establish Luhman 16AB as a key anchor for substellar C/O measurements, demonstrate the utility of flexible $T$-$P$ modeling in high-resolution retrievals, and highlight the importance of systematic tests -- particularly line list uncertainties -- for robust comparisons between brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets.",

The solar wind velocity of 200 kilometers per second and ion temperature of 25 eV were significantly reduced as compared to their values in the ambient solar wind. These anomalous plasma conditions were observed on closed magnetic field lines, as determined from observations of the suprathermal electron strahl. Because the polarity of the radial magnetic field did not change sign on the two sides of the crossing and the crossed region contained a double-peaked plasma structure, the spacecraft must have passed through the base of a pseudo-streamer whose structure extended out to 10 solar radii. In the plasma frame, an electric field as large as 400 millivolts per meter was detected during the crossing. The current associated with this electric field was less than one milliampere per square meter, corresponding to a drift velocity less than 2.5 kilometers per second. It also contained a turbulent plasma with density fluctuations divided by density as large as 0.3, suggesting that the resistive term in the generalized ohm's law was significant. Also, the density as a function of time had a non-zero slope when the electric field was non-zero, suggesting that the pressure gradient term also mattered. As compared to earlier remote sensing and theoretical results, it is surprising that the plasma in this pseudo-streamer had a remarkably low flow velocity and that the pseudo-streamer base extended out to 10 solar radii.",

It provides a set of tools and libraries that enable researchers to create custom hardware and software solutions for processing astronomical data. The CASPER toolflow has been instrumental in the development of Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based digital instruments for various radio telescopes, enabling for real-time data processing and analysis. However, the current frontend tool that CASPER uses for high-level FPGA design is based on Model Composer integrated into MATLAB/Simulink, which is a proprietary software. In this paper, we introduce Scilab as a new frontend tool for the CASPER toolflow. Scilab is an open-source software platform for numerical computation and data visualization, which offers a similar environment to MATLAB/Simulink for designing CASPER blocks, generating FPGA Intellectual Property (IP) cores, and simulating Digital Signal Processing (DSP) systems. We present our implementation of Scilab in the CASPER toolflow and demonstrate its capabilities by developing an FPGA based spectrometer on a RFSoC4x2, a commonly used CASPER platform well suited to radio astronomy applications.

Spanning approximately 14 years of observations from October 2009 to February 2024, the study analyzes CTE flux loss trends across various total background levels and source fluxes. In addition to analyzing the present state of CTE flux losses, we provide updated coefficients for the empirical model for point source photometry corrections in both non-CTE-corrected (FLT) and CTE-corrected (FLC) data. Between 2009 and 2023, the rate of CTE flux loss for a 500-2000 e$^-$ source, farthest from the readout, in FLT data with a 1-3 e$^-$/pix background, is measured to be $\\sim$0.05 $\\Delta$mag/2051 pix/year. The recommended minimum total background level to mitigate CTE losses remains at 20-25 e$^-$/pix. At that level, we find that 500-2000 e$^-$ sources, farthest from the readout, in 2024 FLT data can suffer $\\sim$23$\\%$ flux loss/2051 pix. The FLC data provide some relief, but we measure a $\\sim$12$\\%$ flux loss/2051 pix in 2024. There continues to be a slight over-correction in some FLC results that contain backgrounds above 40 e$^-$/pix. In 2024, 8000-20000 e$^-$ sources farthest from the readout in a 40, 60, or 90 e$^-$/pix background are over-corrected by $\\sim$1, 2, and 3$\\%$, respectively.",

It is a manifestation of the innate human curiosity about the Cosmos, and it has inspired numerous works of art and folklore, including whole literary and other media genres. It is a profound question, with philosophical and existential implications. There is also an obvious connection with religious beliefs, as gods and other superhuman beings were imagined in the heavens. Speculations about alien beings grew in time, and today, it is a scientific subject of astrobiology, and it is pursued through serious searches for life and intelligence in the universe. However, almost all imaginings of the alien map terrestrial life forms and human cultural, historical, and psychological phenomena to the putative aliens. This lack of individual and collective imagination may reflect our biological and cultural evolution, as our minds are formed through our experiences, perceptions of the world, and interactions with our terrestrial and human environments. As such, imagining aliens is mainly a cultural phenomenon and may reflect the intrinsic cognitive limitations of the human mind. Interestingly, we did create what is effectively an alien intelligence on this planet in the form of now rapidly evolving Artificial Intelligence (AI). As its capabilities grow, it may give us new insights into what extraterrestrial advanced intelligences may be like.",

In this work, we evaluated a series of open-weight and commercial VLMs on six tasks relevant to radio astronomy, such as source morphology classification. We also introduced radio-llava, a fine-tuned multimodal assistant built on the LLaVA architecture and adapted for the radio domain through instruction fine-tuning. In zero-shot mode, commercial models like GPT-4.1 outperform open-weight VLMs on most radio benchmarks. However, radio-llava significantly improves upon both base LLaVA and commercial models across nearly all tasks. Despite these gains, specialized vision-only models still deliver substantially better performance across the board. Additionally, we observed that fine-tuning introduces catastrophic forgetting on general multimodal tasks, with performance drops up to 40% that can be partly mitigated with a more diverse training dataset or shallow fine-tuning.",

We describe the system configuration, remote operation, and data reduction pipeline, and evaluate its optical and photometric performance using commissioning data. SOLO achieves stable photometric calibration across the 11.6 deg^2 field of view and reaches a 10-sigma limiting magnitude of G ~ 17.5 for a 180 sec exposure. Sample asteroid light curves obtained over multiple nights demonstrate consistent absolute photometry at the same rotational phase, validating the estimated performance. Finally, we outline the planned operational use of SOLO in connection with NASA's SPHEREx mission. Full science operations of SOLO are scheduled to begin in January 2026. Using these data, we aim to obtain on the order of 10^3 absolutely calibrated asteroid light curves per year in the Gaia G-band, which will be used to support the construction and scientific utilization of the SPHEREx SSOC.",

      "abstract": "Particle hydrodynamics with accurate gradients: a comparison of different formulations S. Rosswog Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We compare here several modern versions of SPH with a particular focus on the impact of gradient accuracy. We examine specifically an approximation to the \"linearly exact\" gradients (aLE) with standard SPH kernel gradients and with linearly reproducing kernels (RPKs) that fulfill the lowest order consistency relations exactly by construction. Most of the explored SPH formulations use shock dissipation (i.e. artificial viscosity and conductivity) with slope-limited reconstruction and parameters that trigger on both shocks and noise. We also compare with a recent particle hydrodynamics formulation that uses both RPKs and Roe's approximate Riemann solver instead of shock dissipation. Not too surprisingly, we find that the shock tests are rather insensitive to the gradient accuracy, but whenever instabilities are involved the gradient accuracy plays a crucial role. The reproducing kernel gradients perform best, but they are closely followed by the much simpler aLE gradients. The Riemann solver approach has some (minor) advantages in the shock tests, but shows some resistance against instability growth and at low resolution the corresponding Kelvin-Helmholtz simulations show substantially slower instability growth than the best shock dissipation approaches. Based on the battery of benchmark tests performed here, we consider a shock dissipation approach with reproducing kernels (our versions $V_3$ and $V_5$) as best, but closely followed by a similar version ($V_2$) that uses the simpler and computationally cheaper aLE gradients.",

FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data is often a vital step towards testing the reproducibility of results. The implementation of FAIR principles in the astrophysical simulation community is still varied. We approach the discussion of this topic mainly from a high-performance computing (HPC) point of view. We identify the main obstacles to FAIR astrophysics simulations: First, the vast datasets created in simulations on HPC facilities complicate FAIR data management. Second, missing incentives to fully share codes, results, and diagnostic data. Third, a lack of workflows that include data publication and technical support. Therefore, particularly smaller research groups struggle due to the unavailability of dedicated personnel and time in their efforts towards FAIR and open simulations. We propose actionable steps towards achieving ``FAIRer'' data and open source publication standards in numerical astrophysics. Our suggestions include low-threshold methods to fulfil the basic FAIR requirements as well as basic tools for FAIR (meta-)data generation and data/code publication. This work is a high-level overview intended to initiate discussions within the community, offering initial solutions to these challenges.",

Mandell Submitted to AAS Journals; comments and suggestions are welcome Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We introduce a new time-series analysis strategy for combined-light exoplanet spectroscopic phase curves called the Variable Planetary Infrared Excess (VPIE) method. VPIE can be used to extract information about the planetary flux contribution without the need for the planet to transit, or use of a stellar spectral model. VPIE utilizes a linear combination of a small set of individual spectra to produce an empirical model of the stellar contribution at each time step, thereby normalizing each spectrum and leaving only an imprint of the planet's flux in the residual data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VPIE through simulated James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of three known exoplanet orbiting late-type M stars: the warm giant TOI-519 b, the warm sub-Neptune GJ 876 d, and the temperate super-Earth Proxima Centauri b. Our results indicate that though VPIE loses sensitivity for very high redistribution values, it can successfully distinguish between various atmospheric circulation regimes (zero, moderate, or high heat redistribution) and constrain planetary radii for non-unity day-night temperature ratios. While performance for cooler targets may be limited by JWST spectroscopic capabilities at longer wavelengths, future VPIE improvements or new instrumentation could enable characterization of potentially habitable planets. VPIE offers a promising new framework for pulling back the veil on the population of non-transiting planets around nearby M-stars that are otherwise inaccessible to current techniques.",

It is currently under review at Space Science Reviews Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The renewed interest in lunar exploration and the development of future lunar communication and navigation services highlight the need for a precise, stable, and interoperable geodetic and timing infrastructure on the Moon. NovaMoon, proposed as a scientific and navigation payload for ESA's Argonaut lander, is designed as a lunar-based local differential, geodetic, and timing station supporting both operational needs in the Moon's south polar region and a broad range of scientific investigations. The payload integrates a lunar laser retroreflector, a Very Long Baseline Interferometry transmitter, a receiver for navigation signals compatible with LunaNet standards, high-stability atomic clocks, and direct-to-Earth radio links -- making it the first lunar station to co-locate multiple ranging, tracking, and timing techniques. NovaMoon will enable sub-metre to decimetre positioning, provide local differential corrections for lunar users, and ensure an accurate and stable realisation of position and time. Preliminary simulation studies show that this multi-technique dataset improves the lunar reference frame, orientation and ephemerides, and estimates of interior parameters like tidal response and core properties. NovaMoon will also provide the first long-duration physical realisation of a lunar time reference. Beyond its primary goals, it supports improved cartography, precise surface geolocation, and higher-resolution topography, contributing to safer landings and operations. It also enables new tests of fundamental physics, including constraints on relativity and possible deviations from classical gravity.",

This is about finding facts. Meridian circles provided fundamental star positions for centuries. These positions were tied to a well-defined celestial coordinate system of right ascension and declination, and accurate proper motions ensured a transformation of the positions over long periods of time. This function of the meridian circles has been taken over by space astrometry and VLBI. The Hipparcos astrometric satellite was approved by ESA in 1980 and launched to a successful 3-year mission in 1989. Its successor, Gaia, completed a mission of 10.5 years in January 2025. An account is given of the last 18 meridian instruments, which were active for some part of the 35 years between 1980 and 2015. This account is based on input kindly supplied in correspondence with many colleagues.",

Submitted to SPIE Optics and Photonics Astronomical Applications Proceedings Volume 13627, Techniques and Instrumentation for Detection of Exoplanets XI, paper #13627-21 Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Kernel phase interferometry (KPI) is a post-processing technique that treats a conventional telescope as an interferometer by accurately modeling a telescope pupil as an array of virtual subapertures. KPI provides angular resolution within the diffraction limit by eliminating instrumental phase errors to first order. It has been successfully demonstrated to boost angular resolution on both space- and ground-based observatories, and is especially useful for enhancing space telescopes, as their diameters are smaller than the largest ground-based facilities. Here we present the first demonstration of KPI on JWST/MIRI data at 7.7 microns, 10 microns, and 15 microns. We generate contrast curves for 16 white dwarfs from the MIRI Exoplanets Orbiting White dwarfs (MEOW) Survey, finding significantly deeper contrast at small angular separations compared to traditional imaging with JWST/MIRI, down to within $\\lambda$/D. Additionally, we use our KPI setup to successfully recover four known companions orbiting white dwarfs and brown dwarfs. This analysis shows that at these wavelengths KPI can uniquely access the orbital parameter space where inward-migrating post-main-sequence giant exoplanets are now thought to exist. We discuss the prospects for applying KPI to a larger sample of white dwarfs observed with JWST, increasing the volume of directly imaged close-in post-main-sequence exoplanets.",

The proposed method combines osculating orbital elements, Chebyshev polynomials, and Fourier series to efficiently represent lunar satellite trajectories subject to complex perturbations from lunar gravity and third-body effects. For the ephemeris, a hybrid Chebyshev--Fourier formulation improves fitting accuracy over long arcs while maintaining message compactness under the data-size constraint of the LunaNet Interoperability Specification. For the almanac, a compact low-order polynomial and Fourier model is introduced to capture mid-term orbital variations over a 15-day fitting arc. The approach is validated for multiple orbit regimes, including 30-hour, 24-hour, and 12-hour elliptical lunar frozen orbits (ELFOs) and a 6-hour polar orbit. Results show that the proposed framework achieves sub-meter position and sub-millimeter-per-second velocity fitting errors within the 900-bit limit for 6-hour ephemeris arcs, and almanac fitting accuracy sufficient for reliable satellite-visibility identification in warm-start operations.",

In this work, we focus on applying these methods to fundamental problems in image compression and processing and classical optics such as wave-front propagation and optical image formation, by using directly or indirectly parallels with quantum mechanics and computation.

Foster Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The 2023 perihelion passage of comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) afforded an opportunity to measure the abundances and spatial distributions of coma volatiles in an Oort cloud comet at high spatial resolution near its close approach to Earth ($\\Delta_\\mathrm{min}\\sim 0.28$ au on UT February 1). We conducted near-infrared spectroscopic observations of C/2022 E3 (ZTF) using iSHELL at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility on UT 2023 February 9. Our measurements securely detected fluorescent emission from H$_2$O, CO, OCS, CH$_3$OH, CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, C$_2$H$_2$, and HCN. For each instrumental setting we took exposures with the slit oriented parallel and also perpendicular to the projected Sun-comet vector, thereby enabling a test of the spatial distributions of these molecules. We report rotational temperatures, production rates, and abundance ratios (i.e., mixing ratios) for all sampled species. Our measurements found that molecular abundances in C/2022 E3 were depleted compared to their average values in Oort cloud comets with the exception of OCS, which was consistent. The H$_2$O production rate varied significantly and was likely tied to nucleus rotation effects. Measurements at the two slit orientations showed distinct column density and rotational temperature profiles for H$_2$O. Peak temperatures occurred off-nucleus and slower cooling was present in the anti-sunward hemisphere, consistent with the presence of icy grain sublimation in the coma.",

Population studies of disks large-sample size surveys show that substructures, and their rapid formation, are needed to reproduce the observed spectral indices. Moreover, they enable the simultaneous reproduction of the observed spectral index and size-luminosity distributions. This study aims to investigate the necessity of substructures and predict their characteristics to reproduce gas-to-dust size ratios observed in the Lupus star-forming region. We performed a population synthesis study of gas and dust evolution in disks using a two-population model (two-pop-py) and the DustPy code. We considered the effects of viscous evolution, dust growth, fragmentation, transport, and external photoevaporation. The simulated population distributions were obtained by post-processing the resulting disk profiles of surface density, maximum grain size, and disk temperature. Although substructures help reduce the discrepancy between simulated and observed disk gas-to-dust size ratios; even when accounting for external photoevaporation, they do not fully resolve it. Only specific initial conditions in disks undergoing viscous evolution with external photoevaporation can reproduce the observations, highlighting a fine-tuning problem. While substructured disks reproduce dust size and spectral index, they tend to overestimate gas radii. The results ultimately highlight the main challenge of simultaneously reproducing gas and dust sizes. One possible explanation is that the outermost substructure is linked to the disk truncation radius, which determines the gas radius, or that substructures are frequent enough to always be near the gas outer radius.",

Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Context. The origin of the petrologic diversity observed in ordinary chondrites (OCs), the most common meteorites on Earth, remains debated. Competing models invoke either depth-dependent sampling of a single thermally stratified (\"onion-shell\") parent body or contributions from multiple distinct parent bodies. Aims. We aim to determine which of the two models is preferred for LL chondrites. These are unique among OCs in exhibiting a bimodal petrologic distribution, with most meteorites being LL3 or LL6. Methods. We compare the spectral and mineralogical properties of LL chondrites and corresponding LL-chondrite-like near-Earth objects (NEOs) with their possible sources in the main asteroid belt. We also model the thermal histories of the proposed parent bodies, based on revised estimates of parent-body sizes. Results. The spectral and mineralogical diversity of LL chondrites is consistent with contributions from the bright, S-type component of the Nysa family (NysaS) and the Flora family, with NysaS supplying mainly low-petrologic-type material and Flora higher-grade material. Unequilibrated, LL3 chondrites appear to originate exclusively from NysaS. Similarly, LL-chondrite-like NEOs form two distinct subpopulations consistent with origins in these same families. Conclusions. Our results favour multiple parent bodies for LL chondrites. The petrologic differences between the NysaS and Flora parent bodies indicate that planetesimal accretion within the OC reservoir extended over 0.5-0.7 Myr.",

Cortés-Zuleta Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) GJ 877 is a bright M dwarf in the solar neighborhood with two currently reported nontransiting exoplanets with periods of $9~\\mathrm{d}$ and $21~\\mathrm{d,}$ along with an additional unconfirmed signal at $50~\\mathrm{d}$. We reanalyzed the system with 101 new HARPS and 12 new ESPRESSO radial velocities (RVs) secured with a cadence to confirm or refute the origin of the $50~\\mathrm{d}$ signal. To do so, we searched for signals related to stellar activity in photometric data and spectroscopic indicators. We modeled the stellar activity in the RVs with Gaussian processes (GPs). With the Bayesian analysis, we confirmed a four-planet model, including the two previously known planets at periods of $9.2619\\pm0.0005~\\mathrm{d}$ and $21.784\\pm0.004~\\mathrm{d,}$ as well as two newly confirmed exoplanets: an Earth-mass planet, with a $4.42490\\pm0.00014~\\mathrm{d}$ period and a sub-meter-per-second amplitude, and a super-Earth with a $50.77\\pm0.05~\\mathrm{d}$ period located in the habitable zone (HZ). This super-Earth is the second closest planet in the HZ, after Proxima Cen b. We found an additional signal in a 2:1 resonance with the $4.4~\\mathrm{d}$ planet at $2.21661\\pm0.00010~\\mathrm{d}$ with an amplitude of $0.37\\pm0.09~\\mathrm{m/s}$, which could be related to an additional planet. However, other explanations of its origin are also plausible. This signal remains a candidate, as further investigation is required to confirm its true nature. If the signal is caused by a planet, its minimum mass would be half that of Earth. We measured the stellar rotation period with the characteristic periodic timescale of the GP. We found a period of $38.7\\pm0.5~\\mathrm{d}$, which is consistent with the rotation period determined from photometry and other activity indices.",

Using the empirically calibrated low-discrepancy uncertainty model of Peña-Asensio et al.\\ (2025) for post-2018 CNEOS velocity accuracy (1$\\sigma$: speed 0.55~km~s$^{-1}$, right ascension 1.35$^\\circ$, declination 0.84$^\\circ$), we transform CNEOS velocity vectors to heliocentric orbits and assess interstellar candidacy via $10^{6}$-draw Monte Carlo simulations. Two post-2018 events have heliocentric speeds robustly exceeding the Solar System escape speed. CNEOS-22 (2022-07-28; 6.0$^\\circ$S, 86.9$^\\circ$W; eastern tropical Pacific) has $v_{\\rm hel}=46.98$~km~s$^{-1}$, exceeding escape by $\\Delta = 5.18 \\pm 0.60$~km~s$^{-1}$ ($z_{\\Delta}=8.7\\sigma$), with interstellar speed $v_{\\infty,\\odot}=21.5$~km~s$^{-1}$. CNEOS-25 (2025-02-12; 73.4$^\\circ$N, 49.3$^\\circ$E; Barents Sea) has $v_{\\rm hel}=45.63$~km~s$^{-1}$, exceeding escape by $\\Delta = 3.22 \\pm 0.58$~km~s$^{-1}$ ($z_{\\Delta}=5.5\\sigma$), with $v_{\\infty,\\odot}=16.9$~km~s$^{-1}$. For both events, none of $10^{6}$ realizations yield a gravitationally bound orbit ($p_{\\rm bound} < 3\\times 10^{-6}$). The adopted error model would need to underestimate the true uncertainties by factors of 5--9 for either candidate to be marginally bound.",
