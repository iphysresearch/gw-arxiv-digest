      "abstract": "How Dark is Dark Energy? A Lightcones Comparison Approach Mauro Carfora, Francesca Familiari Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph) We present a geometrical approach that provides a non-perturbative technique, allowing the standard FLRW observer to evaluate a measurable, scale-dependent distance functional between her idealized FLRW past light cone and the actual physical past light cone. From the point of view of the FLRW observer, gathering data from sources at cosmological redshift $\\widehat{z}$, this functional generates a geometry--structure--growth contribution ${\\Omega_\\Lambda(\\widehat{z})}$ to the FLRW cosmological constant ${\\widehat\\Omega_\\Lambda}$. This redshift--dependent contribution erodes the interpretation of ${\\widehat\\Omega_\\Lambda}$ as representing constant dark energy. In particular, ${\\Omega_\\Lambda(\\widehat{z})}$ becomes significantly large at very low $\\widehat{z}$, where structures dominate the cosmological landscape. At the pivotal galaxy cluster scale, where cosmological expansion decouples from the local gravitation dynamics, we get ${\\Omega_\\Lambda(\\widehat{z})/\\widehat\\Omega_\\Lambda}\\,=\\,\\mathscr{O}(1)$, showing that late--epoch structures provide an effective field contribution to the FLRW cosmological constant that is of the same order of magnitude as its assumed value. We prove that ${\\Omega_\\Lambda(\\widehat{z})}$ is generated by a scale-dependent effective field governed by structure formation and related to the comparison between the idealized FLRW past light cone and the actual physical past light cone. These results are naturally framed in the mainstream FLRW cosmology; they do not require exotic fields and provide a natural setting for analyzing the coincidence problem, leading to an interpretative shift in the current understanding of constant dark energy.",

Understanding the physics of these processes remains a major challenge. Black holes have traditionally served as the central engines behind such phenomena, with well established energy extraction mechanisms including the Penrose process, the Blandford-Znajek process, and the Banados-Silk-West mechanism. However, studies in general relativity indicate that, under certain conditions, gravitational collapse may lead to the formation of naked singularities or other horizonless compact objects, which could in principle allow more efficient energy extraction than classical black holes. This brief review summarizes recent progress on energy extraction mechanisms in naked singularity spacetimes. We examine the roles of rotation, electromagnetic fields, and particle interactions in shaping extraction efficiency and dynamics. Particular attention is given to negative energy orbits and ergoregion physics, which enable Penrose type and magnetic Penrose mechanisms without an event horizon. We also discuss collisional Penrose processes and particle acceleration near the singularity, emphasizing their potential astrophysical implications. By comparing extraction efficiencies and physical conditions in black holes and naked singularities, we highlight how the absence of a horizon fundamentally alters the dynamics of energy release. These results suggest that naked singularities may serve as natural laboratories for strong field gravity and as alternative engines for high-energy astrophysical phenomena in the era of multi-messenger observations.",

The detection of GW190425 by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) suggests a subpopulation of massive BNSs, possibly formed through unstable \"case BB\" mass transfer with short merger delays. We investigate whether next-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) can identify and characterise such subpopulations. Using the latest LVK constraints on the BNS merger rate, we generate mock ET catalogues containing a mixture of light and heavy subpopulations. The redshift distribution of each subpopulation is modeled as the convolution of the cosmic star formation rate with a time-delay distribution: heavy BNSs have fixed short delays, while light BNSs follow power-law delays with indices -0.5,-1,-1.5. Hierarchical Bayesian analyses are then performed on catalogues of 100-5,000 events. With hundreds of detections from ET, we will be able to establish that the total mass distribution is bimodal. A few thousand events are sufficient to disentangle the redshift distributions of the two subpopulations for moderate time-delay indices (-0.5 or -1). For steeper indices (-1.5), the differences are more subtle, requiring larger catalogues, beyond what we could explore given our computational resources. Next-generation detectors should enable the detection of multiple BNS subpopulations and their redshift evolution, providing valuable insight into their formation pathways.",

Comments are welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Recent observations show a persistent tension in the Hubble constant $H_0$, suggesting an incomplete understanding of cosmic expansion and local dynamics. Using the Cosmicflows-4 catalogue, we mapped the angular and radial variations of $H_0$ in radial shells with a distance modulus $\\mu \\in [29,36]$ (approximately corresponding to $[20,100]$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc) and equal-area sky patches, applied adaptive weighing, and fitted spherical harmonics up to the octupole. Our results reveal a clear, distance-decreasing dipole that remains coherent across shells, with subdominant higher-order multipoles, and the octupole fit capturing the main anisotropic features except in sparsely sampled or SDSS-dominated shells. The direction and amplitude of the dipole depend on whether the observed radial recessional velocities are corrected for peculiar velocities or not. If the correction is not applied, the dipole aligns with the major gravitational structures in the local universe. If it is applied, a global dipole still seems to be present, but the signal is much weaker and with much lower statistical significance. This decrease in the amplitude of the dipole supports the idea of a differential expansion rate in our universe, but does not clarify whether the origin is astrophysical or cosmological. Finally, we verify that, while this anisotropy could influence local measurements of the Hubble constant, its effect on the large-scale Hubble tension appears to be limited, as the distribution of galaxies hosting SNeIa, both used as calibrators to constrain $H_0$ and in the Hubble-flow, does not show a strong correlation with the dipole signal.",

Limiting Reduction and Modified Gravity, The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is a framework of theories that adjust Newton's laws of gravity to explain effects such as galactic rotation anomalies, offering an alternative to dark matter. This essay examines the justification of MOND by assessing its inter-theoretical relationship to established theories across relevant scales, in particular its connection to Newtonian gravitation. We argue that MOND fails a key condition for a theory's justification--what we call 'reduction-wise justification'--since it does not adequately reduce to Newtonian gravity in a fully non-arbitrary way. More precisely, despite satisfying the standard formal criteria for successful limiting reduction, MOND does not properly reduce to Newtonian gravitation because of (i) the absence of a fundamental theoretical framework to justify the interpolating function introduced in MOND and (ii) the lack of a unified mathematical structure working across all scales, independent of Newtonian theory. Hence, the case study of MOND provides crucial results for the general debate on inter-theoretic reduction in science: MOND's failure as a case of reduction highlights important limitations in standard accounts of limiting reduction. We respond by proposing a more refined framework for limiting reduction that introduces two additional criteria to better distinguish successful from pathological reductions. More broadly, this case illustrates how analysing reduction-wise justification can serve as a powerful tool for evaluating the validity of novel theories that are not yet empirically established.",

Aguilera-Miret Accepted for publication in A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) The magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is widely believed to play a central role in generating large-scale, poloidal magnetic fields during binary neutron star mergers. However, the few simulations that begin with a weak seed magnetic field and capture its growth until saturation predominantly show the effects of small-scale turbulence and winding, but lack convincing evidence of MRI activity. In this work, we investigate how the MRI is affected by the complex magnetic field topologies characteristic of the post-merger phase, aiming to assess the actual feasibility of MRI in such environments. We first derive the MRI instability criterion, as well as expressions for the characteristic wavelength and growth timescale of the fastest-growing modes, under conditions that include significant magnetic field gradients. Our analysis reveals that strong radial magnetic field gradients can impact significantly on the MRI, slowing its growth or suppressing it entirely if large enough. We then apply this extended framework to both idealized analytical disk models and data from a numerical relativity simulation of a long-lived neutron star merger remnant. We find that conditions favourable to MRI growth on astrophysically relevant timescales may occur only in limited regions of the post-merger disk, and only at late times $t\\gtrsim 100$ ms after the merger. These results suggest that the MRI plays a limited role in amplifying poloidal magnetic fields in post-merger environments during the first $\\mathcal{O}(100)$ms.",

Here we investigate in detail the effect that the nature of these parametrisations can have, finding significant effects on the resulting cosmological dark energy constraints. In order to observationally distinguish well-motivated and physical parametrisations from unphysical ones, it is crucial to understand the theoretical priors that physical parametrisations place on the phenomenology of dark energy. To this end we discuss a range of theoretical priors that can be imposed on general dark energy parametrisations, and their effect on the constraints on the phenomenology of dynamical dark energy. More specifically, we investigate both the phenomenological $\\{\\mu,\\Sigma\\}$ parametrisation as well as effective field theory (EFT) inspired approaches to model dark energy interactions. We compare the constraints obtained in both approaches for different phenomenological and theory-informed time-dependences for the underlying functional degrees of freedom, discuss the effects of priors derived from gravitational wave physics, and investigate the interplay between constraints on parameters constraining only the background evolution vs. parameters controlling linear perturbations.",

Gnedin Submitted to OJA, comments are welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The \"Reduced Speed of Light\" (RSL) approximation is commonly used to speed up radiative transfer calculations in cosmological simulations. However, it has been shown previously that the RSL approximation leads to photon non-conservation in some regimes. I show that these missing photons can be counted exactly for some numerical schemes. Adding them back into a simulation, however, is a much harder task. I show one example of such a scheme, which achieves sub-percent accuracy on simple tests. Unfortunately, the scheme performs much worse on semi-realistic simulations of cosmic reionization, leading to a faster overlap and significant errors in the point-to-point comparison of the RSL radiation field with the reference simulation that maintains the full speed of light for the radiative transfer.",

Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We provide a new measurement of the expansion history of the Universe at $z=0.54$ with the cosmic chronometers (CC) method, exploiting the high-quality spectroscopic VLT/MUSE data for three galaxy clusters in close-by redshift bins: SDSS J2222+2745 ($z=0.49$), MACS J1149.5+2223 ($z=0.54$), and SDSS J1029+2623 ($z=0.59$). The central one, MACS J1149.5+2223, hosts the well-known supernova 'Refsdal', which allowed for $H_0$ measurements via time delay cosmography (TDC). This represents the first step for a self-consistent probe combination, where different methods are applied to the same data sample. After selecting the most passive and massive cluster members (38 CCs), we derive their age and physical parameters via full spectrum fitting. We use the code Bagpipes, specifically modified to remove the cosmological prior on ages. On average, the CC sample shows super-solar metallicities $Z/Z_{\\odot} = 1.3 \\pm 0.7$, low dust extinction $A_{\\rm{V}} = 0.3 \\pm 0.3$ mag and to have formed in short bursts $\\tau = 0.6 \\pm 0.2$ Gyr. We also observe both an ageing trend in redshift and a mass-downsizing pattern. From the age-redshift trend, implementing the CC method through a bootstrap approach, we derive a new $H(z)$ measurement: $H$($z$=0.542) = $66_{-29}^{+81}$ (stat) $\\pm$13 (syst) km/s/Mpc. We also simulate the impact of increased statistics and extended redshift coverage, finding that $H$($z$) uncertainties can be reduced by up to a factor of 4 with $\\sim$100 CCs and a slightly broader redshift range (d$z\\sim$0.2).",

González Hernández, Andrea Pastorello 28 pages, 19 Figures and 19 Tables (submitted to ApJ). Comments are welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We have applied our approach of using ''SNe Ia twins''in the Hubble flow to obtain distances to SNe Ia at z $>$ 0.015 and derive H$_{0}$. Our results, taking a single step between the low z domain and the Hubble flow, validate the three rung classical method. We find, however, that the full compilation of distances, both in Pantheon+ and in the Carnegie-Chicago Hubble Program (CCHP), contain some inaccurate values in the colors due to an underestimate of reddening by dust. This produces odd individual values for H$_{0}$ from single SNe Ia. On the average, those erroneous estimates do not affect the mean value of H$_{0}$, which is characterized by the bulk of well--modeled SNe Ia. Our sample of carefully addressed SNe Ia in the Hubble flow contains a dozen supernovae, for which the distances are determined with high accuracy. Three of these SNe Ia are of the Broad Line subtype and can be compared with SN 1989B in M66, a host galaxy with a unique convergence of the Cepheid distance determination and the Tip of the Red Giant Branch stars (TRGB) determination by the CCHP group. They point to a weighted average of H$_{0}$ $=$ 73.556 $\\pm$ 2.084 (stat) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc $^{-1}$. There is as well a very good agreement on the distances to NGC 7250 and NGC 5643 between those derived with Cepheids by SH0ES and those derived with the use of J-Asymptotic Giant Branch stars (JAGB stars) by the CCHP, which makes them very good anchors.

The inferred gas profiles are more extended and the power suppression is stronger than predicted by the fiducial models of recent hydrodynamical simulation suites, including FLAMINGO and BAHAMAS. The HSC-XXL gas mass fractions, which the fiducial simulations were calibrated to reproduce, prefer more moderate power suppression than the kSZ and eROSITA data: $5 \\pm 4\\%$ at $k=1~h~\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. With a simulated LSST Year 1 weak lensing analysis, we demonstrate a framework for next-generation surveys: calibrating feedback models with multi-wavelength gas observables to recover the small-scale statistical power of cosmic shear.",

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have become an indispensable tool for studying the Universe's ionisation properties, as well as its cosmological parameters. This is achieved by analysing their diffuse dispersion measure (${\\rm DM}_{\\rm diff}$) as a function of redshift. However, this requires an integration along the line-of-sight, which is time-consuming. In this work, we derive an analytical approximation formula for ${\\rm DM}_{\\rm diff}$ for flat, $\\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM universes. We show that our approximation works well for the ranges $0.01 \\leq z \\leq 2$, $0.2 \\leq \\Omega_m \\leq 1.0$ and $-3.0 \\leq w \\leq -0.5$, with relative fractional error to a numerically evaluated ${\\rm DM}_{\\rm diff}$ always smaller than $3.5\\ \\%$, in the worst case scenario, and in most cases smaller than $0.5\\ \\%$. Moreover, the approximation is more than $15$ ($2$) times faster than the numerical solution of $\\Lambda$CDM ($w$CDM). Therefore, we hope that it could be a useful tool for the FRB community.",

In the literature, a template for star formation rate, which is just a function of redshift, is typically used. In this work, we point out the importance of galaxy stellar mass function which captures the host galaxy information of observed FRBs as well as the redshift evolution of galaxy stellar mass. Using this information, we find that FRB formation efficiency per stellar mass has to be more efficient (by a factor of $\\approx 3$) than previously calculated, in order to reproduce the observed volumetric rate of FRBs at $z=0$. We show that cosmological population studies of FRBs have to include host galaxy information along with its redshift evolution in order to obtain unbiased results. This consideration is also applicable to other transients, e.g. gamma-ray bursts and merging binary black hole events. We show that our approach may open up the possibility to infer the host galaxy stellar mass of merging binary black holes with a detection of few thousand gravitational wave events.",

While numerous FRBs have now been localised to their host galaxies, a distinct class of compact electromagnetic counterpart, a Persistent Radio Source (PRS), has also been identified in some cases. Currently, only three, and possible a fourth repeating FRBs (FRB20121102A, FRB20190417A, FRB20190520B, and FRB20240114A) have confirmed associations with a PRS. Insight into progenitors, local environments, and the evolution of FRBs can be clarified by characterising these PRSs. In this work, we present 2 detected candidate PRSs using MeerKAT radio telescope data and one non-detection (as part of a larger study involving 25 FRB positions). Both FRB20221106 and FRB20181112 were found to have a host galaxy, and whether the detected radio continuum emission comes from the host galaxy or PRS is still an open question. High-resolution observations from a telescope such as e-MERLIN are required to resolve this question. If a compact PRS is detected, this telescope will provide the size, and investigate the flux variability and spectral shape of this compact PRS. Lastly, in the case of FRB220190102, which was observed over two epochs, no radio continuum was detected. However, a flux upper limit is provided for both epochs.",

We perform simulations of ULDM for each spin, starting with different numbers of identical initial solitons and analyse the properties of the resulting haloes after they merge. Our findings reveal that higher spin lead to broader, less dense haloes with more prominent Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) tails, a characteristic that persists regardless of the number of solitons involved. Additionally, we study the process of dynamical heating for these haloes, and find that the heating time-scale for higher spin increases order an of magnitude compared to the spin 0 case. Then, we identify scaling relations that describe the density profile, core-NFW of spin~$s$ ULDM haloes as a function of the number of initial solitons $N_{\\text{sol}}$. These relations allow us to construct equivalent haloes based on average density or total mass, for arbitrarily large $N_{\\text{sol}}$, without having to simulate those systems. We simulate the orbit of an ULDM satellite in a constructed halo treated as an external potential, and find that for host haloes having the same average density, the disruption time of the satellite is as predicted for a uniform sphere regardless of the spin. However, satellites orbiting haloes having the same mass for each spin, result in faster disruption in the case of spin 0, whereas for haloes having the same core size result in faster disruption in the case of spin 2.",

These can be measured with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), respectively. Here, we use recent DESI DR1, Pantheon+, SH0ES and DES-SN5YR data to test this fundamental relation. We employ a parametrised approach and also use model-independent Generic Algorithms (GA), which are a machine learning method where functions evolve loosely based on biological evolution. When we use DESI and Pantheon+ data without Cepheid calibration or big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), there is a $2\\sigma$ violation of the DDR in the parametrised approach. Then, we add high-redshift BBN data and the low-redshift SH0ES Cepheid calibration. This reflects the Hubble tension since both data sets are in tension in the standard cosmological model $\\Lambda$CDM. In this case, we find a significant violation of the DDR in the parametrised case at $6\\sigma$. Replacing the Pantheon+ SNe Ia data by DES-SN5YR, we find similar results. For the model-independent approach, we find no deviation in the uncalibrated case and a small deviation with BBN and Cepheids which remains at 1$\\sigma$. This shows the importance of considering model-independent approaches for the DDR.",

Recent measurements report a hint of isotropic cosmic birefringence, though its origin remains uncertain. The detailed dynamics of ALPs can leave characteristic imprints on the shape of the $EB$ angular power spectrum, which can be exploited to constrain specific models of cosmic birefringence. We first construct a multi-frequency likelihood that incorporates an intrinsic nonzero $EB$ power spectrum. We also show that the likelihood used in previous studies can be further simplified without loss of generality. Using this framework, we simultaneously constrain the ALP model parameters, the instrumental miscalibration angle, and the amplitudes of the $EB$ power spectrum of a Galactic dust foreground model.

Compared to neural-network-based emulators, MomentEmu offers negligible training cost, millisecond-level evaluation, and transparent functional forms. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we develop two emulators: PolyCAMB-$D_\\ell$, which maps six cosmological parameters to the CMB power spectra (TT, EE, BB, TE), and PolyCAMB-peak, which enables a bidirectional mapping between the cosmological parameters and the acoustic peak features of $D_\\ell^{\\rm TT}$. PolyCAMB-$D_\\ell$ achieves sub-percent accuracy over multipoles $\\ell \\leq 4050$, while PolyCAMB-peak also attains comparable precision and produces symbolic forms consistent with known analytical approximations.

Rev. D 112, 123002 (2025) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful cosmological probe, providing a direct tool to unveil the properties of dark matter (DM) on sub-galactic scales. In particular, flux-ratio anomalies in quadruply imaged quasars (\"quads\") can reveal the presence of dark substructure, such that population-level statistics can be used to constrain the particle nature of DM. Current methods, however, rely on globally parametrized models (\"macromodels\") of the lens mass distribution, which impose rigid physical assumptions on the deflection field. Given the high stakes, it is important to develop complementary methods that do not require the assumption of a macromodel. One promising avenue consists of modeling the resolved emission from the quasar host galaxy (lensed arcs) using a local lensing formalism like the Curved Arc Basis (CAB) description. In this paper, we test the ability of CAB models to predict flux ratios from mock imaging data. We find that CAB model-predicted flux ratios accurately reproduce the expected values, with a typical precision of $\\sim 3-5\\%$. While a macromodel-based approach yields smaller uncertainties, as expected, the CAB method permits a more flexible, local description of the deflection field, thus being more robust to angular structure in the main deflector mass profile, in particular avoiding false-positive detections of flux-ratio anomalies that can arise with overly simplistic parametrizations. On the other hand, by injecting individual DM halos near quasar images, we demonstrate that CAB models do not absorb the local lensing perturbations from DM substructure, and can therefore distinguish flux-ratio anomalies caused by DM substructure from other sources of small-scale perturbation. We conclude that CAB models can be used to infer DM properties from flux-ratio anomaly statistics with minimal assumptions, complementing the traditional macromodel based approach.",

Thanks to recent advances in mm-wave detector technologies we can now overcome these limitations, and conduct the first truly volumetric surveys of star-forming galaxies at mm-wavelengths approaching the L* luminosities of typical galaxies, with ~1000 redshift slices spanning most of the Cosmic star-forming volume (z ~ 1--12) with nearly uniform mass and luminosity selection. We describe an instrument concept capable of delivering such surveys with the technologies available today, which can be built and operated on a ground-based mm-wave facility in the near future. Such integral field unit spectrometers can resolve and identify redshifts for up to to 25,000 star-forming galaxies per year even when operated on a 10-m class telescope. On a larger aperture it can do the same faster or probe even deeper.

This paper presents simulations of feedback processes in massive galaxies showing how kinetic, thermal, and magnetic active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback interacts with the CGM under different environmental conditions. We find that in massive galaxies with shallower central gravitational potential and higher CGM pressure (multiphase galaxy; MPG) pure kinetic AGN feedback is most efficient in preventing CGM cooling from becoming catastrophic while maintaining the CGM entropy within the observed range. For the same galaxy, partitioning AGN energy injection into kinetic ($75\\%$) and thermal ($25\\%$) energy results in an entropy bump within $r\\lesssim15$ kpc while also having a larger amount of cold gas extending out to $r\\sim80$ kpc. A magnetohydrodynamic MPG run with seed magnetic field in the CGM (1~$\\mu$G) and partial magnetised AGN feedback ($1\\%$ of total AGN power) also shows a higher entropy (within $r<15$ kpc) and cold gas mass, albeit the cold gas remains constrained within $r\\lesssim30$ kpc. For a similarly massive galaxy with deeper potential well and low CGM pressure (single phase galaxy; SPG) our simulations show that for both hydro and MHD runs with partial thermal AGN energy, the feedback mechanism remains tightly self-regulating with centrally concentrated cooling (within $r<1$ kpc). Our simulations of a similar mass galaxy with a deeper potential well and higher CGM pressure (SPG-Cool) show that our AGN feedback mechanism cannot get rid of the high CGM density and pressure and its long term evolution is similar to the multiphase galaxy.",

Using simulations of high-redshift 158$\\mu$m [CII] and 88$\\mu$m [OIII] LIM signals created by the LIMFAST code, we develop an ILI framework in a case study of learning the physics of early galaxy formation from the auto-power spectra of these lines or their cross-correlation with galaxy surveys. We leverage neural density estimation with normalizing flows to learn the mapping between the simulated power spectra and parameters that characterize the physics governing the star formation efficiency and the $\\dot{\\Sigma}_{\\star}$-$\\Sigma_\\mathrm{g}$ relation of high-redshift galaxies. Our results show that their partially degenerate effects can be unambiguously constrained when combining [CII] with [OIII] measurements to be made by new-generation mm/sub-mm LIM experiments.",

Main changes compared to previous version: Parts of Sects. 5.2, 5.3, and abstract rewritten to emphasise our main results; additional references added Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We derive the Tully-Fisher (TFR, $M_\\ast-V_{\\rm circ,f}$) and Fall (FR, $j_\\ast-M_\\ast$) relations at redshift $z = 0.9$ using a sample of 43 main-sequence disc galaxies with H$\\alpha$ IFU data and JWST/HST imaging. The strength of our analysis lies in the use of state-of-the-art 3D kinematic models to infer galaxy rotation curves, the inclusion and morphological modelling of NIR bands, and the use of SED modelling applied to our photometry measurements to estimate stellar masses. After correcting the inferred H$\\alpha$ velocities for asymmetric drift, we find a TFR of the form $\\log(M_\\ast / M_\\odot) = a \\log(V_{\\rm circ,f} / 150~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}) + b$, with $a=3.82^{+0.55}_{-0.40}$ and $b=10.27^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$, as well as a FR of the form $\\log(j_\\ast / \\mathrm{kpc\\,km\\,s^{-1}}) = a \\log(M_\\ast / 10^{10.5} M_\\odot) + b$, with $a=0.44^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$ and $b=2.86^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$. Compared with their $z=0$ counterparts, we find moderate evolution in the TFR and strong evolution in the FR over the past 8 Gyr. We interpret our findings in the context of the galaxy-to-halo scaling parameters $f_{\\rm M}=M_\\ast/M_{\\rm vir}$ and $f_{\\rm j}=j_\\ast/j_{\\rm vir}$. We infer that $f_{\\rm j}$ shows little redshift evolution and depends very weakly on $M_\\ast$, with typical values around $f_{\\rm j}\\sim0.8$. As for $f_{\\rm M}$, we find it to be higher and less dependent on $M_\\ast$ at $z=0.9$ than at $z=0$. Interpreting our observed $f_{\\rm M}-M_\\ast$ relations within the Cold Dark Matter framework implies necessarily that the galaxy populations at $z=0.9$ and $z=0$ are not the progenitor/descendant of one another. The alternative scenario is that the $z=0.9$ relations are incorrect due to strong selection effects, unidentified systematics, or the possibility that H$\\alpha$ kinematics may not be a reliable dynamical tracer. Such problems would also affect previous studies on the same subject.",

Accurate knowledge of the location and shape of the critical curve will be useful for understanding the nature of highly magnified stellar sources near critical curves and for revealing sub-galactic dark matter structures within the lens. In galaxy-cluster lenses, however, prediction of critical curves can be uncertain due to complexity in global mass modeling. We explore and validate a kinematics-based method for locating the critical curve. This method leverages the continuous line-of-sight velocity profile of the lensed galaxy mapped through integral field spectroscopy of emission lines, and combines an agnostic local lens model and a disk rotation model. Applying our method to a highly magnified region of the Dragon Arc in the Abell 370 cluster lensing field using archival VLT/MUSE IFU mapping of the H$\\beta$ line, we constrain the critical curve to an uncertainty band with a half-width of 0.23\" ($1\\sigma$). This result reveals locations of recently detected extremely magnified stars biased toward the negative-parity side of the critical curve, as predicted for intracluster microlensing. With future JWST/NIRSpec IFU mapping of the H$\\alpha$ line at SNR $\\simeq$ 10 (20), uncertainty could improve to 0.12\" (0.08\"). A measurement of this type with sufficiently small uncertainty may reveal small-scale wiggles in the shape of the critical curve, which can arise from the lensing perturbation of sub-galactic dark matter substructure. Our approach is generally applicable to caustic-crossing giant arcs and can be incorporated into global lens modeling.",

Please see the short video in: this https URL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Identifying the sources of high-energy (TeV-PeV) astrophysical neutrinos is crucial for studies in both astrophysics and particle physics. Despite extensive searches for more than a decade, which revealed several individual potential sources and only one potential source class, the origins of these neutrinos remain largely unresolved; thus, more source classes should be investigated. In this work, we conduct the first search for high-energy neutrino emission from a new source class, supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), which are also theoretically motivated. We perform an unbinned maximum-likelihood-ratio analysis on our constructed catalog of 693 SMBHB candidates and 10 years of IceCube public data. Our results show positive correlations, with higher significance in more physically motivated scenarios and the highest significance at 3.0$\\sigma$. In addition, we also study potential connections between SMBHBs' high-energy neutrino and nano-Hz gravitational-wave emissions, the latter being the main target of pulsar timing arrays. Our results provide the first evidence of SMBHBs being high-energy neutrino emitters.",

Because the plasma in the jet-launching region is accelerated to relativistic velocities, and because the jet in M87 is nearly aligned with the line of sight (offset by ~17 degrees), a slow-light treatment is important for accurately modeling the observable structure. While fast-light images exhibit prominent helical or loop-shaped features in the jet - which we associate with narrow bundles of magnetic field lines - these features become stretched and smoothed-out in slow-light images. Our slow-light images instead exhibit a double-edged, cone-like morphology that is more consistent with observations of M87 than corresponding fast-light images. We find that the radius at which the plasma transitions from sub-relativistic to relativistic velocities is imprinted on slow-light images via a transition from loop-dominated at small distances from the black hole to edge-dominated at a larger distance, with the loop-edge transition occurring at larger distances for lower black hole spins. The jet image dynamics also vary with black hole spin, with low-spin models producing jets that exhibit substantial \"wobbling\", while high-spin models produce jets that are straighter and more stable in time. The spin-dependent jet morphology and variability are revealed by slow-light imaging because slow-light effects become more enhanced as the plasma velocity becomes more relativistic, and because the plasma acceleration is itself a strong function of the spin.",

Dihingia High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) We present global 3D GRMHD simulations of black hole (BH) accretion disks designed to investigate how MRI-driven dynamo action regulates jet formation and evolution. Unlike standard SANE/MAD setups that impose a coherent large-scale poloidal loop, our \"sub-SANE\" initial conditions use multiple same-polarity small-scale magnetic loops. Rapid reconnection erases magnetic memory and enables large-scale dynamo to emerge early from MRI turbulence. We perform two such sub-SANE simulations at different BH spins ($a = 0.5, 0.9375$) and compare them with conventional SANE runs. The sub-SANE disks show regular large-scale dynamo cycles with periods of about ten orbits. Decomposition of the induction equation shows that the turbulent dynamo term is stronger in 3D compared to 2.5D and balances advection in the saturated state, confirming sustained large-scale field generation. These dynamo-generated fields are advected inward with minimal time lag, producing correlated peaks in both poloidal and toroidal field strengths from $r_{\\rm max}$ to the horizon. Early in the evolution, these peaks imprint directly onto the jet's electromagnetic energy flux, indicating that the jet mirrors the dynamo wave. Though jets form at early times, the sub-SANE runs eventually undergo jet shutdown. We show that this occurs when the magnetic field at the horizon loses coherence, as quantified by a decline in the signed-to-unsigned flux ratio $\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm BH}$ below $\\approx 0.6$. In contrast, the SANE reference case with similar accretion rate and horizon magnetic flux maintains high magnetic coherence because its initial large-scale field persists, allowing its jet to survive. Our results show that both dynamo-driven field evolution and horizon magnetic-field coherence critically regulate jet longevity, establishing a direct dynamo-jet connection in GRMHD disks.",

Plotkin, Behzad Tahmazebzadeh (for the COIN collaboration) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) have long been hypothesized as valuable indicators of black holes, offering insight into their demographics and behaviour out to high redshift. TDEs have also enabled the discovery of a few Massive Black Holes (MBHs) with inferred masses of $10^4$--$10^6\\,M_\\odot$, often associated with the nuclei of dwarf galaxies or ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs). Here we present AT2022zod, an extreme and short-lived optical flare in an elliptical galaxy at z=0.11, residing within 3kpc of the galaxy's centre. Its luminosity and ~30-day duration make it unlikely to have originated from the host galaxy's central supermassive black hole (SMBH), which estimate to have a mass around $10^8\\,M_\\odot$. Assuming that the emission mechanism is consistent with known observed TDEs, we find that such a rapidly evolving transient could either be produced by a MBH in the intermediate-mass range or, alternatively, result from the tidal disruption of a star on a non-parabolic orbit around the central SMBH. We suggest that the most plausible origin for AT2022zod is the tidal disruption of a star by a MBH embedded in a UCD. As the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time comes online, we propose that AT2022zod serves as an important event for refining search strategies and characterization techniques for intermediate-mass black holes.",

However, its light curves deviate substantially from previous theoretical expectations. Motivated by these unique features, we have developed a novel model that successfully reproduces its peculiar evolution. Our model delineates five stages: (1) Initial Stage of inefficient circularization; (2) Slow-Rising Stage with a faint X-ray precursor disk fed by successive self-crossings; (3) Fast-Rising Stage, where delayed stream-disk interaction at momentum flux matching drives a sharp luminosity rise; (4) Plateau Stage with super-Eddington accretion, outflow, reprocessing, and a clear polar line-of-sight; and (5) Decline Stage of sub-Eddington accretion and ongoing reprocessing. Our fit indicates the disruption of a $M_* \\approx 0.4~M_\\odot$ main-sequence (MS) star with a penetration factor $\\beta \\approx 1.0$. Our model, which incorporates key TDE processes, establishes EP240222a-like light curves as typical IMBH-TDE signatures. The distinctive identifier is a slow rise in X-rays and a corresponding slow rise/quasi-plateau in the UV/optical, followed by a brighter, super-Eddington plateau in both bands, though other forms exist, such as the rapid rise from white dwarf (WD) disruptions over minutes to days.",

However, despite the effort of intensive radio search for decades, none of these binaries has been found to date. These binaries are regarded as a holy grail of astronomy because they can greatly improve our understanding about relativistic systems of compact objects and fundamental physics. In this article, we propose the existence of exotic BH-NS binaries which can open a new way in searching the missing BH-NS binaries in our Galaxy. By considering the possible dark matter density spikes formed around the primordial black holes in the BH-NS binaries, we show that extremely high temperature ($\\sim 10^6$ K) could be maintained on the surface of the neutron stars due to effective dark matter capture. This interesting feature can also help reveal the nature of dark matter and possibly further improve the upper limit of dark matter scattering cross section well below $10^{-47}$ cm$^2$.",

High Energy Astrophysics in Southern Africa (HEASA 2025), 16-20 September 2025 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) has recently reported five Galactic microquasars as Ultra-High-Energy (UHE) $\\gamma$-ray emitters (> 100 TeV). Among these sources, the microquasar V4641 Sgr exhibits $\\gamma$-ray emission up to $\\sim$0.8 PeV, requiring the acceleration of particles to multi-PeV energies, as well as the hardest UHE spectrum. The mechanisms behind particle acceleration to such energies are not well understood. Furthermore, the limited multi-wavelength (MWL) information on this source appears contradictory, further complicating interpretation and suggesting that V4641 Sgr may represent a particularly unusual case. In this work, we present a detailed physical model of V4641 Sgr that combines first-principles simulations of stochastic (turbulent) particle acceleration with MWL emission modeling. We adopt a leptonic scenario in which electrons are accelerated via the second-order Fermi process driven by relativistic strong turbulence ($\\delta B/B \\sim 1$). The particle energization is simulated using a dedicated Monte Carlo framework STRIPE that incorporates the effects of intermittent energy gains and radiative losses. The resulting accelerated electrons produce UHE $\\gamma$-rays through inverse Compton scattering on both the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the interstellar radiation fields (ISRF). Our model is capable of reproducing key observational characteristics of the system, including particle acceleration to energies of tens of PeV, as well as the TeV-PeV $\\gamma$-ray spectrum and the hard spectral index measured by LHAASO. Nonetheless, several aspects remain unresolved, highlighting the need for deeper observational coverage and further theoretical refinement.",

They are mostly of extragalactic origin, but the progenitors, trigger mechanisms and radiation processes are still largely unknown. Here we present a comprehensive analysis on 415 non-repeating FRBs detected by CHIME, applying manual filtering to ensure sample completeness. It is found that the distribution of fluence can be approximated by a three-segment power-law function, with the power-law indices being $-3.76 \\pm 1.61$, $0.20 \\pm 0.68$ and $2.06 \\pm 0.90$ in the low, middle, and high fluence segments, respectively. Both the total dispersion measure (\\text{DM}) and the extragalactic \\text{DM} follow a smoothly broken power-law distribution, with characteristic break DM values of $\\sim 703$ pc $\\rm cm^{-3}$ and $\\sim 639$ pc $\\rm cm^{-3}$, respectively. The redshifts are estimated from the extragalactic \\text{DM} by using the Macquart relation, which are found to peak at $ z \\sim 0.6$. The isotropic energy release ($E_{\\text{iso}}$) is also derived for each burst. Two-Gaussian components are revealed in the distribution of $E_{\\text{iso}}$, with the major population narrowly clustered at $\\sim 2.3 \\times 10^{40} {\\rm erg}$. The minor population have a characteristic energy of $\\sim 1.6 \\times 10^{39}$ erg and span approximately one order of magnitude. The distribution hints a near-uniform energy release mechanism for the dominant population as expected from some catastrophic channels, whereas the lower-energy component (potentially including repeat-capable sources) may reflect a broader diversity in FRB origins, emission mechanisms and evolutionary stages.",

A total of 232 sources have been selected from the 3HSP catalogue and targeted in the analysis of KM3NeT/ARCA data taken with several detector configurations, specifically in the period in which from 6 to 21 detection units were deployed.

      "abstract": "VHE FSRQs with Fermi-LAT: VHE and even brighter states in high-z FSRQs due to an HBL-like component? Megha, Pankaj Kushwaha High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Very high-energy (VHE) detected flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) are relatively few despite being the most persistent bright MeV-GeV sources. Focusing on VHE emission, we investigated the spectral and temporal properties of VHE-detected FSRQs using 14-year Fermi-LAT data. All are highly variable (flux-amplitude$>$100) with VHE detection associated with brighter flux states and relatively harder spectra. Above a flux limit, flux anti-correlates with spectral index, exhibiting a bluer-when-brighter trend. The low-flux state spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for all resembles a power-law, while high-flux and VHE-associated states resemble a log-parabola, accompanied by an almost nil (PKS0736+017, PKS1510-089) to marginal (4C+21.35, 3C279) to significant (B21420+32, TON0599, PKS1441+25, S30218+35, PKS0346-27, OP313) MeV-GeV peak-upshift -- more prominent in high-redshift sources. For no/marginal peak-upshift, the VHE emission is consistent with external Comptonization of infrared photons (EC-IR) driven primarily by a power-law continuation of the particle spectrum to higher energies. For those with a significant MeV-GeV peak-upshift, PKS0346-27 and OP313 shows peak-upshift in the synchrotron spectrum, and thus VHE is EC-IR origin, while for others without synchrotron-peak upshift, we attribute the VHE to an HBL-like component with a Compton-Dominance (CD) like FSRQs, with VHE driven primarily by particle spectrum continuation. In some, even high-state SEDs seem to require an HBL-like component. Thus, VHE activities in FSRQs mainly result from particle spectrum continuation, aided by spectral transition or a new HBL-like component with FSRQ-like CD. Such spectral changes naturally brighten the GeV-VHE flux, overcoming extragalactic background light absorption without requiring extraordinary brightening under the traditional EC-IR scenario than normally exhibited.",

Submitted to Memorie della Società Astronomica Italiana (MemSAIt). Presented at the 8th Heidelberg International Symposium on High-Energy Gamma-Ray Astronomy (Gamma-2024), 2024 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) is the accumulated light emitted throughout the history of the universe, spanning the UV, optical, and IR spectral ranges. Stars and dust in galaxies are expected to be the main source of the EBL. However, recent direct measurements performed beyond Pluto's orbit (less affected by foregrounds than those performed from the Earth) hint at an EBL level in the optical band larger than the one expected from the integrated contribution of known galaxy populations. One approach that could solve this controversy uses Very High Energy (VHE) photons coming from sources at cosmological distances. These photons can interact with the EBL producing electron-positron pairs, a process that leaves an imprint on the observed VHE spectrum. This technique, however, requires assumptions on the intrinsic spectrum of the source, which can compromise the robustness of EBL constraints. In this contribution, we used Monte Carlo simulations and archival data of the MAGIC telescopes to study the impact that the assumptions adopted in the literature have on the estimate of the EBL density, and how using more generic ones would modify the results. Our results show how the EBL density constraints obtained highly depend on the intrinsic spectral shape assumed for the source. We have studied two different methods to reduce the assumptions on the intrinsic spectral shape to get more robust results. This will be especially important for upcoming with new VHE facilities, where systematic uncertainties are expected to play a more significant role compared to statistical ones.",

In this study, we analyze GRB 230204B, an exceptionally energetic and multi-pulsed long GRB, detected by the Fermi GBM and MAXI detectors, with an isotropic equivalent gamma-ray energy exceeding 10$^{54}$ erg. Time-resolved spectral analysis reveals a transition in the prompt emission from hard (sub-photospheric dominated) spectra during early pulses to softer (synchrotron radiation dominated) spectra in later pulses, indicative of a hybrid jet composition. We report the discovery and characterization of the optical afterglow using the MASTER and BOOTES robotic telescope networks, which enabled rapid follow-up observations starting at $\\sim$1.3 ks post-burst. The optical luminosity at this time was exceptionally high, surpassing that of many other optically bright GRBs, such as GRB 990123, GRB 080319B, etc. This places the burst among the most luminous optical GRBs observed to date. Long-term radio observations extending to 335 days post-burst were conducted with the ATCA. Multi-wavelength modeling was conducted using an external ISM forward-shock top-hat jet model with \\sw{afterglowpy}. The results reveal a narrow and highly collimated jet with a circumburst density of $n_{0} \\sim$ 28.12 cm$^{-3}$, kinetic energy $E_{\\rm K} \\sim$ 4.18 $\\times 10^{55}$ erg, and a relatively low value of $\\epsilon_{B}$ = 2.14 $\\times 10^{-6}$, indicating shock-compression of magnetic field in the surrounding interstellar medium. We constrained a low radiative efficiency of $\\sim$ 4.3 \\%. This study highlights the indispensable contribution of robotic networks to early afterglow observations and advances our understanding of GRB 230204B unique characteristics and underlying jet physics.",

Spectro-polarimetric observations of exceptionally bright GRBs provide a powerful diagnostic tool to address these challenges. GRB 230307A, the second-brightest long-duration GRB ever detected, exhibits a rare association with a Kilonova, offering a unique and rare probe into the emission processes of GRBs originating from compact object mergers. We present a comprehensive time-averaged and time-resolved spectro-polarimetric analysis of GRB 230307A using joint observations from the $AstroSat$ Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager (CZTI), the $Fermi$ Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and $Konus$-Wind. Spectral analysis reveals a temporal evolution in the low-energy photon index, $\\alpha$, transitioning from a hard to a softer state over the burst duration. Time-averaged polarimetric measurements yield a low polarization fraction ($<$ 12.7 %), whereas time-resolved polarization analysis unveils a marked increase in polarization fractions ($>$ 49 %) in the later stages of the emission episode. This spectro-polarimetric evolution suggests a transition in the dominant radiative mechanism: the initial phase, possibly characterized by thermal-dominated photospheric emission (unpolarized or weakly polarized), gives way to a regime dominated by non-thermal synchrotron emission (highly polarized). This transition provides possible evidence for the evolving influence of magnetic fields in shaping the GRB emission process and jet dynamics.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Recently, polarization angle (PA) orthogonal jumps over millisecond timescales were discovered from three bursts of a repeating fast radio burst source FRB 20201124A by the FAST telescope. In general, PA jumps can arise from the coherent or incoherent superposition of two electromagnetic waves, with total polarization fraction remains constant in the former and not in the latter. The observations seem to be more consistent with incoherent superposition. The amplitudes of the two orthogonal modes are required to be comparable when jumps occur. We provide general constraints on FRB emission and propagation mechanisms based on the data. Physically, it is difficult to produce PA jumps through switching the dominance of the two orthogonal modes within millisecond timescales, and a geometric effect due to the source rotation is more plausible. This requires that the emission region be within the magnetosphere of a spinning central engine, likely a magnetar. The two orthogonal modes in different directions can arise when the source rotation brings two independent emission regions with different dominant modes successively into the line-of-sight, either due to intrinsic radiation mechanisms or the O-mode undergoing a delayed transparency because of the Alfvén-O-mode conversion. Splitting of emission directions for the two modes due to plasma birefringence is not easy to achieve when the plasma is moving relativistically. For intrinsic radiation mechanisms, curvature radiation always predicts $|E_{\\rm X}/E_{\\rm O}|\\gtrsim1$, and is difficult to produce jumps; whereas inverse Compton scattering can achieve the conversion amplitude ratio $|E_{\\rm X}/E_{\\rm O}|=1$ to allow jumps to occur under special geometric configurations.",

Dihingia, Akhil Uniyal, Yosuke Mizuno 15 pages, 11 Figures, Accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Theoretical models have long predicted the existence of shocks in multi-transonic accretion flows onto a black hole, yet their fate under realistic general relativistic simulations has not been fully tested. In this study, we present results from high-resolution two-dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamic (GRHD) and general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of low-angular-momentum accretion flows onto Kerr black holes, focusing on the formation of shocks in transonic accretion flow. We demonstrate that for specific combinations of energy and angular momentum, global shock solutions naturally emerge between multiple sonic points. These shocks are sustained in both corotating and counter-rotating cases, and their locations depend on specific energy, angular momentum, and the spin of the black hole which is in good agreement with analytical solutions. In magnetized flows, weak magnetic fields preserve the shock structure, whereas strong fields suppress it, enhancing turbulence and driving powerful, magnetically dominated jets/outflows. The strength and structure of the outflow also depend on a black hole spin and magnetization, with higher black hole spin parameters leading to faster jets. Shock solutions are found only in super-Alfvénic regions, where kinetic forces dominate. Our findings provide important insights into the physics of hot corona formation and jet launching in low-angular-momentum accretion systems such as Sgr~A$^*$ (weak jet/outflow) and X-ray binaries.",

In this paper, we present multi-band photometric and spectroscopic observations spanning $\\sim$100 days post-discovery. Its multi-band light curves display {multiple} distinct peaks: (1) an initial peak at $t \\approx 1.6$ days attributed to shock cooling emission, (2) a secondary peak of $M_{R, \\, peak} \\approx$ $-$15.8 mag at $t \\approx 10.2$ days powered by radioactive decay, and (3) a {possible} late-time bump at $t \\approx 42.8$ days likely caused by ejecta-circumstellar material/clump interaction. Spectral evolution of SN 2025coe reveals a fast transition to the nebular phase within 2 months, where it exhibits an exceptionally high [Ca II]/[O I] ratio larger than 6. Modeling of the bolometric light curve suggests an ejecta mass of $M_{\\rm ej} = 0.29^{+0.14}_{-0.15} \\, M_{\\odot}$, a $^{56}$Ni mass of $M_{\\rm ^{56}Ni} = 2.4^{+0.06}_{-0.05} \\times 10^{-2} M_{\\odot}$, and a progenitor envelope with mass $M_e = 1.4^{+6.9}_{-1.2} \\times 10^{-3} \\, M_{\\odot}$ and radius $R_e = 13.5^{+64.1}_{-11.1} \\, R_{\\odot}$. The tidal disruption of a hybrid HeCO white dwarf (WD) by a low-mass CO WD provides a natural explanation for the low ejecta mass, the small fraction of $^{56}$Ni, and the presence of an extended, low-mass envelope.",

Gelfand, Samayra Straal 22 pages, 14 Figures, 7 Tables, Accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Magnetars are the leading candidate sources of fast radio bursts (FRBs). However, the observational probes of the connections between magnetars and FRBs are severely limited by the paucity of detection of highly energetic radio events from magnetars -- to date, only one radio burst as energetic as FRBs has been detected from a Galactic magnetar. Here, we present a detailed analysis of a large sample of low-energy bursts detected from the magnetar XTE J1810$-$197, and probe their implications for FRB emission from magnetars. We report detection of over 97000 bright radio pulses from 242 observations of the magnetar XTE J1810$-$197 over 4.5 years and two decades in frequency (300 MHz to 6.15 GHz), using the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope and the Green Bank Telescope, after its recent outburst onset in December 2018. We present detailed analysis of the burst fluence distributions and their trends with time as well as frequency, and the waiting time distribution. We show that XTE J1810$-$197 rapidly switches between pulsar-like and giant-pulse-like emission states, and magnetars like XTE J1810$-$197 remain viable and likely emitters of FRBs, in the form of giant-pulses with energies comparable to FRBs. We also demonstrate that the lack of the detection of an underlying periodicity in the bursts from repeating FRBs might be caused by emission across a wide range of spin phases.",

Valerin 14 pages, 16 figures, 2 tables, 2 appendices, accepted by A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present late-time optical and infrared (IR) observations of a sample of nine extragalactic luminous red novae (LRNe) discovered in the past three decades. In all of these cases, the LRN survivors fade below the pre-outburst luminosity of the progenitors in the optical region. However, they remain visible in the near-IR (NIR) and bright in the mid-IR (MIR) domains for years. We recover AT 1997bs in Spitzer images from 2004, and a residual source is visible in HST and JWST NIR images 27 years after the outburst. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of AT 1997bs is consistent with that of an orange giant star with a photospheric temperature of 3750-4250 K and a radius of 120-150 $R_{\\odot}$, without a significant circumstellar dust attenuation. Similarly, the SED of AT 2019zhd after three years is compatible with a red supergiant star with $T_{ph}=3100\\pm100$ K and $R=350\\pm50$ $R_{\\odot}$. Another LRN, AT 2011kp, is detected by JWST 12.5 years after the outburst. Its SED, with two excesses at 1.8 and 7.7 $\\mu$m, can be explained by a cold ($T\\sim450$ K) dusty shell composed of amorphous carbon surrounding a cold expanded source, plus emission from the Pa$\\alpha$ line. We constructed the [3.6]-[4.5] colour curves extending up to more than 7 years for six LRNe, which show a similar evolution: The MIR colour is $\\sim-0.5$ mag before the optical maximum light, it becomes bluer after around one year, and then it gradually turns to redder colours before reaching $\\sim+1.0$ mag after 7 years. We also estimated the masses and the temperatures of newly formed dust years after the LRN onset. We find that LRNe produce dust masses of the order of (1-5)x$10^{-4}$ (and up to 2x$10^{-3}$) $M_{\\odot}$ between 7 and 13 years after the outbursts. Finally, we find that the remnants of LRNe detected years or decades after the merger are expanded and cool objects, similar to red supergiant stars.",

Additional UV/optical line measurements (e.g., Ly$\\alpha$, Si IV, C IV) come from complementary COSMOS-field spectroscopy. Both sources are robustly detected in the mid-infrared, with detections in MIRI F1000W for both AGNs and an additional detection in MIRI F2100W for cid_414, indicating the presence of hot dust emission. The source cid_947 shows a higher He I$\\lambda$10830 absorption column density and X-ray-inferred $N_{\\rm H}$, and displays strong outflow signatures in He I, Si IV, and C IV with velocity offsets exceeding 5000 km/s. The source cid_414 shows a narrow Ly$\\alpha$ emission line with luminosity $\\log L_{\\rm Ly\\alpha}=42.49\\pm0.01~\\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$ and a higher intrinsic 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity. Host-galaxy decomposition and multi-component SED fitting indicate that cid_947 hosts a more massive black hole but lower star formation rate than cid_414. From simplified photoionization modeling, we infer that the dense absorbing gas has a characteristic size comparable to the nuclear broad-line region and is likely kinematically coupled to the obscuration associated with the dust torus. He I$\\lambda$1083 absorption has also been identified in several compact little red dots at similar redshifts. Together with the two AGNs reported here, these findings suggest that dense circumnuclear gas are plausibly prevalent at high redshift and plays an important role in regulating AGN obscuration and black hole--host co-evolution.",

Utilizing the TNG galaxy-formation model, the DREAMS simulations incorporate both baryonic physics and cosmological uncertainties for a large sample of galaxies with diverse environments and formation histories. We investigate the relative impact of the physical uncertainty from the galaxy-formation model on predicted satellite properties using four metrics: the satellite stellar mass function, radial distribution, inner slope of dark matter density profile, and stellar half-light radius. We compare these predictions to observations from the SAGA Survey and the DREAMS N-body simulations and find that uncertainties from baryonic physics modeling are subdominant to the scatter arising from halo-to-halo variance. Where baryonic modeling does affect satellites, the supernova wind energy has the largest effect on the satellite properties that we investigate. Specifically, increased supernova wind energy suppresses the stellar mass of satellites and results in more extended stellar half-light radii. The adopted wind speed has only a minor impact, and other astrophysical and cosmological parameters show no measurable effect. Our findings highlight the robustness of satellite properties against uncertainties in baryonic physics modeling.",

These so-called \"little red dots\" (LRDs) often exhibit broad Balmer emission lines, indicative of the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). They generally lack detection of X-ray, radio, and mid-IR radiation, which is fundamentally different from typical AGNs. Various models, including super-Eddington-accreting black holes enshrouded in dense and dust-poor gas, have been proposed to explain these features. However, the nature of LRDs remains debated, and their evolutionary fate is unclear. Here we report two unusual LRDs at redshift z = 2.868 and 2.925 that are in a transitional phase towards typical AGNs. Their V-shaped SEDs, compact optical morphology, and broad emission lines satisfy the defining criteria of LRDs. On the other hand, they exhibit intense X-ray, radio, and mid-IR radiation that is much stronger than previously known LRDs. These hybrid properties suggest that the dense gas envelope around their central black holes is dispersing, allowing high-energy photons and radio emission to escape. Meanwhile, a dust torus is forming. This finding provides a direct insight into the nature of LRDs and indicates that at least some LRDs will evolve into AGNs or quasars at later times.",

The tool models galaxy components such as disks, bulges, and spiral arms using Sérsic profiles, and it populates them with stellar clumps whose properties are sampled from physically motivated distributions. ClumPyLen includes the effects of gravitational lensing through user-provided deflection angle maps and simulates realistic observational conditions by accounting for instrumental effects, Point-Spread-Function convolution, sky background, and photon noise. The simulator can support a wide range of filters and instruments; here we focus on HST/ACS, HST/WFC3-IR, and JWST/NIRCam. We demonstrate the capabilities of the code through two examples, including a detailed simulation of the z = 6.145 source Cosmic Archipelago lensed by MACS J0416.1-2403. The simulated images closely match the morphology and limiting magnitudes of real observations. ClumPyLen is designed to explore the detectability of stellar clumps in terms of mass and size, especially in the low-mass regime, and it allows the study of clump blending effects. Thanks to its modular design, the code is highly adaptable to a wide range of scientific goals, including lensing studies, galaxy evolution, and the generation of synthetic datasets for machine learning or forward modeling applications.",

We present a new variant of the \"Deep Potential\" method of determining the gravitational potential from a snapshot of stellar positions and velocities that does not require any modeling of spatial selection functions. Instead of modeling the full six-dimensional phase-space distribution function $f\\left(\\vec{x},\\vec{v}\\right)$ of observed kinematic tracers, we model the conditional velocity distribution $p\\left(\\vec{v}\\mid\\vec{x}\\right)$, which is unaffected by a purely spatial selection function. We simultaneously learn the gravitational potential $\\Phi\\left(\\vec{x}\\right)$ and the underlying spatial density of the entire tracer population $n\\left(\\vec{x}\\right)$ - including unobserved stars - using the collisionless Boltzmann equation under the stationarity assumption. The advantage of this method is that unlike the spatial selection function, all of the quantities we model, $p\\left(\\vec{v}\\mid\\vec{x}\\right)$, $\\Phi\\left(\\vec{x}\\right)$, and $n\\left(\\vec{x}\\right)$, typically vary smoothly in both position and velocity. We demonstrate that this \"conditional\" Deep Potential method is able to accurately recover the gravitational potential in a mock dataset with a complex three-dimensional dust distribution that imprints fine angular structure on the selection function. Because we do not need to model the spatial selection function, our new method can effectively scale to large, complex datasets while using relatively few parameters, and is thus well suited to Gaia data.",

Windhorst 11 pages, 4 figures; to be submitted Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We report the discovery of a doubly-imaged Little Red Dot (LRD) candidate behind the galaxy cluster Abell 383, which we dub A383-LRD1. Initially classified as a dropout galaxy in HST imaging with several ground-based emission line detections placing it at $z_{\\mathrm{spec}}=6.027$, new JWST/NIRCam observations taken as part of the cycle 4 VENUS survey now reveal that the source consists of two underlying components: A red point-source with a V-shaped SED consistent with LRD selection criteria, and a nearby ($\\sim 380$ pc) compact blue companion which was the main contributor to the previous rest-frame UV detections. Based on lensing symmetry and its SED, the LRD appears to lie at a similar redshift as well. The magnification of the two images of A383-LRD1 is $\\mu_{\\mathrm{A}}=16.2\\pm1.2$ and $\\mu_\\mathrm{B}=9.0\\pm0.6$, respectively, and the predicted time delay between them is $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{grav}}=5.20\\pm0.14$ yr ($\\sim0.7$ yr in the rest-frame). After correcting for the lensing magnification, we derive an absolute magnitude of $M_{\\mathrm{UV,LRD}}=-16.8\\pm 0.3$ for the LRD, and $M_{\\mathrm{UV,BC}}=-18.2\\pm 0.2$ for the blue companion. We perform SED fits to both components, revealing the LRD to be best fitted with a black hole star (BH*) model and a substantial host galaxy, and the blue companion with an extremely young, emission-line dominated star-forming nebula. A383-LRD1 represents the second known multiply-imaged LRD detected to date, following A2744-QSO1, and to our knowledge, the first LRD system with a confirmed detection of [C $_{II}$]$\\lambda158 \\ \\mu$m emission from ALMA observations. Thanks to lensing magnification, this system opens a unique door to study the relation between a LRD, its host galaxy, and its environment, and represents a prime candidate for deep JWST spectroscopy and high-resolution ALMA follow-up observations.",

Prabhu, Kristine Spekkens, Dennis Zaritsky 16 pages, 6 figures, submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We report on four Local Volume dwarf galaxies identified through our ongoing SEmi-Automated Machine LEarning Search for Semi-resolved galaxies (SEAMLESS): Hydrus A, LEDA 486718, Cetus B, and Sculptor 26, with the discovery of Hydrus A reported here for the first time. These four galaxies span a wide range of environments and evolutionary states. Hydrus A (MV = -9.39+/-0.20, D = 3.38-0.30+0.32 Mpc) and LEDA 486718 (MV = -11.62+/-0.08, D = 4.80+/-0.17 Mpc) are among the most isolated dwarfs known within 5 Mpc, while Cetus B (MV = -8.26+/-0.17, D = 3.32-0.23+0.25 Mpc) and Sculptor 26 (MV = -11.25+/-0.10, D =3.21+/-0.13 Mpc) lie < 2 Rvir of NGC 253. Hydrus A shows properties consistent with quenching driven by cosmic reionization, cosmic-web interactions, or internal feedback. LEDA 486718 is an isolated star forming dwarf. Cetus B appears quenched and morphologically disturbed, making it a low-mass satellite or backsplash candidate, while Sculptor 26 is red and seemingly gas-poor but displays signs of recent activity, consistent with a transitional evolutionary state. Together, these systems demonstrate the power of SEAMLESS for building a census of faint galaxies beyond the Local Group.",

Petr-Gotzens, Stefan Meingast, João Alves, Emmanuel Bertin, Hervé Bouy, Martin Piecka, Sebastian Ratzenböck, Andrea Socci 19 pages, 19 figures, 3 tables. Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The most recently formed young stellar objects (YSOs) in active star forming regions are excellent tracers of their parent cloud motion. Their positions and dynamics provide insight into cluster formation and constrain kinematic decoupling timescales between stars and gas. However, because of their strong extinction and young age, embedded YSOs are mainly visible at infrared wavelengths and thus absent from astrometric surveys such as Gaia. We measured the proper motions of 6,769 sources toward the NGC 2024 cluster in the Flame Nebula using multi-epoch near-infrared observations from three ESO public surveys: VISIONS, VHS, and the VISTA/VIRCAM science verification program. Cross-validation of our results with Gaia using optically visible stars shows excellent agreement, with uncertainties on the same order of magnitude. For 362 YSO candidates identified from the literature, we derived proper motions on the order of <5 mas/yr with mean measurement uncertainties of ~0.22 mas/yr. This is the first homogeneous proper motion measurement of this quality for more than half of these stars. For Class I and flat-spectrum sources, our results provide a >13-fold increase in available proper motion measurements. We analyzed the positional and kinematic differences between YSO classes and confirmed a previously reported inside-out age segregation from younger to older stars, likely driven by an outward movement of older stars. No evidence of prolonged hierarchical assembly was found. Instead, the results support a rapid (<1 Myr) cluster collapse. This scenario also accounts for the observed slightly higher 1D velocity dispersion of Class I sources relative to Class flat objects. YSO radial velocities generally align with the gas velocities measured from 12CO(3-2), HNC(1-0), HCN(1-0), and show a weaker correlation with N_2H+(1-0). Some Class II and III objects appear to be already decoupling.",

The stellar spectroscopic survey GALAH's unique wavelength range and setup include the Eu absorption feature at $\\sim6645$ Å for almost a million stars in the most recent Data Release 4 (DR4). However, DR4 also saw a decreased precision in reported Eu measurements compared to previous data releases. In this work, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform label transfer, wherein we use the GALAH DR4 spectra and stellar parameters to infer DR3 [Eu/H] abundances. This CNN is then applied to DR4 spectra without corresponding DR3 Eu abundances to develop a new, publicly available catalogue of [Eu/H] values for high signal-to-noise targets. We include [Eu/H] predictions for $118\\,946$ stars, out of which $54\\,068$ giants constitute our \"golden sample\" of high-confidence predictions, which pass stricter quality cuts and have a reported precision $\\lesssim0.1$. To overcome the scarcity of training data in the low metallicity regime, we provide an additional catalogue of [Eu/H] abundances for metal poor ($\\mathrm{[Fe/H]}<-1$) stars derived from synthesis of the Eu feature. Our \"golden sample\" can be combined with [Eu/H] values from GALAH DR3 to create a catalogue of over $100\\,000$ vetted, high-quality abundances on a homogeneous scale. Moreover, we are able to reproduce known science results, including the elevated Eu abundances of accreted stars and previously observed Galactic chemical evolution trends. This catalogue represents one of the largest available samples of [Eu/H] abundances for high signal-to-noise targets.",

Helly 11 pages, 3 figures, submitted to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We use the FLAMINGO galaxy formation model to quantify the impact of baryon-CDM isocurvature perturbations on galaxy formation in $\\Lambda$CDM. In linear theory, these perturbations represent local, compensated variations in the ratio between the baryon and CDM densities; they freeze in amplitude at late times, with an RMS amplitude of $1.5\\%$ on the Lagrangian scale of a $10^{11}\\,\\rm M_\\odot$ halo ($0.85\\, \\rm{Mpc}$). Although such perturbations arise naturally within $\\Lambda$CDM, most cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models to date omit them. These perturbations are strongly anti-correlated with the matter overdensity field such that halos form with baryon fractions below the cosmic mean, with earlier-collapsing halos exhibiting stronger baryonic suppression. To isolate the galaxy response, we analyse three hydrodynamical simulations with identical initial matter overdensity fields that: i) include isocurvature modes, ii) omit them, or iii) invert their amplitude. At $z=8$, isocurvature perturbations reduce the mean baryon fraction and star formation rates of resolved halos by $ 5\\%$ and $ 12\\%$, respectively, relative to the null-isocurvature case. These effects are almost independent of halo mass and diminish steadily with time, reaching $ 0.1\\%$ and $ 1\\%$ by $z=0$. We develop a model based on spherical collapse that accurately reproduces the mean baryon fraction suppression. As high-redshift observations become increasingly routine, incorporating isocurvature perturbations into simulations and semi-analytic models will be important for robust predictions of early galaxy and black hole formation in the JWST era.",

Zucker Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present results of a spectroscopic campaign around the diffuse dwarf galaxy Crater 2 (Cra2) and its tidal tails as part of the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey ($S^5$). Cra2 is a Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellite with extremely cold kinematics, but a huge size similar to the Small Magellanic Cloud, which may be difficult to explain within collisionless cold dark matter. We identify 143 Cra2 members, of which 114 belong to the galaxy's main body and 29 are deemed part of its stellar stream. We confirm that Cra2 is dynamically cold (central velocity dispersion $2.51^{+0.33}_{-0.30}\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$) and also discover a $\\approx$7$\\sigma$ velocity gradient consistent with its tidal debris track. We separately estimate the stream velocity dispersion to be $5.74^{+0.98}_{-0.83}\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$. We develop a suite of $N$-body simulations with both cuspy and cored density profiles on a realistic Cra2 orbit to compare with $S^5$ observations. We find that the velocity dispersion ratio between Cra2 stream and galaxy ($2.30^{+0.41}_{-0.35}$) is difficult to reconcile with a cuspy halo with fiducial concentration and an initial mass predicted by standard stellar mass$-$halo mass relationships. Instead, either a cored halo with relatively small core radius or a low-concentration cuspy model can reproduce this ratio. Despite tidal mass loss, Cra2 is metal-poor ($\\langle \\rm[Fe/H]\\rangle=-2.16\\pm0.04$) compared to the stellar mass$-$metallicity relation for its luminosity. Other diffuse dwarf galaxies similar to Cra2 in the Local Group (Antlia 2 and Andromeda 19) also challenge galaxy formation models. Finally, we discuss possible formation scenarios for Cra2, including ram-pressure stripping of a gas-rich progenitor combined with tides.",

Villanueva, P. van der Werf Submitted to A&A; 10 pages + appendices; 4 figures in main text; abstract abridged Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) A complete overview of the stellar, gas and dust contents of galaxies is key to understanding their assembly at early times. However, an estimation of molecular and atomic gas reservoirs at high redshift relies on various indirect tracers, while robust dust mass measurements require multi-band far-infrared continuum observations. We take census of the full baryonic content of the main-sequence star-forming galaxy HZ10 at $z=5.65$, a unique case study where all necessary tracers are available. We present new ALMA Band 10 ($\\lambda_\\mathrm{rest}=50\\mu$m) and Band 4 ($300\\mu$m) observations towards HZ10, which combined with previously taken ALMA Band 6 through 9 data ($70-200\\mu$m) constrains its dust properties. We complete the baryonic picture using archival high-resolution [CII] observations that provide both a dynamical mass and molecular and atomic gas mass estimates, a JVLA CO(2-1)-based molecular gas mass, and JWST metallicity and stellar mass measurements. We detect continuum emission from HZ10 in Bands 10 and 4 at the $3.4-4.0\\sigma$ level, and measure a dust temperature of $T_\\mathrm{dust} = 37_{-5}^{+6}$K and dust mass $\\log(M_\\mathrm{dust}/M_\\odot) = 8.0 \\pm 0.1$. Leveraging the dynamical constraints, we infer its total gas budget, and find that commonly used [CII]-to-H$_2$ and [CII]-to-HI conversions overpredict the gas mass relative to the dynamical mass. For this reason, we derive a [CII]-to-total ISM mass (atomic + molecular) conversion factor, which for HZ10 corresponds to $\\alpha_\\mathrm{[CII]}^\\mathrm{ISM} = 39^{+50}_{-25}M_\\odot L_\\odot^{-1}$. We also find that HZ10 falls below the local scaling relation between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity, suggesting inefficient ISM dust growth. These results demonstrate a powerful synergy between ALMA and JWST in disentangling the baryonic components of early galaxies, paving the way for future studies of larger samples.",

We select $\\sim 10,200$ galaxies with stellar masses $M_\\star>10^{9.5}~{\\text{M}}_\\odot$ from publicly available JWST/NIRCam-selected catalogs. Using 2D Sérsic profile fits to account for PSF broadening, we perform spatially resolved SED fitting on HST and JWST/NIRCam photometry retrieving accurate rest-frame ${\\textit{U}} - {\\textit{V}}$ and ${\\textit{V}} - {\\textit{J}}$ color gradients within 2$R_\\text{e, F444W}$. Star-forming galaxies generally exhibit negative ${\\textit{V}} - {\\textit{J}}$ color gradients that are strongly mass and redshift dependent. For massive star-forming galaxies ($M_\\star>10^{10.5}~{\\text{M}}_\\odot$) at $z>1.5$ ${\\textit{V}} - {\\textit{J}}$ colors are $\\approx 0.5$ mag redder within the effective radius than outside, on average. We find that, at all redshifts and across the entire stellar mass range, ${\\textit{V}} - {\\textit{J}}$ gradients strongly correlate with global attenuation ($A_V$), suggesting that they predominantly trace dust attenuation gradients. Edge-on galaxies are redder and have stronger gradients at all $z$, although the correlation weakens at higher $z$. The ${\\textit{U}} - {\\textit{V}}$ and ${\\textit{V}} - {\\textit{J}}$ color gradients in the quiescent galaxy population, in contrast, are weakly negative (from $\\approx -0.1$ to $\\approx- 0.2$ mag), though significant, and show little or no dependence on stellar mass, redshift or axis ratio. The implication is that quiescent galaxies must be largely transparent, with low $A_V$, and color gradients mostly attributable to stellar population gradients.",

Speranza 14 pages, 7 figures. Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Type-2 quasars (QSO2s) are AGN seen through a significant amount of dust and gas that obscures the central supermassive black hole and the broad line region. Despite this, recent mid-infrared spectra of the central 0.5-1.1 kpc of five QSO2s at z~0.1, obtained with the MRS module of JWST/MIRI, revealed 9.7, 18, and 23 micron silicate features in emission in two of them. This indicates that the high angular resolution of JWST/MIRI now allows us to peer into their nuclear region, exposing some of the directly illuminated dusty clouds that produce silicate emission. To test this, we fitted the nuclear mid-infrared spectrum of the QSO2 with the strongest silicate features, J1010, with two different sets of torus models implemented in an updated version of the Bayesian tool {\\tt BayesClumpy}. These are the CLUMPY and the CAT3D-WIND models. The CAT3D-WIND model is preferred by the observations based on the marginal likelihood and fit residuals, although the two torus models successfully reproduce the spectrum by means of intermediate covering factors ($\\rm C_T=0.45\\pm^{0.26}_{0.18}$ and $\\rm C_T=0.66\\pm^{0.16}_{0.17}$ for the CLUMPY and CAT3D-WIND models) and low inclinations ($\\rm i=50^\\circ\\pm^{8^\\circ}_{9^\\circ}$ and $\\rm i=13^\\circ\\pm^{7^\\circ}_{6^\\circ}$). Indeed, four of the five QSO2s with JWST/MIRI observations, including J1010, are in the blowout or ''forbidden'' region of the Eddington ratio-column density diagram, indicating that they are actively clearing gas and dust from their nuclear regions, leading to reduced covering factors. This is in contrast with Seyfert 2 galaxies observed with JWST, which are in the ''permitted'' regions of the diagram and show 9.7 micron silicate features in absorption. This supports a scenario where the more luminous the AGN and the higher their Eddington ratio, the lower the torus covering factor, driven by radiation pressure on dusty gas.",

Blanc accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The chemical abundance of the interstellar medium sets the initial conditions for star formation and provides a probe of chemical galaxy evolution models. However, unresolved inhomogeneities in the electron temperature can lead to a systematic underestimation of the abundances. We aim to directly test this effect. We use the SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper to spatially map the physical conditions of the Trifid Nebula (M 20), a Galactic H II region ionized by a single mid-type O star, at 0.24 pc resolution. We exploit various emission lines (e.g., Hydrogen recombination lines and collisionally excited lines, including also faint auroral lines) and compute spatially resolved maps of [O II] and [S II] electron densities; [N II], [O II], [S II], [S III] electron temperatures; and the ionic oxygen abundances. We find internal variations of electron density that result from the ionization front, along with a negative radial gradient. However, we do not find strong gradients or structures in the electron temperature and the total oxygen abundance, making the Trifid Nebula a relatively homogeneous H II region at the observed spatial scale. We compare these spatially resolved properties with equivalent integrated measurements of the Trifid Nebula and find no significant variations between integrated and spatially resolved conditions. This isolated H II region, ionized by a single O-star, represents a test case of an ideal Strömgren sphere. The physical conditions in the Trifid Nebula behave as expected, with no significant differences between integrated and resolved measurements.",

We used tidal features, detected in deep images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey, as direct evidence of recent mergers. We find that the fraction of type 1 AGN hosts with tidal features ($f_T$) is higher for AGNs with higher luminosities and (to a lesser extent) more massive black holes. Specifically, $f_T$ rapidly increases from $0.05\\pm0.03$ to $0.75\\pm0.13$ as the luminosity of the $[\\mathrm{O\\,{\\scriptstyle III}}]$ $\\lambda$5007 emission line ($L_{[\\mathrm{O\\,{\\scriptstyle III}}]}$), an indicator for bolometric AGN luminosity, increases in the range $10^{39.5}\\lesssim L_{[\\mathrm{O\\,{\\scriptstyle III}}]}/(\\mathrm{erg\\,s}^{-1}) \\lesssim10^{42.5}$. In addition, $f_T$ increases from $0.13\\pm0.03$ to $0.43\\pm0.09$ as black hole mass ($M_\\mathrm{BH}$) increases in the range $10^{6.0}\\lesssim M_\\mathrm{BH}/M_{\\odot}\\lesssim10^{8.5}$. The fraction $f_T$ also increases with the Eddington ratio, although the trend is less significant compared to that with $L_{[\\mathrm{O\\,{\\scriptstyle III}}]}$ and $M_\\mathrm{BH}$. The excess of $f_T$, defined as the ratio of $f_T$ for AGNs to that of their matched inactive counterparts, exhibits similar trends, primarily increasing with $L_{[\\mathrm{O\\,{\\scriptstyle III}}]}$ and weakly with $M_\\mathrm{BH}$. Our results indicate that, in the local Universe, galaxy mergers are the predominant triggering mechanism for high-luminosity AGNs, whereas they play a lesser role in triggering lower-luminosity AGNs. Additionally, strong events, such as galaxy mergers, may be more necessary to activate massive black holes in more massive galaxies due to their lower gas fractions.",

We robustly identified $11,346$ quasars, of which $5,386$ are newly discovered objects not present in the Million Quasars catalog. This release brings the total number of quasars identified by the 12-year LAMOST survey to $67,521$, of which $29,513$ are newly discovered. While the absolute flux calibration for LAMOST quasar spectra from Data Releases 6 to 9 was previously performed using the SDSS/PanSTARRS1 multi-band photometric data, the inherent variability of quasars can affect the flux accuracy. To address this limitation, we recalibrated the LAMOST spectra using (quasi-)simultaneous photometric data from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which has conducted high-cadence sky monitoring since March 2018. Based on the recalibrated single-epoch spectra, we estimated the emission line fluxes, continuum fluxes, and virial black hole masses. These improved spectra facilitate direct comparison with the spectra of common quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), enabling searches for rare quasars, such as changing-look quasars exhibiting the appearance or disappearance of broad emission lines and broad absorption line quasars. The combined dataset of photometry and multi-epoch spectra will enhance the detections of AGN-related transients, such as Bowen fluorescence flares and extreme variability quasars, thereby improving our understanding of quasar variability.",

Gopakumar, Paramasivan Arumugam This research article is accepted and will be appearing in Physical Review D Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) A very recent and meticulous timing effort suggests that an eccentric millisecond pulsar (eMSP) binary, namely PSR J1618-3921, is likely to be a part of a hierarchical triple (HT) system with a $0.6M_{\\odot}$ companion in a $\\sim 300$yr orbit. We investigate observational implications of the proposed HT scenario for PSR J1618-3921 and our ability to constrain the scenario. We model the MSP-Helium White Dwarf binary to be a part of bound point-mass HT, while incorporating the effects due to the quadrupolar interactions between the inner and outer binaries, along with dominant order general relativistic contributions to the periastron precession of the inner binary. If the proposed HT system is indeed undergoing Kozai oscillations at the present epoch, the orbital eccentricity ($e$) would be expected to decrease, while the rate of periastron advance ($\\dot{\\omega}$) would correspondingly increase, for plausible ranges of the HT parameters. Furthermore, the fractional variations in $e$ are anticipated to be at the level of a few parts in $10^{5}$-a magnitude that is substantially larger than the current measurement precision of $e$. We find that, for this eccentric MSP binary, the HT configurations that minimize the temporal evolution of orbital eccentricity and argument of periastron are mutually incompatible. This indicates that the continued high-precision timing of PSR J1618-3921-when analyzed within the framework introduced here-should place stringent limits on the presence and properties of a potential third body in the system.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) In dense environments, mechanisms like ram pressure stripping (RPS) and gravitational interactions can induce similar morphological features in galaxies, distinguishable only through detailed study of their stellar properties. While RPS affects recently formed stars by displacing the gas disk from which they form, gravitational interactions perturb stars of all ages rather similarly. We present the first observational test of the Size-Shape Difference (SSD) measure, a novel approach validated for simulated galaxies, that quantifies morphological differences between young and intermediate-age stellar populations to distinguish RPS from gravitationally interacting galaxies. We analyze 67 galaxies from the GASP survey using spatially-resolved star formation histories derived using SINOPSIS. In our fiducial model, we compare stellar populations in two age bins (t < 20 Myr and 20 Myr <= t < 570 Myr) to calculate SSD values. The sample includes confirmed RPS cases with different stripping intensities, as well as undisturbed and gravitationally interacting galaxies. We find that extreme cases of RPS show SSD values ~3.5x higher than undisturbed and gravitationally interacting galaxies (56(+24/-15) as compared to 16(+6/-2) and 16(+6/-3), respectively), confirming simulation predictions. This enhancement reflects RPS-induced asymmetries: youngest stars are compressed along the leading edge and/or displaced into the extended tails of cold gas, while older populations remain undisturbed. In contrast, gravitational interactions perturb all stars uniformly, producing lower SSD values. SSD robustly distinguishes strong RPS cases, even adopting different age bins. This holds even without correcting for disk inclination, or when single-band imaging are used to trace stellar distributions. This makes SSD a promising tool to select RPS candidates for spectroscopic follow-up in upcoming surveys.",

In this composite spectrum we identify more than 70 absorption lines, and observe oxygen and hydrogen emission features at a higher signal-to-noise ratio than in any previous study. As the light from a distant quasar travels towards an observer, it may interact with the circumgalactic medium environment of an intervening galaxy, forming absorption lines. In order to maximize the signal of these absorption lines, we have selected a sample of 238,838 quasar spectra from the second data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), each identified to have absorption lines resulting from such an interaction. By stacking these spectra in the restframe of the absorption, and calculating a median composite spectrum, we are able to isolate and enhance these absorption lines. We provide a full atlas of all detected absorption and emission lines as well as their fit centroids and equivalent width values. This atlas should aid in future studies investigating the compositions and physical conditions of these absorbers.",

Accepted in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present new MIRI F560W, F770W and F1000W imaging of GN-z11, extending the previous rest-frame coverage from 0.38 to 0.86$\\mu$m. We report significant detections (14$\\sigma$) in the F560W and F770W images, and a marginal detection (3.2$\\sigma$) in F1000W. Here, we analyse its SED combining new MIRI imaging data with archival NIRSpec/Prism and MRS spectroscopy, and NIRCam imaging. The continuum emission shows a flat energy distribution, in f$_\\nu$, up to 0.5$\\mu$m, compatible with the presence of a mixed stellar population of young (4$\\pm$1 Myr) and mature (63$\\pm$23 Myr) stars that also account for the [O III], H$\\beta$ and H$\\alpha$ emission lines. The continuum at rest-frame 0.66$\\mu$m shows a 36$\\pm$3% flux excess above the predicted flux for a mixed stellar population, pointing to the presence of an additional source contributing at these wavelengths. This excess increases to 91$\\pm$28% at rest-frame 0.86$\\mu$m, although with a large uncertainty due to the marginal detection in the F1000W filter. We consider that hot dust emission in the dusty torus around a type 2 AGN could be responsible for the observed excess. Alternatively, this excess could be due to hot dust emission or to a photoluminiscence dust process (Extended Red Emission, ERE) under the extreme UV radiation field, as observed in some local metal-poor galaxies and in young compact starbursts. The presence of a type 1 AGN is not supported by the observed SED since high-z QSOs contribute at wavelengths above rest-frame 1$\\mu$m, and an additional ad-hoc red source would be required to explain the observed flux excess at 0.66 and 0.86$\\mu$m. Additional deep MIRI imaging covering the rest-frame near-IR are needed to confirm the flux detection at 10$\\mu$m with higher significance, and to discriminate between the different hot dust emission in the extreme starburst and AGN scenarios with MIRI imaging at longer wavelengths.",

The ab initio calculations of the adiabatic potentials and other molecular functions are performed in a wide range of interatomic separations, $r=1$-17 bohr. We consider the model of two interacting electronic states including both the bound states and the resonances of two kinds, the tunneling resonances and the predissociative ones. The Born-Oppenheimer potentials are modeled with use of two functions imitating the diabatic terms whereas the coupling between them was set constant equal to the half of the minimum separation between the adiabatic terms, and then we define the final diabatic terms and the final diabatic coupling via the adiabatic potentials and the angle of the adiabatic-to-diabatic basis rotation obtained by integration of the nonadiabatic coupling matrix element. The energies of the bound states, as well as the positions and widths of the resonances are calculated. The observed transition frequencies are reproduced with the standard deviation of 0.0009 cm$^{-1}$ for $^7$LiF, 0.0006 cm$^{-1}$ for $^6$LiF, and within the experimental uncertainties for the most of the lines.

To be submitted to the Open Journal of Astrophysics Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Interstellar objects (ISOs), particularly those with cometary activity, provide unique insight into the primordial physical and chemical conditions present during the formation of the planetary system in which they originated. Observations in the sub-mm regime allow for direct measurements of several parent molecules released from the comet nucleus into the coma. Here we present observations of the third ISO, 3I/ATLAS, with the `Ū`ū heterodyne receiver on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), which targeted emission from HCN($J = 3 - 2$) and CO($J = 2 - 1$). Our observations, taken between 16 July 2025 and 21 July 2025 (UT), when 3I/ATLAS was at a heliocentric distance between 4.01 and 3.84 au, provide the earliest sub-mm constraints on its activity. We do not detect HCN or CO in these epochs, with 3$\\sigma$ upper-limits on the production rates of $Q(HCN) < 1.7 \\times 10^{24}$ s$^{-1}$ at $r_h = 4.01 - 3.97$ au and $Q(CO) < 1.1 \\times 10^{27}$ s$^{-1}$ at $r_h = 3.94 - 3.84$ au, respectively. We combine this HCN limit with later JCMT observations of HCN to constrain its temporal evolution. Fitting the HCN detections with a $Q(HCN) \\propto r_h^{-n}$ model and accounting for the upper-limits yields $n = 12.7^{+6.9}_{-2.5}$. This slope is steeper than those of typical Solar System comets, but consistent with the production rate slopes measured for other species in the coma of 3I/ATLAS.",

Submitted to PASP Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Kappa Velorum (Markeb, HD 81188) is one of the brightest stars in the Southern sky and has long been known to be a single-lined spectroscopic binary. The binary mass function is large, $f(M)=1.15\\ M_\\odot$, suggesting that the bright (V=2.5) B2IV star may host a dark, compact object companion. We use VLTI GRAVITY observations to definitively test this possibility by directly resolving the binary. We detect a main sequence B star companion and rule out the compact object scenario. By combining the relative astrometric orbit and archival radial velocities, we report an updated precise characterization of the orbit (period $P=116.795\\pm0.002$ d, eccentricity $e=0.1764\\pm0.0004$, inclination $i=74.04\\pm0.01^{\\circ}$) and estimate the masses of the B stars. Using the original Hipparcos parallax measurement $\\varpi = 6.05\\pm0.48$ mas, we find $M_1 = 10^{+4}_{-2}\\ M_\\odot$ and $M_2 = 6.9\\pm1.0\\ M_\\odot$. The uncertainties on the masses are primarily driven by the uncertain parallax, which we find is likely biased by the orbital motion. We use an archival UVES spectrum and MIST evolutionary tracks to refine our mass estimates. Finally, we discuss how interferometry and high-contrast imaging may be used to characterize other candidate star+compact object binaries, including those that will be discovered with Gaia DR4, as part of a larger effort to uncover the hidden population of black holes in the Milky Way.",

Strassmeier Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present the abundances of 23 elements, including 11 heavy elements (Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu) for up to 86 metal-poor (-2 < [Fe/H] < -1) subgiants. We use KORG, a state of the art spectral synthesis package, to derive 1D-LTE abundances from high-SNR and high-resolution spectra taken by the Large Binocular Telescope with the Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument. These precise spectra and abundance measurements minimize the impact of photon-noise (<0.06 dex), allowing us to robustly measure the intrinsic abundance scatter in [X/Fe]. After removing two stars with exceptional s-process enhancement, we find that the intrinsic scatter among the s- and r-process elements tends to be larger than for the lighter elements, with heavy element scatter ranging from 0.11 (Zn) to 0.27 (Eu) dex. Intrinsic abundance scatter could have multiple origins, including star-to-star variations in the ratios of nucleosynthetic sources as well as stochastic sampling of the progenitor supernovae properties, such as mass, rotation, and magnetic field strength. We explore the expected abundance scatter signature caused by stochastic sampling, finding that a fraction of both rapidly rotating CCSN and magnetorotationally driven SN are needed to reach the observed abundances and intrinsic scatter. This analysis is limited by the restrictive parameter spaces spanned by existing yield sets. A diverse, finely sampled grid of supernovae yields is needed to robustly model stochastic abundance scatter.",

O'Shea 8 pages, 5 figures, Published in MNRAS MNRAS, 531, 259-266 (Issue 1, June 2024) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Radiative cooling and AGN heating are thought to form a feedback loop that regulates the evolution of low redshift cool-core galaxy clusters. Numerical simulations suggest that formation of multiphase gas in the cluster core imposes a floor on the ratio of cooling time ($t_{\\rm cool}$) to free-fall time ($t_{\\rm ff}$) at $\\min ( t_{\\rm cool} / t_{\\rm ff} ) \\approx 10$. Observations of galaxy clusters show evidence for such a floor, and usually the cluster cores with $\\min ( t_{\\rm cool} / t_{\\rm ff} ) \\lesssim 30$ contain abundant multiphase gas. However, there are important outliers. One of them is Abell 2029, a massive galaxy cluster ($M_{200} \\gtrsim 10^{15}$ M$_\\odot$) with $\\min( t_{\\rm cool}/t_{\\rm ff}) \\sim 20$, but little apparent multiphase gas. In this paper, we present high resolution 3D hydrodynamic AMR simulations of a cluster similar to A2029 and study how it evolves over a period of 1-2 Gyr. Those simulations suggest that Abell 2029 self-regulates without producing multiphase gas because the mass of its central black hole ($\\sim 5\\times 10^{10} \\, M_\\odot$) is great enough for Bondi accretion of hot ambient gas to produce enough feedback energy to compensate for radiative cooling.",

This version matches the accepted manuscript Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) In recent years, observations with the JWST have started to map out the rapid metal enrichment of the early Universe, while (sub)millimeter observations have simultaneously begun to reveal the ubiquity of dust beyond $z\\gtrsim6$. However, the pathways that led to the assembly of early dust reservoirs remain poorly quantified, and require pushing our understanding of key scaling relations between dust, gas and metals into the early Universe. We investigate the dust build-up in twelve $6.5 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 7.7$ galaxies drawn from the REBELS survey that benefit from (i) JWST/NIRSpec strong-line metallicity measurements, (ii) ALMA [CII]-based redshifts and gas masses, and (iii) dust masses from single- or multi-band ALMA continuum observations. Combining these measurements, we investigate the dust-to-gas (DtG), dust-to-metal (DtM), and dust-to-stellar mass (DtS) ratios of our sample as a function of metallicity. While our analysis is limited by systematic uncertainties related to the [CII]-to-H$_2$ conversion factor and dust temperature, we explore a wide range of possible values, and carefully assess their impact on our results. Under a fiducial set of assumptions, we find an average $\\log(\\mathrm{DtG}) = -3.02 \\pm 0.23$, only slightly below that of local metal-rich galaxies. On the other hand, at fixed metallicity our average $\\log(\\mathrm{DtS}) = -2.15 \\pm 0.42$ is significantly larger than that of low-redshift galaxies. Finally, through a comparison to various theoretical models of high-redshift dust production, we find that assembling the dust reservoirs in massive galaxies at $z\\approx7$ likely requires the combination of rapid supernova enrichment and efficient ISM dust growth.",

We study the ionized gas kinematics, dynamical mass and gas-flow properties of a sample of 16 sub-$L^{\\star}$ star-forming galaxies at $4\\leq z\\leq7.6$, using high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec observations. The emission lines are resolved, with velocity dispersions ($\\sigma_{\\rm gas}{\\rm~(km~s^{-1})}\\simeq38-96$) comparable to more massive galaxies at Cosmic Noon. From $\\sigma_{\\rm gas}$ and the galaxy size ($r_e=400-960~$pc), we estimate the dynamical mass to be $\\log M_{\\rm dyn}/M_{\\odot}=9.25-10.25$. Stellar-to-dynamical mass ratios are low ($\\log M_{\\star}/M_{\\rm dyn}\\in[-0.5,-2]$) and decrease with increasing SFR surface density ($\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$). We estimate the gas surface densities assuming a star-formation law, but the gas masses do not balance the baryon-to-dynamical mass ratios, which would require a decrease in the star-formation efficiency. We find evidence of ionized outflows in five out of the sixteen galaxies, based on the need of broad components to reproduce the emission-line wings. We only observe outflows from galaxies undergoing recent bursts of star formation ${\\rm SFR_{10}/SFR_{100}\\geq1}$, with elevated $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$ and low $M_{\\star}/M_{\\rm dyn}$. This links high gas surface densities to increased outflow incidence and lower $M_{\\star}/M_{\\rm dyn}$. With moderate outflow velocities ($v_{\\rm flow}{\\rm~(km~s^{-1})}=150-250$) and mass outflow rates ($\\dot{M}_{\\rm flow}/{\\rm M_{\\odot} yr^{-1}}=0.2-5$), these high-redshift galaxies appear more efficient at removing baryons than low-redshift galaxies with similar $M_{\\star}$, showing mass loading-factors of $\\dot{M}_{\\rm flow}/{\\rm SFR}=0.04-0.4$. For their given dynamical mass, the outflow velocities exceed the escape velocities, meaning that they may eventually enrich the Circumgalactic Medium.",

This bright-rimmed cloud appears optically to be one single cloud illuminated by the UV light from the excited star of IC 1396, however our Stokes I image and 13CO(J=3-2) archival data suggest that this cloud is not a simple, single structure, but appears to be composed of two parts on first glance; a head part with wings and a tail, and a north-west extension this http URL molecular clouds are generally filamentary and it seems likely that the initial structures of bright-rimmed clouds are expected to be also generally elongated, we examined the possibility that the structure was created from a single elongated cloud by the UV impact. We compared the cloud structure with a simulation study that investigated the evolution of prolate clouds exposed to the UV radiation from various directions and found that this apparent two-part structure could be reproduced in a situation where a single filamentary cloud is obliquely illuminated by UV light. The magnetic field directions of the cloud are different from the ambient field direction, demonstrating the field reconfiguration. The distortion or pinch of the magnetic field is seen toward the cloud head, where an intermediate-mass star cluster is located, suggesting gravitational contraction. We roughly estimated the magnetic strength and stability in three parts of the cloud and found that the cloud head is most likely to be supercritical.",

Sander, Miriam Garcia Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Chemically homogeneously evolving stars have been proposed to account for several exotic phenomena, including gravitational-wave emissions and gamma-ray bursts. Here we study whether these stars can explain the metal-poor dwarf galaxy I Zwicky 18. We apply our synthetic spectral models from Paper II to (i) establish a classification sequence for these hot stars, (ii) predict the photonionizing flux and the strength of emission lines from a IZw18-like stellar population, and (iii) compare our predictions to available observations of this galaxy. Adding two new models computed with PoWR, we report (i) these stars to follow a unique sequence of classes: O->WN->WO (i.e. without ever being WC). From our population synthesis with standard assumptions, we predict that (ii) the source of the UV C-IV and other emission bumps is a couple dozen WO-type Wolf-Rayet stars (not WC as previously assumed) which are the result of chem. hom. evolution, while these, combined with the rest of the O-star population, account for the He-II ionizing flux and spectral hardness. Contrasting our results against published optical and UV data and accounting for different aperture sizes and spatial regions probed by the observations, we find that (iii) our models are highly consistent with them. Since our \"massive Pop II stars\" might just as well exist in early star-forming regions, our findings have implications for upcoming JWST surveys; and given that our results apply for binary populations too as long as the same fraction (10%) of the systems evolves chem. homogeneously, we conclude that the stellar progenitors of gravitational waves may very well exist today in IZw18.",

Oesch, Callum Witten, Andrea Weibel, Cristian Carvajal-Bohorquez, Laure Ciesla, Emma Giovinazzo, Gabriel Brammer Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) JWST has revealed a population of ``dormant'' galaxies at $z>5$ that have recently halted their star formation and are characterized by weak emission lines and significant Balmer breaks. Until now, only four such galaxies have been reported at $z>5$, three with low stellar masses, $M_*<10^9M_\\odot$ (so-called mini-quenched galaxies), and one massive quiescent galaxy with $M_*=10^{10.2}M_\\odot$; no such galaxy had been reported at intermediate masses. Here, we present a systematic search for dormant galaxies at $5<z<7.4$ that halted star formation at least 10 Myr before the time of observation. To do this, we made use of all the publicly available NIRSpec prism data in the DAWN JWST Archive (DJA) and selected galaxies with low H$\\alpha$ equivalent widths ($EW_{0}<50$Å) and strong Balmer breaks ($F_{\\nu,4200}/F_{\\nu,3500}>1.4$). We find 14 dormant galaxies with stellar masses ranging from $10^{7.6}-10^{10.5}$, revealing an intermediate-mass population. By construction, these 14 sources are located about 1 dex below the star-forming main sequence. Their star formation histories suggest that they halted star formation between 10 and 25 Myr before the time of observation which, according to models, is comparable with the timescales of internally regulated bursts driving a ``breathing'' mode of star formation. Our results show that $\\sim1\\%$ of the galaxies in the DJA are in a dormant phase of their star formation histories, and they span a wide stellar mass range. These galaxies can be empirically selected using only their spectral features in NIRSpec prism data.",

Morales et al 2025 ApJ 994 212 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a sample of 53 galaxy spectra at z_spec ~ 5-12 from the JWST CEERS and RUBIES surveys, combining NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy with NIRCam photometry. We aim to use these data to establish best practices for measuring the UV spectral slope ($\\beta$) in the era of JWST. We adopt power-law fits to the rest-frame UV continuum from the spectroscopic data as our fiducial, or `true', $\\beta$ values, and compare them to photometric estimates derived through four methods: (1) photometric power-law fitting, (2) power-law fitting to an SED model fitted to the photometry, (3) single-color fitting near the Lyman break, and (4) single-color fitting at fixed rest-frame wavelengths. We find that photometric power-law fitting most closely recovers the spectroscopic slopes, with minimal bias and scatter. SED fitting performs moderately well, and can be preferable in cases of low signal-to-noise where photometric power-law fitting may become unreliable. Single-color estimates, while commonly used in past studies, show the most significant deviations and are not recommended when more than a single color is available. Our results highlight the limitations and strengths of each approach and provide practical guidance for measuring $\\beta$ from photometry when spectra are unavailable or are of insufficient quality.",

Comments welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Photometric redshifts (photo-$z$'s) are crucial for the cosmology, galaxy evolution, and transient science drivers of next-generation imaging facilities like the Euclid Mission, the Rubin Observatory, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Previous work has shown that image-based deep learning photo-$z$ methods produce smaller scatter than photometry-based classical machine learning (ML) methods on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Main Galaxy Sample, a testbed photo-$z$ dataset. However, global assessments can obscure local trends. To explore this possibility, we used a self-organizing map (SOM) to cluster SDSS galaxies based on their $ugriz$ colors. Deep learning methods achieve lower photo-$z$ scatter than classical ML methods for all SOM cells. The fractional reduction in scatter is roughly constant across most of color space with the exception of the most bulge-dominated and reddest cells where it is smaller in magnitude. Interestingly, classical ML photo-$z$'s suffer from a significant color-dependent attenuation bias, where photo-$z$'s for galaxies within a SOM cell are systematically biased towards the cell's mean spectroscopic redshift and away from extreme values, which is not readily apparent when all objects are considered. In contrast, deep learning photo-$z$'s suffer from very little color-dependent attenuation bias. The increased attenuation bias for classical ML photo-$z$ methods is the primary reason why they exhibit larger scatter than deep learning methods. This difference can be explained by the deep learning methods weighting redshift information from the individual pixels of a galaxy image more optimally than integrated photometry.",

Submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Spatially resolved gas-phase metallicity maps are a crucial element in understanding the chemical evolution of galaxies. We present spatially resolved metallicity maps obtained from NIRISS/WFSS observations. This is the first such work presenting multiple individual galaxies. We investigate the source of ionisation, metallicity and its relation to star-formation in a spatially-resolved sense for a sample of eight galaxies -- four from JWST-PASSAGE and four from GLASS-JWST ERS. All but one galaxy are in the redshift range $1.9 \\leq z \\leq 2$, the outlier being at $z = 3.1$. Our sample covers a range of $8.0 <$ \\logM $< 9.5$ in stellar mass, $0.2 <$ $\\log{\\rm{(SFR}}$/\\Msunpyr) $< 1.1$ in star-formation rate (SFR) and $7.8 <$ \\logOH $< 9.0$ in global metallicity. As a solution to the challenge of SF-AGN demarcation in absence of resolved \\halpha, we present a new SF-demarcation line in the \\textit{OHNO} parameter space based on MAPPINGS v5.1 publicly available \\hii region model grids. We present the mass-metallicity gradient relation for our sample, which showed no clear trend with stellar mass, perhaps hinting at the fact that the high-$z$ galaxies have not yet started their accretion dominated phase. By interpreting the correlation between spatially resolved metallicity and SFR maps as a proxy for effective timescales of metal-transport in galaxies, we find a weak trend such that this timescale increases with stellar mass, implying a more effective feedback in lower mass galaxies.",

Accepted to ApJL with minor text revisions; results unchanged Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The extremely-low-luminosity, compact Milky Way satellite Ursa Major III / UNIONS 1 (UMaIII/U1; $L_V = 11 \\ L_{\\odot}$; $a_{1/2} = 3$ pc) was found to have a substantial velocity dispersion at the time of its discovery ($\\sigma_v = 3.7^{+1.4}_{-1.0} \\rm \\ km \\ s^{-1}$), suggesting that it might be an exceptional, highly dark-matter-dominated dwarf galaxy with very few stars. However, significant questions remained about the system's dark matter content and nature as a dwarf galaxy due to the small member sample ($N=11$), possible spectroscopic binaries, and the lack of any metallicity information. Here, we present new spectroscopic observations covering $N=16$ members that both dynamically and chemically test UMaIII/U1's true nature. From higher-precision Keck/DEIMOS spectra, we find a 95% confidence level velocity dispersion limit of $\\sigma_v< 2.3 \\rm \\ km \\ s^{-1}$, with a $\\sim$120:1 likelihood ratio now favoring the expected stellar-only dispersion of $\\sigma_* \\approx 0.1 \\rm \\ km \\ s^{-1}$ over the original $3.7 \\rm \\ km \\ s^{-1}$ dispersion. There is now no observational evidence for dark matter in the system. From Keck/LRIS spectra targeting the Calcium II K line, we also measure the first metallicities for 12 member stars, finding a mean metallicity of $\\rm [Fe/H] = -2.65 \\; \\pm \\, 0.1$ (stat.) $\\pm \\,0.3$ (zeropoint) with a metallicity dispersion limit of $\\sigma_{\\rm [Fe/H]} < 0.35$ dex (at the 95% credible level). Together, these properties are more consistent with UMaIII/U1 being a star cluster, though the dwarf galaxy scenario is not fully ruled out. Under this interpretation, UMaIII/U1 ranks among the faintest and most metal-poor star clusters yet discovered.",

Recently, a method based on Gaia astrometric measurements has aided the selection of quasars reddened by dust hitherto overlooked. We conducted a spectroscopic study using VLT/X-Shooter on one such dust-reddened quasar, Q2310-3358. This quasar, at $z = 2.3909\\pm0.0022$, is associated with a damped Lyman-$\\alpha$ absorber (DLA) at nearly the same redshift $2.4007\\pm0.0003$, with a neutral hydrogen column density of $\\log N(HI)=21.214\\pm0.003$. The DLA is very metal-rich (close to solar metallicity after correction for depletion on dust grains). Its properties align with the metal-to-dust ratio and the mass-metallicity relation established in previous large samples of DLAs. Surprisingly, given its proximity to the quasar in redshift, the absorber has strong cold gas characteristics, including CI and H$_2$. Based on the derived kinetic temperature of $71^{+28}_{-15}$~K, we infer the presence of a strong UV radiation field, which in turn suggests that the quasar and the DLA are in close proximity, i.e., part of the same galaxy and not just different objects in the same overdensity of galaxies. We used the line ratios of the fine-structure lines to constrain the density of the cold gas, yielding $n_{\\rm H} \\sim 10^{3}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. Our analysis extends the understanding of $z_{abs} \\approx z_{em}$ absorption line systems and provides valuable constraints on the interplay between dust, metals, and neutral gas in the ISM of early galaxies.",

We identify a triaxial stellar halo (axes ratio $10:8:7$), 43 degrees tilted from the disk, showing two break radii at $\\sim16$ kpc and $\\sim76$ kpc, likely associated with Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE) and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), respectively. The inner stellar halo ($<30$ kpc) is oblate and aligned with the disk, whereas the outer stellar halo becomes prolate and perpendicular to the disk, consistent with the Vast Polar Structure of MW satellites. The twisted halo may arise from the disk-halo angular momentum shift triggered by the infall of a massive satellite. The anisotropic density distribution of the stellar halo is also measured, with successful re-identification of the Hercules-Aquila Cloud South/North (HAC-N/-S) and Virgo overdensities (VOD). Break radii are found at 15/30 kpc for VOD/HAC-N(-S). We identify the LMC transient density wake with a break radius at 60 kpc in the Pisces overdensity region. We also find new observational evidence of the LMC collective density wake, by showing a break radius at $\\sim$100 kpc in the northern Galactic cap with a clear density peak at 90 kpc. In the end, we found that more metal-poor halo stars are more radially extended. Our results provide important clues to the assembly and evolution of the MW stellar halo under the standard cosmic structure formation framework.",

Here we report results from JWST-MIRI MRS, HST-ACS and ALMA Band 7 observations. Despite its late spectral type (M7.25), the spectrum of J0438 resembles those of inner disks around earlier-type stars (K1-M5, T Tauri stars), with a volatile reservoir lacking hydrocarbons (except for acetylene, C$_2$H$_2$) and dominated by water. Other identified species are H$_2$, CO$_2$, HCN, [Ar$^{+}$], and [Ne$^{+}$]. The dominance of water over hydrocarbons is driven by multiple factors such as disk dynamics, young disk age, low accretion rate and possible inner disk clearing. J0438 appears highly dynamic, showing a seesaw-like variability and extended emission in H$_2 \\,\\,\\, S$(1), $S$(3), $S$(5), [Ne$^{+}$] and CO ($J=3-2$). Interestingly, the CO emission reaches up to 400 au from the brown dwarf, suggesting ongoing infalling/outflowing activity impacting the disk chemistry. These observations underscore the combined power of MIRI, HST and ALMA in characterizing the chemical diversity and dynamics of brown dwarf disks.",

ArCTIc code available from this https URL Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) From 2002 to 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys has suffered in the harsh radiation environment above the protection of the Earth's atmosphere. We track the degradation of its image quality, as Solar protons and galactic cosmic rays have damaged its photosensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging sensors. The rate of damage in low Earth orbit is modulated by $18.5^{+4.5}_{-0.5}$ per cent during an 11 year Solar cycle, peaking $430^{+11}_{-5}$ days after Solar minimum as recorded in the number of sunspots. The type of damage is consistent with defects in the silicon lattice that have all stabilised into one of three configurations. We also present the open-source Algorithm for Charge Transfer Inefficiency correction (ArCTIc) v7. This models the (instantaneous or gradual) capture of photoelectrons into lattice defects, and their release after (a discrete set or continuum of) characteristic time delays, which creates spurious trailing in an image. Calibrated using the trailing of hot pixels, and applied during post-processing of astronomical images, ArCTIc can correct 99.5% of Charge Transfer Inefficiency trailing averaged over the camera's lifetime, and 99.9% of trailing in the worst-affected recent data.",

Using data from the WIYN Open Cluster Study (WOCS) and APOGEE-2, this work nearly doubles the temporal baseline of the previous RV study of NGC 188.

With revised membership determinations using Gaia DR3 proper-motions and parallaxes, we reassess the cluster binary frequency and period-eccentricity distribution.

We find evidence that giants are deficient in short-period orbits, and suggest that the missing giants may have undergone mass transfer and in part formed the population of blue straggler stars (BSSs) and blue lurkers. Among the binaries of note, we highlight WOCS 3953 as a blue lurker candidate, WOCS 5020 and WOCS 4945 as very long-period eccentric BSSs, and WOCS 4230, a BSS with a very close WD companion.",

Ivlev, Tommaso Grassi, Paola Caselli, Volker Springel 16 pages, 12 Figures; updated version Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present an implementation of radiative transfer with flux-limited diffusion (FLD) for the moving-mesh code {\\small AREPO} and use the method in a physical model for the formation of protostars with non-ideal radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD). We follow previous work in splitting the additional terms to the hydrodynamical equations arising from the inclusion of radiation into terms to be integrated explicitly and implicitly, as the diffusion and coupling terms would impose very restrictive timestep criteria. We validate the scheme with standard test problems for radiation diffusion, matter-gas coupling, and radiative shocks from the literature. Our implementation is compatible with local timestepping, which often presents problems for implicit schemes, and we found very good agreement with results obtained with global timesteps. We present an example application of the new implementation to the collapse of a $1\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$ molecular cloud core to a second Larson core modelled with radiation non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics. A high-velocity jet with v$_{\\rm rad}> 10\\, {\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ is self-consistently launched from the second core, nested within the first core, which produces a lower-velocity magnetorotational outflow. We observe magnetic field amplification up to more than $\\vert \\mathbf{B}\\vert_{\\rm max}>10^5$ G in the second core, which is surrounded by a small (<0.5 au) disk. This application demonstrates the robustness of our scheme in multi-scale and high-resolution simulations on arbitrary meshes and, as such, the model can be readily used for further simulations of protostar formation at high resolution.",

Observed SEDs are compared with theoretical models to characterize the central stars and their circumstellar dust envelopes and to estimate distances. For the LMC, a set of best-fitting CAGB models is derived by fitting observed SEDs with radiative transfer models, utilizing the galaxy's well-established distance. For Galactic CAGB stars, where Gaia DR3 parallaxes are uncertain, we estimate distances by fitting observed SEDs with the CAGB models validated against LMC stars, and for Mira variables, from the period-magnitude relation calibrated with LMC Miras. A comparison of these approaches demonstrates that the SED-based distances are both reliable and practical for a large sample of Galactic CAGB stars. We find that CAGB stars in both galaxies show broadly similar infrared properties, although the LMC sample lacks stars with extremely thick dust envelopes.",

Antiochos Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The origin of the Sun's slow wind and its inherent variability remain unknown, but there is increasing evidence that interaction between closed and open magnetic flux in the corona plays a role. This paper studies the dynamic evolution of streamers and pseudostreamers with a particular focus on the release of plasma from the closed to the open field region. We employ a global magnetohydrodynamic model that extends from the solar chromosphere to 30 solar radii, and that extends previous interchange magnetic reconnection modelling by including self-consistent thermodynamics. We find that at both the helmet streamer and pseudostreamer there is a continual dynamic interaction between closed and open flux. At the helmet streamer, this takes the form of a ''breathing'' cycle in which the closed flux contracts and expands, and plasmoids are released along the heliospheric current sheet. The pseudostreamer exhibits a back-and-forth motion, driving interchange reconnection alternately on its opposite flanks. The resulting release of hot, dense plasma leads to density fluctuations in the open field that are significantly larger above the helmet streamer due to the persistence of the plasmoids there. Our model demonstrates that plasma is continually being released into the heliosphere from both streamers and pseudostreamers.",

      "abstract": "Convective Heat Transport Asymptotic Law in an $α^2$ dynamo model Giuseppina Nigro Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Stellar activity and planetary magnetospheres are powered by an underlying dynamo mechanism generated by magnetoconvection coupled with rotation. In astrophysical contexts, magnetoconvection typically occurs in parameter regimes that are currently inaccessible to direct numerical simulations (DNS). We investigate convective heat transfer in a magneto-convection and dynamo model under extreme parameter conditions, specifically high Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers, in a plasma flow with maximum kinetic helicity compatible with fast-rotating objects. Our approach to studying magneto-convection and dynamo mechanisms employs a simplified thermally driven shell model. Magnetic polarity reversals are obtained by including a pitchfork bifurcation term in the large-scale magnetic field equation, while nonlinear dynamics are described by a shell model formulation. The low computational cost of the model allows us to explore the asymptotic behavior of convective heat transfer in regimes beyond those reached by current DNS. Our results reveal that the Nusselt number $Nu$ -- a dimensionless measure of convective heat transport-- generally increases with turbulence, following a power-law scaling and showing a strong correlation with Ra and Pr. This relationship appears to be more pronounced than that observed in non-magnetized fluids, suggesting that magnetic fields may significantly enhance convective heat transfer. Despite the assumption to neglect spatial information such as density stratification -- an assumption that is necessary in the shell model approach -- our model captures the gross dynamical features of turbulent magnetoconvection in asymptotic regimes. It allows for a broad exploration of parameter space, indicating that magnetic fields may play a central role in modulating heat transport in stellar and planetary interiors.",

Oudmaijer 13 pages, 4 figures, to be published in the Astronomical Journal Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) This work presents a study of the evolution of the stellar accretion rates of pre-main-sequence intermediate-mass stars. We compare the accretion rate of the younger intermediate-mass T Tauri stars (IMTTSs) with the older Herbig stars into which they evolve. We find that the median accretion rate of IMTTSs (1.2$\\times$10$^{-8}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) is significantly lower than that of Herbig stars (1.9$\\times$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). This increase stands in stark contrast with canonical models of disk evolution that predict that the stellar accretion rate declines with age. We put forward a physically plausible scenario that accounts for the systematic increase of stellar accretion based on the increase of the effective temperature of the stars as they evolve towards the zero-age main sequence. For example, the temperature of a 2M$_{\\odot}$ star will increase from 4900~K in the IMTTS phase to 9100~K during the Herbig phase. Thus, the luminosity of the far ultraviolet (FUV) radiation will increase by orders of magnitude. We propose that this increase drives a higher stellar accretion rate. The scenario we propose to account for the increase in the stellar accretion rate solves the lifetime problem for Herbig disks because the increasing stellar accretion rates require lower initial disk masses to account for present-day disk masses. This work highlights the importance of the role FUV radiation has in driving the accretion rate, predicts a large population of pre-main-sequence non-accreting A stars, and has implications for interpreting disk morphologies that may serve as signposts of embedded gas giant planets in Herbig disks.",

Here, we present SPHINX II, which extends the model grid to cover mid-to-late type M-dwarfs, including both gray and physically motivated condensate cloud treatments and shorter convective mixing lengths. We validate SPHINX II using 39 benchmark FGK+M binary systems observed with SpeX IRTF (Mann et al. 2014) and apply it to 32 mid-to-late-type M-dwarfs from the SpeX Prism Library. SPHINX II yields improved fits that are statistically consistent with empirical benchmarks, achieving precisions of 0.078 dex in metallicity and 0.13 dex in C/O. Across the model grid, condensate cloud mass peaks between 2100-2400 K, decreasing sharply toward both cooler and hotter temperatures. We find the onset of the cloud-free regime around 2900 K, and below 2100 K, we see formation of deep/buried clouds. As a case study, we also model Trappist-1 and show that even mass-limited silicate grains subtly modify its emergent spectrum, suppressing near-infrared flux and reddening the mid-infrared slope via shallow cloud formation near 1e-2 bar. In sum, SPHINX II provides an improved framework for constraining the fundamental properties of mid-to-late M-dwarfs.",

While magnetic flux emergence and cancellation are widely recognized as key contributors to jet formation, the mechanisms behind repeated magnetic reconnection remain poorly understood. In this letter, we report a sequence of nine recurrent jets originating from active region AR 12715 during its decay phase, where the jet activity was associated with a complex distribution of fragmented magnetic flux. Non-linear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolations reveal the presence of low-lying, current-carrying loops beneath overarching open magnetic fields near the jet footpoints. These magnetic structures were perturbed by (i) emerging flux elements and (ii) interactions between oppositely polarized moving magnetic features (MMFs). To interpret these observations, we compare them with 3D radiative MHD simulation from the Bifrost model, which reproduce jet formation driven by interacting bipolar MMFs, leading to subsequent flux cancellation in the photosphere. Our results emphasize the critical role of MMF-driven flux interactions in initiating and sustaining recurrent jet activity in active regions.",

Phan, Lorenzo Matteini, Luca Franci Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The heliospheric current sheet (HCS) is an important large-scale structure of the heliosphere, and, for the first time, the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission enables us to study its properties statistically close to the Sun. We visually identify the 39 HCS crossings measured by PSP below 50~\\Rs~during encounters 6 to 21, and investigate the occurrence and properties of magnetic reconnection, the behavior of the spectral properties of the turbulent energy cascade, and the occurrence of kinetic instabilities at the HCS. We find that 82\\% of HCS crossings present signatures of reconnection jets, showing that the HCS is continuously reconnecting close to the Sun. The proportion of inward/outward jets depends on heliocentric distance, and the main HCS reconnection X-line has a higher probability of being located close to the Alfvén surface. We also observe a radial asymmetry in jet acceleration, where inward jets do not reach the local Alfvén speed, contrary to outward jets. We find that turbulence levels are enhanced in the ion kinetic range, consistent with the triggering of an inverse cascade by magnetic reconnection. Finally, we highlight the ubiquity of magnetic hole trains in the high $\\beta$ environment of the HCS, showing that the mirror mode instability plays a key role in regulating the ion temperature anisotropy in HCS reconnection. Our findings shed new light on the properties of magnetic reconnection in the high $\\beta$ plasma environment of the HCS, its interplay with the turbulent cascade and the role of the mirror mode instability.",

The combination of EUV and X-ray images and X-ray spectra allowed us to identify hot loops in the vicinity of the filament before its eruption. We interpreted their interaction with the rising filament as a signature of an arcade-to-rope reconnection geometry. The subsequent EUV brightening within the filament revealed helical structure of the erupting rope. We explained co-temporal radio slowly positively drifting bursts as a result of beam acceleration within the magnetic rope and propagation along the helical structure. Corresponding X-ray spectra were consistent with a thermal origin. The filament rising was accompanied by co-temporal normal and reverse drift type III radio bursts. We interpreted them as a signature of a reconnection event and estimated electron density at the reconnection site. Further untwisting of the helical structure led to formation of a quasi-circular EUV structure seen from Earth and STEREO-A. Its occurrence was co-temporal with a unique tangle of radio U- and inverse U-bursts. We proposed that several accelerated beams propagate within that complex structure and generate the burst tangle. During the start of the flare hard X-ray emission was concentrated near the filament leg only suggesting predominant propagation of the beams towards its rooting. We collected multi-wavelength observations indicating interaction of the erupting magnetic flux rope with the overlying arcade and internal magnetic reconnection inside the rising flux rope.",

Joyce Submitted to PASP, 11 figs, 5 tables, 26 pages Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present a systematic survey of strange mode pulsations in Cepheids using MESA and for the linear stability analysis, MESA RSP. Our model grid spans $2-15\\,M_\\odot$ in mass and [Fe/H] $= -0.95$-$0.17$ ($Z = 0.0015$-$0.0200$) in metallicity, with four convective overshoot prescriptions. Strange modes were identified in a relatively small fraction ($5-12.5$ %) of models, occurring at $n_\\mathrm{pg} = 5-9$, with $n_\\mathrm{pg} = 6$-$7$ as the most frequent radial modes. No unstable solutions were identified beyond $n_\\mathrm{pg} = 9$, in contrast to earlier studies reporting strange modes at $n_\\mathrm{pg} = 10-12$. We quantified the duration of the instability crossing phase ($\\tau_\\mathrm{IS}$), the strange mode phase ($\\tau_\\mathrm{s}$), and their ratio $\\mathcal{P}_\\mathrm{s} = \\tau_\\mathrm{s} / \\tau_\\mathrm{IS}$. Toward higher masses, both $\\tau_\\mathrm{IS}$ and $\\tau_\\mathrm{s}$ decrease, yet their ratio shows no systematic trend with mass in models that include convective core overshoot. The absolute timescales for strange modes remain short, typically $\\tau_\\mathrm{s} \\sim 10^{4.5}$-$10^{6}$ years, while $\\tau_\\mathrm{IS}$ is often an order of magnitude shorter, implying that these stars may spend a larger fraction of their life in the strange mode phase than in the instability strip itself. The extended duration of the strange mode phase may enhance the detectability of strange mode pulsators, provided that observational precision is sufficient to capture their low-amplitude variability. The predicted periods ($0.6-6.3$ days) are well covered by a single $27-$day TESS sector, making strange mode pulsators potentially detectable with current space-based photometry, although blending with nearby sources may pose challenges.",

Accepted for Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan (PASJ) Letter Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) A class of supernovae (SNe) termed `SN Ic-CSM' are characterized by late-time emergence of narrow emission lines of elements formed in the oxygen core of a massive star. A popular scenario is the interaction of the SN ejecta and O-rich circumstellar medium (CSM), i.e., Circumstellar Interaction (CSI). Uncovering the progenitor system of SNe Ic-CSM plays a critical role in understanding the final evolution of a massive star to a bare C+O star. In this Letter, we present observations of SN 2022esa which we show is an SN Ic-CSM. Surprisingly, a stable periodicity of ~32 days is found in its light-curve evolution with a hint of a slowly increasing period over ~200 days. We argue that the main power source is likely the interaction of the SN ejecta and O-rich CSM, while the energy input by the post-SN eccentric binary interaction within the SN ejecta is another possibility. In either case, we propose a massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) star as the progenitor, in a WR-WR or WR-BH (black hole) binary that will eventually evolve to a BH-BH binary. Specifically, in the CSI scenario, the progenitor system is an eccentric binary system with an orbital period of about a year, leading to the observed periodicity through the modulation in the CSM density structure. We also show that some other objects, superluminous SN I 2018ibb (a pair-instability SN candidate) and peculiar SN Ic 2022jli (the first example showing stable periodic modulation), show observational similarities to SNe Ic-CSM and may be categorized as SN Ic-CSM variants. Complemented with a large diversity in their light-curve evolution, we propose that SNe Ic-CSM (potentially linked to SNe Ibn/Icn) are a mixture of multiple channels that cover a range of properties in the progenitor star, the binary companion, and the binary orbit.",

López Ariste 16 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables. Accepted for publication in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We update the status of the spectropolarimetric campaign dedicated to characterise the magnetic field properties of a sample of known exoplanet-hosting stars included in the current target list of the $Ariel$ mission. We analysed spectropolarimetric data collected for 15 G-M type stars with Neo-Narval, HARPSpol, and SPIRou to assess the detectability of the large-scale magnetic field. For three stars we reconstructed the magnetic field topology and its temporal evolution via Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI). Such reconstructions were then used to perform 3D MHD simulations of the stellar wind and environment impinging on the hosted exoplanets. We detected the magnetic field of six stars. Of these, we performed ZDI reconstructions for the first time of TOI-1860 and DS Tuc A, and for the second time of HD 63433, providing temporal information of its large-scale magnetic field. Consistently with previous results on young ($\\rm\\sim 50-100~Myr$) solar-like stars, the large-scale magnetic field is moderately strong (30-60 G on average) and complex, with a significant fraction of magnetic energy in the toroidal component and high-order poloidal components. We found the orbit of TOI-1860 b to be almost completely sub-Alfvénic, the orbits of DS Tuc A b and HD 63433 d to be trans-Alfvénic, and the orbits of HD 63433 b and c to be super-Alfvénic. We obtained marginal detections of the magnetic field for TOI-836 and TOI-2076, and detections for TOI-1136, but the number of observations is not sufficient for magnetic mapping. A magnetic star-planet connection can occur for most of TOI-1860 b's orbit. This can happen more sporadically for DS Tuc A b and HD 63433 c given the lower fraction of their orbit in the sub-Alfvénic regime. The orbit of HD 63433 c is nevertheless more sub-Alfvénic than previously simulated owing to the temporal evolution of the stellar magnetic field.",

To trigger ZLK oscillations, however, a 3-body system must reach a sufficiently large mutual inclination between orbits. The occurrence of these high-mutual-inclination configurations can be curtailed by dissipative precession at the protoplanetary disk stage, which pushes exoplanet-hosting close binary systems toward preferential orbit-orbit alignment. In this work, we constrain the fraction of white dwarfs with binary companions that can undergo ZLK-driven pollution given the effects of dissipative precession. To accrete pollution via ZLK oscillations, a white dwarf binary system must be sufficiently inclined and the characteristic timescale of the oscillations must be sufficiently short to perturb material within the white dwarf's cooling age. Considering a sample of 4400 known white dwarf/main sequence binaries, we find that $50-70\\%$ have favorable parameters for ZLK pollution, depending on the orbital separation of the polluting body. While the conditions for oscillations are favorable, the tendency for ZLK to result in massive but more infrequent polluters likely restricts the rates of ZLK-induced pollution among the observed population. In general, dissipative precession is a limiting factor in pollution rates for more closely separated binaries (initial separations $<500-800$~au), while ZLK timescale constraints are most limiting for wider binaries.",

Keywords: Methods: statistical; Planets and satellites: composition; Planets and satellites: formation; Stars: abundances; planetary systems; Techniques: spectroscopic Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The well-known correlation between stellar metallicity and planet occurrence is strongest for giant planets, but weaker for smaller planets, suggesting that detailed elemental patterns beyond [Fe/H] may be relevant. Using abundances from the fourth data release of the GALAH spectroscopic survey, we analyzed 104 host stars with 141 confirmed transiting planets. We divide planets at 2.6 Earth radii, the theoretical threshold radius above which planets are unlikely to be pure-water worlds. We find that large-planet hosts are enriched by approximately 0.2 dex in iron and show a possible excess of highly volatile elements (C, N, O), though these measurements are affected by observational limitations, whereas small-planet hosts exhibit an enhanced contribution of the classical rock-forming elements (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) relative to iron, corresponding to a modest [Rock/Fe] offset of 0.06 dex, which is statistically significant, with a p value of 10^{-4}. These offsets remain significant for alternative radius cuts. A matched control sample of non-planet-host stars shows only weak and mostly statistically insignificant similar trends, confirming that the stronger chemical signatures are linked to the planetary characteristics. As our study relies on transiting planets, it mainly probes short-period systems (periods shorter than 100 days). These results refine the planet-metallicity relation, highlighting the role of the relative balance between iron, volatiles, and rock-forming elements in planet formation.",

Comments are welcome Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa), the thermonuclear explosions of C/O white dwarf stars in binary systems, are phenomena that remain poorly understood. The complexity of their progenitor systems, explosion physics and intrinsic diversity poses not only challenges for their understanding as astrophysical objects, but also for their standardization and use as cosmological probes. Near-infrared (NIR) observations offer a promising avenue for studying the physics of SNeIa and for reducing systematic uncertainties in distance estimations, as they exhibit lower dust extinction and smaller dispersion in peak luminosity than optical bands. Here, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to a sample of SNeIa with well-sampled NIR (YJH-band) light curves to identify the dominant components of their variability and constrain physical underlying properties. The theoretical models of Kasen2006 are used for the physical interpretation of the PCA components, where we found the 56Ni mass to describe the dominant variability. Other factors, such as mixing and metallicity, were found to contribute significantly as well. However, some differences are found between the components of the NIR bands which may be attributed to differences in the explosion aspects they each trace. Additionally, the PCA components are compared to various light-curve parameters, identifying strong correlations between some components and peak brightness in both the NIR and optical bands, particularly in the Y band. When applying PCA to NIR color curves, we found interesting correlations with the host-galaxy mass, where SNeIa with redder NIR colors are predominantly found in less massive galaxies. We also investigate the potential for improved standardization in the Y band by incorporating PCA coefficients as correction parameters, leading to a reduction in the scatter of the intrinsic luminosity of SNeIa.",

Martin Laming, Patrick Antolin, David M. Long, Deborah Baker Submitted to Philosophical Transactions A. Comments or criticisms welcome! Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Elemental abundances in solar flares are observed to vary both spatially and temporally, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. There is an interplay between advection and the preferential acceleration of low first ionization potential (FIP) elements that likely shapes the observed abundance distributions. Models of the FIP effect predict enhancements near loop footpoints that diffuse upward over time. We simulate strong evaporation events that advect this low-FIP enhancement into the corona. When the enhancement is sharply peaked, the corona does not become fractionated, exhibiting only a localized abundance peak near the loop apex that facilitates coronal rain formation. In contrast, a broad enhancement with relatively weak heating yields a uniformly fractionated corona, which is not sufficient for coronal rain formation. As the heating rate increases, the low-FIP enhanced plasma is increasingly compressed toward the loop apex, and rain is able to form. These results suggest a potential observational correlation between the presence and amount of coronal rain, the strength of flare heating, and the fractionation process itself.",

Here we develop a Lagrangian framework based on the Virial theorem to show that planetary orbital angular momentum modulates the Sun's rotation through barycentric dynamics, consistent with angular momentum conservation. Using Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) applied to sunspot number (SSN) and terrestrial length-of-day (LOD) records spanning the past 250 years, we identify two non-linear trends plus 11 common pseudo-cycles whose periods match those of planetary resonances (LR$^{*}$). We then demonstrate that a reduced nonlinear $\\alpha-\\Omega$ dynamo model, forced solely by the summed planetary right ascension RA(t), reproduces both the Schwabe cycle and its multi-decadal envelope, including the Dalton Minimum and the Modern Maximum. These results provide strong evidence, based on a physically-grounded model, that the solar dynamo is weakly forced by planetary motion, suggesting that the solar dynamo, classically viewed as autonomous, may in fact behave as a synchronized system.",

Turner Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We use the cyclic figure of merit to determine the likelihood of achieving cyclic deconvolution for 312 pulsars with sub-40 ms spin periods across 14 different telescope-observing frequency combinations. We find that the optimal frequency range for achieving cyclic deconvolution for most pulsars is between $\\sim$80$-$300 MHz, making low frequency observatories like uGMRT, LOFAR, and MWA the best-suited instruments for the technique. Moreover, we find that, as quantified by the total number sources with sufficient cyclic merits that are observed within the full deconvolution regime, uGMRT is likely the best current instrument for cyclic spectroscopy among the nine telescopes we considered, with LOFAR being the second best, and future telescopes like SKA-Low serving as the most likely eventual successors. The relatively high cyclic merit of the Crab Pulsar in the frequency ranges considered for GBT, MWA, LOFAR, and uGMRT suggests that some faster-spinning canonical pulsars may be able to achieve cyclic deconvolution, and we discuss potential follow-up analyses on other non-recycled pulsars. We conclude by advocating for near real-time cyclic spectroscopy backends to be considered for current and upcoming low frequency telescopes to increase the accessibility of this technique.",

      "abstract": "High-Precision Amplitude-Modulated Continuous-Wave Lunar Laser Ranging Slava G. Turyshev Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Lunar laser ranging (LLR) currently delivers mm-class tests of relativistic gravity and the lunar interior, but further gains are limited by photon-starved pulsed systems, array-induced pulse broadening, and atmospheric variability. Pushing into the sub-0.1mm regime is required to probe ultra-slow tidal dissipation, long-period librations, uHz-band gravitational waves. We develop a complete amplitude-modulated continuous-wave (AM-CW) framework for high-power LLR, including measurement models, estimators, a unified covariance description, and an observatory CONOPS. CW LLR is treated as RF phase metrology on a bright CW optical carrier: 2-way range and 1-way line-of-sight range-rate obtained from the phase and phase slope of a GHz-class modulation tone. The joint estimators are characterized by a covariance matrix decomposed into photon, atmospheric, instrumental, oscillator, nonlinearity contributions, mapped into subsystem requirements, including a closed-form range-rate bias from modulation-frequency slew across the ~2.56s round trip and synthetic-wavelength constraints on multi-tone nonlinearity. Using realistic photon budgets for a 1 kW, 1064 nm CW transmitter on a 1-m telescope ranging to 10cm corner-cube retroreflectors, we show that the photon-statistical floor for 2-way range at a GHz-class modulation frequency is at the level of a few-10 um in ~100s. With allocations to residual atmosphere and instrument, the resulting single-station 2-way precision is ~80 um, with range-rate sensitivities of ~0.1-1 um/s. Differential LLR between reflectors separated on the Moon by ~1000km can deliver 20-50 um and few (0.1-1) um/s differential range and range-rate. These precisions are realized across three representative regimes that span detected photon rates of (5-7) x 10^3-10^5 s^{-1} and are translated directly into hardware and CONOPS requirements for next-generation high-power AM-CW LLR.",

Motivated by the challenge, we developed Segmented-Polynomial-fitting Least Squares (SPLS), a new algorithm that simultaneously fits planetary transits and background trends using a segmented double polynomial model. Prior to signal detection, the optimal polynomial order for the trend component is selected using Bayes factor-based model comparison. During the periodogram search, the Signal Detection Efficiency metric is used to assess signal significance. The algorithm is accelerated by a three-step approximation and nonlinear parameter sampling tailored to SPLS. We compare the performance of SPLS with traditional detrending-detection approaches across different orbital periods, signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), planet radii and stellar noise levels on an injection-recovery test. When detecting signals with periods between 10 and 480 days and SNRs below 9, SPLS achieves at least a 22.6% higher true positive rate than other methods at the same 10% false positive rate. Using the threshold determined from the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis, our method also recovers the most true signals while yielding the fewest false positives among all injected samples, and reaches a 97% recovery fraction in Kepler confirmed single-planet systems. The tests demonstrate that SPLS improves the detection of transiting planets, particularly for low-SNR, long-period signals. It offers the potential for finding Earth twins in future applications to data from Kepler, TESS, and upcoming PLATO and Earth 2.0 missions.",

This leads to rising light pollution, which is known to have adverse effects on living organisms, including humans. We present a new software package to model light pollution from ground radiance measurements. The software is called Otus 3 and incorporates innovative ALAN diffusion models with different atmospheric profiles, cloud covers and urban emission functions. To date, light pollution modelling typically focused on calculating the zenith luminance of the skyglow produced by city lights. In Otus 3 we extend this and additionally model the horizontal illuminance on the ground, including the contributions from skyglow and the direct illumination. We applied Otus 3 to France using ground radiance data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). We calibrated our models using precise sky brightness measurements we obtained over 6 years at 139 different locations and make this dataset publicly available. We produced the first artificial illuminance map for France for the periods of 2013-2018 and 2019-2024. We found that the artificial ground illuminance in the middle of the night decreased by 23 % between these two periods, in stark contrast to the global trend.",

Despite these benefits, the trajectory optimization of spacecraft utilizing such configurations remains a complex challenge. This paper presents a sequential convex programming (SCP) approach for the optimal design of multi-mode and multi-propulsion spacecraft trajectories. The method extends the dynamical linearization within SCP using sparse automatic differentiation, enabling efficient inclusion of multiple propulsion modes or systems without complex manual reformulation while maintaining comparable computational efficiency. New constraint formulations are introduced to ensure selection of a single propulsion mode at each time step and limit the total number of modes used. The approach is demonstrated for (i) a low-thrust Earth-67P rendezvous using the SPT-140 thruster with 20 discrete modes, and (ii) an Earth-Mars transfer employing both a low-thrust engine and a solar sail. Results confirm that the proposed method can efficiently compute optimal trajectories for these scenarios.",

Kane, Pam Vervoort, Jonathan Horner 16 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The Milankovitch cycles of Earth result from gravitational interactions with other bodies in the Solar System. These interactions lead to slow changes in the orbit and angular momentum vector of Earth, and correspondingly influence Earth's climate evolution. Several studies have shown that Mars may play a significant role in these Milankovitch cycles, such as the 2.4 Myr eccentricity cycle related to perihelion precession dynamics. Here we provide the results of a detailed dynamical analysis that explores the Earth Milankovitch cycles as a function of the Martian mass to quantify the extent that Mars influences variations in Earth's orbital eccentricity, the longitude of perihelion, the longitude of the ascending node, and obliquity (axial tilt). Our results show that, although the 405 kyr long-eccentricity metronome driven by $g_2$ (Venus) and $g_5$ (Jupiter) persists at all Mars masses, the $\\sim$100 kyr short-eccentricity bands driven by $g_4$ (Mars) lengthen and gain power as Mars becomes more massive, consistent with enhanced coupling among inner-planet $g$-modes. The 2.4 Myr grand cycle is absent when Mars approaches zero mass, reflecting the movement of $g_4$ with the Martian mass. Meanwhile, Earth's obliquity cycles driven by $s_3$ (Earth) and $s_4$ (Mars) lengthen from the canonical $\\sim$41 kyr with increasing Mars mass, relocating to a dominant 45--55 kyr band when the mass of Mars is an order of magnitude larger than its present value. These results establish how Mars' mass controls the architecture of Earth's climate-forcing spectrum and that the Milankovitch spectrum of an Earth-like planet is a sensitive, interpretable probe of its planetary neighborhood.",

We carried out a sensitivity analysis to quantify the uncertainties in the abundances calculated by a state-of-the-art chemical atmosphere model of the widely observed planets WASP-33b, HD209458b, HD189733b, WASP-39b, GJ436b, and GJ1214b. We found that the abundance uncertainties in the observable atmosphere are relatively small, below one order of magnitude and in many cases below a factor of two, where vertical mixing is a comparable or even larger source of uncertainty than (photo)chemical kinetics. In general, planets with a composition close to chemical equilibrium have smaller abundance uncertainties than planets whose composition is dominated by photochemistry. Some molecules, such as H2O, CO, CO2, and SiO, show low abundance uncertainties, while others such as HCN, SO2, PH3, and TiO have more uncertain abundances. We identified several critical albeit poorly constrained processes involving S-, P-, Si-, and Ti-bearing species whose better characterization should lead to a global improvement in the accuracy of models. Some of these key processes are the three-body association reactions S + H2, Si + O, NH + N, and N2H2 + H; the chemical reactions S + OH --> SO + H, NS + NH2 --> H2S + N2, P + PH --> P2 + H, and N + NH3 --> N2H + H2; and the photodissociation of molecules such as P2, PH2, SiS, CH, and TiO.",

The group of authors decided to nevertheless make this work available to the community as pre-print Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) WASP-39b is one of the first extrasolar giant gas planets that has been observed within the JWST ERS program. Fundamental properties that may enable the link to exoplanet formation differ amongst retrieval methods, for example metallicity and mineral ratios. In this work, the formation of clouds in the atmosphere of WASP-39b is explored to investigate how inhomogeneous cloud properties (particle sizes, material composition, opacity) may be for this intermediately warm gaseous exoplanet. WASP-39b's atmosphere has a comparable day-night temperature median with sufficiently low temperatures that clouds may form globally. The presence of clouds on WASP-39b can explain observations without resorting to a high (> 100x solar) metallicity atmosphere for a reduced vertical mixing efficiency. The assessment of mineral ratios shows an under-depletion of S/O due to condensation compared to C/O, Mg/O, Si/O, Fe/O ratios. Vertical patchiness due to heterogeneous cloud composition challenges simple cloud models. An equal mixture of silicates and metal oxides is expected to characterise the cloud top. Further, optical properties of Fe and Mg silicates in the mid-infrared differ significantly which will impact the interpretation of JWST observations. We conclude that WASP-39b's atmosphere contains clouds and the underdepletion of S/O by atmospheric condensation processes suggest the use of sulphur gas species as a possible link to primordial element abundances. Over-simplified cloud models do not capture the complex nature of mixed-condensate clouds in exoplanet atmospheres. The clouds in the observable upper atmosphere of WASP-39b are a mixture of different silicates and metal oxides. The use of constant particles sizes and/or one-material cloud particles alone to interpret spectra may not be sufficient to capture the full complexity available through JWST observations.",

Miley Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We present the first detections of gas around a 2.1 Myr old debris disc-bearing intermediate-mass star, HD 44892. Gas is detected both in $^{12}$CO (2-1) emission through ALMA Band 6 observations and in absorption in Ca II K and H, seen with high-resolution UVES spectroscopy. $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O (2-1) are not detected. The star exhibits a 12 $\\mu$m fractional excess of $7.86^{+0.11}_{-2.27}$, placing it in the transition stage between protoplanetary and debris discs. Our detection of 1.3 mm emission yields the dust mass of 0.019$\\pm$0.009 $M_{\\oplus}$ assuming 115 K temperature. The $^{13}$CO non-detection places an upper limit on CO gas mass of $\\sim$10$^{-2}$ $M_{\\oplus}$. The $^{12}$CO detection yields a CO gas mass of (7.86$\\pm$2.05)$\\times$10$^{-5}$ $M_{\\oplus}$ or (1.62$\\pm$0.17)$\\times$10$^{-4}$ $M_{\\oplus}$ assuming a gas temperature of 20 K or 50 K, respectively. These should be considered as lower limits since $^{12}$CO emission may be optically thick. With UVES, we find variability in Ca II K and H lines, which can be interpreted by transiting circumstellar gas, ruling out interstellar absorption as their origin. Both the dust mass, which is within an order of magnitude of HD 141569, and the gas mass derived here indicate a late gas dispersal stage of the protoplanetary disc. Through our analysis we deem the alternative age of 800 Myr unlikely.",
