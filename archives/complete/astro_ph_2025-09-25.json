Comments welcome. Supplemental movie: this https URL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We demonstrate the formation of magnetically arrested minidisks (MAM) around equal-mass, nonspinning binary black holes with magnetohydrodynamic simulations of circumbinary disk accretion in full 3+1 general relativity. The initial separation of $d\\sim 30\\,M$ allows the black holes to host large minidisks that suppress the total rest-mass accretion rate variability, which is modulated primarily at $\\sim 1.6 \\, f_{\\rm orb}$. Each black hole horizon saturates with dimensionless magnetic flux $\\phi \\sim 30$. Magnetic reconnection near the horizons drives recurrent eruptions which are expected to drive flaring in the infrared and X-ray bands. Our results establish MAMs as a new outcome of circumbinary disk accretion, and a promising source of novel electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves from binary black holes.",

We perform general-relativistic simulations of BNS mergers using EOS models that span the uncertain high-density regime. We find a robust correlation between the ratio of energy and angular momentum lost during the late-time post-merger GW signal - the long ringdown - and the EOS at the highest densities in neutron star cores. Applying this correlation to post-merger GW signals reduces EOS uncertainty at several times saturation density, where no direct constraints currently exist.",

Here, we investigate the resonant interactions between binary black hole systems and solitons, self-gravitating configurations of ultralight bosonic dark matter, which induce metric perturbations and generate distinct oscillatory patterns in gravitational waves. Upcoming experiments such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna could detect the oscillatory patterns in gravitational waveforms, providing an evidence for solitons. Because the effect relies solely on gravity, it does not assume any coupling of the dark sector to Standard Model particles, highlighting the capability of future gravitational-wave surveys to probe dark matter.",

VI added. Accepted by PRD High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The strong gravitational field of a black hole bends light, forming multi-level images, yet extracting precise spacetime information from them remains challenging. In this study, we investigate how gravitational lensing leaves unique and detectable signatures in black hole movies using autocorrelation analysis. By examining the two-dimensional autocorrelation of a movie depicting a hotspot orbiting a Kerr black hole, as viewed by a near-axis observer, we identify a persistent secondary peak structure induced by gravitational lensing. Notably, these secondary peaks converge toward an approximately fixed point in the time-angle lag domain, largely independent of the orbital radius of the hotspot. This key property suggests that combining future flare observations with precise autocorrelation analysis could effectively disentangle lensing effects from orbital dynamics, enabling direct measurement of black hole parameters.",

Font Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Bosonic stars,hypothetical astrophysical entities, are generally categorized into two primary classes based on the nature of their constituent particles: Einstein Klein Gordon stars, made up of massive scalar bosons, and Proca stars, their vector ''cousins''. Depending on the boson masses and field frequencies, these objects may exhibit properties of diffuse, massive structures, with sizes comparable to or even exceeding those of galaxies. This concept has inspired the bosonic dark matter halo hypothesis, providing a theoretical framework to effectively model the dark matter content of galactic halos. In this paper we build on our previous work to explore the possibility of using vector and scalar bosons to model the components of galactic dark matter halos and subhalos in order to reproduce the observed rotation curves of galaxies. By employing diverse combinations of those bosonic dark matter models in conjunction with observable data for a sample of galaxies, we show that our two component dark matter approach notably improves the agreement between observations and theoretical predictions with respect to our previous investigation. Our framework may shed new light on the enduring mystery surrounding the apparent matter deficit observed in dwarf and spiral galaxies.",

Ground-based DFIs suffer from physical arm-length limitations, resulting in poor sensitivity at frequencies below 1 kHz. To address this, previous research introduced a neutron-based DFI, which replaces laser light with neutrons and achieves exceptional sensitivity down to a few hertz. In this study, we conducted a proof-of-principle experiment using a pulsed neutron source at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J- PARC). Despite practical constraints that led to deviations from the ideal experimental design, we optimized the setup and developed a novel analysis method that successfully cancels displacement noise while preserving simulated GW signals.

Lau, Priyamvada Natarajan, John ZuHone 24 pages, 14 figures, published in ApJ Astrophysical Journal, 991:56 (2025) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Galaxy clusters, the most massive, dark-matter-dominated, and most recently assembled structures in the Universe, are key tools for probing cosmology. However, uncertainties in scaling relations that connect cluster mass to observables like X-ray luminosity and temperature remain a significant challenge. In this paper, we present the results of an extensive investigation of 329 simulated clusters from Illustris TNG300 cosmological simulations. Our analysis involves cross-correlating dark matter and the hot X-ray-emitting gas, considering both the 3D and 2D projected distributions to account for projection effects. We demonstrate that this approach is highly effective in evaluating the dynamical state of these systems and validating the often-utilized assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, which is key for inferring cluster masses and constructing scaling relations. Our study revisits both the X-ray luminosity-mass and X-ray temperature-mass scaling relations, and demonstrates how the scatter in these relations correlates with the clusters' dynamical state. We demonstrate that matter-gas coherence enables the identification of an optimal set of relaxed clusters, reducing scatter in scaling relations by up to 40%. This innovative approach, which integrates higher-dimensional insights into scaling relations, might offer a new path to further reduce uncertainties in determining cosmological parameters from galaxy clusters.",

Submitted to A&A. \\mathtt{CHIMERA} is available at this https URL Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Gravitational wave observations can be combined with galaxy catalogs to constrain cosmology and test modified gravity theories using the standard siren method. However, galaxy catalogs are intrinsically incomplete due to observational limitations, potentially leaving host galaxies undetected and thereby weakening constraints or potentially introducing systematic errors. In this work, we present a self-consistent framework to study catalog incompleteness and host weighting effects, implemented in the publicly available CHIMERA pipeline. We obtain joint cosmological and astrophysical population constraints from 100 binary black hole (BBH) events in a LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O5-like configuration, using spectroscopic galaxy catalogs with varying completeness levels and stellar-mass host weighting schemes. We find percent-level constraints on $H_0$ with complete catalogs, reaching precision of 1.6%, 1.3%, and 0.9% for constant, linear, and quadratic mass weighting, respectively. As completeness decreases, the precision degrades following a sigmoid trend, with a threshold and steepness that increase for stronger weightings. Simultaneously, the correlation between $H_0$ and the BBH population mass scale also increases, making results more sensitive to assumptions about the astrophysical population. Remarkably, 2% precision remains achievable when catalogs contain only 50% of the potential host galaxies within the gravitational wave detection horizon, while 1% precision requires host probabilities scaling with stellar mass squared. The results are robust against host weighting mismodeling, even at moderate completeness levels. This work further highlights the importance of spectroscopic galaxy surveys in standard siren cosmology and provides a pathway for developing the science case of future facilities.",

Hotinli, Kendrick Smith, Marc Kamionkowski 11 pages, 3 figures. Comments are welcome! Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Recent advancements in small-scale observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have provided a unique opportunity to characterize the distribution of baryons in the outskirts of galaxies via stacking-based analyses of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. Such measurements, mathematically equivalent to probing the galaxy-electron cross-correlation, have revealed that gas is more extended than dark matter and that the strength of baryonic feedback may vary with halo mass and redshift. However, because these analyses are conditioned on galaxy positions, the inferred electron distributions remain biased by uncertain galaxy-halo modeling on small scales. In this work, we present a novel kSZ$\\times$galaxy four-point estimator that directly probes the full ionized electron field, extending beyond the gas traced by luminous galaxies. This method exploits large-scale velocity reconstruction from galaxy surveys to characterize the electron distribution unbiased by small-scale galaxy clustering. We forecast that the proposed signal can be measured with a signal-to-noise ratio of $\\sim3$ ($\\sim13$) for a configuration corresponding to Atacama Cosmology Telescope DR6 (Simons Observatory) CMB data combined with spectroscopic galaxy samples from DESI. This approach will enable the first tomographic measurements of the electron auto-power spectrum, providing new constraints on baryonic feedback and its role in shaping cosmic structure.",

These datasets, probing down to $k \\sim 6\\,h\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at $z = 2-5$, offer access to non-linear scales inaccessible to large-volume surveys like eBOSS.

Notably, this is achieved without external IGM temperature data, showing that XQ100 alone provides stronger constraints on thermal history than eBOSS DR14. In contrast, the KODIAQ-SQUAD P1D favors a significantly higher $A_P$ value, driven by the selection bias toward high-column density absorbers (HCDs). We also find that the P1D at $k > 0.045\\,\\mathrm{s/km}$ is more sensitive to Lyman limit system contamination and thermal history. When imposing a prior on $(A_P, n_P)$, the reduced $\\chi^2$ remains unchanged and the inferred mean IGM temperature is unaffected, suggesting that cosmological and thermal parameters are largely sensitive to different scales. The XQ100 P1D therefore provides complementary information on thermal nuisance parameters, which can be jointly fit with eBOSS or DESI P1D measurements to improve cosmological constraints.",

Lewis, Tara Murphy 13 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The cosmic dipole measured in surveys of cosmologically distant sources is generally found to be in disagreement with the kinematic expectation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This discrepancy represents severe tension with the Cosmological Principle and challenges the standard model of cosmology. Here, we present a Bayesian analysis of the tension between datasets used to measure the cosmic dipole. We examine the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer catalogue (CatWISE), and jointly analyse them with the Planck observations of the CMB. Under the kinematic interpretation, we find that Planck is in severe tension with CatWISE above 5$\\sigma$, strong tension with RACS, and moderate tension with NVSS. Moreover, the strong concordance between CatWISE and NVSS suggests that their dipoles arise from a common astrophysical signal. Conversely, the high discordance between RACS and both CatWISE and NVSS indicates a possible systematic difference in the RACS catalogue itself. Whilst the tension between Planck and infrared-selected quasars is already significant, the question of whether or not the dipole in individual radio surveys adds to the challenge against the standard model is yet to be seen. We estimate that $\\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ radio sources are required to measure the tension to a significance of 5$\\sigma$. Therefore, in light of the upcoming SKA radio surveys, we are on the cusp of disentangling the anomaly of the cosmic dipole.",

We present a comprehensive evaluation of all terms contributing to this cross-correlation, including both the transverse and longitudinal modes of the density-weighted velocity field, as well as all irreducible correlators that contribute to the momentum power spectrum.

Using this framework, we examine the impact of other commonly neglected contributions, such as the two-halo component of the dominant term, and the impact of satellite galaxies. Finally, we assess the sensitivity of upcoming CMB experiments to these effects and determine that they will be sensitive to the cross-term, the connected non-Gaussian trispectrum term, the two-halo contribution and impact of satellite galaxies, at a significance level of $\\sim 4-6 \\sigma$. On the other hand, the contribution from longitudinal modes is negligible in all cases. These results identify the astrophysical observables that must be accurately modelled to obtain unbiased constraints on cosmology and astrophysics from near-future kSZ measurements.",

Vikram 21 pages, 16 figures, submitted to MNRAS Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We measure the correspondence between the distribution of galaxies and matter around troughs and peaks in the projected galaxy density, by comparing \\texttt{redMaGiC} galaxies ($0.15<z<0.65$) to weak lensing mass maps from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 data release. We obtain stacked profiles, as a function of angle $\\theta$, of the galaxy density contrast $\\delta_{\\rm g}$ and the weak lensing convergence $\\kappa$, in the vicinity of these identified troughs and peaks, referred to as `void' and `cluster' superstructures. The ratio of the profiles depend mildly on $\\theta$, indicating good consistency between the profile shapes. We model the amplitude of this ratio using a function $F(\\boldsymbol{\\eta}, \\theta)$ that depends on cosmological parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\eta}$, scaled by the galaxy bias. We construct templates of $F(\\boldsymbol{\\eta}, \\theta)$ using a suite of $N$-body (`Gower Street') simulations forward-modelled with DES Y3-like noise and systematics. We discuss and quantify the caveats of using a linear bias model to create galaxy maps from the simulation dark matter shells. We measure the galaxy bias in three lens tomographic bins (near to far): $2.32^{+0.86}_{-0.27}, 2.18^{+0.86}_{-0.23}, 1.86^{+0.82}_{-0.23}$ for voids, and $2.46^{+0.73}_{-0.27}, 3.55^{+0.96}_{-0.55}, 4.27^{+0.36}_{-1.14}$ for clusters, assuming the best-fit \\textit{Planck} cosmology. Similar values with $\\sim0.1\\sigma$ shifts are obtained assuming the mean DES Y3 cosmology. The biases from troughs and peaks are broadly consistent, although a larger bias is derived for peaks, which is also larger than those measured from the DES Y3 $3\\times2$-point analysis. This method shows an interesting avenue for measuring field-level bias that can be applied to future lensing surveys.",

Jaffé 12 pages, 24 figures, accepted to A&A Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Given the mysterious nature of dark matter and dark energy, and the persistent tensions in cosmological data, it is worthwhile exploring more exotic physics in the dark sector, such as a momentum coupling between dark matter and dark energy, specifically in the form of a quintessence field. In this study, using collisionless N-body numerical simulations with a modified version of the RAMSES code, we follow up previous work to investigate the consequences of this model on dark matter halos and their substructures. We consider both the sign of the coupling and the imprints on structure formation and halo properties at a statistical level. We find that there is a clear enhancement (reduction) of substructure if the sign of the coupling is negative (positive) and that the dynamical state of the dark matter halos, particularly host halos, is undervirialised (overvirialised) at redshift zero when compared to uncoupled models or a reference $\\Lambda$CDM simulation. Furthermore, positive coupling leads to less concentrated, less cuspy halos, whereas negative coupling leads to the opposite.",

Amram, Q. Moysan, D. Russeil 20 pages, 12 figures. Accepted for publication in A&A, proofs version Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The formation process of galaxy groups is not yet fully understood. In particular, that of fossil groups (FGs) is still under debate. Due to the relative rarity of FGs, large samples of such objects are still missing. The present paper aims to analyse the properties of groups in various evolutionary stages (FGs, \"almost\" FGs, and non-FGs), and to increase the sample of FG candidates. We have spectroscopically observed galaxies in four groups and ten candidate FGs detected in the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey. We searched for substructures by applying the Serna-Gerbal dendrogram method to analyse the dynamical structure of each group. By applying the FIREFLY software to the continuum and PIPE_VIS to the emission lines, we derived the stellar population properties in various regions for each group. A roughly continuous variation in properties is found between a group that is still building up (XCLASS 1330), a well-formed massive group (MCG+00-27-023), a dynamically complex non-FG (NGC 4065), and a near-FG (NGC 4104). We also optically confirm two FGs in the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey, but their X-ray luminosity is still unknown. We observe that the lower the mass of the substructure, the more recent the stellar population in the considered groups. We also show an apparent lack of high-mass substructures for low-metallicity systems. These results are consistent with the generally adopted model of energy transfer during interactions of the galaxies with the group and cluster potential wells. Furthermore, the fossil status of a group might be related to the large-scale environment. Therefore, studying the positions of non-FGs, near-FGs, and FGs within the cosmic web can provide insights into the process of how fossil systems come into being in the Universe.",

However, similar studies on the atmospheres of lower mass systems, such as galaxy groups and giant ellipticals, remain limited. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of the chemical and multi-temperature structure of the intra-group medium (IGrM), using a subsample of nearby galaxy groups and ellipticals from the CHEERS catalogue. By comparing areas with and without AGN feedback related features, such as cavities or extended radio lobes, we find clear evidence of an excess of multi-phase gas along the path of recent AGN feedback. However, its distribution exceeds the length of the radio lobes, since we recover a non-negligible amount of multi-phase gas at larger radii. In contrast to the clear asymmetry in the thermal structure, we find no directional enhancement in the distribution of Fe, with little to no differences in the Fe abundances of the on- and off-lobe directions. Our analysis suggests that the metals in the IGrM of our targets are well-mixed and decoupled from the effects of recent AGN feedback, as indicated by radio-lobes and cavities.",

In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of {\\sc Imcom} hyperparameters on the quality of measurement results.

We then compare the results in terms of $12$ objective evaluation criteria, including internal diagnostics of {\\sc Imcom}, properties of coadded noise frames, measurements of injected point sources, and time consumption. We demonstrate that: i) the Cholesky kernel is the best known linear algebra strategy for {\\sc Imcom}, ii) in general, a wide Gaussian target output PSF outperforms a smoothed Airy disk or a narrow Gaussian, iii) kernel-specific settings are worth considering for future coaddition, and iv) {\\sc Imcom} experimental features studied in this work are either inconsequential or detrimental.

In this work, we present a machine learning-based framework using a UNet convolutional neural network to reconstruct the MTV fields from mock samples of the DESI bright galaxy survey within the redshift range $0.1 < z < 0.4$. Our approach accounts for realistic observational effects, including geometric selection, flux-limited data, and redshift space distortion (RSD) effects, thereby improving the fidelity of the reconstructed fields. Testing on mock galaxy catalogs generated from the Jiutian N-body simulation, our method achieves significant accuracy level. The reconstructed density field exhibits strong consistency with the true field, effectively eliminating most RSD effects and achieving a cross-correlation power spectrum coefficient greater than 0.985 on scales with $k < 0.1 \\, h \\, \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The velocity field reconstruction accurately captures large-scale coherent flows and small-scale turbulent features, exhibiting slopes of grid-to-grid relationships close to unity and scatter below $\\sim$100 $\\mathrm{km} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Additionally, the tidal field is reconstructed without bias, successfully recovering the features of the large-scale cosmic web, including clusters, filaments, sheets, and voids. Our results confirm that the proposed framework effectively captures the large-scale distribution and dynamics of dark matter while addressing key systematic challenges. These advancements provide a reliable and robust tool for analyzing current and future galaxy surveys, paving the way for new insights into cosmic structure formation and evolution.",

In particular, within the FLRW geometry, where dark matter is described by a dust fluid and dark energy by an ideal gas with a constant equation of state parameter, we introduce energy transfer between the two fluids. The effective cosmological fluid leads to a unified dynamical dark energy model with the feature that the Hubble function admits an analytic expression. We study this model using the DESI DR2 Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations data and the Supernova data from Pantheon+. The interacting model fits the data better than the $\\Lambda$CDM model, with $\\chi_{\\text{model}}^{2}-\\chi_{\\Lambda\\text{CDM}}^{2}=-5$. Using the Akaike Information Criterion to compare the two models, we derive $\\text{AIC}_{\\operatorname{model}}-\\text{AIC}_{\\Lambda\\text{CDM}}=-1$, from which we conclude that the interacting model is marginally better supported by the data than the $\\Lambda$CDM, but the difference is not statistically significant.",

Various dark matter candidates leave unique imprints on the low-mass range of the halo mass function, which can be challenging to detect. Among these are hot and warm dark matter models, which predict a reduced abundance of low-mass structures compared to the $\\Lambda$CDM model. Models with PBHs also affect this mass range, but in the opposite direction, producing an increase in low-mass objects. By examining lensing perturbations in galaxy clusters, constraints can be placed on the low-mass subhalo abundance and, therefore, on these different dark matter models. We aim to provide predictions useful for this type of perturbation in the PBH case. Additionally, we examine the abundance of haloes and subhaloes in the range where the stellar-to-halo mass relation rises steeply, which could be contrasted with brightness fluctuations in clusters caused by low-luminosity satellites. To do this, we run cosmological simulations using the {\\small SWIFT} code, comparing a fiducial model with alternative inflationary models, both with and without PBHs. We find a significant excess of substructure in the presence of PBHs compared to $\\Lambda$CDM, without altering the abundance of high-mass haloes at redshift zero. This increase reaches factors of $\\sim6$ for extended PBH mass functions with exponential cutoffs at $M_{\\rm PBH}=10^2M_\\odot$ in the range of parameter space where they could make up all of the dark matter, and persists even for sub-percent PBH fractions with cutoffs at $M_{\\rm PBH}=10^4M_\\odot$.",

This behavior enables it to model a variety of non-standard late-time cosmologies, offering alternatives to various dark energy (DE) models, especially when the DE sector violates the null energy condition. In this work, by fitting to CMB, BAO, and Supernovae (SNe) data and comparing models in a Bayesian approach, we show that simple models of exotic dark matter are statistically comparable to the $w_0w_a$CDM DE model in explaining the recent anomaly in the late-time cosmological evolution suggested by DESI and supernova observations, although in both classes of models the evidence against the $\\Lambda$CDM model only appears when the DES-Y5 or Union3 SNe dataset is included. The value of $H_0$ remains similar to that in the DE model, except in the no-SNe case, where the DE model predicts lower values than $\\Lambda$CDM, thereby worsening the Hubble tension, whereas the EDM models yield values closer to that of $\\Lambda$CDM, albeit with larger uncertainty. In addition, the EDM models predict a drastically different energy budget for the present-day universe compared to the standard model, and provide an explanation for a coincidence problem in the DE-model explanation of the DESI anomaly.",

We modify the lenspop package to produce a forecast for strong lensing in COSMOS-Web. We add a new mock galaxy catalogue to use as the source population, as well as the COSMOS-Web survey specifications, including the transmission data for the four NIRCam filters used. We forecast 107 strong lenses can be detected in COSMOS-Web across all bands, assuming complete subtraction of the lens galaxy light. The majority of the lenses are forecast to have small Einstein radii ($\\theta_{\\rm E} < 1$ arcsecond) and lie at redshifts between $0 < z <2$, whilst the source redshift distribution peaks at $z\\sim 3$ and has a long tail extending up to $z \\sim 11$, unambiguously showing that strong lensing in JWST can probe the entirety of the epoch of reionisation. We compare our forecast with the distributions of Einstein radii, lens photometric redshifts, and lens and source magnitudes in the observed lenses, finding that whilst the forecast and observed Einstein radii distributions match, the redshifts and magnitudes do not.

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The $\\gamma$-ray emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN), including both beamed blazars and misaligned-AGN, dominates the extragalactic $\\gamma$-ray point-source population count and flux. While multi-wavelength studies have detected an increasing number of AGN within dwarf galaxies in the local Universe, $\\gamma$-ray emission has so far only been associated with systems hosting supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Dwarf-galaxy AGN are of particular interest because their central black holes fall in the intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) regime, offering insight into the early evolution of SMBHs. Using 15~years of \\textit{Fermi}-LAT data, we present the first search for $\\gamma$-ray emission from dwarf-galaxy AGN. In the sample of 74 X-ray-selected dwarf-galaxy AGN, we find no sources that exceed the \\textit{Fermi}-LAT detection threshold. However, a joint-likelihood analysis reveals a modest, trials-corrected population-level excess ($\\sim2\\sigma$) above blank-field expectations at very soft photon indices $\\Gamma \\gtrsim 3.8$ above 500~MeV. This hint is most pronounced when source contributions are weighed by $M^\\alpha_{{\\rm IMBH},i}/d_i^2$, with $\\alpha\\simeq1$--$1.5$, suggesting -- but not confirming -- that $\\gamma$-ray emission could scale with the central black hole mass or a property correlated with it (e.g., accretion rate), but with a markedly softer spectrum than in SMBH-hosted AGN.",

Ressler, Luciano Combi, Bart Ripperda, Xinyu Li 23 pages, 13 figures, submitted to ApJL. Animations are available here: this https URL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) OJ 287 is the best-known supermassive black hole binary candidate in the nanohertz gravitational wave band. It exhibits periodic flares every $\\sim$ 12 years, likely caused by collisions of a smaller-mass secondary with the accretion disk surrounding a larger-mass primary. It is therefore an important benchmark for understanding black hole binary accretion in the approaching era of space-based gravitational wave detectors and large electromagnetic surveys. Because the electromagnetic emission of the system is determined by a complex interplay of plasma, accretion, and radiation physics in strong gravity, numerical simulations are required for realistic modeling. We present the first global, three-dimensional, general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of OJ 287-like systems; namely, smaller-mass secondaries colliding with a radiatively-cooled (thin) disk surrounding a larger-mass primary. We focus on disks with scale heights that are 10\\% of the distance from the primary and binary mass ratios of $q = 0.1,0.05$, and $0.025$ using an optically-thin cooling prescription. We confirm the basic paradigm that impacts of the secondary on the disk can generate enough power to outshine the quiescent emission. The secondary also causes spiral shocks to form in the disk, enhanced accretion events, overall heating of the flow, and stochastic tilting of the disk, though these effects are small for $q<0.05$. Our results can be extrapolated to the parameters of OJ 287 and similar systems, an important step on the path toward fully realistic simulations of accretion onto small-mass-ratio black hole binaries and predicting electromagnetic counterparts to low-frequency gravitational wave detections.",

Submitted to PRD High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Milky Way's galactic center is a highly dynamical, crowded environment. Gamma ray observations of this region, such as the excess of GeV scale gamma rays observed by Fermi LAT, have been of tremendous interest to both the high energy astrophysics and particle physics communities. However, nearly all past studies of gamma ray emission make simplifying assumptions about cosmic ray (CR) propagation that may not be valid in the galactic center. Recent numerical breakthroughs now enable fully time dependent dynamical evolution of CRs in magnetohydrodynamic simulations with resolved, multi phase small scale structure in the interstellar medium (ISM), allowing self consistent comparisons to the Milky Way cosmic ray spectrum. We model diffuse gamma ray emission from cosmic ray interactions for a set of Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations of Milky Way mass galaxies run with spectrally resolved cosmic ray spectra for multiple species at MeV to TeV energies. We find that the galactic center gamma ray spectrum can vary by order of magnitude amounts in normalization, and by approx. 10 percent in spectral slope at high energies, driven by both injection from highly variable star formation and losses from variable structure in the turbulent ISM. Gamma ray emission from inverse Compton scattering and relativistic nonthermal Bremsstrahlung is particularly variable on Myr timescales. We argue that features of the observed Milky Way gamma ray spectrum may arise from such transient phenomena in gamma rays produced from CR interactions.",

Where turbulent motions become supersonic, their interactions can lead to the formation of shocks, which are known to efficiently energize ions to cosmic-ray energies. We present 2.5-dimensional, hybrid-kinetic simulations of decaying, supersonic, non-relativistic turbulence in a collisionless plasma using the code dHybridR. Turbulence within these simulations is highly compressible; after accounting for this compression by taking the omni-directional power-spectrum of the density weighted velocity field, we find turbulent spectra with power-law slopes of $\\alpha \\approx -\\frac{5}{3}$ for low Mach numbers, in the inertial range, and $\\alpha \\approx -2$ for high Mach numbers. Ions embedded in the highly supersonic simulations are accelerated to non-thermal energies at efficiencies similar to those seen in shocks, despite being in a non-relativistic regime and lacking the large scale structure of a shock. We observe that particles are accelerated into a power-law spectrum, with a slope of $q \\approx 2.5$ in (non-relativistic) energy.

Studying pulsar emission at TeV energies allows us to understand the engines that power some of the most extreme accelerators in the Galaxy. We present recent highlights from the VERITAS pulsar program using nearly two decades of VERITAS data and novel high energy analysis techniques optimized for emission up to 100 TeV. This work begins to characterize how the emerging population of multi-TeV pulsars can be predicted from existing multi-wavelength observations. In particular, we highlight a search for VHE emission above 1 TeV using over 17 years of Crab pulsar data, which extends the high energy end of the existing VERITAS spectrum. Additionally, we search for both optical and multi-TeV emission from bright Vela-like pulsars, including analysis of over 200 hours of data on PSR J2229+6114, which powers the Boomerang pulsar wind nebula and is putatively associated with the ultra-high-energy source 1LHAASO J2229+5927u.

Those magnetic fields can act as lenses, altering their trajectories and (de)magnifying their apparent source images. These deflections of UHECR trajectories can lead to phenomena such as the appearance of multiple images of an extragalactic source. In this study, we investigate the influence of the Galactic Magnetic Field (GMF) on the propagation of UHECRs, considering four different realistic models for the GMF: the PT11, the JF12, the UF23, and the KST24 models. We investigate how an isotropic flux on Earth would have entered the edge of the Galaxy for different rigidity values from 1 to 100 EV. In addition, we investigate the appearance of multiple images of astrophysical point sources. Furthermore, we analyze the modification of the cosmic ray flux from a source as a function of the rigidity and its dependence on the chosen GMF model. Since the deflection induced by the magnetic field depends on the rigidity of the particle, the effects vary among different nuclear species. Consequently, our findings can have implications for interpreting mass-composition and anisotropy observations, as the rigidity-dependent deflections directly alter the observed UHECR arrival direction distribution.",

To enhance astrophysical realism, the study incorporates a multi-component galactic potential, modeling the influence of the surrounding stellar distribution, dark matter, and hot gas with the central blackhole. Our analysis reveals that the inclusion of the galactic potential induces subtle yet noteworthy shifts in the locations of sonic points. This effect is particularly pronounced in the vertical equilibrium disc model, where the region allowing for shock formation undergoes significant modification. The nature of critical points is determined by analyzing the eigenvalues of the corresponding stability matrix, establishing that multi-transonicity is restricted to a finite range of angular momentum. Shock strength and associated dynamic \\& thermodynamic quantities-such as mach number, pressure, density and temperature-are found to vary sensitively with galactic parameters, and are illustrated through comprehensive parametric plots. Additionally, a time-dependent linear perturbation analysis, demonstrates that the governing perturbation equations retain their structural form even in the presence of a galactic potential. The flows remain stable under adiabatic, radially propagating perturbations. Interestingly, the perturbative framework naturally gives rise to an emergent acoustic metric, identifying the system as a classical analogue of gravity. The corresponding acoustic surface gravity is analytically derived and shown to exhibit a dependence on both the spin of the black hole and the characteristics of the surrounding galactic environment.",

In this work, we search for DM-induced gamma-ray signals from Coma Berenices dwarf spheroidal galaxy (CBe dSph) using approximately 25 hours of observations carried out by the Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) Telescope, located at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, La Palma, Spain. Building upon preceding analyses in the gamma-ray regime, we extend the DM search into three dimensions by incorporating spatial information from the assumed DM-density distribution. This approach enhances sensitivity by leveraging both energy and spatial characteristics of the expected signal. The three-dimensional search for a faint signal necessitates the construction of a background model, leading to the proposal of the exclusion-rotation method. This method stacks all observations, excludes the source region, and corrects for the Azimuth-dependent acceptance of the telescopes by rotating the model. Furthermore, the open-source Python package TITRATE is presented, introducing Asimov datasets to the high-level analysis tool Gammapy for the approximation of the test statistic.

Using a relativistic mean-field framework with non-linear mesonic self-interactions constrained by nuclear data and astrophysical observations, we explore the DM parameter space spanning $m_\\chi \\in [0, 1000]~\\mathrm{GeV}$ and $q_f \\in [0, 0.06]~\\mathrm{GeV}$, generating over 30,000 equations of state (EoSs). Two representative hadronic EoSs are employed, a stiff (EoS1) and a soft (EoS18), with explicit inclusion of the crustal EoS. A multi-tiered statistical filtering scheme, combining voting, likelihood, and kernel density estimation scores, is applied using constraints from radio and X-ray pulsars, GW170817, and the low-mass compact object HESS J1731-347. We find that models satisfying the PSR J0614$-$3329 radius bound automatically comply with HESS, positioning ALP-mediated DM as a viable explanation for low-mass compact objects while still supporting $2\\,M_\\odot$ NSs. For the stiff EoS, we obtain $m_\\chi \\gtrsim 43~\\mathrm{GeV}$, with score-weighted posteriors favoring $q_f = 0.034^{+0.020}_{-0.012}$ and a broad allowed DM mass range $m_\\chi \\in [101, 949]~\\mathrm{GeV}$ (median $\\sim 466$ GeV). The soft EoS yields no strict lower bound, though large $m_\\chi$--$q_f$ combinations are disfavored. A high-precision supervised regression model built with AutoGluon achieves $R^2 > 0.998$ for inferring DM parameters from NS observables. Feature analysis reveals $m_\\chi$ is constrained by structural ratios such as $R_{1.6}/R_{1.4}$, whereas $q_f$ is set mainly by the tidal deformability $\\Lambda_{1.4}$.",

Its unique sensitivity, wide field of view, and rapid slewing capability make the CTAO especially suited to study transient astrophysical phenomena. The CTAO will analyse its data in real-time, responding to external science alerts on transient events and issuing its own. The Science Alert Generation (SAG) automated pipeline, a component of the Array Control and Data Acquisition (ACADA) software, is designed to detect and issue candidate science alerts. In this work, we present the current development status of SAG-SCI, the SAG component responsible for the real-time, high-level analysis of CTAO data. The SAG-SCI pipelines receive gamma-ray data from multiple reconstruction lines, merge them, store them in a database, and trigger several parallel scientific analyses on the latest data. These analyses include estimating target significance and flux, producing sky maps and light curves, and conducting blind searches for sources within the field of view. We execute SAG-SCI on a set of simulated gamma-ray data, detecting the simulated sources and accurately reconstructing their flux and position. We also estimate the systematic errors introduced by the analysis and discuss the results in relation to the generation of candidate science alerts.",

Russell, Ryan M. Shannon, Lei Zhang, Xingjiang Zhu Accepted for publication in PASA High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The millisecond pulsar PSR J1713+0747 is a high-priority target for pulsar timing array experiments due to its long-term timing stability, and bright, narrow pulse profile. In April 2021, PSR~J1713$+$0747 underwent a significant profile change event, observed by several telescopes worldwide. Using the broad-bandwidth and polarimetric fidelity of the Ultra-Wideband Low-frequency receiver on Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes radio telescope, we investigated the long-term spectro-polarimetric behaviour of this profile change in detail. We highlight the broad-bandwidth nature of the event, which exhibits frequency dependence that is inconsistent with cold-plasma propagation effects. We also find that spectral and temporal variations are stronger in one of the orthogonal polarisation modes than the other, and observe mild variations ($\\sim 3$ - $5\\,\\sigma$ significance) in circular polarisation above 1400 MHz following the event. However, the linear polarisation position angle remained remarkably stable in the profile leading edge throughout the event. With over three years of data post-event, we find that the profile has not yet recovered back to its original state, indicating a long-term asymptotic recovery, or a potential reconfiguration of the pulsar's magnetic field. These findings favour a magnetospheric origin of the profile change event over a line-of-sight propagation effect in the interstellar medium.",

      "abstract": "GRB X-ray plateaus as evidence that the afterglow begins before the prompt gamma-ray emission C. Guidorzi, R. Maccary, M. Maistrello, S. Kobayashi, M. Bulla, F. Frontera 8 pages, 4 figures, accepted by A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Most GRB X-ray afterglow light curves are characterised by a plateau, followed by a normal power-law decay interpreted as afterglow emission. Despite the numerous alternative interpretations, the origin of the plateau remains unclear. In the early years of Swift, it was suggested that the plateau might be afterglow radiation, that started before the prompt gamma-ray emission, and its time profile would be an artefact of assuming the start time of the prompt gamma-ray emission as zero time (the so-called \"prior activity model\"). We aim to test this scenario by leveraging the current Swift sample of early X-ray afterglows of GRBs with measured redshifts. We modelled the GRB rest-frame X-ray afterglow luminosities assuming a simple power-law with the true reference time preceding the prompt gamma-ray emission trigger time by T_0 and the X-ray luminosity L_0 at the trigger time as free parameters. For 90% GRBs of our sample, the model provided a successful description. In 10 cases the afterglow peak is identified and modelled appropriately. Using the 300 GRBs with accurate parameters' estimates, we confirm the anti-correlation between L_0 and T_0 with 0.7 dex scatter. In addition, selecting the subsample of 180 from the literature with reliable estimates of isotropic-equivalent energy E_gamma,iso, peak luminosity L_gamma,iso, and intrinsic peak energy E_p,i of the nuFnu spectrum of the prompt gamma-ray emission, we find a correlation between L_0, T_0, and E_gamma,iso (0.4 dex scatter) over nine decades in L_0 and common to all kinds of GRBs. The afterglow likely begins in most cases before the start of the detected prompt gamma-ray emission. As also suggested by the recent discoveries of Einstein Probe of X-ray emission starting long before the prompt gamma-rays, our results suggest that the occurrence of prior activity could be much more frequent than what has tacitly been assumed so far.",

However, the extreme neutron-rich conditions required for the r-process involve many nuclei that remain experimentally inaccessible, making theoretical predictions essential. We explore the impact of nuclear masses calculated with the ab initio valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group, focusing on the region around the N = 82 shell closure. We show that such ab initio mass calculations can refine the r-process predictions compared to global, but more phenomenological mass models. With the ab initio masses, the waiting point of the second r-process peak is strengthened, which leads to an overall slower nucleosynthesis flow, lower abundances of nuclei beyond the peak, and a stronger shift of the third r-process peak.",

Accepted into ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The Fe xxii doublet has been previously used to determine the density of collisionally ionized emission from magnetic cataclysmic variable stars. We test how this diagnostic doublet behaves for a photoionized plasma with an active galactic nucleus (AGN) spectral energy distribution (SED). We use the photoionized plasma code pion and ~440 ks of archival Chandra HETG for the well-known Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068 to test the behaviour of the Fe xxii doublet in the context of an AGN. This marks the first time these data have been examined with pion. We find that in a photoionized plasma, the Fe xxii doublet is dependent on the density, ionization state, and SED used. Thus, this density diagnostic remains model-dependent. In the context of NGC 1068 the doublet predicts an emission region ~100 rg from the central black hole. This would require a direct line of sight to the central engine, which is at odds with the Seyfert 2 nature of this source. In practice, these results highlight the complexities and challenges of applying photoionized models. With these data, we cannot exclude the possibility of a direct line of sight to the central engine of NGC 1068, but we cannot confirm it. Future observations with instruments such as Athena are needed to explore the Fe xxii doublet further.",

Barkov 9 pages, 7 figures, abstract abridged, submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) LS 5039 hosts a high-mass star, and a compact object that might be a strongly magnetized neutron star (NS). This scenario requires a mechanism to power its persistent and strong non-thermal emission. We investigate a mechanism in which the non-steady interaction structure of the stellar and the NS winds can regularly excite NS magnetospheric activity, releasing extra energy and fueling the source non-thermal emission. The NS wind shocked by the stellar wind can recurrently touch the NS magnetosphere, triggering magnetic instabilities whose growth can release extra energy into the NS wind in a cyclic manner. To illustrate and study the impact of these cycles on the two-wind interaction structure on different scales, we performed relativistic hydrodynamics simulations in 2D and 3D with periods of an enhanced power in the NS wind along the orbit. We also used analytical tools to characterize processes near the NS relevant for the non-thermal emission. As the NS wind termination shock touches the magnetosphere energy dissipation occurs, but the whole shocked two-wind structure is eventually driven away halting the extra energy injection. However, due to the corresponding drop in the NS wind ram pressure, the termination shock propagates back towards the magnetosphere, resuming the process. These activity cycles excite strong waves in the shocked flows, intensifying their mixing and the disruption of their spiral-like structure produced by orbital motion. Further downstream, the shocked winds can become a quasi-stable, relatively smooth flow. The recurrent interaction between the NS magnetosphere and shocked wind can fuel a relativistic outflow powerful enough to explain the non-thermal emission of LS 5039. A magnetospheric multipolar magnetic field much stronger than the dipolar one may provide the required energetics, and help to explain the lack of evidence of a recent supernova remnant.",

Earlier studies attributed these morphologies in these CCSNRs to shaping by jets in the framework of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). These dust morphologies suggest, in the framework of the JJEM, that exploding jets enhance dust formation in CCSNRs.

Revisions and the final version will be available at this https URL Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Stellar mergers are responsible for a large variety of astrophysical phenomena. They form blue straggler stars, give rise to spectacular transients, and produce some of the most massive stars in the Universe. Here, we focus on mergers from binary evolution and stellar collisions but do not cover mergers involving compact objects. We review how mergers come about, explain the physics and outcome of the merger process, discuss the evolution and ultimate fates of merged stars, and relate to observations. Our main conclusions are: (i) Mergers of main-sequence stars often fully rejuvenate and have interior structures similar to genuine single stars. (ii) Contrarily, mergers involving post-main-sequence stars can have interior structures that cannot be achieved by single-star evolution. Such merged stars may become long-lived blue supergiants that can explode in SN1987A-like events, interacting and superluminous supernovae, ultra-long gamma-ray bursts or collapse into very massive black holes. These black holes may even populate the pair-instability-supernova black-hole mass gap. (iii) Strong magnetic fields are produced in stellar mergers. Merged stars may thus be at the origin of some magnetic OBA stars and their descendants, highly magnetic white dwarfs and neutron stars. (iv) Initially, stellar merger products rotate rapidly, but there are several mechanisms that can quickly spin them down. Hence, merged stars may be rather slow rotators for most of their evolution.",

Tanaka, Koki Sakuta Submitted to ApJ. 12 pages, 3 tables and 3 figures Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We conducted a systematic spectral study for single F-type main-sequence (MS) stars without significant X-ray outbursts to investigate X-ray spectral properties such as temperature, emission measure (EM), and luminosity (Lx). To this end, 33 single stars with relatively rich X-ray photon statistics were selected by cross-matching large astronomical catalogs of the XMM-Newton source catalog and the Tycho-2 spectral type catalog. A positive correlation was found in the observed EM--EM-weighted temperature relationship as seen in late-type stars and it is also found in the relationship that our single F-type MS star samples have a plasma with an EM-weighted temperature of $\\lesssim$1 keV and an EM of $\\lesssim$10$^{53}$ cm$^{-3}$ corresponding to Lx of $\\lesssim$10$^{30}$~erg~s$^{-1}$. These observational features for the single F-type MS stars are consistent with those of the single G dwarf stars, suggesting that there are no significant differences in their X-ray coronal properties. Additionally, the obtained relationship between the X-ray activity and the Rossby number reinforces this suggestion in the literature. Moreover, the upper bounds in EM and Lx were found to be unique signatures for single stars and not valid for binary stars. Our results suggest that the planetary evolution in terms of the X-ray properties around F-type MS stars can be understood by extending the frameworks developed for G-type stars.",

To investigate the properties of Galactic CRs, it is important to determine the unmodulated local interstellar spectrum (LIS). Recent high-precision temporal measurements of CR energy spectra, released by the AMS-02 collaboration, provide a crucial observational foundation for this endeavor. In this study, we employ the widely used force-field approximation (FFA) model to analyze the AMS-02 data, and attempt to derive the LIS for CR protons and positrons. By applying a non-LIS method, we derive temporal variations of the relative solar modulation potential, $\\Delta\\phi$, for individual particle species. Our analysis demonstrates that the FFA provides sufficient accuracy in explaining the AMS-02 spectral measurements of all particles during the low solar activity period. Notably, the derived $\\Delta\\phi(t)$ for protons and positrons, as well as for electrons and antiprotons, exhibit excellent consistency, indicating that particles with the same charge sign can be effectively described within a unified FFA framework during the low solar activity period. Having established a well-constrained proton LIS and its associated modulation potential, we apply the common modulation behavior between positrons and protons to demodulate the AMS-02 positron measurements, and derive the positron LIS without necessitating prior knowledge of its characteristics. This LIS is useful for quantitative investigations into potential exotic origins of CR positrons.",

We assume a perturbative approach for the magnetic field deformation and that the dark matter only interacts gravitationally with hadronic matter. Assuming that dark matter is significantly softer than hadronic matter, we find that the magnetic field can affect dark matter through the deformation of space-time. The number of stars having a dark matter halo outside the visible surface of the star increases with an increase in dark matter fraction and the stiffness of the dark matter equation of state. As the magnetic field deforms the stars from sphericity, we can have a situation where we have a non-symmetric dark matter halo outside the star. The deformation of the dark matter halo gives rise to the discrepancies in the observed period $P$ (and period derivative $\\dot{P}$) and gravitational wave signatures. The observed visible surfaces predict a lower period and gravitational wave strain than that with a dark matter halo. This can have interesting observational gravitational signatures unique to magnetars having a dark matter halo.",

To enable precise spatial cross-identification, we constructed two high-precision catalogs: the updated 4FGL-Xiang-DR2 (DR2) and a supplementary version of the fifth edition of Roma-BZCAT (\\texttt{5BZCAT\\_err}). We then developed and applied a novel four-step analytical pipeline combining cross-matching with the statistical analysis of multi-band flux distributions to identify new Fermi blazars. The analytical pipeline has yielded several key results in the systematic comparison of BZBs and BZQs. We found that among single statistical metrics, kurtosis is the most powerful discriminator (MAD~$>$~1.64). At the overall distribution level, the 1.4~GHz, 843~MHz, 5~GHz, 0.1--2.4~keV, and 0.3--10~keV bands show significant divergence (JSD~$>$~0.3). Building on these findings, our proposed ``Box-Cox$+$TND'' model successfully fits the observed flux distributions between BZBs and BZQs. Applying this entire pipeline, we successfully identified 17 new blazars. The validity of these associations is strongly supported by our multi-wavelength flux model, which confirms that 15 of the 17 candidates are statistically consistent with the known blazar population, falling within the $2\\sigma$ confidence interval. Although the two remaining sources exhibit some statistical deviation in the gamma-ray band, their strong consistency in other wavebands, coupled with high spatial association probabilities, leads us to conclude that their associations are also reliable and should not be readily excluded.",

Accepted for publication in A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) IGR J17511-3057 was observed in a new outburst phase starting in February 2025 and lasting at least nine days. We investigated the spectral and temporal properties of IGR J17511-3057, aiming to characterise its current status and highlight possible long-term evolution of its properties. We analysed the available NICER and NuSTAR observations performed during the latest outburst of the source. We updated the ephemerides of the neutron star and compared them to previous outbursts to investigate its long-term evolution. We also performed spectral analysis of the broadband energy spectrum in different outburst phases, and investigated the time-resolved spectrum of the type-I X-ray burst event observed with NuSTAR. We detected X-ray pulsations at a frequency of around 245 Hz. The long-term evolution of the neutron star ephemerides suggests a spin-down derivative of about -2.3e-15 Hz/s, compatible with a rotation-powered phase while in quiescence. Moreover, the evolution of the orbital period and the time of the ascending node suggests a fast orbital shrinkage, which challenges the standard evolution scenario for this class of pulsars involving angular momentum loss via gravitational wave emission. The spectral analysis revealed a dominant power-law-like Comptonisation component, along with a thermal blackbody component, consistent with a hard state. Weak broad emission residuals around 6.6 keV suggest the presence of a K-alpha transition of neutral or He-like Fe originating from the inner region of the accretion disc. Self-consistent reflection models confirmed a moderate ionisation of the disc truncated at around (82-370) km from the neutron star. Finally, the study of the type-I X-ray burst revealed no signature of photospheric radius expansion. We found marginally significant burst oscillations during the rise and decay of the event, consistent with the neutron star spin frequency.",

Law 38 pages, 16 figures, submitted to AAS Journals. Comments welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Galaxies at Cosmic Noon (z$\\sim$2-3) are characterized by rapid star formation that will lead to significant metal enrichment in the interstellar medium (ISM). While much observational evidence suggests that these galaxies are chemically distinct from those in the local Universe, directly measuring the ISM chemistry in large samples of high-z galaxies is only now possible with the observational capabilities of JWST. In this first key paper of the CECILIA program, we present the direct-method physical conditions and multi-element abundances in twenty galaxies at Cosmic Noon. Using a combination of archival Keck/MOSFIRE and new $\\sim$30-hr NIRSpec spectroscopy, we measure multiple electron gas densities and the temperature structure from the O$^+$ and S$^{2+}$ ions. We find that n$_e$[O II] and n$_e$[S II] are comparable but elevated with respect to n$_e$ in local star-forming galaxies, and the simultaneous T$_e$[O II] and T$_e$[S III] generally agree with photoionization model T$_e$ scaling relations. The O abundances in the CECILIA galaxies range from 12+log(O/H)$=$7.76-8.78 (12-123% solar O/H), representing some of the highest direct-method metallicities and lowest T$_e$ measured with JWST to date. The CECILIA galaxies exhibit significantly sub-solar S/O and Ar/O, in agreement with emerging results from other high-z studies and a signature of predominant enrichment from core collapse supernovae. The N/O-O/H trends in the CECILIA galaxies generally agree with the abundance trends in local nebulae, but the large scatter in N/O could be sensitive to the star-formation history. The CECILIA observations underscore the need for exceptionally deep spectroscopy to unveil the ISM abundance patterns in high-z galaxies.",

We use the Cosmological and Astrophysics with Machine Learning Simulations (CAMELS) suite to explore variations on the Simba simulation AGN feedback model. The parameters explored include AGN momentum flux, AGN jet speed, supermassive black hole (SMBH) radiative efficiency, jet velocity threshold, and minimum SMBH mass needed to produce jet feedback. Although all parameters affect the P1D, this work explores the radiative efficiency, jet velocity threshold, and minimum SMBH mass in this context for the first time and finds the following results: Primarily, the most massive SMBHs impact the Ly$\\alpha$ forest through the jet feedback mode. While heating AGN jets to the virial temperature at injection aids in the removal of neutral hydrogen from the Ly$\\alpha$ forest, this heating also inhibits further jet feedback. Similar behaviors are seen when varying the SMBH radiative efficiency, with higher values resulting in a suppression of SMBH growth and thus a later reduction in AGN feedback and lower values directly reducing the impact of AGN feedback on the Ly$\\alpha$ forest P1D. These results imply that increasing the AGN feedback strength in the Simba simulation model suppresses the Ly$\\alpha$ forest P1D, but only if the feedback does not impact the number of massive jet producing BHs. Future studies of AGN feedback models will require careful exploration of the unique aspects of the specific subgrid model, and how they interact with one another, for a complete understanding of the potential astrophysical impacts of SMBH feedback.",

The iForest algorithm is an unsupervise Machine Learning (ML) technique. The data used is the spectroscopic and photometric data from GAMA DR4, which compiless information for over 300000 objects. We select two samples of galaxies to isolate, high signal-to-noise galaxies, to analyse the iForest's robustness, and E+A galaxies, to study the extremes of their population. This results in six-subsamples of spectroscopic, photometric and combined data isolations, finding 101 anomalous objects, half of which have not been identified as outliers in other works. We also find a number of fringing errors and false emission lines, displaying the iForest's potential in detecting these errors.

We propose two solutions to why these E+A galaxies are still star-forming but also question if these galaxies can be truly classified as E+A galaxies. We suggest that small-scale interactions on the galaxies causes small star bursts. The radiative pressure when forming high mass stars form expels the accreting material quicker than it can be accreted. We also suggest that the Jeans limit in our anomalous E+A galaxies is so low that it is simply not possible to form O and B class stars, but not low enough to fully prevent star-formation.",

In this paper we demonstrate, via a series of numerical experiments conducted in cosmological zoom-in simulations, that a likely pathway for this dust accumulation in the first formed galaxies is through production at early times via supernovae, followed by the rapid growth on ultrasmall dust grains. Our main results follow. The stellar production of dust dominates until z ~ 10-11 at which point galaxies transition to a growth-dominated regime. We employ a Shapley analysis to demonstrate that the local density is the dominant factor driving dust growth, followed by the grain size distribution. A rapid rise in the small-to-large grain ratio with decreasing redshift (owing to grain-grain shattering) drives growth through increased dust surface area per unit mass. Growth models are necessary to match the dust content of ALMA detected sources at z ~ 6. Finally, we demonstrate that ``blue monsters'', massive, UV-bright galaxies at $z>10$ with extremely blue continuum slopes likely have dust-to stellar mass ratios 10^-4-10^-3, but their top-heavy grain size distributions render them optically thin in the UV, providing a natural explanation for their observed properties without requiring exotic dust geometries.",

This study aims to improve chemical tagging by developing a method that leverages kinematic and age information to enhance clustering in chemical space, while remaining grounded in chemistry. We implement a graph attention auto-encoder that encodes stars as nodes with chemical features and connects them via edges based on orbital similarity and age.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We use a combination of self-supervised machine learning and visual classification to identify tidal features in a sample of 34,331 galaxies with stellar masses $\\log_{10}(M_{*}/\\rm{M}_{\\odot})\\geq9.5$ and redshift $z\\leq0.4$, drawn from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) optical imaging survey. We assemble the largest sample of 1646 galaxies with confirmed tidal features, finding a tidal feature fraction $f=0.06^{+0.05}_{-0.01}$. We analyse how the incidences of tidal features and the various classes of tidal features vary with host galaxy stellar mass, photometric redshift, and colour, as well as halo mass. We find an increasing relationship between tidal feature fraction and host galaxy stellar mass, and a decreasing relationship with redshift. We find more tidal features occurring in group environments with $12.0<\\log_{10}(M_{200}/\\rm{M}_{\\odot})<14.0$ than in the field or in denser, cluster environments. We also find that the central galaxies of the most massive ($\\log_{10}(M_{200}/\\rm{M}_{\\odot})>14.1$) groups and clusters exhibit higher rates of tidal features than the satellite galaxies. We find good agreement between the trends we observe and the results obtained from purely visual or other automated methods, confirming the validity of our methodology and that using machine learning can drastically reduce the workload of visual classifiers, having needed to visually classify less than 30 per cent of our sample. Such methods will be instrumental in classifying the millions of suitable galaxies to be observed by large upcoming imaging surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.",

Main text: 17 pages, 10 figures. Comments welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We study 24 massive quiescent galaxies with $\\log \\textrm{M}_*/\\textrm{M}_\\odot > 10$ at $1 < z < 3$ with JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution observations from the Early eXtragalactic Continuum and Emission Line Survey (EXCELS). We reconstruct their star formation histories and find that they have large bursts ($100\\textrm{ M}_{\\odot} \\textrm{yr}^{-1} -1000 \\textrm{ M}_{\\odot} \\textrm{yr}^{-1}$), followed by a rapid truncation of star formation. The number densities of the quenched galaxies in our sample that we predict underwent a submillimeter phase are consistent with submillimeter galaxies being the progenitors of our quenched population. The median post-starburst visibility time is $\\sim600$ Myr, with more massive galaxies ($\\log \\textrm{M}_*/\\textrm{M}_\\odot > 10.7$) exhibiting shorter visibility times than lower mass galaxies. The range of quenching times -- defined as the time from the peak starburst to the time of quiescence -- found in this sample ($0.06-1.75$ Gyr) suggests multiple quenching pathways, consistent with previous studies. We do not see evidence for quenching mechanisms varying with redshift between $1<z<3$. We detect evidence for weak AGN activity in 4 out of the 8 galaxies with robust emission line detections, based on line ratio diagnostics. Our findings suggest that there are a diverse range of quenching mechanisms at cosmic noon, and support a scenario in which the primary quenching mechanisms are rapid ($<500$ Myr) following a starburst.",

Meyer, Pascal Oesch, Sandro Tacchella, Alba Covelo-Paz, Emma Giovinazzo, Mengyuan Xiao 21 pages, 13 figures, submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) With JWST, it is now possible to use Lyman-Alpha (Ly$\\alpha$) emission from galaxies beyond z>8 to trace neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) as the Universe became reionized. However, observed Ly$\\alpha$ emission is scattered by neutral hydrogen in the IGM and the interstellar and circum-galactic medium, necessitating `baseline' models of Ly$\\alpha$ properties in the ionized IGM to disentangle their impacts. In this work, we characterize Ly$\\alpha$ properties at the end of reionization, z~5-6, providing a baseline that can be applied to z>6 observations. We targeted GOODS-N with MMT/Binospec, obtaining R~4360 rest-frame UV spectra of 236 galaxies at z~5-6, selected from HST/CANDELS, finding 62 Ly$\\alpha$ detections. We use JWST observations from JADES and FRESCO for a subset of our sources to characterize Ly$\\alpha$ properties as a function of UV continuum and H$\\alpha$ emission. We present the first statistical measurements of the Ly$\\alpha$ FWHM distribution at z~5-6, and produce empirical baseline models of Ly$\\alpha$ equivalent width (EWLy$\\alpha$) and escape fraction (f$_{esc}^{Ly\\alpha}$) conditional on UV magnitude and slope. We find our EWLy$\\alpha$ and f$_{esc}^{Ly\\alpha}$ models depend on UV magnitude, and infer 45$\\pm$5$\\%$ and <62$\\pm$8$\\%$ of MUV=-19.5 galaxies have EWLy$\\alpha$>25$Å$ and f$_{esc}^{Ly\\alpha}$>0.2, respectively. We find a mean Ly$\\alpha$ FWHM of 245km/s and median Ly$\\alpha$ velocity offset of 258km/s, both correlating with higher UV luminosity. Our median observed Ly$\\alpha$ line profile is broader and has higher velocity offset compared to pre-JWST models based on z~2 lines, which may reflect resonant scattering by residual neutral hydrogen in the IGM at z~5-6 and increasing ISM/CGM densities. Our median line profile predicts higher Ly$\\alpha$ transmission in a fully neutral IGM, providing insight into recent z>10 Ly$\\alpha$ detections.",

Sanz-Novo, V.M. Rivilla, J. García de la Concepción, I. Jiménez-Serra, J. Cernicharo Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The presence of molecular isomers in interstellar environments has become a topic of growing interest within the astrochemical community. Contrary to predictions based on thermodynamic equilibrium, recent observations reveal a diverse array of high-energy isomers and conformers. One of the most iconic molecular isomers detected in space, formic acid (HCOOH, FA), has been the focus of extensive theoretical research aimed at understanding its speciation into cis and trans conformers in dark clouds and photodissociation regions. In this work, we report the detection of c-FA, the higher-energy conformer, using ultrasensitive observations of TMC-1. This detection adds to previous findings in the Barnard-5 and L483 dark clouds. The derived trans-to-cis isomer ratio in TMC-1, 17.5, closely matches those observed in other sources, suggesting that the same chemical processes are at play across these environments. To investigate this, we conducted detailed astrochemical gas-grain models tailored to formic acid isomerism to explain the observed ratios. Our models successfully reproduce the observed trans/cis ratios and indicate that the presence of cis-formic acid can be attributed to the release of c-FA from grains, followed by isomerization driven by the excess energy released during the desorption process, a process that we name as isomerization upon desorption. The models also show that the isomerization of t-FA to c-FA in the gas phase is negligible at 10 K, meaning the observed ratios are a direct consequence of the formation pathways of both isomers on the surface of dust grains. However, at higher temperatures, quantum tunneling mediated direct isomerization in the gas becomes significant, and the ratios converge toward the thermodynamic equilibrium value.",

Bewketu Belete Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Resolved high-redshift galaxy gas kinematics is a rapidly evolving field driven by increasingly powerful instrumentation. However, the resolution and sensitivity still impose constraints on interpretation. We investigate the uncertainties inherent to high-$z$ galaxy kinematical analysis by modelling a suite of rotating disk galaxies, generating synthetic interferometric ALMA observations, and fitting them with the 3D-kinematical tools 3DBarolo, GalPaK3D, and Qubefit. We present the recovered 3D-fitted kinematical parameters to assess their reliability, quantify the range of values possible for individual source studies, and establish the systematic biases present for observed samples. The $V/\\sigma_{\\rm V}$ ratio, which indicates how dynamically cold a system is, is of particular importance and depends on the choice of 3D-fitting tool. On average, 3DBarolo and Qubefit slightly overestimates $V/\\sigma_{\\rm V}$ ($<1\\sigma$) and GalPaK3D underestimates it ($<2\\sigma$). Therefore, all three tools are reliable for kinematical studies of averages of high-redshift galaxy samples. The value range possible for individual sources is significant, however, even more so for samples of not purely rotation dominated sources. To determine whether an observed galaxy is rotation dominated enough to be fitted with a 3D-kinematical tool, $V/\\sigma_{\\rm V}$ can be extracted directly from the observed data cube, with some caveats. We recommend that the median offsets, value ranges, and tool-dependent biases presented in this paper are taken into account when interpreting 3D-fitted kinematics of observed high-redshift galaxies.",

Hensley, Desika Narayanan, Julia Roman-Duval, Evan D. Skillman 18 pages, 6 figures, submitted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We explore the physical origins of the observed deficit of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at sub-solar metallicity using JWST/NIRCam imaging of the nearby galaxy M101, covering regions from solar metallicity (Z$_{\\odot}$) down to 0.4 Z$_{\\odot}$. These maps are used to trace the radial evolution of the shortest-wavelength PAH feature at 3.3 $\\mu$m, which is emitted preferentially by the smallest PAHs ($<100$ carbon atoms). The fractional contribution of PAH 3.3 $\\mu$m to the total PAH luminosity ($\\Sigma$PAH) increases by 3x as metallicity declines, rising from $\\sim$1$\\%$ to $\\sim$3$\\%$ over the observed range, consistent with prior predictions from the inhibited grain growth model based on Spitzer spectroscopy. We explore model refinements including photon effects and alternative size evolution prescriptions, and find that a modest amount of small grain photo-destruction remains possible, provided the grain size cutoff does not exceed $\\sim55$ carbon atoms. The best-fit models predict 3.3 $\\mu$m/$\\Sigma$PAH will rise to $\\sim5.6-7.7\\%$ at 10$\\%$ Z$_{\\odot}$. Surprisingly, even as $\\Sigma$PAH drops significantly relative to the total infrared luminosity (TIR) as metallicity declines, 3.3 $\\mu$m/TIR alone rises, potentially indicating the mass fraction of the smallest PAH grains increases as the total dust content in galaxies drops. The current model cannot fully reproduce this trend even if the unusually strong effects of changing radiation field hardness on 3.3 $\\mu$m/TIR are included. This may be evidence that the smallest PAHs are uniquely robust against destruction and inhibited growth effects. These results highlight the pivotal role that short-wavelength PAH emission can play in studies of low-metallicity and high-redshift galaxies.",

An important, yet often neglected, role of gravity is its ability in driving anisotropic fragmentation through tides. When tides dominate, fragmentation becomes anisotropic, and the Jeans length along the short axis, $l_{\\rm tidal, Jeans}$, is approximately $\\sigma_{\\rm v}/\\sqrt{G \\rho_{\\rm mean}}$, determined by the external tides through the mean density $\\rho_{\\rm mean}$. We compare predictions of $l_{\\rm tidal, Jeans}$ against observational results in massive star-forming clumps, the Circumnuclear Disk (CND) around the supermassive black hole Sgr A* at the center of the Galaxy, the Central Molecular Zone in the Galactic Center, a hub-filament system, and a streamer around a young star. We find that the observed widths of these filamentary structures match theoretical predictions from tidally-controlled Jeans fragmentation. The formation of filaments can potentially shield cold gas against radiation pressure and photoevaporation, as well as hydrodynamical interaction with the ambient medium, potentially enabling the cold gas to survive. Thus, tidal forces are major players regulating gas transport around massive objects.",

Obtaining full 3D kinematic information is a crucial final step for modeling and interpretation. Molecular clouds are nurseries where stars are born. Stars at a very early stage, like young stellar objects (YSOs), inherit the spatial and kinematic structure of the gas patches they originate from. In this paper, we combine measurements of radial velocities towards the gas and the kinematic information of YSOs from Gaia DR3 to derive 3D velocities of a sample of YSO (Young Stellar Object)-MC (Molecular Cloud) complexes at d$\\lesssim$3.5kpc from the Sun. We find that the molecular interstellar medium traced by the YSO-MC complexes generally follows Galactic rotation, with an additional peculiar velocity of 8.6 km s$^{-1}$. The random motion of these complexes in the Galactic XY plane is more energetic than motion along the Z direction. A catalogue containing the 3D velocities of the YSO-MC complexes at different reference frames is available, and the distances and 3D velocities of well-known molecular clouds are presented. Our results set the foundation for exploring the interplay between the Galaxy, the molecular ISM, and star formation. Data available at this https URL.",

Krause Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The low-density region of the interstellar medium (ISM) where the Sun is located is known as the Local Bubble, a cavity filled with high-temperature and low-density plasma that may be created by a series of supernova (SN) explosions over the past 14 Myr. However, the effects of these SN explosions on the formation and evolution of the Local Bubble, as well as on nearby star formation, remain not fully understood. To study the expansion history of the Local Bubble, we use the kinematic data of the young stars obtained by cross-matching the pre-main-sequence (PMS) star catalog of \\citet{Zari2018} with the high-precision astrometric and photometric data from the {\\it Gaia} DR3 database. We perform a three-dimensional spatial clustering analysis on these young stars to identify star associations. We discover three unique star associations that exhibit a wiggle-like velocity pattern. The distances of these star associations are 108.5308, 141.5284, and 176.0318 pc, respectively. Their radial velocities in the Local Standard of Rest (LSR) are 10.0622, 5.4982, and 9.0581 km/s, showing a pattern of decreasing and then increasing. This velocity pattern, as predicted by \\citet{Krause&Diehl2014}, is caused by a recent re-acceleration affected by the SN explosion, reinforcing the picture of the Local Bubble as an evolving entity.",

We found indication for jet-induced ionised outflows within the HI hole but no molecular gas (upper limit of $M_{\\text{H$_2$}}<2\\times10^5\\text{ M$_\\odot$}$) is detected. The emerging picture is that the gas in the central regions has been rapidly depleted by the stellar bar or, despite its low power, the AGN in NGC 1371 is efficiently heating and/or removing the gas through the jets and possibly by radiative winds, leading to the inside-out quenching of the galaxy.",

Comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Gas-phase metallicity is a fundamental parameter that helps constrain the star-forming history and chemical evolution of a galaxy. Measuring electron temperature through auroral-to-strong line ratios is a direct approach to deriving metallicity. However, there is a longstanding discrepancy between metallicity measured through the direct method and that based on the photoionization models. This paper aims to verify and understand the discrepancies. We bin ~ 1.5 million spaxels from SDSS-IV MaNGA according to metallicity and ionization parameters derived from theoretical strong-line calibrations. We stack the spectra of spaxels within each bin and measure the flux of strong lines and faint auroral lines. Auroral lines for [OII], [SII], [OIII], and [SIII] are detected in the stacked spectra of most bins, and the [NII] auroral line is detected in fewer bins. We apply an empirical method to correct dust attenuation, which makes more realistic corrections for low ionization lines. We derive electron temperatures for these five ionic species and measure the oxygen and sulfur abundances using the direct method. We present the resulting abundance measurements and compare them with those model-calibrated strong-line abundances. The chemical abundances measured with the direct method are lower than those derived from the photoionization model, with a median of 0.09 dex. This discrepancy is smaller compared to the results based on other metallicity calibrations previously reported. However, we notice that the direct method could not account for the variation in ionization parameters, indicating that the precise calibration of metallicity using the direct method has yet to be fully realized. We report significant discrepancies between data and the photoionization model, which illustrates that the one-dimensional photoionization model is incapable of representing the complexity of real situations.",

The pipeline incorporates a grid of 24000 models, enabling robust fitting for both carbon- and oxygen-rich AGB stars. It calculates key physical parameters, including luminosity, optical depth, and mass-loss rate, and produces the corresponding best-fit SED plots. Using SEDust, we derived the specific mass-return rates for the galaxies NGC 147 and NGC 185. The specific mass-return rate of AGB stars in NGC 147 is $8.13 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, while in NGC 185 it is $6.52 \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$.

The present study takes advantage of the fact that the automated spectroscopic pipeline of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) occasionally assigns uncommon spectra to high-redshift QSOs. This paper presents an analysis of about 4000 spectra that are QSOs with redshifts z > 4.5 according to the spectroscopic pipeline of the SDSS DR16. It turns out that, after excluding non-classifiable spectra of low quality and those from three special plates, only 26 % are high-z QSOs, 50 % are QSOs at lower redshifts, 16 % are galaxies, and 8 % are stars. A significant proportion of the latter three categories prove to be unusual and are re-assigned here to a variety of rare types. The results of the re-evaluation are summarised in a catalogue.",

Submitted to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The relation between metallicity and galaxy mass (the so-called mass-metallicity relation) is the strongest and most prominent among scaling relations between chemical enrichment and galactic properties. However, it is unclear whether this relation primarily traces metal retention or the integrated production of metals, as past studies have obtained contrasting results. We investigate this issue through an extensive Random Forest and Partial Correlations analysis of spectral cubes of 4,500 galaxies from the MaNGA survey. We find that stellar mass ($\\rm M_*$) and baryonic gravitational potential ($\\rm \\Phi_* = M_*/R_e$) are the two most important quantities determining gas metallicity in galaxies. However, their relative roles strongly depend on the galactocentric radius -- the metallicity within 1~$\\rm R_e$ depends primarily on the stellar mass, while the metallicity at radii beyond 1.5~$\\rm R_e$ depends primarily on the gravitational potential. This finding can be interpreted in terms of metals in the central region ($\\rm R\\leq 1~R_e$) being mostly bound, regardless of the global gravitational potential and, therefore, the metallicity is determined primarily by the cumulative production of metals (hence the integrated star formation history, i.e. $\\rm M_*$); by contrast, in the galactic peripheries the retention of metals depends more critically on the gravitational potential, hence the stronger dependence of the metallicity on $\\rm \\Phi_*$ at large radii. Our finding reconciles apparent discrepancies between previous results. Finally, we find that the Star Formation Rate is the third most important parameter (after $\\rm M_*$ and $\\rm \\Phi_*$) in determining the metallicity, as expected from the Fundamental Metallicity Relation.",

The recent attention brought to sulfur-bearing molecules, as well as the recent detection of carbonic acid (H2CO3) in the interstellar medium (ISM), invites the study of the interstellar detection of the sulfur counterpart, thiocarbonic acid. However, the interstellar formation pathways of thiocarbonic acid have remained elusive. In this work, thiocarbonic acid was identified in the gas phase during the temperature programmed desorption (TPD) using isomer-selective single photoionization reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PI-ReToF-MS), suggesting that the hitherto astronomically unobserved thiocarbonic acid represents a promising candidate for future astronomical searches. The formation of H2CS3 isomers was investigated through additional isotopically labeled experiments and the formation mechanisms through quantum chemical studies. These findings unravel a key reaction pathway to thiocarbonic acid and represent a first step toward its possible formation and detection in the ISM, shedding light on the missing sulfur problem.",

We present the study of NSCs in 41 MATLAS survey dwarf galaxies including ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), as part of a large follow-up imaging program with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) using the F606W and F814W filters. The sample is biased towards low-surface brightness and large dwarfs, i.e., UDG-like galaxies, and includes two galaxies with a double nucleus, 13 newly identified nucleated dwarfs thanks to HST's high spatial resolution, and five candidate ultra-compact dwarf progenitors. We modeled the NSCs with a Sérsic profile and derived their structural properties and photometry. We find the NSC Sérsic index to increase with the luminosity and stellar mass, while no obvious trend is seen on the effective radius and ellipticity. The faint NSCs tend to have a constant color profile, whereas the bright ones have a bluer center, suggesting that the most massive NSCs in our sample might have experienced a mixed formation scenario, including in-situ star formation. A significant portion of our NSCs tend to be more massive than for other galaxy samples of similar stellar mass, which could be due to some dwarfs ongoing tidal disruption or an initial formation of massive NSCs from multiple GC mergers and in-situ star forming activity. More observations of resolved NSC are needed to be able to infer their formation scenario from the structural properties and photometry in dwarfs.",

Andersson, Mordecai-Mark Mac Low 10 pages, 7 figures, 1 appendix with 2 additional figures. Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics. Comments welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Galaxy evolution is sensitive to how stars inject feedback into their surroundings. In particular, stellar feedback from star clusters strongly affects gas motions and the baryonic cycle, with more massive clusters having stronger effects. Our previous results show that the star cluster mass distribution in dwarf galaxies depends on feedback, as strong pre-SN feedback, particularly ionizing radiation, results in fewer high-mass clusters. We investigate the mass distribution of gas clouds in dwarf galaxies. Since clusters form from collapsing gas clouds, we expect a similar feedback dependence in both distributions, so we hypothesize that pre-SN feedback yields fewer high-mass clouds. To test this, we use an isocontour analysis at cutoff densities of $10,\\ 10^{1.5},\\ 10^{2}$ cm$^{-3}$ to identify clouds in dwarf galaxy simulations run with the RAMSES adaptive mesh refinement code. We calculate mass distributions for models with different combinations of SNe, stellar winds, and ionizing radiation. We find that the mass distribution for clouds with $n>100$ cm$^{-3}$ is independent of feedback, but the distribution for complexes with $n>10$ cm$^{-3}$ is more top-heavy in the presence of radiation. Winds do not affect the distribution at any scale. This contradicts our hypothesis that cloud and cluster mass distributions respond similarly to feedback. Instead, the dense cloud mass function shows no feedback dependence, suggesting its shape is set by gravity. We conclude that the cluster mass function must be shaped by intra-cloud feedback regulating star formation and, in the case of radiation, effects on parent cloud temperature. (shortened)",

      "abstract": "Lyman-$α$ Escape through Anisotropic Media Silvia Almada Monter, Max Gronke, Seok-Jun Chang Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The escape of Lyman-$\\alpha$ (Ly$\\alpha$) radiation encodes valuable information on the neutral interstellar medium and is often used as a proxy for the escape of ionizing photons. Yet, the theory of Ly$\\alpha$ transfer through anisotropic gas distributions remains underdeveloped. We present Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations of Ly$\\alpha$ propagation through porous, inhomogeneous neutral gas, systematically exploring the effects of channel geometry, outflows, dust, and lognormally distributed column densities. We find that Ly$\\alpha$ photons do not preferentially escape through the lowest-column-density pathways, but instead traverse channels of substantial optical depth, leading to suppressed central flux and the absence of strongly beamed escape. Subdividing channels has little impact, indicating that geometry and covering fraction are more important than porosity. Channels containing moderate amounts of neutral hydrogen alter escape in characteristic ways, including the appearance of quadruple-peaked spectra, which can be captured by a simple flux-channel relation. Outflows reshape the spectra by facilitating escape through dense media, redshifting photons and blending central features, while dust modulates the visibility of small channels by suppressing flux at line center; in both cases, we develop an analytical model that predicts the resulting central fluxes. Extending to lognormal column density fields, we show that Ly$\\alpha$ photons probe a broad range of optical depths, producing skewed spectra that can be approximated by weighted sums of homogeneous models. Our results have direct implications for using Ly$\\alpha$ as a tracer of gas properties and ionizing photon escape; for instance, spectra suggestive of high column densities may nonetheless allow LyC leakage through narrow channels.",

Comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The spatial distribution of chemical elements in the Galactic disk provides key constraints on models of galaxy evolution. However, studies using planetary nebulae (PNe) as tracers have been historically limited by large uncertainties in their distances. To overcome the long-standing distance uncertainties, we recalibrated the H$\\alpha$ surface brightness-radius relation (Frew et al. 2016) with Gaia DR3 parallaxes, deriving statistical distances for 1,200 PNe and Bayesian distances for 419 objects with reliable parallaxes. Adopting Bayesian values preferentially, we determined the O/H radial gradient for 230 disk PNe. We tested three models: a single linear gradient, a segmented fit with one break, and a segmented fit with two breaks. Although model selection is statistically inconclusive, segmented fits indicate a change in slope near the solar radius ($R \\sim 8$ kpc), with a flatter or slightly positive gradient inward and a steeper negative gradient outward. This feature may reflect changes in star formation efficiency driven by the Galactic bar or the corotation resonance of the spiral arms. Comparison with other tracers - Cepheids, red giants, and open clusters - shows qualitative consistency. The two-dimensional O/H distribution in the Galactic plane supports the adopted distances and reveals modest azimuthal asymmetry, with enhanced abundances near the bar at positive longitudes, and a bimodal abundance structure between the inner and outer solar regions. Our results provide new constraints on the chemical evolution of the Milky Way, the impact of non-axisymmetric structures, and the possible existence of distinct radial abundance regimes across the Galactic disk.",

We use and apply three different machine learning methods to publicly available Dark Energy Survey data release 2 (DR2): a) Artificial Neural Network for photometric redshifts (ANNz2); b) Gaussian processes for photometric redshifts (GPz); and c) Keras, a deep learning application programming interface in Python. We compare these different techniques applied to training data obtained from the VIPERS survey. To deal with the incompleteness of the VIPERS catalogue, we use a space-partitioning data structure (K-d Tree) to estimate the reliability of the obtained photometric redshifts. We build a catalogue which is robust to the lack of training data in certain regions of colour space. We use the photometric data to create maps of overdensity as a function of the redshift distribution for more than 500 million galaxies. These maps split the sky into several onion-like redshift slices, which can be readily used for cosmological parameter estimation. On each angular slice, we create and present maps of the angular distribution of galaxies in that slice as well as an estimate of the redshift distribution, $n(z)$, related to the galaxy distribution of that slice, which is recovered from the redshift estimation methods. We achieve a sub-sample of DES galaxies, which are well matched to the VIPERS sample with an accuracy of the photometric redshifts with a $\\sigma_{68}\\sim0.035$ and a catastrophic outlier rate of the order of 3 per cent.",

This approach overcomes the inefficiency of particle neighbour searches or sorts across multiple GPU nodes by using a new ``particle-mesh-particle'' interaction scheme, which extends the particle-mesh method for self-gravity. The algorithm proceeds in two main stages: first, quantities exchanged between particles and the mesh -- such as mass, energy, and momentum added by stellar feedback or removed by accretion onto a sink -- are deposited into a buffer mesh equipped with ghost zones, where multiple contributions per cell are accumulated using atomic additions and then communicated across distributed memory ranks. In the second stage, the buffer states are applied to real mesh states, incorporating cell-wise limiters to enforce physical constraints such as positive density. We implement this scheme in the GPU-native radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code QUOKKA, demonstrating its application to both supernova feedback and sink particle accretion. We demonstrate that the former scheme converges in the terminal radial momentum from multiple supernovae across varying spatial resolutions, while for the latter simulations of accretion in several configurations show excellent agreement with analytic solutions. This scheme enables efficient, scalable particle-mesh coupling for GPU-optimized simulations.",

Interactive Figure will be made available with journal publication Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Star formation occurs within dusty molecular clouds that are then disrupted by stellar feedback. However, the timing and physical mechanisms that govern the transition from deeply embedded to exposed stars remain uncertain. Using the STARFORGE simulations, we analyze the evolution of ``embeddedness'', identifying what drives emergence. We find the transition from embedded to exposed is fast for individual stars, within 1.3 Myr after the star reaches its maximum mass. This rapid transition is dominated by massive stars, which accrete while remaining highly obscured until their feedback eventually balances, then overcomes, the local accretion. For these massive stars, their maximum mass is reached simultaneously with their emergence. Once these stars are revealed, their localized, pre-supernova feedback then impacts the cloud, driving gas clearance. Because massive stars dominate the luminosity, their fast, local evolution dominates the light emergence from the dust. We calculate the dependence of these processes on the mass of the cloud and find that emergence always depends on when massive stars form, which scales with the cloud's free-fall time. We also examine the evolution of dust emission and H$\\alpha$ luminosity. We find that dust dominates the luminosity for roughly 2 Myrs before stellar luminosity becomes more luminous. These results suggest that deeply embedded star-forming clusters tend to be rare compared to those partially exposed. Thus, because the initial embedding of the most luminous stars is highly local, the emergence of stars is a faster, earlier, more local event than the overall disruption of the cloud by gas expulsion.",

Mróz Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present observations and analyses of three high-magnification microlensing events: KMT-2022-BLG-0954, KMT-2024-BLG-0697, and MOA-2024-BLG-018. All three exhibit the \"Planet/Binary\" degeneracy, with planetary solutions corresponding to mass ratios in the range $-3.7 < \\log q < -2.2$, while the binary solutions yield $\\log q > -2.0$. For KMT-2022-BLG-0954, we identify a previously unrecognized degeneracy among planetary solutions, involving different mass ratios and normalized source radii. In all three cases, single-lens binary-source models are excluded. Bayesian analyses suggest that the planetary solutions correspond to gas giants orbiting M/K dwarfs beyond the snow line, while KMT-2022-BLG-0954 also admits an alternative interpretation as a super-Earth orbiting a late-type M dwarf. The binary solutions imply a diverse set of systems, including M-dwarf pairs and M-dwarf--brown-dwarf binaries. A review of known events subject to the \"Planet/Binary\" degeneracy shows that in most cases the degeneracy cannot be resolved through follow-up high-resolution imaging, particularly in the presence of the newly identified degeneracy.",

Pauwels 22 pages, 22 figures, submitted to A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Context. A key property of massive stars is their high degree of multiplicity, which can impact their evolution and end-of-life products. The Southern Massive Stars at High Angular Resolution survey (smash+) use interferometric and high-angular resolution techniques to detect companions at intermediate separations, from about 1 milli-arsec to 8\"), a domain that so far has remained largely unexplored. Aims. In this paper, we convert the angular separations and magnitude contrasts into physical units, i.e. projected physical separations and mass ratios. We also derive the sensitivity of the survey for various physical and orbital parameters. Methods. We develop a spectral-type/luminosity class -- H-band luminosity -- mass calibration based on existing grids of physical parameters of OBA stars and we use these to obtain the photometric distance to each system, correcting for all known companions within the 2MASS point-spread function. We also derive the individual masses of the primaries and of each detected companion. Results The probability of detecting companions is very uniform within the sensitivity limits of the \\smash\\ survey. The projected separations follow a flat power-law distribution in log-separation. The obtained mass ratios are compatible with the power-law distributions derived for spectroscopic binaries. Finally, we find a uniform mass-ratio distribution up to ~100 AU. Beyond ~100 AU, we observe a lack of equal-mass companions, with an upper mass-ratio limit declining towards larger separations.",

Accepted for publication in ApJS Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Near-ultraviolet (NUV) radiation from dwarf stars plays a critical role in shaping the habitability of planetary systems, yet its long-term evolution across different spectral types remains poorly investigated. Based on GALEX NUV observations, we study the evolution of stellar NUV emission for a sample of 386,500 A- to M-type dwarfs spanning ages from 3 Myr to 10 Gyr, drawn from both open clusters and the field. The normalized NUV emission ($f_{\\rm NUV}/f_{\\rm J}$) is used to trace the evolutionary trends. Our results reveal distinct evolutionary pathways after considering the distance completeness: A and early-F dwarfs show a weak decline in NUV emission during the main-sequence phase; late-F to G dwarfs exhibit a clear decrease, consistent with continuous spin-down driven by magnetic braking; late-K and M-dwarfs undergo a rapid decline in NUV emission when they evolve from young stellar objects to main-sequence stars. Furthermore, we construct the evolutionary tracks of stellar ultraviolet habitable zone (UHZ). By comparing stellar circumstellar habitable zone (CHZ) and UHZ, we find that G- and K-type stars offer the most stable overlap between thermal and UV habitability over long-term evolution.",

The coefficients of the main and weak r-process components are nearly constant for the sample stars, including s-rich stars. By accounting for the contribution of the s-process from low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars, the abundances of s-rich stars in M22 can also be fitted effectively.

Polsterer Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics on September 22nd, 2025 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Studies in the past few decades have investigated young stellar object evolution based on their spectral energy distribution (SED). The SED is heavily influenced not only by evolutionary stage, but also the morphology of the young star. This work is part of the NEMESIS project which is aiming to revisit star formation with the aid of machine learning techniques and provides the framework for this work. In a first effort towards a novel spectro-morphological classification we analyzed young stellar object morphologies and linked them to the currently used observational classes. Thereby we aim to lay the foundation for a spectro-morphological classification, and apply the insights learned in this study in a future, revisited classification scheme. We obtained archival high-resolution survey images from VISTA for approximately 10,000 literature young stellar object candidates towards the Orion star formation complex (OSFC). Utilizing a Self-Organizing map (SOM) algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning method, we created a grid of morphological prototypes from near- and mid-infrared images. Furthermore, we determined which prototypes are most representative of the different observational classes, derived from the infrared spectral index, via Bayesian inference. We present our grids of morphological prototypes of young stellar objects in the near-infrared, which were created purely from observational data. They are thus non-dependent on theoretical models. In addition, we show maps that indicate the probability for a prototype belonging to any of the observational classes. We find that SOMs created from near-infrared images are a useful tool, with limitations, to identify characteristic morphologies of young stellar objects in different evolutionary stages. This first step lays the foundation for a spectro-morphological classification of young stellar objects to be developed in the future.",

Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We analyze photometric observations of stars, which experienced microlensing events at the considered time, in order to compare the efficiency of detecting exoplanets in observations performed at thirteen different telescopes and with several approaches to the selection of observable events. In constructing an algorithm of the optimal selection of targets for these observations and in comparing the detection efficiencies for several telescopes, we considered models of the night-sky brightness that satisfy the data of infrared observations carried out in 2011 with the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) telescope and the RoboNet telescopes (FTS, FTN, and LT) used to search for planets with the microlensing method. The considered models of the night-sky brightness can be used for various observations (not only microlensing events). The time intervals, during which microlensing events can be observed, were determined with accounting for the positions of the Sun and the Moon and the other constraints on the telescope pointing. Our algorithm allows us to determine the already known microlensing events that are accessible for observation with a particular telescope and to select targets, for which the probability of detecting an exoplanet is maximal. The events, which would maximize the probability of detecting exoplanets, were selected for observations. The probability of detecting an exoplanet is usually proportional to the mirror diameter of a telescope. Telescopes with a wider field of view, such as the OGLE, are more effective in finding new microlensing events. To observe different microlensing events, it is usually better to use different nearby telescopes. However, all such telescopes are often better to use for observing the same event in those relatively short time intervals that correspond to the peak brightness of the event.",

Mojzsis, Marco Pignatari Submitted to The Astrophysical Journal, 13 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The light odd-Z elements P, Cl, K, and Sc are underproduced in galactic chemical evolution models compared to spectroscopic observations of stars in the Milky Way. The most promising solution to this puzzle is that some massive stars experience O-C shell mergers boosting their yields through dynamic, convective-reactive nucleosynthesis. We report how convective macro physics based on 3D $4\\pi$ hydrodynamic simulations impacts production in the O shell by post-processing the $\\mathrm{M_{ZAMS}}=15~\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ $Z=0.02$ model from the NuGrid dataset. We explore a mixing downturn, boosted velocities, reduced ingestion rate, and convective quenching. Across 24 mixing cases, the pre-explosive yields for [P/Fe], [Cl/Fe], [K/Fe], and [Sc/Fe] are modified by $[-0.33,0.23]~\\mathrm{dex}$, $[-0.84,0.64]~\\mathrm{dex}$, $[-0.78,1.48]~\\mathrm{dex}$, and $[-0.36,1.29]~\\mathrm{dex}$, respectively. Cases with a convective downturn with the fastest ingestion rate have the largest enhancement, and production is non-monotonic with boosted velocities. Which reactions are most important for the convective-reactive element production pathways depends on the mixing. We parameterize production of $^{40}\\mathrm{K}$ ($t_{1/2} = 1.248~\\mathrm{Gyr}$), an important radiogenic heat source for younger ($2{-}3~\\mathrm{Gyr}$) rocky planets and find a yield variation exceeding three orders of magnitude. This range of initial abundances for $^{40}\\mathrm{K}$ implies the early geodynamic behaviour of silicate mantles in rocky planets can differ greatly from that of Earth. These results underscore the importance of investigating the 3D macro physics of shell merger convection through hydrodynamic simulations to develop a predictive understanding of the origin and variability of the light odd-Z elements and the $^{40}\\mathrm{K}/\\mathrm{K}$ ratio in planet host stars.",

The high gas surface densities encourage vigorous star formation, which in turn couples with the gas to drive turbulence. We show that this coupling through momentum recoil drives 'baryon sloshing,' i.e. a random walk of the baryonic potential minimum with respect to the centre of the total gravitational potential, $\\Phi_{\\rm tot}$. The amplitude of the bulk motion depends on the strength of the feedback, which in turn is directly associated with $f_{\\rm gas}$. At its most extreme, when gas is the sole contributor to the disc potential ($f_{\\rm gas}=100$%), the amplitude of the walk can reach up to $R\\approx 5$ kpc and $\\vert z\\vert \\approx 1$ kpc within $\\Phi_{\\rm tot}(R,\\phi,z)$. Consistent with observations, the disc dominates over dark matter ($f_{\\rm disc}\\gtrsim 50$%) within $R_s=2.2 R_{\\rm disc}$, where $R_{\\rm disc}$ is the exponential disc scale length. For a lower $f_{\\rm disc}$ and/or $f_{\\rm gas}$, the 3D sloshing amplitude and velocity are reduced. The combination of strong feedback (which unbinds the disc) and sloshing leads to the newly formed stars being dynamically heated and settling to a more spatially extended disc population. The 3D heating process is isotropic but its effects are more noticeable in $\\vert z\\vert$ due to the initial dynamical coldness of the star-forming disc. Such a disc has enhanced [$\\alpha$/Fe] stellar abundances and a vertical (but no radial) gradient in stellar age and metallicity, both consistent with the Milky Way's thick stellar disc. Contrary to earlier claims, star formation in a stationary turbulent disc does $not$ produce thick stellar discs.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present new results on the spatial structure and kinematics of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of z ~ 2 star-forming galaxies drawn from the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey, using Lya and metallic ion absorption recorded in spectra of background galaxies whose sightlines are projected within ~ 30\" (physical distances D_tran < 250 kpc) of the foreground galaxy. The sample of 1033 foreground galaxies (<z_fg> = 2.03; 8 < log(M_star/M_sun) < 11) is probed by the spectra of 736 background galaxies obtained using Keck/KCWI (R ~ 1800) and Keck/LRIS (R ~ 1200). Using the galaxy pair ensemble, we present measurements of absorption strength (W_lambda) and line-of-sight velocity dispersion (sigma) as a function of D_tran, which together with \"down-the-barrel\" spectra of the foreground galaxies provide unprecedented maps of neutral hydrogen and ionized metals throughout the CGM of star-forming galaxies at \"cosmic noon\". A 2D map of Lya absorption depth (vs. line-of-sight velocity and D_tran) for the full ensemble shows a distinct transition near D_tran ~ 80 kpc (close to the virial radius of the average foreground galaxy) where the line-of-sight velocity dispersion reaches a minimum and beyond which the Lya absorption depth flattens. Splitting the sample into subsets based on foreground galaxy properties, we find a strong and monotonic correlation of both W_lambda(C IV) and sigma(C IV) with stellar mass (M_star) at all D_tran including DTB (i.e., D_tran ~ 0 - 250 kpc). Taken together, our results suggest that the kinematics, covering fraction, and spatial extent of CGM gas traced by Lya and (especially) CIV are modulated primarily by halo mass, and that a significant fraction of the CGM gas may be unbound.",

Green, Sergey Khoperskov, David Katz, Misha Haywood 15 pages, 1 table, 13 figures (including appendix), accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The presence of a 'butterfly' or a quadrupole structure in the stellar mean radial velocity ($<V_R>$) field of the Milky Way is well known from the Gaia and the APOGEE surveys. Past studies indicated that a stellar bar can excite such a quadrupole feature in the $< V_R >$ distribution. However, a systematic study investigating the co-evolution of bar and quadrupole structure is largely missing. Furthermore, whether this quadrupole structure in $<V_R>$ can be used as a robust kinematic diagnostic to constrain bar properties, particularly for the Milky Way, is still beyond our grasp. Here, we investigate the bar-induced quadrupole feature using a suite of isolated $N$-body models forming prominent bars and a sample of Milky Way-like barred galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological simulation. We demonstrate that the properties of the quadrupole (strength, length, and orientation) are strongly correlated with the bar properties, regardless of the choice of the thin/thick disc stars; thereby making the quadrupole feature an excellent kinematic diagnostic for constraining the bar properties. In presence of spirals, the estimator which takes into account the phase-angle of $m = 4$ Fourier moment, serves as a more appropriate estimator for measuring the length of the quadrupole. Further, we constructed a novel Gaia-like mock dataset from a simulated bar model while incorporating the dust extinction and the broad trends of observational errors of the Gaia survey. The quadrupole properties (strength and length) estimated from those Gaia-like mock data are larger ($\\sim 35-45$ percent) when compared with their true values. We showed that the majority of this effect is due to the uncertainty in parallax measurement. This demonstrates that the quadrupole structure in Gaia data is likely a result of dominant Gaia parallax errors/biases, almost masking the true inherent signature of the MW bar.",

Fox, Matthias Steinmetz 13 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, accepted to ApJ; v2 updated to match Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We identify and investigate a pre-infall analog of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC, SMC) in the HESTIA suite of constrained cosmological simulations. The system, dynamically isolated from the Local Group, evolves over ~6 Gyr and forms a multiphase warm coronal halo and a neutral gas stream via repeated tidal interactions, ~150 kpc in length. The LMC-analog's corona forms self-consistently through virial accretion and inhibits the survival of clumpy neutral structures beyond ~600 Myr. The SMC analog remains bound through to z=0, and the pair also exhibits bridge-like and leading-arm features. These results suggest that while most of the ionized Stream is formed by the LMC coronal gas, the neutral gas stream, bridge, and leading arm components of the Magellanic System can arise from dwarf-dwarf interactions prior to infall, while the survival and ionization of these features likely require additional environmental processing. Furthermore, we identify a stellar component out of phase to the neutral component of the stream, implying that if the Magellanic stellar stream exists, it may not be spatially coexistent to the dominant H I stream. This system offers a valuable pre-infall reference point for interpreting the Magellanic System and identifying analogs beyond the Local Group.",

Oesch, Rhea-Silvia Remus 63 pages, with 27 figures, accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present the morphological properties of 17 spectroscopically confirmed massive quiescent galaxies ($10.2 < \\log(M_{\\ast}/M_{\\odot}) < 11.2$) at $3.0 < z < 4.3$, observed with JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam. Using Sérsic profile fits to F277W and F444W imaging, we derive the size--mass relation and find typical sizes of $\\sim$0.6--0.8 kpc at $M_{\\ast} = 5 \\times 10^{10}~M_{\\odot}$, consistent with $\\sim$7$\\times$ growth from $z \\sim 4$ to the present, including $\\sim$2$\\times$ by $z \\sim 2$. We find tentative evidence that formation history and morphology jointly influence galaxy sizes: late-forming bulge-dominated galaxies appear more compact by $\\sim$0.2--0.3 dex relative to the expected relation, while late-forming disk-dominated galaxies are larger. Using a random forest regressor, we identify local environmental density, quantified by $\\log(1+\\delta^{\\prime}_{3})$ from the three nearest neighbors, as the strongest predictor of bulge-to-total ratio ($B/T$), which spans 0.25--1. In the {\\sc IllustrisTNG} simulation, the ex-situ stellar mass fraction ($f_{\\ast,\\mathrm{ex\\text{-}situ}}$) -- a proxy for mergers -- is instead the dominant predictor of $B/T$. Galaxies with high $B/T$ in dense environments show bursty star formation and short quenching timescales ($\\lesssim0.4$ Gyr), consistent with bulge growth through merger-driven starbursts; in simulations, such systems exhibit elevated ex-situ fractions ($\\sim$20--30\\%). In contrast, some high-$B/T$ galaxies in intermediate-density environments have low ex-situ fractions, suggesting that additional processes -- such as violent disk instabilities -- also contribute. These results point to multiple bulge growth pathways at high redshift, unified by rapid gas accretion, central starbursts, and AGN feedback, as predicted by cosmological simulations.",

For summary video, please see this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate how differences in the stellar feedback produce disks with different morphologies in Milky Way-like progenitors over 1 $\\leq z \\leq 5$, using eight state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamics simulation codes in the \\textit{AGORA} project. In three of the participating codes, a distinct, rotation-dominated inner core emerges with a formation timescale of $\\lesssim 300$ Myr, largely driven by a major merger event, while two other codes exhibit similar signs of wet compaction -- gaseous shrinkage into a compact starburst phase -- at earlier epochs. The remaining three codes show only weak evidence of wet compaction. Consequently, we divide the simulated galaxies into two groups: those with strong compaction signatures and those with weaker ones. Galaxies in these two groups differ in size, stellar age gradients, and disk-to-total mass ratios. Specifically, codes with strong wet compaction build their outer disks in an inside-out fashion, leading to negative age gradients, whereas codes with weaker compaction feature flat or positive age gradients caused primarily by outward stellar migration. Although the stellar half-mass radii of these two groups diverge at $z \\sim 3$, the inclusion of dust extinction brings their sizes and shapes in mock observations closer to each other and to observed galaxies. We attribute the observed morphological differences primarily to variations in the stellar feedback implementations -- such as delayed cooling timescales, and feedback strengths -- that regulate both the onset and duration of compaction. Overall, our results suggest that disk assembly at high redshifts is highly sensitive to the details of the stellar feedback prescriptions in simulations.",

Simcoe Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Ionized proximity zones around luminous quasars provide a unique laboratory to characterize the Ly$\\alpha$ emission lines from $z>6$ galaxies without significant attenuation from the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, Ly$\\alpha$ line measurements for galaxies within high-redshift quasars' proximity zones have been rare so far. Here we present deep spectroscopic observations obtained with the NIRSpec/MSA instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of galaxies in two $z>6$ quasar fields. We measure the Ly$\\alpha$ line fluxes for 50 galaxies at $6<z<7$ with UV absolute magnitude $M_\\text{UV}<-19$ (median $M_\\text{UV}=-19.97$), among which 15 are located near the luminous quasars, i.e. within $\\Delta v<2500\\rm\\,km\\,s^{-1}$. We find that galaxies near the quasars show significant flux bluewards of the systemic Ly$\\alpha$ wavelength, and have higher Ly$\\alpha$ equivalent width compared to galaxies at similar redshifts that are not located within the quasars' environment. Our result indicates little or no redshift evolution for the Ly$\\alpha$-emitter fraction from $z\\sim6.4$ to $z\\sim5$. Leveraging the low IGM opacity in the quasars' vicinity, we evaluate the Ly$\\alpha$ escape fraction ($f_\\text{esc}^{\\text{Ly}\\alpha}$) of high-redshift galaxies. Our analysis suggests that galaxies at $\\langle z\\rangle\\approx6.4$ have an average $f_\\text{esc}^{\\text{Ly}\\alpha}=0.14\\pm0.04$. This value is consistent with reionization models where the Lyman continuum escape fraction is low $(f_\\text{esc}^\\text{LyC}\\lesssim0.1)$ for luminous galaxies, and where the most luminous galaxies have only a minor contribution to the total ionizing photon budget.",

We analyze cluster mass, age, size, concentration, and fractal structure using the Q parameter and the fractal dimension fdim, and examine their correlations with key physical parameters. Our results reveal systematic environmental trends: clusters in groups are generally younger, less massive, slightly larger, and less centrally concentrated than those in pairs or singles. Fractality is more pronounced in clusters within pairs and groups, with 44% of group clusters exhibiting fractal substructure compared to 38.5% for pairs and 33.2% for singles. Similarly, median fdim values increase from singles (1.13) to pairs (1.16) to groups (1.25), reflecting greater substructure in denser environments. These findings indicate that both intrinsic cluster properties and environmental context significantly influence cluster evolution. More massive clusters tend to evolve toward centrally concentrated, radially symmetric configurations, while less massive clusters retain fractal features for longer periods. Overall, our study demonstrates that open clusters do not evolve in isolation: interactions with the environment play a critical role in shaping their structural evolution and dynamical state.",

Haugan, W. Holmes, I. M. Hook, F. Hormuth Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Cosmological models of hierarchical structure formation predict the existence of a widespread population of dual accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on kpc-scale separations, corresponding to projected distances < 0\".8 at redshifts higher than 0.5. However, close companions to known active galactic nuclei (AGN) or quasars (QSOs) can also be multiple images of the object itself, strongly lensed by a foreground galaxy, as well as foreground stars in a chance superposition. Thanks to its large sky coverage, sensitivity, and high spatial resolution, Euclid offers a unique opportunity to obtain a large, homogeneous sample of dual/lensed AGN candidates with sub-arcsec projected separations. Here we present a machine learning approach, in particular a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to identify close companions to known QSOs down to separations of $\\sim\\,$0\".15 comparable to the Euclid VIS point spread function (PSF). We studied the effectiveness of the CNN in identifying dual AGN and demonstrated that it outperforms traditional techniques. Applying our CNN to a sample of $\\sim\\,$6000 QSOs from the Q1 Euclid data release, we find a fraction of about 0.25% dual AGN candidates with separation $\\sim\\,$0\".4 (corresponding to $\\sim$3 kpc at z=1). Estimating the foreground contamination from stellar objects, we find that most of the pair candidates with separation higher than 0\".5 are likely contaminants, while below this limit, contamination is expected to be less than 20%. For objects at higher separation (>0\".5, i.e. 4 kpc at z=1), we performed PSF subtraction and used colour-colour diagrams to constrain their nature. We present a first set of dual/lensed AGN candidates detected in the Q1 Euclid data, providing a starting point for the analysis of future data releases.",

Comments most welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) It has been suggested that, if the free-fall time of star-forming clouds is shorter than the lifetime ($\\approx 3 $ Myr) of massive stars exploding as supernovae (SN), a large fraction of the cloud gas can be converted into stars during an allegedly `feedback-free' phase. Here, we show that radiation pressure from Ly$\\alpha$ photons produced in the pre-SN phase can instead erase feedback-free conditions, and severely limit the star formation efficiency (SFE). We find that, for a constant star formation rate, all clouds with gas surface density $(37-1.7 \\times 10^5)\\ M_\\odot\\ \\rm pc^{-2}$ have $\\epsilon_* < 0.08$. Higher SFE values can only be reached if Ly$\\alpha$-driven shells fragment and form stars. While advanced RHD simulations are required to establish the importance of this effect, adopting an optimistic guess, we find that the SFE increases with cloud surface density, rising from $\\epsilon_*=0.023$ at $\\Sigma_g = 37\\ M_\\odot\\ \\mathrm{pc^{-2}}$ to $\\epsilon_*=0.27$ at $\\Sigma_g = 1.7 \\times 10^5\\ M_\\odot\\ \\mathrm{pc^{-2}}$. Given the optimistic assumptions adopted, these numbers should be regarded as upper limits. We conclude that Ly$\\alpha$ radiation pressure strongly limits the SFE, even at solar metallicities, erasing the possibility that a feedback-free star formation mode with $\\epsilon_* \\gtrsim 0.4$ exists in the pre-SN phase. This conclusion remains valid even when other effects such as dust destruction of Ly$\\alpha$ photons, presence of HII regions, velocity gradients, atomic recoil, and turbulence are considered.",

Comments are very welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Wide-separation lensed quasars (WSLQs) are a rare subclass of strongly lensed quasars produced by massive galaxy clusters. They provide valuable probes of dark-matter halos and quasar host galaxies. However, only about ten WSLQ systems are currently known, which limits further studies. To enlarge the sample from wide-area surveys, we developed a catalog-based pipeline and applied it to the CatNorth database, a catalog of quasar candidates constructed from Gaia DR3. CatNorth contains 1,545,514 quasar candidates with about 90% purity and a Gaia G-band limiting magnitude of roughly 21. The pipeline has three stages. First, we identify groups with separations between 10 and 72 arcsec using a HEALPix grid with 25.6 arcsec spacing and a friends-of-friends search. We then filter by intra-group color and spectral similarity, reducing the 1,545,514 sources to 14,244 groups while retaining all known, discoverable WSLQs. Finally, a visual check, guided by image geometry and the presence of likely foreground lenses, yields the candidate list with quality labels. We identify 333 new WSLQ candidates with separations from 10 to 56.8 arcsec. Using available SDSS DR16 and DESI DR1 spectroscopy, we uncover two new candidate systems; the remaining 331 candidates lack sufficient spectra and are labeled as 45 grade A, 98 grade B, and 188 grade C. We also compile 29 confirmed dual quasars as a by-product. When feasible, we plan follow-up spectroscopy and deeper imaging to confirm WSLQs among these candidates and enable the related science.",

We show that if gradients in the magnetic field become too steep, the implied charge drift speeds become much faster than microphysical signal speeds, invalidating the assumptions used to derive both the resistivities and MHD equations themselves. Generically this situation will excite microscale instabilities that suppress the drift and current. We show this could be relevant at low ionization fractions especially if Hall terms appear significant, external forces induce supersonic motions, or dust grains become a dominant charge carrier. Considering well-established treatments of super-thermal drifts in laboratory, terrestrial, and Solar plasmas as well as conduction and viscosity models, we generalize a simple prescription to rectify these issues, where the resistivities are multiplied by a correction factor that depends only on already-known macroscopic quantities. This is generalized for multi-species and weakly-ionized systems, and leaves the equations unchanged in the drift limits for which they are derived, but restores physical behavior (driving the system back towards slow drift by diffusing away small-scale gradients in the magnetic field) if the limits are violated. This has important consequences: restoring intuitive behaviors such as the system becoming hydrodynamic in the limit of zero ionization; suppressing magnetic structure on scales below a critical length which can comparable to circumstellar disk sizes; limiting the maximum magnetic amplification; and suppressing the effects of the Hall term in particular. This likely implies that the Hall term does not become dynamically important under most conditions of interest in these systems.",

This project aims at analyzing - observationally and theoretically - the character and physical origins of fluctuations in solar photospheric absorption lines. Observationally, photospheric equivalent-width variations were measured in 1000 selected spectra from three years of HARPS-N data of the Sun-as-a-star, showing changes that largely shadow the chromospheric CaII H&K activity-cycle signal, but with much smaller amplitudes on sub-percent levels. Among iron lines, the greatest are for FeII in the blue, while the trends change sign among lines in the green MgI triplet and between Balmer lines. No variation was seen in the semi-forbidden MgI 457.1 nm. Theoretically, hydrodynamic 3D modeling of solar surface convection produced time sequences of synthetic high-resolution spectral atlases. Radial velocities averaged over small simulation areas jitter by some +-150 m/s, scaling to 2 m/s for the full solar disk on timescales of granular convection. Among different lines, jittering is in phase, but amplitudes differ by about one tenth of their values: greater for stronger and for ionized lines, decreasing at longer wavelengths.",

Our aim is to determine the physical mechanism responsible for the wave-induced mixing in stellar interiors. We compare the mixing profiles obtained from two-dimensional (2D) equatorial hydrodynamical and tracer particle simulations with theoretical predictions from R. J. Garcia Lopez & H. C. Spruit (1991) and J. P. Zahn (1992) on wave mixing due to wave-induced shear turbulence. Our results show that, despite not satisfying the vertical shear instability threshold, the mixing profiles from the simulations agree remarkably well with the theoretical predictions of both prescriptions, strongly suggesting that shear from IGWs plays an important role in mixing even at low shear rates. This agreement remains robust across different stellar masses, ages, rotation and simulation parameters. This provides an important step in providing realistic parameterisations for wave mixing in stellar structure and evolution models.",

We aim to quantify this relationship for pre-main sequence stars of intermediate mass ranging from $1.2 M_{\\mathsf{sun}}$ to $6 M_{\\mathsf{sun}}$. These stars have a similar thermal and density structure, making this a suitable choice to isolate the effect of changing mass. We produce a series of two-dimensional global simulations of stars using MUSIC, a fully compressible, time-implicit hydrodynamics code. The stars that we select for this study are near the end of the pre-main sequence and are convectively unstable above 80% of their stellar radius; they thus have a convective envelope that is shallower than the current sun. For this series of stellar models, a simple scaling with luminosity, with a scaling exponent of 1/4, accounts for the increasing overshooting with stellar mass. This result has interesting similarities with the scaling found by Baraffe et al. [2023] for a range of intermediate mass and massive stars at the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) that have convective cores.",

Studying these structures is critical for understanding solar atmospheric heating and mass transportation. The purpose of this study is to obtain the characteristics of fibrils surrounding the filament. By employing high-resolution H-alpha data obtained from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST), we undertake a detailed analysis of the properties of 63 fibrils situated in the vicinity of the filament. Comparing the fibrils on both sides of the filament demonstrates that these fibrils have similar physical properties except for their orientation. The properties of fibrils are statistically measured, including lifetimes of 150-650 s, widths of 320-850 km, maximum lengths of 3-8.5 Mm, projection velocities of 7-29 km/s, and decelerations of 45-474 m/s2. The dominant oscillation period of fibrils is predominantly concentrated in the range of 4.8-6.6 minutes (2.5-3.5 mHz). Transverse oscillations are identified in a subset of fibrils, with periodicities of 269-289 s and phase speeds of 13.7-25.8 km/s, indicating the presence of kink-mode magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves.",

We employed the Rybicki-Hummer (RH) 1.5D radiative transfer code to synthesize the Stokes profiles of the Mg I 12.32 {\\mu}m line based on a three-dimensional solar atmospheric model of a sunspot and its surrounding quiet Sun. By computing Rxi{\\Delta}xi, where Rxi is the average response function and {\\Delta}xi is the difference in physical parameters between the two models being compared, we identified the atmospheric height and physical parameters that most significantly influence the normalized peak intensity in the quiet Sun and the active region, respectively. In analyzing the synthesized Stokes profiles, we found two key features: (1) in the quiet Sun, the normalized peak intensity is strong at the centers of the granules and weakens in the intergranular lanes; (2) in the sunspot umbra, the normalized peak intensity is generally weak, with only a few areas showing evident emission. Through the analysis of the response functions, we identified the causes of these differences. In addition, we discussed the mechanisms through which these physical parameters influence the normalized peak intensity.",

      "abstract": "Impacts of small-scale dynamo on rotating columnar convection in stellar convection zones Yuto Bekki 23 pages, 20 figures (& Appendix); accepted for publication in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Understanding the complex interactions between convection, magnetic fields, and rotation is key to modeling the internal dynamics of the Sun and stars. Under rotational influence, compressible convection forms prograde-propagating convective columns near the equator. The interaction between such rotating columnar convection and the small-scale dynamo (SSD) remains largely unexplored. We investigate the influence of the SSD on the properties of rotating convection in the equatorial regions of solar and stellar convection zones. A series of rotating compressible magnetoconvection simulations is performed using a local f-plane box model at the equator. The flux-based Coriolis number Co is varied systematically. To isolate the effects of the SSD, we compare results from hydrodynamic (HD) and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. The SSD affects both convective heat and angular momentum transport. In MHD cases, convective velocity decreases more rapidly with increasing Co than in HD cases. This reduction is compensated by enhanced entropy fluctuations, maintaining overall heat transport efficiency. Furthermore, a weakly subadiabatic layer is maintained near the base of the convection zone even under strong rotational influence when the SSD is present. These behaviors reflect a change in the dominant force balance: the SSD introduces a magnetostrophic balance at small scales, while geostrophic balance persists at larger scales. The inclusion of the SSD also reduces the dominant horizontal scale of columnar convective modes by enhancing the effective rotational influence. Regarding angular momentum transport, the SSD generates Maxwell stresses that counteract the Reynolds stresses, thereby quenching the generation of mean shear flows. These SSD effects should be accounted for in models of solar and stellar convection.",

The asymmetric expansion of Berkeley 59 Bruno Wiesneth, Koraljka Muzic, Victor Almendros-Abad Accepted for publication in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Accurate measurements of young stellar cluster internal dynamics provide crucial insights into their formation. With Gaia, we are now able to trace stellar motions and study the dynamics of star clusters with unprecedented precision, but this requires a reliable list of probable members. We examine a 2 deg-radius region in Cepheus OB4, centered on the young cluster Berkeley 59, to build a reliable candidate member list, enabling the study of the cluster's structure, kinematics, and stellar population. We compiled a catalog of optical and near-infrared photometry, along with precise positions and proper motions from Gaia DR3, for sources in the Cepheus OB4 field. Membership probabilities were determined using a probabilistic random forest algorithm and further refined by requiring HR diagram positions consistent with a young age. From a list of 1030 probable members, we estimate a distance of 1009+-12 pc to Berkeley 59. Masses, extinction, and ages were derived by fitting the spectral energy distributions to atmospheric and evolutionary models, while internal dynamics was analyzed using proper motions relative to the cluster's mean motion. Berkeley 59 exhibits an asymmetric expansion pattern with velocity increasing outward and a preferred motion toward the north. The IMF between 0.4 and 7 MSun follows a single power law (dN/dM \\propto M**-alpha), with the slope alpha=2.3+-0.3, consistent with Salpeter's slope and previous studies in the region. The region's median age, estimated from the HR diagram, is 2.9 Myr. The velocity dispersion of Berkeley 59 exceeds the virial velocity dispersion derived from its total mass (650+-30 MSun) and half-mass radius (1.71+-0.13 pc). The 2D motions of a stellar group located about 1 deg north of Berkeley 59 provide further support for the previously proposed triggered star formation scenario. (Abridged)",

Accepted to Astronomy and Astrophysics on 22/09/2025 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Optical Forbidden Emission Lines (FELs) come from transitions with long radiative decay times needing low density gas where collisions between atoms are rare. They are produced in the outflows driven by young stellar objects. These lines trace distinct velocity components, including a Low Velocity Component (LVC), which may be tracing a magneto hydrodynamic (MHD) or photoevaporative (PE) wind. We study the jet and LVC of the star DG Tau, whose jet velocity has decreased since 2006. We aim to investigate a link between the high velocity jet and the LVC and clarify the LVC origin as an MHD or PE wind by studying spectral \\& spatial changes over time. Using kinematic fitting \\& spectro-astrometry, we analyse three epochs of spectra spanning ~18 years. A ~100 km/s decrease in velocity from 2003 to 2021 aligns with known slowing of the jet. Fitting of the [O I] {\\lambda}6300, [O I] {\\lambda}5577, and [S II] {\\lambda}6731 lines reveal complex FEL profiles, with up to six blue-shifted components and a redshifted wing, in agreement with Chou et al. (2025). We see three LVC sub-components (LVC-H, LVC-M, and LVC-L) that are consistent with entrained jet material, disk wind, and dense upper disk atmosphere respectively. While jet components vary in time, the LVC remains quite stable, with changes in the relative brightness of each sub-component. The results cannot distinguish between a MHD or PE wind origin for the LVC. A limit of less than 2 au is put on the de projected height of the LVC-M in [O I] {\\lambda}5577, where there is no jet contribution. This supports a disk wind and may favor an MHD wind origin. The near constant peak velocity of LVC-M needs further study in context of a shared origin for jets and MHD winds. Future work needs observations with higher spectral resolution and time cadence to resolve blended components and examine a possible time lag between changes in the jet and LVC.",

Comments welcome Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Be stars are widely considered to be the product of binary interaction. However, whether all Be stars are formed via binary interaction is unclear, and detailed estimates of the multiplicity of Be stars and characterization of their components are required. In this study, we present speckle observations of 76 Be stars taken using the Gemini North and South speckle imagers spanning angular separations of 20 mas-1.2\", reaching contrasts ${\\Delta}$m~5-6 mag at separations around 0.1\". We identify 11 (6 previously unreported) binaries having separations in the 10-1000 au range, and ${\\Delta}$m between 0.8-5 mag in our sample. Using archival data to search for components outside our visibility range, we add further multiples (16), which include three triples, leading to a total of 24 multiple systems. Our findings rule out a multiplicity fraction >27% at the 3${\\sigma}$ level within the speckle observations separation range and detection limits. Future homogeneous spectroscopic/interferometric observations are essential to probe the inner separations, and along with analysis of available astrometry can cover the entire separation range to characterize the multiplicity fraction, and evolutionary scenario of Be stars.",

These sources are almost all isolated and are the closest laboratories we have for detailed atmospheric studies of giant planets formed outside the solar system. Here we report JWST observations of one such source, WISEA J153429.75-104303.3 (W1534), which we confirm is a substellar mass member of the Galactic halo with a metallicity <0.01xsolar. Its spectrum reveals methane (CH4), water (H2O), and silane (SiH4) gas. Although SiH4 is expected to serve as a key reservoir for the cloud-forming element Si in gas giant worlds, it eluded detection until now because it is removed from observable atmospheres by the formation of silicate clouds at depth. These condensates are favored with increasing metallicity, explaining why SiH4 remains undetected on well studied, metal-rich solar system worlds like Jupiter and Saturn. On the metal-poor world W1534, we detect a clear signature of SiH4 centered at ~4.55 microns with an abundance of 19+/-2 parts per billion (ppb). Our chemical modelling suggests that this SiH4 abundance may be quenched at ~kilobar levels just above the silicate cloud layers, whereupon vertical atmospheric mixing can transport SiH4 to the observable photosphere. The formation and detection of SiH4 demonstrates key coupled relationships between composition, cloud formation, and atmospheric mixing in cold brown dwarf and planetary atmospheres.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Recent studies indicate that the formation of planets in protoplanetary disks begins early in the embedded Class 0/I phases of protostellar evolution. The physical and chemical makeup of the embedded phase can provide valuable insights into the process of star and planet formation. This study aims to provide a thorough overview of the various morphologies for molecular emissions observed on disk scales toward nearby embedded sources. We present high angular resolution (0.1\", 15 au) molecular line emissions for $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, SO, SiO, DCN, CH$_3$OH, H$_2$CO, and c-C$_3$H$_2$ towards 19 nearby protostellar sources in the context of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Large Program \"Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk)\". Emissions in $^{12}$CO are seen towards all sources and primarily trace outflowing materials. A few sources also show high-velocity jets in SiO emission and high-velocity channel maps of $^{12}$CO. The $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O emissions are well-known tracers of high-density regions and trace the inner envelope and disk regions with clear signs of rotation seen at continuum scales. The large-scale emissions of $^{13}$CO also delineate the outflow cavity walls where the outflowing and infalling materials interact with each other, and exposure to UV radiation leads to the formation of hydrocarbons such as c-C$_3$H$_2$. Both DCN and CH$_3$OH, when detected, show compact emissions from the inner envelope and disk regions that peak at the position of the protostar. The CH$_3$OH emissions are contained within the region of DCN emissions, which suggests that CH$_3$OH traces the hot core regions. Likewise, a few sources also display emissions in CH$_3$OH towards the outflow. Both SO and H$_2$CO show complex morphology among the sources, suggesting that they are formed through multiple processes in protostellar systems.",

Hinode/EIS flare list used in this study is publicly available Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Non-thermal velocities, derived from spectral line broadening, can provide crucial insights into plasma dynamics before and during solar flares. To systematically study the pre-flare phase, we constructed a Hinode/Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) flare catalog of 1,449 flares from 2011--2024. This enabled a large-scale analysis of flare loop footpoint non-thermal velocity evolution across different flare magnitudes (C, M, X-classes). Analyzing Fe VIII--Fe XXIV emission lines formed at $\\log(T/K) \\sim 5.7-7.3$ with piecewise linear fits in the pre-flare period, we find that non-thermal velocities consistently increase 4--25 minutes before GOES soft X-ray start in C and M-class flares. Onset timing patterns vary with flare magnitude: smaller flares show temperature-dependent progression, while larger flares exhibit more compressed, near-simultaneous onsets across temperatures. While our limited X-class sample ($N=18$) also show onset before GOES, larger statistics are needed to confirm its behavior. M-class flares show a systematic precursor non-thermal velocity onset $\\sim$30--60 minutes before GOES peak. In a subset of M-class flares (2011--2018), CME-associated events show earlier and more uniform precursor onsets (45--74 minutes before peak) than non-CME events, of which only some lines display a precursor, suggesting a strong link between extended pre-flare non-thermal broadening and successful eruptions. This large scale study establishes pre-flare non-thermal velocity increase at footpoints as a common precursor observable before any X-ray signature.",

      "abstract": "Three-component Phase Separation for Ultramassive White Dwarf Models Matias Castro-Tapia, Andrew Cumming Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We investigate phase separation in oxygen-neon (O/Ne) ultramassive white dwarfs (UMWDs). Current stellar evolution codes, such as MESA, only account for $\\mathrm{^{16}O/^{20}Ne}$ separation and do not include other minor species. To improve this, we implement ternary phase diagrams into MESA. We construct UMWD models with O/Ne/sodium (Na) and O/Ne/magnesium (Mg) cores to test our implementation. We also assess the effect of including $\\mathrm{^{22}Ne}$ in the current two-species framework. Our results show that incorporating additional components into the phase separation significantly alters the chemical evolution of UMWDs. Heavier elements preferentially enrich the solid core, enhancing mixing in the overlying liquid. We compute the buoyancy flux driven by compositional instabilities during crystallization. As in previous studies, we find two convective regimes: an early, fast overturning convection, lasting less than a million years, followed by inefficient (thermohaline) convection. The fast convective regime lasts up to 100 times longer with three-species separation compared to the standard $\\mathrm{^{16}O/^{20}Ne}$ case. We find that neutron-rich species can have a significant contribution to the buoyancy flux despite their small mass fraction (<10\\%). We compute the amount of cooling delay induced by phase separation in UMWDs, and find that the three-species phase separation produces a delay up to $\\sim10$ times larger than the simplest case of fractionation, although still less than 1 Gyr. We predict that the change in the composition profile in the liquid region when three components are included should change the frequency of gravity modes that can propagate in the interior of pulsating UMWDs.",

Lanzafame, Yassine Damerdji Accepted for publication in Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present a spectroscopic and photometric study of HIP12653 to investigate its magnetic cycle and differential rotation. Using HARPS archival spectra matched with MARCS-AMBER theoretical templates, we derive the stellar parameters (Teff, logg, FeH, and vsini) of the target. The S-index, an activity indicator based on the emission of the CaII H&K lines, is fitted to determine the magnetic cycle and rotation periods. We refine the magnetic cycle period to 5799.20 \\pm 0.88 d and suggest the existence of a secondary, shorter cycle of 674.6922 \\pm 0.0098 d, making HIP12653 the youngest star known to exhibit such a short activity cycle. During the minimum activity phase, a rotation period of 4.8 d is estimated. This is notably different from the 7-day period obtained when measurements during minimum activity are excluded, suggesting that these two periods are rotation periods at different latitudes. To explore this hypothesis, we introduce a novel light curve fitting method that incorporates multiple harmonics to model different spot configurations. Applied to synthetic light curves, the method recovers at least two rotation periods close to the true input values in 92.1% of cases. The inferred rotation shear shows a median deviation of 0.0011 \\pm 0.0003 and a standard deviation of 0.0177 \\pm 0.0002 from the true value. Applying this approach to TESS photometric data from 2018 to 2023, we detect three distinct rotation periods, 4.8 d, 5.7 d, and 7.7 d, (along with a signal at 3.75 d interpreted as its first harmonic), consistent with spots located at different latitudes. Assuming a solar-like differential rotation, we estimate an inclination of 34.0 \\pm 1.8^\\circ and a rotational shear of \\alpha = 0.38 \\pm 0.01. These results confirm the 4.8-d period and demonstrate that differential rotation can be constrained by tracking rotation period changes across different phases of the magnetic cycle.",

Wang Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Here we investigate an infrared eruptive source, identified from the decade-long VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea survey (VVV). We named this target after a group of variable sources discovered by VVV, as VVV-WIT-13, with WIT standing for \"What Is This?\", due to its unique photometric variation behaviour and the mysterious origin of the outburst. This target exhibited an outburst with a 5.7 mag amplitude in the Ks-band, remained on its brightness plateau for 3.5 years, and then rapidly faded to its pre-eruptive brightness afterwards. We aim to reveal the variable nature and outburst origin of VVV-WIT-13 by presenting our follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations along with theoretical models. We gathered photometric time series in both near- and mid-infrared wavelengths. We obtained near-infrared spectra during the outburst and decaying stages on XSHOOTER/VLT and FIRE/Magellan, and then fitted the detected molecular absorption features using models from ExoMol. We applied 2D numerical simulations to re-create the observables of the eruptive phenomenon. We observe deep AlO absorption bands in the infrared spectra of VVV-WIT-13, during the outburst stage, along with other more common absorption bands (e.g. CO). Our best-fit model suggests a 600 K temperature of the AlO absorption band. In the decaying stage, the AlO bands disappeared, whilst broad blue-shifted H2 lines arose, a common indicator of stellar wind and outflow. The observational evidence suggests that the CO and TiO features originate from an outflow or a wind environment. We find that VVV-WIT-13 is an eruptive young star with instability occurring in the accretion disk. One favoured theoretical explanation of this event is a disrupted gas clump at a distance of 3 au from the source. If confirmed, this would be the first such event observed in real time.",

SPIE 13627, Techniques and Instrumentation for Detection of Exoplanets XII, 136271J (18 September 2025) Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) When coherent light propagates through a multimode optical fiber, the modes interfere at the fiber exit boundary, producing a high-contrast speckle interference pattern called modal noise. This non-uniform interference pattern introduces systematic errors in fiber-fed precision radial velocity (RV) spectrographs which are detrimental to exoplanet mass measurement. Modal noise can be mitigated by a device called a fiber mode scrambler or fiber agitator, which dynamically perturbs the fiber to change the interference pattern over time, smoothing it over long exposures. In this paper, we present a prototype optical fiber mode scrambler based on a four-bar linkage crank-rocker mechanism, developed for the GMT-Consortium Large Earth Finder (G-CLEF). G-CLEF is a fiber-fed, high-resolution, precision RV spectrograph for the Magellan Clay Telescope and Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT). To support this effort, we developed a fiber testing setup capable of imaging the near-field and far-field output of fibers and measuring focal ratio degradation. We designed, built, and tested the mode scrambler, using our setup, on step-index multimode optical fibers with various shapes, including octagonal, square, and rectangular core cross-sections. We developed custom software utilizing alpha shapes to identify the boundary of an arbitrarily shaped fiber and to compute a signal-to-noise ratio metric for quantifying modal noise. We investigated the effects of different mode scrambler parameters, such as agitation frequency, on mitigating modal noise. Our results offer valuable insights into optimizing fiber mode scrambling for precision RV spectrographs.",

Sivarani, Dhanush S R, Lokesh Manickavasaham, Parvathy M, Devika K Divakar, Arun Surya Submitted to Springer Proceedings Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Atmospheric characterization of exoplanets has traditionally relied on Low-Resolution Transmission Spectroscopy (LRTS), obtained from both space- and ground-based facilities, as well as on High-Resolution Transmission Spectroscopy (HRTS). Although HRTS can resolve individual spectral lines, it is subject to normalization degeneracies that limit the accurate retrieval of key atmospheric parameters such as pressure, abundance, and cloud opacity. A promising strategy to mitigate this issue is to combine ground-based HRTS with space-based LRTS. However, this approach depends on two separate datasets, thereby requiring two independent observations. In this study, we explore the feasibility of Multi-Object High-Resolution Transmission Spectroscopy (Mo-HRTS) as a means to constrain atmospheric parameters in retrievals using a single dataset. Through simulations based on existing spectrograph specifications for a well-studied target, we demonstrate that low-resolution broadband transmission spectra can be extracted from Mo-HRTS data.",

Cooke Accepted for publication in PNAS special feature on Characterization of Exoplanets in the JWST Era Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Sub-Neptune planets, with sizes and masses between those of Earth and Neptune, dominate the exoplanet population. Sub-Neptunes are expected to be the most diverse family of the exoplanet population, potentially including rocky gas dwarfs, water worlds, and mini-Neptunes, with a wide range of atmospheric, surface and interior conditions. With no analogue in the solar system, these planets open fundamental questions in planetary processes, origins, and habitability, and present new avenues in the search for life elsewhere. Atmospheric observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are enabling unprecedented characterization of sub-Neptunes, starting with the first detections of carbon-bearing molecules in the habitable zone sub-Neptune K2-18 b. We survey the present landscape of JWST observations and atmospheric inferences of sub-Neptunes, which in turn provide key insights into their atmospheric processes, internal structures, surface conditions, formation pathways and potential habitability. The atmospheric abundance constraints reveal evidence of chemical disequilibria, and insights into the planetary mass-metallicity relation in the sub-Neptune regime. Similarly, for sub-Neptunes with H$_2$O-rich interiors, increasing atmospheric H$_2$O abundances with the equilibrium temperature may indicate the existence of a critical temperature for transition from H$_2$ dominated atmospheres with tropospheric cold traps to those with steamy atmospheres. The chemical abundances also provide initial evidence for diverse planet types, from potentially habitable hycean worlds to steam worlds with super critical water layers. These planet types serve as benchmarks for an emerging taxonomy of volatile-rich sub-Neptunes as a function of their equilibrium temperature and atmospheric extent, heralding a new era of chemical classification of low-mass exoplanets with JWST.",

Affiliation updated according to Section 25 (Research Paper Publishing Policy) IITM BS Degree student handbook Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We present CLARA, a modular framework for unsupervised transit detection in TESS light curves, leveraging Unsupervised Random Forests (URFs) trained on synthetic datasets and guided by morphological similarity analysis. This work addresses two core questions: (a) How does the design of synthetic training sets affect the performance and generalization of URFs across independent TESS sectors? (b) Do URF anomaly scores correlate with genuine astrophysical phenomena, enabling effective identification and clustering of transit-like signals? We investigate these questions through a two-part study focused on (1) detection performance optimization, and (2) the physical interpretability of anomalies. In Part I, we introduce three URF model variants tuned via alpha-controlled scoring objectives, and evaluate their generalization across five TESS sectors. This large-scale test involved scoring 384,000 individual light curves (128,000 light curves per alpha variant), revealing stable, interpretable differences between recall-optimized, precision-optimized, and balanced models. In Part II, our optimized clustering (DPMM Cluster 2) yields a 14.04% detection rate (16 confirmed transits among 114 candidates) from the first five TESS SPOC sectors. This reflects a substantial enrichment over baseline rates: 0.4569% for the full TESS-SPOC project candidate set (7658 candidates across 1.68 million light curves), and 0.2650% for the FFI-based SPOC sample (7658 candidates across 2.89 million light curves;). Additionally, we perform Monte Carlo injection-recovery tests to assess feasibility, stability, justification and quantification of methods outlined.

With sensitivity far exceeding current facilities, CTAO will provide detailed measurements of gamma rays from GeV up to a few 100s of TeV. CTAO has a nominal field of view of 10° and will rely on external alerts from observatories such as IceCube (neutrinos), Fermi-LAT (GeV gamma rays), LIGO (gravitational waves (GWs)) or the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory (optical) to trigger observations of targets of opportunity (ToOs). The Transients Handler (TH) is a subsystem of the Array Control and Data Acquisition that will provide the means of handling alerts and schedule follow-up observations. The TH is responsible for (i) filtering of thousands of internal and external alerts per night, (ii) processing of alerts according to the corresponding observation proposal to determine the optimal observation schedule with minimum interruptions to observations and (iii) broadcasting of events detected by CTAO to external facilities. In this work, we will discuss the architecture of the Transients Handler, its latest improvements and future updates",

Haloscope experiments commonly employ resonant cavities to search for a conversion of axion dark matter into photons in external magnetic fields. As the expected signal power degrades with increasing frequency, this approach becomes challenging at frequencies beyond tens of Gigahertz. Here, we propose a novel haloscope design based on an open Fabry-Pérot resonator. Operating a small-scale resonator at cryogenic temperatures and at modest magnetic fields should already lead to an unparalleled sensitivity for photon-axion couplings $g_{a\\gamma} \\gtrsim 3\\times10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ at 35GHz.

Rea, Wladimir Lyra 28 pages, 15 figures, submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The streaming instability (SI) is a leading mechanism for planetesimal formation, driving the aerodynamic concentration of solids in protoplanetary disks. The SI triggers strong clumping (i.e., strong enough for clumps to collapse) when the solid-to-gas column density ratio, $Z$, exceeds a threshold, $\\Zcrit$. This threshold depends on the dimensionless stopping time, $\\tau_s$. Although the strong-clumping threshold has been explored over the last decade, it has been determined largely through 2D axisymmetric simulations. In this work, we perform a suite of 3D, vertically stratified simulations to establish a clumping threshold across $10^{-3} \\leq \\tau_s \\leq 1.0$. Additionally, we study SI-driven concentration that is unique to 3D. We find that $\\Zcrit$ is as low as $\\approx 0.002$ at $\\tau_s=0.1$ and exceeds $\\approx 0.03$ at $\\tau_s=10^{-3}$. Compared to 2D, our 3D results yield lower $\\Zcrit$ for $\\tau_s > 0.02$, but higher for $\\tau_s \\leq 0.02$, with a sharp transition between $\\tau_s = 0.02$ and 0.03. This transition correlates with midplane density ratio ($\\epsilon$): $\\epsilon < 1$ where 3D gives lower thresholds, and $\\epsilon > 1$ where 3D gives higher thresholds. We also find a filaments-in-filaments structure when $\\epsilon < 1$, which enhances clumping compared to 2D. By contrast, when $\\epsilon > 1$ and $\\tau_s \\leq 0.03$, dust filaments in 3D do not drift inward, suppressing filament mergers and strong clumping. In 2D, filaments drift inward regardless of $\\epsilon$, triggering strong clumping easier in this regime. Our results underscore the necessity of 3D simulations for accurately capturing SI-driven concentration and building the strong-clumping threshold.",

Vorobyov, Takashi Hosokawa 20 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Super-Earths exist around subsolar-metallicity host stars with a frequency comparable to that around solar-metallicity stars, suggesting efficient assembly of dust grains even in metal-deficient environments. In this study, we propose a pathway for the formation of multiple dust rings that will promote planetesimal formation in a subsolar-metallicity disk. We investigate the long-term evolution of a circumstellar disk with 0.1 $Z_{\\odot}$ over 750 kyr from its formation stage using two-dimensional thin-disk hydrodynamic simulations. The motion of dust grains is solved separately from the gas, incorporating dust growth and self-consistent radial drift. The disk is initially gravitationally unstable and undergoes intense fragmentation. By 300 kyr, it tends toward a stable state, leaving a single gravitationally bound clump. This clump generates tightly wound spiral arms through its orbital motion. After the clump dissipates at $\\sim$410 kyr, the spiral arms transition into axisymmetric substructures under the influence of viscosity. These axisymmetric substructures create local gas pressure bumps that halt the inward radial drift of dust grains, resulting in the formation of multiple-ring-shaped dust distributions. We observe several rings within $\\simeq$200 au of the central star, with separations between them on the order of $\\sim$10 au, and dust surface density contrasts with inter-ring gaps by factors of $\\sim$10-100. We also demonstrate that turbulent viscosities at observationally suggested levels are essential for converting spiral arms into axisymmetric substructures. We speculate that the physical conditions in the dust rings may be conducive to the development of streaming instability and planetesimal formation.",

A kinetic impactor deflection strategy is the most technologically mature path in order to mitigate this threat. Our goal is to constrain the possible range in momentum transfer coefficients, with implications for the number of impactors and the disruption risk. We conduct a series of numerical simulations, using a shock physics smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, in which we vary the impact velocity, cohesive properties and physical properties (mass / porosity) of the target asteroid. Given a judiciously chosen impactor mass, we show that the momentum transfer coefficient range is capable of a moderate-to-large enhancement of the asteroid deflection, yet keeps the disruption risk firmly at bay. These results are generally unique in having higher impact velocities compared to most previous studies.",

Polarimetry, however, provides independent assessment.

This is broadly consistent with results from both Hubble transmission spectroscopy and JWST secondary eclipse spectroscopy suggesting small, SiO$_2$ scattering particles. It is difficult to reconcile large polarization and moderate Hubble secondary eclipse depth via pure Rayleigh, silicate, or MnS scatterers. The measured polarization of HD 189733b is detected with such high confidence that we place a $2\\sigma$ lower limit on its $B$ band geometric albedo of $A_g > 0.26$ with a preferred value of $A_g = 0.6$.

It also validates Rayleigh scattering from the exoplanet, as opposed to starspot contamination, as the cause of HD 189733's blue optical slope in transmission spectroscopy.

Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We investigate the spectra of Earth-like planets but with different axial rotation periods. Using the general circulation model of the atmosphere and considering the atmospheric circulation lasting for two years, we calculated the radiation spectra of the Earth and the exo-Earth rotating with periods of 1 and 100 days, respectively. The radiation spectra of the atmospheres were calculated with the SBDART code. We analyzed the spectrum of upward radiation at altitudes of 1 and 11 km in wavelength ranges of 1 to 18 and 0.3 to 1 micron. The following common features were obtained for the Earth and the exo-Earth: (1) the planets exhibit a wide absorption band of CO2 around 14 micron; (2) the radiation spectra at different locations near the equator show no significant differences; and (3) if the spectrum is integrated over the entire disk of the Earth/exo-Earth, the difference in the spectral signal obtained in observations from different directions becomes substantially lower than the difference between the results of observations of individual regions of the planets. The differences in the spectra of exoplanets, which differ from the Earth only in axial rotation period, are comparable to the differences associated with changes in the angle of viewing the planet. Consequently, if the observation angle is not known, the analysis of the spectrum of the planet cannot be used to determine its axial rotation period. The maximal differences in the spectra of Earth-like exoplanets were obtained for wavelengths of about 5-10 and 13-16 micron. By analyzing the spectrum at wavelengths around 9.4-10 micron, we can determine whether the atmosphere of the exoplanet contains ozone or not. Since ozone is essential for life, the 9.4-10 micron band may be important for future observations of Earth-like exoplanets.",

However, if a large fraction of HWO target stars host unknown disruptive giant planets in their habitable zones (HZs), then additional targets that are farther away will need to be added to the survey, potentially requiring a larger-aperture telescope and a coronagraph with a smaller inner working angle (IWA). Therefore, the sooner we constrain the presence of massive planets orbiting potential HWO target stars, the easier and less costly it will be to adjust key aspects of HWO's architecture. In this work, we uniformly analyze over 153,000 public archival radial velocity (RV) observations of 120 potential HWO target stars to derive mass limits on planetary companions. The RVs were measured by 23 high-precision spectrographs located at 15 observatories around the world, with the first data going back to 1987. Based on empirical search completeness tests, we determine that undetected Jupiter-mass (Saturn-mass) planets may be hiding in up to 38% (53%) of the HZs of targets in the ExEP Mission Star List. The median mass sensitivity limit in the middle of the conservative HZ is approximately 48 M$_\\oplus$. We also provide updated orbital parameters for 53 known companions, and we detect 4 planet candidates and 26 signals corresponding to stellar activity. We note that 44 of the ExEP stars lack substantial RV monitoring history, and we advocate for community-coordinated observing campaigns of these stars using moderate-precision RV facilities.",

Changes from v1: Figure 7 augmented, Figure D2 added and clarification text added in various places, but conclusions unchanged. Accepted by ApJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph) Photo-evaporation shapes the observed radii of small exoplanets and constrains the underlying distributions of atmospheric and core masses. However, the diversity of atmospheric chemistries corresponding to these distributions remains unelucidated. We develop a first-principles carbon-hydrogen-oxygen-sulfur-silicon (CHOSSi) outgassing model that accounts for non-ideal gas behavior (via fugacities) at high pressures, as well as the tendency for water and hydrogen to dissolve in melt (via solubility laws). We use data-driven radius valley constraints to establish the relationship between the atmospheric surface pressures and melt temperatures of sub-Neptunes. Sub-Neptunes with less massive rocky cores retain less of their primordial hydrogen envelopes, which leads to less heat retention and diminished melt temperatures at the surfaces of these cores. Lower melt temperatures lead thermodynamically to the dominance of carbon-, oxygen-, sulfur- and silicon-bearing molecules over molecular hydrogen, which naturally produce a diversity of mean molecular weights. Our geochemical outgassing calculations robustly predict a gradient of mean molecular weight across the radius valley, where the strength of this gradient is primarily driven by the oxygen fugacity of the molten cores and not by the carbon enrichment (or \"metallicity\") of the atmosphere. Smaller sub-Neptunes are predicted to have less hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. The precise relationship between the observed and outgassed chemistries requires an understanding of how convection near the core interacts with large-scale atmospheric circulation (driven by stellar heating) near the photosphere, as well as the influence of photochemistry.",

Pierrehumbert, Emma Postolec, Samuel Boucher, Alex McGinty, Bo Peng, Diana Valencia, Mark Hammond Typo in planet mass error corrected in this version. Accepted in ApJL September 20, 2025 Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Ultra-short period (USP) exoplanets -- with $R_p \\leq 2~$R$_{\\oplus}$ and periods $\\leq$1 day -- are expected to be stripped of volatile atmospheres by intense host star irradiation, which is corroborated by their nominal bulk densities and previous eclipse observations consistent with bare rock surfaces. However, a few USP planets appear anomalously under-dense relative to an Earth-like composition, suggesting an exotic interior structure (e.g., core-less) or a volatile-rich secondary atmosphere increasing their apparent radius. Here we present the first dayside emission spectrum of the low density (4.3$\\pm$0.4 g~cm$^{-3}$) ultra-short period planet TOI-561 b, which orbits an iron-poor, alpha-rich, $\\sim$10 Gyr old thick disk star. Our 3-5 $\\mu$m JWST/NIRSpec observations demonstrate the dayside of TOI-561 b is inconsistent with a bare-rock surface at high statistical significance, suggesting instead a thick volatile envelope that is cooling the dayside to well below the $\\sim$3000 K expected in the bare rock or thin atmosphere case. These results reject the popular hypothesis of complete atmospheric desiccation for highly irradiated exoplanets and support predictions that planetary-scale magma oceans can retain substantial reservoirs of volatiles, opening the geophysical study of ultra-hot super-Earths through the lens of their atmospheres.",
