In this study, we analyze continuous GWs from the SMBHB candidate 3C 66B, modeling the GWB as a common uncorrelated red noise. Using Bayesian methods, we perform targeted searches across two PTA data sets: Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves 15 years data set and the European Pulsar Timing Array DR2 full data set. We find no evidence of such signal in both data sets and then place upper limits on the amplitude of the signal and the chirp mass of the source. Additionally, we evaluate the case of a GWB characterized by Hellings-Downs correlations using a likelihood reweighting method, which consistently reconfirms the conclusion of non-detection.",

C Vol. 85, Issue 9, (2025) 1013 (13 pages) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this study, we explore the impact of various combinations of CMB-independent datasets, including the recent DESI BAO measurements, on the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy and other cosmological parameters within the framework of the dynamical dark energy model ($w$CDM). Assuming a constant EoS parameter for dark energy, we derive constraints on the free parameters of the model using observational datasets such as DESI BAO, BBN, Observational Hubble Data (OHD), and Pantheon Plus (SN$^+$) $\\&$ SH0ES. Our analysis examines the deviations of the $w$CDM model from the standard $\\Lambda$CDM scenario and assesses its implications for cosmological tensions, particularly the $H_0$ tension [$\\text{km} \\text{s}^{-1} \\text{Mpc}^{-1}$]. We find that the combination of DESI BAO + BBN + OHD + SN$^+$ (DESI BAO + BBN + OHD + SN$^+$ \\&SH0ES) datasets provides constraints on $w_{\\mathrm{de}0}$, suggesting a possible deviation from the cosmological constant scenario at a significance level of $1.6\\sigma$ ($1.4\\sigma$), respectively. Furthermore, we observe an inverse correlation between $w_{\\text{de0}}$ and $H_0$, which highlights the role of dark energy dynamics in resolving the tension $H_0$ by approximately $2.1\\sigma(0.8\\sigma)$ from DESI BAO + BBN + OHD (DESI BAO + BBN + OHD + SN$^+$ \\&SH0ES) datasets, respectively. Our findings offer valuable insights into the nature of dark energy and its influence on the cosmic expansion history, with implications for future observational efforts.

Mota Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) An independent determination of the Hubble constant is crucial in light of the persistent tension between early- and late-Universe measurements. In this study, we analyze the dynamics of the Centaurus A (CenA) and M83 galaxies, along with their associated dwarf companions identified via Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) distance measurements, to constrain both the group mass and the local value of $H_0$. By examining the motions of these galaxies relative to the system's barycenter, we apply both the minor and major infall models, which provide bounds on the true radial velocity dispersion. Averaging these approaches, we obtain a virial mass estimate of $(11 \\pm 2) \\times 10^{12}\\, M_{\\odot}$ and a Hubble flow-based mass of $(2.6 \\pm 1.1) \\times 10^{12}\\, M_{\\odot}$. Modeling the cold Hubble flow around the group center of mass, we derive a corresponding value of the Hubble constant as $68 \\pm 5~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$. These results offer an independent, dynamically motivated constraint on the local value of $H_0$, explicitly accounting for the impact of peculiar velocities in the nearby Universe. We also discuss the mild tension between the virial and Hubble flow-based mass estimates, which likely arises from the fact that M83 is close to the velocity surface and breaks the Hubble flow model assumptions. While the Hubble flow fit emphasizes galaxies that follow smooth expansion on the lower branch of the velocity-distance relation, the virial estimate includes the broader spread of bound galaxies near the group core, which seems to fit better for the CenA/M83 total mass.",

We consider asteroid, solar, and supermassive black hole seed masses. In each case, we simulate $10^8$ patches of the universe that may collapse into PBHs. In every patch, we follow $4\\times10^4$ momentum shells to construct its spherically symmetric profile from first principles, without introducing a window function. We include the effects of critical collapse and the radiation era transfer function. The resulting compaction function profiles are very spiky due to stochastic kicks. This can enhance the PBH abundance by up to 36 orders of magnitude, depending on the mass range and collapse criterion. The PBH mass function shifts to higher masses and widens significantly. These changes may have a large effect on observational constraints of PBHs and make it possible to generate PBHs with a smaller amplitude of the power spectrum. However, convergence issues for the mass function remain. The results call for redoing collapse simulations to determine the collapse criterion for spiky profiles.",

So, it is of interest to measure the Hubble constant by using some new probes independent of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae (SNIa). One of the promising probes is the fast radio bursts (FRBs), which could be useful in cosmology. In the literature, the methodology proposed by Macquart {\\it et al.} has been widely used, in which both $\\rm DM_{IGM}$ and $\\rm DM_{host}$ are described by probability distribution functions. Recently, it was found that in order to obtain a Hubble constant $H_0$ consistent with the ones of Planck 2018 and SH0ES by using the current ${\\cal O}(100)$ localized FRBs, an unusually large $f_{\\rm IGM}$ fairly close to its upper bound $1$ is required, if the narrow prior bounded by $0.5$ for the parameter $F$ in the distribution of $\\rm DM_{IGM}$ was used. In fact, a small $F$ is the key to make $H_0$ larger. In the present work, we consider a loose prior for the parameter $F$, and find an unusually low $H_0$ by using 125 localized FRBs. We show that the model with loose $F$ prior is strongly preferred over the one with narrow $F$ prior in all terms of the Bayesian evidence and the information criteria AIC, BIC. So, the great Hubble tension between FRBs, Planck 2018 and SH0ES should be taken seriously. Instead of modifying $\\sigma_\\Delta=Fz^{-0.5}$ in the distribution of $\\rm DM_{IGM}$, here we try to find a new way out by generalizing the distribution of $\\rm DM_{host}$ with varying location and scale parameters $\\ell$ and $e^\\mu$, respectively. We find that $H_0$ can be consistent with the ones of Planck 2018 and SH0ES in all cases. All the Bayesian evidence and the information criteria AIC, BIC for the generalized distributions of $\\rm DM_{host}$ are overwhelmingly strong.",

Using both model-independent reconstructions as well as different dark energy (DE) parameterizations, we show that these redshifts remain stable across cosmological models and reconstruction algorithm, making them reliable geometric anchors of the expansion history. Moreover, the Alcock-Paczyński corrections at these redshift anchors are found to be unity with high statistical significance, making them natural isotropy points in the comoving distance-redshift relation. We also find that certain redshifts anchors $(z < 1)$ coincide with epochs where strong deviations from the Planck $\\Lambda$CDM baseline are apparent irrespective of DE parametrisation like CPL or reconstruction algorithm, indicating their potential as probes of new physics in cosmological evolution. Finally, we demonstrate, for the first time, that a Raychaudhuri Equation Informed Reconstruction Algorithm, substantially enhances the precision of the inferred distance measures and the Hubble expansion rate as well as results tighter constraints in the DE parameter space. These results demonstrate that combining geometric reconstruction with physics-informed kinematic information offers a powerful and consistent algorithm to probe new physics in the late-time dynamics of our Universe.",

In this work, we adopt an improved inverse distance ladder approach based on the latest cosmological data to provide a model-independent perspective, employing a global parametrization based on cosmic age (PAge). Our analysis incorporates DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmic chronometer (CC) data, and type Ia supernovae (SNe) observations from either the DESY5 or PantheonPlus datasets. For the DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets, we obtain $H_0 = 67.91 \\pm 2.33~\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$. This value is consistent with the Planck 2018 result, while shows $2.0 \\sigma$ tension with the SH0ES measurement.

Closely connected with this is the real-time aspect associated with gravitational-wave interferometers and the astrophysical observations they perform; the discovery potential of these instruments can be significantly enhanced when data processing can be achieved in O(1s) timescales. In this work, we introduce a novel signal and noise identification tool based on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework. For its application into gravitational waves, we will refer to it as GW-YOLO. This tool can provide scene identification capabilities and essential information regarding whether an observed transient is any combination of noise and signal. Additionally, it supplies detailed time-frequency coordinates of the detected objects in the form of pixel masks, an essential property that can be used to understand and characterize astrophysical sources, as well as instrumental noise. The simultaneous identification of noise and signal, combined with precise pixel-level localization, represents a significant advancement in gravitational-wave data analysis. Our approach yields a 50\\% detection efficiency for binary black hole signals at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 15 when such signals overlap with transient noise artifacts. When noise artifacts overlap with binary neutron star signals, our algorithm attains 50\\% detection efficiency at an SNR of 30.

GWs from compact binary coalescences like Black Holes or Neutron Stars behave like standard sirens and can be used as cosmological probes. To this aim, generally, the observation of an electromagnetic counterpart and the measurement of the redshift are needed. However, even when those are not available, it is still possible to exploit these \"dark sirens\" via statistical methods. In this work, we explore a method that exploits the information contained in the cross-correlation of samples of GW events with matter over-density tracers like galaxy catalogues. Contrary to other currently employed dark-sirens methods, this approach does not suffer from systematic errors related to the incompleteness of the galaxy catalogue. To further enhance the technique, we implement tomography in redshift space for the galaxy catalogue and luminosity distance space for the GWs. We simulate future data collected by the array of currently existing detectors, namely LIGO, Virgo, and Kagra, as well as planned third-generation ones such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorers. We cross-correlate these data with those from upcoming photometric galaxy surveys such as Euclid. We perform a sensitivity forecast employing a full-likelihood approach and explore the parameter space with Monte Carlo Markov Chains. We find that with this method, third-generation detectors will be able to determine the Hubble constant $H_0$ with an error of only 0.7%, which is enough to provide decisive information to shed light on the Hubble tension. Furthermore, for the other cosmological parameters, we find that the GWs and galaxy surveys information are highly complementary, and the use of both significantly improves the ability to constrain the underlying cosmology.",

First, using the latest background dataset, we conduct a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis to constrain the free parameters of the models. Then, we assess the models against each other using the key background parameters and compare them to the $\\Lambda$CDM standard model. Our results show that at high redshifts, the equation of state (EoS) parameter related to the models for both homogeneous and clustered DE cases falls within the quintessence region. However, as we approach the present time, all models except HDE transition into the phantom region, and two models cross the phantom line earlier than others. In the next step, we focus on the evolution of perturbations in DE and DM. Using background and growth rate data, we constrain parameters including $\\sigma_8$. We then investigate the evolution of the growth rate of matter perturbations, $f\\sigma_8(z)$, and its deviation, $\\Delta f \\sigma_8$, from the $\\Lambda$CDM model. The HDE model shows the best agreement with observational data, while other models predict varying growth rates compared to $\\Lambda$CDM. Finally, we demonstrate through Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC and BIC) analysis that the compatibility of models with observational data depends on the type of data used, the DE-DM interaction term, and the assumptions regarding DE homogeneity and clustering. Our results suggest that homogeneous DE models yield more agreement with observational data than clustered DE models.",

Grazian First in a series of six papers presenting CLOE, the Euclid likelihood code; 27 pages, 10 figures, A&A submitted Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) As the statistical precision of cosmological measurements increases, the accuracy of the theoretical description of these measurements needs to increase correspondingly in order to infer the underlying cosmology that governs the Universe. To this end, we have created the Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in Euclid (CLOE), which is a novel cosmological parameter inference pipeline developed within the Euclid Consortium to translate measurements and covariances into cosmological parameter constraints. In this first in a series of six papers, we describe the theoretical recipe of this code for the Euclid primary probes. These probes are composed of the photometric 3x2pt observables of cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and galaxy clustering, along with spectroscopic galaxy clustering. We provide this description in both Fourier and configuration space for standard and extended summary statistics, including the wide range of systematic uncertainties that affect them. This includes systematic uncertainties such as intrinsic galaxy alignments, baryonic feedback, photometric and spectroscopic redshift uncertainties, shear calibration uncertainties, sample impurities, photometric and spectroscopic galaxy biases, as well as magnification bias. The theoretical descriptions are further able to accommodate both Gaussian and non-Gaussian likelihoods and extended cosmologies with non-zero curvature, massive neutrinos, evolving dark energy, and simple forms of modified gravity. These theoretical descriptions that underpin CLOE will form a crucial component in revealing the true nature of the Universe with next-generation cosmological surveys such as Euclid.",

Gillard Fourth in a series of six papers presenting CLOE, the Euclid likelihood code; 19 pages, 13 figures, submitted to A&A Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The Euclid satellite will provide data on the clustering of galaxies and on the distortion of their measured shapes, which can be used to constrain and test the cosmological model. However, the increase in precision places strong requirements on the accuracy of the theoretical modelling for the observables and of the full analysis pipeline. In this paper, we investigate the accuracy of the calculations performed by the Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in Euclid (CLOE), a software able to handle both the modelling of observables and their fit against observational data for both the photometric and spectroscopic surveys of Euclid, by comparing the output of CLOE with external codes used as benchmark. We perform such a comparison on the quantities entering the calculations of the observables, as well as on the final outputs of these calculations. Our results highlight the high accuracy of CLOE when comparing its calculation against external codes for Euclid observables on an extended range of operative cases. In particular, all the summary statistics of interest always differ less than $0.1\\,\\sigma$ from the chosen benchmark, and CLOE predictions are statistically compatible with simulated data obtained from benchmark codes. The same holds for the comparison of correlation function in configuration space for spectroscopic and photometric observables.",

Kümmel Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Euclid is expected to establish new state-of-the-art constraints on extensions beyond the standard LCDM cosmological model by measuring the positions and shapes of billions of galaxies. Specifically, its goal is to shed light on the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Achieving this requires developing and validating advanced statistical tools and theoretical prediction software capable of testing extensions of the LCDM model. In this work, we describe how the Euclid likelihood pipeline, Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in Euclid (CLOE), has been extended to accommodate alternative cosmological models and to refine the theoretical modelling of Euclid primary probes. In particular, we detail modifications made to CLOE to incorporate the magnification bias term into the spectroscopic two-point correlation function of galaxy clustering. Additionally, we explain the adaptations made to CLOE's implementation of Euclid primary photometric probes to account for massive neutrinos and modified gravity extensions. Finally, we present the validation of these CLOE modifications through dedicated forecasts on synthetic Euclid-like data by sampling the full posterior distribution and comparing with the results of previous literature. In conclusion, we have identified in this work several functionalities with regards to beyond-LCDM modelling that could be further improved within CLOE, and outline potential research directions to enhance pipeline efficiency and flexibility through novel inference and machine learning techniques.",

Optical flux ratios of lensed quasars are typically affected by stellar microlensing, and thus studies of dark matter substructure often rely on emission regions that are sufficiently extended to avoid microlensing effects. To expand the accessible wavelength range for studying dark matter substructure through flux ratios and to reduce reliance on specific instruments, we confront the challenges posed by microlensing and propose a method to detect dark matter substructure using optical flux ratios of lensed quasars. We select 100 strong lensing systems consisting of 90 doubles and 10 quads to represent the overall population and adopt the Kolmogorov--Smirnov (KS) test as our statistical method. By introducing different types of dark matter substructure into these strong lensing systems, we demonstrate that using quads alone provides the strongest constraints on dark matter and that several tens to a few hundred independent flux ratio measurements from quads can be used to study the properties of dark matter substructure and place constraints on dark matter parameters. Furthermore, we suggest that the use of multi-band flux ratios can substantially reduce the required number of quads. Such sample sizes will be readily available from ongoing and upcoming wide-field surveys.",

Gillis Third in a series of six papers presenting CLOE, the Euclid likelihood code; 39 pages, 21 figures, submitted to A&A Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The Euclid mission aims to measure the positions, shapes, and redshifts of over a billion galaxies to provide unprecedented constraints on the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Achieving this goal requires a continuous reassessment of the mission's scientific performance, particularly in terms of its ability to constrain cosmological parameters, as our understanding of how to model large-scale structure observables improves. In this study, we present the first scientific forecasts using CLOE (Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in Euclid), a dedicated Euclid cosmological pipeline developed to support this endeavour. Using advanced Bayesian inference techniques applied to synthetic Euclid-like data, we sample the posterior distribution of cosmological and nuisance parameters across a variety of cosmological models and Euclid primary probes: cosmic shear, angular photometric galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and spectroscopic galaxy clustering. We validate the capability of CLOE to produce reliable cosmological forecasts, showcasing Euclid's potential to achieve a figure of merit for the dark energy parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$ exceeding 400 when combining all primary probes. Furthermore, we illustrate the behaviour of the posterior probability distribution of the parameters of interest given different priors and scale cuts. Finally, we emphasise the importance of addressing computational challenges, proposing further exploration of innovative data science techniques to efficiently navigate the Euclid high-dimensional parameter space in upcoming cosmological data releases.",

Accepted for publication in PRD Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) One of the most important discoveries in cosmology is the accelerated expansion of the Universe. Yet, the accelerated expansion has only ever been measured {\\em in}directly. Redshift drift offers a direct observational probe of the Universe's expansion history, with its sign revealing whether there has been acceleration or deceleration between source and observer. Its detection will mark a major milestone in cosmology, offering the first direct measurement of an evolving expansion rate. Given its epistemic importance, it is essential to understand how its measurements can be biased. One possibility of bias comes from cosmological structures. However, theoretical estimates of such effects are difficult to obtain because computing redshift drift in general inhomogeneous cosmologies is computationally demanding, requiring the solution of 24 coupled ordinary differential equations. In this work, we use Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi Swiss-cheese models to show that only the two dominant contributions are needed to achieve percent-level accuracy up to $z = 1$. This allows the reduction of the full system of 24 ODEs to the standard null geodesic equations, significantly simplifying the calculation. \\newline\\indent Although our analysis is based on idealized Swiss-cheese models with spherical structures, we expect that similar simplifications apply to more complex scenarios, including cosmological N-body simulations. Our analysis thus underpins a practical and robust framework for efficient redshift drift computations applicable to a wider range of inhomogeneous cosmologies.",

We show that, for the Planck multipole range retained in combination with ground-based observations, different products give very similar cosmological solutions; small remaining differences are reduced by the addition of other CMB datasets to Planck. In particular, constraints on extended cosmological models benefit from the addition of small-scale power from ground-based experiments and are completely insensitive to the choice of Planck maps and likelihood. For this work we derive and release a nuisance-marginalized dataset and CamSpec-NPIPE-lite likelihood for the Planck NPIPE data injected into the CamSpec likelihood - which are usually used to obtain the reference Planck PR4 cosmology. Using the extracted CMB spectra we show that the additional constraining power for cosmology is coming from polarization at all scales and from temperature at multipoles above 1500 when going from PR3 to PR4. We also show that full marginalization over the CamSpec foreground nuisance parameters can impact parameter inference and model selections when truncating some scales; our new likelihood enables correct combinations with other CMB datasets.",

      "abstract": "Extending CSST Emulator to post-DESI era Zhao Chen, Yu Yu Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The recent DESI BAO measurements have revealed a potential deviation from a cosmological constant, suggesting a dynamic nature of dark energy. To rigorously test this result, complementary probes such as weak gravitational lensing are crucial, demanding highly accurate and efficient predictions of the nonlinear matter power spectrum within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. However, most existing emulators fail to cover the full parameter posterior from DESI DR2+CMB constraints in the $w_0\\mbox{-}w_a$ plane. In this work, we extend the spectral equivalence method outlined in Casarini et al. 2016 to use auxiliary $w_0w_a$CDM models for approximating the power spectrum of a target $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology, moving beyond the previous use of $w$CDM auxiliaries. Incorporating this enhanced module, the extended CSST Emulator achieves a prediction accuracy of $\\leq1\\%$ over the $1\\sigma$ confidence region from DESI DR2+CMB constraints for $z\\leq3$, validated by additional dynamic dark energy simulations. The emulator's applicable parameter space has been generalized to fully encompass the $2\\sigma$ region, greatly enhancing its utility for cosmological analysis in the post-DESI era.",

Comments are welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present constraints on the amplitude of matter fluctuations from the clustering of galaxies and their cross-correlation with the gravitational lensing convergence of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), focusing on low redshifts ($z\\lesssim0.3$), where potential deviations from a perfect cosmological constant dominating the growth of structure could be more prominent. Specifically, we make use of data from the 2MASS photometric survey (\\tmpz) and the \\wisc galaxy survey, in combination with CMB lensing data from \\planck. Using a hybrid effective field theory (HEFT) approach to model galaxy bias we obtain constraints on the combination $S_8=\\sigma_8\\sqrt{\\Omega_m/0.3}$, where $\\sigma_8$ is the amplitude of matter fluctuations, and $\\Omega_m$ is the non-relativistic matter fraction. Using a prior on $\\Omega_m$ based on the baryon acoustic oscillation measurements of DESI, we find $S_8=0.79\\pm0.06$, in reasonable agreement with CMB constraints. We also find that, in the absence of this prior, the data favours a value of $\\Omega_m=0.245\\pm0.024$, that is 2.8$\\sigma$ lower than \\planck. This result is driven by the broadband shape of the galaxy auto-correlation, and may be affected by theoretical uncertainties in the HEFT power spectrum templates. We further reconstruct the low-redshift growth history, finding it to be compatible with the \\planck predictions, as well as existing constraints from lensing tomography. Finally, we study our constraints on the HEFT bias parameters of the galaxy samples studied, finding them to be in reasonable agreement with coevolution predictions.",

Code available at this https URL Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Radio-interferometric arrays require very precise calibration to detect the Epoch of Reionization 21-cm signal. A remarkably complete and accurate sky model is therefore needed in the patches of the sky used to perform the calibration. Instruments such as HERA, which use a redundant calibration strategy, also require a reference sky model to fix degenerate gain solutions. We have carried out a deep (20 hours) observation using the upgraded GMRT to make a high-fidelity sky model of one of the HERA calibration fields GLEAM 02H (J0200$-$3053). Here, we present the results from a $16.7\\,\\rm{MHz}$ bandwidth data centred at $147.4\\,\\rm{MHz}$. Using multiple GMRT pointings, we have made a $6.9^\\circ\\times6.9^\\circ$ mosaic, which yields a median rms of $3.9^{+3.7}_{-1.4}\\,{\\rm mJy/beam}$ that reduces to $\\sim2\\,{\\rm mJy/beam}$ at source-free regions. In the overlapping patch, this rms is deeper than the GLEAM catalogue, which is used for HERA calibration. We produce a catalogue of $640$ sources ($26\\%$ extended) in the flux range $0.01-19.08\\,{\\rm Jy}$. The catalogue has a sub-arcsec positional accuracy, and the estimated fluxes are consistent with existing catalogues. The differential source counts are found to be deeper than GLEAM and consistent with LoTSS. Preliminary simulations of the sky models from GLEAM and our catalogue show $\\sim 10-25\\%$ difference in the visibility amplitude, with relatively small phase difference ($\\approx 2^\\circ$). Future work is planned for larger survey areas and wider bandwidth to reduce the rms and measure the in-band source spectral indices, which are expected to enhance the fidelity of the HERA calibration model.",

Feuillet, Ana Bonaca, Danielle de Brito Silva 8 figures, 15 pages, 1 appendix. Submitted to AAS Journals. Comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The Milky Way (MW) is thought to have experienced a $\\sim$3:1 mass-ratio merger event near redshift $z\\sim2$ with a significantly retrograde trajectory. This now-disrupted dwarf galaxy is commonly known as the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE). In this paper, we investigate the impact of the GSE merger trajectory on metal abundances in the MW disk. We construct numerical models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) incorporating radial gas flows to account for angular momentum transport during the merger event. Unlike prograde trajectories, radial and retrograde mergers are generally accompanied by a major sinking event in which much of the interstellar medium falls toward the Galactic center. This effect leads to a net decrease in surface density across much of the disk. Ongoing Type Ia supernova explosions then drive a rapid decline in [$\\alpha$/Fe] due to the lowered gas supply. Consequently, radial and retrograde trajectories increase (decrease) the number of low (high) [$\\alpha$/Fe] stellar populations relative to prograde trajectories. If high [$\\alpha$/Fe] stars form in sufficient numbers through other mechanisms, the effect of the retrograde trajectory can produce a bimodal [$\\alpha$/Fe] distribution at fixed [Fe/H], as observed in the MW. In models dominated by low [$\\alpha$/Fe] stellar populations, a bimodality does not arise because the retrograde trajectory cannot increase the number of high [$\\alpha$/Fe] stars. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of gas dynamics in GCE models featuring major merger events.",

Submitted to AAS Journals. Comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Star formation drives changes in the compositions of galaxies, fusing H and He into heavier nuclei. This paper investigates the differences in abundance evolution between metal and non-metal isotopes using recent models of Galactic chemical evolution appropriate for the thin disk epoch. A strong degeneracy arises between metal yields from stellar populations and the mean Galactocentric radial velocity of the interstellar medium (ISM). Similar metallicities arise when increases (decreases) in metal yields are combined with increases (decreases) to the gas flow velocity. A similar degeneracy exists between metal yields and the rate of gas ejection from the ISM. We demonstrate that this degeneracy can be confidently broken with precise measurements of the hydrogen (D/H) and helium ($^3$He/$^4$He) isotope ratios in the Galactic ISM. At fixed O/H, higher metal yields lead to higher D/H and lower $^3$He/$^4$He. Measurements available to date are not sufficiently precise or numerous to draw confident conclusions. A detailed inventory of non-metal isotopes in the Milky Way would provide critical empirical constraints for stellar and galactic astrophysics, as well as a new test of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We forecast that only $\\sim$4 additional measurements of $^3$He/$^4$He within $\\sim$$3$ kpc of the Sun are required to measure the primordial $^3$He/$^4$He ratio at $\\sim$30\\% precision. In parallel, empirical benchmarks on metal yields also have the power to inform stellar models, since absolute yield calculations carry factor of $\\sim$$2-3$ uncertainties related to various complex processes (e.g., rotational mixing, convection, mass loss, failed supernovae).",

We present JWST/NIRCam wide-field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) observations toward two of the most Ly$\\alpha$-transmissive QSO sightlines near the end of reionization. We find that regions at $z \\sim 5.7$ along both sightlines previously found to be low-density in Ly$\\alpha$ emitters are also underdense in [O III] emitters, with densities less than half the cosmic mean. Other transmissive regions, however, are found to coincide with average-density environments, indicating that multiple pathways may produce high IGM transmission. For the first time, we measure the two-dimensional cross-correlation between IGM transmission and galaxy positions, revealing evidence for anisotropic ionization geometry. Specifically, we detect enhanced transmission at transverse distances of $\\Delta r \\sim 0.8$ times the mean free path, consistent with ionizing photons escaping preferentially along large-scale structures that are aligned with, but offset from, the line of sight. This anisotropic escape may contribute to the observed patchiness of reionization and challenges the assumption of isotropic ionized bubble growth in current models.",

The evaporation of PBHs in such scenarios has the potential to place the universe into an extended period of \"stasis\" during which the abundances of matter and radiation remain absolutely constant despite cosmological expansion. This surprising phenomenon can give rise to new possibilities for early-universe dynamics and lead to distinctive signatures of the evaporation of such PBHs. In this paper, we discuss how this stasis epoch arises and explore a number of its phenomenological consequences, including implications for inflationary observables, the stochastic gravitational-wave background, baryogenesis, and the production of dark matter and dark radiation.",

A key method for probing this distribution is via weak gravitational lensing mass-mapping - a challenging ill-posed inverse problem where one infers the convergence field from observed shear measurements. Upcoming stage IV surveys, such as those made by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Euclid satellite, will provide a greater quantity and precision of data for lensing analyses, necessitating high-fidelity mass-mapping methods that are computationally efficient and that also provide uncertainties for integration into downstream cosmological analyses. In this work we introduce MMGAN, a novel mass-mapping method based on a regularised conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, which generates approximate posterior samples of the convergence field given shear data. We adopt Wasserstein GANs to improve training stability and apply regularisation techniques to overcome mode collapse, issues that otherwise are particularly acute for conditional GANs. We train and validate our model on a mock COSMOS-style dataset before applying it to true COSMOS survey data. Our approach significantly outperforms the Kaiser-Squires technique and achieves similar reconstruction fidelity as alternative state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. Notably, while alternative approaches for generating samples from a learned posterior are slow (e.g. requiring $\\sim$10 GPU minutes per posterior sample), MMGAN can produce a high-quality convergence sample in less than a second.",

Updated to match MNRAS version Mon Not R Astron Soc (2025) 1393-1409 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Cosmological information is encoded in the structure of galaxy clusters. In Universes with less matter and larger initial density perturbations, clusters form earlier and have more time to accrete material, leading to a more extended infall region. Thus, measuring the mean mass distribution in the infall region provides a novel cosmological test. The infall region is largely insensitive to baryonic physics, and provides a cleaner structural test than other measures of cluster assembly time such as concentration. We consider cluster samples from three publicly available galaxy cluster catalogues: the Spectroscopic Identification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) catalogue, the X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect selected clusters in the meta-catalogue M2C, and clusters identified in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Survey. Using a preliminary shape catalogue from the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), we derive excess surface mass density profiles for each sample. We then compare the mean profile for the DESI Legacy sample, which is the most complete, to predictions from a suite of simulations covering a range of $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ and $\\sigma_8$, obtaining constraints of $\\Omega_{\\rm m}=0.34\\pm 0.06$ and $\\sigma_8=0.77 \\pm 0.04$.

Performing this analysis with the final UNIONS shape catalogue and the full sample of spectroscopically observed clusters in DESI, we can expect to improve on the best current constraints from cluster abundance studies by a factor of 2 or more.",

The emulator relies on Gaussian Processes and Principal Component Analysis for efficient data compression and fast evaluation. Moreover, OLÉ features an automatic error estimation for optimal active sampling and online learning. All training data is computed on-the-fly, making the emulator applicable to any cosmological model or dataset. We illustrate the emulator's performance on an array of cosmological models and data sets, showing significant improvements in efficiency over similar emulators without degrading accuracy compared to standard theory codes. We find that OLÉ is able to considerably speed up the inference process, increasing the efficiency by a factor of $30-350$, including data acquisition and training. Typically the runtime of the likelihood code becomes the computational bottleneck. Furthermore, OLÉ emulators are differentiable; we demonstrate that, together with the differentiable likelihoods available in the $\\texttt{candl}$ library, we can construct a gradient-based sampling method which yields an additional improvement factor of 4.

Version accepted for publication in PRD Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Cosmological neutrino mass and abundance measurements are reaching unprecedented precision. Testing their stability versus redshift and scale is a crucial issue, as it can serve as a guide for optimizing ongoing and future searches. Here, we perform such analyses, considering a number of redshift, scale, and redshift-and-scale nodes. Concerning the $k$-space analysis of $\\sum m_\\nu$, CMB observations are crucial, as they lead the neutrino mass constraints. Interestingly, some data combinations suggest a non-zero value for the neutrino mass with $2\\sigma$ significance. The most constraining bound we find is $\\sum m_\\nu<0.54$ eV at $95\\%$ CL in the $[10^{-3}, 10^{-2}]$ $h$/Mpc $k$-bin, a limit that barely depends on the data combination. Regarding the redshift- and scale-dependent neutrino mass constraints, high redshifts ($z>100$) and scales in the range $[10^{-3}, 10^{-1}]$ $h$/Mpc provide the best constraints. The least constraining bounds are obtained at very low redshifts $[0,0.5]$ and also at very small scales ($k>0.1\\, h$/Mpc), due to the absence of observations. Highly relevant is the case of the $[100, 1100]$, $[10^{-2}, 10^{-1}]$ $h$/Mpc redshift-scale bin, where a $2$-$3\\sigma$ evidence for a non-zero neutrino mass is obtained for all data combinations. The bound from CMB alone at $68\\%$ CL is $0.63^{+0.20}_{-0.24}$ eV, and the one for the full dataset is $0.56^{+0.20}_{-0.23}$ eV, clearly suggesting a non-zero neutrino mass at these scales, possibly related to a deviation of the ISW amplitude in this redshift range. Concerning the analysis of $N_{\\rm eff}$ in the $k$-space, at intermediate scales ranging from $k=10^{-3}$ $h$/Mpc to $k=10^{-1}$ $h$/Mpc, accurate CMB data provide very strong bounds, the most robust one being $N_{\\rm eff}=3.09\\pm 0.14$, comparable to the standard expected value without a $k$-bin analysis.

Upcoming wide-field millimeter-wave surveys such as the Simons Observatory (SO), Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope, and CMB-S4 will make increasingly precise measurements of the SZ effect and its relativistic corrections. We present simulated full-sky maps of the rSZ effect and a fast code to generate it, for use in the development of analysis techniques and pipelines. As part of the websky simulation suite, our mock observations have semi-realistic cross-correlations with other large-scale structure tracers, offering insights into the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters and large-scale structure. As a demonstration of this, we examine what an SO-like experiment can learn from the rSZ effect. We find that high significance detections will be possible, provided that the instrumental systematics are under control, and that the evolution of cluster temperatures with mass and redshift can be probed in a manner complementary to X-ray measurements.",

Minor changes, updated references, and an appendix added. Final version as published in JCAP Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Recent analyses joining data from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) have provided strong evidence in favor of dynamical dark energy (DDE) over a simple cosmological constant. Motivated by these findings, we present new observational constraints on DDE based on the cross-correlation between DESI Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG) samples and CMB lensing ($\\mathrm{CMB}_{\\kappa} \\times \\mathrm{LRG}$), which effectively probes the impact of cosmological parameters on the growth of structure at the perturbative level. We demonstrate that, when combined with geometric measurements such as BAO and SNIa, this cross-correlation yields compelling statistical evidence for DDE exceeding $4\\sigma$, including within simpler parametrizations such as the $w$CDM model. Remarkably, this evidence is independent of constraints from primary Planck CMB anisotropies data. These results highlight the robustness and potential of Galaxy-CMB lensing cross-correlation as a powerful observational probe of the dark sector, particularly when used in conjunction with geometric observables.",

One possible application of such a framework is as a fast, approximate alternative to cosmological simulations, which would be particularly useful in various contexts, including covariance studies, investigations of systematics, and cosmological parameter inference. To investigate different aspects of learning-based cosmological mappings, we choose two approaches for generating suitable cosmological matter fields as datasets: a simple analytical prescription provided by the Zel'dovich approximation, and a numerical N-body method using the Particle-Mesh approach. The evolution of structure formation is modeled using U-Net, a widely employed convolutional image translation framework. Because of the lack of a controlled methodology, validation of these learned mappings requires multiple benchmarks beyond simple visual comparisons and summary statistics. A comprehensive list of metrics is considered, including higher-order correlation functions, conservation laws, topological indicators, and statistical independence of density fields. We find that the U-Net approach performs well only for some of these physical metrics, and accuracy is worse at increasingly smaller scales, where the dynamic range in density is large. By introducing a custom density-weighted loss function during training, we demonstrate a significant improvement in the U-Net results at smaller scales. This study provides an example of how a family of physically motivated benchmarks can, in turn, be used to fine-tune optimization schemes -- such as the density-weighted loss used here -- to significantly enhance the accuracy of scientific machine learning approaches by focusing attention on relevant features.",

Weaverdyck 24 pages, 16 figures, submitting to AAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Observations of density variations in stellar streams are a promising probe of low-mass dark matter substructure in the Milky Way. However, survey systematics such as variations in seeing and sky brightness can also induce artificial fluctuations in the observed densities of known stellar streams. These variations arise because survey conditions affect both object detection and star-galaxy misclassification rates. To mitigate these effects, we use Balrog synthetic source injections in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 data to calculate detection rate variations and classification rates as functions of survey properties. We show that these rates are nearly separable with respect to survey properties and can be estimated with sufficient statistics from the synthetic catalogs. Applying these corrections reduces the standard deviation of relative detection rates across the DES footprint by a factor of five, and our corrections significantly change the inferred linear density of the Phoenix stream when including faint objects. Additionally, for artificial streams with DES like survey properties we are able to recover density power spectra with reduced bias. We also find that uncorrected power-spectrum results for LSST-like data can be around five times more biased, highlighting the need for such corrections in future ground based surveys.",

Yadav 16 Pages, 8 Figures, 7 Tables, Accepted in Astroparticle Physics Journal High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the \\emph{Fermi} Gamma-ray Space Telescope has been continuously providing good quality survey data of the entire sky in the high energy range from 30 MeV to 500 GeV and above since August 2008. A succession of gamma-ray source catalogs is published after a comprehensive analysis of the \\emph{Fermi}--LAT data. The most recent release of data in the fourth \\emph{Fermi}--LAT catalog of gamma-ray sources (4FGL-DR4), based on the first 14 years of observations in the energy band 50 MeV-1 TeV, contains 7195 sources. A large fraction ($\\sim$ 33\\%) of this population has no known counterparts in the lower wave bands. Such high energy gamma-ray sources are referred to as unassociated or unidentified. An appropriate classification of these objects into known type of gamma-ray sources such as the active galactic nuclei or pulsars is essential for population studies and pointed multi-wavelength observations to probe the radiative processes. In this work, we perform a detailed classification of the unassociated sources reported in the 4FGL-DR4 catalog using two supervised machine learning techniques-Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting. We mainly focus on the identification of new gamma-ray pulsar candidates by making use of different observational features derived from the long-term observations with the \\emph{Fermi}--LAT and reported in the incremental 4FGL-DR4 catalog. We also explore the effects of data balancing approach on the classification of the \\emph{Fermi}--LAT unassociated sources.",

Deconfinement is triggered once the central density exceeds a critical threshold above $\\sim 3n_0$ being $n_0$, saturation density. We use descriptions based on DD2 and the MIT Bag model equations of state (EOSs). We account for neutrinos using a microphysics forward emission model including $e^-e^+$ annihilation, plasmon decay, nucleon (N) modified (or direct) Urca processes, and $NN$ bremsstrahlung, and, for the post transition, the quark direct Urca and an opacity-based leakage scheme with GR redshift. We find that the neutrino light curve generically develops a short $\\simeq$10-50 ms, spectrally harder feature near deconfinement, appearing as either a prompt shoulder or a distinct secondary peak. Heavy lepton neutrinos result in a delayed peak with respect to the previous. We identify three diagnostics that are only mildly degenerate with hadronic uncertainties: (i) an enhanced peak-to-plateau ratio $R_{\\rm pp}$ sourced by latent-heat release, (ii) a characteristic lag $\\Delta t$ between the collapse rise and the HQPT feature that tracks the central density trajectory, and (iii) a flavor hardening $\\Delta\\!\\langle E_\\nu\\rangle$ driven by quark-matter phase space. After MSW flavor conversion, these signatures remain detectable with current experiments. For a Galactic event ($d\\sim 10$ kpc), IceCube and Hyper-K should resolve the HQPT feature and distinguish it from both no transition NS collapse and canonical core-collapse supernova (CCSN) templates.",

Here, we extend this technique to the visibility domain and introduce the visibility amplitude pattern speed $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{VA}}$. We show that in the Illinois v3 library of EHT source models, $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{VA}}$ depends on the source inclination, black hole mass, black hole spin, accretion state (MAD or SANE), and baseline length, and then provide approximate fits for this dependence. We show that $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{VA}}$ is particularly sensitive to baseline length for MAD (strongly magnetized) models, and that the slope of this dependence can be used to constrain black hole spin. As with $\\Omega_p$, models predict that $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{VA}}$ is well below the Keplerian frequency in the emission region for all model parameters. This is consistent with the idea that $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{VA}}$ measures an angular phase speed for waves propagating through the emission region.

Accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a time-averaged spectral analysis of the 2024 XRISM observation of the narrow-line Seyfert-1 galaxy MCG--6-30-15, taken contemporaneously with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. Our analysis leverages a unique combination of broadband and high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy to definitively isolate and characterize both broad and narrow emission and absorption features in this source. The best-fitting model for the joint spectral analysis is very well described by reflection from the inner accretion disk illuminated by a compact corona, modified by multi-zone ionized absorption from an outflowing wind along the line of sight. The XRISM/Resolve data confirm that a strong, relativistically-broadened Fe K$\\alpha$ emission line is required in order to obtain an adequate model fit. The Resolve data additionally verify the presence of a $v_{\\rm out} \\sim 2300$ km/s component of this outflowing wind, find tentative evidence for a $v_{\\rm out} \\sim 20,000$ km/s wind component, and indicate that the reflection from distant, neutral material may originate in a non-uniform structure rather than the traditional torus of AGN unification schemes. Though a rapid prograde black hole spin is statistically preferred by the best-fitting model, consistent with previous results, the AGN flux variability over the course of the observation complicates the interpretation of the time-averaged spectra. This insight, clarified by the combination of high signal-to-noise and high spectral resolution in the joint dataset, emphasizes the importance of time-resolved, high-resolution spectral analysis in unambiguously measuring the physical properties of variable AGN.",

The dataset comprises 48 drift-scan observations from the MWA Voltage Capture System, covering approximately 30,000 square degrees of sky with sensitivities reaching about 8 mJy in the deepest regions. An optimized PRESTO-based search pipeline was deployed on the China SKA Regional Centre infrastructure. This enabled the detection of 80 known pulsars, representing a 60 percent increase over the previous census. Notably, this includes 30 pulsars with first-time detections at this frequency, of which pulse profiles and flux densities are presented. Spectral, scattering, and pulse-width properties were examined for the sample, providing observational constraints on low-frequency turnover, propagation effects, and width-period relations. This study highlights the value of wide-field, low-frequency time-domain surveys for constraining pulsar emission and propagation, offering empirical insights that may inform future observations with instruments such as SKA-Low.",

We use a Monte-Carlo method to inject outflows with uniform mass outflow rate and momentum, in a conical funnel with a specific half opening angle. Simulation results show that the morphology of the bubble is determined by the initial momentum of the outflows, while the mechanical power of the outflows only influences the size of the bubble without changing its shape. Low mechanical power also results in a short cooling timescale of the system, leading to an early collapse of the bubble shell. The half opening angle of the outflows and the viewing angle of the system determine the observed bubble eccentricity together. Compared with the observational morphology of the ULX bubble sources NGC 55 ULX-1 and NGC 1313 X-2, our simulation favors the fact that the high velocity outflows of the accretion disks in these two systems are confined in a narrow funnel region.",

Ultrahigh energy neutrinos and gamma-rays are co-produced in ultrahigh energy cosmic-ray interactions. The ultrahigh energy gamma-rays produced alongside the KM3NeT neutrino may quickly cascade down to lower energies due to interactions with intergalactic photons and magnetic fields. Because of this, the KM3NeT neutrino could be accompanied by an observable GeV - TeV gamma-ray signal. We investigate the data collected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on-board the \\textit{Fermi} Gamma-ray Space Telescope for transient and sub-threshold gamma-ray sources in the vicinity of the KM3NeT neutrino. We find three sub-threshold sources with TS $\\gtrsim 16$ within $3.5^{\\circ}$ of the neutrino event not included in any existing \\textit{Fermi}-LAT catalogs. One of the three, J0616.1-0428, is a transient sub-threshold gamma-ray source that appears only after the neutrino observation, but may be the unrelated flaring of a nearby microquasar. Another sub-threshold source, J0621.1-0610, also exhibits fluctuations in gamma-rays immediately following the neutrino observation, and may be coincident with a radio blazar. We note that the number of sub-threshold sources observed around the KM3NeT neutrino could be expected at another sky region of the same Galactic latitude, and that the fluctuations they exhibit appear to be consistent with background.",

Gillanders High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The extremely rapid evolution of kilonovae results in spectra that change on an hourly basis. These spectra are key to understanding the processes occurring within the event, but this rapid evolution is an unfamiliar domain compared to other explosive transient events, such as supernovae. In particular, the most obvious P Cygni feature in the spectra of AT2017gfo -- commonly attributed to strontium -- possesses an emission component that emerges after, and ultimately outlives, its associated absorption dip. This delay is theorised to arise from reverberation effects, wherein photons emitted earlier in the kilonova's evolution are scattered before reaching the observer, causing them to be detected at later times. We aim to examine how the finite speed of light -- and therefore the light travel time to an observer -- contributes to the shape and evolution of spectral features in kilonovae. Using a simple model, and tracking the length of the journey photons undertake to an observer, we are able to test the necessity of accounting for this time delay effect when modelling kilonovae. In periods where the photospheric temperature is rapidly evolving, we show spectra synthesised using a time independent approach are visually distinct from those where these time delay effects are accounted for. Therefore, in rapidly evolving events such as kilonovae, time dependence must be taken into account.",

Current large-scale, high-cadence surveys, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), provide detections of new and rare types of transients and supernovae whose physical origins are not well understood. Aims. We investigate the nature of SN 2021lwz at a redshift z=0.065, an overluminous supernova (SN) of absolute magnitude, $M_{g} \\sim -20.1$ AB, falling in the lower range of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) luminosities, and discovered in a faint dwarf galaxy with an absolute magnitude of $M_{g} \\simeq -14.5$ AB. Methods. SN 2021lwz is studied using optical spectroscopy, photometry and imaging linear polarimetry obtained during several follow-up campaigns. All the data are used to analyse and model the evolution of the explosion. Comparisons with other SNe of well known or rarer types are investigated. Results. SN 2021lwz belongs to the rare class of rapidly evolving transients. The bolometric light curve rises in about 7 days to a peak luminosity of about 5 x10^{43} erg/s, at a rate of 0.2 mag/day close to the peak. Spectroscopy modeling reveals more similarities with a normal Type Ic-like SN than with a SLSN before peak, showing broadened lines after peak. Light curve modeling shows that the Arnett model of the bolometric light curve using a radioactive source ($^{56}$ Ni) is not able to reasonably explain the light curve evolution. A magnetar model seems more appropriate, suggesting that the explosion of low ejecta mass ($M_{\\rm ej} \\sim 0.24 ~M_\\odot$) took place in a low mass ($M \\sim 10^{6.66}~M_\\odot$) dwarf galaxy of specific star-formation rate about ten times larger than typical star-forming galaxies. Conclusions. Given its spectroscopic properties and the low ejecta mass needed to model its light-curve, SN 2021lwz does not match with many core-collapse H-poor SNe Types. It shares similarities with rarer transients like SN 2014ft, iPTF 16asu and SN 2018gep.",

They can be identified as quasars with periodic variability in electromagnetic (EM) time-domain surveys. The most massive of those systems can be detected by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) in the nanohertz frequency gravitational-wave (GW) band. We present a method to simultaneously analyze EM lightcurves and PTA observations as a multi-messenger data stream. For this, we employ a joint likelihood analysis, in which the likelihood of the EM data and the PTA likelihood are multiplied. We test this approach by simulating 208 binary signals that can be detected both by the Rubin Observatory in the nominal ten-year survey and by a PTA dataset with a ~30-year baseline, which resembles our expectations for a dataset of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) collaboration in ~2035. We compare our multi-messenger analysis with analyses that take into account the EM and PTA data separately. We find that the joint likelihood approach results in improved parameter estimation with smaller percent errors compared to the distinct analyses that consider only EM or PTA data separately. Among the SMBHB parameters, the binary total mass and the orbital inclination show the greatest improvement. We also compare our multi-messenger pipeline with an analysis, in which the EM constraints are used as priors to the PTA analysis. We demonstrate that the joint likelihood approach delivers tighter constraints on all binary parameters, with systematically higher values of Kullback-Leibler divergence, which measures the deviation of the posterior distribution from the prior.",

In this work, we investigate both current and vorticity sheets in 3D particle-in-cell simulations of decaying relativistic turbulence in pair plasma by training a self-organizing map to recognize these structures. We subsequently carry out an extensive statistical analysis to reveal their geometric and structural properties. This analysis is systematically applied across a range of magnetizations ($\\sigma$) and fluctuating-to-mean magnetic field strengths ($\\delta B_0/B_0$) to assess how these parameters influence the resulting structures. We find that the structures' geometric properties form power-law distributions in their probability density functions (PDFs), with the exception of the structure width, which generally exhibits an exponential distribution peaking around 2 electron skin depths. The measurements show weak dependence on $\\sigma$ but a strong dependence on $\\delta B_0/B_0$. Finally, we investigate the spatial relationship between current sheets and vorticity sheets. We find that most current sheets are directly associated with at least one vorticity sheet neighbor and are often situated between two vorticity sheets. These findings provide a detailed statistical framework for understanding the formation and organization of coherent structures in relativistic magnetized turbulence, allowing for their incorporation into updated theoretical models for structure-based energy dissipation and particle acceleration processes crucial for interpreting high-energy astrophysical observations.",

However, the determination is complicated by MSPs' long-term dynamic evolution and the scarcity of radial velocity measurements. We compiled 64 field MSP systems that are well astrometrically determined, and calculated their transverse peculiar velocities $\\boldsymbol{v}_\\perp$ and Galactic heights $z$. Assuming that the Galactic-longitude components $v_\\mathrm{l}$ of $\\boldsymbol{v}_\\perp$ are statistically stable over time (the \"stable-$v_\\mathrm{l}$\" assumption), we approached the distribution of the $v_\\mathrm{l}$ components of $\\boldsymbol{v}_\\mathrm{sys}$ by the observed $v_\\mathrm{l}$ sample. We find that the observed $v_\\mathrm{l}$ can be well described by a linear combination of three normal distributions. Accordingly, the MSP $v_\\mathrm{sys}$ distribution can be approximated by a linear combination of three Maxwellian components under the assumption that $\\boldsymbol{v}_\\mathrm{sys}$ directions are uniformly distributed. Our dynamical population synthesis analysis based on the derived $v_\\mathrm{sys}$ distribution verified the \"stable-$v_\\mathrm{l}$\" assumption in the parameter space of this work, and estimated the initial and the current Galaxy-wide scale heights of field MSP systems to be about 0.32 kpc and 0.68 kpc, respectively. According to the MSP $v_\\mathrm{sys}$ distribution, $\\approx14$% of all the MSPs born in a globular cluster with the nominal 50 $\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ central escape velocity can be retained. Therefore, the $v_\\mathrm{sys}$ distribution of field MSP systems may account for the high number of MSPs discovered in globular clusters, which implies that MSPs in star clusters may follow the same formation channel(s) as field MSP systems.",

Previous hydrodynamical simulations have shown that ambient gas can significantly influence the dynamics of BSIs. However, due to limitations such as the use of purely Newtonian dynamics and small sample sizes, a direct estimation of the BBH merger probability during BSI has remained elusive. In this work, we directly quantify the merger probability, based on a suite of 1800 two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations coupled with post-Newtonian \\emph{N}-body calculations. Our results demonstrate that dense gas can enhance the merger probability by both shrinking the spatial scale of the triple system and increasing the number of binary-single encounters. These two effects together boost the merger probability by a factor of $\\sim$5, from 4\\% to as high as 20\\%. Among the two effects, our analysis suggests that the increase in encounter frequency plays a slightly more significant role in driving the enhancement. Moreover, this enhancement becomes more significant at larger radial distances from the central SMBH, since the total gas mass enclosed within the Hill sphere of the triple system increases with radius. Finally, the BSI process in AGN disks can naturally produce double GW merger events within a timescale of $\\sim$year, which may serve as potential observational signatures of BSI occurring in AGN disk environments.",

Accepted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Numerous core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) exhibit signatures of interaction with circumstellar material (CSM). Bright radio emission years after the SN is one such indication of dense CSM at large distances from the star, which may be generated via binary interactions. In this work, we use forward modeling to study the radio emission produced by interaction between the SN ejecta and CSM formed by non-conservative stable mass transfer from stripped-envelope stars in short-period binaries. The donors are among the likely progenitors of hydrogen-poor CCSNe that significantly expand $10^3$-$10^4$ years before core-collapse, with companions that best represent low-mass compact objects. We identify that non-conservative stable mass transfer from lower-mass stripped stars can create a detached shell-like CSM, whereas for our higher-mass stars the CSM is wind-like. In our models, mass transfer rates of $\\sim 10^{-4} M_\\odot$ $\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ lead to dense CSM extending to $\\sim 10^{18}$ $\\mathrm{cm}$. The predicted radio emission is luminous at late times, reaching $L_{\\nu}\\sim10^{26}$-$10^{29}\\mathrm{erg}$ $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$ at years to decades after core-collapse, which is as bright as late-time radio emission observed for a sample of hydrogen-poor SNe. However, the light curves of events with early-time data show more complex behavior in the weeks to months after core-collapse. We qualitatively demonstrate that similar early-time emission can manifest for CSM that is accelerated to speeds of $\\sim10^3$ $\\mathrm{km}$ $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ upon ejection, as well as for different viewing angles in case of an asymmetric CSM distribution.",

Accepted for publication in A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Aims. The accretion disk of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) is a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF). Our goal is to find evidence of RIAF radiation from LLAGNs with jets and analyze their radiation properties, which also adds samples to future research on LLAGNs. Methods. Weconducted an analysis of the X-ray data obtained from NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations of NGC 315 and NGC 4261, encompassing both timing and spectral investigations. The joint X-ray spectra of the two LLAGNs were fitted using various functional forms and radiative models in XSPEC. Results. No significant variability on timescales of days is observed for both NGC 315 and NGC 4261. The X-ray continuum emission of NGC 315 is suitable for cutoff power-law (PL) fitting, yielding a cutoff energy of Ecut = 18.45 keV, which is the lowest value found in LLAGNssofar. In contrast, the X-ray continuum of NGC 4261 is composed of two PL components, with no signs of a cutoff energy. A prominent neutral Fe K{\\alpha} line is observed in NGC 315, while an ionized Fe XXV line is seen in NGC 4261. The derived reflection fractions are R = 0.61 for NGC 315 and R = 0.18 for NGC 4579. Neither NGC 315 nor NGC 4261 shows evidence of a Compton reflection bump. Conclusions. The X-ray spectral characteristics support the RIAF emission as the dominant origin of the X-rays in both sources, although an additional soft PL component originating from the inner jet is observed in NGC 4261. The higher reflection fraction compared to other LLAGNs, along with the detection of a neutral Fe K{\\alpha} line, suggests the existence of a truncated accretion disk with a relatively small radius in NGC 315. Bremsstrahlung radiation appears to be the dominant cooling mechanism for the plasma in NGC315, while Comptonization within the RIAF is more likely responsible for the X-ray emission in NGC 4261.",

We created an innovative dynamical model with minimal assumptions on the internal dynamical structures and accommodates a highly flexible triaxial DM halo. By applying the method to 6D phase-space data of K-giant stars from LAMOST + Gaia, we robustly determine the 3D dark-matter distribution of the Milky Way out to approximately 50 kpc. We discover a triaxial, nearly oblate dark-matter halo with $q_{\\rm DM} = Z/X= 0.92\\pm0.08$, $p_{\\rm DM} = Y/X= 0.8\\pm0.2$ averagely within 50 kpc, where $Z$ axis is defined perpendicular to the stellar disk. The axes ratio $q_{\\rm DM} > p_{\\rm DM}$ is strongly preferred; the long-intermediate axis plane of the dark-matter halo is unexpectedly vertical to the Galactic disk, yet aligned with the `plane of satellites'. This striking configuration suggests that the Galactic disk has flipped, likely torqued by minor mergers, from an original alignment with the dark-matter halo and satellite plane, as supported by Milky Way analogues from Auriga and TNG 50. By allowing $q_{\\rm DM}(r)$ and $p_{\\rm DM}(r)$ vary with radii, we find tentative evidence that the dark-matter halo is twisted, being more oblate in the inner regions, and only become vertically aligned at $r\\gtrsim 20$ kpc, also consistent with the prediction of the disk flip scenario.

Our findings offer a unified framework that links dark-matter halo orientation, satellite alignment, and disk evolution, reinforcing the internal consistency of the Milky Way in $\\Lambda$CDM model.",

Alongside these data, we also include ancillary HST imaging in seven filters from 0.435$\\mu$m to 1.6$\\mu$m. We used Source Extractor with hot and cold detection settings to extract photometry. We derive photometric redshifts using the spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling code, LePHARE, and estimate their accuracy using spectroscopically confirmed galaxies out to $z\\sim10$, with $\\sigma_{NMAD}$ ranging from 0.035-0.073, depending strongly on galaxy magnitude and redshift. We compute stellar masses, star formation rates, and E(B-V) using three different SED fitting codes with different templates and assumptions about the galaxy star formation histories.

While there is no correlation between the quenched fraction and angular separation from the cluster's overall center of mass, there is a correlation between the quenched fraction and angular separation from the center of the nearest of the two mass components for the less-massive galaxies.

Vaughan, Jack Sayers, Locke Spencer, Nicholas Swidinksi, Ryan Wills, Michael Zemcov, Derek Arthur, Victoria Butler, Richard M. Feder, Daniel Klyde, Lorenzo Lovisari, Adam Mantz, Emily M. Silich Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The conversion of gravitational potential to kinetic energy results in an intracluster medium (ICM) gas with a characteristic temperature near 10 keV in the most massive galaxy clusters. X-ray observations, primarily from Chandra and XMM-Newton, have revealed a wealth of information about the thermodynamics of this gas. However, two regimes remain difficult to study with current instruments: superheated gas well above 10~keV generated by shocks from major mergers, and distant systems strongly impacted by cosmological dimming. Relativistic corrections to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (rSZe) produce a fractional spectral distortion in the cosmic microwave background at sub-millimeter and millimeter wavelengths that could offer a complimentary probe of both high temperature and high redshift ICM gas. Here we describe multi-band measurements of the rSZe, including observations from the Fourier Transform Spectrometer on the Herschel-SPIRE instrument, that constrain the ICM thermodynamics of the major merger MACSJ0717.5+3745. Within the seven observed lines of sight, we find an average temperature of $T_{\\mathrm{rSZe}}=15.1^{+3.8}_{-3.3}$ keV, which is consistent with the values obtained from X-ray measurements of the same regions, with $T_{\\mathrm{Chandra}}=18.0^{+1.1}_{-1.1}$ keV and $T_{\\mathrm{XMM}}=13.9^{+0.9}_{-0.9}$ keV. This work demonstrates that the rSZe signal can be detected with moderate spectral resolution sub-millimeter data, while also establishing the utility of such measurements for probing superheated regions of the ICM.",

We present an analysis of the spectral properties of 203 low-redshift CL-AGNs ($z<0.35$) using two-epoch spectra from SDSS DR16 and DESI DR1 with time baseline ranging from $\\sim$1000 to 8000 days, based on spectral fitting and decomposition. The sample consists of 11.3\\% Type 1.0, 26.6\\% Type 1.2, 43.1\\% Type 1.5, and 19\\% Type 1.8/2.0 AGNs. The total sample is divided into two datasets: Dataset A (110 objects) with minor spectral type variations, likely general AGN variability, and Dataset B (93 objects) showing significant type transitions and characteristic turn-on or turn-off behavior. Our results reveal clear optical continuum and emission-line variability, showing both bluer-when-brighter and redder-when-brighter trends. A strong correlation between the broad H$\\beta$/[O~{\\sc iii}] ratio and broad H$\\alpha$ luminosity ($L_{\\rm H\\alpha}$), ${\\rm log(H\\beta/[O~III])}=(0.63\\pm 0.07){\\rm log}(L_{\\rm H\\alpha})-(26.49\\pm2.96)\\pm0.48$ for Dataset B, as well as the correlation between H$\\beta$/[O~{\\sc iii}] and Eddington ratio ($L_{\\rm bol}/L_{\\rm Edd}$), ${\\rm log(H\\beta/[O~III])}=(0.59\\pm 0.08){\\rm log}(L_{\\rm bol}/L_{\\rm Edd})+(1.02\\pm0.15)\\pm0.53$ for Dataset B, suggests that accretion rate variations drive changes in ionizing flux within the broad-line region, thereby triggering AGN type transitions. These findings underscore the critical role of supermassive black hole accretion processes in refining the AGN unification model. Future work should investigate potential connections between stellar evolution in outer accretion disk and the observed scatter in these correlations.",

We analytically study tidal forces from cold molecular clouds as a key mechanism for accelerated cluster disruption. Cloud tides, caused by the gravitational pull of the parent cloud along the radial direction, arise from the spatial gradient of gravitational acceleration and drive cluster disruption. This mechanism activates after gas expulsion and remains effective until the cloud is disrupted by stellar feedback or the cluster moves away. Cloud tides act on gas-deprived clusters, causing exponential expansion on a tidal timescale of $t_{\\rm tidal,ext} = \\sqrt{3/(8\\pi G\\rho_{\\rm mean})}$, where $\\rho_{\\rm mean}$ is the cloud's density at the cluster's location. With a duration of a few Myr, cloud tides can lead to a 10 times increase of the cluster size, producing bar-like elongated stellar aggregations resembling Gaia strings. These results establish cloud tides as a potentially important mechanism for star cluster disruption.",

These new observations were conducted through the Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey of Nebulae (MRS-N) on the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). Comprehensive analyses were performed on a total of 3854 high-quality nebular spectra, so far the most extensive spectral dataset available for this nebula that encompasses an area of 4.52 square degrees. Various physical parameters, including relative line intensities, radial velocities (RVs), and full widths at half maximum (FWHMs), were derived through measurements of the H-alpha, [N II] 6548,6584 and [S II] 6716,6731 emission lines detected in the LAMOST MRS-N spectra. For the first time, we found a bow-shaped feature in the spatial distribution of RVs of the Rosette Nebula. Moreover, the spatial distributions of RVs and FWHMs, as well as additional parameters such as gas temperature and turbulent velocity in the vicinity of the nebula, indicate possible interaction between Rosette and the nearby supernova remnant (SNR), Monoceros Loop. Our new observations provide indispensable measurements of the Rosette Nebula. The parameter table in particular can be used as valuable constraint on the chemo-dynamical modeling of the nebula, which will enable deeper understanding of the characteristics of this H II region.",

Ho, Qianqiao Zhou, Xiangcheng Ma, Hu Zhan, Andrew Wetzel, Russell L. Graf, Philip F. Hopkins, Dusan Keres, Jonathan Stern Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We employ the high-redshift suite of FIRE-2 cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations to investigate the evolution of gas-phase metallicity radial gradients in galaxies in the epoch of reionization (EoR). Our sample consists of 22 galaxies spanning the redshift range $z \\sim 10-5$. We find that galaxies at $z\\sim10$ exhibit a median metallicity gradient of $-0.15\\,\\mathrm{dex\\cdot kpc^{-1}}$ with substantial scatter, which gradually flatten to $-0.1\\,\\mathrm{dex\\cdot kpc^{-1}}$ at $z\\sim6$, accompanied by a reduction in scatter. In the EoR, metallicity gradients correlate positively with stellar mass: more massive galaxies display flatter gradients with smaller scatter, broadly consistent with recent JWST observations. At fixed stellar mass, galaxies with higher star formation rates (SFRs) exhibit steeper negative gradients, while sSFR shows a strong anti-correlation with gradient slope. Because EoR galaxies in FIRE-2 generally lack significant rotational support, we adopt the ratio of peak-to-peak velocity shear to twice the velocity dispersion ($\\Delta v/2\\sigma$) as a proxy for the strength of gas flows. We find a strong positive correlation between metallicity gradients and $\\Delta v/2\\sigma$: galaxies with lower $\\Delta v/2\\sigma$ (i.e., weaker gas flows) tend to exhibit steeper negative gradients. Furthermore, galaxies with steeper gradients display higher central SFR surface densities, suggesting localized star formation with inefficient interstellar medium mixing that drives inside-out chemical enrichment in galaxy evolution in the early Universe.",

Submitted to AAS journals Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) During cosmic noon ($z\\sim1-3$), when both star formation and black hole growth peaked, galaxy mergers are predicted to trigger dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) that eventually coalesce as supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. However, observations of dual quasars with sub-5 kpc separations-the critical phase preceding final coalescence-have remained elusive due to angular resolution limitations. We present the discovery and confirmation of two sub-arcsecond dual quasars at $z>1$, selected from 59,025 SDSS quasars, which fall within the footprint of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey. Using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging and slitless spectroscopy, we confirmed SDSS J1625+4309 ($z=1.647$, separation 0.55\"/4.7 kpc) and SDSS J0229$-$0514 ($z=3.174$, separation 0.42\"/3.2 kpc), probing the sub-5 kpc separation regime. Through novel combination of WFC3/IR direct imaging (F140W) and grism spectroscopy (G141), we resolve both components morphologically and spectroscopically confirm their dual nature via detection of H$\\beta$+[OIII] and MgII emission lines in each nucleus. Two-dimensional image decomposition reveals distinct host galaxy morphologies: J1625+4309 shows an extended, disturbed structure ($R_e$=4.7 kpc) indicative of an ongoing major merger, while J0229$-$0514 exhibits a compact host ($R_e$=1.4 kpc) suggesting an advanced coalescence stage. Black hole mass estimates based on virial relations yield M$_{\\mathrm{BH}} \\sim 10^{8.1}-10^{8.7} M_\\odot$ with line-of-sight velocity offsets of $(0.7\\pm0.1)\\times10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$ and $(1.0\\pm0.2)\\times10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. These confirmations directly constrain the frequency and properties of close dual quasars, opening new avenues for studying SMBH mergers at cosmic noon.",

In recent years, more next-generation low-frequency radio telescopes (e.g., LOFAR, LWA and MWA) have enriched the observational window below 350 MHz, enabling more detailed explorations of the ISM effects, such as absorption and scattering, resulting in diverse spectral behaviors observed across different pulsars. This paper reviews the morphology of pulsar radio spectra, advances in spectral modeling, and the key physical processes governing the low-frequency emission. Looking ahead, next-generation instruments such as SKA-Low - with their unprecedented sensitivity - are expected to resolve outstanding questions in pulsar emission processes, offering insights into the extreme physical regimes governing these exotic objects.",

Comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Star formation in galaxies is a complex phenomenon occurring on a very wide range of scales, and molecular clouds are at the heart of this process. The formation of these structures and the subsequent collapse of the gas within them to form new stars remain unresolved scientific questions. In particular, the role and importance of gravity at between the disk scale height and prestellar cores (100 to 0.01 pc) are still topics of debate. In this work, we conduct a case study examining the mass assembly and evolution of a giant molecular cloud complex in a numerical stratified-box simulation of the interstellar medium with photo-ionizing and supernova driving and resolving down to scales $\\gtrsim 1$ pc and densities up to $10^3$ cm$^{-3}$. By introducing tracer particles to precisely track the forces acting on the gas during its evolution towards and within the clouds, we are able to quantify how much of the mass inflow is driven by the self-gravity of the gas and the gravity from the stellar disk. We find that up to 20% of the gas is gravity-driven at a scale of 100 pc, contributing 10% of the inflow from the warm to the cold phase and 20% from the cold phase to the individual molecular clouds, reaching up to 45% inside the molecular gas, at densities $\\gtrsim 400$ cm$^{-3}$. However, at the 100 pc scale, the contribution of gravity-driven gas on the linewidth is negligible. We conclude that the bulk of the gas motions assembling the clouds in our simulation are caused by the supernova-driven supersonic turbulence, which results in locally convergent flows, with a small contribution from the stellar gravitational potential.",

The catalog will be made publicly available after the paper is accepted. Comments welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Dynamically cold stellar streams from tidally dissolved globular clusters (GCs) serve as excellent tools to measure the Galactic mass distribution and show promise to probe the nature of dark matter. For successful application of these tools to observations, it is essential to have an accurate model of stellar stream properties on the Galactic scale. To this end we produce a mock catalog of stellar streams in four simulated Milky Way-like galaxies. We build the catalog with three main components: a model for the formation and disruption of globular clusters based on cosmological simulations, time-dependent potentials constructed with basis function expansions for integrating stream orbits, and an improved particle spray algorithm for efficient generation of stellar streams. We find that the observable widths and lengths of mock streams as a function of galactocentric radius are well described by power-laws for streams beyond 10 kpc. We generate mock photometry for Gaia, LSST, and Roman, and find that the latter two surveys will increase the number of observable stars in GC stellar streams by several orders of magnitude. Our full catalog, containing stream populations across four different galaxy realizations, is publicly available and can be used to study stream population statistics and to calibrate models which use stellar streams to understand our Galaxy.",

Submitted to PASP, comments are welcome Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Precise stellar ages are fundamental to Galactic archaeology. However, obtaining reliable age estimates and uncertainties for field stars has been a long-standing challenge. We test the fidelity of ages from recent catalogs of giants and subgiants using wide binaries, whose components formed at the same time and thus should have consistent inferred ages. We find that subgiant ages based on spectroscopic metallicities from Xiang & Rix (2022) are generally consistent within their reported uncertainties, implying that fractional uncertainties of 5-10% are realistically achievable. In contrast, we find that published photometric subgiant ages and red giant ages underestimate true uncertainties by factors of 2-5. These results demonstrate that accurate metallicity and $\\alpha$-element abundances are essential for precise isochrone ages and establish wide binaries as a powerful, model-independent benchmark for calibrating stellar age measurements in the era of large spectroscopic surveys.",

Recommended for publication by the Editor in A&A on October 9, 2025. Manuscript ID: aa57087-25 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a detailed analysis of the white dwarf cooling sequence (WD CS) in omega Centauri based on combined Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and JWST observations. Our analysis confirms the previously reported split - based on HST observations in ultraviolet filters - in the upper part of the WD CS, consistent with the presence of two distinct WD populations, and extends it to a significantly fainter and cooler limit (down to ~8000 K), corresponding to cooling ages of about 1 Gyr. We used artificial star (AS) tests and cooling models to confirm that the split is evidence of two WD populations with different masses and progenitors: one sequence of canonical WDs produced by the He-normal progenitors, and one sequence of low-mass WDs originated from the cluster He-rich component. We show that the fraction of WDs from the He-rich component in the outer regions is smaller than that found in the innermost regions. We also studied the kinematics of WDs and showed that in the outer regions, the velocity distribution of WDs from He-rich progenitors is slightly radially anisotropic, while that of canonical WDs is slightly tangentially anisotropic. Both the radial variation of the fraction of WDs from the He-rich population and the difference between their velocity distribution and that of canonical WDs are consistent with spatial and kinematic differences previously found for He-rich and He-normal main-sequence (MS) stars and in general agreement with models predicting that He-rich stars form more centrally concentrated than He-normal stars.",

The hydrodynamical models use stellar evolution calculations as inner boundary conditions and updated values for the number of ionizing photons. Special emphasis is placed on the formation of neutral spikes, as recently observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. The results indicate that neutral spikes can be detected either at the formation of planetary nebulae or in their decline. In the first case, the temporal window decreases with the mass of the model, ranging from 3,000 years in the 1 Mo case to 0 for 5 Mo. In the second case, only the 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 Mo cases allow us to detect the neutral spikes for most of the remaining time.",

Duarte Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn) Instabilities driven by strong gradients appear in a wide variety of physical systems, including plasmas, neutral fluids, and self-gravitating systems. This work develops an analytic formulation to describe the transport structure and nonlinear amplitude evolution of a discrete, strongly driven instability in the presence of energy sources and sinks. Initially, the mode is found to evolve linearly until the gradient in the distribution has been exhausted. It then transitions to a nonlinear phase governed by a Bernoulli differential equation, for which a closed-form analytic solution is found, and continues to evolve until the energy sources and sinks reach equilibrium. During the nonlinear phase, the leading order distribution function is found to persistently satisfy an advection-diffusion equation in time and energy coordinates. These analytical results are shown to agree closely with nonlinear kinetic simulations and to be readily applicable in the study of resonant transport in plasmas, galaxies and viscous shear flows.",

      "abstract": "Identification of molecular line emission using Convolutional Neural Networks Nina Kessler, Timea Csengeri, David Cornu, Sylvain Bontemps, Laure Bouscasse Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Complex organic molecules (COMs) are observed to be abundant in various astrophysical environments, in particular toward star forming regions they are observed both toward protostellar envelopes as well as shocked regions. Emission spectrum especially of heavier COMs may consists of up to hundreds of lines, where line blending hinders the analysis. However, identifying the molecular composition of the gas leading to the observed millimeter spectra is the first step toward a quantitative analysis. We develop a new method based on supervised machine learning to recognize spectroscopic features of the rotational spectrum of molecules in the 3mm atmospheric transmission band for a list of species including COMs with the aim to obtain a detection probability. We used local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) modeling to build a large set of synthetic spectra of 20 molecular species including COMs with a range of physical conditions typical for star forming regions. We successfully designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that provides detection probabilities of individual species in the spectra. We demonstrate that the produced CNN-model has a robust performance to detect spectroscopic signatures from these species in synthetic spectra. We evaluate its ability to detect molecules according to the noise level, frequency coverage, and line-richness, and also test its performance for incomplete frequency coverage with high detection probabilities for the tested parameter space, and no false predictions. Ultimately, we apply the CNN-model to obtain predictions on observational data from the literature toward line-rich hot-core like sources, where detection probabilities remain reasonable with no false detection. We prove the use of CNNs facilitating the analysis of complex millimeter spectra both on synthetic spectra as well as first tests on observational data.",

However, this dependence has previously been investigated in the near-infrared across multiple bands only for -1.05 $\\leq$ [Fe/H] $\\leq$ 0.40, a range accessible through the star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Therefore, we used star clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud and the Milky Way Galaxy to investigate the age and metallicity dependence of the absolute magnitude and colour of RC stars in the near-infrared for a broader parameter space (0.45 $\\leq$ Age (Gyr) $\\leq$ 10.5, -1.65 $\\leq$ [Fe/H] $\\leq$ 0.32). Comparison of our results with three isochronous models BaSTI, PARSEC, and MIST reveals that the age dependence of the absolute magnitude for young RC stars aligns well with theoretical predictions, within the fitting errors of the multiple regression analysis. Additionally, the observed colour shows good agreement with the theoretical models. Notably, the $J - K_{S}$ colour, which spans a wide parameter space, reproduces the distribution expected from the theoretical model.",

In this work, we investigate the physical origin of the asymmetric response observed in broad absorption line (BAL) systems and constrain the gas density and spatial scale of quasar outflows. Using time-dependent photoionization simulations and analytical estimates focused on CIV, we quantify the response timescales across different ionization states. Our results show that over 70\\% of BAL gas exhibits a negative response to quasar dimming, indicating a strong asymmetry in ionization behavior. This asymmetry is driven by systematically shorter response timescales in higher ionization states. Given typical observational cadences longer than one day, the observed response pattern requires at least 40% of the BAL gas to have a density below $n_{\\rm H} = 10^6\\ \\cc$, consistent with most measured BAL densities but significantly lower than typical accretion disk winds ($n_{\\rm H} > 10^8\\ \\cc$). These findings suggest that BAL outflows either undergo substantial density evolution as they propagate or originate from larger-scale regions such as the dusty torus. The asymmetric response thus provides new constraints on the physical structure and origin of quasar outflows.",

We present a deep generative model for gravitational waveforms from binary neutron star mergers that captures the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown phases while incorporating spin precession and tidal effects. Using a conditional autoencoder architecture, the model efficiently produces high-fidelity waveforms across a broad parameter space, including component masses (m1, m2), spin components (S1x, S1y, S1z, S2x, S2y, S2z), and tidal deformabilities (Lambda1, Lambda2). Trained on 1*10^6 waveforms generated by the IMRPhenomXP_NRTidalv2 model, our network achieves a mean mismatch of 2.13*10^-3. The generation time for a single waveform is 0.12 s, compared to 0.66 s for IMRPhenomXP_NRTidalv2, representing a speedup of about fivefold. When generating 1000 waveforms, the model completes the task in 0.75 s, roughly ten times faster than the baseline. This significant acceleration facilitates rapid parameter estimation and real-time gravitational-wave searches. With improved precision and efficiency, the model can support low-latency detection and broader applications in multi-messenger astrophysics.",

XRISM measurements of ICM velocities in several clusters offer insights into these processes. We compare XRISM measurements for nine galaxy clusters (Virgo, Perseus, Centaurus, Hydra A, PKS\\,0745--19, A2029, Coma, A2319, Ophiuchus) with predictions from three state-of-the-art cosmological simulation suites, TNG-Cluster, The Three Hundred Project GADGET-X, and GIZMO-SIMBA, that employ different models of feedback. In cool cores, XRISM reveals systematically lower velocity dispersions than the simulations predict, with all ten measurements below the median simulated values by a factor $1.5-1.7$ on average and all falling within the bottom $10\\%$ of the predicted distributions. The observed kinetic-to-total pressure ratio is also lower, with a median value of $2.2\\%$, compared to the predicted $5.0-6.5\\%$ for the three simulations. Outside the cool cores and in non-cool-core clusters, simulations show better agreement with XRISM measurements, except for the outskirts of the relaxed, cool-core cluster A2029, which exhibits an exceptionally low kinetic pressure support ($<1\\%$), with none of the simulated systems in either of the three suites reaching such low levels. The non-cool-core Coma and A2319 exhibit dispersions at the lower end but within the simulated spread. Our comparison suggests that the three numerical models may overestimate the kinetic effects of SMBH feedback in cluster cores. Additional XRISM observations of non-cool-core clusters will clarify if there is a systematic tension in the gravity-dominated regime as well.",

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present JWST observations of the environments surrounding two high-redshift quasars -- J0252$-$0503 at $z = 7.0$ and J1007$+$2115 at $z = 7.5$ -- which enable the first constraints on quasar-galaxy clustering at $z \\sim 7.3$. Galaxies in the vicinity of the quasars are selected through ground-based and JWST/NIRCam imaging and then spectroscopically confirmed with JWST/NIRSpec using the multi-shutter assembly (MSA). Over both fields, we identify 51 $z>5$ galaxies, of which eight are found within a $\\Delta v_{\\textrm{LOS}}=\\pm1500 \\rm{km} \\rm{s}^{-1}$ line-of-sight velocity window from the quasars and another eight in the background. The galaxy J0252\\_8713, located just $7\\,\\rm{pkpc}$ and $\\Delta v_{\\textrm{LOS}} \\approx 360\\,\\rm{km}\\,\\rm{s}^{-1}$ from quasar J0252$-$0503, emerges as a compelling candidate for one of the most distant quasar-galaxy mergers. Combining the galaxy discoveries over the two fields, we measure the quasar-galaxy cross-correlation and obtain a correlation length of $r_0^{\\rm{QG}}\\approx7.6_{-1.6}^{+1.7}\\,h^{-1}\\,\\rm{cMpc}$, based on a power-law model with a fixed slope of $\\gamma_{\\rm{QG}} = 2.0$. Under the assumption that quasars and galaxies trace the same underlying dark matter density fluctuations, we infer a minimum dark matter halo mass for $z\\simeq7.3$ quasars of $\\log_{10}(M_{\\textrm{halo, min}}/\\textrm{M}_{\\odot})= 11.6\\pm0.6$ in a halo model framework. Compared to measurements from EIGER at $\\langle z \\rangle = 6.25$ and ASPIRE at $\\langle z \\rangle = 6.7$ (where $\\log_{10}(M_{\\textrm{halo, min}}/\\textrm{M}_{\\odot}) \\gtrsim 12.3$), our clustering results provide tentative evidence for a non-monotonic redshift evolution of quasar clustering properties. We further estimate a quasar duty cycle of $f_{\\rm{duty}}\\approx0.1\\%$, consistent with constraints from quasar proximity zones and IGM damping wings. (abridged)",

The recent discovery of 3I/ATLAS, a new interstellar comet, offers a unique opportunity to investigate the physical and chemical properties of interstellar objects and to compare them with those of comets in our own Solar System. In this Letter we present the results of a 10-night spectroscopic and photometric monitoring campaign with the 2.4 m Hiltner and 1.3 m McGraw-Hill telescopes at the MDM Observatory. The campaign was conducted between August 8 and 17 while 3I/ATLAS was inbound at heliocentric distances of 3.2 - 2.9 au. Our observations captured the onset of optical gas activity. Nightly spectra reveal a weak CN emission feature in the coma of 3I/ATLAS, absent during the first nights but steadily strengthening thereafter. We measure a CN production rate of $Q$(CN)$\\sim6\\times$10$^{24}$ s$^{-1}$, towards the lower end of activity observed in Solar System comets. Simultaneous photometry also indicates a small but measurable increase in the coma's radial profile and increasing $r$-band $Af\\rho$ with values in the order of $\\sim300$ cm. We derived a gas-to-dust production ratio of $\\log Q (\\mathrm{CN})/Af\\rho\\sim22.4$. Our upper limit on the C$_2$-to-CN ratio ($\\log Q(\\mathrm{C}_2)/Q(\\mathrm{CN})\\lesssim-0.8$) indicates that 3I/ATLAS is a strongly carbon-chain depleted comet. Further observations of 3I/ATLAS are required to verify the apparent carbon-chain depletion and to explore whether such composition represents a recurring trait of the interstellar comet population.",

Hillenbrand, Shreya Chandragiri, Marvin Morgan 35 pages plus 46 pages of light curve plots, 12 figures; accepted to the Astrophysical Journal Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We have carried out a photometric time domain study of 188 intermediate-mass young stars observed in Full Frame Image mode with the TESS satellite over the first 3.3 years of its mission. The majority of these targets are classified as Herbig Ae/Be stars (HAeBes). All were monitored at optical wavelengths for at least one 27-day TESS sector, with many having multiple sectors of data. From a custom aperture photometry pipeline, we produced light curves and analyzed the variability therein, as a function of stellar and circumstellar properties. Based on visual and statistical analysis, we find that ~95% of HAeBes are variable on timescales of 10 minutes to 1 month, with the most common light curve morphology being stochastic. Approximately 15% of the set display quasi-periodic variability. In comparison to sets of low-mass T Tauri stars monitored with optical space telescopes, the Herbig Ae/Be stars display a much lower incidence of ``dipper\" behaviors (quasi-periodic or aperiodic fading events), as well as periodic modulations. As posited by previous work, we conclude that magnetic starspots are rare on HAeBes, and that the inner circumstellar dust rims of these objects lie at substantially larger radii than for low-mass young stars. Beyond these differences, the accretion dynamics of young stars less than ~7$M_\\odot$ appear to be largely consistent based on their time domain properties from data streams of up to three months' duration. We do, however, find tentative evidence for a change in variability amplitude above this mass boundary, particularly for quasi-periodic behavior.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ on September 22, 2025 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We report the detection of 13 heavy elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Sr) in the photosphere of LSPM J0207+3331, a ~3 Gyr old hydrogen-rich white dwarf with an effective temperature comparable to that of the Sun. Upper limits on carbon, obtained through the absence of molecular CH, suggest accretion from a carbon-volatile-depleted source. The accreted parent body exhibits slight deficits of Mg and Si relative to Fe but otherwise bulk Earth-like abundance patterns; a reasonable interpretation is that LSPM J0207+3331 is accreting a massive differentiated rocky body that had a core mass fraction higher than the Earth's. The high level of pollution indicates that substantial accretion events can still occur even after 3 Gyr of cooling. We also detect weak Ca II H & K line-core emission, making this only the second known isolated polluted white dwarf to exhibit this phenomenon and suggesting the presence of additional physical processes in or above the upper atmosphere. Our analysis also highlights the critical importance of including heavy elements in the model atmosphere structure calculations for highly polluted hydrogen-rich white dwarfs. Neglecting their contribution significantly impacts the inferred thermodynamic structure, leading to inaccuracies in derived stellar parameters. Finally, we show that the observed 11.3 microns infrared excess can be explained by a single silicate dust disk rather than a two-ring disk model.",

Fortney, Aishwarya Iyer, Sagnick Mukherjee, Caroline V. Morley, Mark S. Marley, Michael Line, Philip S. Muirhead Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We extend the Sonora Diamondback brown dwarf evolution models to higher effective temperatures to treat the evolution of younger, higher mass objects. Due to an upper temperature limit of $T_\\mathrm{eff}=$2400 K in the original Sonora Diamondback model grid, high mass objects ($M\\geq$ 0.05 $M_\\mathrm{\\odot}=$ 52.4 $M_\\mathrm{J}$) were limited to ages of $\\gtrsim$ 100 Myr. To include the early evolution of brown dwarfs at $T_\\mathrm{eff}>$ 2400 K, we use existing and new SPHINX cloud-free model atmosphere calculations of temperature structures of M-type atmospheres. These atmospheres range from $T_\\mathrm{eff}$ 2000--4000 K, log($g$) 3.0--5.5, and metallicity [M/H] $-$0.5 to $+$0.5. This combination of Diamondback and SPHINX atmospheres, with a transition across $T_\\mathrm{eff}$ 2000--2400 K, allows us to calculate evolution tracks, and infrared photometry and colors, for ages $>$ 1 Myr and masses from above the hydrogen burning minimum mass down to planetary masses. The Hayashi phase of massive brown dwarf evolution (ages $<$ 10--100 Myr) at low surface gravity leads to nearly constant $T_\\mathrm{eff}$ values, at effective temperatures much lower than would be obtained from simply extrapolating backwards from evolution tracks at older ages.",

Using the Mount Wilson magnetic classification (MWMC), we categorize all active regions (ARs) between 1999 and 2020 into three groups: alpha, beta, and complex ARs. Subsequently, we classify the near-Earth AR solar wind into the corresponding three types based on the magnetic type of ARs. Our results show that alpha, beta, and complex ARs account for 19.99%, 66.67%, and 13.34% of all ARs, respectively, while their corresponding AR solar wind proportions are 16.96%, 45.18%, and 37.86%. The properties of solar wind from different types of ARs vary significantly. As the magnetic complexity of ARs increases, the corresponding AR solar wind exhibits higher magnetic field strength, charge states, helium abundance (A_He), and first ionization potential (FIP) bias. Our results demonstrate that complex ARs are more effective at generating solar wind. Additionally, the strong magnetic fields and frequent magnetic activities in complex ARs can heat the plasma to higher temperatures and effectively transport helium-rich materials from the lower atmosphere to the upper corona.",

Gilman 8 pages, 5 figures, accepted in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The activity of Sun-like stars is governed by the magnetic field, which is believed to be generated in a thin layer between convective and radiative envelopes. The dynamo layer, also called the tachocline, permits the existence of Rossby waves (r-modes) described by magnetohydrodynamic shallow water models, which may lead to short-term cycles in stellar activity. Convective cells penetrate into the layer creating an overshoot upper part, where they transport an additional energy for vigorous activity. The aim of this paper is to study the influence of overshooting convection on the dynamics of Rossby waves in the tachoclines of Sun-like stars. Here we write the magnetohydrodynamic shallow water equations with the effect of the penetrative convection and study the dynamics of wave modes in the layer. The formalism leads to the excitation of new oscillation modes connected with the dynamo coefficient, alpha, causing periodic modulations of all parameters in the tachocline. The modes are coupled with the Rossby waves resulting mutual exchange of convective and rotation energies. The timescales of Rossby-dynamo waves, for certain parameters, correspond to Schwabe (11 years) and Rieger (150-170 days) cycles as observed in solar activity. The waves provide a new paradigm for internal magnetism and may drive the dynamos of Sun-like stars. Theoretical properties of the waves and observations can be used for magneto-seismological sounding of stellar interiors.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Context. Determining the orbital periods of cataclysmic variable stars (CVs) is essential for confirming candidates and for the understanding of their evolutionary state. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides month-long photometric data across nearly the entire sky that can be used to search for periodic variability in such systems. Aims. This study aims to identify and confirm the orbital periods for members of a recent compilation of magnetic CVs (known as polars) using TESS light curves. In addition, we set out to investigate their reliability, and hence the relevance of TESS for variability studies of CVs. Results. Ninety-five of the 217 polars in our sample have pipeline-produced TESS two-minute cadence light curves available. The results from our period search are overall in good agreement with the previously reported values. Out of the 95 analysed systems, 85 exhibit periods consistent with the literature values. Among the remaining ten objects, four are asynchronous polars, where TESS light curves resolve the orbital period, the white dwarf's spin period, and additional beat frequencies. For four systems, the periods detected from the TESS data differ from those previously reported. For two systems, a period detection was not possible. Our analysis of the flattened TESS light curves reveals a positive correlation between noise levels and TESS magnitude. Our noise level estimates resemble the rmsCDPP, a measure of white noise provided with the TESS pipeline products. However, our values for the noise level are systematically higher than the rmsCDPP indicating red noise and high-frequency signals hidden in the flattened light curves. Additionally, we present a statistical methodology to assess the reliability of period detections in TESS light curves. We find that for TESS magnitudes $\\gtrsim$ 17, period detections become increasingly unreliable.",

Stritzinger, L. Strolger, T. Temim, S. Tinyanont, M. Tucker, L. Wang, Q. Wang, Y. Yang Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec 1.7--5.5 micron observations of SN~2024ggi at +285.51 and +385.27 days post-explosion. The late-time nebular spectra are dominated by emission lines from various ionization states of H, Ca, Ar, C, Mg, Ni, Co, and Fe. We also detect strong CO emission in both the first overtone and fundamental vibrational bands. Most atomic features exhibit asymmetric line profiles, indicating an aspherical explosion. Using observed fluxes combined with non-LTE radiative-transfer simulations, we develop a data-driven method that resolves the complex molecular-emission region, constrains its 3D structure, and reproduces high-fidelity spectral profiles. We find that, CO is mostly formed prior to +285d past explosion. The subsequent evolution is dominated by the evaporation of CO with CO mass varying from M(CO) of 8.7E-3 to 1.3E-3 Mo, and with instabilities growing from almost homogeneous to highly clumped (density contrast f_c of 1.2 to 2). The minimum velocity of CO only slightly decreases between epochs (v_1 of 1200 and 1100 km/sec), with the reference temperature dropping from T_1 of 2400 and 1900K.",

Accepted for publication in RASTI Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) In the era of exploding survey volumes, traditional methods of spectroscopic analysis are being pushed to their limits. In response, we develop deep-REMAP, a novel deep learning framework that utilizes a regularized, multi-task approach to predict stellar atmospheric parameters from observed spectra. We train a deep convolutional neural network on the PHOENIX synthetic spectral library and use transfer learning to fine-tune the model on a small subset of observed FGK dwarf spectra from the MARVELS survey. We then apply the model to 732 uncharacterized FGK giant candidates from the same survey. When validated on 30 MARVELS calibration stars, deep-REMAP accurately recovers the effective temperature ($T_{\\rm{eff}}$), surface gravity ($\\log \\rm{g}$), and metallicity ([Fe/H]), achieving a precision of, for instance, approximately 75 K in $T_{\\rm{eff}}$. By combining an asymmetric loss function with an embedding loss, our regression-as-classification framework is interpretable, robust to parameter imbalances, and capable of capturing non-Gaussian uncertainties. While developed for MARVELS, the deep-REMAP framework is extensible to other surveys and synthetic libraries, demonstrating a powerful and automated pathway for stellar characterization.",

Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Astrometry from the Gaia mission has revealed a large population of white dwarf (WD) + main sequence (MS) binaries with periods of $100 - 1000\\,$d. These systems have separations intermediate to predictions from standard binary evolution scenarios, challenging models of binary interaction and mass transfer. Because the selection function of Gaia astrometric catalogs is complex, the underlying population demographics of WD+MS binaries remain imperfectly understood. We present a forward-model of the AU-scale WD+MS binary population probed by Gaia that begins with a realistic binary population and incorporates a full model of Gaia mock observations and astrometric model fitting, as well as cuts employed in producing the Gaia astrometric catalog and selecting WD+MS binary candidates. We model the formation of AU-scale WD+MS binaries as the result of interaction when the WD progenitor is an AGB star. We test several models for the binaries' formation, including stable mass transfer with theoretically predicted stability criteria and two different formalisms for common envelope evolution. None of these models succeed in reproducing the observed component mass distributions or the absolute number of WD+MS binaries. The data are best reproduced by a model in which post-AGB binaries remain wide only if the accretor-to-donor mass ratio exceeds $\\sim 0.4$. Our model allows us to constrain the intrinsic population demographics of intermediate-separation WD+MS binaries. The inferred period distribution is close to flat, with ${\\rm d}N/{\\rm d}P_{\\rm orb}\\propto P_{\\rm orb}^{0.12}$, while the WD mass distribution is sharply peaked at $0.6\\,M_{\\odot}$. The model implies that $\\sim 0.4\\%$ of solar-type stars have WD companions with periods of $100 - 1000\\,$d.",

In this context, we implement and investigate the robustness of the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method in solving the equation modeling stellar oscillations for realistic solar backgrounds containing gravity and differential rotation. While a common choice for modeling stellar oscillations is the Galbrun's equation, our working equations are derived from an equivalent variant, involving less regularity in its coefficients, working with Lagrangian displacement and pressure perturbation as unknowns. Under differential rotation and axisymmetric assumption, the system is solved in azimuthal decomposition with the HDG method. Compared to no-gravity approximations, the mathematical nature of the wave operator is now linked to the profile of the solar buoyancy frequency N which encodes gravity, and leads to distinction into regions of elliptic or hyperbolic behavior of the wave operator at zero attenuation. While small attenuation is systematically included to guarantee theoretical well-posedness, the above phenomenon affects the numerical solutions in terms of amplitude and oscillation pattern, and requires a judicious choice of stabilization. We investigate the stabilization of the HDG discretization scheme, and demonstrate its importance to ensure the accuracy of numerical results, which is shown to depend on frequencies relative to N, and on the position of the Dirac source. As validations, the numerical power spectra reproduce accurately the observed effects of the solar rotation on acoustic waves.",

Recently, the emergence of deep-learning models trained across very large datasets has created a new paradigm for machine learning in the form of Foundation Models. Foundation Models are programs trained on very large and broad datasets with an extensive number of parameters. Once built, these powerful, and flexible, models can be utilized in less resource-intensive ways to build many different, downstream applications that can integrate previously disparate, multimodal data. The development of these applications can be done rapidly and with a much lower demand for machine learning expertise. And the necessary infrastructure and models themselves are already being established within agencies such as NASA and ESA. At NASA this work is across several divisions of the Science Mission Directorate including the NASA Goddard and INDUS Large Language Models and the Prithvi Geospatial Foundation Model. And ESA initiatives to bring Foundation Models to Earth observations has led to the development of TerraMind. A workshop was held by the NASA Ames Research Center and the SETI Institute, in February 2025, to investigate the potential of Foundation Models for astrobiological research and to determine what steps would be needed to build and utilize such a model or models. This paper shares the findings and recommendations of that workshop, and describes clear near-term, and future opportunities in the development of a Foundation Model (or Models) for astrobiology applications. These applications would include a biosignature, or life characterization, task, a mission development and operations task, and a natural language task for integrating and supporting astrobiology research needs.",

In the current era of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger astronomy, international organisations are actively working on the definition of new standards for the publication of astronomical data, and substantial effort is devoted to make them available through public archives. Aims. We present a set of tools that allow user-friendly access and basic scientific analysis of observations in Hierarchical Progressive Survey (HiPS) format, and we use them to gauge the quality of representative skymaps at ultraviolet, optical, and infrared wavelengths. Methods. We apply a fully-automatic procedure to derive aperture photometry in 10 different bands for the 323 nearby galaxies in the Herschel Reference Sample (HRS), and compare its results with the rigorous analyses involving specialised knowledge and human intervention carried out by the HRS team. Results. Our experiment shows that 9 of the 10 skymaps considered preserve the original quality of the data, and the photometric fluxes returned by our pipeline are consistent with the HRS measurements within a few per cent. In the case of Herschel PACS maps at 100 {\\mu}m, we uncovered a systematic error that we ascribe to an inconsistent combination of data products with different spatial resolution. For the remaining skymaps, the estimated statistical uncertainties provide a realistic indication of the differences with respect to the HRS catalogue. Conclusions. In principle, the currently available HiPS skymaps in Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) format allow to carry out broadband photometric analyses with an accuracy of the order of a few percent, but some level human intervention is still required. In addition to assessing data quality, we also propose a series of recommendations to realise the full potential of the HiPS format for the scientific analysis of large astronomical data sets.",

Missions like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have made information about distant objects more easily accessible, resulting in extensive amounts of valuable data. As part of this work-in-progress study, we are working to create an atmospheric absorption spectrum prediction model for exoplanets. The eventual model will be based on both collected observational spectra and synthetic spectral data generated by the ROCKE-3D general circulation model (GCM) developed by the climate modeling program at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS). In this initial study, spline curves are used to describe the bin heights of simulated atmospheric absorption spectra as a function of one of the values of the planetary parameters. Bayesian Adaptive Exploration is then employed to identify areas of the planetary parameter space for which more data are needed to improve the model. The resulting system will be used as a forward model so that planetary parameters can be inferred given a planet's atmospheric absorption spectrum. This work is expected to contribute to a better understanding of exoplanetary properties and general exoplanet climates and habitability.",

Enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio directly on detectors is difficult and expensive, leading to extensive research in advanced post-processing techniques. Aims: Removing background noise from images is a valuable pre-processing step catalog-building tasks. We introduce BGRem, a machine learning (ML) based tool to remove background noise from astronomical images. Methods: BGRem uses a diffusion-based model with an attention U-Net as backbone, trained on simulated images for optical and gamma ({\\gamma})-ray data from the MeerLICHT and Fermi-LAT telescopes. In a supervised manner, BGRem learns to denoise astronomical images over several diffusion steps. Results: BGRem performance was compared with a widely used tool for cataloging astronomical sources, SourceExtractor (SExtractor). It was shown that the amount of true positive sources using SExtractor increased by about 7% for MeerLICHT data when BGRem was used as a pre-processing step. We also show the generalizability of BGRem by testing it with optical images from different telescopes and also on simulated {\\gamma}-ray data representative of the Fermi-LAT telescope. We show that in both cases, BGRem improves the source detection efficiency. Conclusions: BGRem can improve the accuracy in source detection of traditional pixel-based methods by removing complex background noise. Using zero-shot approach, BGRem can generalize well to a wide range of optical images. The successful application of BGRem to simulated {\\gamma}-ray images, alongside optical data, demonstrates its adaptability to distinct noise characteristics and observational domains. This cross-wavelength performance highlights its potential as a general-purpose background removal framework for multi-wavelength astronomical surveys.",

Our analysis isolates and quantifies the impact of recent physical advances motivated by detailed modeling of Jupiter and Saturn, including updated hydrogen-helium and heavy-element equations of state, helium rain, \"fuzzy\" cores, and non-adiabatic, inhomogeneous envelopes, alongside improved atmospheric boundary conditions that incorporate ammonia cloud physics. We first examine the influence of each new physical ingredient individually, then construct combined baseline models for masses between 0.3 to 4 Jupiter masses to assess their collective effect on planetary structure and observable properties. We find that the adoption of modern equations of state and realistic heavy-element distributions leads to systematic, but sometimes subtle, differences (~5 to 10%) in radius evolution, while helium rain and the treatment of convection can significantly alter thermal histories and atmospheric compositions (by ~5 to 20%). These updated physical processes must be incorporated into the next-generation exoplanet evolutionary models to achieve physically consistent interpretations of planetary observations.",

Sturm 21 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Direct observations of exoplanet and brown dwarf companions with near-infrared interferometry, first enabled by the dual-field mode of VLTI/GRAVITY, provide unique measurements of the objects' orbital motion and atmospheric composition. Here, we compile a homogeneous library of all exoplanet and brown dwarf K-band spectra observed by GRAVITY thus far. We re-reduce all available GRAVITY dual-field high-contrast data and, where companions are detected, extract their ~2.0-2.4 $\\mu$m K-band contrast spectra. We then derive stellar model atmospheres for all employed flux references that we use to convert the companion contrast into companion flux spectra. Solely from the resulting GRAVITY spectra, we extract spectral types, spectral indices, and bulk physical properties for all companions. Finally, and with the help of age constraints from the literature, we also derive isochronal masses for most companions using evolutionary models. The resulting library contains R ~ 500 GRAVITY spectra of 39 substellar companions from late M to late T spectral type, including the entire L-T transition. Throughout this transition, a shift from CO-dominated late M- and L-type dwarfs to CH4-dominated T-type dwarfs can be observed in the K-band. The GRAVITY spectra alone constrain the objects' bolometric luminosity to typically within $\\pm$0.15 dex. The derived isochronal masses agree with dynamical masses from the literature where available, except for HD 4113 c for which we confirm its previously reported potential underluminosity. Medium resolution spectroscopy of substellar companions with GRAVITY provides insight into the carbon chemistry and the cloudiness of these objects' atmospheres. It also constrains these objects' bolometric luminosity which can yield measurements of their formation entropy if combined with dynamical masses, for instance from Gaia and GRAVITY astrometry.",

Sefilian 7 pages, 5 figures, revised in response to MNRAS Letter reviewer comments Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The nearby binary star system 99 Herculis (99 Her) is host to the only known polar-aligned circumbinary debris disc. We investigate the hypothesis that the narrow structure of this circumbinary disc is sculpted by the gravitational influence of one or more unseen polar circumbinary planets. We first establish the theoretically viable parameter space for a sculpting planet by considering dynamical stability and clearing mechanisms, including the chaotic zone, Hill radius, diffusion, and polar alignment timescales. We then use $N$-body simulations to test three specific architectures: a single planet interior to the disc, a single planet exterior, and a two-planet system bracketing the disc. Our simulations demonstrate that single-planet models are insufficient to reproduce the observed morphology, as they can only truncate one edge of the disc while leaving the other dynamically extended. In contrast, the two-planet shepherding model successfully carves both the inner and outer edges, confining the debris into a narrow, stable polar ring consistent with observations. We conclude that the structure of the 99 Her debris disc is most plausibly explained by the presence of two shepherding, polar circumbinary planets. We present a specific, testable model for this unique system, which elucidates the pivotal role of planetary bodies in sculpting the architecture of debris discs.",

This field is now moving from the gas giant planets towards the smaller and colder telluric planets, and future instruments like ANDES will focus on the observations of the atmosphere of telluric planets in the habitable zone in reflected light. These future observations will possibly find variable signals due to the view of different hemispheres of the planet. Particularly, the strength of the signal may be linked to the thickness of the atmospheric layer probed, and therefore to the average altitude variations of the planetary surface, that are related to the global geodynamic evolution of the planet. To better prepare for the interpretation and exploitation of these future data, we used Mars as a Solar System analog of a spatially resolved telluric exoplanet. We observed the reflected light of Mars with the high-resolution near-infrared (NIR) spectrograph GIANO-B (widely used in exoplanetary atmospheric studies) during a 3 month period: we studied the spatial and temporal variations of the Martian CO2 signal using the least-squared deconvolution technique (LSD), to mimic as closely as possible the standard exoplanetary atmospheric analysis. We linked the variations found to the well-known Martian geological surface characteristics: we found a clear dependence of the strength of the CO2 signal with the thickness of the Martian atmospheric layer by comparing the retrieved CO2 signal with the altitudes of our pointings. The proposed strategy is promising: it proved to be effective on Mars and may shed light on the variations in the strength of atmospheric signal of telluric exoplanets.",

Instead, they transition into normal-thickness, magmatic Penrose-type oceanic crust, and thus diverge from the classic magma-rich and magma-poor end-member models. However, several intermediate margins, such as the South China Sea (SCS), display detachment faulting similar to magma-poor margins and magmatic underplating typical of magma-rich ones. How tectonics and magmatism interact in these intermediate environments is poorly understood. Here we use 2D numerical models to demonstrate that the elevated initial geotherm inherited from prior plate subduction in the SCS explains several key observations: an early phase of wide rifting, subsequent localization onto core complexes with substantial footwall magmatic intrusions, and eventual formation of normal igneous oceanic crust at break-up. Thermal weakening caused by syn-rift footwall magmatic intrusions facilitates lower crustal ductile flow, promoting the development of rolling-hinge type detachment faults and exhumation of core complexes. These structures are associated with accelerated tectonic subsidence, which is later moderated by detachment-related doming, as observed in the SCS. Normal-thickness oceanic crust occurs after break-up, even under ultra-slow extension rates used in our simulations, highlighting the importance of inheritance in determining margin architecture, the spatio-temporal distribution of syn-rift magmatism, and the nature of the COT. This behavior contrasts sharply with magma-poor margins, where a cooler lithosphere and similar ultra-slow extension produce no syn-rift magmatism, leading instead to crustal embrittlement, mantle serpentinization and exhumation at the COT.",

Bower, Maggie A. Thompson, Kaustubh Hakim, Meng Tian, Paolo A. Sossi 43 pages, 10 figures in main text, 8 figures in appendices, submitted to ApJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) A quantitative understanding of the nature and composition of low-mass rocky exo(planet) atmospheres during their evolution is needed to interpret observations. The magma ocean stage of terrestrial- and sub-Neptune planets permits mass exchange between their interiors and atmospheres, during which the mass and speciation of the atmosphere is dictated by the planet's volatile budget, chemical equilibria, and gas/fluid solubility in molten rock. As the atmosphere cools, it is modified by gas-phase reactions and condensation. We combine these processes into an open-source Python package built using JAX called Atmodeller, and perform calculations for planet sizes and conditions analogous to TRAPPIST-1e and K2-18b. For TRAPPIST-1e-like planets, our simulations indicate that CO-dominated atmospheres are prevalent during the magma ocean stage, which, upon isochemical cooling, predominantly evolve into CO2-rich atmospheres of a few hundred bar at 280 K. Around 40% of our simulations predict the coexistence of liquid water, graphite, sulfur, and ammonium chloride-key ingredients for surface habitability. For sub-Neptune gas dwarfs, pressures are sufficiently high (few GPa) that gas fugacities deviate from ideality, thereby drastically enhancing solubilities. This buffers the total atmospheric pressure to lower values than for the ideal case. These effects conspire to produce CH4-rich sub-Neptune atmospheres for total pressures exceeding around 3.5 GPa, provided H/C is approximately 100x solar and fO2 moderately reducing (3 log10 units below the iron-wustite buffer). Otherwise, molecular hydrogen remains the predominant species at lower total pressures and/or higher H/C. For all planets at high temperature, solubility enriches C/H in the atmosphere relative to the initial composition.",

Winn (Princeton University), Guðmundur Stefánsson (University of Amsterdam) 13 pages, submitted to AAS Journals, corrected WASP-4b companion properties Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The fate of hot Jupiters is thought to be engulfment by their host stars, the outcome of tidal orbital decay. Transit timing has revealed a few systems with apparently shrinking orbital periods, but such signals can be mimicked by light travel-time effects (LTTE) of a distant companion. Combining transit timings with precise radial-velocity data, including new data, we reassessed three reported cases of orbital decay: WASP-4, WASP-12, and Kepler-1658. For WASP-4, the period change is best explained by LTTE due to an ~8-Jupiter-mass companion at ~8 AU, with no need to invoke orbital decay. For WASP-12, in contrast, the data firmly exclude LTTE and confirm genuine orbital decay. For Kepler-1658, spectroscopic and photometric anomalies reveal the \"planet\" to be an eclipsing K/M binary bound to the F-type primary, with LTTE explaining the observed period change. Thus, among the known hot Jupiters, only WASP-12 b currently shows compelling evidence for orbital decay.",

Rev. E 112 (2025), 045203 Space Physics (physics.space-ph); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph) During the 23 April 2023 geospace storm, we observed chorus wave-driven, energetic particle precipitation on closed magnetic field lines in the dayside magnetosphere. Simultaneously and in the ionosphere's bottom-side, we observed signatures of impact ionization and strong enhancements in the ionospheric electric field, via radar-detection of meter-scale turbulence, and with matching temporal characteristics as that of the magnetospheric observations. We detailed this in a companion paper. In the present article, we place those observations into context with the dayside ionosphere, and describe a remarkably similar event that took place during the May 2024 geospace superstorm. In both cases, fast, eastward-moving electric field structures were excited equatorward of the ionospheric cusp, on closed magnetic field-lines -- observations that challenge existing modes of explanation for electrodynamics in the cusp-region, where most such observations are interpreted in the context of poleward-moving auroral forms. Instead, primarily eastward-moving electric field structures were associated with turbulent Hall currents that are perhaps characteristically excited during geospace storms by wave-particle interactions near magnetospheric equator or by proton precipitation characteristics in the cusp, forming a `parallel-plate capacitor-like effect'. We propose that transient eastward electrodynamic bursts in the dayside ionosphere might be a common, albeit previously unresolved, feature of geomagnetic storms.",

Rev. Lett. 134 (2025), 145201 Space Physics (physics.space-ph); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) Plasma waves in the magnetosphere scatter electrons, causing them to precipitate into Earth's atmosphere, imparting their temporal characteristics to diffuse auroras. In a case study of conjugate radar and satellite observations, we demonstrate a close and unprecedented association between enhanced electrostatic cyclotron harmonic wave activity in the magnetosphere and the appearance of meter-scale plasma turbulence a few seconds later in the lower ionosphere on nearby magnetic field lines. Such direct structuring of the ionosphere carries implications for our understanding of space weather.",
