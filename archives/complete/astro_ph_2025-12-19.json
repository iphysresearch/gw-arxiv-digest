Boiza, Pisin Chen 34 pages, 7 figures and 7 tables Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) 3-forms are natural candidates for describing the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe, as they can inherently reproduce a positive cosmological constant when lacking an evolving potential. When such a potential is present, a 3-form field may exhibit either quintessence-like or phantom-like behaviour. In this paper, we consider a 3-form model with a Gaussian potential, which features stable, ghost-free phantom-like behaviour within its convergence region and leads to an LSBR late-time attractor. We constrain this model observationally by performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis employing a comprehensive cosmological dataset, including Planck PR4 cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae data, low-$z$ Cepheid calibrators, and DES Y1 large-scale structure observations. We demonstrate that the 3-form model successfully increases the predicted Hubble parameter of CMB and BAO data from $67.89\\pm0.36{\\rm km/s/Mpc}$ of $\\Lambda$CDM model to $68.29^{+0.56}_{-0.61}{\\rm km/s/Mpc}$ without fine-tuning of the model parameters, thus reducing the tension with the late-time observation. Furthermore, we verify the sub-dominance of the 3-form field perturbation via both analytical and numerical analyses. Thus, the 3-form field does serve as a promising candidate of phantom-like dark energy from both theoretical and observational points of view.",

In this Letter, we show that such interpretations are fundamentally limited by the integral structure through which the equation of state enters cosmological observables. The mapping from \\omega(z) to distances involves successive integrations, which act as an intrinsic low-pass filter in redshift space. As a result, only a small number of slowly varying modes of \\omega(z) are observationally accessible, while rapid or localized temporal variations are irretrievably suppressed. This limitation is independent of any specific parametrization and represents a structural property of Friedmann--Lemaitre--Robertson--Walker cosmology with distance-based probes.",

Taylor Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In 2023, after more than two decades of searching, pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations around the world announced evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background. It was quickly followed by work from the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA), demonstrating that the results of regional collaborations were consistent with each other. The combination of these datasets is still ongoing and represents a significant investment of time and expertise. In that IPTA comparison, authors of this letter combined the separate datasets in the standard PTA optimal detection statistic for cross-correlations incoherently, that is, the data was combined without fitting a merged timing model across all PTA datasets, treating datasets of the same pulsar as independent, and neglecting the \"same pulsar, different datasets\" cross-correlations. This work refines that method by extending its core ideas beyond detection statistics and into a full, general data-combination method. We have demonstrated its efficacy and extreme efficiency on simulated data. This new method, \\textit{FrankenStat}, is very similar in sensitivity and parameter-constraining power to traditional data combination methods while completing the full data combination in just a few minutes.",

In many such theories the force is screened; suppressed in dense environments but potentially active in galaxies used for distance calibration. We model this environmental dependence using three quantities that characterize each galaxy's large-scale gravitational environment: the external gravitational potential $\\Phi$, acceleration $a$, and curvature $K$. Our baseline analysis recalibrates the SH0ES-team's Cepheid-supernova distance ladder, incorporating the fifth force via its impact on the Cepheid period-luminosity relation. Across models, a fifth force is strongly constrained, with posteriors concentrated around a null result. The inferred Hubble constant is $H_0 = 73.1 \\pm 1.0 \\, \\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, retaining the Hubble tension at $>5 \\, \\sigma$. As an additional test, we incorporate four independent Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) distance datasets into a joint Cepheid-TRGB-supernova calibration. These combined analyses further constrain the magnitude of fifth-force effects. Taken together, our results show that, across the class of screened fifth-force models we analyze, the calibration of the local distance ladder remains essentially unchanged, leaving the Hubble tension intact.",

Fromm, Yosuke Mizuno, Sergio Servidio, Antonios Nathanail, Ziri Younsi, Luciano Rezzolla High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The recent 230 GHz observations by the Event Horizon Telescope have resolved the innermost structure of the M87 galaxy, revealing a ring-like feature consistent with thermal synchrotron emission from a magnetized torus surrounding a rotating supermassive black hole. Moreover, Global Millimeter VLBI Array observations at 86 GHz have revealed a larger-scale, edge-brightened jet with clear signatures of non-thermal emission. The theoretical modelling of these observations involves advanced general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetized accretion disks around rotating black holes, together with the associated synchrotron emission, which is normally treated with simplified expressions for the electron temperature and assuming a purely thermal distribution. However, an important non-thermal component is expected to be present, making the thermal-emission model not only an approximation, but also a source of degeneracy in the modelling. In view of this, we here present the first application of an ab-initio approach to the electron temperature derived from microscopic simulations of turbulent collisionless plasmas. The novel method, which has no tuneable coefficients and is fully specified by the thermodynamical and magnetic properties of the plasma, provides a better description of the jet morphology and width at 86 GHz, as well as of the broadband spectral emission. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating microscopic plasma physics in black-hole imaging and emphasise the crucial role of magnetic reconnection in electron heating and acceleration processes.",

Comments welcome! Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) predictions of primordial light-element abundances offer a powerful probe of early-Universe physics. However, high-accuracy numerical BBN calculations have become a major computational bottleneck for large-scale cosmological inferences due to the complex nuclear network. Here we present BBNet, a fast and accurate deep learning emulator for primordial abundances. The training data are generated by full numerical calculations using two public BBN codes, PArthENoPE and AlterBBN, modified to accommodate extended cosmologies that include dark radiation and a stiff equation of state. The network employs a residual multi-head architecture to capture convoluted physical relationships. BBNet produces primordial helium-4 and deuterium abundances with negligible errors in milliseconds per sample, achieving a speed-up of up to $10^4$ times relative to first-principles solvers while remaining unbiased over wide parameter ranges. Therefore, our emulator can supersede traditional simplified numerical prescriptions that compromise accuracy for speed. Based on extensive assessments of its performance, we conclude that BBNet is an optimal solution to the theoretical prediction of primordial element abundances. It will serve as a reliable tool for precision cosmology and new-physics searches.",

We begin by reviewing basic aspects of lattice field theory, including symplectic and non-symplectic evolution algorithms. We then introduce lattice implementations of non-canonical interactions, considering scalars with a non-minimal coupling to gravity, $\\phi^2R$, non-minimal scalar kinetic theories, $\\mathcal{G}_{ab}(\\lbrace\\phi_c\\rbrace)\\partial_\\mu\\phi^a\\partial^\\mu\\phi^b$, and axion-like particle (ALP) interactions with Abelian gauge fields, $\\phi F_{\\mu\\nu}\\tilde F^{\\mu\\nu}$. Next, we discuss methods to set up special field configurations, including the creation of cosmic defect networks towards scaling (e.g. cosmic strings and domain walls), field configurations based on arbitrary power spectra or spatial profiles, and probabilistic methods as required e.g. for thermal configurations. We further extend the notion of non-canonical theories, discussing the discretization of scalar field dynamics in $d + 1$ dimensions, with $d \\neq 3$. Unrelated to non-canonical aspects, we also discuss implementation(s) of gravitational wave (GW) dynamics on the lattice.

In this work, we investigate two distinct physical scenarios for the origin of bulk viscosity: (1) nonminimal interactions between two fluids, and (2) elastic collisions in an ideal gas. In both cases, we demonstrate that while the associated energy-momentum exchange can significantly influence fluid dynamics, overall energy-momentum conservation precludes such exchange from having any direct gravitational effect in the context of General Relativity. In case (1), we show that the standard bulk viscous energy-momentum tensor can be obtained for the two-fluid system only at the cost of the violation of all classical energy conditions: null, weak, dominant, and strong. In case (2), we consider a single fluid composed of point particles undergoing instantaneous, energy- and momentum-conserving collisions, and find that the proper pressure remains strictly non-negative, with the equation-of-state parameter confined to the interval $[0,1/3]$. In both scenarios, achieving a sufficiently negative effective pressure to drive cosmic acceleration requires assumptions that compromise the physical viability of the model.

Binary component spins have been proposed as a means to investigate formation channels, however obtaining clear inferences is challenging, given the apparently low magnitude of almost all merging BH spins and their high measurement uncertainties. Even for the effective aligned spin $\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ which is more precisely measured than component spins, specific model assumptions have been required to identify any clear trends. Here, we reconstruct the joint component mass and $\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ distribution of BBH mergers with minimal assumptions using the GWTC-3 catalog, using an iterative kernel density estimation (KDE)-based method. We reproduce some features seen in previous analyses, for instance a small but preferentially positive $\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for low-mass mergers; we also identify a possible subpopulation of higher-spin BBH with $|\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}|$ up to $\\sim\\! 0.75$ for primary masses $m_1 \\gtrsim 40\\,M_\\odot$, in addition to the bulk of the distribution with $|\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}| \\lesssim 0.2$.

Specifically, we use Basilisk, a Bayesian hierarchical tool for forward modeling the kinematics and abundance of satellite galaxies extracted from spectroscopic data, to first constrain the galaxy-halo connection precisely and accurately. We then demand self-consistency in that the galaxy-halo connection predicts the correct galaxy luminosity function, which constrains the halo mass function and thereby cosmology. Crucially, the method accounts for baryonic effects and is free of halo assembly bias issues. We validate the method against realistic SDSS-like mock data, demonstrating unbiased recovery of the input cosmology. Applying it to the SDSS-DR7, we infer that $\\Omega_{\\rm m} = 0.324 \\pm 0.012$, $\\sigma_8 = 0.775 \\pm 0.063$ and $S_8 \\equiv \\sigma_8 \\sqrt{\\Omega_{\\rm m}/0.3} = 0.81 \\pm 0.05$, in perfect agreement with the cosmic microwave background constraints from Planck. The most stringent constraint is with regard to the parameter combination $\\sigma_8 (\\Omega_{\\rm m}/0.3)^2$, which we infer to be $0.91 \\pm 0.05$. Hence, unlike many low-redshift analyses of large-scale structure data, we find no indication of $S_8$ tension. We demonstrate that these results are robust to reasonable variation in the implementation of baryonification used to model the host halo's gravitational potentials in response to baryonic processes. We also highlight the importance of correctly modeling the satellite radial profile in any analysis involving small-scale information. Finally, we underscore the hidden potential of this methodology for constraining baryonic physics using data from ongoing and upcoming surveys.",

ULDM is based on exceptionally light particles and yields galactic halos with dense central solitons. This increases the drag experienced by binary SMBH, decreasing merger times and potentially suppressing gravitational radiation from the binary at low frequencies. We develop semi-analytic models for the decay of SMBH binaries in ULDM halos and use current pulsar timing array (PTA) measurements to constrain the ULDM particle mass and its fractional contribution to the dark matter content of the universe. We find a median ULDM particle mass of $7. \\times 10^{-22}$ eV and show that scaling relations suggest that the drag remains effective at relatively low ULDM fractions, which are consistent with all other constraints on the model. Consequently, future pulsar timing measurements will be a sensitive probe of any ULDM contribution to the overall dark matter content of the universe.",

We present a science case for next-generation wide-field spectroscopic surveys targeting $1 < z < 6$ with simultaneous observations of thousands of galaxies, quasars, and emission-line galaxies. Such surveys would deliver transformative advances: (i) cosmological constraints on absolute neutrino masses ($\\Sigma m_\\nu \\lesssim 0.015\\,\\mathrm{eV}$), three times more stringent than Stage IV, enabling resolution of the neutrino mass hierarchy; (ii) detection of primordial non-Gaussianity at the level of $f_{\\mathrm{NL}} \\sim 1$, probing multi-field inflation; (iii) measurements of structure growth $f\\sigma_8(z)$ spanning cosmic time to constrain dark energy and test gravitational modifications. Achieving these goals requires revolutionary advances in spectroscopic multiplexing ($\\mathcal{O}(1000)$ simultaneous spectra), sub-$2\\times10^{-4}(1+z)$ redshift precision at scale, and field-level inference techniques exploiting higher-order clustering statistics. We demonstrate that the proposed Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope concept provides a technically feasible and scientifically compelling path to unlock the physics of neutrinos, inflation, and gravity that will remain inaccessible to Stage IV surveys.",

      "abstract": "Comparing cosmic shear nulling methods for Stage-IV surveys Naomi Clare Robertson, Alex Hall Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present an analysis comparing nulling strategies for reducing the impact of baryon feedback on cosmic shear measurements. We consider three different approaches which aim to `null' the high-$k$ modes using transformations applied to the data vector: the Bernardeau-Nishimichi-Taruya (BNT) transform which operates on the lensing field, a new implementation of an LU factorisation of the discretized Limber integral (LUnul) which operates on the lensing two-point statistics, and finally a method which uses a correlated LSS tracers to suppress contributions from lower redshifts (cross-correlation). We compare these methods to un-nulled (or standard) cosmic shear at the data vector level and assess whether these methods are able to reduce the bias on cosmological constraints using a Fisher forecast. We find that the nulling techniques considered can have a large impact on reducing the bias on $S_8$ and Dark Energy parameters. The cross-correlation method is effective at reducing biases in $S_8$, but requires additional information from galaxy clustering. The LUnul method is the most aggressive of the methods and hence reduces biases most efficiently as $k_{\\rm max}$ is increased, although this improvement in accuracy comes at the cost of precision. The BNT approach preserves more information than LUnul, and has a more rigorous theoretical grounding. We demonstrate that all three of these methods are effective at mitigating bias, and can be readily applied in forthcoming lensing analyses.",

This faint realm holds the keys to completing our understanding of galaxy evolution, hierarchical assembly, and even the fundamental nature of dark matter. Our current theoretical models are inherently incomplete, largely mirroring the properties of the brightest, most easily observed objects. To overcome this critical bias and unlock the secrets of this realm, a transformative leap in observational capability is required. A 30 to 40m class telescope, leveraging unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution, especially with adaptive optics, is the essential tool to fundamentally probe these faint, low-density stellar regimes.

Cosmic void catalogs were constructed using a watershed-based void-finding algorithm, and we define four populations of field galaxies for our investigation: [1] galaxies that are members of a watershed void, [2] galaxies that are located within a radius $r \\leq 0.8 R_{\\rm eff}$ of the center of a void, [3] galaxies interior to spheres centered on void centers that have underdensity contrasts $<-0.8$, and [4] non-void galaxies. We show that population statistics on void galaxy properties can be recovered from watershed-based void catalogs. Differences between galaxy populations are most pronounced interior to the shell-crossing surface (i.e., population [3]) where densities are intermediate to high. Compared to non-void galaxies at all redshifts, the density controlled galaxies are bluer, smaller, more actively star forming, more massive, and less metal enriched. At redshifts $\\geq 1$, these differences are less apparent, likely caused by resolution and selection effects incurred by attempting to define a density-controlled sample from a watershed-based void finding algorithm. Further, we investigate the fraction of galaxies with Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and find that our density controlled population has AGN fractions that are significantly higher than those of non-void galaxy population ($79.8 \\pm 0.4$\\% higher at $z=0.0$ and $61.5\\pm 0.7$\\% higher at larger redshifts).",

Cover page plus 3 pages, 1 figure Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) By the 2040s, several all-sky surveys will have transformed our view of the large-scale structure. However, one of the major outstanding questions in astrophysics will remain: understanding how galaxies acquire and evolve their angular momentum and how this connects to the cosmic web. Measuring the alignments between galaxy spins and cosmic filaments across cosmic time, and understanding what this reveals about galaxy evolution, requires surveys that also characterise intrinsic alignments, i.e. correlations in galaxy shapes produced by the cosmic web itself rather than by lensing. Intrinsic alignments are a major source of systematic error in weak-lensing measurements of the fundamental parameters of the Universe. Addressing both questions together will necessitate new types of MOS surveys that combine kinematic information with high-completeness redshifts down to at least 24-25mag. To achieve our science goals, we require a new generation of wide-field spectroscopic facilities that can obtain spin-filament alignment measurements for millions of galaxies while simultaneously delivering sub-Mpc resolution of the cosmic web and spatially-resolved kinematics required to map the spin-filament connection at the level of individual galaxies within their local cosmic environment. Such a program would provide a unique legacy survey of galaxies and cosmic structures from kiloparsec to megaparsec scales, establishing ESO's leadership in bridging the physics of galaxy evolution with the systematic-control requirements for Stage-IV cosmological surveys.",

With groundbreaking discoveries ranging from the first detailed images of protoplanetary disks to the kinematics of galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization, ALMA has showcased the vast discovery potential of the (sub-)mm wavelength regime. However, in another 15 years from now--in the 2040s--the science landscape will have changed dramatically as new major observational facilities will have started their operations or have come towards advanced maturity in their scientific outcome (e.g., JWST, Rubin Observatory, ELT, Euclid, Gaia, Plato, Ariel, Roman Space Telescope, SPHEREx, LiteBIRD, LISA, SKA and others). At the same time, ALMA's current Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade will have been in place for ~10 years, and ALMA itself will have been operational for 30 years. To fully exploit this era, the community needs a next-generation facility operating at (sub-)mm wavelengths with capabilities far beyond those possible within ALMA's current infrastructure. To this end, ALMA2040 is a community-driven initiative to define the key scientific questions of the 2040s and translate them into a technical vision for a next-generation transformational (sub-)millimeter facility. Our goal with this document is to summarize the current status of the effort, synthesize outcomes from the 2025 workshops, outline next steps toward a reference design concept, and invite broad participation from the global mm/sub-mm community to help shape this future facility. In the following we provide details on the process and scope. We invite everyone who wishes to join the effort and/or contribute to the dedicated White Papers planned for 2026.",

Roberts, R. van Weeren 13 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The environment plays an important role in shaping the evolution of cluster galaxies through mechanisms such as ram pressure stripping (RPS), whose effect may be enhanced in merging clusters. We investigate a complex of three galaxies UGC 6697, CGCG 097-073 and CGCG 097-079, that are currently undergoing extreme RPS, as evident from their multi-wavelength-detected tails. The galaxies are members of the nearby ($d=92$ Mpc) merging cluster Abell 1367 and are located in proximity to an intracluster medium (ICM) shock that is traced by X-ray observations and the presence of a radio relic. We analyze LOFAR and MeerKAT observations at frequencies of 54, 144, 817 and 1270 MHz to perform a detailed spectral analysis of the tails. We find that all three tails are significantly more extended than in previous radio studies, with lengths $\\geq70$ kpc. For UGC 6697, we detected a tail of 300 kpc, making it the longest known RPS tail of a star-forming galaxy at any wavelength. The length and spectral variations of the tail cannot be explained purely by the spectral aging of stripped cosmic rays. We construct a model of the tail that includes compression and re-acceleration due to the encounter with the nearby ICM shock, which can plausibly account for the extreme RPS as well as the length and spectral variation of the tail. We further discover a radio plume at the leading edge of UGC 6697 that connects to a narrow filament. These sources exhibit extremely steep ($\\alpha\\approx-1.7$) and highly curved spectra. We speculate that this emission arises from cosmic rays re-energized by UGC 6697's rapid infall which propagate along magnetic filaments in the cluster center. Our findings represent direct evidence of a cluster merger shock impacting the evolution of member galaxies. Furthermore, we report the first tentative detection of particle acceleration at the leading edge of an infalling galaxy.",

The dark matter annihilation rate scales with its density squared and becomes inhomogeneously boosted with structure formation. This paper examines the inhomogeneity in DM annihilation rate induced by the growth of DM halo structures, and we show that this effect can significantly amplify the spatial fluctuations in temperature and ionization fraction of the gas. Consequently, the fluctuations in the 21-cm brightness temperature may also be enhanced. We showcase these effects for a DM mass of 100 MeV annihilating into $\\rm{e}^-\\rm{e}^+$ at a rate of $\\left<\\sigma v\\right>/m_\\chi \\sim 10^{-27} {\\rm cm^3 s^{-1} GeV^{-1}}$, which is consistent with current constraints set by the cosmic microwave background. We find that, compared to the homogeneous calculations, inhomogeneous annihilation can enhance the 21-cm power spectrum by up to a factor of 130 over the scales of $k \\in [0.05, 3]\\ {\\rm{Mpc^{-1}}}$ at redshifts $11-16$.

Future wide-field cadenced surveys, such as the LSST, are anticipated to discover strong lenses across various scales. We generate mock catalogs of strongly lensed QSOs and SNe on galaxy-, group-, and cluster-scales based on a halo model that incorporates dark matter halos, galaxies, and subhalos. For the upcoming LSST survey, we predict that approximately 4000 lensed QSOs and 200 lensed SNe with resolved multiple images will be discovered. Among these, about 80 lensed QSOs and 10 lensed SNe will have maximum image separations larger than 10 arcsec, which roughly correspond to cluster-scale strong lensing. We find that adopting the Chabrier stellar IMF instead of the fiducial Salpeter IMF reduces the predicted number of strong lenses approximately by half, while the distributions of lens and source redshifts and image separations are not significantly changed. In addition to mock catalogs of multiple-image lens systems, we create mock catalogs of highly magnified systems, including both multiple-image and single-image systems. We find that such highly magnified systems are typically produced by massive galaxies, but non-negligible fraction of them are located in the outskirt of galaxy groups and clusters. Furthermore, we compare subsamples of our mock catalogs with lensed QSO samples constructed from the SDSS and Gaia to find that our mock catalogs with the fiducial Salpeter IMF reproduce the observation quite well. In contrast, our mock catalogs with the Chabrier IMF predict a significantly smaller number of lensed QSOs compared with observations, which adds evidence that the stellar IMF of massive galaxies is Salpeter-like. Our python code SL-Hammocks as well as the mock catalogs are made available online. (abridged)",

D 112, 123019 (2025) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Primordial black holes (PBHs) have been explored as potential dark matter candidates, with various astrophysical observations placing upper limits on the fraction $f_\\mathrm{PBH}$ of dark matter in the form of PBHs. However, a largely underutilized probe of PBH abundance is the temperature of the intergalactic medium (IGM), inferred from the thermal broadening of absorption lines in the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest of quasar spectra. PBHs inject energy into the IGM via Hawking radiation, altering its thermal evolution. In this work, we constrain this energy injection by self-consistently modeling its interplay with the cosmological ultraviolet background from galaxies and supermassive black holes. Leveraging IGM temperature measurements spanning the past twelve billion years ($z \\sim 0$ to $6$), we derive one of the most stringent constraints on PBH-induced heating from light PBHs within the mass range $10^{15}$-$10^{17}$ g. Specifically, for $M_\\mathrm{PBH} = 10^{16}$ g, we find $f_\\mathrm{PBH} < 5 \\times 10^{-5}$ at 95\\% confidence, with the bound scaling approximately as $M_\\mathrm{PBH}^{4}$ at other masses. Our inclusion of helium reionization and low-redshift temperature measurements strengthens previous IGM-based PBH constraints by an order of magnitude or more. Compared to other existing limits, our result is among the strongest, second only to the constraints from the 511 keV line from the Galactic Center, but with distinct systematics. More broadly, this study highlights the IGM thermal history as a powerful and independent probe of beyond-standard model physics.",

Croft, Tiziana Di Matteo, Yihao Zhou, Fabio Pacucci, Yueying Ni, Nianyi Chen, Simeon Bird Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present simulated counterparts of the ``Little Red Dot'' (LRD) galaxies observed with JWST, using the large cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, ASTRID. We create mock observations of the galaxies ($5 \\leq z \\leq 8$) in ASTRID, and find seventeen which fit the color and size criteria of LRDs. These LRDs are galaxies with high stellar masses ($\\rm log(M_*/M_{\\odot}) \\geq 9.7$), and massive black holes ($\\rm log(M_{BH}/M_{\\odot}) \\geq 6.8$). The host galaxies are dense, with stellar half mass radii ($\\rm 325\\,pc \\leq r_{{\\rm half},*} \\leq 620\\,pc$), and dust attenuation in the F444W band above 1.25. Their star formation has been recently quenched. They host relatively bright AGN that are dust-obscured and contribute significantly to the rest-frame optical red slope and have relatively low luminosity in the rest-frame ultraviolet, where the host galaxy's stars are more dominant. These LRDs are in an evolutionary phase of miniquenching that is the result of AGN feedback from their massive black holes. The LRDs in ASTRID are bright with F444W magnitudes of $23.5-25.5$. The less massive and fainter galaxies in ASTRID lack the dust concentration necessary to produce the red slope of an LRD, though this could be an effect of limited resolution. Most of the highest Eddington black holes are not LRDs due to insufficient dust attenuation from their host galaxies, which are also experiencing relatively high star formation rates. This results in their spectra being too flat, despite their highly accreting black holes.",

We explore the Generalized Emergent Dark Energy (GEDE) model using recent BAO measurements from DESI DR2, Type Ia supernova compilations, and CMB distance priors. Employing nested sampling, we constrain the parameter $\\Delta$, which characterizes deviations from $\\Lambda$CDM. Our analysis shows that with CMB+DESI DR2 alone, GEDE tends to prefer positive values of $\\Delta$. However, when different SNe Ia calibrations are included, the model favors negative values of $\\Delta$, corresponding to an earlier injection of dark energy. The Marginalized constraints on $\\omega(z)$ further shows that GEDE sharply emerges but then asymptotes to $\\omega=-1$ without crossing it. At $z \\sim 1$ data, GEDE provides a better fit than $\\Lambda$CDM, while at $z \\lesssim 0.5$ the data favor $\\omega > -1$, bringing the model deviate from $\\Lambda$CDM. Bayesian model comparison shows weak support for GEDE with CMB+DESI DR2 ($\\ln BF=1.96$), moderate with PP ($\\ln BF=2.65$), weak-to-moderate with Union3 ($\\ln BF=2.34$), and weak with DES-SN5Y ($\\ln BF=1.44$). Overall, GEDE is consistent with current data and mildly favored when SNe Ia are included, making it a viable extension of $\\Lambda$CDM that merits further investigation with future high precision measurements.",

Bagla 15 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables. Accepted for publication in the MNRAS Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The atomic hydrogen HI content of galaxies is intimately related to star formation and galaxy evolution through the baryon cycle, which involves processes such as accretion, feedback, outflows, and gas recycling. While probing the HI gas over cosmic time has improved our understanding, direct HI detection with the redshifted 21 cm line is essentially limited to $z\\lesssim 0.42$. Detections beyond this redshift are based on stacking to obtain average HI mass of galaxy populations. Gravitational lensing by the cluster lenses enhances the HI signal and can extend the redshift limit further. In this work, we describe simulations of HI lensing in cluster lenses. We explore the feasibility of detecting strongly lensed HI emission from background galaxies using known $50$ cluster lenses within the uGMRT sky coverage. We demonstrate that certain clusters offer a strong likelihood of HI detection. We also investigate how strong lensing distorts the HI spectral lines. The shape of the HI signal in these lensing models provides useful information and can be used in optimising signal extraction in blind and targeted HI surveys. We find that blind detection of HI signal from galaxies in the redshift range up to $1.58$ requires more than a few hundred hours of observations of individual clusters with the uGMRT. Detecting HI emission in galaxies with strong optical lensing seems promising, with a $5\\sigma$ detection potential in less than 50 hours for Abell 370 and 75 hours for Abell 1703 using the uGMRT.",

The evolution and decay of these strings source a stochastic gravitational-wave background that may be probed by current and future gravitational-wave experiments, while the decays of the resulting massive right-handed neutrinos can generate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis. We derive analytical bounds for successful leptogenesis with a global and a local $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, separately finding an absolute lower bound on the lightest right-handed neutrino mass $M_1 > 1.74 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$ for thermal initial conditions and $M_1 > \\mathcal{O}(10^{6})\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$ for non-thermal initial conditions. Allowing for near-resonant leptogenesis relaxes these bounds to TeV scale in both cases making it a viable target at collider searches complementing the GW signals. Full flavour effects are included, and crucially, we determine the region where successful leptogenesis can be probed through gravitational-wave observations in upcoming experiments such as LISA and Einstein Telescope.

We aim to measure the inter-band continuum time delays through photometric monitoring of Seyfert galaxy Fairall 9 to construct the lag-spectrum. Additionally, we explain the observed features in the Fairall 9 lag-spectrum and discuss the potential drivers behind them, based on our newly collected data from the Obserwatorium Cerro Murphy (OCM) telescope. We initiated a long-term, continuous AGN photometric monitoring program in 2024, titled 'Hubble constant constraints through AGN Light curve Observations' (HALO) using intermediate and broad band filters. Here, we present the first results from HALO, focusing on photometric light curves and continuum time-delay measurements for Fairall 9. To complement these observations and extend the wavelength coverage of the lag-spectrum, we also reanalyzed archival Swift light curves and spectroscopic data available in the literature. Using HALO and Swift light curves, we measured inter-band continuum delays to construct the lag-spectrum of Fairall 9. Excess lags appear in the $u$ and $U$ bands (Balmer continuum contamination) and in the $I$ band (Paschen jump/dust emission from the torus). Overall, the lag-spectrum deviates significantly from standard disk model predictions. We find that inter-band delays deviate from the power-law, $\\tau_{\\lambda} \\propto \\lambda^{\\beta}$ due to BLR scattering, reprocessing, and dust contributions at longer wavelengths. Power-law fits are therefore not well suited for characterizing the nature of the time delays.",

Metzger, Yan-Fei Jiang, Andrea Antoni 26 pages, 21 figures and Appendix High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The formation of a compact accretion disk following a tidal disruption event (TDE) requires that the shocked stellar debris cool efficiently as it settles toward the black hole. While recent simulations suggest that stream dissipation occurs rapidly, how the weakly bound debris subsequently loses its thermal energy to assemble a compact disk near the circularization radius remains uncertain. We investigate this cooling process using axisymmetric radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of quasi-hydrostatic 'TDE envelopes', initialized with the total mass, angular momentum, and binding energy expected from a complete stellar disruption. The envelopes, supported by radiation pressure on large scales and rotation near the circularization radius, evolve through a combination of radiative diffusion, turbulent mixing, and polar outflows. In our fiducial model, a quasi-steady state is achieved in which a polar outflow radiates and expels matter at several times the Eddington luminosity. This enables the envelope to cool and contract, forming a dense, rotationally supported ring near the circularization radius, but on a timescale roughly ten times shorter than the naive photon-diffusion timescale. Comparative models without radiation transport confirm that cooling, not purely adiabatic evolution, is essential to driving this rapid inflow. Nevertheless, across a range of envelope masses, the effective envelope cooling time scales only weakly with its optical depth, implying that advective and wind-driven energy transport dominate over diffusion. Our results demonstrate the cooling-induced contraction, even absent viscosity and associated black hole accretion, can produce luminosities and large photosphere radii consistent with early UV/optical TDE emission. However, more quantitative light-curve predictions must incorporate self-consistent formation and feeding of the envelope by fall-back accretion.",

Perets, Ramandeep Gill, Paz Beniamini, Brendan O'Connor High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) GRB$\\;$250702B is the longest GRB recorded so far, with multiple gamma-ray emission episodes spread over a duration exceeding $25\\;$ks and a weaker soft X-ray pre-peak $\\sim1\\;$day gradually rising emission. It is offset from its host galaxy center by $\\sim5.7\\;$kpc, and displays a long-lived afterglow emission in radio to X-ray. Its true nature is unclear, with the two leading candidate classes of objects being a peculiar type of ultra-long GRB and a tidal disruption event (TDE) by an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH). Here, we consider the latter, mTDE origin. We model the afterglow data, finding a stratified external density profile $\\propto r^{-k}$ with $k=1.60\\pm0.17$, consistent with Bondi accretion of the interstellar medium (of initial number density $n_{\\rm ISM}=n_0\\;{\\rm cm^{-3}}$ and sound speed $c_s=c_{s,6}10^6\\;{\\rm cm\\,s^{-1}}$) for which $n(r)\\approx n_{\\rm ISM}(r/R_{\\rm B})^{-3/2}$ within the Bondi radius $R_{\\rm B}$. Moreover, we use the implied density normalization to infer the IMBH mass within this model, finding $M_\\bullet\\approx\\left(6.55^{+3.51}_{-2.29}\\right)\\times10^3\\,n_0^{-2/3}\\,c_{s,6}^{2}(1+\\mathcal{M}^2)\\;M_\\odot$ where $\\mathcal{M}\\equiv v_{\\rm BH}/c_s$ is the IMBH's Mach number relative to the ISM.

We show that a mTDE of a main-sequence star (but not of a white dwarf) can explain the duration and energetics of GRB$\\;$250702B. The gradual rise to the peak may be caused by gradual circularization and accretion disk buildup, leading to an increase in the jet's power and Lorentz factor.",

MSPs are bright GeV gamma-ray emitters, and all-sky monitoring of about 100 MSPs with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has enabled a gamma-ray Pulsar Timing Array. The GPTA provides a complementary view of nHz GWs because its MSP sample is different, and because the gamma-ray data are immune to plasma propagation effects, have minimal data gaps, and rely on homogeneous instrumentation. To assess GPTA performance for future gamma-ray observatories, we simulated the population of Galactic MSPs and developed a high-fidelity method to predict their gamma-ray spectra. This combination reproduces the properties of the LAT MSP sample, validating it for future population studies. We determined the expected signal from the simulated gamma-ray MSPs for instrument concepts with a wide range of capabilities. We found that the optimal GPTA energy range runs about 0.1 to 5 GeV, but we also examined Compton/MeV instruments. With the caveat that the MSP spectra models are extrapolated beyond observational constraints, we found low signal-to-background ratios, yielding few MSP detections. GeV-band concepts would detect 10$^3$ to 10$^4$ MSPs and achieve GW sensitivity on par with and surpassing the current generation of radio PTAs, reaching the GW self-noise regime. When considering two possible scenarios for the formation of MSPs in the Galactic bulge, the collective signal from which is a potential source of an excess GeV signal observed towards the Galactic center, we find that most of the concepts can both detect this bulge population and distinguish the production channel. In summary, the high discovery potential, strong GW performance, and tremendous synergy with radio PTAs all argue for the pursuit of next-generation gamma-ray pulsar timing.",

The 2040s will bring transformative capabilities: wide-field optical surveys discovering tens of thousands of optical transients nightly, proposed high-energy missions like THESEUS providing 10-100x improved high-energy monitoring, and third-generation gravitational wave detectors identifying $\\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ compact object mergers annually, many accompanied by relativistic jets. This industrial-scale discovery rate will enable population studies addressing fundamental questions such as jet launching mechanisms, nucleosynthesis, the first stars, and how progenitor environments shape these transients across cosmic time. However, realizing this science requires overcoming a critical bottleneck: these transients evolve on timescales of seconds to days, with their physics encoded in rapidly-changing multi-wavelength signatures demanding immediate spectroscopic characterization down to m ~ 25. Current facilities, optimized for classical/queue scheduling, do not provide the rapid, flexible, multi-target response necessary for industrial-scale follow-up. This white paper demonstrates that without a dedicated large-aperture (10-30 m effective collecting area) time-domain facility with robotic scheduling and optical-NIR spectroscopic capabilities, the transformative potential of relativistic transient science in the 2040s will be considerably limited.",

Harding, Demosthenes Kazanas, Dimitrios Skiathas 30 pages, 11 figures, submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a framework that links equatorial-current-sheet (ECS) physics to catalog-lelvel phase-averaged gamma-ray pulsar properties. Guided by analytic scalings and 3D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we show that the pulsar \"Fundamental Plane\" (relating gamma-ray luminosity, spectral cutoff energy, spin-down power $\\dot{\\cal{E}}$, and surface magnetic field) is bounded by two regimes: a radiation-reaction-limited branch and a potential-drop-limited branch. Their intersection defines a transition in $\\dot{\\cal{E}}$ that maps to a gamma-ray visibility threshold on the $P-\\dot{P}$ diagram, above which detectability is set by distance and beaming, and below which both cutoff energy and efficiency decline rapidly. Placing ATNF pulsars and McGill magnetars onto these planes reproduces the observed Fermi occupancy, with millisecond pulsars (MSPs) on the observable side, young pulsars (YPs) straddling the threshold, and magnetars clustering at or just below it. At higher $\\dot{\\cal{E}}$, both MSPs and YPs depart from the maximal radiation-reaction-limited envelope at similar cutoff energies, suggesting that enhanced pair creation screens the accelerating electric field in the ECS. We interpret this behavior with a compactness-based criterion for optically thin $\\gamma\\gamma$ pair feedback in or near the ECS and briefly note an extension to $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow\\mu^\\pm$ that could yield pulsed multi-TeV neutrinos in the most energetic systems. The framework predicts an MeV-bright, GeV-faint corridor below current Fermi sensitivity, a target for next-generation MeV missions. Finally, motivated by the recent HESSII detection of pulsed multi-TeV emission from Vela, we use PIC particle distributions with a simple seed-photon model to reproduce a multi-TeV inverse-Compton component alongside the GeV curvature emission, supporting a unified ECS-based GeV-TeV origin.",

The multiwavelength follow-up observations of the early afterglow of GRB 240825A provided insights into the evolution of the optical-to-X-ray spectral feature of the afterglow. We comprehensively investigate the evolution of X-ray spectral properties through time-resolved spectral analysis and calculate optical darkness ($\\beta_\\mathrm{OX}$) to reveal the physical properties of the afterglow. The X-ray-to-optical SEDs of afterglow in different time intervals are fitted to derive the extinction curves. The $\\beta_\\mathrm{OX}$ exhibits a trend of decreasing and then increasing, reaching its minimum value at $\\sim1000\\mathrm{\\,s}$ post-trigger. However, at 11 hours post-trigger, $\\beta_\\mathrm{OX}$ does not meet the criteria for an optically dark burst.

Lemoine (APC) Highlight talk presented at the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2025) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) This proceedings paper reports on the theoretical modelling of particle acceleration in magnetised turbulent plasmas. It briefly reviews some recent findings obtained from fully kinetic numerical simulations of large-amplitude, semi to fully relativistic turbulence. The paper then argues that these findings can be understood within the framework of a ``generalised Fermi'' picture of stochastic acceleration, which it summarises. The dominant contributions to acceleration appear to arise from particle interactions with sharp, dynamic bends of the magnetic field lines and regions of velocity compression. Interestingly, the acceleration rate is spatially inhomogeneous and its probability distribution follows a broken power law extending up to large values. This makes relativistic, large-amplitude turbulence an extreme particle accelerator. Some implications for particle transport and the shape of the particle energy spectrum in the presence of radiative losses and over long timescales are also discussed.",

Although the spectrum at latitudes |b| > 10° has a softening or a cutoff around 100 GeV, the one at the base of the FBs, |b| <10°, extends up to about 1 TeV without a significant cutoff in the Fermi LAT data. The mechanism behind the FBs production is currently under debate. More observations of the FBs at different energies are required to improve our understanding of their origin. Recently, H.E.S.S. and HAWC observatory have set upper limits on the FBs. In this work, we assess the sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) using the \"alpha configuration\" in the South site to detect the FBs and investigate the optimal strategies for their detection at low latitudes. We simulate the observations using the official CTAO science tool gammapy, considering several benchmark models for the FBs and the interstellar emission and test different observational strategies taking advantage of the proposed CTAO consortium surveys. We use these simulations to estimate the CTAO sensitivity to the FBs.",

In contrast to purely leptonic models, this work investigates whether hadronic mechanisms can explain the observed gamma-ray spectra by analyzing the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of a chosen sample of FSRQs (Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasars). By incorporating both hadronic and leptonic components into their multi-wavelength modeling, we evaluate the model's feasibility to simultaneously describe the data collected by Fermi-LAT and neutrinos detected by IceCube.

They represent ideal laboratories to test the models of binary evolution, which also apply to the sources of gravitational waves, whose detection led to the award of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Moreover, their final fate is intimately linked to Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), i.e. the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf following the interaction with a companion star, which have become the fundamental yardsticks on cosmological distance scales and led to the discovery of dark energy and the award of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. Finally, white dwarf binaries play a crucial role in influencing star formation and chemical evolution of the Galaxy by injecting energy into, and enriching, the interstellar medium with material ejected during nova eruptions and SN Ia explosions. In the next decade, the advent of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) at the Vera Rubin Observatory will lead to the discovery of hundreds of thousands of white dwarf binaries. Nonetheless, the intrinsic faintness of the majority of these systems will prevent their spectroscopic characterisation with the instruments available in the 2030s. Hence ESO's Expanding Horizons call is timely for planning a future transformative facility, capable of delivering phase-resolved spectroscopic observations of faint white dwarf binaries, which are key to advancing our understanding of stellar and Galactic evolution and cosmology.",

In 2040s, the urgency of resolving long-standing questions regarding the physics behind the dynamical interaction stages and the absolute and relative frequencies of binary evolutionary pathways will only increase owing to rapidly expanding population statistics of gravitational wave events. Here, we argue that multi-wavelength observations (spectroscopy and photometry), linear spectropolarimetry, and interferometry of a large number of Luminous Red Novae, a particular class of transients associated with dynamical binary interactions, will provide unprecedented details about the underlying interaction physics. A breakthrough will be achieved by a tenfold or larger increase in identifications of transient-type events from interacting binaries and their follow-up with instrumentation that provides at least 10 times better angular resolution, 100 times better spectral resolution, and $\\sim$100 times higher sensitivity than 2030s facilities.",

Pursiainen White paper submitted for the ESO Expanding Horizons initiative Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs) are a class of extragalactic transient of uncertain origin. Several hypotheses have been put forward which could feasibly be consistent with the sample number of events discovered thus far, including tidal disruption events around intermediate mass black holes, failed supernovae and mergers of stars with black holes. Whatever their origin, it is clear that better understanding LFBOTs will provide unique insight into the black hole formation/growth, central engine physics and transient-host galaxy interactions - themes which are expected to drive research in transient astronomy over the coming decades. The vast majority of LFBOTs are missed by current photometric surveys, or not efficiently selected for detailed follow-up. This white paper outlines the observing capabilities required on a 2040 timescale to maximise the discovery potential from these enigmatic events.",

Published in PASJ as open access Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan (2025): psaf124 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) A high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic observation was made of the RS CVn-type binary star HR 1099 using the Resolve instrument onboard XRISM for its calibration purposes. During the $\\sim$400 ks telescope time covering 1.5 binary orbit, a flare lasting for $\\sim$100 ks was observed with a released X-ray radiation energy of $\\sim 10^{34}$ erg, making it the first stellar flare ever observed with an X-ray microcalorimeter spectrometer. The flare peak count rate is 6.4 times higher than that in quiescence and is distinguished clearly in time thanks to the long telescope time. Many emission lines were detected in the 1.7--10 keV range both in the flare and quiescent phases. Using the high spectral resolution of Resolve in the Fe K band (6.5--7.0 keV), we resolved the inner-shell lines of Fe XIX--XXIV as well as the outer-shell lines of Fe XXV--XXVI. These lines have peaks in the contribution functions at different temperatures over a wide range, allowing us to construct the differential emission measure (DEM) distribution over the electron temperature of 1--10 keV (roughly 10--100 MK) based only on Fe lines, thus without an assumption of the elemental abundance. The reconstructed DEM has a bimodal distribution, and only the hotter component increased during the flare. The elemental abundance was derived based on the DEM distribution thus constructed. A significant abundance increase was observed during the flare for Ca and Fe, which are some of the elements with the lowest first ionization potential among those analyzed, but not for Si, S, and Ar. This behavior is seen in some giant solar flares and the present result is a clear example in stellar flares.",

Neutrino flux from astrophysical sources is reduced in the pseudo-Dirac scenario due to the conversion of active-to-sterile neutrinos as compared to the neutrino oscillation scenario of only three active neutrinos over astrophysical distances. We fit IceCube data using astrophysical flux models for four point-like sources in both scenarios and constrain the active-sterile mass-square-difference in the absence of any evidence for the pseudo-Dirac scenario. We present the exclusion regions for the common mass-squared difference $\\delta m^2$, inducing active-sterile oscillations, for all three neutrino flavors. This includes results from individual sources as well as from a stacking analysis that combines data from the four sources. Our findings indicate that the exclusion region is $\\delta m^2 \\in [2.1\\times 10^{-21} - 2.0\\times 10^{-16}]$ eV$^2$ with $\\ge 90\\%$ confidence level (CL) significance for neutrino energies ranging from 0.5 TeV to 1 PeV.

Our method integrates CRPropa 3 simulations, including all relevant interactions and magnetic deflections in both Galactic and extra-Galactic fields, with Approximate Bayesian Computation to infer posterior distributions over key parameters such as source position, distance, energy, and magnetic field properties. This approach allows joint constraints from the observed energy and arrival direction to be applied simultaneously, naturally incorporating their correlations in addition to relevant modelling uncertainties. We demonstrate our method by applying it to the Amaterasu particle detected by the Telescope Array observatory, the second-highest-energy cosmic ray ever detected. The resulting posterior distributions quantify the regions of space consistent with its reconstructed properties under different energy and composition assumptions, revealing a broader set of nearby source candidates than found in previous analyses. This application highlights the framework's ability to translate individual UHECR observations into directly interpretable source constraints and provides a foundation for future simulation-based analyses of cosmic rays at the highest energies.",

Using over 17 years of Fermi-LAT observations, we report the first significant detection ($8\\sigma$ in likelihood analysis) of the system in the 10-100 GeV energy range, over orbital phases from -400 to +100 days relative to periastron. The observed spectrum is well described by a power law with photon index $\\Gamma = 1.9 \\pm 0.1$ and shows a flux level consistent with that measured at TeV energies by H.E.S.S. The smooth connection between the Fermi-LAT and TeV spectra suggests that the detected multi-GeV emission traces the rising tail of the inverse-Compton component extending into the TeV regime. The presence of detectable emission hundreds of days before periastron indicates high-energy activity over a larger orbital phase range than previously established, enabling new constraints on particle-acceleration and radiative processes in the system.",

Beloborodov, Elena Popova 17 pages, 8 figures, accepted to ApJL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Extended periods of radio pulsations have been observed for six magnetars, displaying characteristics different from those of ordinary pulsars. In this Letter, we argue that radio emission is generated in a closed, twisted magnetic flux bundle originating near the magnetic pole and extending beyond 100 km from the magnetar. The electron-positron flow in the twisted bundle has to carry electric current and, at the same time, experiences a strong drag by the radiation field of the magnetar. This combination forces the plasma into a ``radiatively locked'' state with a sustained two-stream instability, generating radio emission. We demonstrate this mechanism using novel first-principles simulations that follow the plasma behavior by solving the relativistic Vlasov equation with the discontinuous Galerkin method. First, using one-dimensional simulations, we demonstrate how radiative drag induces the two-stream instability, sustaining turbulent electric fields. When extended to two dimensions, the system produces electromagnetic waves, including superluminal modes capable of escaping the magnetosphere. We measure their frequency and emitted power, and incorporate the local simulation results into a global magnetospheric model. The model explains key features of observed radio emission from magnetars: its appearance after an X-ray outburst, wide pulse profiles, luminosities $\\sim 10^{30}{\\rm{erg/s}}$, and a broad range of frequencies extending up to $\\sim 100\\, \\mathrm{GHz}$.",

      "abstract": "Radio emission from beyond the light cylinder in millisecond pulsars Michael Kramer (MPIfR), Simon Johnston (CSIRO) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) A striking aspect of the radio profiles of many millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is that they consist of components separated from each other by regions lacking in emission. We devise a technique for determining \"disjoint\" from \"contiguous\" components and show that 35% of MSPs have disjoint components as opposed to only 3% of the slow pulsar population. We surmise that the pulsars with these disjoint components show evidence for both emission above the polar cap and from the current sheet beyond the light cylinder (LC), co-located with gamma-ray emission. For some of the radio MSPs only the LC emission is being observed. It is our contention that almost all of the current population of gamma-ray MSPs show evidence for co-located radio emission. A simple geometric explanation allows the presence (or not) of LC emission and the relationship (or not) between the gamma-ray and radio profiles to be determined. The LC components have frequently very high polarization and typically flat position-angle traverses thus helping to explain the difficulties in determining the geometry of MSPs. In cases where the geometry can be determined the values broadly align with expectations. In this picture, the number of potentially detectable radio MSPs is higher than previously thought, although the actual detectability of LC components depends on their luminosity function. A mechanism is required to produce coherent radio emission far from the stellar surface. These ideas have implications for our understanding of the populations of radio-loud and radio-quiet rotation-powered millisecond pulsars, and may have implications for the long-term timing stability of some of these sources.",

Accepted for publication in ApJL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) AT2025ulz is an optical/near-infrared transient discovered during follow-up of the candidate gravitational wave (GW) event S250818k. Its young age ($\\lesssim$1 d), rapid decline and strong color evolution over the first 48 hr classify it as a potential kilonova candidate. In this work, we present the results of our observing campaign, carried out with the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Although the early time evolution of AT2025ulz resembles some aspects of a kilonova, its rapid onset ($\\sim$3 hr after the GW trigger) and luminosity (a factor of $\\sim5$ brighter than AT2017gfo in $g$-band) are difficult to reproduce. Only a small subset of our kilonova models matches its multi-color light curve, and the inferred ejecta mass is uncomfortably large given the low chirp mass ($\\lesssim\\!0.87\\!$ M$_{\\odot}$) of the GW candidate. HST observations place the transient within a nearby ($z=0.08489$) spiral galaxy with on-going star-formation and measure a color ($F336W-F160W\\!\\approx\\!1.4$ mag) that is too blue to match with a kilonova. Our data support the classification of AT2025ulz as a supernova, initially undergoing a shock-cooling phase and later entering its photospheric phase, and spectroscopically identified via its broad absorption features.",

Using a modular back-tracing framework, we explore a set of widely used magnetic-field descriptions-from a Parker spiral baseline to more structured configurations that include latitudinal wind contrasts, Smith-Bieber-type azimuthal strengthening, and tilted or wavy heliospheric current sheets. We model the deterministic deflections of high-energy cosmic-ray electrons and positrons (CREs) induced by large-scale heliospheric magnetic-field structures using a back-tracing approach. Our results apply to CREs above tens of GeV, where diffusion, convection, and adiabatic energy losses play a subdominant role; these processes are neglected in the present study and will be addressed in future work. Across these models the picture is consistent: most bending is accumulated within the inner tens of astronomical units and decreases rapidly with energy. Field choices and solar-cycle geometry set the overall normalization, with stronger spiral winding or a more highly tilted current sheet producing larger deflections at the same energy. Differences between electrons and positrons are most apparent at lower energies, where drift histories and current-sheet encounters diverge, and become increasingly small at multi-TeV energies.

Accepted in MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), among the most compelling astrophysical phenomena, are potential candidates for exploring the evolution of energy distribution among magnetic fields and particles through multiwavelength observations. The fraction of energy transferred between particles and the magnetic field is governed by microphysical parameters, typically assumed to be constant during relativistic shocks but may in fact vary with time. In this work, we derive the light curves and closure relations (CRs) of the synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) process from the external reverse shock (RS) with variations of microphysical parameters in a homogeneous and stellar-wind medium. We consider the evolution of the RS in the thick- and thin-shell regimes. We demonstrate that, depending on the microphysical parameters, this process can mimic plateau phases and produce temporal decay indices steeper than those predicted by high-latitude emission alone. The current model is employed to examine the evolution of the spectral and temporal indices of GRBs reported in the Second Fermi-LAT Gamma-ray Burst Catalog (2FLGC) and bursts detected at very high energies, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations.",

Bal, Malgorzata Bogdan, Ye Li, Agnieszka Pollo, Dieter H. Hartmann, Bing Zhang, Simanta Deka, Nissim Fraija, J. Xavier Prochaska 39 pages, 18 figures, 7 Tables, Under Review at JHEAP High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most luminous explosions in the Universe and serve as powerful probes of the early cosmos. However, the rapid fading of their afterglows and the scarcity of spectroscopic measurements make photometric classification crucial for timely high-redshift identification. We present an ensemble machine learning framework for redshift classification of GRBs based solely on their optical plateau and prompt emission properties. Our dataset comprises 171 long GRBs observed by the Swift UVOT and more than 450 ground-based telescopes. The analysis pipeline integrates robust statistical techniques, including M-estimator outlier rejection, multivariate imputation using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations, and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator feature selection, followed by a SuperLearner ensemble combining parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric algorithms. The optimal model, trained on raw optical data with outlier removal at a redshift threshold of z equals 2.0, achieves a true positive rate of 74 percent and an area under the curve of 0.84, maintaining balanced generalization between training and test sets. At higher thresholds, such as z equals 3.0, the classifier sustains strong discriminative power with an area under the curve of 0.88. Validation on an independent GRB sample yields 97 percent overall accuracy, perfect specificity, and an ensemble area under the curve of 0.93. Compared to previous prompt- and X-ray-based classifiers, our optical framework offers enhanced sensitivity to high-redshift events, improved robustness against data incompleteness, and greater applicability to ground-based follow-up. We also publicly release a web application that enables real-time redshift classification, facilitating rapid identification of candidate high-redshift GRBs for cosmological studies.",

Wissel, R. Young, A. Zink Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det) The Radio Neutrino Observatory-Greenland (RNO-G, at Summit Station) experiment comprises an extensive fat-dipole antenna array deployed into ice boreholes over an eventual area of approximately 35 ${\\rm km}^2$. Since the RNO-G experimental sensitivity depends on the radio-frequency properties of the firn, which are known to vary laterally on sub-km distance scales and vertically on sub-meter distance scales, a technique for quickly extracting information on firn ice properties with depth ($n(z)$) during drilling and deployment is desirable. Given that a dipole's resonant wavelength is fixed by geometry, the resonant frequency $f_{res}$ (measured as an S-parameter reflection coefficient [`$S_{11}$'] minimum) scales inversely with the local refractive index, allowing a translation of a depth-dependent $S_{11}$(z) profile into $n(z)$. $S_{11}$(z) data were initially taken in August, 2024 using a dipole lowered into a newly-drilled $98\\pm 1$-mm diameter, 350-m deep borehole at Summit Station, Greenland, approximately 1 km from the site of the original GISP-2 core; improved measurements were subsequently made in May, 2025. We conclude that $S_{11}$(z) data can be used to estimate \\RIP, on 50 cm vertical scales, at the per-cent level of accuracy required by experiments such as RN0-G.",

We present simulations of a massive young star cluster using \\textsc{Nbody6++GPU} and \\textsc{MOCCA}. The cluster is initially more compact than previously published models, with one million stars, a total mass of $5.86 \\times 10^5~\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, and a half-mass radius of $0.1~\\mathrm{pc}$. Aims. We analyse the formation and growth of a very massive star (VMS) through successive stellar collisions and investigate the subsequent formation of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the core of a dense star cluster. Methods. We use both direct \\textit{N}-body and Monte Carlo simulations, incorporating updated stellar evolution prescriptions (SSE/BSE) tailored to massive stars and VMSs. These include revised treatments of stellar radii, rejuvenation, and mass loss during collisions. While the prescriptions represent reasonable extrapolations into the VMS regime, the internal structure and thermal state of VMSs formed through stellar collisions remain uncertain, and future work may require further refinement. Results. We find that runaway stellar collisions in the cluster core produce a VMS exceeding $5 \\times 10^4~\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ within 5 Myr, which subsequently collapses into an IMBH. Conclusions. Our model suggests that dense stellar environments may enable the formation of very massive stars and massive black hole seeds through runaway stellar collisions. These results provide a potential pathway for early black hole growth in star clusters and offer theoretical context for interpreting recent JWST observations of young, compact clusters at high redshift.",

In this paper we report high-cadence photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations, conducted from as early as 0.27 d post discovery out to the nebular phase at 158.4 d. We analyze the environment of SN 2024aecx and derive a new distance, metallicity and host extinction. The light curve exhibits a hot and luminous shock-cooling peak at the first few days, followed by a main peak with very rapid post-maximum decline. The earliest spectra are blue and featureless, while from 2.3 d after discovery prominent P-Cygni profiles emerge. At nebular phase, the emission lines exhibit asymmetric and double-peaked profiles, indicating asphericity and/or early dust formation in the ejecta. We simulated the progenitor and explosion using a two-component model of shock cooling and radioactive $^{56}$Ni heating; our model favors an extended, low-mass H-rich envelope with$ M_{\\mathrm{e}} = 0.08^{+0.02}_{-0.03}\\, M_{\\odot} $ and a low ejecta mass of $ M_{\\mathrm{ej}} = 2.65^{+1.21}_{-0.73} \\, M_{\\odot}. $The comprehensive monitoring of SN 2024aecx, coupled with the detailed characterization of its local environment, establishes it as a benchmark event for probing the progenitors and explosion mechanisms of Type IIb SNe.",

The galaxies lie within the magnitude range MV ~ -7.70 to -8.2 and half-light radii rh ~ 110 to 204 pc. Shapiro DG-I (Sha DG-I/MAGE1412+5650) is a concurrently discovered and isolated galaxy. Shapiro DG-II (Sha DG-II) is a fainter dwarf and potential companion to the SMC-mass galaxy NGC 5585 (D ~ 6.84 Mpc). Shapiro DG-III (Sha DG-III) is an isolated dwarf on the edge of the ultra-faint regime. Hydrodynamical simulations suggest a backsplash population of galaxies that have been environmentally stripped by interactions with a host and ejected from the system, though they have not yet been definitively observed in the local universe. Considering their quenched stellar populations, indicated by the lack of coincident GALEX emission, relative distances, and fitting models, the galaxies are consistent with a backsplash origin and are pending follow-up. Analysis is performed to test whether the system's population can be explained by standard cosmology. A potential correlation is found between satellite abundances and halo masses calibrated by tidal indices in a sample of nearby MW-like galaxies, suggesting the importance of environmental density in the formation of dark matter subhaloes, though a larger sample is required. M101's sparse satellite system fits well in the relation and is in agreement with {\\Lambda}CDM expectations.",

Pirzkal 17 pages, 19 figures, accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The dust content of star-forming galaxies is generally positively correlated with their stellar mass. However, some recent JWST studies have shown the existence of a population of dwarf galaxies with an unexpectedly large dust attenuation. Using the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) data, we identified a sample of 1361 highly extincted low-mass (HELM) galaxies, defined as dwarf galaxies ($M_*<10^{8.5}$) with Av>1mag or more massive galaxies with an exceptionally high dust attenuation given their stellar mass (i.e., $Av>1.6log_{10}(M_*/Mo)-12.6$). The selection is performed using the multiparameter distribution obtained through a comprehensive spectral energy distribution fitting analysis, based on optical to near-infrared data. After excluding possible contaminants, like brown dwarfs, little red dots, high-z (z>8.5) and ultra-high-z (z>15) galaxies, the sample mainly includes sources at z<1, with a tail extending up to z=7.2. The sample has a median stellar mass of $10^7$ Mo and a median dust attenuation of Av=2mag. We analysed the morphology, environment and star-formation rate of these sources to investigate the reason of their large dust attenuation. In particular, HELM sources have sizes (effective radii, Re) similar to non-dusty dwarf galaxies and no correlation is visible between the axis ratios (b/a) and the dust attenuation. This findings indicate that it is unlikely that the large dust attenuation is due to projection effects, but a prolate or a disk-on oblate geometry are still possible, at least for a subsample of the sources. We have found that the distribution of HELM sources is slightly skewed toward more clustered environments than non-dusty dwarfs and tend to be slightly less star forming. This finding, if confirmed by spectroscopic follow-up, indicates that HELM sources could be going through some environmental processes, such as galaxy interactions.",

Submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The recent discovery of a large population of overmassive black holes (BHs) in the early Universe challenges the validity of the BH-host galaxy coevolution framework. However, the reliability of the estimated BH masses (M$_{BH}$) is being questioned, as these are typically derived using single-epoch (SE) relations calibrated locally. Calibrating SE relations at high redshift would therefore enable more accurate M$_{BH}$ estimates and help identify potential biases. In this work, we release a data-reduction technique for JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations that doubles the effective wavelength coverage, enabling detection of otherwise inaccessible emission. Whenever adjacent dispersers are required, observers should carefully evaluate the tradeoff between integrating longer in the bluer configuration alone versus distributing the exposure time across two dispersers. We apply this pipeline to a sample of 5 quasars at z~2 with M$_{BH}$ independently measured through reverberation mapping (RM). This enables a joint analysis of both H$\\beta$ and H$\\alpha$; the latter lying beyond the nominal wavelength range. We assess the reliability of the most widely adopted SE calibrations, finding that H$\\beta$ yields the closest agreement with RM-based M$_{BH}$ estimates, whereas H$\\alpha$-based estimators exhibit a larger scatter. For the least massive BH in our sample ($M_{BH,RM}$~$10^{7.5}M_\\odot$), which is accreting at a rate close to the Eddington limit ($\\lambda_{Edd}=0.8$), all SE calibrators overestimate M$_{\\rm BH, RM}$ by one order of magnitude. This may indicate a systematic overestimation of M$_{BH}$ for highly accreting BHs at high redshift. Finally, we provide the first high-redshift SE calibration based on H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$. Although a larger sample is needed to reduce the uncertainties, our calibration can already be applied to the newly discovered BH population in the early Universe.",

Their formation is typically attributed to a head-on collision of a massive galaxy with a compact satellite (intruder), triggering density waves that, propagating outward, produce the characteristic ring morphology. Here, we present the discovery and detailed analysis of GS18660, the most distant ring galaxy known to date, at z=3.08, identified in JWST/NIRSpec IFS observations as part of the GA-NIFS programme. This work aims to characterise the physical and dynamical properties of GS18660 and shed light into the formation of its ring. Specifically, we analyse the ionized gas properties, stellar populations, and gas kinematics of the system, and use the observed geometry to constrain the timescale of the collision. Our analysis is based on NIRSpec IFS data, including low-resolution (R~100) spectroscopy covering ~0.2-1.3um rest-frame, and high-resolution (R~2700) spectroscopy covering 0.4-0.8um rest-frame. Multi-wavelength techniques are applied to derive nebular gas conditions and stellar population properties. Gas kinematic analysis reveals that GS18660 exhibits a rotating disk component with an additional radial expansion velocity of ~200 km/s, consistent with a propagating collisional wave. Nebular line diagnostics indicate intense star formation (SFR ~100 Msun/yr) along the ring and in the nucleus. Stellar population analysis shows that the most recent star formation episode, occurring within the last ~50 Myr, predominantly took place in the ring. We also identify a close companion, the intruder galaxy responsible for the collision, moving away with a relative velocity of ~425 km/s. The evidence strongly favours a collisional origin for the ring in GS18660, though the presence of a recently formed bar (and hence a resonance ring) cannot be completely excluded.",

Robertson, Samaneh Shamyati, Marko Shuntov, Can Xu Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) High-redshift ($z > 3$), massive quiescent galaxies (QGs) offer a significant window into early Universe galaxy formation. Previous works have predicted miscellaneous properties for these quiescents, from an overdensity of neighbors to elevated quenched fractions among such neighbors (i.e. galactic conformity). However, due to a scarcity in highly-resolved deep-field observations until recently, these properties have not been closely examined and pose unresolved questions for galaxy evolution. With new photometric-redshift catalogs from JWST data in the COSMOS-Web field, we present the S$\\mathrm{\\hat{O}}$NG sample, comprising 171 photometrically selected massive ($\\geq10^{10}$ M$_\\odot$) QGs with $3\\leq$ $z\\mathrm{_{phot}}$ $<$ 5. We look for low-mass neighbors around our sample and find substantial populations of star-forming galaxies (SFGs), contrasting the conformity effect at low-$z$. Our QGs also exhibit diverse clustering, from having no neighbors to potentially residing in environments no denser than star-forming equivalents, to being accompanied by SFGs with more stellar mass than the QG itself. Using a geometric method, we also report filamentary signals for 4\\% of our sample, suggestive of some QGs' rejuvenation via cold gas accretion. We reapply the analysis on seven spectroscopically confirmed QGs in COSMOS-Web (M$_*$ $\\sim$ $10^9-10^{11}$ M$_\\odot$) and note similar patterns. Lastly, we report on Saigon, the most distant low-mass quiescent galaxy known to date ($z =$ 4.55, M$_*$ $= 1.33 \\times10^9$ M$_\\odot$); this spectroscopically confirmed QG resides in a protocluster candidate with 11 SFGs. These results pave new paths towards understanding QG environment, while also signaling an opportune era to examine their evolution with JWST.",

María Benito, Annaliina Aavik, Giuseppina Battaglia, Salvador Cardona-Barrero, Ele-Liis Evestus, Emma Fernández-Alvar, Sven Põder, Heleri Ramler, Boris Deshev, Elmo Tempel Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The chemical dichotomy in the [$\\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane is a consequence of the complex processes underlying the formation and evolution of disc galaxies such as observed in the stellar Milky Way disc. We determine what can drive an $\\alpha$-bimodality of the disc in a zoom-in hydrodynamical simulated galaxy which has had no major mergers and negligible radial migration. Using a Milky Way-mass galaxy from the FIRE-2 suite of simulations, we analyse gas flows in the disc together with its star formation and merger history, as well as the chemical evolution of the hot corona, to investigate their connection to transitions in the chemo-dynamical structure of the stellar disc and its radial distribution. The simulated galaxy exhibits high and low-$\\alpha$ sequences without having experienced major mergers nor significant radial migration. A high-$\\alpha$ thick disc forms during the early chaotic clustering phase. Afterwards, as the star formation rate declines, a dip in the stellar number density appears, coinciding with the dilution of the galactic corona by a minor merger, which subsequently halts the rise of [Fe/H] in the disc. Later, accreted gas onto the disc from minor mergers, mildly enhances the star formation rate and generates the low-$\\alpha$ sequence in the outer disc, with radial inward flows of this material feeding the low-$\\alpha$ inner disc. Furthermore, we find that even at fixed radii, newly formed stars retain a sizable spread in their chemical abundances, reflecting chemical differences between the in-situ and the infalling gas from which they formed, further indicating that instantaneous gas mixing is invalid. Understanding the chemical evolution of stellar discs requires accounting for their accretion merger history and interaction with the surrounding hot corona, as well as the vertical and radial gas flows that redistribute metals within the disc.",

Nguyen 19 pages, 18 figures, accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Extended radio continuum emission and its linear polarization play a key role in probing large-scale structures of synchrotron and free-free emission in the Milky Way. Despite the existence of many radio continuum surveys, sensitive and high-angular-resolution single-dish surveys of extended radio continuum emission remain scarce. As part of the GLObal view of STAR formation (GLOSTAR) survey, we will also crucially complement the existing data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) by addressing the missing zero-spacing gap. Within the framework of the GLOSTAR Galactic plane survey, we performed large-scale radio continuum imaging observations toward the Galactic plane in the range $-2^{\\circ}< \\ell <60^{\\circ}$ and $|b|<1.1^{\\circ}$, as well as the Cygnus X region with the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope. We present the Effelsberg continuum survey at 4.89GHz and 6.82GHz including linear polarization with angular resolutions of 145$^{\\prime\\prime}$ and 106$^{\\prime\\prime}$, respectively. The survey has been corrected for missing large-scale emission using available low-angular-resolution surveys. Comparison with previous single-dish surveys indicates that our continuum survey represents the highest-quality single-dish data collected to date at this frequency. More than 90\\% of the flux density missed by the VLA D-array data is effectively recovered by the Effelsberg continuum survey. The improved sensitivity and angular resolution of our survey enable reliable mapping of Galactic magnetic field structures, with polarization data that are less affected by depolarization than in previous surveys. The GLOSTAR single-dish continuum data will be released publicly, offering a valuable resource for studying extended objects including HII regions, supernova remnants, diffuse interstellar medium, and Galactic structure.

We determine their dark matter content by applying a dynamical method based on $\\mathrm{H\\,I}$ line widths measured with the curve-of-growth technique, together with inclination corrections inferred from optical images. We build a sample of 2453 gas-rich predominantly late-type galaxies spanning a stellar mass range of $10^{8.7}M_\\odot$ to $10^{11.4}M_\\odot$ by matching them one-to-one with their counterparts from the ALFALFA survey and the TNG100 simulation, ensuring a direct match of stellar mass and $\\mathrm{H\\,I}$ radius. We generate mock images and mock $\\mathrm{H\\,I}$ integrated spectra for TNG100 galaxies, and apply the same dynamical method to both ALFALFA and TNG100 mock galaxies to infer their dark matter masses. Across all stellar mass bins, ALFALFA galaxies exhibit lower median dark matter masses than the mock TNG100 simulation results. In each bin, this offset is driven by a tail of galaxies with comparatively low dark matter content, which becomes more prominent toward higher stellar masses. In the highest mass bin ($M_* > 10^{11} M_\\odot$), late-type ALFALFA galaxies show a median dark matter mass that is 23% lower than that of their counterparts in the TNG100 dark-matter-only simulation, with 32% of ALFALFA galaxies having $M_\\mathrm{DM}(<R_\\mathrm{HI})<10^{11.5} M_\\odot$, compared to 17% in the mock TNG100 sample. These results suggest that a larger fraction of massive late-type galaxies reside in relatively less massive dark matter haloes than predicted by the TNG100 simulation.",

Miller, Maxime Tarrasse Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) JWST offers an unprecedented view of optically dark or faint galaxies (OFGs), previously missed by HST. They are likely massive, heavily dust-obscured star-forming galaxies (SFGs) that substantially contribute to the cosmic SFR density at z > 3. To identify drivers of their high dust attenuation and their role in early universe galaxy evolution, we analyse the stellar morphology of 65 OFGs (from 1892 SFGs at 3<z<4) using NIRCAM/F444W imaging from the PRIMER and CEERS fields. We study correlations between dust attenuation ($A_{v}$) and galaxy properties, like stellar mass, size, and orientation, and compare scaling relations between OFGs and typical SFGs. We find that OFGs are ~8-9 times more massive and ~4 times more dust attenuated than the parent sample. Structurally, OFGs resemble parent SFGs in median $R_e$ and median $\\Sigma_{R_e}$ but may be slightly rounder on average. While $A_v$ strongly correlates with stellar mass, it does not show significant dependence on stellar mass-normalised effective radius and stellar mass surface density, Sérsic index, axis ratio, or SFR surface density. The mass-size and mass-surface density relations place OFGs as a higher-mass extension of SFGs, with no concrete proof of evolutionary differences between them. This suggests that OFGs are heavily dust-obscured primarily due to their high stellar masses, which facilitates dust production and retention, with older stellar populations likely contributing as well. Although some OFGs exhibit high $\\Sigma_\\mathrm{R_e}$ and occupy regions of the mass-size plane similar to quiescent galaxies, the overall sample is not representative of this. Their current structures resemble typical SFGs, with no concrete signs of rapid compaction. Diversity in their physical properties shows that OFGs span a range of evolutionary states with few showing reduced star formation, while most remain actively star-forming.",

In this study, we propose a self-supervised method called contrastive learning to upgrade the unsupervised machine learning (UML) part of the \\texttt{USmorph} framework, aiming to improve the efficiency of feature extraction in this step. The upgraded UML method primarily consists of the following three aspects. (1) We employ a Convolutional Autoencoder to denoise galaxy images and the Adaptive Polar Coordinate Transformation to enhance the model's rotational invariance. (2) A pre-trained dual-encoder convolutional neural network based on ConvNeXt and ViT is used to encode the image data, while contrastive learning is then applied to reduce the dimension of the features. (3) We adopt a Bagging-based clustering model to cluster galaxies with similar features into distinct groups. By carefully dividing the redshift bins, we apply this model to the rest-frame optical images of galaxies in the COSMOS-Web field within the redshift range of $0.5 < z < 6.0$. Compared to the previous algorithm, the improved UML method successfully classifies 73\\% galaxies. Using the GoogleNet algorithm, we classify the morphology of the remaining 27\\% galaxies. To validate the reliability of our updated algorithm, we compared our classification results with other galaxy morphological parameters and found a good consistency with galaxy evolution. Benefiting from its higher efficiency, this updated algorithm is well-suited for application in future China Space Station Telescope missions.",

This improved algorithm significantly enhances galaxy morphology classification efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale sky surveys such as those planned with the China Space Station Telescope (CSST).",

Generalization Efficiency of Unsupervised Strategies and Supervised Learning in Galaxy Morphological Classification Shiwei Zhu, Guanwen Fang, Yao Dai, Chichun Zhou, Yirui Zheng, Jie Song, Shiying Lu, Xu Kong Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We conduct a systematic robustness analysis of the hybrid machine learning framework \\texttt{USmorph}, which integrates unsupervised and supervised learning for galaxy morphological classification. Although \\texttt{USmorph} has already been applied to nearly 100,000 $I$-band galaxy images in the COSMOS field ($0.2 < z < 1.2$, $I_{\\mathrm{mag}} < 25$), the stability of its core modules has not been quantitatively assessed. Our tests show that the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) achieves the best performance in preserving structural information when adopting an intermediate network depth, $5\\times5$ convolutional kernels, and a 40-dimensional latent representation. The adaptive polar coordinate transform (APCT) effectively enhances rotational invariance and improves the robustness of downstream tasks. In the unsupervised stage, a bagging clustering number of $K=50$ provides the optimal trade-off between classification granularity and labeling efficiency. For supervised learning, we employ GoogLeNet, which exhibits stable performance without overfitting. We validate the reliability of the final classifications through two independent tests: (1) the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization reveals clear clustering boundaries in the low-dimensional space; and (2) the morphological classifications are consistent with theoretical expectations of galaxy evolution, with both true and false positives showing unbiased distributions in the parameter space. These results demonstrate the strong robustness of the \\texttt{USmorph} algorithm, providing guidance for its future application to the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) mission.",

Probst, Wolfram Kollatschny Accepted for publication in A&A; 5 pages, 3 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Reverberation mapping (RM) is a powerful tool to determine the extent, structure, and kinematics of the broad-line region (BLR) of active galactic nuclei (AGN). So far, RM of the BLR has only been performed for recombination lines responding to the varying ionizing continuum. We tested whether OI 8446, attributed to Bowen fluorescence driven by Ly$\\beta$ pumping, varied on short (day- to week-long) timescales during a 2016 HST/STIS campaign of NGC 4593, and examined how it relates to other emission lines and the ionizing UV continuum. We quantified the variability of OI 8446 by calculating its rms amplitude. We then extracted integrated light curves of OI 8446 and other UV and optical emission lines, and compared them with each other and with the UV continuum light curve using correlation analyses. In addition, we used archival near-infrared spectra to assess the dominant excitation mechanism of OI 8446. We detect, for the first time, variability in OI 8446 on day timescales. The fractional rms amplitude is $\\sim 4$% over the 4-week campaign. The OI 8446 light curve reverberates with a delay of $\\sim 2.5$ days relative to Ly$\\alpha$, used as a proxy for Ly$\\beta$, detected at a false-alarm probability of 0.6% (significance of $\\sim 2.8\\sigma$) under our adopted null hypothesis. It closely tracks H$\\alpha$ with only a minor additional delay of $\\sim0.3$ days, placing its emission region at essentially the same distance as the Balmer-line weighted BLR. Line ratios indicate that Ly$\\beta$ pumping is the dominant excitation mechanism for O I 8446. Our results establish OI 8446 as the first Bowen-fluorescence line reverberation-mapped, responding directly to variations in Ly$\\beta$ flux. We propose that in future campaigns targeting AGN with larger BLRs, O I could enable dual-driver RM using both the continuum and the pumping line as drivers.",

Lugo-Aranda, Justus Neumann, Camila de Sá-Freitas, Patricia Sánchez-Blázquez 2026, Volume 545, Issue 1, 23 pp Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) In this study we perform a comparative analysis of the properties of the HII regions located in different areas of barred galaxies, with the aim of investigating the impact of bars on the physical properties of the ionised gas. Based on integral field spectroscopy data for 17 barred galaxies covering approximately the central 6x6 kpc, we detect a total of 2200 HII regions, of which 331 are located within the nuclear disc (also known as circumnuclear regions), 661 in the bar region, and 1208 in the disc. Among the physical properties of the HII regions, we explore the O/H and N/O abundances, H$\\alpha$ luminosity, dust extinction, electron density, and H$\\alpha$ equivalent width. We find clear differences in the properties of the HII regions between the nuclear disc, the bar and the disc, that could be explained by an enhancement in the molecular gas concentration in the central parts driven by bar-induced gas flows. As this gas is channelled towards the galaxy centre, the most extreme values in the analysed properties are found for the circumnuclear HII regions. Unlike the bar strength, galaxy mass does seem to affect the properties of the HII regions, with massive galaxies presenting higher values in most of the properties, possibly due to the increased amount of gas in these systems. This study provides evidence that the bar-driven redistribution of material within the galaxy inner parts causes significant differences in the HII region properties depending on their location within the galaxies.",

Magrini To appear in the proceedings of the Brazilian Astronomical Society Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) As stars traverse the Milky Way, their orbits evolve through perturbations that alter their orbital radii. These changes arise from two mechanisms: churning, which modifies angular momentum, and blurring, which induces eccentric orbits without major angular momentum change. To assess whether churning or blurring dominates the dynamical evolution of Gaia-ESO stars, we refine Galactic chemical-evolution models by constructing finer grids that span a wider age range. Using a generalised additive model (GAM), we estimate stellar birth radii beyond the limits of binned metallicity models and compare them with dynamical parameters derived from Gaia parallaxes and proper motions, and Galpy. Our metallicity-stratified sample, grouped through hierarchical clustering of 21 chemical abundances, reveals clear migratory signatures: metal-rich stars formed in the inner disc preferentially move outwards, while more metal-poor stars formed at larger radii tend to migrate inwards. About 75% of stars show signs of churning, while the remainder are largely undisturbed or shaped by blurring. These patterns vary among chemical groups, likely reflecting interactions with the Galactic bar and spiral arms.",

However, while Gaia has expanded the scope of white dwarf astrophysics, it has also exposed new questions related to atmospheric composition, spectral evolution, crystallization, magnetism, and merger-driven pathways. Many of these open problems are encoded in the detailed morphology of the Gaia HR diagram, where precise spectroscopic characterization is essential for interpreting the underlying physical processes. Spectroscopic characterization, obtainable with current and future ESO facilities, can provide the effective temperatures and surface gravities that are required to derive accurate white dwarf masses, cooling ages, and luminosities. These fundamental parameters not only enable studies of spectral evolution, interior physics, and the origin of magnetic and high-mass white dwarfs, but also guarantee the construction of robust mass distributions and luminosity functions, essential for constraining the initial-to-final mass relation, probing the initial mass function, and reconstructing the star formation history of the local Galaxy, among other applications. Looking toward the 2040s, future multi-fiber spectrographs operating in survey mode on 10--15 meter class telescopes will be able to collect a complete spectroscopic sample of white dwarf, enabling the detailed characterization of their population. Achieving spectroscopic completeness for the nearby Galactic population and securing high signal-to-noise, moderate-to-high resolution spectra across the HR diagram with ESO instrumentation will be critical steps toward resolving these longstanding questions in white dwarf astrophysics.",

Consequently, age-dependent relations - such as the age-metallicity and age-velocity dispersion relations of the Milky Way, or the age-rotation-activity relation of low-mass stars - are subject to potentially large uncertainties, despite the well-defined trends observed at the population level. White dwarfs, the most common stellar remnants, follow a relatively simple and well-understood cooling process. When found in wide binary systems with main-sequence companions, they can therefore provide the much-needed precise age estimates. The total age of such systems depends not only on the white dwarf cooling time but also on the lifetime of the main-sequence progenitor. Estimating this lifetime requires knowledge of the progenitor mass, which is typically inferred by adopting an initial-to-final mass relation. However, the observational constraints on this relation are still poorly defined, introducing a source of uncertainty in white dwarf age determinations. To mitigate this issue, we focus on a large sample of massive white dwarfs (>~0.7 Msun), for which the main-sequence progenitor lifetime is negligible. These white dwarfs are intrinsically faint and therefore require specialized facilities for adequate follow-up observations. In this white paper, we outline the instrumentation requirements needed to observe the forthcoming population of massive white dwarfs in our Galaxy.",

Thomas, E. Villaver White Paper submitted to \"ESO Expanding Horizons: Transforming Astronomy in the 2040s\" Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) This white paper highlights how stellar population gradients, chemical abundance patterns, stellar initial mass function (IMF) variations, and structural signatures in early-type galaxies (ETGs), measured at faint and large galactocentric radii, out to $\\sim4R_e$, provide powerful diagnostics of their formation and evolutionary histories. These observables encode the combined effects of early dissipative star formation, subsequent accretion and mergers, and internal feedback processes. Achieving such measurements requires high-signal-to-noise, spatially resolved U-band--optical--near-IR spectroscopy at large radii, with enough spatial resolution to study the variation of these properties on $\\sim$kpc scales. These capabilities can only be delivered by a 30\\,m-class telescope. Disentangling these internal processes from environmental influences further demands observations of galaxies across clusters spanning a wide range of evolutionary stages and local environments. The nearby Virgo, Perseus, and Coma clusters, without any comparable nearby counterparts in the Southern Hemisphere, offer ideal laboratories for this work. Such observations will place stringent constraints on the formation mechanism of ETGs, connecting local cluster ETGs to their high-redshift progenitors. This white paper outlines several key science cases enabled by such a facility: (1) mapping stellar population gradients across environments; (2) tracing IMF variations as a function of evolutionary stage and environment; (3) reconstructing the three-dimensional structure of galaxies through deep integral-field spectroscopy and imaging; and (4) identifying and studying compact and relic systems as progenitors of present-day ETGs.",

An ELT/TMT-like telescope in the Northern Hemisphere is a fundamental and necessary facility to provide multiplexing of observing power, diversity of instrumentation, rapid response, and statistical power required to address the questions and the problems, current and future, unveiled by full sky observatories such as JWST, Euclid, or Roman space telescopes. The Northern ELT/TMT will expedite the study of unique, extreme, rare, transient, and/or high-energy events which will give the most information about fundamental Physics problems in the era of multi-messenger and time-domain Astronomy.",

Despite their importance, detailed spectroscopic constraints on the faintest dwarfs are currently limited to a handful of systems in the Local Volume, leaving the role of large-scale environment essentially unexplored at ultra-low stellar masses. A northern 30-40m class telescope equipped with a multiplexed optical integral-field spectrograph will enable a systematic, spatially resolved spectroscopic census of dwarf galaxies with $M_\\star \\sim 10^{5}-10^{7} M_\\odot$ across a wide range of environments. A deep survey of the Coma Cluster, combined with targeted observations of dwarfs in clusters, groups, filaments, and low-density regions, will map star formation histories, chemical enrichment, and internal kinematics at unprecedented depth. This program will directly test models of dark-matter physics, early-Universe feedback, and environmental quenching in the lowest-mass galaxies, establishing dwarf galaxies as precision probes of both galaxy formation and fundamental physics.",

Upcoming surveys will discover vast numbers of new objects, yet their scientific value will depend on follow-up observations requiring far greater sensitivity and resolution than those currently available. A 30-m class telescope like the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) will be transformative, but its Southern location will leave significant regions of the sky poorly covered or even non accessible. A Northern 30-40m telescope is therefore essential to achieve full-sky coverage and fully exploit the small body discoveries of the 2030-2050 era, in particular for targets of opportunity or unexpected discoveries, like those of interstellar objects and potentially hazardous asteroids, as well as for distant trans-Neptunian objects and space mission targets.",

Their small sizes make them difficult to resolve spatially. NSCs often coexist with massive black holes, and both trace the dynamical state and evolution of their host galaxies. Dense stellar environments such as NSCs are also ideal sites for forming intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). To date, spatially resolved NSC properties, crucial for reconstructing dynamical and star-formation histories, have only been obtained for galaxies within 5 Mpc, using the highest-resolution instruments on the current class of very large telescopes. This severely limits spectroscopic studies, and a systematic, unbiased survey has never been accomplished. Because the vast majority of known NSCs are located in the Northern Hemisphere, only a 30-m-class telescope in the North can provide the statistical power needed to study their physical properties and measure the mass of coexisting central black holes. We propose leveraging the capabilities of a 30-m-class Northern telescope to obtain the first comprehensive, spatially resolved survey of NSCs, finally allowing us to unveil their formation pathways and their yet unknown connection with central massive black holes.",

Our interpretation of very high redshift galaxies and transient phenomena depends on knowledge derived from massive star populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, with characteristics that only remotely resemble the conditions in the early Universe. However, the models supporting these interpretations have been tested in a narrow range of environments and carry significant uncertainties when extrapolated. Advancing in our understanding of the Universe beyond the Local Volume therefore requires extending massive star studies to conditions representative of the early Universe. The next generation of telescopes has the potential to accomplish this goal.",

The unprecedented detail obtained for our home system has reshaped our understanding of the assembly of the MW disk, halo, and bulge, and that of its satellites, which now serve as a benchmark for galaxy formation and evolution models.

Yet key questions will remain incompletely resolved: a detailed reconstruction of the Galaxy's assembly from its earliest building blocks, and robust tests of dark matter granularity using the fine structure of the stellar halo and outer disk -- particularly in the Galactic anticenter. Addressing these questions requires high-resolution spectroscopy of faint main-sequence stars (typically 1--2 mag below the turnoff) and turnoff stars ($r \\sim 21$--23) in low-surface-brightness structures: halo streams and shells, ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, the warped and flared outer disk, and anticenter substructures. We argue that addressing this science case requires a 30\\,m-class telescope in the northern hemisphere, equipped with wide-field, highly multiplexed, high-resolution spectroscopic capabilities. Such a facility would enable (i) a Northern Halo Deep Survey of $\\sim 10^{5}$--$10^{6}$ faint main-sequence and turnoff stars out to $\\sim 150$--200\\,kpc, (ii) chemodynamical mapping of dozens of streams to measure perturbations from dark matter subhalos, and (iii) tomographic studies of the anticenter and outer disk to disentangle perturbed disk material from accreted debris. A northern 30\\,m telescope would provide the essential complement to ESO's southern ELT, enabling genuinely all-sky Milky Way archaeology and delivering stringent constraints on the small-scale structure of dark matter.",

Currently available telescopes cannot adequately detect and measure heavy element recombination lines and certain faint collisionally excited lines, which are essential for exploring the effects and biases that potential inhomogeneities in electron temperature and density of the ionized gas may have on determining the chemical composition of these galaxies. On the other hand, the origin of very high-ionization lines (e.g. He II, [Ne V], C IV]) measured in the spectra of an important fraction of these objects remains unknown and a challenge to current stellar models, suggesting the presence of Population III-like stars and/or the existence of non-conventional ionizing sources. Obtaining very deep spectra for a selected sample of local star-forming dwarf galaxies would provide unprecedented constraints on their nature, ionization and true chemical abundances, and could change the metallicity scale we assume to understand the chemical evolution of galaxies over cosmic time.",

García White Paper submitted to \"ESO Expanding Horizons: Transforming Astronomy in the 2040s\" Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) This document discusses the three main lines expected to dominate massive-star research in the 2040s, namely: (1) The role of metallicity in stellar evolution, especially in determining the end products such as gravitational-wave progenitors. (2) The initial mass function from the most massive stars to substellar objects. (3) The role of the environment in the different modes of star formation from compact star clusters to born-this-way associations and from massive clusters to small stellar groups. More specifically, we present the contributions to such science that would be enabled by a 30~m type telescope in the northern hemisphere studying spiral galaxies. Those can be grouped in three: our own Galaxy, the Milky Way; the other two spiral galaxies in the Local Group, M31 and M33; and other galaxies within 25 Mpc, such as M101, M51, and NGC~6946. This work is based on the fact that, as of today, no construction of a 30~m telescope has yet started in the northern hemisphere, so even in the best case scenario of such a hypothetical telescope, its full operation would not start until the late 2030s or early 2040s. It makes no assumptions about its location but supposes an instrumentation development similar to that of ELT.",

Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The FU Orionis star V883 Ori provides a unique opportunity to probe the water snowline in a protoplanetary disk. During an accretion burst, the enhanced stellar luminosity heats the disk, sublimating ices and bringing volatile species into the gas-phase. The water snowline, located at $\\sim$80 au in the midplane, represents a key boundary for dust growth and volatile delivery to forming planets. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 7 observations of V883 Ori that detect two targeted water isotopologue transitions: para-H$_2$$^{18}$O $5_{1,5}$-$4_{2,2}$ at 322 GHz and HDO $3_{3,1}$-$4_{2,2}$ at 335 GHz. After correcting for Keplerian rotation, we detect HDO and H$_2$$^{18}$O at 23.6$\\sigma$ and 9.3$\\sigma$, respectively. Rotational-diagram analysis using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach yields $T_\\mathrm{rot}=116.89\\pm12.81$ K and $N=(4.90\\pm1.69)\\times10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ for H$_2$$^{18}$O, and $T_\\mathrm{rot}=87.46\\pm4.95$ K and $N=(4.47\\pm0.62)\\times10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ for HDO. These results imply water vapor abundances of $N_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}/N_{\\mathrm{H_2}}\\sim3\\times10^{-7}$-$5\\times10^{-6}$ and an HDO/H$_2$O ratio of $(0.4$-$2.0)\\times10^{-3}$ just inside the water snowline, broadly consistent with inheritance from protostellar envelopes. The HDO line in Band 7 is significantly weaker than predicted from Band 6 extrapolation, showing only $\\sim$26% of the expected strength. This attenuation can be explained by a more compact, hotter emitting region with an effective radius of $\\sim$53 au and/or frequency-dependent dust absorption that enlarges the apparent inner cavity at higher frequency. Our results highlight both the diagnostic power of water isotopologue lines and the need for higher angular resolution observations to resolve the water snowline and test these scenarios.",

Stevenson Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The JWST MIRI detector exhibits a flux deficit persistence, but its timescales and impacts remain largely uncharacterized, particularly at the longest imaging wavelengths. In this study, we analyze full-field MIRI imager observations at 21 $\\mu$m (F2100W) to quantify detector persistence following a saturation event by a bright (K = 5.65 mag) nearby (8.12 $\\pm$ 0.04 pc) mid M-dwarf star, IRAS 21500+5903. Unlike typical persistence that appears as excess flux, this effect presents as a flux deficit in pixels previously illuminated by the saturating or near saturating source. We measure persistence at two post-saturation epochs: shortly after saturation (11.6 minutes) and an hour later (1.39 hours). Immediately after the saturation event, we detect a persistence level of $1.69 \\pm 0.10$%. By fitting a Bayesian exponential decay model to the two epochs, we estimate that persistence decreases to one-tenth of its initial value after $5.16^{+1.49}_{-0.94}$ hours. We examine the implications of persistence for MIRI high-contrast imaging using the imager (not coronagraphy). Specifically, we discuss how MIRI detector persistence can produce false-positive exoplanet signals in direct imaging surveys, as well as degrade PSF subtraction, particularly at small inner working angles. We also outline mitigation strategies to avoid these impacts in future observations.",

Prinja, Derck L. Massa, Alex W. Fullerton 17 pages plus 3 appendices. Accepted by MNRAS Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Mass-loss from massive stars is fundamental to stellar and galactic evolution and enrichment of the interstellar medium. Reliable determination of mass-loss rate is dependent upon unravelling details of massive star outflows, including optical depth structure of the stellar wind. That parameter introduces significant uncertainty due to the nearly ubiquitous presence of large-scale optically thick wind structure. We utilize suitable available ultraviolet spectra of 20 Large and Small Magellanic Cloud (LMC, SMC) OB stars to extend existing Galactic results quantifying uncertainty inherent in individual observations to lower metallicity environments. This is achieved by measuring standard deviations of mean optical depths of multiple observations of suitable wind-formed absorption profiles as a proportion of their mean optical depths. We confirm earlier findings that wind structure is prevalent at low metallicities and demonstrate that quantifying the consequent uncertainty is to some extent possible, despite the near-complete absence of time series UV spectroscopic observations in those environments. We find that the uncertainty inherent in any single observation of stellar wind optical depth at low metallicity is of similar magnitude to that already identified at Galactic metallicity (up to 45% for cooler OB stars). We further demonstrate how the effect of varying narrow absorption components in wind-formed UV spectral profiles is unlikely to be properly accounted for in existing mass-loss models. We present further evidence of a binary companion to the SMC O-type giant star AzV 75. The importance of obtaining high cadence multi-epoch, or genuine time series, UV spectroscopic observations at low metallicities is highlighted.",

The JADES Collaboration web site is at this https URL, and data releases are available at this https URL with a viewer at this http URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present an overview of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), an ambitious program of infrared imaging and spectroscopy in the GOODS-S and GOODS-N deep fields, designed to study galaxy evolution from high redshift to cosmic noon. JADES uses about 770 hours of Cycle 1 guaranteed time largely from the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) instrument teams. In GOODS-S, in and around the Hubble Ultra Deep Field and Chandra Deep Field South, JADES produces a deep imaging region of ~42 arcmin^2 with over 100 hrs of exposure time spread over 9 NIRCam filters, including two medium-band filters. This is extended at medium depth in GOODS-S and GOODS-N with NIRCam imaging of ~167 arcmin^2, averaging 25 hrs of exposure over 8-10 filters. In both fields, we conduct extensive NIRSpec multi-object spectroscopy, including 2 deep pointings of 55 hrs exposure time, 14 medium pointings of ~12 hrs, and 15 shallower pointings of ~4 hrs, targeting over 5000 HST and JWST-detected faint sources with 5 low, medium, and high-resolution dispersers covering 0.6-5.3 um. Finally, JADES extends redward via coordinated parallels with the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), featuring ~10 arcmin^2 with 43 hours of exposure at 7.7 um and thrice that area with 1.4-6.8 hours of exposure at 12.8 um and 15 um. For nearly 30 years, the GOODS-S and GOODS-N fields have been developed as the premier deep fields on the sky; JADES is now providing a compelling start on the JWST legacy in these fields.",

Grand, Volker Springel 23 pages, 16 figures, published in MNRAS Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 545, Issue 1, January 2026, staf1551 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We study the formation of chemical sequences in the stellar disc of Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies in a full cosmological context with the auriga simulations. We focus on the conditions giving rise to bi-modal $\\alpha$-chemistry in the MW disc and the potential influence of mergers (e.g. Gaia-Enceladus, GSE). We find a wide diversity of chemical sequences, without correlation between the emergence of dichotomous $\\alpha$-chemistry and GSE-like mergers. The transition between multiple $\\alpha$-sequences is sequential, and is mediated by modulations in the star formation rate (SFR). In some cases, this can be caused by the starburst and subsequent quiescence induced by mergers. In others, by exhaustion or violent disruption of the gas disc. Realisations with singular sequences either lack significant modulations in their SFR, or form too late to have a significant high-$\\alpha$ sequence. The metallicity overlap between the high-$\\alpha$ and low-$\\alpha$ sequences (as seen in the Solar neighbourhood of the MW) arises from accretion of metal-poor gas from the circum-galactic medium. This depends on gas disc thickness, with thinner discs losing their metal-poor extremities. Gas donation from singular gas-rich merger events are incapable of driving long-lived metal dilution ($\\Delta\\text{[Fe/H]} \\gtrsim 0.3$), and we rule-out this scenario for the low-$\\alpha$ sequence in the MW. Finally, the shape of $\\alpha$-sequences in the [Fe/H] versus [Mg/Fe] plane is related to long-term SFR trends, with a downward slanted locus (as is observed in the low-$\\alpha$ sequence of the MW) owing to a sustained or declining SFR.",

Submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Spatially resolved multi-wavelength analysis is essential to study galaxy formation and evolution. A UV-bright galaxy COS-2987030247 at $z = 6.81$ is one of the Rosetta Stones in the epoch of reionization for which JWST NIRSpec Integral Field Spectroscopy, NIRCam imaging, and ALMA data are available thanks to the RIOJA program. We identified the rest-frame optical emission lines from the ionized hydrogen, oxygen, and neon gas. The \\OIII\\,5008Å line emission and the NIRCam images show a complex kinematical and morphological structure where two bright main and three faint clumps are identified in a 10 kpc extent. The system is not classified as a purely rotation-dominated disk. The multiple clumps are instead consistent with a merger-related origin, including either distinct galaxies in interaction or star-forming clumps formed through tidal gas compression during a merger. The spatially resolved emission line fluxes show that dust attenuation, metal enrichment, and ionization parameter are preferentially enhanced in the star formation peaks. Our SED fitting suggests that the main clumps are in a moderately dust-attenuated star forming phase ($A_{\\rm V} = 0.2$--$0.3$ and SFR(H$\\alpha$) $\\sim 10$\\,M$_\\odot$\\,yr$^{-1}$) with almost zero escape fraction of ionizing photons. In contrast, the sub-clumps are dust-free and lying on or below the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. These sub-clumps may work as a perturber that triggers the clumpy starburst in the surrounding gas through the merger event.",

Steinwandel, Amiel Sternberg Accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Observations in the Galaxy and nearby spirals have established that the HI-to-H$_2$ transition at solar metallicity occurs at gas weight of $P_{\\rm DE}/k_B\\approx 10^4 \\ \\rm K \\ cm ^{-3}$, similar to solar neighbourhood conditions. Even so, state-of-the-art models of a self-regulated interstellar medium underproduce the molecular fraction ($R_{\\rm mol} \\equiv M_{{\\rm H}_2}/M_{HI}$) at solar neighbourhood conditions by a factor of $\\approx2-4$. We use the GHOSDT suite of simulations at a mass resolution range of $100-0.25\\ M_{\\odot}$ (effective spatial resolution range of $\\sim 20-0.05\\ \\rm pc$) run for 500 Myr to show how this problem is affected by modeling choices such as the inclusion of photoionizing radiation, assumed supernova energy, numerical resolution, inclusion of magnetic fields, and including a model for sub-grid clumping. We find that $R_{\\rm mol}$ is not converged even at a resolution of 1 $M_{\\odot}$, with $R_{\\rm mol}$ increasing by a factor of 2 when resolution is improved from 10 to $1\\ M_{\\odot}$. Models excluding either photoionization or magnetic fields result in a factor 2 reduction in $R_{\\rm mol}$. The only model that agrees with the observed value of $R_{\\rm mol}$ includes our sub-grid clumping model, which enhances $R_{\\rm mol}$ by a factor of $\\sim3$ compared with our fiducial model. This increases the time-averaged $R_{\\rm mol}$ to $0.25$, in agreement with the Solar circle value, and closer to the observed median value of $0.42$ in regions comparable to the solar neighbourhood in nearby spirals. Our findings show that small-scale clumping in the ISM plays a significant role in H$_2$ formation even in high-resolution numerical simulations.",

Hornekær 9 pages, 9 figures, 1 table, 2 appendix figures. Post peer-review and layout corrections. Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Methylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been hypothesised to be present in the interstellar medium (ISM) through their 3.4 and 6.9 $\\mu$m absorption bands. To investigate the hydrogenation of these methylated PAHs, the simplest, toluene ($\\mathrm{CH_3C_6H_5}$), was exposed to H-atoms. This demonstrated how the presence of a methyl group changes the reactivity towards atomic hydrogen as compared to benzene and other PAHs and how this may alter its chemistry in the ISM. Toluene was deposited onto a graphite surface in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber and then exposed to a H-atom beam. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were used to investigate the reaction between H-atoms and toluene and the masses of hydrogenation products were measured with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS). H-atom exposure of toluene leads to superhydrogenation of toluene and the formation of methyl-cyclohexane ($\\mathrm{CH_3C_6H_{11}}$) at long exposure times. The initial cross-section of H-addition is lower than that of other PAHs. Methyl-cyclohexane can be further hydrogenated, leading to the detachment of the methyl group and production of cyclohexane ($\\mathrm{C_6H_{12}}$) and methane ($\\mathrm{CH_4}$). Toluene may be fully hydrogenated through its interaction with H-atoms, although it has a smaller initial cross-section for H-atom addition compared to other PAHs. This likely reflects it having a smaller geometric cross-section and the low flexibility of the benzene ring when undergoing sp$^3$ hybridization. The removal of the methyl group at high H-atom fluences provides a top down formation route to smaller molecules with the possibility of the formation of a radical cyclohexane combining with other species in an interstellar environment to form prebiotic molecules.",

Oman, Shaun Cole Submitted to The Open Journal of Astrophysics; 15 pages, 13 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We study the prevalence of thin galaxies as a function of stellar mass in the range $10^7 < M_{\\star} / \\rm{M_\\odot} < 10^{11}$ using data from the GAMA, DESI, ALFALFA, and Nearby Galaxy catalogs. We use the distribution of projected axis ratios, $q$, to infer the abundance of intrinsically flat galaxies needed to reproduce the observed abundance of highly elongated systems in projection. We find that as many as $40\\%$ of galaxies in the mass range $10^9<M_{\\star}/\\rm{M_\\odot}<10^{10}$ are intrinsically flatter than $1$:$5$ (i.e., $c/a<0.2$), a fraction that rises to $\\sim 80\\%$ for $c/a<0.3$. Although the incidence of thin galaxies decreases towards lower and higher $M_{\\star}$, they are still quite common in dwarfs: $\\sim 30\\%$ and $\\sim 65\\%$ of $\\sim 10^8 ~ \\rm{M_\\odot}$ galaxies are inferred to be intrinsically flatter than $c/a=0.2$ and $0.3$, respectively. A comparison of these results with several state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations (TNG50, FIREbox, Romulus25) reveals a distinctive lack of thin simulated dwarfs. In particular, there are no $M_{\\star} < 10^9 ~ \\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ simulated galaxies flatter than $c/a=0.2$, in clear contrast with observational samples. This discrepancy likely reflects limitations in resolution and in the treatment of baryonic physics, suggesting that our understanding of the mechanisms regulating the formation of disk galaxies less massive than the Milky Way is still quite incomplete. Our results present a clear challenge to current numerical models of dwarf galaxy formation, which future models should attempt to meet.",

Tallada Crespi Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Estimating stellar masses for billions of galaxies in upcoming surveys requires methods that are both accurate and computationally efficient. We present a new approach using symbolic regression trained on a simulation to derive simple, explicit mathematical expressions that estimate galaxy stellar masses from basic observables: photometry and redshift. Using a mock catalogue from the GALFORM semi-analytical model that reproduces the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS), we show that a linear combination of just four observables -- minimally processed $u$- and $i$- band magnitudes, observed $(g-r)$ colour, and redshift -- can recover stellar masses with accuracy comparable to traditional spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, but with negligible computational cost. Our expressions can be evaluated instantaneously for millions of galaxies, making them ideal for next-generation surveys like LSST and Euclid. When observational errors are included, symbolic regression achieves a similar accuracy to deep neural networks while maintaining transparency. Validation against CIGALE SED fitting on PAUS data shows agreement within 0.13 dex for galaxies with $M_{*} > 10^8 M_{\\odot}$. We demonstrate that the stellar mass function can be recovered at $z < 0.5$, though with distortions at the extremes: the high-mass end is overestimated by a factor of $\\sim 3$ at $10^{11.5} h^{-1} M_{\\odot}$ due to scatter.

Their low metallicities resemble conditions near the peak of cosmic star formation, allowing resolved studies of interstellar medium (ISM) phases, molecular cloud lifecycles, and feedback processes that regulate galaxy evolution. Comprehensive, wide-field spectroscopic mapping of CO and its isotopologues in different transitions, complemented by [CI] observations, and combined with already existing HI and HII surveys, will calibrate star-formation laws and gas-phase partition under low-metallicity conditions and furnish benchmarks for interpreting high-redshift galaxies and cosmological simulations. This science requires a large-aperture, wide-field submillimeter single dish with multi-pixel spectroscopic capabilities, operated from a high, dry site such as Chajnantor, to deliver fast, sensitive, high-resolution, degree-scale mapping with total-power fidelity.

Some measurements were refined and the paper was reorganized Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Emission lines of FeI and NiI are commonly found in the coma of Solar System comets, even at large heliocentric distances. These atoms are most likely released from the surface of the comet's nucleus or from a short-lived parent. These lines were also found in the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov, which has a NiI/FeI abundance ratio similar to that observed in Solar System comets. Here, we report observations of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which were carried out with the ESO Very Large Telescope equipped with the UVES and X-shooter spectrographs. Spectra were obtained at heliocentric distances ranging from 3.14 to 1.85 au. NiI was detected at all epochs. FeI was only detected at heliocentric distances smaller than 2.64 au. We estimated the NiI and FeI production rates by comparing the observed line intensities with those produced by a dedicated fluorescence model. Comet 3I first exhibited extreme and unusual NiI/FeI abundance ratios during the initial stages of its activity. However, as its heliocentric distance decreased, this ratio became indistinguishable from those observed in Solar System comets and in comet 2I/Borisov. Comet 3I was found to be C$_2$-depleted, with a NiI/FeI abundance ratio finally consistent with other C$_2$-depleted comets. Nevertheless, comet 3I remains exceptional due to its high, total production rate of NiI and FeI, which is at least one order of magnitude larger than that of other comets. We interpreted these observations assuming that the NiI and FeI atoms were released through the sublimation of Ni(CO)$_4$ and Fe(CO)$_5$ carbonyls. This scenario provides a straightforward explanation for the asymmetric release of NiI and FeI atoms in the cometary coma and how it depends on the heliocentric distance. It also supports the presence of carbonyls in the cometary material.",

Shaun Bloomfield Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Solar flares are a primary driver of space weather, and forecasting their occurrence remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel flare prediction model based on topologically derived photospheric magnetic parameters. We employ the \\texttt{ARTop} framework to compute the time-dependent input rates of magnetic winding and helicity across more than $10^5$ active region (AR) observations, decomposing them into current-carrying and potential components to reduce sensitivity to optical flow methods. An \\texttt{XGBoost} machine learning model is trained on these topological time series, alongside engineered features including rolling statistics, kurtosis, and flare history, to predict the probability of $\\geq$M1.0-class flares within the next 24 hours. The model demonstrates strong performance on a validation set, with a True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.804 for once daily operational region forecasts. When applied to a fully independent holdout set, the operational forecast achieves a TSS of \\tsssa. A SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis confirms the model's physical interpretability, identifying flare history and accumulated current-carrying winding and helicity as the most important features. The main challenges identified are false positives arising from ARs with frequent C-class flaring and systematic errors introduced by projection effects when ARs are near the limb. Excluding limb-affected data yields no improvement in the holdout set TSS (\\TSSalert\\ versus \\tsssa), due to the overall decreased number of flares. However, our per-region analysis indicates that mitigating these projection effects is crucial for future operational deployment. This work establishes magnetic topology, particularly its current-carrying components, as a highly effective and physically meaningful set of predictors for solar flare forecasting.",

Abdul-Masih 13 (+8) pages, 10 (+9) figures, 4 (+2) tables, accepted for publication in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The majority of massive classical Be stars are thought to be binary interactions products. Their rapid rotation and often strong, variable, and emission-line dominated spectrum, make spectroscopic analysis challenging. Hence, robust binary properties and statistical constraints are still lacking for the Be population. In this study, we use seven Be-X-ray binaries, and their orbital periods derived from the X-rays, to investigate the reliability of different spectral lines and numerical methods for the measuring of radial-velocities and orbital period determination of Be stars. We use multi-epoch high-resolution HERMES spectra and compare absorption- and emission-line radial velocities obtained with cross-correlation, line-profile fitting, and the bisector method. Line-profile variability affects the bisector method and line-profile fitting requires model templates that do not encompass the complexity of Be-star line profiles. Therefore, we recommend using cross-correlation: it is independent of models and easily compatible with line blends seen in Be-star spectra. The obtained statistical uncertainty on the radial-velocities from cross-correlation is 0.2-0.3km/s for H$\\alpha$ (emission) and ~5km/s for absorption lines, excluding potential systematics. In general, whether the goal is to do binary statistics of a population or an in-depth study of a specific system, we suggest using emission lines, due to a higher precision and less scatter than absorption lines. Here, H$\\beta$ is preferred over H$\\alpha$ because of its lesser variability. However, large-scale variability may cause large shifts in emission-line radial velocities, resulting in spurious eccentricities. In this case, orbital solutions should ideally be compared to lower-signal absorption lines (if present). Finally, we highlight the need for understanding how companion-disc interactions alter emission-line appearance.",

Qi Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Rotation is a prominent feature of the Sun, and it plays a crucial role in the generation and dynamic evolution of solar magnetic fields. The daily composite time series of Ca II K plage areas from 1907 February 1 to 2023 December 31 is used to analyze its periodicity and examine the temporal variation of its rotation period lengths (RPLs) using continuous wavelet transform. Wavelet analysis reveals that over a time span of more than a century, chromospheric rotation exhibits a dominant synodic period of approximately 26.62 days, with complex temporal variations. The long-term trend of chromospheric rotation is well-characterized by a statistically significant quadratic polynomial, showing a gradual deceleration from solar cycles 15 to 19, followed by a gradual acceleration from cycles 19 to 24. The RPLs exhibit a negative correlation between the rotation rate of the chromosphere and solar magnetic activity. Their behavior follows a distinct pattern within a Schwabe cycle: the rotation period progressively lengthens during the initial approximately 3 years, then maintains a relatively long value from year 3 to approximately 7.5, and finally shortens during the declining phase, returning to a minimum near the subsequent solar minimum. The variations of chromospheric RPLs show significant periods of 3.2, 5.7, 7.7, 10.3, and 12.3 years, with cross-correlation analysis pointing to a complex relationship with solar activity. The possible mechanisms for the temporal variation of the chromospheric rotation are discussed.",

Understanding their thermodynamic evolution is crucial for assessing their heat budget and exploring how thermal states relate to their plasma dynamics and geoeffectiveness. We conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis of magnetic ejecta (MEs) over Solar Cycles 23, 24, and the ascending phase of 25. Leveraging a polytropic framework, we characterized the thermal state of ME based on the event-wise median proton polytropic index (Gamma_p) from in-situ measurements at 1 AU. We find that MEs are thermodynamically active and rarely evolve adiabatically or isothermally. Notably, a significant fraction (45%) of MEs exhibit a heating state. Heating MEs dominate near solar maxima and exhibit strong solar-cycle modulation in Gamma_p, proton temperature, and expansion speed, indicating active in-transit heating processes. Whereas, Cooling MEs show a nearly constant Gamma_p = 2 across cycles, suggesting enhanced cooling beyond adiabatic expectations and possible thermal energy retention from eruption to 1 AU. Notably, the median Gamma_p value increases from 1.49 (SC23) to 1.88 (SC24), indicating a shift to cooling-dominated states over successive cycles. High-impact ICMEs, predominantly Heating MEs (Gamma_p = 0.59), often manifest as magnetic clouds with enhanced magnetic fields, low plasma beta, pronounced sheath compression, elevated expansion, and post-ICME high-speed flows, making them the most geoeffective drivers of strong geomagnetic storms. These results establish Gamma_p as a useful diagnostic of ICME thermal states, though meaningful assessment of geoeffectiveness requires combined consideration of thermal, plasma, and magnetic field properties.",

However, the length change of the reconnecting structures has rarely been reported. To identify the evolution of the topological structures, we search for reconnection events which should satisfy 3 criteria. (1) Each event displays an explicit X-type configuration, and the configuration consists of two sets of independent atmospheric structures, (2) the reconnection process is clearly observed, and (3) the topological connectivity of the structures can be tracked from at least 5 minutes prior to the occurrence of magnetic reconnection to 5 minutes after the reconnection. In this work, 3 events are selected and studied. During the reconnection moment, the total length of the two topological structures in each event shortens suddenly, and the decrements for events 1--3 are 47 Mm, 3.7 Mm, and 8.2 Mm, respectively, implying that partial structures vanish observationally during magnetic reconnection process. Several possibilities about the vanishment, e.g. the shrinkage of the reconnecting structures due to magnetic tension, the bizarre change in the third dimension, and magnetic field annihilation, have been discussed.",

The post-main-sequence evolution of massive stars remains poorly understood, particularly for blue supergiants. These objects play a crucial role in the dynamical and chemical evolution of galaxies and exhibit pronounced photometric and spectroscopic variability, often quasi-periodic rather than strictly periodic. Aims. We investigate the variability of the evolved B-type star rho Leo to determine its physical properties, identify the underlying mechanisms driving its variability, and constrain its evolutionary stage. Methods. We analyse long-term spectroscopic and photometric datasets obtained from multiple sources, including the TESS and Kepler space missions and observations with the 1.5 m telescope in Estonia. Period analysis is performed using the Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram, Lomb-Scargle pre-whitening, and the Weighted Wavelet Z-Transform. Fundamental stellar parameters are derived by fitting synthetic line profiles computed with the FastWind code to the HARPS spectrum, while the stellar rotation inclination is estimated using the ZPEKTR code. Results. The He I 6678.151 A line shows significant radial-velocity and line-profile moment variations. We detect a set of periods and harmonics spanning approximately 0.8 to 35 days. Some periods remain stable over time, whereas others vary between observing seasons. A comparison of spectroscopic and photometric variability, together with phase-curve morphology, allows us to constrain the origin of several signals. In particular, the approximately 11 day period is attributed to stellar rotation, while the approximately 17 day period is linked to radial pulsations. Conclusions. Although the variability is quasi-periodic, most detected periods persist across multiple seasons. The wide range of timescales suggests that rho Leo is likely evolving along a blue loop following the red supergiant phase.",

In order to determine stellar luminosities and radii, it is necessary to know the total bolometric fluxes emitted by the stars, or equivalently the bolometric corrections (BCs) as accurately as possible. Aims. The aim of this paper is to present and describe a new database of synthetic stellar magnitudes and bolometric corrections for 752 filters from 78 ground- and space-based instruments calculated using the most recent version of the BOSZ synthetic stellar spectral library. Methods. From the entire grid of the BOSZ theoretical spectra, our synthetic magnitudes in the Vega magnitude system were determined using the corresponding routines of the Python package species. Results. The database spans effective temperatures from 2800 to 16000~K, log g from $-0.5$ to 5.5, metallicities from $-2.5$ to 0.75, [$\\alpha$/M] from $-0.25$ to 0.5, [C/M] from $-0.75$ to 0.5, and reddening up to $A_V$ = 3.1 mag. Using high-resolution (R = 50000) synthetic spectra allowed us to precisely track the effect of abundances on the bolometric corrections and luminosity of stars. Conclusions. By applying the new bolometric corrections (BCs) to 192\\,000 APOGEE stars we calculated luminosities, and also demonstrated that neglecting carbon can introduce up to $\\pm$0.2\\% errors in luminosity. The new Gothard Observatory Synthetic Stellar Photometry Database may enable more accurate fundamental parameter determinations for large stellar samples using a vast amount of past, present, and upcoming surveys, such as Gaia, LSST, and the Roman Space Telescope.",

However, compared to the frequent occurrence of white-light flares, confirmed stellar CMEs remain extremely rare. Whether such flares are commonly accompanied by CMEs is a key question for solar-stellar comparative studies. Using Sun-as-a-star soft X-ray flare light curves observed by the GOES XRS 1--8~Å channel, we compiled a sample of 1,766 M-class and larger solar flares and extracted features with both deep convolutional neural networks and manual methods. Five machine-learning classifiers were trained to distinguish eruptive from confined flares, with the random forest model achieving the best performance (true skill statistic; TSS = 0.31). This TSS value indicates that the model possesses a moderate ability to discriminate between eruptive and confined flares. Normalized white-light and GOES XRS flare light curves show broadly consistent temporal evolution, reflecting their shared energy-release history and supporting a probabilistic transfer of the model to white-light flare data. We applied the best-performing RF model to 41,405 TESS-detected flares on FGKM-type main-sequence stars, predicting that approximately 47% of events show CME-like morphological characteristics, with the model-implied intrinsic association fraction lying in the range 35%--60%. Intriguingly, the CME occurrence rate decreases with increasing flare energy, indicating that the most energetic flares may be more strongly confined by overlying magnetic fields. These results provide new insight into flare-CME connections in diverse stellar environments and have important implications for assessing the impact of stellar eruptive activity on exoplanetary atmospheres.",

A number of RR Lyrae stars show variable mean magnitudes in the OGLE survey light curves of the Galactic bulge. Hitherto this phenomenon was not studied, as it was generally assumed to be related to problems with the photometry. Aims. We investigate whether the mean magnitude variability of RR Lyrae variables is due to genuine astrophysical phenomena. Methods. We make use of the extended, and in many cases overlapping, light curves from multiple microlensing surveys, to study RR Lyrae stars with apparent mean-magnitude variations. A modified Fourier-series based fitting method is introduced to analyze the light curves showing mean-magnitude variations. Data from infrared surveys are also used to construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Results. 72 stars are presented where the mean-magnitude variations are most probably of genuine astrophysical origin, and not the result of problems with the photometry. The ratio of variation between the V and I bands is compatible with variable extinction by dust in most cases, but no infrared excess is detected in the SEDs. The occurrence rate of the phenomenon, after correcting for selection effects, is $\\sim0.9\\%$ among RR Lyrae variables in the OGLE bulge fields.",

However, when considering flare irradiance enhancements and dynamics such as chromospheric evaporation, potential contributions from erupted material have historically been neglected. We analyse nine eruptive M- and X-class flares from 2024 to early 2025, quantifying the relative contributions of erupted material to irradiance enhancements during the events. SDO/AIA images from four different channels had ribbon and eruption irradiance contributions separated using a semi-automated masking method. The sample-averaged percentages of excess radiated energy by erupted material over the impulsive phase were $10^{+4}_{-4}\\%$, $24^{+14}_{-14}\\%$, $21^{+14}_{-10}\\%$ and $13^{+6}_{-9}\\%$ for the $131\\,$Å, $171\\,$Å, $304\\,$Å and $1600\\,$Å channels, respectively. For three events that were studied in further detail, HXR imaging showed little to no signatures of nonthermal heating within the eruptions. Our results suggest that erupted material can be a significant contributor to UV irradiance enhancements during flares, with possible heating mechanisms including nonthermal particle heating, Ohmic heating, or dissipation of MHD waves. Future work may clarify the heating mechanism and evaluate the impact of eruptions on spectral variability, particularly in Sun-as-a-star and stellar flare observations.",

While current facilities have revealed the diversity of mature exoplanets and the complex structures of disks, we still lack the crucial observational link between them: a statistically meaningful census of planets caught in the act of formation. This white paper argues that such a breakthrough requires access to the nearest and most informative star-forming regions, roughly half of which are poorly accessible or entirely unreachable from Cerro Armazones. Although the ELT alone will strongly impact our knowledge of planet formation, its location prevents Europe from fully exploiting the necessary parameter space. A 30-40 m telescope in the northern hemisphere is therefore essential for obtaining diffraction-limited imaging of protoplanets and disks across the entire sky, enabling robust demographics, exploiting synergies with ngVLA, Gaia, and other facilities covering the north, and ensuring that Europe remains at the forefront of the planet-formation revolution in the coming decades.",

Bowman, Conny Aerts, Jasmine Vrancken ESO White paper call Expanding Horizons (4 pages) Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Space-based photometry has substantially increased the number of pulsating stars found in binary systems by more than four orders of magnitude. Combined with high-resolution spectroscopy, high-precision photometry offers model-independent constraints on stellar parameters and internal processes. The advent of space-based photometric surveys has given us access to populations of tidally perturbed pulsators, which offer a unique and demanding set of constraints on tidal physics and stellar interiors. However, we lack the ability to undertake multi-epoch, high-resolution spectroscopy at large scale. The ability to obtain phase-resolved, high-resolution spectra would allow us to place precise, model-independent constraints on the stellar properties of pulsators in binary systems that will truly test our close binary asteroseismic modelling techniques, leading to much-needed constraints on fundamental stellar and binary physics. The need to properly cover the large parameter-space of binary stars demands a large-scale, population-level analysis in order to understand the complex landscape of binary stellar evolution. To enable this population-level analysis, we need a dedicated multi-fibre spectrograph (30--200 fibres) with high spectral resolution ($R\\geq 50000$), high signal-to-noise ratio ($\\mathrm{S/N\\geq 300}$), and a limiting magnitude of approximately 15. Such a spectrograph would be capable of efficiently resolving the pulsation variability on the order of minutes and orbit motion on the order of days to years for many targets.",

By systematically varying impact velocity, angle, and mass ratio, we characterize the dependence of collision outcomes on geometric and energetic parameters. A new analytic model is developed using characteristic energies -- particularly the energy deposited in overlapping regions of the colliding bodies -- to accurately describe the mass of the largest and second-largest remnants. The model successfully reproduces simulation results across a broad range of impact conditions and improves on previous models by better capturing the transitions between ``merging'', ``hit-and-run'', and disruption. We also derive outcome formulas averaged over impact-parameter-weighted angular distributions, enabling more realistic applications to integrated modeling of planet formation. The model further shows consistency with outcomes from dust aggregate collision simulations, highlighting its utility for modeling collisional processes not only for large planetesimals but also for smaller bodies.",

Vanrespaille White paper in response to ESO call Expanding Horizons (4 pages) Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The polarization of light is a critically under-utilized, rich source of information in astronomy. For stars in particular, surface magnetism polarization that can be detected and measured with spectro-polarimetry. Many questions about these surface fields remain unanswered due to a lack of dedicated instruments capable of probing weak and strong surface magnetic fields for the entire mass range of stars, from M-dwarfs (and even substellar objects) to massive O-type stars at different evolutionary stages and metallicities. These questions range from the origin of these fields to their true incidence rate throughout the stellar population and the dependence on metallicity. Magnetic fields, although currently often excluded from stellar evolution models, play an important role in stellar evolution. Connecting the surface fields to internal fields through asteroseismology will instigate a new era of understanding stellar evolution and the transport of angular momentum and chemical elements throughout stellar interiors, also impacting our understanding of star-planet interactions and stellar remnants. Polarimetry is also an under-utilized tool to observationally constrain the mode identification of nonradial oscillations, which lies at the basis of accurate asteroseismic parameter estimation at percentage-level for stellar radii, masses, ages, internal rotation, and magnetic field strengths. Combining strong constraints on mode identification and surface magnetic properties through the acquisition of time-resolved, high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise (S/N) spectro-polarimetry and spectroscopy promises to bring leaps forward in our understanding of stellar structure, particularly when combined with long-term space photometric data from past, current, and future missions.",

Currie, Matthew K. Browning Accepted for publication in ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn) The bulk properties of convection in stellar and giant planet interiors are often assumed to be independent of the molecular diffusivities, which are very small. By contrast, simulations of this process in rotating, spherical shells, which are typically driven by conductive boundary heat fluxes, generally yield results that depend on the diffusivity. This makes it challenging to extrapolate these simulation results to real objects. However, laboratory models and Cartesian-box simulations suggest that diffusion-free dynamics are more readily obtained if convection is driven using prescribed internal heating and cooling instead of boundary fluxes. Here, we apply this methodology to simulations of Boussinesq, hydrodynamic rotating spherical shell convection. We find that this set-up unambiguously yields diffusion-free behaviour for some bulk properties of the convection, such as the radial temperature contrast and the convective heat transport. Moreover, the transition from prograde to retrograde equatorial zonal flow is diffusion-free and only depends on the convective Rossby number. The diffusivity dependence of other bulk properties is regime-dependent. In simulations that are rotationally constrained, the convective velocities, and the strength and structure of the zonal flow, are diffusion-dependent, although the zonal flow appears to approach a diffusion-free state for sufficiently high supercriticality. In simulations that are uninfluenced by rotation, or are only influenced by rotation at large scales, diffusion-free convective velocities and zonal flows are obtained. The result that many aspects of our idealised simulations are diffusion-free has promising implications for the development of realistic stellar and giant planet convection models that can access diffusion-free regimes.",

Bugnet under review in A&A, 21 pages, 11 figures Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Dipolar (l=1) mixed modes revealed surprisingly weak differential rotation between the core and the envelope of evolved solar-like stars. Quadrupolar (l=2) mixed modes also contain information on the internal dynamics, but are very rarely characterised due to their low amplitude and the challenging identification of adjacent or overlapping rotationally split multiplets affected by near-degeneracy effects. We aim to extend broadly used asymptotic seismic diagnostics beyond l=1 mixed modes by developing an analogue asymptotic description of l=2 mixed modes, explicitly accounting for near-degeneracy effects that distort their rotational multiplets. We derive a new asymptotic formulation of near-degenerate mixed l=2 modes that describes off-diagonal terms representing the interaction between modes of adjacent radial orders. We implement the formalism within a global Bayesian mode-fitting framework, for a direct fit of all l=0,1,2 modes in the power spectrum density. We are able to asymptotically model the asymmetric rotational splitting present in various radial orders of l=2 modes observed in young red giant stars without the need for any numerical stellar modelling. Applied to the Kepler target KIC 7341231, our formalism yields core and envelope rotation rates consistent with previous numerical modelling, while providing improved constraints from the global and model-independent approach. We also characterise the new target KIC 8179973, measuring its rotation rate and mixed-mode parameters for the first time. The global fit allows for much better precision than standard methods, yielding better constraints for rotation inversions. We place the first observational constraints on the asymptotic l=2 mixed mode parameters (DPi_2,q_2,eps_g2), paving the way towards the use of asymptotic seismology beyond l=1 mixed modes.",

We report a comprehensive environmental characterisation of the Bedretto tunnel in Ticino, Switzerland, a site offering horizontal access, excellent infrastructure, and the potential to be be Europe's second-deepest and quietest underground laboratory. At the prospective physics site, located beneath an overburden exceeding 1400 m, we measure the cosmic-muon, gamma-ray, and neutron fluxes, as well as the radon concentration, magnetic-field spectrum, and seismic backgrounds. The muon flux is suppressed by six orders of magnitude relative to the surface, consistent with an effective depth of about 4000 metre water equivalent, gamma-ray and neutron measurements reflect the local geology and guide shielding requirements for future particle and nuclear physics experiments. Magnetic and seismic noise levels are found to be exceptionally low, meeting or exceeding the criteria for next-generation atom-interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. These results establish the site as a highly competitive, accessible deep-underground location for fundamental-physics experiments.",

Accurate calibration of the receiver response, sampling the full range of possible neutrino geometries, is necessary to estimate the energy and incoming direction of the incident neutrino. Herein, we detail the design and performance of a custom radio-frequency calibration transmitter, consisting of a battery-powered, kiloVolt-scale signal generator (`IDL' pulser) driving an antenna (South Pole UNiversity of Kansas antenna, or `SPUNK') capable of operating at pressures of 200 atmospheres. Performance was validated by lowering the transmitter into a borehole at the South Pole to a depth of 1740 m, yielding high Signal-to-Noise ratio signals at a distance of 5 km from the source.",

Klein Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics 17 pages, 19 figures Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The thermal emission at sub-millimeter wavelengths carries unique information in many astronomical applications ranging from disks and planet formation around young stars, to galaxy evolution studies at cosmological distances. Advancing on the mapping speed to detect this faint emission in ground-based astronomy has been a technical challenge for decades. The APEX Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (AMKID) camera was designed to accomplish this task. The instrument is a wide field-of-view camera based on kinetic inductance detectors. It is installed on the 12~meter APEX telescope in Chile at 5.100~meters above see level. The instrument operates dual color, covering simultaneously the 350~GHz and 850~GHz atmospheric windows. It has a large field-of-view of 15.3'x15.3', and an unprecedented number of pixels: 13.952~detectors in the high frequency band and 3.520~detectors in the low frequency band. Here we present a complete description of the instrument design and construction together with results of the successful low frequency array (LFA) commissioning campaign executed during the last year. The LFA performance is in good agreement with design parameters, with detector sensitivity of 2.2~mK$\\sqrt{s}$ and diffraction limited beam sizes of 17.0''. On-sky measurements demonstrate a sensitivity of 70-90~mJy$\\sqrt{s}$ per detector when operating under good atmospheric conditions (PWV below 1.0mm). With this performance the LFA regularly achieve a mapping sensitivity of 25~mJy when mapping a square degree in an hour. AMKID on APEX with its dual color observing capabilities, high sensitivity, large field-of-view and high angular resolution holds the promise to open a new range of science with the APEX telescope.",

Vergani A similar version of this white paper was submitted to the ESO Expanding Horizons call for white papers Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Time-domain astronomy is entering an era of unprecedented discovery driven by wide-field, high-cadence surveys such as LSST, Roman, Euclid, SKA, and PLATO. While some of these facilities will generate enormous photometric alert streams, the physical interpretation of variability and transients often requires spectroscopy, which encodes changes in ionisation state, kinematics, and accretion that are inaccessible to photometry alone. A critical gap is therefore emerging: next-generation surveys may produce up to $\\sim10^9$ alerts per year, whereas global spectroscopic follow-up is limited to only $\\sim10^4$--$10^5$ transient spectra annually. We present the concept of spectroscopic alerts: real-time notifications triggered by significant spectral evolution, enabling spectroscopy to act as a discovery channel rather than solely as follow-up. We outline the key science cases enabled by this capability and describe the instrumental and operational requirements of a wide-field, highly multiplexed spectroscopic facility capable of delivering real-time spectral discovery for 2040s time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy.",

Remijan, Kin Long Kelvin Lee Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) High-dimensional astronomical data cubes provide a wealth of spectral and structural information that can be used to study astrophysical and chemical processes. The complexity and sheer size of these datasets pose significant challenges in their efficient analysis, visualization, and interpretation. In specific astronomical use cases, a number of dimensionality reduction techniques, including traditional linear (e.g. principal component analysis) and modern nonlinear methods (e.g. convolutional autoencoders) have been used to tackle this high-dimensional problem. In this study, we assess the strengths, weaknesses, and nuances of various methods in their ability to capture and preserve astronomically-relevant features at lower dimensions. We provide recommendations to guide users in identifying and incorporating these treatments to their data, and provide insights into the computational scalability of these methods for observatory level data processing. This benchmark study uses publicly available archival ALMA data from a diverse sampling of source morphologies and observing setups to assess the performance and trade-offs between computational cost, image reconstruction accuracy, and scalability. Finally, we discuss the generalizability of these techniques in regard to data segmentation and labeling algorithms and how they can be exploited for advanced data product generation and streamlined archival analysis as we prepare to enter the era of the ALMA Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade.",

Line Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Inferring the properties of transiting exoplanet atmospheres relies on comparing models to spectroscopic observations. Atmosphere models, however, make a range of assumptions, from one-dimensional (1D, varying with altitude) radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) to three-dimensional (3D) general circulation models (GCMs). The goal of this investigation is to determine the causes of differences in dayside thermal emission spectra resulting from 3D-GCMs (using SPARC/MITgcm) and 1D-RCE models (using ScCHIMERA). We conduct a one-to-one comparison of 1D-RCE models and 3D-GCMs with the same outgoing bolometric thermal flux over a grid of equilibrium temperatures, gravities, metallicities, and rotation periods. Each 1D-RCE model assumes heat redistribution in the planet's atmosphere consistent with that in the corresponding 3D-GCM's photosphere. Comparing corresponding models, the dayside average pressure-temperature (PT) structures can be broken into four vertical regions, each influencing wavelength-dependent differences in their spectra. Furthermore, the dayside average 3D-GCM PTs for planets with Teq=1400 K exhibit a temperature inversion, whereas corresponding 1D-RCE models do not. We find that spectral differences between 1D-RCE models and 3D-GCMs with the same parameters decrease for hotter planets because the spectral shapes more closely resemble blackbodies. To a lesser extent, spectral differences increase for planets with longer rotation periods because of smaller day-night temperature contrasts in the photosphere. Finally, we compare spectral differences to realistic observational uncertainties from JWST with the NIRISS SOSS, NIRSpec G395H, and MIRI LRS instrument modes. We find that 1D-RCE models and 3D-GCMs with the same parameters can produce dayside spectral differences larger than JWST's uncertainty, potentially biasing data-model inferences.",

This transition stems from the constraints of the \"gram-scale weight reduction\" bottleneck. However, the mechanisms behind these materials' outstanding \"lightweight performance\" remain at the purely phenomenological level. To address this issue, this paper innovatively proposes a ternary coupled semi-empirical model, with \"proton density\" (rho_p) as the core independent variable (equivalent to electron density), establishing correlations with full absorption threshold (Eth) and proton utilization rate (eta_p). To validate the model's practicality in complex system design, we embedded it into the NSGA-II genetic algorithm (POP=20, MAXGEN=10). Under constraints of 2-5 layer structures with total thickness <=1 cm, the model's predicted optimal solutions showed an average design error of only 6.2%-8.2% compared to Geant4 heavy simulation dose results. This study provides the first quantitative physical explanation of the inherent trade-off between low-Z materials' \"mass savings\" and high-Z materials' \"space savings.\" When rho_p<1 mol cm^-3, materials demonstrate extremely high proton utilization rates (eta_p reaching 60-100 MeV cm^-2 mol^-1), achieving 35%-55% mass savings. Conversely, when rho_p>1 mol cm^-3, although eta_p drops below 30 MeV cm^-2 mol^-1, its exceptionally high full absorption threshold (Eth) enables ultra-thin shielding technology. This work offers a robust, physically interpretable, and scalable design tool for multi-objective optimization of area density, thickness, and dose in deep space missions.",

Gordon, Clara Sousa-Silva Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Cassini's observations of Titan's atmosphere are exemplary benchmarks for exoplanet atmospheric studies owing to (1) their precision and (2) our independent knowledge of Titan. Leveraging these observations, we perform retrievals (i.e., analyses) of Titan's transmission spectrum to investigate the strengths/limitations of exoplanet atmospheric retrievals with a particular focus on the underlying assumptions regarding the molecular species included in the retrieval. We find that multiple hydrocarbons can be ``retrieved'' depending on the selection made ahead of a retrieval. More importantly, we find that the estimates of other parameters such as the abundance of key absorbers like methane can be biased by $\\sim$0.5 dex (by a factor of $\\sim$3) due to such choices. This shows that beyond the possible misidentification of a molecular feature (e.g., current debate surrounding dimethyl sulfide, DMS, in K2-18 b), the implicit molecular detections made pre-retrieval to avoid retrieving for hundreds of molecules at a time can bias a large range of parameters. We thus recommend sensitivity analysis to assess the dependencies of atmospheric inferences on such selections in tandem with complementary information (e.g., chemistry models) to support any pre-retrieval selection. Finally, we introduce an independent path to constrain the dominant atmospheric constituent, even when lacking observable absorption feature (e.g., H$_2$ and N$_2$) through the scale height.",

To assess detection completeness, we conducted $\\sim$72 million injection-recovery tests across $\\sim$26,000 stars with an average of $\\sim$3 sectors of data per star, subdivided into early-type (M0--M2.5), mid-type (M2.5--M4), and late-type (M4 or later) M-dwarfs. Our pipeline demonstrates high sensitivity across all subtypes within the injection bounds. We estimate the occurrence rates of short-period GEMS as a function of stellar mass, and combine our measured rates with those derived for FGK stars, fitting an exponential trend with stellar mass, consistent with core-accretion theory predictions. We find GEMS occurrence rates of $0.118\\% \\pm 0.068\\%$ for early-type M-dwarfs, $0.153\\% \\pm 0.069\\%$ for mid-type, and $0.036\\% \\pm 0.024\\%$ for late-type M-dwarfs, with a mean rate of $0.068\\%\\pm0.024\\%$ across the full sample.

There exists some ambiguity whether magnetodisc scattering or high-latitude Alfvenic acceleration best describes the observed properties of these injection signatures, and also to what extent arcs in the outer emission are related to injections. Many injection signatures are the result of the evolution of dawn storms; there is, however, limited evidence that non-dawn-storm injection signatures are sometimes present in the aurora. We use automatic detection of these discrete features, alongside data from Juno-UVS and in-situ measurements by other Juno instruments, to show that scattering likely accounts for most of the electron precipitation associated with injection signatures. Additionally, there is evidence that injection signatures can be classified into two types: dawn-storm and non-dawn-storm. Arc-like features in the outer emission show very similar properties to traditional blob-like injection signatures and may consist of sequences of injection signatures that have broadened into an arc via energy-dependent electron drift.",

We observe four transits of the hot terrestrial planet TOI-1685 b using JWST's NIRSpec G395H instrument. Combining this with the transit from the previously-observed phase curve of the planet with the same instrument, we perform a detailed analysis to determine the possibility of an atmosphere on TOI-1685 b. From our retrievals, the Bayesian evidence favours a simple flat line model, indicating no evidence for an atmosphere on TOI-1685 b, in line with results from the phase curve analysis. Our results show that hydrogen-dominated atmospheres can be confidently ruled out. For heavier, secondary atmospheres we find a lower limit on the mean molecular weight of ~10, at a significance of ~5 sigma. Pure CO2, SO2, H2O, and CH4 atmospheres, or a mixed secondary atmosphere (CO+CO2+SO2) could explain the data (Delta lnZ < 3). However, pure CH4 atmospheres may be physically unlikely, and the pure H2O and CO2 cases require a high-altitude cloud, which could also be interpreted as a thin cloud-free atmosphere. We discuss the theoretical possibility for different types of atmosphere on this planet, and consider the effects of atmospheric escape and stellar activity on the system. Though we find that TOI-1685 b is likely a bare rock, this study also highlights the challenges of detecting secondary atmospheres on rocky planets with JWST.",

Waite 53 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in JGR:Planets Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Sprawling, turbulent cloud formations dominate the meteorology of Jupiter's mid-to-high latitudes, known as Folded Filamentary Regions (FFRs). A multi-wavelength characterisation by Juno reveals the spatial distribution, vertical structure, and energetics of the FFRs. The cloud tops display multiple lobes of stratiform aerosols, separated by darker, cloud-free lanes, and embedded with smaller eddies and high-altitude cumulus clouds. These cyclonic FFRs are microwave-bright in shallow-sounding wavelengths ($p<5$ bars) and microwave-dark in deep-sounding wavelengths ($p>10$ bars), with the transition potentially associated with the water condensation layer (6-7 bars). Associating microwave contrasts with temperature anomalies, this implies despinning of cyclonic eddies above/below their mid-planes. Despite deep roots (being detectable in wavelengths sounding $\\sim100$ bars), they are ``pancake vortices'' with horizontal extents at least an order of magnitude larger than their depth. In the northern hemisphere, FFRs are most common in cyclonic belts poleward of $40^\\circ$N (all latitudes are planetocentric), particularly a North Polar Filamentary Belt (NPFB) near $66-70^\\circ$N that defines the transition from organised belts/zones to the chaotic polar domain. This distribution explains the high lightning rates from $45-80^\\circ$N, peaking in a belt poleward of $52.3^\\circ$N, which may trace the availability of water for moist convection. Many observed lightning flashes can be associated to specific FFRs containing bright storms, but some FFRs display no activity, suggesting quiescent periods during storm evolution. Analogies to Earth's oceanic eddies suggest that cyclones deform isentropic surfaces at their midplanes, raising deep water-rich layers upwards to promote moist convection, release latent heat, and inject clouds into the upper troposphere.",

Turyshev Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Lunar dust -- the sub-millimeter fraction of the regolith -- controls the optical, thermophysical, electrical, mechanical, and environmental behavior of the Moon's surface. These properties set the performance envelopes of remote-sensing retrievals, regolith geotechnics, volatile cycles, and exploration systems, while also posing operational and biomedical risks. We synthesize Apollo sample analyses and in-situ observations (Surveyor, Lunokhod, Apollo) with contemporary datasets from the LRO Diviner Lunar Radiometer, the LADEE/LDEX exospheric dust measurements, and Chang'e-4 Lunar Penetrating Radar (LPR). We also incorporate 2024-2025 results: Chandrayaan-3 ChaSTE thermophysics at the Vikram lander's site, SCALPSS plume-surface diagnostics from Intuitive Machines Mission 1 (IM-1), and Negative Ions at the Lunar Surface (NILS) detections of a dayside near-surface H$^{-}$ population on Chang'e-6. The review links (i) production and modification processes to (ii) grain-scale physical/chemical/electrical/optical/mechanical properties, then to (iii) mobilization pathways (meteoroid ejecta, electrostatic hopping, rocket-plume entrainment), and finally to (iv) region-specific design ranges across maria, highlands, pyroclastic units, magnetic swirls, and permanently shadowed regions (PSRs). We quantify temperature-illumination dependence across day/night and PSR-equator regimes through a two-channel $k(T,\\rho)$ model and charge-relaxation scaling. We provide closed-form expressions for adhesion-aware lift thresholds and for near-surface (0-3~m) dust transport at apex/hover heights as functions of sheath structure. The result is a design-ready set of relations, figures, and tables that propagate microphysics and composition into engineering parameters for upcoming landed and rover operations.",
