The first is that the tangent group of a curved manifold and the manifold itself do not necessarily have the same dimensions. The second is that both gravitational theories considered here have been formulated in a gauge theoretic way. Here we would like to start by reviewing the gauge theoretic approach of gravities commenting in particular their diffeomorphism invariance. Then we will review the construction of the Conformal Gravity and the Noncommutative (Fuzzy) Gravity using the gauge theoretic framework. Finally based on an extension of the four-dimensional tangent group we will present the Unification of both Gravities with the Internal Interactions. Both unified schemes will be examined further concerning their behaviour in low energies after suitable spontaneous symmetry breakings as well as the possible signals of the related cosmic strings in the gravitational waves.",

      "abstract": "Twisting asymptotically-flat spacetimes Marc Geiller, Pujian Mao, Antoine Vincenti General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We extend the Bondi formalism to describe asymptotically-flat spacetimes where the outgoing null geodesic congruence is not hypersurface-orthogonal, i.e. has a non-vanishing twist. In the Newman-Penrose formulation, the twist $\\text{Im}(\\rho)$ is sourced by a twist potential sitting in the transverse null dyad $(m,\\bar{m})$, while in the metric formulation this potential arises from $g_{ra}\\neq0$. We explain how to arrange and solve the Einstein equations for such generalized line elements, thereby providing an extension of the Bondi hierarchy to asymptotically-flat spacetimes with non-vanishing twist. We work out the twisting generalizations of all the well-known features pertaining to asymptotically-flat spacetimes in Bondi gauge, such as the solution space, the flux-balance laws, the asymptotic symmetries, and the transformation laws. The twist potential has a natural Carrollian interpretation as an Ehresmann connection, and gives rise to Carroll boosts as extra asymptotic symmetries. One of the advantages of the Bondi gauge with non-vanishing twist is that it allows to write algebraically special solutions in a manifestly finite radial expansion, and with a repeated principal null direction such that $\\Psi_0=\\Psi_1=0$. This is in particular the case for the Kerr-Taub-NUT solution. The asymptotic symmetries of algebraically special solutions also have a finite radial expansion, which enables to study the supertranslated Schwarzschild solution and its charges quite straightforwardly. We expect that these results will find applications in the development of flat holography for algebraically special solutions and in the study of their perturbations. We also study an analogue of the twist in three-dimensional spacetimes with non-vanishing cosmological constant, and find an 8-dimensional solution space which encompasses and generalizes the existing results in the literature.",

Teukolsky General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The characteristic decomposition for GRMHD is not known in a form useful for current numerical simulations. This prevents us from using the most accurate known computational methods, such as full-wave Riemann solvers. In this paper, we present a new method of finding decompositions. The method is based on transformations from the comoving frame, where the fluid flow is simplest and the decomposition has been known for a long time. The key innovation we introduce is that of quasi-invertible transformations. In this first paper, we introduce these transformations using the simpler example of relativistic hydrodynamics. We recover the known decomposition for relativistic hydrodynamics in somewhat simpler form than previously derived, and without the need for computer algebra. A new result in this paper is the characteristic decomposition when the the evolution tracks the composition of a fluid in nuclear statistical equilibrium. In Paper II of this series, we apply a quasi-invertible transformation to derive the complete characteristic decomposition for GRMHD in the conserved variables used in simulations.",

We impose the Einstein equations at the horizon and explicitly derive all intrinsic geometries of the extremal horizon, consisting of a two-sphere metric and a rotation 1-form, in the above class. The 2-geometries turn out to be equivalent to the classification of conically singular horizons with product topology. Both the rotating and non-rotating horizons are then embedded in the Plebański-Demiański spacetimes, which naturally admit horizons of this type. Furthermore, we compare our results with previously obtained solutions to the Einstein vacuum extremal horizon equation with cosmological constant and the solution of Petrov type D equation with transversal bundle structure.",

Spieksma, Francisco Duque, Leonardo Gualtieri, Vitor Cardoso General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Black holes in our Universe are rarely truly isolated, being instead embedded in astrophysical environments such as plasma or dark matter. A particularly intriguing possibility is that light scalar fields form bound states around black holes, producing extended ''clouds'' known as gravitational atoms. When these clouds become sufficiently compact, the spacetime can no longer be described by a vacuum solution of General Relativity. In this regime, one can construct quasi-stationary, spherically symmetric, self-gravitating scalar gravitational-atom configurations. Here, we explore an observationally relevant aspect of these systems by computing their fundamental quasi-normal mode. We present a fully relativistic calculation of the axial modes in both the time and frequency domains, finding frequency shifts relative to the vacuum case that depends mostly on the compactness of the gravitational atom. For sufficiently compact configurations, these shifts may be detectable by current or future gravitational wave detectors.",

It includes pivotal observations about renormalizability and the study of some allowed interactions. Beyond these points, since dark-matter phenomenology is mainly connected to gravitation, we introduce original remarks on how the Hermitian prescription can be readily generalized to include curved space-time, considering the very definition of the Elko spinor structure. We establish the Elko dual as arising from the path-integral formulation of a more fundamental structure. It enables one to include a curved background space-time and also quantum gravity into our investigations.",

      "abstract": "Phase Space of SdS Geodesics and using the Cosmological Horizon to Observe a Black Hole Bela Nelson, Allison Powell, Jennie Traschen General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Light propagating from near a black hole horizon to the outside world is highly redshifted. In the limit that the emitter passes through the horizon, the redshift becomes infinite. In this sense the near horizon region is unobservable, as emission energies fall below some detectability bound. However, in Schwarzschild de Sitter (SdS) spacetime there is a second, cosmological, horizon due to the positive cosmological constant. Judiciously placed observers can take advantage of the blueshift due to this horizon. The frequency of signals emitted from near the black hole can be shifted back upward to an observable value. This effect is computed for a variety of accelerated and geodesic observers. An analysis of radial and circular geodesics in SdS is a key component of the paper. We find a ``cresting-wave\" shaped critical curve in the SdS-geodesic parameter space such that under the curve there are three circular orbits, on the curve there are two orbits, and elsewhere there is one. It is found that the best strategy for observing photons from an emitter falling into the black hole is for the receiver to be near the cosmological horizon and also moving towards the black hole. For photons emitted from the smallest circular orbit and received at the largest circular orbit, the nonzero cosmological constant enhances observations by a factor that varies from zero to three.",

Crucially, the solution is exclusively supported by the phantom branch of the DBI action, dynamically replacing the central singularity with a regular core. The solution is asymptotically flat, possesses non-trivial scalar hair, and replaces the central singularity with a regular 2-sphere. The mechanism for singularity resolution is a dynamical kinetic stiffness -- analogous to shear thickening in non-Newtonian fluids -- which also explains the evasion of classical no-hair theorems. We show these black holes evaporate to a stable, non-singular, extremal Planck-scale relic. This provides a robust mechanism to evade standard evaporation constraints, opening a vast, previously forbidden mass window for light Primordial Black Holes to constitute dark matter. The model is testable via distinctive gravitational-wave signatures from its scalar hair.",

Shankaranarayanan 51 pages, 2 figures, accepted in Classical and Quantum Gravity General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) The accelerated expansion of the universe poses a significant challenge to General Relativity. Non-local modifications to gravity have emerged as a compelling class of theories to address this dark energy puzzle. Building upon earlier proposals, we investigate a specific non-local modified gravity action incorporating terms like $R\\Box^{-2}R$, $R^{\\mu\\nu}\\Box^{-2}R_{\\mu\\nu}$, $R^{\\mu\\nu\\sigma\\delta}\\Box^{-2}R_{\\mu\\nu\\sigma\\delta}$ and demonstrate that it provides a dynamical origin for a massive graviton by reducing to the standard and extended Fierz-Pauli action at the linearized level. A fixed-point analysis of the background cosmology reveals a stable de Sitter attractor, ensuring the model naturally drives accelerated expansion. Crucially, we investigate the cosmological perturbations and show that the theory's six propagating degrees of freedom are free from ghost instabilities. We further demonstrate that all large-scale tensor modes are dynamically stable and decay on the accelerating background. This ghost-free massive gravity extension provides distinct predictions for gravitational wave polarizations and is theoretically consistent with $\\mathbf{\\Lambda CDM}$ at late times, positioning it as a unique alternative to scalar-tensor models like $f(R)$ and Galileons. This robust stability at both the background and perturbative levels establishes our model as a consistent and compelling alternative to the standard $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm.",

It reduces to the Schwarzschild metric when gamma = 1. In this paper we explore potential signatures of the gamma-metric on periodic orbits and their gravitational-wave radiation. Periodic orbits are classified by a rotational number specified by three topological numbers (z, w, v), each triple corresponding to characteristic zoom-whirl behavior. We show that deviations from gamma=1 alter the radii and angular momentum of bound orbits and thereby shift the (z, w, v) taxonomy. We also compute representative gravitational waveforms for certain periodic orbits and demonstrate that gamma != 1 can induce phase shifts and amplitude modulations correlated with changes in the zoom-whirl structure. In particular, larger zoom numbers lead to increasingly complex substructures in the waveforms, and finite deviations from gamma=1 can significantly modify these features. Our results indicate that precise measurements of waveform morphology from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals may constrain deviations from spherical symmetry encoded in gamma.",

This work investigates the influence of a cold dark matter (DM) halo on the dynamics of relativistic, low angular momentum, inviscid, and advective hot accretion flow onto a galactic SMBH. Modeling the spacetime geometry as a black hole embedded within various DM distributions, including those with a central density spike, we demonstrate that the presence of a DM halo, particularly one that is massive and compact, enhances the luminosity of the accretion disk. The dominant contribution to this luminosity originates from the inner regions of the flow, suggesting that luminosity measurements could serve as a valuable observational probe for the dense DM environments expected near galactic centers.",

Hinging on the functional similarities between the Ricci-Flow equation and the SQ Langevin equations proposed by Rumpf, we push forward a novel approach characterized by a multiplicative noise and a stochastic time that converges to the proper time of a space-like foliation in the equilibrium limit, where quantities have constant averages. We express the starting system of equations using the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) variables and their conjugated Hamiltonian momenta. Such a choice is instrumental in understanding the newly derived equations in terms of the breakdown of the diffeomorphism invariance of the classical theory, which instead will hold on average at the steady state. We comment on the physical interpretation of the Ricci flow equations, and argue how they can naturally provide, in a geometrical way, the renormalization group equation for gravity theories. In the general setting, the equation associated to the shift vector yields the Navier-Stokes equation with a stochastic source. Moreover, we show that the fluctuations of the metric tensor components around the equilibrium configurations, far away from the horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole, are forced by the Ricci flow to follow the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, whose probabilistic distribution can yield an intermittent statistics. We finally comment on the possible applications of this novel scenario to the cosmological constant, arguing that the Ricci flow may provide a solution to the Hubble tension, as a macroscopic effect of scale dependence of the quantum fluctuations of the metric tensor.",

This complements prior work in \\cite{aly2024nonlinearities} on the second-order gravitational perturbation mixing and highlights potential applications in multi-messenger astrophysics for systems observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) and upcoming LISA. We also study first-order perturbations due to a point charge and show it could be reduced to a one-dimensional path integral. Within the toy model, we investigate the first-order electromagnetic perturbation due to a radially free-falling single charge \\( q \\) and radial dipole moment \\( p = q \\eta \\), employing semi-analytical and numerical methods.

We extend Birkhoff's theorem from general relativity to a broad class of generally covariant gravity theories formulated in the Hamiltonian framework. Conversely, we show that each one-parameter family of static, spherically symmetric spacetimes determines a class of covariant theories, each of which has that family of spacetimes as its entire vacuum solution space. Our systematic and model-independent framework applies to a wide range of spacetimes, including observationally inferred, quantum-gravity-inspired, and regular black holes.

These configurations are intrinsically relativistic, sustained entirely by their rotation, since no compact or finite dust distribution can exist under the same symmetry conditions in Newtonian gravity. In such systems, rotational effects arise from off-diagonal components of the spacetime metric, which are not negligible compared to their Newtonian counterparts.

Phys. J. C 85, 1318 (2025) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The study of circular orbits is fundamental in gravitational physics, yet their definition in dynamical spacetimes remains challenging due to the lack of temporal symmetry. In this work, we establish a unified framework by commencing from the geometrically invariant quasi-local definition of a particle surface. We demonstrate that this definition naturally leads to a set of conditions that can be recast into the language of a coordinate-dependent dynamical potential. This potential serves as a practical computational tool for locating evolving circular orbits within a specific coordinate system. We rigorously prove the equivalence between the quasi-local and dynamical potential approaches in dynamical spherically symmetric spacetimes. The efficacy and self-consistency of the dynamical potential method are explicitly verified through its application to the Oppenheimer-Snyder dust collapse model, where it correctly reproduces the established evolution equations for null and timelike circular orbits. This work bridges the gap between abstract geometric definitions and concrete calculations, providing a robust and adaptable framework for analyzing orbital dynamics in time-dependent gravitational fields.",

Using the static and spherically symmetric Morris-Thorne metric, we derive the field and conservation equations, separating the effective energy-momentum tensor into torsional and massive contributions. We analyze three representative classes of metric redshift functions, namely constant, logarithmic, and power-law forms, and two cases of the massive term, i.e. the general one and the uniform pressure case. The obtained solutions satisfy the flaring-out condition and remain asymptotically flat, while the effective matter sector can fulfill or only mildly violate the standard energy conditions. The results show that the inclusion of a small graviton mass provides an additional anisotropic pressure that can sustain the throat geometry without introducing exotic sources. In the limit of vanishing graviton mass, the configurations continuously reduce to the standard $F(T)$ wormhole solutions, confirming the consistency of the framework.",

The aforementioned systems may all have in common the presence of a distant point mass perturbing in some ways their inner dynamics. That is, respectively, a circumbinary exoplanet whose orbital plane should be perpendicular to that of its host inner binary, an intermediate mass black hole potentially causing the observed jet precession, and a still unseen planet, known as Telisto or Planet Nine, which may, perhaps, have been recently spotted in archival images although in a quite different orbit with respect to that originally expected.

We here propose a novel approach to study turbulence in strong gravitational fields that is based on the computation of structure functions on generic manifolds and is thus applicable to arbitrary curved spacetimes. In particular, we introduce, for the first time, a formalism to compute the characteristic properties of turbulence, such as the second-order structure function or the power spectral density, in terms of proper lengths and volumes and not in terms of coordinate lengths and volumes, as customarily done. By applying the new approach to the turbulent rest-mass density field from simulations of magnetised disc accretion onto a Kerr BH, we inspect in a rigorous way turbulence in regions close to the event horizon, but also in the disc, the wind, and in the jet. We demonstrate that the new approach can capture the typical behavior of an inertial-range cascade and that differences up to $40-80\\%$ emerge in the vicinity of the event horizon with respect to the standard flat-spacetime approach. While these differences become smaller at larger distances, our study highlights that special care needs to be paid when analysing turbulence in strongly curved spacetimes.",

This allows, in principle, for WEC violation (\\(\\Omega<0\\)) when electric and magnetic fields are sufficiently aligned. Phenomenologically, the same operator induces vacuum birefringence. By comparing its predicted effect to laboratory (PVLAS) and astrophysical (magnetar X-ray polarimetry) data, we place stringent constraints on the coupling \\(\\zeta\\). These constraints reveal that the threshold for WEC violation requires field strengths many orders of magnitude beyond any plausible astrophysical values and close to the EFT's breakdown scale.

The massless scalar field is quantized in the Boulware vacuum to isolate curvature-modulated acceleration effects without a thermal Hawking background. Working in a (1+1) radial reduction and using first-order time-dependent perturbation, we evaluate the period-averaged transition rate (or the Floquet transition rate). The resulting particle emission spectrum exhibits a thermal Bose-Einstein-type profile with periodic trajectory yielding a Floquet resonance condition $n\\Omega > \\omega_0$ and a closed-form expression for the Floquet transition rate $\\overline{P}_n$, which reduces to the flat Minkowski spacetime result as $R_0\\to\\infty$, in agreement with Near the horizon, $f(R_0)<1$ enhances the effective Bessel argument by $1/\\sqrt{f(R_0)}$, providing a simple analytic demonstration of curvature/redshift amplification of acceleration radiation.

We discuss the regime of validity (small amplitude, $R_0$ away from the horizon) and outline the extensions to (3+1) dimensions, including density-of-states and greybody factors, and to alternative vacuum choices.

The methods are shown to be equivalent when the condition $M'' S' - S'' M' \\neq 0$ holds, while deviations appear when this relation fails, signaling subtle connections between mass $M(r_h)$, entropy $S(r_h)$, and topological structure, with $r_h$ being the horizon radius. We first verify this equivalence to Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes, recovering known classifications and confirming the consistency of our approach with respect to the validity of the above condition. We then extend the analysis to four-dimensional black strings, regarded as cylindrically symmetric black hole solutions in asymptotically AdS spacetimes. Our results show that both neutral and charged black strings possess the same global topological number, $W = +1$, implying that electric charge does not influence their topological classification. This insensitivity to charge mirrors earlier findings for BTZ black holes in three dimensions, suggesting that it may represent a universal property of cylindrically symmetric black holes in AdS backgrounds.",

While its equivalence to the Iyer--Wald formalism is well understood in pure gravity theories, its validity in matter-coupled theories remains less clear and has even been questioned in the literature. In this work, we revisit this issue and demonstrate that the equivalence between the Euclidean action method and the Iyer--Wald formalism persists in matter-coupled scenarios. We apply the resulting formulation to two representative examples of such theories, and in both cases, the Euclidean approach performs smoothly. We further identify situations where the method may encounter subtleties due to the special properties of certain matter fields. Our results clarify when background subtraction remains reliable beyond pure gravity and when additional care is necessary.",

V2: corrected version with important changes, new references added General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this article, we construct a family of spherically symmetric thin-shell wormholes within scalar-tensor theories of gravity. In the case of wormholes symmetric across the throat, we study the matter content and analyze the stability of the static configurations under radial perturbations. We apply the formalism to a particular example involving Einstein-Maxwell gravity coupled to a conformally invariant scalar field. We show that stable configurations are possible for suitable values of the parameters involved.",

Code and aggregated data are available on Zenodo (see DOI). this https URL General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We investigate the Coherence--Curvature Model (CCM), a dynamical ensemble of connected graphs governed by a Hamiltonian that couples algebraic connectivity, Ollivier-Ricci curvature, and an edge-density penalty. Using connected simulated annealing we generate low-energy graph configurations and characterize their emergent geometry through the spectral dimension (ds), the Hausdorff dimension (dh), and the average distance. Finite-size scaling shows a clear growth of ds with system size, while dh increases more mildly. At the largest volumes explored the data are compatible with ds ~ 4 and dh ~ 3, implying ds > dh and a nontrivial hierarchy between spectral and volumetric notions of dimension. We also map the dependence on the curvature coupling gamma and the locality coupling beta, and we find a slow power-law growth of typical distances with a small exponent eta. The CCM therefore provides a controlled numerical laboratory in which the interplay of coherence, curvature, and locality yields finite-dimensional, fractal-like geometries.",

Within a minimally coupled Einstein--Maxwell system, we derive explicit quadratic electromagnetic source terms for the spin-$-2$ Teukolsky equation, providing a foundation for future numerical studies of GEM interactions in the framework of black-hole spectroscopy. Moreover, we give order-of-magnitude arguments showing that GEM quadratic quasinormal modes (QQNMs) can become relevant in a range of charged and magnetized astrophysical scenarios. Finally, we show through a brief dilaton-theory example that the GEM QQNM spectrum is sensitive to how gravity couples to electromagnetism, thereby providing a model-based way to test minimal coupling and to constrain hidden $U(1)$ sectors with gravitational-wave observations.",

The strategy involves matching the solution for the linearised fluid dynamics in the star's interior to the spacetime perturbations in the near-zone surrounding the body, along with an identification of the tidal driving and the star's response. Notably, this identification is exact in Newtonian gravity and we provide strong evidence that it remains robust also in the relativistic case. The argument does not involve a sum over the star's quasinormal modes and hence circumvents one of the obstacles that have held up the development of models for relativistic tides. Numerical results are provided, at the proof-of-principle level, for a realistic matter equation of state from the BSk family, including composition stratification leading to the presence of low-frequency gravity modes. We also sketch the connection with the field-theory inspired approach to the problem, in which the tidal response is expressed in terms of asymptotic scattering amplitudes.",
