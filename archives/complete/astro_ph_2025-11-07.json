      "abstract": "The First Upper Bound on the Non-Stationary Gravitational Wave Background and its Implication on the High Redshift Binary Black Hole Merger Rate Mohit Raj Sah, Suvodip Mukherjee High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The high redshift merger rate and mass distribution of black hole binaries (BHBs) is a direct probe to distinguish astrophysical black holes (ABHs) and primordial black holes (PBHs), which can be studied using the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background (SGWB). The conventional analyses solely based on the power spectrum are limited in constraining the properties of the underlying source population under the assumption of a non-sporadic Gaussian distribution. However, recent studies have shown that SGWB will be sporadic and non-Gaussian in nature, which will cause non-zero 'spectral correlation' depending on the high redshift merger rate and mass distribution of the compact objects. In this work, we present the first spectral covariance analysis of the SGWB using data from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration during the third and the first part of the fourth observing runs. Our analysis indicates that the current spectral correlation is consistent with non-stationary noise, yielding no detection from the current data and providing only upper bounds between frequencies in the range 25 Hz to 100 Hz. This upper bound on the spectral correlation translates to the upper bounds on the mass-dependent merger rate of PBHs between $2.4\\times10^{4}$ and $2.3\\times10^{2} \\rm ~Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ (at ${\\rm z} = 1 $ ) with a log-normal mass distribution with median masses between $20 ~M_{\\odot}$ and $120 ~M_{\\odot}$. This provides a stringent upper bound on the PBH merger rate at high redshift and hence puts constraints on the PBH formation scenario even in the presence of large spatial clustering. In the future, detection of this signal will lead to direct evidence of the high-redshift black hole population using gravitational waves.",

Böttger, Gergely Dálya Code and posterior plots available at this https URL Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In our local-to-global cosmological framework, cosmic acceleration arises from local dynamics in an inhomogeneous Einstein-de Sitter (iEdS) universe without invoking dark energy. An iEdS universe follows a quasilinear coasting evolution from an Einstein-de Sitter to a Milne state, as an effective negative curvature emerges from growing inhomogeneities without breaking spatial flatness. Acceleration can arise from structure formation amplifying this effect. We test two realizations, iEdS(1) and iEdS(2), with $H_0=\\{70.24,74.00\\}\\ \\mathrm{km\\ s^{-1}\\ Mpc^{-1}}$ and $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{m},0}=\\{0.290,0.261\\}$, against CMB, BAO, and SN Ia data. iEdS(1) fits better than $\\Lambda$CDM and alleviates the $H_0$ tension, whereas iEdS(2) fully resolves it while remaining broadly consistent with the data. Both models yield ${t_0\\simeq13.64\\ \\mathrm{Gyr}}$, consistent with globular-cluster estimates.",

In this framework, dark matter exhibits primordial isocurvature perturbations with an amplitude of ${\\cal O}(1)$ at small scales that are beyond the reach of current observations such as those from the CMB and large-scale structure. We derive an exact transfer function for the dark matter field perturbations during the radiation dominated era. Based on this result, we also derive approximate expressions of the transfer function in some limiting cases where we confirm that the exact transfer function reproduces known behaviors. Assuming a monochromatic initial power spectrum, we use the transfer function to identify the viable parameter space defined by the dark matter mass and the length scale of perturbations. A key prediction of this scenario is copious formation of subsolar mass dark matter halos at high redshifts. Observational confirmation of a large population of such low-mass halos will support for the hypothesis that dark matter originated purely from inflationary quantum fluctuations.",

However, the detection of SL events in wide-field surveys such as Euclid requires robust, automated methods capable of handling the immense data volume generated. In this work, we present an advanced deep learning (DL) framework based on mask region-based convolutional neural networks (Mask R-CNNs), designed to autonomously detect and segment bright, strongly-lensed arcs in Euclid's multi-band imaging of galaxy clusters. The model is trained on a realistic simulated data set of cluster-scale SL events, constructed by injecting mock background sources into Euclidised Hubble Space Telescope images of 10 massive lensing clusters, exploiting their high-precision mass models constructed with extensive spectroscopic data. The network is trained and validated on over 4500 simulated images, and tested on an independent set of 500 simulations, as well as real Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) observations. The trained network achieves high performance in identifying gravitational arcs in the test set, with a precision and recall of 76% and 58%, respectively, processing 2'x2' images in a fraction of a second. When applied to a sample of visually confirmed Euclid Q1 cluster-scale lenses, our model recovers 66% of gravitational arcs above the area threshold used during training. While the model shows promising results, limitations include the production of some false positives and challenges in detecting smaller, fainter arcs. Our results demonstrate the potential of advanced DL computer vision techniques for efficient and scalable arc detection, enabling the automated analysis of SL systems in current and future wide-field surveys.

We suggest it should be, highlighting two appreciable issues. First, astronomical distances are inferred latent parameters, requiring a prior. We show that the common assumption of (perhaps implicit) uniform priors on distance moduli biases distances low due to objects being intrinsically uniformly distributed in volume. At fixed measured redshifts, this biases the Hubble constant high. Second, selection effects introduce additional factors in the posterior. These typically counteract the effect of the volume prior to some extent, but depend significantly on the nature of the selection. Typical assumptions place $H_0$ at the top of the plausible range, corresponding to a redshift-selected sample. After a detailed analytic and mock-based study of these effects, we apply them to the CosmicFlows-4 sample, where introducing the distance prior causes an approximately 12~per cent increase in distances and $>8$ km/s/Mpc (55 statistical $\\sigma$) decrease in the Hubble constant for the case of volume or magnitude selection. Redshift selection would fully undo this shift and is the more likely scenario, as a phenomenological model shows. We also investigate the SH0ES sample, where the volume-prior effect is modest ($1.6\\sigma$) and is likely already accounted for within the SH0ES pipeline. Our work highlights the crucial need to model both the distance prior and selection accurately for robust distance ladders and derived parameters. The latter requires samples with known, homogeneous selection criteria, which should be prioritised in future surveys.",

We quantified the prevalence of PBC-related artifacts in the IllustrisTNG using dark-matter-deprived galaxies (DMDGs) as tracers. We found that their occurrence scales inversely with simulation volume. We demonstrated that this excess population is spatially correlated with the box edges; the smallest TNG50 box is most affected by these problems. This is a unique and irreplaceable resource for studying galaxy structure. Manual inspection confirmed abrupt, unphysical mass-loss events coincident with boundary crossings. We also highlight the challenge of disentangling numerical artifacts from genuine tidally stripped galaxies in boundary-crossing clusters in TNG100. We conclude by recommending a set of mandatory sanity checks that include positional verification, mass history analysis, and even exclusion of the buffer zone near the edges. These strategies ensure the robustness of the scientific results derived from these invaluable simulations.",

Comments are welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph) In this work, we perform a simulation-based forecasting analysis to compare the constraining power of two higher-order summary statistics of the large-scale structure (LSS), the Minkowski Functionals (MFs) and the Conditional Moments of Derivative (CMD), with a particular focus on their sensitivity to nonlinear and anisotropic features in redshift-space. Our analysis relies on halo catalogs from the Big Sobol Sequence(BSQ) simulations at redshift $z=0.5$, employing a likelihood-free inference framework implemented via neural posterior estimation. At the fiducial cosmology of the Quijote simulations $(\\Omega_{m}=0.3175,\\,\\sigma_{8}=0.834)$, and for the smoothing scale $R=15\\,h^{-1}$Mpc, we find that the CMD yields tighter forecasts for $(\\Omega_{m}},\\,\\sigma_{8})$ than the zeroth- to third-order MFs components, improving the constraint precision by ${\\sim}(44\\%,\\,52\\%)$, ${\\sim}(30\\%,\\,45\\%)$, ${\\sim}(27\\%,\\,17\\%)$, and ${\\sim}(26\\%,\\,17\\%)$, respectively. A joint configuration combining the MFs and CMD further enhances the precision by approximately ${\\sim}27\\%$ compared to the standard MFs alone, highlighting the complementary anisotropy-sensitive information captured by the CMD in contrast to the scalar morphological content encapsulated by the MFs. We further extend the forecasting analysis to a continuous range of cosmological parameter values and multiple smoothing scales. Our results show that, although the absolute forecast uncertainty for each component of summary statistics depends on the underlying parameter values and the adopted smoothing scale, the relative constraining power among the summary statistics remains nearly constant throughout.",

Submitted to Astrophysical Journal on 1 November 2025 Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) SPHEREx, a NASA explorer satellite launched on 11 March 2025, is carrying out the first all-sky near-infrared spectral survey. The satellite observes in 102 spectral bands from 0.75 to 5.0 um with a resolving power ranging from 35 to 130 in 6.2 arcsecond pixels. The observatory obtains a 5-sigma depth of 19.5 - 19.9 AB mag for 0.75 to 3.8 um and 17.8 - 18.8 AB mag for 3.8 to 5.0 um after mapping the full sky four times over two years. Scientifically, SPHEREx will produce a large galaxy redshift survey over the full sky, intended to constrain the amplitude of inflationary non-Gaussianity. The observations will produce two deep spectral maps near the ecliptic poles that will use intensity mapping to probe the evolution of galaxies over cosmic history. By mapping the depth of infrared absorption features over the Galactic plane, SPHEREx will comprehensively survey the abundance and composition of water and other biogenic ice species in the interstellar medium. The initial data are rapidly released in the form of spectral images to the public. The project will release specialized data products over the life of the mission as the surveys proceed. The science team will also produce specialized spectral catalogs on planet-bearing and low-mass stars, solar system objects, and galaxy clusters 3 years after launch. We describe the design of the instrument and spacecraft, which flow from the core science requirements. Finally, we present an initial evaluation of the in-flight performance and key characteristics.",

Mellier Submitted to A&A as part of the second Euclid Q1 paper splash Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The first Euclid Quick Data Release contains millions of galaxies with excellent optical and near-infrared (IR) coverage. To complement this dataset, we investigate the average far-IR properties of Euclid-selected main sequence (MS) galaxies using existing Herschel and SCUBA-2 data. We use 17.6deg$^2$ (2.4deg$^2$) of overlapping Herschel (SCUBA-2) data, containing 2.6 million (240000) MS galaxies. We bin the Euclid catalogue by stellar mass and photometric redshift and perform a stacking analysis following SimStack, which takes into account galaxy clustering and bin-to-bin correlations. We detect stacked far-IR flux densities across a significant fraction of the bins. We fit modified blackbody spectral energy distributions in each bin and derive mean dust temperatures, dust masses, and star-formation rates (SFRs). We find similar mean SFRs compared to the Euclid catalogue, and we show that the average dust-to-stellar mass ratios decreased from z$\\simeq$1 to the present day. Average dust temperatures are largely independent of stellar mass and are well-described by the function $T_2+(T_1-T_2){\\rm e}^{-t/\\tau}$, where $t$ is the age of the Universe, $T_1=79.7\\pm7.4$K, $T_2=23.2\\pm0.1$K, and $\\tau=1.6\\pm0.1$Gyr. We argue that since the dust temperatures are converging to a non-zero value below $z=1$, the dust is now primarily heated by the existing cooler and older stellar population, as opposed to hot young stars in star-forming regions at higher redshift. We show that since the dust temperatures are independent of stellar mass, the correlation between dust temperature and SFR depends on stellar mass. Lastly, we estimate the contribution of the Euclid catalogue to the cosmic IR background (CIB), finding that it accounts for >60% of the CIB at 250, 350, and 500$\\mu$m. Forthcoming Euclid data will extend these results to higher redshifts, lower stellar masses, and recover more of the CIB.",

Thanks to the geometrical interpretation of the solution in the inviscid limit, in terms of first-contact parabolas, we obtain explicit results for the multiplicity functions of shocks and voids, and for velocity and density one- and two-point correlation functions and power spectra. These initial conditions gives rise to self-similar dynamics with probability distributions that display power-law tails. In the limit where the exponent $\\alpha$ of the Poisson process that defines the initial conditions goes to infinity, the power-law tails steepen to Gaussian falloffs and we recover the spatial distributions obtained in the classical study by Kida (1979) of Gaussian initial conditions with vanishing large-scale power.",

The high-dimensional parameter space and the strong interdependencies among astrophysical, pulsar noise, and nuisance parameters introduce significant challenges for efficient learning and robust inference. These challenges are emblematic of broader issues in decision science, where model over-parameterization and prior sensitivity can compromise both computational tractability and the reliability of the results. We address these issues in the framework of hierarchical Bayesian modeling by introducing a reparameterization strategy. Our approach employs Normalizing Flows (NFs) to decorrelate the parameters governing hierarchical priors from those of astrophysical interest. The use of NF-based mappings provides both the flexibility to realize the reparametrization and the tractability to preserve proper probability densities. We further adopt i-nessai, a flow-guided nested sampler, to accelerate exploration of complex posteriors. This unified use of NFs improves statistical robustness and computational efficiency, providing a principled methodology for addressing hierarchical Bayesian inference in PTA analysis.",

In this study, we propose a novel method to test EP on cosmological scales by measuring the peculiar acceleration power spectrum of galaxies using the redshift drift technique. We develop an EP estimator, $E_{\\rm ep}$, to evaluate the consistency of the peculiar acceleration power spectrum across different tracers. By calculating the ratio of the peculiar acceleration power spectra of tracers, the ensemble average of $E_{\\rm ep}$ is expected to be unity if EP holds on cosmological scales for these tracers. We validate this estimator using N-body simulations, focusing on four redshift bins with $z\\leq 1.5$ and scales of $k$ in the range of $0.007$ and $0.2$ $h/\\rm Mpc$. By fitting a single parameter $\\delta_{\\rm ep}$ across redshifts, we find that DM particle mocks without EP violation yield $\\delta_{\\rm ep}$ consistent with zero under the small redshift measurement uncertainty case, while the large redshift uncertainty case slightly induces biases at low redshifts. In addition, when using DM halo mocks with controlled EP violations, no-violation and mild-violation cases show no significant detection, while moderate and strong violations produce statistically significant $\\delta_{\\rm ep}$ values and high $\\chi^2$, especially at low redshifts, confirming the estimator's sensitivity. Taking advantage of advanced observing capabilities, such as next-generation facilities that extend beyond the Square Kilometer Array, the proposed method offers a promising approach for future cosmological tests of EP.",

A. P. Martins 23 pages, 6 figures. Matching version published by JCAP Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Several assumptions at the foundation of the standard cosmological model have as a direct consequence a specific relation between cosmological distances, known as the distance duality relation, whose violation would be a smoking gun of deviations from standard cosmology. We explore the role of upcoming gravitational wave observations in investigating possible deviations from the distance duality relation, alongside the more commonly used supernovae. We find that, when combined with baryon acoustic oscillations, gravitational waves will provide similar constraining power to the combination of baryon acoustic oscillations and supernovae. Moreover, the combination of observables with different sensitivities to electromagnetic and gravitational physics provides a promising way to discriminate among different physical mechanisms that could lead to violations of the distance duality relation.",

Their X-ray observations reveal important physical properties and movements of the baryonic cycle of galactic ecosystems. However, the measured emissions toward a target at a cosmological distance would always include contributions from hot gases along the entire line of sight to the target. Observationally, such contaminations are routinely subtracted via different strategies. With this work, we aim to answer an interesting theoretical question regarding the amount of soft X-ray line emissions from intervening hot gases of different origins. We tackled this problem with the aid of the TNG100 simulation. We generated typical wide-field light cones and estimated their impacts on spectral and flux measurements toward X-ray-emitting galaxy-, group- and cluster-halo targets at lower redshifts. We split the intervening hot gases into three categories; that is, the hot gas that is gravitationally bound to either star-forming or quenched galaxy halos, and the diffuse gas, which is more tenuously distributed permeating the cosmic web structures. We find that along a given line of sight, the diffuse gas that permeates the cosmic web structures produces strong oxygen and iron line emissions at different redshifts. The diffuse gas emission in the soft X-ray band can be equal to the emission from hot gases that are gravitationally bound to intervening galaxy halos. The hot-gas emission from the quiescent galaxy halos can be significantly less than that from star-forming halos along the line of sight. The fluxes from all of the line-of-sight emitters as measured in the energy band of 0.4--0.85 keV can reach ~20--200 % of the emission from the target galaxy, group, and cluster halos.",

Substantial revision has been implemented: new emulators for polarisation power spectra, extented to lmax=4050, etc Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph) We present MomentEmu, a general-purpose polynomial emulator for fast and interpretable mappings between theoretical parameters and observational features. The method constructs moment matrices to project simulation data onto polynomial bases, yielding symbolic expressions that approximate the target mapping. Compared to neural-network-based emulators, MomentEmu offers negligible training cost, millisecond-level evaluation, and transparent functional forms. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we develop two emulators: PolyCAMB-$D_\\ell$, which maps six cosmological parameters to the CMB power spectra (TT, EE, BB, TE), and PolyCAMB-peak, which enables a bidirectional mapping between the cosmological parameters and the acoustic peak features of $D_\\ell^{\\rm TT}$. PolyCAMB-$D_\\ell$ achieves sub-percent accuracy over multipoles $\\ell \\leq 4050$, while PolyCAMB-peak also attains comparable precision and produces symbolic forms consistent with known analytical approximations. The method is well suited for forward modelling, parameter inference, and uncertainty propagation, particularly when the parameter space is moderate in dimensionality and the mapping is smooth. MomentEmu offers a lightweight and portable alternative to regression-based or black-box emulators in cosmological analysis.",

Minor changes to match published version Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We characterize the post-inflationary evolution of the equation of state of the universe from the end of inflation until the onset of radiation domination, when the inflaton is coupled to a daughter field through a trilinear interaction. We consider an inflaton potential that is quadratic near the minimum and flattens in the inflationary regime. By simulating the dynamics in 2+1-dimensional lattices, we have tracked the long-term evolution of the equation of state for about ten e-folds of expansion, for various coupling strengths. The trilinear interaction initially excites daughter field modes through a process of tachyonic resonance immediately after inflation and triggers a temporary deviation of the equation of state from $\\bar{w} = 0$ to a maximum value $\\bar{w} = \\bar{w}_{\\rm max} < 1/3$. However, at much later times, the inflaton homogeneous mode once again dominates the energy density, pushing the equation of state towards $\\bar{w} = 0$ until the onset of perturbative reheating. By combining the lattice results with a Boltzmann approach, we characterize the entire post-inflationary expansion history, which allows to calculate precise predictions for the inflationary CMB observables. We also accurately compute the redshift of the stochastic gravitational wave background produced during preheating, and show that taking the temporary return of the equation of state towards $\\bar{w} = 0$ into account can reduce the amplitude by many orders of magnitude relative to previous estimates.",

Given the central role of the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric in modeling cosmological distances, we investigate here whether these features instead point to a possible departure from the fundamental FLRW symmetries. Exploiting the transverse and line-of-sight distances provided by baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) observations, we demonstrate that observed distances hint at a slight but systematic preference for an anisotropic expansion rate emerging regardless of the dark energy model considered. Leveraging this non-FLRW feature, we investigate an inhomogeneous extension of the $\\Lambda$CDM model that naturally provides an anisotropic expansion rate. Our analysis demonstrates that models featuring spherical overdensities can explain BAO, supernova, and cosmic microwave background data, providing fits statistically indistinguishable from those obtained with a phantom dark energy scenario. When Pantheon+ data is considered, our analysis challenges the FLRW framework at $2.8\\sigma$ and yields scenarios that can be interpreted as subtle but non-negligible deviations from the FLRW metric. When DESY5 supernovae are considered instead, deviations are notably more significant, yielding scenarios that mildly violate the Copernican principle and exclude the FLRW assumption at $5.2\\sigma$. Overall, our results motivate a more in-depth investigation of whether the perfectly homogeneous and isotropic FLRW paradigm can still be assumed to accurately predict cosmological distances in the era of precision cosmology.",

Some have suggested this tension is alleviated if matter is converted to dark radiation via dark matter decay. As it is not clear that dark matter decays, we instead examine the effects of converting matter to gravitational radiation via black hole mergers. We consider mergers of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), mergers of stellar-mass black holes, and the formation of SMBHs from mergers of smaller black holes. We find that these processes cannot alleviate the tension, as an unrealistically large merger rate, or an overproduction of SMBHs is required. We also consider whether one can use the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect to constrain mechanisms that form SMBHs from mergers of smaller black holes. We find that this is also too small to be viable.",

Due to their short durations and cosmological distances, their dispersion measure (DM) - redshift ($z$) relation is useful for constraining cosmological parameters and detecting the baryons in the Universe. The increasing number of localized FRBs in recent years has provided more precise constraints on these parameters. However, the larger dataset reveals limitations in the widely used probability density function ($p_{\\rm diff}$) for ${\\rm DM}_{\\rm diff}$, which refers to the diffuse electron term of FRB DM. In this project, we collect 117 of the latest, localized FRBs, discuss the effect of a more accurate $\\sigma_{\\rm diff}$, which is a parameter in $p_{\\rm diff}$ and once thoughts as ``effective standard deviation'', and more clearly rewrite their likelihood to better constrain the parameters above. We find that the widely used approximation $\\sigma_{\\rm diff} \\sim F/\\sqrt{z}$ only works under contrived assumptions and shows the greatest deviation from the true standard deviation in low redshift. In general, one should use an accurate method to derive this parameter from $p_{\\rm diff}$. Our method yields better constraints on $H_0\\Omega_b f_{\\rm diff} = 2.813_{-0.258}^{+0.250}\\;{\\rm km/s/Mpc}$ or $H_0 = 66.889_{-5.459}^{+6.754} \\;{\\rm km/s/Mpc}$ when combining the FRB data with CMB measurements and taking $f_{\\rm diff} = 0.84$.

Comments and suggestions are welcome! Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Assembly bias, which is the variation in halo clustering at fixed mass driven by formation history, has long been predicted by numerical simulations but remains difficult to confirm observationally. Previous studies have reported evidence for halo assembly bias by dividing samples according to galaxy stellar mass using various methods. In this work, we present observational measurements of halo assembly bias based on the luminosity of spectroscopically confirmed brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). Using cluster catalogs and shear measurements from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, we employ a mass-dependent halo-bias model to disentangle halo bias from its underlying mass dependence in galaxy-galaxy lensing and clustering measurements. We confirm that brighter BCGs reside in more concentrated halos yet are less strongly clustered on large scales, with a relative bias ratio deviating from unity at the $\\sim 3\\sigma$ level, providing clear evidence of assembly bias. The results are further supported by the FLAMINGO and MillenniumTNG hydrodynamical simulations, in which we directly detect assembly bias signals consistent with the observations, thereby strengthening the connection between galaxy luminosity and halo formation history.",

To investigate multi-wavelength polarized features of CD kink instability in jets, we develop {\\tt RaptorP}, a new special relativistic module of the polarized General Relativistic Radiative Transfer (GRRT) code {\\tt RAPTOR}. Based on 3D SRMHD simulations of over-pressured magnetized jets, we find that jet images vary at different frequencies. At low frequencies, the emission comes from the turbulent ambient medium surrounding the jet that obscures the inner jet structure. Electronic Vector Position Angle (EVPA) patterns are perpendicular to the jet propagation direction, indicating a dominance of the poloidal magnetic field. At high frequencies, bright knots and twisted kink structures appear, and EVPA patterns are consistent with a toroidal magnetic field. We also find that QPOs in light curves of intensity and linear polarization (degree and angle). The peak frequency in Power Spectral Densities (PSDs) is well-matched with the rotation period of the kink structure in relativistic jets. It shows an anti-correlation between total intensity and the degree of polarization at a lower inclination angle. Our findings, based on realistic polarized radiation calculations, will explain the observational signatures seen in blazars.",

For PSR J1649+2533, our results suggest mode changing rather than subpulse drifting as previously reported at lower frequencies. For PSR J1752+2359, we confirm its quasi-periodic switching between distinct emission states, but further show that the so-called \"quasi-null\" or \"RRAT-like\" state actually consists of persistent low-level emission superposed with occasional bright pulses. For PSR J1819+1305, our data confirm the modulation reported earlier, while additional weaker features are also seen. For PSR J1916+1023, we detect both nulling and subpulse drifting, but find no clear evidence of direct interaction between them. These results provide new insights into the diverse manifestations of pulsar nulling, highlight the capability of FAST to detect subtle emission states, and add to the growing body of work on pulsar emission variability.",

Mondal, Biplab Raychaudhuri, Gulab C. Dewangan 23 pages, 8 figures and 7 tables, submitted to Journal of High Energy Astrophysics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We report on the results obtained by the analysis of persistent and type-I thermonuclear X-ray burst emission observed from the periodic burster 4U 1323-62. These analyses are based on the NuSTAR observation performed on 2024 August 7 for a total exposure of around 90 ks. The persistent emission is well described by an absorbed thermal Comptonization model. An absorption edge is also detected at an energy of approximately 7.87 keV, which indicates the presence of absorbing material in the vicinity of this system. Six bursts have been observed during this observation, wherein we find the burst recurrence time to be approximately 4.52 hr. All the bursts exhibit the characteristics of a sharp rise and exponential decay. We perform the time-resolved spectroscopy of the burst spectra described by a model consisting of thermal emission from the neutron star surface and a varying persistent emission component to study the evolution of burst parameters. The enhancement of the persistent emission during burst exposure is characterized by the scaling parameter f a, which reflects the increasing strength of the burst-disc interaction with burst intensity, likely driven by Poynting-Robertson drag. The spectral analysis of bursts estimate the average apparent blackbody emitting radius of the neutron star to lie within 1.5-3.5 km. The ignition depths computed from the burst parameters indicate short Type-I thermonuclear bursts from a mixed hydrogen-helium fuel layer.",

Miles High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The turbulent nature of the ionised interstellar medium (IISM) causes dispersion measure (DM) and scattering variations in pulsar timing measurements. To improve precision of gravitational wave measurements, pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have begun the use of sophisticated and intricate noise modelling techniques such as modelling stochastic variations induced by the turbulent IISM and quasi-deterministic processes attributed to discrete structures. However, the reliability of these techniques has not been studied in detail, and it is unclear whether the recovered processes are physical or if they are impacted by misspecification. In this work, we present an analysis to test the efficacy of IISM noise models based on the data from the MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array (MPTA) 4.5-year data release. We first performed multi-frequency, long-length (500 refractive length scale) simulations of multipath propagation in the IISM to study the properties of scattering variations under a variety of scattering conditions. The results of our simulations show the possibility of significant radio-frequency decorrelation in the scattering variations, particularly for the anisotropic scattering medium. Our analysis of the observed DM and scattering variations using the MPTA 4.5-year data set shows that there can be apparent anticorrelations between DM and scattering variations, which we attribute to the model fitting methods. We also report a possibility that plasma underdensities might exist along the sight lines of PSR J1431$-$5740 and PSR J1802$-$2124. Finally, using simulations, we show that the IISM noise models can result in the apparent measurement of strong frequency dependence of scattering variations observed in the MPTA data set. Our analysis shows that improvements in the IISM noise modelling techniques are necessary to accurately measure the IISM properties.",

For LISA sources, our findings point to an active EM signature in UV during optimal gravitational wave source localization.

Zdziarski, Swadesh Chand, Gulab Dewangan, Ranjeev Misra, Michal Szanecki, Bei You, Maxime Parra, Gregoire Marcel Submitted to ApJ, comments are welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We study the transient black hole binary MAXI J1631--479 in its soft spectral state observed simultaneously by the NICER and NuSTAR instruments. Its puzzling feature is the presence of a strong and broad Fe K line, while the continuum consists of a strong disk blackbody and a very weak power-law tail. The irradiation of the disk by a power-law spectrum fitting the tail is much too weak to account for the strong line. Two solutions were proposed in the past. One invoked an intrinsic Fe K disk emission, and the other invoked disk irradiation by the returning blackbody emission. We instead find that the strong line is naturally explained by the irradiation of the disk by the spectrum from Comptonization of the disk blackbody by coronal relativistic electrons. The shape of the irradiating spectrum at $\\lesssim$10 keV reflects that of the disk blackbody; it is strongly curved and has a higher flux than that of a fit with a power-law irradiation. That flux accounts for the line. While this result is independent of the physical model used for the disk intrinsic emission, the value of the fitted spin strongly depends on it. When using a Kerr disk model for a thin disk with a color correction, the fitted spin corresponds to a retrograde disk, unlikely for a Roche-lobe overflow binary. Then, a model accounting for both the disk finite thickness and radiative transfer yields a spin of $a_*\\approx0.8$--0.9, which underlines the strong model-dependence of X-ray spin measurements.",

We attempt to answer this question for the tMSP PSR J1023+0038 by segregating high-mode data and performing detailed spectral analysis using the XMM-Newton EPIC-PN+MOS1+MOS2 joint observations, XMM-Newton+NuSTAR joint observations, NICER and Chandra individual observations during different epochs. With the sum of longest exposures ($\\sim$202 ksec of high mode data from $\\sim$364 ksec of total exposure), we performed a self-consistent spectral analysis and constrain the inner disc radius 16.8 $\\pm$ 3.8 km with at least 3$\\sigma$ significance. Such a measurement is found consistent with best-fit spectral values of inner disc radius from other observatory like NICER and a joint observations with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR within 3$\\sigma$ limits. We also detect a Fe emission line at 6.45 keV, for the first time from a tMSP, in the Chandra spectrum with 99% significance with an upper limit of the inner disc radius of 21 R$_g$, supporting independently the fact that inner disc extends into neutron stars's magnetosphere during high mode. All results from our analysis imply that the accretion disc is significantly present and extended within the corotation radius of the neutron star in PSR J1023+0038 during the X-ray high-mode of the tMSP PSR J1023+0038. The measured range of inner disc radius is fully consistent with an independent analysis by Bhattacharyya (2020), which suggests continuous gravitational wave emission from this neutron star, and the standard model of X-ray pulsations in accreting MSPs.",

In this paper, we search for neutrinos from this failed supernova using data from Super-Kamiokande (SK). Based on the estimated time of black hole formation inferred from optical and infrared observations, we define a search window for neutrino events in the SK data. Using this window, we develop a dedicated analysis method for failed supernovae and apply it to M31-2014-DS1, by conducting a cluster search using the timing and energy information of candidate events. No significant neutrino excess is observed within the search region. Consequently, we place an upper limit on the electron antineutrino luminosity from M31-2014-DS1 and discuss its implications for various failed SN models and their neutrino emission characteristics. Despite the 18 MeV threshold adopted to suppress backgrounds, the search remains sufficiently sensitive to constrain the Shen-TM1 EOS, yielding a 90% confidence level upper limit of 1.76 \\times 10^{53} erg on the electron antineutrino luminosity, slightly above the expected value of 1.35 \\times 10^{53} erg.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The properties of the population of compact objects created in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are uncertain. X-ray observations years to decades after the explosions offer a way to gain insight into this, as hard X-ray emission from the central regions will emerge as the ejecta absorption decreases. Here we analyze and place upper limits on late-time X-ray emission in 242 nearby SNe, using 607 observations from Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift, and NuSTAR. We use absorption models based on 3D simulations of neutrino-driven explosions to account for absorption of emission from the compact objects by the asymmetric ejecta. We detect X-ray emission from 12 SNe, including four for the first time (SN 1982R, SN 1984J, SN 1992bu, and SN 2003gk), and several of the others at later epochs than before. The X-ray spectra of these SNe are consistent with interaction with the circumstellar medium (CSM), with the possible exception of SN 1979C, which shows an additional hard component, as also noted in previous studies at earlier epochs. This emission may be due to a pulsar wind nebula. Using the upper limits in the full sample, we also perform a population synthesis to constrain the fraction of SNe that produce pulsars and the properties of the pulsars themselves. We find that pulsar populations with mean initial spin periods $\\gtrsim100\\rm~ ms$ are favored. Finally, we note that the high luminosities of several of the SNe with CSM interaction imply interactions with dense shells.",

After first round of revision in A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present that the broad feature usually observed in X-ray spectra can be explained by a ray-traced emission from a two-slab system containing a dissipative, warm corona on top of an accretion disk in an AGN. Such an accretion flow is externally illuminated by X-ray radiation from a lamp located above a central SMBH. Thermal lines from highly ionized iron ions (FeXXV and FeXXVI), caused by both internal heating and reflection from the warm corona, can be integrated into an observed broad line profile due to the close vicinity of the SMBH. We investigate the dependence of the broad line profile by varying the SMBH spin parameter, viewing angle, lamp height, and dissipation factor. Our results introduce a new method to probe properties of the warm corona using high-resolution spectroscopic measurements. We use the photoionization code TITAN to compute local ion populations and emission line profiles, and the ray-tracing code GYOTO to include relativistic effects on the outgoing X-ray spectrum. In our models, the temperature of the inner atmosphere covering the disk can reach values of 10^7 - 10^8 K due to internal warm corona dissipation and external illumination, which is adequate for generating the highly ionized iron lines. These lines can undergo significant gravitational redshift near the black hole, leading to a prominent spectral feature centered around 6.4 keV. For all computed models, the relativistic corrections shift highly ionized iron lines to the X-ray region, usually attributed to fluorescent emission from the illuminated skin of an accretion disk. Hence, in the case of a warm corona covering the inner disk regions, the resulting theoretical line profile under strong gravity is a sum of different iron line transitions, and those originating from highly ionized iron contribute the most to the observed total line profile in AGN.",

Its bounds and density profile carry crucial information about the nature of superdense matter. Physically, the EOS-parameter $\\phi$ represents the mean stiffness of matter accumulated from the stellar surface up to a given density. Based on the intrinsic structure of the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations, we show that $\\phi$ decreases monotonically outward from the NS center, independent of any specific input NS EOS model. Furthermore, observational evidence of a peak in the speed-of-sound squared (SSS) density-profile near the center effectively rules out a valley and a subsequent peak in the radial profile of $\\phi$ at similar densities, reinforcing its monotonic decrease. These model-independent relations impose strong constraints on the near-center behavior of the EOS-parameter $\\phi$, particularly demonstrating that the mean stiffness (or equivalently $\\Delta$) reaches a local maximum (minimum) at the center.",

While photometric light curves provide broad temporal coverage, spectroscopic observations remain crucial for physical interpretation and source classification. However, existing spectral analysis methods -- often reliant on template fitting or parametric models -- are limited in their ability to capture the complex and evolving spectra characteristic of such sources, which are sometimes only available at low resolution. In this work, we introduce SpectraNet, a deep convolutional neural network designed to learn robust representations of optical spectra from transients. Our model combines multi-scale convolution kernels and multi-scale pooling to extract features from preprocessed spectra in a hierarchical and interpretable manner. We train and validate SpectraNet on low-resolution time-series spectra obtained from the Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM) and other instruments, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in classification. Furthermore, in redshift prediction tasks, SpectraNet achieves a root mean squared relative redshift error of 0.02, highlighting its effectiveness in precise regression tasks as well.",

The annual number of peer-reviewed articles utilising XMM-Newton data has exhibited a consistent upward trajectory over the past two and a half decades, attaining more than 400 in 2022. The annual call for observing time proposals continues to experience a high level of oversubscription, typically ranging from a factor of 6 to 7. In order to enhance the scientific discovery space, XMM-Newton, primarily through the Project Scientist and Science Operations Centre, has pursued a strategy of expansion, which can be grouped into three phases: Large Projects with long observing time (2006-2009), Joint Observations (2011-2016), and Targets of Opportunity (2016-2024), respectively. A salient feature of XMM-Newton's time allocation is the systematic removal of biases from the second call onwards, a strategy that has enabled the attainment of comparable gender success rates and high acceptance rates for young scientists over 25 years, a feat only recently accomplished by similar missions through the introduction of double-anonymous review. XMM-Newton research is conducted by an active community of 4,300 scientists, of which approximately 570 are leading (1st author). The foundation of this community and its research is predicated on XMM-Newton data, with the project's policy of user support and calibration being fundamental constituents, as well as the project's active engagement and communication with its members.",

Lin Accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are important drivers of galactic evolution; however, the underlying physical processes governing their properties remain uncertain. In particular, the specific cause for the generation of the broad-line region is unclear. There is a region where the underlying accretion disc atmosphere becomes cool enough for dust condensation. Using models of the disc's vertical structure, accounting for dust condensation and irradiation from the central source, we show that their upper atmospheres become extended, dusty, and radiation-pressure-supported. Due to the density--temperature dependence of dust condensation, this extended atmosphere forms as the dust abundance slowly increases with height, resulting in density and temperature scale heights considerably larger than the gas pressure scale height. We show that such an atmospheric structure is linearly unstable. An increase in the gas density raises the dust sublimation temperature, leading to an increased dust abundance, a higher opacity, and hence a net vertical acceleration. Using localised 2D hydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate the existence of our linear instability. In the non-linear state, the disc atmosphere evolves into ``fountains'' of dusty material that are vertically launched by radiation pressure before being exposed to radiation from the central source, which sublimates the dust and shuts off the radiative acceleration. These dust-free clumps then evolve ballistically, continuing upward before falling back towards the disc under gravity. This clumpy ionized region has velocity dispersions $\\gtrsim 1000$ km/s. This instability and our simulations are representative of the Failed Radiatively Accelerated Dusty Outflow (FRADO) model proposed for the AGN broad-line region.",

Chen Phys. Rev. E 112, 055201 (2025) Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We propose a particle acceleration mechanism driven by large-amplitude Alfvén waves in a strong magnetic field. The acceleration process proceeds through multiple stages triggered by counterpropagating wave-particle resonant acceleration (CWRA) via decay instability. Initially, parent and daughter Alfvén waves resonantly accelerate particles perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field. The resultant modulational instability generates electrostatic fields within the wave packet, which are locally amplified by the ponderomotive force of the Alfvén wave packet. These fields subsequently drive further acceleration within a few relativistic gyroperiods via gyroresonant surfing acceleration (GRSA). During this, the v*B force facilitates momentum transfer from the perpendicular to the parallel direction. In the later stage, particles become trapped by the parent wave and gain additional energy through single wave resonant acceleration (SWRA). Furthermore, the accumulation of accelerated particles induces electrostatic trailing fields behind and at the tail of the wave packet, which drive trailing-field acceleration (TFA) of other electrons. The combined effects of these mechanisms, CWRA followed by GRSA and SWRA, result in highly relativistic electron energy. The electron energy accelerated through the above process is higher than that accelerated through TFA. This multistage acceleration process provides insights into the generation of high energy cosmic rays in astrophysical environments.",

Myrto Falalaki, Vasiliki Pavlidou 8 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics (A&A), comments welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Cosmic ray (CR) knees (spectral steepenings) encode information on CR accelerator populations. We seek population features that imprint onto knee observables in a manner that is robust enough to be discernible even in the presence of significant systematics in CR data. In particular, we explore how diversity among population members could imprint on the knee phenomenology, under the assumption that a knee is due to a fixed-rigidity cutoff in the source spectra. We use a simple theoretical model for a population of CR accelerators. Each population member accelerates CR to a power-law spectrum, up to a cutoff rigidity. We allow for variance among members, in cutoff rigidity and power-law slope. We find that: (a) the slope step of the spectrum is $\\sim 0.5$, decreasing weakly with increasing spread in either property; (b) composition always breaks first; (c) the difference between the break energies in composition and flux increases with increasing diversity; (d) composition and flux break together only if population diversity is minimal. These trends are robust under our assumptions; deviations from them would indicate more complex physics than encoded in our simple model. Comparing these trends with observed CR knees, we conclude that: (i) the primary knee at $\\sim 4\\times10^{15}$ eV is consistent with a constant-rigidity cutoff according to KASCADE-Grande data processed with post-LHC hadronic models, but not according to other datasets; (ii) the second knee at $\\sim 5 \\times 10^{17}$ eV requires more complexity than our model; (iii) the spectral feature identified by Auger at $\\sim 10^{19}$ eV is consistent with a constant-rigidity source cutoff only if there is a substantial spread in both cutoff rigidity and slope. Interestingly, a significant spread in slope would also result in spectral curvature before the break, which would in turn be contributing to the ankle feature.",

In this work, we perform numerical simulations of UHECR propagation in a magnetized universe to investigate the spectral signatures of jetted and nonjetted astrophysical sources. We demonstrate, for the first time, that under certain conditions, emission geometry can play a decisive role in shaping the observed spectrum of individual UHECR sources. These findings provide new insights into the conditions necessary for detecting UHECRs from jets, and highlight how the interplay between emission geometry and magnetic fields influences observed energy spectra.",

Kovacs, Norbert Werner, Akos Bogdan, Jelle de Plaa 11 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present the X-ray analysis of seven local compact elliptical galaxies (cEGs), selected for their morphological resemblance to high-redshift red nuggets. As likely descendants of the red nugget population, cEGs offer a unique window into the early Universe, enabling the study of early galaxy evolution and the interplay between black holes, stellar bulges, and dark matter halos. Using data from Chandra and XMM-Newton, we investigate the properties of the hot gaseous halos in cEGs. Two galaxies - MRK 1216 and PGC 32873 - host luminous, spatially extended X-ray atmospheres, allowing us to derive radial thermodynamic profiles. For MRK 1216, we performed high-resolution spectral modeling with RGS data, which hints at super-solar $\\alpha/\\rm{Fe}$ abundance ratios. The remaining galaxies show either faint or undetected X-ray halos, though several display AGN-like (active galactic nucleus) power-law emission. In the context of local scaling relations, cEGs show only mild deviations from the general galaxy population, exhibiting a slightly steeper $M_{\\star}-L_{X}$ relation and occupying the lower boundary of the $M_{\\star}$-$M_{\\rm vir}$ relation. These trends suggest that high-redshift red nuggets may also host a diverse range of X-ray atmospheres. We speculate that the compactness of cEGs may trace back to the population of `little red dots' (LRDs), hinting at a potential link between LRDs, red nuggets, and compact relic galaxies in the local Universe.",

Pye, Pierluigi Rinaldi, Paul van der Werf, Marta Volonteri Submitted to ApJ; 26 pages, 12 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs, $M_\\text{BH}\\sim10^9 M_\\odot$) at $z>7$ remains a puzzle. While their existence appears to require exotic formation or growth processes, it is possible that BH mass estimates are incorrect due to differences from the low-$z$ quasars where BH mass scaling relations are calibrated. In this work, we employ JWST MIRI-MRS spectroscopy to measure the rest-frame optical/IR properties of the four highest-redshift known luminous type-1 quasars at $7.08\\leq z<7.64$. We use three new broad lines to measure updated BH masses, H$\\alpha$, Pa$\\alpha$ and Pa$\\beta$, finding them to be in the range $(4-15)\\cdot10^8 M_\\odot$. Our black hole mass estimates from all tracers agree with each other and with previous, less accurate, ground-based measurements based on MgII. The flux ratios of the H lines deviate from expectations for case A and B recombination in the same way as in $z<3$ quasars, indicating similar physical conditions in the Broad Line Region. Rest-frame near-IR continuum emission from a hot dusty torus surrounding the accretion disc is unambiguously detected in all four objects. We model the emission with SKIRTOR and constrain the inclination (face-on) and the opening angle ($\\theta=40-60^\\circ$) of the tori. These constraints are consistent for the four objects and with expectations from luminous quasars. We estimate a total dust mass $(1-4)\\cdot10^6 M_\\odot$ in the tori, corresponding to $(0.2-7)\\%$ of the total dust in the quasar host galaxies. Given observed accretion rates, these SMBHs will deplete their tori in only $\\sim5$ Myr. Overall, we confirm that $z>7$ SMBHs in quasars could not have grown from stellar-remnant BHs if the radiative efficiency of accretion is $10\\%$. We also find no evidence that inferred BH masses and accretion processes in $z>7$ quasars differ significantly from their near-identical counterparts at $z<3$.",

      "abstract": "Dynamical evolution of stellar binaries in galactic centers Mark Dodici, Scott Tremaine, Yanqin Wu 16 pages, 10 figures. Submitted to ApJ. Comments welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Stellar binaries in galactic centers are relevant to several observable phenomena, including hypervelocity stars, X-ray binaries, and mergers of stars and compact objects; however, we know little about the properties of these binaries. Past works have suggested that a small fraction of them should contract to a few stellar radii or collide, due to the co-operation of stellar tides and the eccentricity oscillations induced by the strong tidal field of the central massive black hole. We revisit this model with several updates. We first argue that when a binary's pericenter separation is driven down to a few stellar radii, diffusive excitation of stellar tides should quickly contract the orbit, saving the stars from collision. Instead, the stars should end up as a very tight binary. We then show that vector resonant relaxation and perturbations from passing stars -- effects not included in past models -- dramatically increase the prevalence of such encounters. In numerical experiments, we find that 1 in 5 binaries around 1 pc from Sgr A* should tidally contract in this way while still on the main sequence. This rate climbs to 3 in 5 around 0.01 pc, inward of which it plateaus. We briefly discuss observable implications of these results, with particular attention to young stellar binaries in the Galactic Center.",

Johnson, Roberto Maiolino 16 pages, 17 figures, 4 tables. Submitted to MNRAS. Comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Direct observations of Lyman continuum (LyC) radiation from galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) are impeded by absorption in the intergalactic medium, requiring indirect methods to infer the escape fraction of ionizing photons ($f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm LyC}$). One approach is to develop and validate such methods on local analogues of the high-redshift galaxies with directly detected LyC leakage. In this work, we constrain $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm LyC}$ using a Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting framework built on Prospector, which incorporates a non-parametric star-formation history, a flexible dust attenuation curve, self-consistent nebular emission, and fiber aperture-loss corrections. Our methodology jointly fits broadband photometry and emission line fluxes. We apply six models to the Low-redshift LyC Survey (LzLCS), a sample of local galaxies with properties comparable to EoR galaxies, and evaluate them based on their ability to recover the observed LyC flux and their relative Bayesian evidence. The best-performing model is further assessed through a parameter recovery test, demonstrating that $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm LyC}$can be recovered within uncertainties. Building on these results, we present updated $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm LyC}$ estimates for the LzLCS sample, with a median of 0.3%, corresponding to very low leakage, and values reaching as high as 70%, with six of 64 galaxies having a cosmologically relevant $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm LyC}$ ($>5%$). Additionally, we present a revised UV $\\beta$-slope vs $\\log_{10}(f_\\mathrm{esc}^\\mathrm{LyC})$ relation, derived using symbolic regression with PySR trained on a synthetic dataset generated from our best-performing model: $\\log_{10}(f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm LyC}) = (-3.59\\beta - 9.45) \\, \\pm \\, 0.30$. The relation successfully reproduces the $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm LyC}$ obtained from full SED fitting of the LzLCS sample within uncertainties.",

Lindholm Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The evolution of the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) is a powerful probe of early star formation and stellar mass build-up. At z > 6, its bright end (MUV < -21) remains poorly constrained due to the small volumes of existing near-infrared (NIR) space-based surveys. The Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs) will cover 53 deg^2 with NIR imaging down to 26.5 AB, increasing area by a factor of 100 over previous space-based surveys. They thus offer an unprecedented opportunity to select bright z > 6 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and constrain the UV LF's bright end. With NIR coverage extending to 2um, Euclid can detect galaxies out to z = 13. We present forecasts for the number densities of z > 6 galaxies expected in the final EDF dataset. Using synthetic photometry from spectral energy distribution (SED) templates of z = 5--15 galaxies, z = 1--4 interlopers, and Milky Way MLT dwarfs, we explore optimal selection methods for high-z LBGs. A combination of S/N cuts with SED fitting (from optical to MIR) yields the highest-fidelity sample, recovering >76% of input z > 6 LBGs while keeping low-z contamination <10%. This excludes instrumental artefacts, which will affect early Euclid releases. Auxiliary data are critical: optical imaging from the Hyper Suprime-Cam and Vera C. Rubin Observatory distinguishes genuine Lyman breaks, while Spitzer/IRAC data help recover z > 10 sources. Based on empirical double power-law LF models, we expect >100,000 LBGs at z = 6-12 and >100 at z > 12 in the final Euclid release. In contrast, steeper Schechter models predict no z > 12 detections. We also present two ultra-luminous (MUV < -23.5) candidates from the EDF-N Q1 dataset. If their redshifts are confirmed, their magnitudes support a DPL LF model at z > 9, highlighting Euclid's power to constrain the UV LF's bright end and identify the most luminous early galaxies for follow-up.",

Roman-Duval Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We measure the star formation histories (SFHs) from the Scylla survey in approximately 98,000 pc^2 and 75,000 pc^2 of the SMC and LMC, respectively, using deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging (80% complete to more than 1 mag below the ancient main-sequence turnoff, 25.1 and 26.0 mag in F475W and F814W) from 74 pointings. We group the fields into eight sub-regions in the SMC and seven in the LMC. We use the birth rate parameter to identify bursts of star formation and measure their properties in each sub-region. Our methodology provides a standardized framework for burst identification and reveals both broad and fine burst characteristics. We identify global and local bursts, defined as those occurring in at least half or less than half of a galaxy's sub-regions, respectively. In the SMC we find two global (about 5 and 1.5 Gyr ago) and one local burst (about 3 Gyr ago). In the LMC we find one global burst (about 3 Gyr ago). Comparing these findings with dynamical models of the LMC and SMC orbital histories, we find that when models predict a shared dynamical trigger for bursts across both galaxies, the burst begins earlier in the SMC with a greater enhancement in star formation rate than in the LMC. Finally, using age-metallicity relations (AMRs) and cumulative SFHs, we report that the Wing/Bridge region in the SMC resembles the southwestern LMC both chemically and in stellar mass assembly over the last about 7 Gyr, possibly due to stellar material stripped from the LMC during their last interaction.",

Hornstrup Paper submitted as part of the A&A Special Issue `Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1)', 16 pages, 7 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) (Abridged) The bimodality between star-forming discs and quiescent spheroids requires the existence of two main processes: the galaxy quenching and the morphological transformation. In this paper, we aim to understand the link between these processes and their relation with the stellar mass of galaxies and their local environment. Taking advantage of the first data released by the Euclid Collaboration, covering more than 60 deg2 with space-based imaging and photometry, we analyse a mass-complete sample of nearly one million galaxies in the range 0.25<z<1 with $M_\\ast>10^{9.5} M_\\odot$. We divide the sample into four sub-populations of galaxies, based on their star-formation activity and morphology. We then analyse the physical properties of these populations and their relative abundances in the stellar mass vs. local density plane. Together with confirming the passivity-density relation and the morphology-density relation, we find that quiescent discy galaxies are more abundant in the low-mass regime of high-density environment. At the same time, star-forming bulge-dominated galaxies are more common in field regions, preferentially at high masses. Building on these results and interpreting them through comparison with simulations, we propose a scenario where the evolution of galaxies in the field significantly differs from that in higher-density environments. The morphological transformation in the majority of field galaxies takes place before the onset of quenching and is mainly driven by secular processes taking place within the main sequence, leading to the formation of star-forming bulge-dominated galaxies as intermediate-stage galaxies. Conversely, quenching of star formation precedes morphological transformation for most galaxies in higher-density environments. This causes the formation of quiescent disc-dominated galaxies before their transition into bulge-dominated ones.",

Albán, R.A. Riffel, C. Bertemes, A. Schnorr-Müller, R. Riffel, B. Dall'Agnol de Oliveira, P. Kukreti 19 pages, 21 figures. Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been observed in dwarf galaxies, yet the impact of black hole feedback in these low-mass systems remains unclear. To uncover the potential effects of AGN in the low-mass galaxy regime, we study the properties and demographics of active dwarf galaxies at $z=0$, using the IllustrisTNG simulations. We use data from the TNG50-1 simulation, selecting central galaxies with stellar masses in the range $8 \\leq \\log(M_\\ast/{\\rm M_\\odot}) \\leq 9.5$, and selecting AGN based on their Eddington ratio ($\\lambda_{\\rm Edd}$). We analyzed the properties and environment of AGN host galaxies and compared them with inactive control galaxies. The AGN fractions found in the simulation depend strongly on the threshold for $\\lambda_{\\rm Edd}$ in the AGN selection, ranging from $\\sim$ 1\\% ($\\lambda_{\\rm Edd} \\geq 0.05$) to $\\sim$ 24\\% ($\\lambda_{\\rm Edd} \\geq 0.01$). In comparison with non-AGN galaxies of similar stellar and halo mass, dwarf AGN hosts are deficient in neutral gas, having $\\sim$ 3.9 times less neutral mass, in qualitative agreement with observations. The dearth in neutral gas is stronger beyond two stellar half-mass radii ($r \\gtrsim 3$ kpc), and AGN hosts have more extended gas components than non-AGN galaxies, with a gas half-mass radius, on average, $\\gtrsim$ 10 kpc larger. AGN hosts are also slightly less star-forming, but have no differences in local environment. We found that AGN can significantly decrease the neutral gas component of dwarf galaxies, a direct effect of the high-accretion feedback mode employed in IllustrisTNG. However, it is important to test our findings with observations to unveil the complete role of AGN in dwarf galaxies. In TNG50, dwarf AGN fractions are an order of magnitude larger than those observed, motivating a detailed investigation to precisely quantify the mismatch between simulations and observations.",

Lloro, G. Mainetti, D. Maino, E. Maiorano, O. Mansutti 22 pages, 16 figures, submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Using the large statistics provided by both Euclid and the LOFAR surveys, we present the first large-scale study of the connection between radio emission, its morphology, and the merging properties of the hosts of radio sources up to z=2. By dividing the radio sample into active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming galaxies, we find that radio-emitting AGN show a clear preference to reside within galaxies undergoing a merging event. This is more significant for AGN that present extended and/or complex radio emission: indeed, about half of them are associated with merging systems, while only 15% are hosted by an isolated galaxy. The observed trend is primarily driven by AGN residing at z < 1, especially in the case of high - P144MHz > 10^24 W Hz-1 sr-1 - radio luminosities (60% in mergers versus 10% isolated regardless of radio appearance). The situation is reversed in the case of radio-emitting star-forming galaxies, which are preferentially associated with isolated systems. This is more significant as we move towards low radio-luminosity/star-formation objects (P144MHz < 10^23 W Hz-1 sr-1) for which we find 40% in isolated systems versus 20% in mergers. These values hold regardless of redshift. We interpret the above result for AGN with their need to accrete outer gas from local encounters in order to trigger (radio) activity, especially in the case of extended radio emission such as hot-spots and lobes. This is mostly observed at z < 1, since in the local Universe galaxies are more gas deprived than their higher-redshift counterparts. Internal gas reservoirs instead seem sufficient to trigger star formation within the majority of galaxies, which indeed prefer to be associated with isolated systems at all redshifts probed.

Meneghetti Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) are believed to form primarily through mergers of less massive progenitors, leaving behind numerous traces of violent formation histories, such as stellar streams and shells. A particularly striking signature of these mergers is the formation of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries, which can create depleted stellar cores through interactions with stars on radial orbits - a process known as core scouring. The secondary SMBH in such systems may still carry a dense stellar envelope and thereby remain observable for some time as a secondary nucleus, while it is sinking towards the shared gravitational potential of the merged galaxy. We leverage Euclid's Q1 Early Release data to systematically search for secondary nuclei in ETGs. We present a preliminary sample of 666 candidate systems distributed over 504 hosts (some of which contain multiple secondary nuclei). The vast majority of these fall at separations of 3 kpc to 15 kpc, indicative of normal mergers. 44 fall at projected separations of less than 2 kpc. We argue those candidates at very close angular separations are unlikely to be a consequence of chance alignments. We show that their stellar masses are mostly too large for them to be globular clusters and that a significant subset are unresolved even at Euclid's spatial resolution, rendering them too small to be dwarf galaxies. These may represent the highest-density nuclei of a previously merged galaxy, currently sinking into the centre of the new, common gravitational potential and thus likely to host a secondary SMBH. We then demonstrate that convolutional neural networks offer a viable avenue to detect multiple nuclei in the thirty-times larger sky coverage of the future Euclid DR1. Finally, we argue that our method could detect the remnants of a recoil event from two merged SMBHs.",

Keihänen Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) This study explores a rare population of sources in a currently uncharted region of spectroscopic redshift space in the Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1), and is intended potentially to support upcoming spectroscopic studies. Our goal is to identify and investigate a population of sources characterised by highly ionised emission lines in their spectra, which are indicative of active galactic nucleus activity, extreme shock phenomena, or Wolf--Rayet stars. A comprehensive visual inspection of spectra is conducted to ensure the reliability of the sample, focusing on the simultaneous detection of both NeV and OII emission-line measurements, a condition that restricts the Euclid spectroscopic redshift range to z=2.48--3.88. To characterise this population, we analysed the morpho-spectrophotometric properties of their host galaxies. This allowed for a direct comparison with control sources that exhibit similar OII properties and spectroscopic redshifts, but not NeV lines. We identify sources solely based on spectroscopic criteria in the redshift range beyond the Halpha regime. Encompassing 65 potential NeV candidates, the resulting sample delivers the first systematic probe of these NeV candidate emitters at high redshift. We found a good agreement, within 1$\\sigma$, between the spectral measurements calculated using both direct integration and Gaussian fitting methodologies. The NeV candidates exhibit colours similar to bright QSOs, with only a few in the tail of very red quasars. We observed a higher stellar mass content, a lower continuum around the 4000A break, and a similar Sérsic index distribution compared to the control sample. This unique sample paves the way for a wide range of scientific investigations, which will be pursued in the forthcoming data releases.",

Zavala, Jacopo Chevallard, Denis Burgarella, Michaela Hirschmann, Tom Bakx, Alba Vidal-Garcia, Antonello Calabrò, Anna Feltre Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) GHZ2 is among the highest-redshift galaxies discovered to date, exhibiting a spectrum rich with prominent emission lines in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) and optical. These features raise critical questions about the mechanism powering this nebular emission, in particular the extremely strong C IV$\\lambda$1548 emission (rest-frame EW $=$ 45 Angstrom). Here we aim to quantify the AGN contribution within this system using the BEAGLE-AGN tool to simultaneously fit the spectrum and photometry of GHZ2. We consider a range of models with and without AGN components, allowing us to disentangle the stellar and AGN contribution of GHZ2 for the first time. We conclude that a partial contribution by an AGN is significantly favored based on the Bayes factor comparison to models without an AGN component, measuring an AGN contribution of 54$^{+1}_{-1}$% and 26$^{+4}_{-2}$% for the C IV$\\lambda$1548 and C III]$\\lambda$1908 emission lines, respectively. We obtain an estimate for the black hole mass using the accretion luminosity ($L_{acc}$) from the best fit BEAGLE-AGN model, computing a value of log$_{10}$(M$_{BH}$/M$_{\\odot}$) = 7.20$^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$, for an Eddington ratio of $\\eta$ = 0.5 (with a systematic uncertainty of $\\sim$1 dex). The inferred black hole mass to stellar mass ratio is 0.05$^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$, consistent with other high redshift AGN systems. If the black hole interpretation is confirmed, GHZ2 would represent the most distant black hole identified to date, making it an ideal laboratory to study AGN growth and their role in shaping high-redshift galactic evolution.",

Behara, Amit Seta 7 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables; under review with MNRAS; comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) The small-scale turbulent dynamo is a key mechanism for amplifying galactic magnetic fields, yet the resulting field morphology remains poorly understood. Using 3D driven turbulence simulations across a range of compressibilities, characterised by Mach number, and Minkowski functionals, we quantitatively investigate the morphology of magnetic fields generated by the small-scale turbulent dynamo in both the exponentially growing kinematic stage and the statistically steady saturated stage. In both stages and across all Mach numbers, we find that the magnetic field departs significantly from a Gaussian random field. Magnetic structures are statistically less curved and more interconnected in the saturated stage than in the kinematic stage, with these morphological differences decreasing as compressibility increases. Our work provides a quantitative description of how density fluctuations in turbulence and the back-reaction of amplified magnetic fields via the Lorentz force together shape complex, non-Gaussian magnetic structures and offers a valuable framework for comparing simulations with polarisation observations.",

To ensure a robust sample, we select subhalos based on the angle subtended by the angular momentum profiles, as well as on a visual inspection. The analysis is focused on galaxies with stellar masses greater than 10$^{9}$ M$_\\odot$. In addition, a dynamic decomposition is employed to separate the stellar and gaseous ring from the host galaxy. This results in a sample of 32 subhalos with PRGs. This sample exhibits properties similar to those observed. These include colours typical of early-type galaxies (ETGs) or those transitioning toward blue systems. Most host galaxies are classified as ETGs, with 37.5\\% exhibiting a disk-dominated morphology. The mean bulge-to-total (B/T) ratio is 0.64. Rings have average radii that are 2.36 and 3.41 times larger than their effective radii for the stellar and gaseous components, respectively, with star formation occurring predominantly within the rings. In contrast with observations, rings in the simulation tend to be less massive and slightly less perpendicular. The obtained sample displays a variety of host galaxy morphologies, including wide and narrow rings, providing a robust framework for studying the varied structural characteristics of PRG variants.",

Our results show that both the mean rest equivalent width ($W_{0}$) profiles and covering fractions of MgII and CIV increase with ELG stellar mass at similar impact parameters, but show similar distributions when normalized by the virial radius. Moreover, warm CIV gas has a more extended distribution than cool MgII gas. The dispersion of MgII and CIV gas velocity offsets relative to the galaxy redshifts rises from $\\sim100 \\, \\rm km \\, s^{-1}$ within halos to $\\sim 200 \\, \\rm km \\, s^{-1}$ beyond. We explore the relationships between MgII and CIV $W_{0}$ and show that the two are not tightly coupled: at a fixed absorption strength of one species, the other varies by several-fold, indicating distinct kinematics between the gas phases traced by each. We measure the line ratios, FeII/MgII and CIV/MgII, of strong MgII absorbers and find that at $<0.2$ virial radius, the FeII/MgII ratio is elevated, while the CIV/MgII ratio is suppressed compared with the measurements on larger scales, both with $\\sim4-5\\, \\sigma$ significance. We argue that multiphase gas that is not co-spatial is required to explain the observational results. Finally, by combining with measurements from the literature, we investigate the redshift evolution of CGM properties and estimate the neutral hydrogen, metal, and dust masses in the CGM of DESI ELGs -- found to be comparable to those in the ISM.",

The catalogs are built by coupling the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) semi-analytical model of galaxy formation with merger trees extracted from the simulations using the Hierarchical Bound-Tracing (HBT+) algorithm. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and broadband magnitudes are computed using the neural-network-based stellar population synthesizer StarDuster, which is trained on radiative transfer simulations to account for detailed galaxy geometry in modeling dust obscuration. Galaxy light-cones up to $z=5$ are subsequently generated with the BLiC light-cone builder which interpolates the properties of galaxies over time using an optimized interpolation scheme. The resulting catalogs exhibit good convergence in many statistical properties of the galaxy population produced from two different resolution simulations. The catalogs reproduce a number of observed galaxy properties across a range of galaxy mass and redshift, including the stellar mass functions, the luminosity function, gas mass fraction, galaxy size-mass relation and galaxy clustering. We also present the photometric and redshift distributions of galaxies expected to be observed in the CSST surveys.",

It has two components, A1 and A2, which are diverse according to their physical and chemical properties. We modeled this hot corino using the RATRAN radiative transfer code and explained different spectral signatures observed towards A1 and A2, specifically for CH3OH and H2CO. Our main goal is to understand the kinematical and chemical differences between A1 and A2 and to classify their dust emission and absorption properties. We considered a simple 1D spherical infalling envelope consisting of collimated outflow in the source. Recent high-resolution interferometric observations of ALMA shed new light on why the same molecular transitions towards A1 and A2 show different spectral profiles. The significant difference between spectral profiles observed towards A1 and A2 is mainly due to the dust opacity effect. Dust continuum emission toward A1 is optically thick, causing the transitions observed in absorption. Meanwhile, A2 is optically thin, leading to the observed emission profiles, and an inverse P-Cygni profile suggests the presence of an infalling envelope. Using high-resolution observations from ALMA and VLA, we expanded our model from the millimeter wavelength range to the centimeter wavelength range. This expansion demonstrates the opacity effect, which is reduced in the centimeter wavelength range, causing us to observe the lines in emission. Using our model, we reproduced the population inversion causing maser emission of methanol 44 GHz and 95 GHz transitions.",

However, there is a discrepancy in the ratio of the singly deuterated methanol isotopologues, CH2DOH/CH3OD, between low- and high-mass protostars, which puts into question whether prestellar isotopic ratios are generally preserved during the star- and planet-forming process. Resolving this puzzle is only made harder by the complete lack of data on this ratio in the prestellar stage. This work presents observations with the IRAM 30m telescope that securely detect CH3OD in the prestellar core L1448 in Perseus and tentatively in B213-C6 in Taurus. This work constrains the ratio of CH2DOH/CH3OD and the D/H ratios for both singly deuterated methanol isotopologues for the first time at the prestellar stage. Column densities calculated under the assumption of local thermal equilibrium lead to a CH2DOH/CH3OD ratio of 2.8-8.5 in L1448 and $\\leq$ 5.7 in B213-C6. The values are marginally consistent with the statistically expected ratio of 3, but most assumptions put the values in an elevated range in line with values found around low-mass protostars. The D/H ratio in CH2DOH is between 3.6% and 6.8% in L1448 and in the range of 2.4-5.8% in B213-C6. The D/H ratio derived for CH3OD is lower, namely 1.4-4.4% in L1448 and $\\leq$ 3.8% in B213-C6.",

We estimated the observational uncertainties on the quasar's position using astrometric data from the Global Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics (GAIA) of field stars within the NIRCam images. We find that all six quasars are found within the central $\\sim 400$ pc of their host galaxy dust continuum and [CII] emission. Apparent offsets seen in rest-frame optical JWST observations are not detected in our ALMA data, suggesting they likely result from dust obscuration rather than a true physical separation between the SMBH and its host galaxy. Kinematic modeling of these data further reveals that none of the galaxies show evidence for recent merger activity, and most of the galaxies can be accurately modeled using a simple disk model. The lack of an offset supports theoretical models that predict that positional offset within these galaxies are either short-lived or intrinsically rare.",

While several 3D methods exist for modelling gas structures there has been less investigation into the more computationally demanding problem of 3D full spectrum fitting for stellar recoveries. This work introduces and compares two algorithms for this task: the Projected Nesterov Kaczmarz Reconstruction method (PNKR) and a version of the Bayes-LOSVD software which has been modified to account for spatial correlations. We aim to understand strengths and weaknesses of both algorithms and assess the impact of 3D methods for stellar inferences. We apply both recovery algorithms to a mock IFS data over a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range from 20-200 and evaluate the quality of the recoveries compared to the known ground truth. Accounting for spatial correlations in Bayes-LOSVD significantly improved the accuracy and precision of kinematic recoveries. 3D modelling with PNKR did not provide any significant improvement over 1D fits however, for SNR>40, PNKR did recover the most accurate kinematics overall. Additionally, by modelling the joint distribution over kinematics and populations, PNKR could successfully infer trends between these quantities e.g. inferring local metallicity-velocity trends, albeit with a significant bias on the absolute metallicity. Having demonstrated advantages of (i) 3D modelling with Bayes-LOSVD, and (ii) joint kinematic-population analyses with PNKR, we conclude that both methodological advances will prove useful for detecting and characterising stellar structures from IFS data.",

Kewley, Tiger Yu-Yang Hsiao, James Trussler 10 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in the ApJL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The detections of bright UV nitrogen emission lines in some high-redshift galaxies suggest unexpectedly high nitrogen-to-oxygen ratios ($\\log(\\rm N/O)\\gtrsim-1.0$) compared to local values ($\\log(\\rm N/O)\\gtrsim-1.5$) at similar metallicities ($12+\\log(\\rm O/H)\\lesssim8.0$). Although the presence of these `N-enhanced' galaxies indicates signatures of atypical chemical enrichment processes in the early universe, the prevalence of nitrogen enhancement in high-$z$ galaxies is unclear. So far, only $\\sim$10 $z>5$ galaxies have nitrogen abundance measurements, and they all suggest elevated N/O ratios. Do all high-redshift galaxies exhibit elevated N/O ratios, or are we simply missing `N-normal' galaxies whose nitrogen abundances follow the local N/O scaling relation? To tackle these questions, we calculate the detection limits of UV NIII] or NIV] lines in current JWST surveys CEERS and JADES, and compare them to predictions from both `N-enhanced' and `N-normal' AGN narrow-line region and H II region photoionization models. We find that CEERS can only detect galaxies with significant nitrogen enhancement ($\\log(\\rm N/O)\\gtrsim-0.4$), while JADES can only detect galaxies with moderately elevated N/O ratios compared to local values ($\\log(\\rm N/O)\\gtrsim-1.0$). Even for the deepest exposure in JADES, UV nitrogen lines produced by `N-normal' galaxies at $z>5$ are too faint and thus not detectable, making their nitrogen abundance unmeasurable. Our results suggest that the existing sample of galaxies with measurable nitrogen abundances at $z\\gtrsim5$ is incomplete and biased toward galaxies with significantly elevated N/O ratios. Deep ($t_{\\rm exp}\\sim40-500\\,$hours) spectroscopic surveys will be crucial for building a complete sample to study nitrogen enrichment mechanisms in the early universe.",

Accepted to ApJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Microlensing observations suggest that the mass distribution of free-floating planets (FFPs) follows a declining power-law with increasing mass. The origin of such distribution is unclear. Using a population synthesis framework, we investigate the formation channel and properties of FFPs, and compare the predicted mass function with observations. Assuming FFPs originate from planet-planet scattering and ejection in single star systems, we model their mass function using a Monte Carlo based planet population synthesis model combined with N-body simulations. We adopt a realistic stellar initial mass function, which naturally results in a large fraction of planetary systems orbiting low-mass stars. The predicted FFP mass function is broadly consistent with observation: it follows the observed power-law at higher masses ($10 \\lesssim m/M_\\oplus < 10^4$), while at lower masses ($0.1 < m/M_\\oplus \\lesssim 10$) it flattens, remaining marginally consistent with the lower bound of the observational uncertainties. Low-mass, close-in planets tend to remain bound, while Neptune-like planets at wide orbits dominate the ejected population due to their large Hill radii and shallow gravitational binding. We also compare the mass distribution of bound planets with microlensing observations and find reasonably good agreement with both surveys. Our model predicts $\\simeq 1.20$ ejected planets per star in the mass range of $0.33 < m/M_\\oplus < 6660$, with a total FFP mass of $\\simeq 17.98~M_\\oplus$ per star. Upcoming surveys will be crucial in testing these predictions and constraining the true nature of FFP populations.",

Yama Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Microlensing campaigns have a long history of observations covering the Galactic bulge, where thousands of detections have been obtained, including many exoplanetary systems. The Euclid Galactic Bulge Survey represents a unique opportunity to revisit a large number of past events and attempt the lens-source resolution of known events falling in the covered area. As the analysis of individual events requires non-negligible efforts, it is important to establish priorities among all possible targets, identifying those candidates with the higher chance for a successful resolution of the lens from the source and with the highest scientific interest. Drawing from the databases of the three main microlensing surveys (OGLE, MOA and KMTNet), we compile the complete catalog of past microlensing events in the Euclid survey footprint up to year 2023, containing 8081 entries. By re-modeling all events and cross-checking with Galactic models, we estimate the relative lens-source proper motions for all events. Taking into account all uncertainties, for each microlensing event we are able to estimate the probability that the lens is separated from the source by more than a given angular distance threshold. Hence, we rank all events by their resolution probability, providing additional useful information that will guide future analyses on the most promising candidates. A particular attention is dedicated to known planetary microlensing events.",

Seligman, Dušan Marčeta, Eloy Peña-Asensio 16 pages, 11 figures, resubmitted following reviewer reports to AAS Journals Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) In this paper we calculate the expected orbital elements, radiants, and velocities of Earth-impacting interstellar objects. We generate a synthetic population of $\\sim10^{10}$ interstellar objects with M-star kinematics in order to obtain $\\sim10^4$ Earth-impactors. The relative flux of impactors arriving from the direction of the solar apex and the galactic plane is enhanced by a factor of $\\sim2$ relative to the mean. The fastest impactors also arrive from these directions, although Earth-impactors are generally slower than objects in the overall population. This is because the Earth-impacting subset contains a higher fraction of low-eccentricity hyperbolic objects which are more strongly affected by gravitational focusing. Earth-impacting interstellar objects are more likely to have retrograde orbits close to the ecliptic plane. A selection effect makes the distribution of inclination of Earth-impacting interstellar objects uniform/sinusoidal at low/high perihelion distances. In turn, low perihelion impactors have higher impact probability towards the ecliptic plane. The overall impactor population therefore exhibits an intermediate inclination distribution between uniform and sinusoidal. The highest velocity impacts are most likely to occur in the spring when the Earth is moving towards the solar apex. However, impacts in general are more likely to occur during the winter when the Earth is located in the direction of the antapex. Interstellar objects are more likely to impact the Earth at low latitudes close to the equator, with a slight preference for the Northern hemisphere due to the location of the apex. These distributions are independent of the assumed interstellar object number density, albedos, and size-frequency distribution and are publicly available.",

If those satellites acquire or preserve orbital eccentricity, tidal dissipation could provide a long-lasting internal heat source, potentially creating urable environments (capable of enabling abiogenesis) in the absence of stellar radiation. We explore (i) whether moons remain bound to planets expelled by a core-collapse supernova, (ii) how the explosion reshapes their orbits, and (iii) under which circumstances tidal heating can sustain urable subsurface oceans. We carried out three-dimensional N-body simulations with an 8th-order Runge-Kutta scheme, modelling homologous stellar mass loss for progenitors of 10 M$_{\\odot}$. Post-explosion orbital elements of single moons and resonant moon systems were analysed, and tidal heating power was estimated with a constant phase-lag model for several tidal dissipation functions and moon densities. All simulated moons survive the supernova and remain bound to their planets. The explosion excites moon eccentricities up to $\\sim7\\times10^{-4}$ and $\\sim3\\times10^{-3}$ for single moons of planets with circular and eccentric orbits, respectively. For resonant pairs, an eccentricity of $\\leq2\\times10^{-2}$ is preserved. The semi-major axis of the moons changes by $\\leq0.2\\%$. For 12-15\\% of cases -- preferentially moons at $a\\leq15\\,R_{\\mathrm{planet}}$ and with $e\\geq10^{-3}$ -- the specific tidal heating power lies between 0.1 and 10 times what is estimated on Europa or Enceladus, sufficient to maintain liquid oceans beneath an ice crust. Eccentricity damping timescales exceed the age of the Solar System for $a\\geq10\\,R_{\\mathrm{planet}}$, implying billions of years of continuous heating on the moons. Such worlds represent promising targets for future searches for extraterrestrial life.",

Comments are welcome Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Population III stars supplied the first light and metals in the Universe, setting the pace of re-ionisation and early chemical enrichment. In dense haloes their evolution can be strongly influenced by the energy released when WIMPs annihilate inside the stellar core. We follow the evolution of a \\(20\\,M_\\odot\\) Population III model with the \\textsc{genec} code, adding a full treatment of spin dependent WIMP capture and annihilation. Tracks are calculated for six halo densities from \\(10^{8}\\) to \\(3\\times10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{GeV\\,cm^{-3}}\\) and three initial rotation rates between zero and \\(0.4\\,v/v_{\\mathrm{crit}}\\). As soon as the capture product reaches \\(\\rho_\\chi\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SD}}\\simeq2\\times10^{-28}\\,\\mathrm{GeV\\,cm^{-1}}\\), the dark-matter luminosity rivals hydrogen fusion, stretching the main-sequence lifetime from about ten million years to more than a gigayear. The extra time allows meridional circulation to smooth out differential rotation; a star that begins at \\(0.4\\,v/v_{\\mathrm{crit}}\\) finishes core hydrogen burning with near solid-body rotation and a helium core almost twice as massive as in the dark-matter-free case. Because the nuclear timescale is longer, chemically homogeneous evolution now sets in at only \\(0.2\\,v/v_{\\mathrm{crit}}\\), rather than the \\(\\gtrsim0.5\\,v/v_{\\mathrm{crit}}\\) required without WIMPs. For a star with \\(0.4\\,v/v_{\\mathrm{crit}}\\), the surface hydrogen fraction drops to \\(X\\!\\sim\\!0.27\\), helium rises to \\(Y\\!\\sim\\!0.73\\), and primary \\(^{14}\\mathrm N\\) increases by four orders of magnitude at He exhaustion. Moderate rotation combined with plausible dark-matter densities can therefore drive primordial massive stars towards long-lived, quasi-homogeneous evolution with distinctive chemical and spectral signatures.",

From the surprisingly massive black holes detected by LIGO/Virgo to highly ionized nebulae with peculiar enrichment patterns observed in galaxies at Cosmic Dawn, evidence is mounting that our understanding of massive-star populations at very low metallicity remains critically incomplete. The fundamental limitation is the hand nature has dealt us: only a few star-forming galaxies within $\\lesssim$1 Mpc can currently be resolved into individual stars, and none reach the extreme metallicities and star-formation intensities that characterized the early Universe. With an ultraviolet integral-field spectrograph aboard the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), this barrier will finally be broken. HWO will bring rare, actively star-forming, extremely metal-poor dwarf galaxies at $\\sim$10-20 Mpc such as I Zw 18 within reach of resolved UV-optical spectroscopy, providing our first direct, statistical view of individual massive stars and the feedback they drive at $>$30 $M_\\odot$ and $<$10% $Z_\\odot$. This science is deeply synergistic with many next-generation facilities, yet requires the unique combination of spatial resolution and UV/optical sensitivity that only HWO can provide. The massive star science enabled by HWO within the Local Volume represents a transformational advance in our ability to probe the earliest stellar populations - those that seeded the Milky Way and other galaxies with the first heavy elements, and paved the way for life in the transparent, reionized Universe we inhabit today.",

Accepted for publication in ApJS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Modeling unresolved turbulence in astrophysical gasdynamic simulations can improve the modeling of other subgrid processes dependent on the turbulent structure of gas: from flame propagation in the interiors of combusting white dwarfs to star formation and chemical reaction rates in the interstellar medium, and nonthermal pressure support of circum- and intergalactic gas. We present a simple method for modeling unresolved turbulence in hydrodynamic simulations via tracking its sourcing by local numerical dissipation and modeling its decay into heat. This method is physically justified by the generic property of turbulent flows that they dissipate kinetic energy at a rate set by the energy cascade rate from large scales, which is independent of fluid viscosity, regardless of its nature, be it physical or numerical. We calibrate and test our model against decaying supersonic turbulence simulations. Despite its simplicity, the model quantitatively reproduces multiple nontrivial features of the high-resolution turbulence run: the temporal evolution of the average small-scale turbulence, its dependence on spatial scale, and the slope and scatter of the local correlation between subgrid turbulent velocities, gas densities, and local compression rates. As an example of practical applications, we use our model in isolated galactic disk simulations to model locally variable star formation efficiency at the subresolution scale. In the supersonic, star-forming gas, the new model performs comparably to a more sophisticated model where the turbulent cascade is described by explicit subgrid terms. Our new model is straightforward to implement in many hydrodynamic codes used in galaxy simulations, as it utilizes already existing infrastructure to implicitly track the numerical dissipation in such codes.",

Ferreira 28 pages, 24 figures, accepted by A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The ringed disk around HL Tau stands out as the iconic signature of planet formation, but the origin of the substructures is still debated. The HL Tau system also drives a powerful bipolar wind, and we analyze its outermost component traced by CO emission, to determine the relationship of the flow with the disk and its substructures. We use ALMA observations of the ${}^{12}$CO (2-1) line at 1.3 mm, with 0.2 km/s and ~ 0.28\" resolution, conducted within the ALMA-DOT project. The channel maps and position-velocity diagrams show a rich structure of concatenated bubble- and arc-shaped features, whose size and distance from the source increase with velocity. The superposition of the features generates the apparent conical shape. The tomographic reconstruction of the morphology and kinematics of the red-shifted lobe suggests the presence of distinct nested shells having higher velocity and steeper velocity gradient for shells closer to the axis, rotating in the same sense of the disk. Such configuration can be justified by different classes of models. In this paper we compare the derived wind parameters with the predictions of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disk winds. Under this hypothesis, the launch radii of the three outermost shells are found to be at about the position of three adjacent dust rings in the disk at 58, 72 and 86 au. The wind may be capable of removing angular momentum from the outer disk, and we derive a magnetic lever arm of $\\lambda \\sim 4 - 5$, higher than that commonly adopted for MHD winds from these regions. Interpretations are discussed. The arrangement of the wind in nested shells with brighter emission rooted at the location of ring substructures could support the results of non-ideal MHD simulations according to which magnetic instabilities can generate the disk ring-gap system with a connected layered wind, alternatively to the action of yet undetected protoplanets.",

Catalogue will be available at CDS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Context: This research presents unsupervised machine learning and statistical methods to identify and analyze tidal tails in open star clusters using data from the Gaia DR3 catalog. Aims: We aim to identify member stars and to detect and analyze tidal tails in five open clusters, BH 164, Alessi 2, NGC 2281, NGC 2354, and M67, of ages between 60 Myr and 4 Gyr. These clusters were selected based on the previous evidence of extended tidal structures. Methods: We utilized machine learning algorithms such as Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and principal component analysis (PCA), along with statistical methods, to analyze the kinematic, photometric, and astrometric properties of stars. Key characteristics of tidal tails, including radial velocity, the color-magnitude diagram, and spatial projections in the tangent plane beyond the cluster's Jacobi radius, were used to detect them. We used N-body simulations to visualize and compare the observables with real data. Further analysis was done on the detected cluster and tail stars to study their internal dynamics and populations, including the binary fraction. We also applied the residual velocity method to detect rotational patterns in the clusters and their tails. Results: We identified tidal tails in all five clusters, with detected tails extending farther in some clusters and containing significantly more stars than previously reported (tails ranging from 40 to 100 pc, one to four times their Jacobi radius, with 100-200 tail stars). The luminosity functions of the tails and their parent clusters were generally consistent, and tails lacked massive stars. In general, the binary fraction was found to be higher in the tidal tails. Significant rotation was detected in M67 and NGC 2281 for the first time.",

Watts 5 pages, 3 figures, accepted by A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Disentangling the (co-)evolution of individual galaxy structural components remains a difficult task, owing to the inability to cleanly isolate light from spatially overlapping components. In this pilot study of PGC\\,044931, observed as part of the GECKOS survey, we utilise a VIRCAM $H$-band image to decompose the galaxy into five photometric components, three of which dominate by contributing $>50\\%$ of light in specific regions: a main disc, a boxy/peanut bulge, and a nuclear disc. When the photometric decompositions are mapped onto MUSE observations, we find remarkably good separation in stellar kinematic space. All three structures occupy unique locations in the parameter space of the ratio of the light-weighted stellar line-of-sight mean velocity and velocity dispersion ($\\rm{V}_{\\star}/\\sigma_{\\star}$), and the high-order stellar skew ($h_{3}$). These clear and distinct kinematic behaviours allow us to make inferences about the formation histories of the individual components from observations of the mean stellar ages and metallicities of the three components. A clear story emerges: the main disc built over a sustained and extended star formation phase, possibly partly fuelled by gas from a low-metallicity reservoir. Early on, that disc formed a bar that buckled and subsequently formed a nuclear disc in multiple and enriched star-formation episodes. This result is an example of how careful photometric decompositions, combined with spatially well-resolved stellar kinematic information, can help separate out age-metallicity relations of different components and therefore disentangle the formation history of a galaxy. The results of this pilot study can be extended to a differential study of all GECKOS survey galaxies to assert the true diversity of Milky Way-like galaxies.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present the results of the first systematic and dedicated high-resolution chemical analysis of the Thamnos substructure, a candidate relic of the process of hierarchical merger of the Milky Way. The analysis was perfomed in comparison with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) remnant, within the fully self-consistent and homogeneous framework established by the 'A Walk on the Retrograde Side' (WRS) project. We analysed high-resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio spectra obtained with UVES at VLT for 212 red giant branch stars classified as candidate members of Thamnos and GSE, based on selections in the space of the integrals of motion. We derived precise abundances for 16 atomic species. Compared to GSE, stars attributed to the Thamnos substructure are, on average, more metal-poor, yet most of them show higher [X/Fe] abundance ratios in several elements, such as Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Cu, Zn, as well as lower [Eu/Fe]. The majority of candidate Thamnos stars show chemical signatures more consistent with the in situ Milky Way halo rather than a typical low-mass accreted dwarf galaxy. Our findings are further supported by comparisons with tailored galactic chemical evolution models, which fall short in reproducing the observed enhancement in the $\\alpha$-elements, but are able to fit the more metal-poor component present in the Thamnos substructure. These results confirm a high level of contamination in the Thamnos substructure from the in situ population and to a lesser degree from GSE, while still leaving room for a genuine accreted population from a small disrupted dwarf galaxy.",

They often rely on spectroscopic measurements of the projected rotation velocities. These not only suffer from the unknown projection factor but tend to ignore additional line-profile broadening mechanisms aside from rotation, such as pulsations and turbulent motions near the stellar surface. This limits the accuracy of Veq distributions. We use asteroseismic measurements to investigate the distribution of the equatorial rotation velocity, its ratio with respect to the critical rotation velocity, and the specific angular momentum for several thousands of BAF-type stars, covering a mass range from 1.3M$_\\odot$ to 8.8M$_\\odot$ and almost the entire core-hydrogen burning phase. We rely on high-precision model-independent internal rotation frequencies, as well as on masses and radii from asteroseismology to deduce Veq, Veq/Vcrit, and J/M for 2937 gravity-mode pulsators in the Milky Way. The sample stars have rotation frequencies between almost zero and 33$\\mu$Hz, corresponding to rotation periods above 0.35d. We find that intermediate-mass stars experience a break in their J/M occurring in the mass interval $[2.3,2.7]\\,$M$_\\odot$. We establish unimodal Veq and Veq/Vcrit distributions for the mass range $[1.3,2.5[$M$_\\odot$, while stars with $M\\in[2.5,8.8]$M$_\\odot$ reveal some structure in their distributions. We find that the near-core rotation slows down as stars evolve, pointing to very efficient angular momentum transport. The kernel density estimators of the asteroseismic internal rotation frequency, equatorial rotation velocity, and specific angular momentum of this large sample of intermediate-mass field stars can conveniently be used for population synthesis studies and to fine-tune the theory of stellar rotation across the main sequence evolution.",

Remote measurement of the photosphere provides the magnetic surface boundary condition necessary for data-constrained 3D global coronal models. With one such model, we explore how the spatial resolution of the surface boundary condition influences the global properties of the magnetic field and coronal heating. Using spherical harmonic decomposition, we quantify how three different resolution simulations vary in the low and middle corona. Through examination of the magnetic field, the squashing factor, and the heating rate, we demonstrate that small-scale photospheric magnetic flux enhances heating across spatial regimes. We calculate 40% more heating in our best resolution simulation as compared to our base resolution. We describe a strong correlation between the structure of the magnetic field and structure of the heating rate in the low corona across resolutions. These results provide key information as to what more efficient, low-resolution models might inherently miss.

Sánchez 11 pages, 4 figures. Accepted for publication in MNRAS on 31 October 2025 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) $\\theta^1$ Ori E is a very young and relatively massive pre-main sequence (PMS) spectroscopic and eclipsing binary with nearly identical components. We analyze Échelle spectra of the system obtained over fifteen years and report 91 radial velocities measured from cross-correlating the observations with a suitable synthetic spectrum. The spectra of individual binary components are indistinguishable from each other, with a composite spectral type around G4 III. The projected equatorial velocity is estimated to be $v \\sin{i} = 32\\pm 3~km~s^{-1}$, consistent with rotational synchronization. We find that the circular orbit has $P_{\\rm orb} = 9.89522 \\pm 0.00003~d$, $K_1 = 83.36 \\pm 0.29~km~s^{-1}$, $K_2 = 84.57 \\pm 0.28~km~s^{-1}$, and $asini = 32.84\\pm0.08\\ R_\\odot$. The mass ratio is $q = 0.9856 \\pm 0.0047$, indicating nearly identical but significantly different masses. The systemic velocity of the binary, $\\gamma = 29.7 \\pm 0.2~km~s^{-1}$, is similar to that of other Trapezium members. Using Spitzer light curves and our results, we derive $M_1 = 2.755\\pm0.043\\ M_{\\odot}$, $M_2 = 2.720\\pm0.043\\ M_{\\odot}$, $R_1=6.26\\pm0.31R_{\\odot}$ and $R_2=6.25\\pm0.30R_{\\odot}$. Together with our estimate of the effective temperature, $T_{\\rm eff}=5150\\pm200\\ K$, a bolometric luminosity of $28.8\\pm4.6\\ L_{\\odot}$ is derived for each component. Compared to evolutionary models of PMS stars, the binary age turns out to be less than or equal to $\\sim 10^5$ years. Its components are probably the most massive stars known with masses determined with precision better than 2 percent, with both being PMS stars.",

Cidale 15 pages, 15 figures. Accepted for publication in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Massive stars play a fundamental role in galactic evolution through their strong stellar winds, chemical enrichment, and feedback mechanisms. Accurate modelling of their atmospheres and winds is critical for understanding their physical properties and evolutionary pathways. Traditional spectroscopic analyses often rely on the $\\beta$-law approximation for wind-velocity profiles, which may not capture the complexity of observed phenomena. This study aims to introduce and validate the grId of Stellar atmOSphere and hydrodynamiC modELs for massivE Stars (ISOSCELES), a grid-based framework for the quantitative spectroscopic analysis of massive stars. The project leverages hydrodynamic wind solutions derived from the m-CAK theory, including both fast and $\\delta$-slow solutions, to improve the accuracy of derived stellar and wind parameters. We constructed a comprehensive grid of models based on hydrodynamic wind solutions from the Hydwind code and synthetic spectral line profiles generated by the Fastwind code. The grid spans a broad parameter space covering OBA-type stars with solar metallicity. A semi-automatic fitting procedure was developed to analyse key spectral lines and derive the stellar and wind parameters. Applying ISOSCELES to six stars demonstrates its ability to reproduce observed spectral profiles with high fidelity. The $\\delta$-slow solution proved effective for two early-type B supergiants. The grid also highlights the difference of using the $\\beta$-law in modelling stellar winds compared with the m-CAK wind solutions. The ISOSCELES database represents a step forward in quantitatively analysing massive stars, offering an alternative to the $\\beta$-law approximation. Future work will address the inclusion of UV lines and metallicity effects to further refine its applicability across diverse stellar populations.",

On 2023 March 13, a halo CME, as seen from the Solar Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) and the Sun TErrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), gave rise to a strong SEP event. In this work, we aim to analyze this CME-driven shock from multiple spacecraft, using both remote sensing observations from STEREO-A/COR2 and in-situ data from Parker Solar Probe (PSP), Solar Orbiter (SolO), and Wind. In order to determine its direction of propagation and kinematic properties, we model the shock geometry using STEREO-A/COR2 and SoHO/LASCO/C3 observations as an expanding ellipsoid. The density compression ratio of the shock is determined by fitting the brightness profile from the coronagraphic images with that obtained from raytracing simulations of a double-Gaussian shock density profile. We compare physical quantities such as compression ratio and Alfvénic Mach number derived from remote sensing observations with in-situ measurements by PSP, SolO, STEREO-A, and Wind. From STEREO-A/COR2, we determine the compression ratio around the entire shock front in the corona, finding significant non-homogeneities that can impact the values found during in-situ crossings. Following the evolution of the parameters characterizing the CME from the source to space, we find that closer to the Sun, both the gas compression ratio and the Alfvénic Mach number remain almost constant, while they increase at larger radial distances. This indicates a non-trivial evolution of the shock parameters during its journey through the interplanetary space.",

Accepted for publication in ApJL. Comments are welcome Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Bipolar sunspots, or more generally, Bipolar Magnetic Regions, BMRs, are the dynamic magnetic regions that appear on the solar surface and are central to solar activity. One striking feature of these regions is that they are often tilted with respect to the equator, and this tilt increases with the latitude of appearance, popularly known as Joys law. Although this law has been examined for over a century through various observations, its physical origin is still not established. An attractive theory that has been put forward behind Joys law is the Coriolis force acting on the rising flux tube in the convection zone, which has been studied using the thin flux tube model. However, observational support for this theory is limited. If the Coriolis force is the cause of the tilt, then we expect BMRs to hold Joys law at their initial emergence on the surface. By automatically identifying the BMRs over the last two solar cycles from high resolution magnetic observations, we robustly capture their initial emergence signatures on the surface. We find that from their appearance, BMRs exhibit tilts consistent with Joys law. This early tilt signature of BMRs suggests that the tilt is developed underneath the photosphere, driven by the Coriolis force and helical convection, as predicted by the thin flux tube model. Considerable scatter around Joys law observed during the emergence phase, which reduces in the post emergence phase, reflects the interaction of the vigorous turbulent convection with the rising flux tubes in the near surface layer.",

Archival photometric and spectroscopic observations, and a new optical spectrum, confirm that FY Vul belongs to the Z Camelopardalis subclass of CVs. Our imagery, obtained by accumulating long exposures with amateur telescopes equipped with CMOS cameras, shows a prominent bow shock in the light of [O III] 5007 A, collisionally excited in front of the star as it passes through a relatively dense region in the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). FY Vul also lies near the edge of an extended faint Halpha-emitting nebula, which we interpret as a \"recombination wake,\" i.e., a Stromgren zone recombining after being photoionized by the star's ultraviolet radiation. FY Vul joins five other CVs known to be associated with optical bow shocks and off-center nebulae. All of them are characterized by luminous accretion disks, which drive fast winds into the ISM that produce the bow shocks.",

Talafha 22 pages, 10 figures; Solar Physics Journal, Accepted: 29 October 2025 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn) Understanding and predicting solar-cycle variability requires accounting for nonlinear feedbacks that regulate the buildup of the Sun's polar magnetic field. We present a simplified but physically grounded algebraic approach that models the dipole contribution of active regions (ARs) while incorporating two key nonlinearities: tilt quenching (TQ) and latitude quenching (LQ). Using ensembles of synthetic cycles across the dynamo effectivity range $\\lambda_R$, we quantify how these mechanisms suppress the axial dipole and impose self-limiting feedback. Our results show that (i) both TQ and LQ reduce the polar field, and together they generate a clear saturation (ceiling) of dipole growth with increasing cycle amplitude; (ii) the balance between LQ and TQ, expressed as $R(\\lambda_R) = \\mathrm{dev(LQ)}/\\mathrm{dev(TQ)}$, transitions near $\\lambda_R \\approx 12^\\circ$, with LQ dominating at low $\\lambda_R$ and TQ at high $\\lambda_R$; (iii) over $8^\\circ \\leq \\lambda_R \\leq 20^\\circ$, the ratio follows a shallow offset power law with exponent $n \\approx 0.36 \\pm 0.04$, significantly flatter than the $n=2$ scaling assumed in many surface flux--transport (SFT) models; and (iv) symmetric, tilt-asymmetric, and morphology-asymmetric AR prescriptions yield nearly identical $R(\\lambda_R)$ curves, indicating weak sensitivity to AR geometry for fixed transport. These findings demonstrate that nonlinear saturation of the solar cycle can be captured efficiently with algebraic formulations, providing a transparent complement to full SFT simulations. The method highlights that the LQ\\--TQ balance is primarily controlled by transport ($\\lambda_R$), not by active-region configuration, and statistically disfavors the SFT-based $1/\\lambda_R^{2}$ dependence.",

M. Keck Institute of Space Studies (KISS), California Institute of Technology Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Space weather is among the most powerful and least understood forces shaping planetary atmospheres. In our Solar System, we observe its effects directly: atmospheric escape, chemical disruption, and spectacular auroral displays. Yet for exoplanets, we lack the tools and data to comprehensively assess the impacts of space weather, especially invisible elements like stellar winds, coronal mass ejections, energetic particles, and variable interplanetary magnetic fields. This problem lies at the intersection of four key fields: heliophysics, planetary science, astrobiology, and astrophysics. In 2023--2025, experts from these four fields convened at the W. M. Keck Institute for Space Studies to explore pathways for advancing the study of exospace weather. Organizing the subject into five core themes -- planets and their stellar particle environments, stellar magnetism and space weather modeling, quasi-steady stellar winds, transient events, and programmatic pathways -- our team synthesized concepts from across relevant fields and identified a wide array of opportunities for progress. This report is the product of that effort. It assembles cross-disciplinary knowledge; highlights outstanding theoretical challenges; explores promising innovations in observation, modeling, methodology, and instrumentation; and makes recommendations for accelerating community-wide progress. Together, these lay out a path to transforming the challenging, yet tractable problem of exospace weather into a foundational element of our understanding exoplanetary systems, and our own Solar System, in their entirety.",

Using photometric data from the TESS Full-Frame-Images we have performed a transit search for exoplanets with post-main sequence hosts to search for the imprints of these impacts on the giant planet population. We detect 130 short period planets and candidates, thirty-three of which are newly discovered candidates, from a sample of \\Ntotal\\ post-main sequence stars spanning the evolutionary stages from the end of the main sequence to the bottom of the red giant branch. We measure an occurrence rate of $0.28 \\pm 0.04$% for short period giant planets orbiting post-main sequence stars. We also measure occurrence rates for two stellar sub-populations, measuring values of $0.35 \\pm 0.05$% for a sub-population representing the earliest stages of post-main sequence evolution and $0.11^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$% for a sub-population of more evolved stars. We show that the giant planet occurrence rate decreases with increasing stellar evolution stage, with a larger occurrence rate decrease observed for shorter period planets. Our results are clear evidence that the population of short period giant planets is being sculpted by the post-main sequence evolution of the host stars, and we conclude that this is most likely through the destruction of these giant planets through the increased strength of planet-star tidal interactions resulting in the rapid tidal decay of the planets' orbits.",

Initial conditions are chosen to represent a range of plasma states observed by the Helios spacecraft at 0.3 AU, including an amplitude-modulated Alfvén wave that nonlinearly drives a proton beam aligned with the magnetic field. We compare simulation results with solar wind data out to 1.5 AU and show that our model reproduces key observed features of proton beams on average, such as the radial evolution of the drift and the relative core-to-beam density ratio. These findings support the theory that the observed evolution of the proton beam drift in the solar wind is determined by kinetic instabilities. More broadly, our results indicate that the interplay between nonlinear Alfvén wave dynamics, expansion effects and kinetic instabilities plays a fundamental role in solar wind dynamics, with implications for interpreting solar wind heating rate estimates.",

Berta-Thompson Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Starspot-crossing events (SCEs) in exoplanet transit lightcurves are becoming increasingly common as we focus on cooler host stars and observe higher precision photometric and spectroscopic lightcurves. In this work we explore how these events affect our retrievals of transit depths, and the accuracy with which we can derive spot properties. We inject and recover synthetic SCEs in photometric lightcurves using starry. We find that for high signal-to-noise SCEs we constrain the spot longitudes tightly (>80% within 1 degree of the true value), but degeneracies complicate retrieving spot contrasts, radii and latitudes (within 17%, 19%, and 9 degrees respectively). On average the difference between injected and recovered transit depths is 0.78% or 78.3ppm. In most (80%) injections we recover the transit depth to within 0.6%. For transit depths inflated >1.3% by the Transit Light Source Effect (TLSE), fitting for a spot-crossing improves the transit depth retrieval over masking the SCE in >95% of cases. However, we find that for spots with small contrasts (<5%) and/or covering fractions (<2%), we are likely to over-correct for the TLSE, recovering a worse transit depth than simply masking. In addition, even when fitted, we find SCEs can inflate the uncertainties on recovered transit depths significantly, especially for JWST-like precisions. Finally, we determine how SCE observables can narrow the degenerate spot parameter space to provide useful priors for MCMC sampling, demonstrating this technique on a real SCE observed in Kepler-51d's lightcurve.",

Weinberg, Manfred Cuntz Accepted by the Astronomical Journal (AJ); 15 pages, including 9 figures and 1 table Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Earth-like planets in the habitable zone (HZ) of M-dwarfs have recently been targeted in the search for exomoons. We study the stability and lifetime of large (Luna-like) moons, accounting for the effects of 3-body interactions and tidal forces using the N-body simulator rebound and its extension library reboundx. We find that those moons have a notably different likelihood of existence (and, by implication, observability). Large moons orbiting Earth-like planets in the HZs of M4 and M2 dwarfs become unstable well before $10^7$ and $10^8 \\textrm{ yr}$, respectively, and in most cases, those orbiting M0-dwarfs become unstable in much less than $10^9 \\textrm{ yr}$. We conclude that HZ planets orbiting M-dwarfs are unlikely to harbor large moons, thus affecting the total number of possible moons in our galaxy and the Universe at large. Since moons may help enhance the habitability of their host planet, besides being possibly habitable themselves, these results may have notable implications for exolife, and should also be considered when seeking solutions to the Drake equation and the Fermi paradox.",

Cohen Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) This chapter provides an overview of the magnetic activity of the Sun and stars, discussing its underlying physical origin, manifestations, and fundamental role in exoplanet studies. It begins with a summary of the Sun's magnetic activity from the surface towards the outer atmospheric layers, highlighting features such as sunspots, faculae, chromospheric structures, and their temporal modulation known as the activity cycle. These phenomena are sustained throughout the lifetime of the Sun by the magnetic dynamo, which is driven by differential rotation and convective flows. Furthermore, extending these concepts to other stars, the chapter examines the diagnostics that are typically employed to track and quantify the magnetic activity level of stars, and it reviews spectropolarimetry, an observational technique with which to characterise stellar magnetic fields. We finally outline results from both observations and theoretical modelling of stellar activity across distinct spectral types, and we describe the variety of methods used to search for stellar activity cycles, underscoring the multi-wavelength nature of this field of research.",

Our analysis reveals an overall zero-point offset between the 2016 and 2013 datasets. We further identify zero-point offsets for each standard field, ranging from 5 -- 14 mmag across all $UBVRI$ bands, with correlations between offsets in different bands. Additionally, we confirm the spatial structures up to 7 -- 10 mmag in the $BVRI$ bands. We also find that spatial structures are similar across bands for the same field, and similar across different fields for the same band. These similarities may arise from the averaged flat-fields from each observing run. The recalibrated results are consistent with the XPSP data within 48 mmag in the $U$ band, 11 mmag in the $B$ band, and 5 -- 6 mmag in the $VRI$ bands in the brightness $G<16$. Furthermore, based on stellar atmospheric parameters from LAMOST DR12 and Gaia DR3 photometry, along with the XPSP data, we derive temperature- and extinction-dependent extinction coefficients for the $UBVRI$ bands as well as a LAMOST \\& Gaia-based catalog of 5.4 million standard stars in the $UBVRI$ bands, for which the U-band photometry of the vast majority of sources exhibits significantly higher precision than XPSP. The recalibrated Landolt standard stars and LAMOST \\& Gaia-based standard stars will be available on the BEST website (this https URL) and (this https URL).",

A member of the Sco-Cen star-forming region with an age of $13 \\pm 4$ Myr, HD~143811~AB is somewhat rare among hosts of directly imaged planets as it is a close stellar binary, with an $\\sim$18 day period. Accurate values for the orbital and stellar parameters of this binary are needed to understand the formation and evolutionary history of the planet in orbit. We utilize archival high-resolution spectroscopy from FEROS on the MPG/ESO 2.2-meter telescope to fit the orbit of the binary, and combine with unresolved photometry to derive the basic stellar properties of the system. From the orbit, we derive precise values of orbital period of $18.59098 \\pm 0.00007$ days, and mass ratio of $0.885 \\pm 0.003$. When combined with stellar evolutionary models, we find masses of both components of $M_A = 1.30^{+0.03}_{-0.05}$ M$_\\odot$ and $M_B = 1.15^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ M$_\\odot$. While the current data are consistent with the planet and stellar orbits being coplanar, the 3D orientations of both systems are currently poorly constrained, with additional observations required to more rigorously test for coplanarity.",

The architecture integrates a metallic magnetic microcalorimeter (MMC) array of paramagnetic absorber pads with a thin layer of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond for simultaneous optical readout. An impinging X-ray photon induces a temperature transient in an absorber pad, kept at ~35 mK. This time- and temperature-dependent magnetic field transient is then optically imaged by diamond NV centers, kept at 4 K and positioned directly below the pad. For a 10 $\\mu$m absorber length used with a 12 m focal length telescope, our design yields an optimal angular resolution of ~0.17 arcseconds and energy resolution of ~0.70 eV. Our NV-MMC design improves upon current transition-edge sensors (TES) or MMCs read-out by superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID) by enabling simultaneous optical readout of the entire MMC array. Because no additional cryogenic multiplexing electronics are required, our approach scales naturally to larger and finer arrays, supporting finer angular resolutions and wider fields of view.",

This effect results in an elongated image at the focal plane of a telescope and diminishes fiber coupling efficiency into spectrographs. We propose an optical design that incorporates a Rotational Atmospheric Dispersion Corrector (RADC) to address the broadband dispersion encountered in the multi-object mode of the High-Resolution Optical Spectrograph (HROS) on the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT). The RADC corrects the dispersion across the entire wavelength range (0.31-1 micron), using Amici prisms optimized for over 90% transmission efficiency and minimal angular deviation of the beam from the optical axis after dispersion correction. For enhanced accuracy, particularly in the blue region, we have, for the first time, implemented the Filippenko (1982) model in Zemax via a custom Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) file.",

Zvezdov Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We present a fast data processing system for the Baikal-GVD neutrino telescope, designed for rapid identification of astrophysical neutrino events. Leveraging Baikal-GVD's modular cluster architecture, the system implements parallelized file processing where raw data files undergo concurrent analysis across dedicated virtual machines. The system implements two pipelines: a fast per-file processing and a fully fledged (per-run) processing, which integrates dynamic detector geometry determined from acoustic and inertial positioning systems and data quality monitoring with a latency of about 27 hr. The fast processing pipeline delivers a total latency of about 1.5-18 minutes from event detection to reconstructed data availability, depending on water luminescence levels. This enables fast follow-up observations of transient astrophysical sources, fulfilling Baikal-GVD's role in multi-messenger networks. The article also highlights key features of the data acquisition system, the integration of advanced synchronization systems and a robust infrastructure for data handling and storage, ensuring efficient and reliable operation of the Baikal-GVD telescope.",

Kühn, Laura Perez, Gael Chauvin Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) High-contrast imaging relies on advanced coronagraphs and adaptive optics (AO) to attenuate the starlight. However, residual aberrations, especially non-common path aberrations between the AO channel and the coronagraph channel, limit the instrument performance. While post-processing techniques such as spectral or angular differential imaging (ADI) can partially address those issues, they suffer from self-subtraction and inefficiencies at small angular separations or when observations are conducted far from transit. We previously demonstrated the on-sky performance of coherent differential imaging (CDI), which offers a promising alternative. It allows for isolating coherent starlight residuals through speckle modulation, which can then be subtracted from the raw images during post-processing. This work aims to validate a CDI method on real science targets, demonstrating its effectiveness in imaging almost face-on circumstellar disks, which are typically challenging to retrieve with ADI. We temporally modulated the speckle field in VLT/SPHERE images, applying small phase offsets on the AO deformable mirror while observing stars surrounded by circumstellar material: HR 4796A, CPD-36 6759, HD 169142, and HD 163296. We hence separated the astrophysical scene from the stellar speckle field, whose lights are mutually incoherent. Combining a dozen of data frames and reference coronagraph point spread functions through a Karhunen-Loève image projection framework, we recover the circumstellar disks without the artifacts that are usually introduced by common post-processing algorithms (e.g., self-subtraction). The CDI method therefore represents a promising strategy for calibrating the effect of static and quasi-static aberrations in future direct imaging surveys. Indeed, it is efficient, does not require frequent telescope slewing, and does not introduce image artifacts to first order.",

Comments are welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) While the nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains unknown, population-level analyses can elucidate underlying structure in these signals. In this study, we employ deep learning methods to both classify FRBs and analyze structural patterns in the latent space learned from the first CHIME catalog. We adopt a Supervised Variational Autoencoder (sVAE) architecture which combines the representational learning capabilities of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with a supervised classification task, thereby improving both classification performance and the interpretability of the latent space. We construct a learned latent space in which we perform further dimensionality reduction to find underlying structure in the data. Our results demonstrate that the sVAE model achieves high classification accuracy for FRB repeaters and reveals separation between repeater and non-repeater populations. Upon further analysis of the latent space, we observe that dispersion measure excess, spectral index, and spectral running are the dominant features distinguishing repeaters from non-repeaters. We also identify four non-repeating FRBs as repeater candidates, two of which have been independently flagged in previous studies.",

Gressel Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph) The stability of a differentially rotating fluid subject to its own gravity is a problem with applications across wide areas of astrophysics--from protoplanetary discs (PPDs) to entire galaxies. The shearing box formalism offers a conceptually simple framework for studying differential rotation in the local approximation. Aimed at self-gravitating, and importantly, vertically stratified PPDs, we develop two novel methods for solving Poisson's equation in the framework of the shearing box with vertical vacuum boundary conditions (BCs). Both approaches naturally make use of multi-dimensional fast Fourier transforms for computational efficiency. While the first one exploits the linearity properties of the Poisson equation, the second, which is slightly more accurate, consists of finding the adequate discrete Green's function (in Fourier space) adapted to the problem at hand. To this end, we have revisited the method proposed by Vico et al. (2016) and have derived an analytical Green's function satisfying the shear-periodic BCs in the plane as well as vacuum BCs, vertically. Our spectral method demonstrates excellent accuracy, even with a modest number of grid points, and exhibits third-order convergence. It has been implemented in the NIRVANA-III code, where it exhibits good scalability up to 4096 CPU cores, consuming less than 6% of the total runtime. This was achieved through the use of P3DFFT, a fast Fourier Transform library that employs pencil decomposition, overcoming the scalability limitations inherent in libraries using slab decomposition. We have introduced two novel spectral Poisson solvers that guarantees high accuracy, performance, and intrinsically support vertical vacuum boundary conditions in the shearing-box framework. Our solvers enable high-resolution local studies involving self-gravity, such as MHD simulations of gravito-turbulence or gravitational fragmentation.",

Gressel Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph) Planet-forming discs often contain structures like spiral arms, typically linked to the disc's gravitational forces. In 2D models, an ad hoc softening prescription is commonly used for self-gravity, but this overlooks the vertical structure's impact, suppresses the Newtonian nature of gravity at short distances and doesn't respect Newton's third law. To address these issues, associated with a Plummer potential approximation, we developed an exact self-gravity kernel for thin, hydrostatically supported discs, including a dust fluid component. Our analytical framework provides a precise 2D self-gravity prescription validated by benchmarks and 2D/3D numerical tests. The derived kernel, based on modified Bessel functions, maintains Newtonian gravitation features, such as point-wise symmetry, a smooth transition from light to massive discs and a singularity at zero distance, among others. In contrast to other prescriptions found in the literature, it proves capable of leading to an additional, and previously unnoticed, source of gravitational runaway discernible only at infinitesimal distances. We finally note that our new prescription remains compatible with methods based on the fast Fourier transform, affording superior computational efficiency. Our exact kernel formulation overcomes substantial limitations inherent in the smoothing-length approach. It permits a novel, fully consistent treatment of self-gravity in Gaussian-stratified thin discs. The approach, that makes the usage of the Plummer potential obsolete, will prove useful to studying all common planet formation scenarios, which are often backed by 2D-flat numerical simulations. Accordingly, in an accompanying paper, we will investigate how the occurence of the gravitational instability is affected.",

      "abstract": "High-inclination Centaur reservoirs beyond Neptune Fathi Namouni 10 pages, 13 figures. Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) (Abridged) Numerical simulations of the past evolution of high-inclination Centaurs showed they originated from orbits beyond Neptune that were perpendicular to the Solar System's invariable plane in a region called the polar corridor. Recently, a study of Centaur injection in the three-body problem showed that Neptune-crossing TNOs in the polar corridor in the range [40:160] au have dynamical times that exceed the Solar System's age suggesting the presence of long-lived Centaur-producing reservoirs. We demonstrate the existence of such reservoirs in the Solar System by simulating the TNOs' time-forward evolution in the presence of the giant planets, the Galactic tide and passing stars using the IAS15 integrator of the REBOUND and REBOUNDx packages. We also assess the efficiency of Centaur injection as a function of the initial inclination and determine if high-inclination Centaurs may be produced by low inclination reservoirs. We find that TNO reservoirs in the semi-major axis range [50:140] au are long-lived and their populations peak at the Tisserand parameters T=0.5 and T=-1.5. Saturn is found to induce secondary structures in the polar corridor by holding the perihelia of a fraction of high-inclination reservoir material. We find that the Centaur inclination at minimum semi-major axis depends linearly on the Tisserand parameter regardless of the initial semi-major axis. Its amplitude shows that low inclination reservoirs such as the early protoplanetary disk are unlikely to produce high-inclination Centaurs in contrast to reservoirs in the polar corridor. We identified the likely location of the closest reservoirs to Neptune populated by TNOs captured in the early Solar System that produce high-inclination Centaurs. The Legacy Survey of Space and Time will be able to constrain the reservoirs' extent and population size",

Traditional Earth-Moon transfers suffer from rigid launch windows and high propellant demands, while Earth-based GNSS systems provide little to no coverage beyond geostationary orbit. This limits autonomy and environmental awareness in cislunar space. This review compares four major transfer strategies by evaluating velocity requirements, flight durations, and fuel efficiency, and by identifying their suitability for both crewed and robotic missions. The emerging role of artificial intelligence and machine learning is highlighted: convolutional neural networks support automated crater recognition and digital terrain model generation, while deep reinforcement learning enables adaptive trajectory refinement during descent and landing to reduce risk and decision latency. The study also examines how GNSS-Reflectometry and advanced Positioning, Navigation, and Timing architectures can extend navigation capabilities beyond current limits. GNSS-R can act as a bistatic radar for mapping lunar ice, soil properties, and surface topography, while PNT systems support autonomous rendezvous, Lagrange point station-keeping, and coordinated satellite swarm operations. Combining these developments establishes a scalable framework for sustainable cislunar exploration and long-term human and robotic presence.",

In this paper we report photometric observations of 3I/ATLAS from the nights of UT 2025 July 3, UT 2025 July 9, and UT 2025 July 10 obtained with the Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope (SOAR). The photometric observations are taken with the Goodman High Throughput Spectrograph (HTS) in the $r'$-band. These data provide 28 photometric data points to the rapidly growing composite light curve of 3I/ATLAS. They reveal that the object did not exhibit obvious long-term variability in its brightness when these observations were taken. These observations appear to have captured two moderate and independent brightening events on UT 2025 July 9, and UT 2025 July 10. However, we perform a series of stellar contamination, stacking, and aperture experiments that demonstrate that the increases in brightness by $\\sim0.8$ magnitudes appear to be a result of poor seeing and stellar contamination by close-proximity field stars. We report the mean brightnesses of 3I/ATLAS on each night of magnitude 18.14, 17.55, and 17.54 for UT 2025 July 3, 9, and 10, respectively. Moreover, the presence of cometary activity in extant images obtained contemporaneously with these data precludes them from revealing insights into the rotation of the nucleus.
