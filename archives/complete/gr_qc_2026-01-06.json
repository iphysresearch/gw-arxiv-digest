      "abstract": "From Rotating Attractors to Extremal Black Holes with Axionic Hair Etevaldo dos Santos Costa Filho General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We study extremal, rotating black holes in four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-axion (EMA) theory through a combined near-horizon and bulk analysis. At the level of the near-horizon extremal geometry (NHEG), using the entropy function formalism, we prove that regular rotating attractors with axionic hair exist only for configurations that are purely electrically or purely magnetically charged; regular rotating dyonic attractors are excluded by the axion equation of motion, a result that we established perturbatively and non-perturbatively within the NHEG system. On the global side, we construct families of asymptotically flat, rotating extremal EMA black holes that interpolate to the electric NHEG branch, confirming that horizon data are fixed by extremization of the entropy function and decoupled from asymptotic moduli in line with the attractor mechanism.",

      "abstract": "Gravitation and Spacetime: Emergent from Spinor Interactions -- How? Martin Rainer Paper presented at the conference \"Modern Trends in Physics 2025\" at Baku State University, 16 pages, 3 figures General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Newtonian gravity arises as the nonrelativistic, static, weak-field limit of some Lorentzian spacetime geometry solving the generally covariant Einstein equations for a given matter field configuration. Spacetime geometry has a local description in the spinor basis of Penrose. The breakdown of relativistic quantum (field) theory at small distances suggests that, the Lorentzian geometry is to be modified below some regularization length. The thermodynamic correspondence, e.g. for black holes or other horizons, indicates that, Lorentzian spacetime is an emergent geometric description of an ensemble of more fundamental constituents. The independent derivations of the area law of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy by string theory and loop quantum gravity show that, (some) properties of spacetime do not depend on the nature of its fundamental constituents (in leading order). Whether, on a fundamental scale, spacetime gravity has its own classical or quantum constituents (like e.g. in loop quantum gravity), or it is just an effective theory, deriving from expectation values of quantum matter operators (like in spinor gravity or causal fermion systems), this is still open. We compare some very different classical and quantum approaches to spacetime geometry, all deriving in one way or another from spinors, and comment on questions for future research in order to clarify their relations. We propose that both, the causal structure and the spin networks for generation of discrete geometry arise via projection from all particle spinors (fermionic and bosonic) within a causal double cone region and their spin interwining interaction events onto a spatial section of this double cone region.",

This requires a perturbation framework that extends beyond General Relativity, as well as an appropriate method for reconstructing the spacetime metric. In this work, we address these challenges within the context of general spherically symmetric spacetimes. We introduce a modified Teukolsky equation for perturbative calculations in asymptotically flat, spherically symmetric spacetimes. The metric reconstruction method, which does not rely on the Hertz potential, is extended to $tr$-symmetric spacetime, allowing for the calculation of metric components under specific gauge conditions. Additionally, we present a second-order perturbation theory applicable to generic spherically symmetric spacetimes.",

Using extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) as high-precision probes, we investigate the imprints of this LQG deformation in the surrounding spacetime. Waveforms generated via an improved augmented analytic kludge (AAK) model in both LQG-BH backgrounds and in Schwarzschild spacetime are compared through a faithfulness analysis. This allows us to quantify the detectability of the deviation with LISA and to derive constraints on $\\zeta$ based on a detection threshold. We find that the first LQG-BH model produces significantly stronger signatures in EMRI signals than the second, making its quantum gravity effects more accessible to future space-borne gravitational-wave detection.",

Shekh General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this study, we analyze the ghost dark energy model in Brans-Dicke cosmology in the framework of a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe. We consider an interaction between ghost dark energy and dark matter with a sign-changeable interaction term. To discuss the cosmological implications of the model, we consider a well-motivated logarithmic form of the Brans-Dicke scalar field. By deriving the cosmological evolution equations, we obtain the cosmological parameters such as the equation of state and deceleration parameters. We analyze the behavior of the cosmological parameters by plotting their graphs against the redshift parameter ($z$). We observe that the equation of state parameter shows quintessence-like behaviour during present and future epochs; however, phantom-like behavior is also possible for suitable values of the model parameters. Analysis of the deceleration parameter shows a smooth recent phase transition of the universe (deceleration to acceleration). An interesting result we observe is the decelerated expansion of the universe in the far future, i.e, the universe experiences another phase transition in the future. The physical significance of the well-known cosmological plane ($w_D-w_D'$ plane) is discussed in our model. We observe that the trajectories start in the freezing region with the same initial behavior, deviate from each other during the evolution and ends in the thawing region. Finally, we perform a detailed thermodynamic analysis and demonstrate that the generalized second law of thermodynamics is satisfied within the present interacting ghost dark energy model.",

Here, we used a two-fluid approach to de Sitter thermodynamics and found a collective mode that is analogous to second sound in the two-fluid dynamics of the de Sitter state. This mode is massless and propagates at the speed of light. This suggests that this second-sound analog is a massless graviton propagating in de Sitter spacetime. The type of graviton this mode represents requires further consideration.",

We find that the EL appears in the parameter space spanned by the scalar mass and the black hole spin parameter, and also in the Nariai limit, i.e., $r_{\\rm c} - r_{\\rm h} \\to 0$, where $r_{\\rm c}$ and $r_{\\rm h}$ denote the radii of the cosmological and black hole horizons, respectively. We analytically study the amplitudes or excitation factors of QNMs near the EL. Such an analytic treatment becomes possible since, in the Nariai limit, the perturbation equation reduces to a wave equation with the Pöschl-Teller (PT) potential. We discuss the destructive excitation of QNMs and the stability of the ringdown near and at the EL. The transient linear growth of QNMs -- a characteristic excitation pattern near an EP or EL -- together with the conditions under which this linear growth dominates the early ringdown, is also studied analytically. Our conditions apply to a broad class of systems that involve the excitation of (nearly) double-pole QNMs.",

Recent progress has shown that, by treating higher-derivative operators as perturbations, the first-order corrections to black hole thermodynamics can be obtained without explicit knowledge of the corresponding perturbed black hole solutions. This result can be understood as a consequence of an extremalization principle underlying the Euclidean action formulation of black hole thermodynamics. In this work, we emphasize that this extremalization approach is not restricted to perturbations around Einstein gravity. Instead, it can be applied to perturbations of more general higher-derivative gravity theories whose black hole solutions are already known and can be taken as the zeroth-order background. As an explicit illustration, we consider Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet gravity as the zeroth-order theory and study the first-order thermodynamic corrections induced by further higher-order curvature operators. We show that these corrections can be derived without solving the perturbed black hole solutions, both in asymptotically flat and asymptotically AdS spacetimes.",

This is verified in the case of a black hole with or without an electric or a magnetic charge and in a background with or without a cosmological constant. Moreover, a new quasilocal prescription is proposed and tested, where the black hole partition function is determined solely by the horizon boundary term, yielding the correct Helmholtz free energy without the need for counterterms.",

Periodic orbits Yi-Ping Chen, Tien Hsieh, Da-Shin Lee General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The motion of a spinning particle in the exterior of a Kerr-Newman black hole is studied. The dynamics is governed by the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations in the pole-dipole approximation, including the spin-curvature coupling to leading order in the spin. In terms of conserved quantities, the dynamical equations in Mino time can be transformed into the integral form for both aligned and misaligned spins with respect to the orbital motion. These non-geodesic equations can be solved analytically with the solutions involving Jacobi elliptic functions. The radial potential is derived to study the particle's parameter space for various types of orbits, based on its roots corrected by the particle's spin. We consider equatorial motion oscillating between two turning points, which are the two outermost roots of the radial potential, in the misaligned case. In this case, there is an induced oscillatory motion out of the equatorial plane. In particular, the periods of the motion are obtained explicitly. When the orbits become a source of gravitational-wave emission, these periods of motion will play a key role in determining gravitational-wave signals in the frequency domain. Numerical kludge waveforms are constructed. The gravitational-wave amplitudes are found to be sensitive to the turning points of the orbits. The implications for gravitational-wave emission due to extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Holographic dark energy in modified Kaniadakis cosmology A. Sheykhi, A. Asvar, E. Ebrahimi General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) It is well-known that any modification to the entropy expression not only change the energy density of the holographic dark energy, but also modifies the cosmological field equations through thermodynamics-gravity correspondence. Here we propose a Kaniadakis holographic dark energy (KHDE) in the background of the modified Kaniadakis cosmology by incorporating the effects of Kaniadakis entropy into the Friedmann equations. We choose the Hubble radius, $L=H^{-1}$, as system's IR cutoff and determine the cosmological implications of this model. We first consider a dark energy (DE) dominated universe and reveal that this model mimics the cosmological constant with $w_{DE}=-1$. This implies that the theoretical origin of the cosmological constant, $\\Lambda$, may be understood through KHDE in the context of Kaniadakis cosmology. Remarkably, we observe that in the absence of interaction between DE and dark matter (DM), and in contrast to HDE in standard cosmology, our model can explain the current acceleration of the cosmic expansion for the Hubble radius as IR cutoff. When the interaction between DE and DM is taken into account, we see that the total equation of state parameter (EoS), $w_{tot}=p_{tot}/\\rho_{tot}$ can cross the phantom line at the present time. We also analyze the squared speed of sound, $v_s^2$, for this model and find out that $(v_s^2<0)$ for interacting KHDE.

This inequality provides a lower bound for the ADM mass in terms of the area and angular momentum of the black hole horizon, with equality holding if and only if the initial data set corresponds to a slice of the Kerr spacetime. Our proof combines the Jang equation approach with the p-harmonic level set method. A key component of the analysis is a modified Hawking mass functional that incorporates angular momentum and exhibits monotonicity along the flow.

The usual association of gravitational waves with transverse and traceless fluctuations of the metric on spatial hypersurfaces becomes ambiguous at second order, as it inherently depends on the spacetime slicing. While this poses no practical issues in linearized gravity, it presents a fundamental problem for secondary gravitational waves, especially notorious for gravitational waves induced by primordial fluctuations. We compute, for the first time, the physical effects of gravitational waves at second order, as measured by geodesic observers that emit and receive electromagnetic signals, thereby settling the debate on gauge ambiguities. We find that the measured gravitational wave strain coincides with the transverse-traceless components in the Newton gauge.",

We evaluate their detectability by combining various theoretical and observational arguments from the literature and systematically applying those arguments to known astronomical objects and future gravitational wave detectors. We detail and update previous estimates made in support of Cosmic Explorer [M. Evans et al., arXiv:2306.13745; I. Gupta et al., Class. Quantum Grav. 41, 245001 (2024)]. It is commonly argued that the spins of accreting neutron stars are regulated by gravitational wave emission and that millisecond pulsars contain a young pulsar's magnetic field buried under accreted material. If either of these arguments holds, the first detection of continuous gravitational waves is likely with near future upgrades of current detectors, and many detections are likely with next generation detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. A lack of detections in the next several years would begin to raise serious doubts about current theories of millisecond pulsar formation.",

Phys General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Continuous gravitational waves from rapidly rotating neutron stars are on the new frontiers of gravitational wave astrophysics and have strong connections to electromagnetic astronomy, nuclear astrophysics, and condensed matter physics. In this Colloquium I survey prospects for detection of continuous gravitational waves from various neutron star populations, especially aided by electromagnetic observations. Although there are caveats, current theories and observations suggest that the first detections are likely within a few years, and that many are likely in the era of next generation detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. I also survey what can be learned from these signals, each one of which will contain more cycles than all the compact binary mergers ever detected. Since continuous gravitational wave emission mechanisms depend on aspects of neutron star physics, such as crustal elasticity, which are not well constrained by current astronomical observations and physical experiments, their detection can tell us a great deal that is new about extreme matter. Even more can be learned by combining gravitational wave observations with data from the Square Kilometre Array, the Next Generation Very Large Array, FAST, and other electromagnetic detectors operating in the next generation era.",

We investigate the LTABH spacetime geometry, showing that the roots of the metric function determine a partition of the spacetime into four regions, depending on the acoustic parameter $\\xi $ (whereas the dependence vanishes for the rotation parameter $a$); on the other hand, the parameter $a$ turns out to affect the critical radii associated to the maxima of the effective potential. All in all, both the acoustic sphere radius $r_{as}$ and the photon sphere radius $r_{ps}$, respectively giving rise to the acoustic shadow $R_{as}$ and to the optical shadow $R_{s}$, depend on $\\xi $ and $a$. More precisely, the rotation parameter $a$ is more relevantly affecting $R_{s}$ (through a right shift), while $R_{as}$ retains its circular shape. For what concerns the acoustic parameter, we notice that the higher $\\xi $ is, the larger the size of both shadows. All of these results are confirmed through a detailed analysis of the distortions and of the shadows radii. Moreover, by deriving the magnitude of the precession frequency $\\Omega $, we observe that it significantly increases near the acoustic horizons, both in the extremal and in the non-extremal cases, which implies that the Lense-Thirring (frame dragging) effect, which can be traced back to $\\xi $ itself, becomes important near such regions. On the other hand, we also show that there are regions of the LTABH spacetime in which $% \\Omega $ vanishes, suggesting that therein possible probe particles would not be affected by the frame dragging at all. Finally, we derive the deflection of the light near the LTABH.",

Vinodkumar General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We investigate the impact of pressure anisotropy on the structural and geometric properties of neutron stars within general relativity, focusing primarily on the phenomenological Bowers-Liang (BL) model, and comparing selected results with a quasi-local prescription. Using the SLy equation of state, we explore how anisotropic stresses modify global observables such as the mass-radius relation, moment of inertia, compactness, and tidal deformability over a broad range of anisotropy parameters. We find that moderate positive anisotropy can increase the maximum supported mass up to approximately $2.4\\;M_\\odot$ and enhance stellar compactness by up to $20\\%$ relative to isotropic configurations, while remaining broadly consistent with current NICER and gravitational-wave constraints. To probe the internal gravitational field, we compute curvature invariants including the Ricci scalar, the Ricci tensor contraction, the Kretschmann scalar, and the Weyl scalar. We show that curvature measures directly tied to the matter distribution exhibit a strong sensitivity to anisotropy, whereas the Weyl curvature remains comparatively insensitive, reflecting its role as a measure of the free gravitational field. Within the phenomenological BL framework, the maximum compactness increases with anisotropy and reaches values as high as $\\mathcal{C}_{\\max}\\approx 0.25$-$0.38$ for $\\lambda_{\\rm BL}\\in[-4,+4]$, although the physical realizability of such highly compact configurations depends sensitively on the underlying anisotropy mechanism. A comparison with the quasi-local model highlights the strong model dependence of anisotropic effects, underscoring both the potential significance and the limitations of phenomenological anisotropy prescriptions in modeling strong-field neutron-star interiors.",
