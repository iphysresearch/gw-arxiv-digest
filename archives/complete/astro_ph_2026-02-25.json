Burdge, Jorge Cuadra, Margherita Giustini, Lorena Hernández-García, Erin Kara, Paula Sánchez-Sáez, Philippe Yao High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We report the first direct measurement of the period derivative in a quasi-periodic eruption (QPE), finding a smoothly increasing period with $\\dot{P}\\approx (1.7\\pm 0.02)\\times10^{-2}$ d d$^{-1}$ in the source ZTF19acnskyy/\"Ansky\". Most models for QPEs invoke repeated interactions of a stellar-mass orbiting companion around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI). In these scenarios, a positive $\\dot{P}$ is surprising, but not impossible to produce. We explore several possible explanations for the observed $\\dot{P}$, including stable mass-transfer driven by impulsive mass loss events in an EMRI, velocity kicks at pericenter due to tidal interactions with the SMBH, apparent period changes due either to general relativistic precession effects in an EMRI or light travel-time delays in a hierarchical SMBH binary, and mass-transfer variations in a thermal/viscous disk instability model. We find that none of the considered models provides a complete explanation for the data, motivating further work on physical explanations for positive period derivatives in QPEs.",

Philcox Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We analyze the public DESI full-shape clustering data using simulation-based priors (SBPs). Our priors are obtained by fitting normalizing flows to the distribution of EFT parameters measured from field-level simulations, themselves generated using tailored halo occupation distribution (HOD) models for each tracer. Incorporating SBPs in a power spectrum analysis significantly enhances $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameter constraints; in combination with BAO information from DESI DR2 and a BBN prior on the baryon density, we find the matter density parameter $\\Omega_m=0.2987\\pm 0.0066$, the Hubble constant $H_0=68.80\\pm 0.35\\,\\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude $\\sigma_8 = 0.766\\pm 0.015$ (or the lensing parameter $S_8=0.764\\pm 0.018$), which are $1\\%$, $40\\%$ and $50\\%$ stronger than the baseline results, though with a notable downwards shift in $\\sigma_8$. The SBPs also have a significant impact in extended models, with the dark energy figure-of-merit improving by $70\\%$ ($20\\%$) in a $w_0w_a$CDM analysis when combining with the CMB (and supernovae). In the SBP analysis, we do not find statistically significant evidence for dynamical dark energy: the equation of state parameters are consistent with a cosmological constant within $2.2\\sigma$ ($1.4\\sigma$) in analyses without (with) supernovae. The neutrino mass constraints are also enhanced, with the $95\\%$ limits $M_\\nu<0.073\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $M_\\nu<0.090\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ in $\\Lambda$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM respectively. The latter is the strongest constraint obtained to date and reinforces the preference for the normal neutrino mass hierarchy, regardless of the background dynamics. While our results are sensitive to HOD modeling assumptions, they clearly demonstrate that the inclusion of small-scale information can significantly sharpen cosmological parameter constraints.",

Extracting this information with standard hierarchical methods is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the problem and the computational cost of global-fit analyses. We present a simulation-based inference framework to measure the population properties of galactic binaries directly from the reconstructed foreground. Adopting an astrophysically agnostic parametrization in the observable space -- defined by signal amplitude, frequency, and frequency derivative -- we generate synthetic catalogs and foreground spectra using a global-fit-inspired subtraction algorithm. We then train a neural posterior estimator to map spectra to population parameters. We validate our method on simulated data and recover population parameters with good accuracy, including the total number of binaries. As a by-product, we present a GPU-accelerated version of the subtraction algorithm, which delivers a ~100X speed-up compared to previous implementations in the literature. Our results demonstrate that LISA's stochastic foreground alone carries significant information about the Galactic binary population and provide a practical step toward joint inference from resolved and unresolved sources.",

B 873 (2026) 140134 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) This work examines the cosmological implications of two functional forms of $f(R,T) = R + \\alpha T^n$ gravity: for two different value of $n $ where $n=1$ and $n\\neq 1$, and $\\alpha$ and $n$ are free parameters. The modified Friedmann equations are derived, and the cosmic evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ is determined. Cosmological parameters are estimated through $\\chi^2$ minimization and MCMC analysis using the emcee algorithm, with model parameters constrained by various observational datasets. Both models reproduce late-time acceleration and remain observationally indistinguishable from $\\Lambda$CDM, while allowing small deviations parameterized by $\\alpha$ and $n$. The cosmological behavior of the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, the jerk, the snap parameter $s(z)$, and the effective equation of state parameter $\\omega$ is also analyzed. The results indicate that the Universe transitioned from deceleration to late-time accelerated expansion, consistent with the $\\Lambda$CDM model. Analysis of the energy conditions reveals that the NEC and DEC are satisfied, while the SEC is violated, which explains the transition from a decelerating matter-dominated epoch to the present accelerated phase. These findings indicate that the proposed $f(R,T)$ models are compatible with current observational data and provide a viable alternative to $\\Lambda$CDM in describing cosmic acceleration.",

Future high-frequency surveys of the Galactic Centre (GC) region to be performed by the next-generation radio telescopes, such as the SKA, may discover pulsars that orbit around Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the SMBH dwelling in our GC. In this paper, we present a realistic pulsar-SMBH timing model based on the post-Newtonian equations of motion of the pulsar. Considering the expected timing precision in the future, we take into account several next-to-leading order light propagation time delays in the timing model. For the first time, we include the effects of proper motion of Sgr A*, which were expected to break the spin measurement degeneracy. We forecast the measurement precision of various parameters of Sgr A*, and discuss the data analysis procedure in the presence of red noise, which can be strong if the pulsar is a normal pulsar. The realistic timing model constructed in this study will serve as a useful tool in future searching and timing of pulsar-SMBH systems in the GC.",

For this stellar orbits in the nuclear star cluster are reliable probes. We investigate different dark matter mass profiles through pericentre shift of stellar orbits near the black hole. We also study capability of existing and upcoming astrometric facilities to detect dark matter induced precession and to distinguish between several dark matter profiles. Parameters of different dark matter density profiles are estimated by using the most recent upper bound on dark mass near the black hole. These profiles are then used for calculating the gravitational potential and hence the relativistic pericentre shift of both low and high eccentricity orbits of 13 S-stars. We use the recently measured deviation parameter $f_{sp}$ for investigating competition between dark matter and gravitational physics within S2's orbit. The astrometric shift of the pericentres has been calculated and compared with existing and upcoming astrometric capabilities of large and extremely large telescopes. The orbit of S2 is found to be insensitive to dark matter induced precession. Low eccentricity and wider orbits are prominent probes for measuring dark matter induced precession which is accessible to present and upcoming astrometric facilities such as Keck, GRAVITY and TMT. The existing and upcoming facilities can distinguish between different dark matter profiles for some stars and hence they posses the capability to distinguish between possible formation histories of the central region of our Galaxy.",

However, the complexity of the merger process complicates the interpretation of the associated gravitational-wave and electromagnetic signals. This picture becomes even more complex in the potential scenario in which dark matter accumulates around and in neutron stars, altering their structure and the associated observables. In this work, we study synthetic gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron star mergers with next-generation detectors, investigating their potential to extract both nuclear physics and dark-matter constraints. We also examine how the potential presence of fermionic, non-interacting dark matter inside neutron stars affects the inference of nuclear empirical parameters. We find that combining observations can tighten constraints on nuclear empirical parameters. However, the inferred values remain sensitive to systematic modeling biases and intrinsic degeneracies among the parameters. Conversely, our analysis reveals that even in the presence of dark matter, it will be unlikely to find decisive evidence for dark matter when analyzing gravitational-wave signals. Consequently, systematic biases in nuclear empirical parameter inference potentially resulting from the presence of dark matter are expected to be negligible even for observations with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors.",

We investigate their production in Rastall gravity, a modification of general relativity that introduces a non-minimal coupling between matter and geometry through the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor. Analyz- ing cosmological perturbations during radiation domination, we demonstrate that the Rastall parameter fundamentally alters the collapse dynamics, modifying the growth of density fluctuations, the critical threshold for black hole formation, and the fluctuation amplitude at horizon crossing. Current cosmological constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background, and large-scale structure restrict the Rastall parameter to small values, yet within this allowed range PBH production can be altered by orders of magnitude compared to general relativity.

The enhancement is a consequence of the resonance between the frequency of the fundamental quadrupolar $^2f$-mode of oscillation of the proto-neutron star and the frequency of the epicyclic oscillations at the boundary of the inner core. We observe periods of about several hundred milliseconds each where the resonance is active. The GW emission enhancement produces a correlated resonant modulation of the associated neutrino signal at the same frequencies. With GW frequencies of $\\mathcal{O}(1\\,\\mathrm{kHz})$ and strain amplitudes within the sensitivity curves of current and next-generation interferometers at distances of $\\mathcal{O}(1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc})$, this resonant-amplification mechanism may represent a potential game-changer for unveiling the supernova explosion mechanism through multimessenger astronomy.",

In the DE sector, we exploit the EFT of vector-tensor theories with the presence of a preferred time direction on the cosmological background. This prescription allows one to accommodate shift-symmetric and non-shift-symmetric scalar-tensor theories by taking a particular weak coupling limit, with and without consistency conditions respectively. We deal with the DM sector as a non-relativistic perfect fluid, which can be described by a system of three scalar fields. By choosing a unitary gauge in which the perturbations in the DE and DM sectors are eaten by the metric, we incorporate the leading-order operators that characterize the energy and momentum transfers besides those present in the conventional EFT of vector-tensor and scalar-tensor theories and the non-relativistic perfect fluid. We express the second-order action of scalar perturbations in real space in terms of time- and scale-dependent dimensionless EFT parameters and derive the linear perturbation equations of motion by taking into account additional matter (baryons, radiation). In the small-scale limit, we obtain conditions for the absence of both ghosts and Laplacian instabilities and discuss how they are affected by the DE-DM interactions. We also compute the effective DM gravitational coupling $G_{\\rm eff}$ by using a quasi-static approximation for perturbations deep inside the DE sound horizon and show that the existence of momentum and energy transfers allow a possibility to realize $G_{\\rm eff}$ smaller than in the uncoupled case at low redshift.",

Lim 25 pages, 9 figures, 1 video: this https URL Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We investigate the effects of large scalar inhomogeneities during the kination epoch, a period in which the universe's dynamics are dominated by the kinetic energy of a scalar field, by fully evolving the Einstein equations using numerical relativity. By tracking the non-linear growth of scalar perturbations with both sub-horizon and super-horizon initial wavelengths, we are able to compare their evolution to perturbative results. Our key findings show that in the deep sub-horizon limit, the perturbative behaviour remains valid, whereas in the super-horizon regime, non-linear dynamics exhibit a much richer phenomenology. Finally, we discuss the possibility of primordial black hole formation from the collapse of such perturbations and assess whether this process could serve as a viable mechanism to reheat the universe in the post-inflationary era.",

We investigate the observational signatures of a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in a Hernquist dark matter (DM) halo under three distinct accretion scenarios: a geometrically thin disk, a static spherical flow, and an infalling spherical flow. For the thin disk model, we find that direct emission dominates the total observed intensity, while the size and brightness of the lensing and photon rings serve as sensitive probes of the Hernquist DM parameters. Under spherical accretion, the Hernquist DM halo significantly enlarges the photon sphere. This results in an observable shadow that is approximately $2\\%$ to $30\\%$ larger than in the vacuum case, though this increase in size is accompanied by a considerable decrease in overall image brightness. Furthermore, the Doppler de-boosting effect in the infalling scenario produces a markedly darker image than its static counterpart. Our results demonstrate that the size and brightness profile of a black hole shadow provide a powerful observational tool to probe and constrain the distribution of dark matter in galactic centers.",

By analyzing the latest observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT)~\\cite{ACT:2025fju, ACT:2025tim}, we demonstrate that the observed preference for positive running ($\\alpha_s$) of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ imposes significant restrictions on the parameter space for a large class of ultra-slow-roll (USR) models. This tension becomes progressively pronounced for more massive PBHs, posing substantial challenges for USR models to yield a detectable PBH abundance, especially in the mass range probed by ongoing and future gravitational-wave experiments such as LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA and the Einstein Telescope. However, this discrepancy is minimal for asteroid-mass PBHs, which are still capable of feasibly constituting the entirety of dark matter. To numerically probe the six-dimensional parameter space of the models, we adapted a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to efficiently scan over the viable configurations. Our results further indicate that, in non-minimally coupled polynomial inflation, a viable cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum is best obtained at an inflection point for which second-order slow-roll approximation is necessary for precise CMB predictions.",

We recast the dark sector, cosmic acceleration, large-scale structure, and cosmic tensions as emergent consequences of nonlocal memory and intrinsically persistent organization in a self-gravitating Universe. By introducing a maximum-caliber weight on cosmic histories and a bias functional encoding structural memory, we derive modified Friedmann, Boltzmann, and Poisson equations that naturally generate dark energy-like acceleration, dark matter-like clustering, and scale-dependent growth suppression. We also show how this approach can naturally help alleviate the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, can produce anisotropic velocity fields, and predict environment-dependent halo signatures that cannot arise from particle dark matter or scalar-field dark energy. We also derive a generalized horizon entropy and temperature, revealing a nonequilibrium statistical origin for cosmic acceleration and formulating a Law of Universal Arbitrage Equilibrium that governs the evolution of the Universe, showing that it is expanding towards a continuous form of Nash equilibrium. Cosmological Teleodynamics therefore offers a unified, emergent, and testable alternative to the conventional dark sector, rooted not in new particles but in the intrinsic statistical and systemic structure of cosmic memory, and shows that the universe itself operates like a giant potential game.",

Theoretically, both of these boundaries are expected to coincide at the outskirts of halos. However, hydrodynamic cosmological simulations have highlighted significant displacement between them. In this study, we utilise the IllustrisTNG simulation suite to investigate the statistical relationship between the splashback and shock surfaces in a sample of 812 cluster-mass halos. We compute the full angular distribution of both boundaries and examine their relationship, also considering how different moments of this distribution correlate with halo properties. We employ a dispersion-based measure for the splashback boundary and the maximum entropy distance for the shock location. Despite examining various boundary definitions, we consistently observe an offset between the splashback and shock boundaries, with $R_{\\rm sh}/R_{\\rm sp} \\sim 1.3-2$, depending on specific methodological choices. This offset predominantly occurs along void directions. We analyse the redshift evolution of these boundaries for a subset of halos and find that splashback and shock boundaries are not necessarily distinct at earlier times. During mergers, gas dissipates energy and resists contraction via pressure, unlike collisionless dark matter, leading to the observed boundary offset. We also find that the feature in pressure profiles arising from the outer accretion shock is sensitive to the exact method of stacking, which has important implications for observations.",

Zou 35 pages, 14 figures, 5 tables, submitted to JCAP Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present a cosmological analysis combining full-shape (FS) clustering measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR1 with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI DR2. To achieve a robust combination that accounts for the correlation between the two data releases, we employ the ShapeFit compression method and estimate the joint covariance using EZmocks. This compressed approach inherently mitigates the prior volume effects that have previously dominated Bayesian constraints from DESI data with minimal external priors. Consequently, we obtain--for the first time within a Bayesian framework--reliable DESI-only constraints on extensions to $\\Lambda$CDM using only a Big Bang Nucleosynthesis prior on the baryon density and a wide prior on the spectral index. In flat $\\Lambda$CDM, we find $\\Omega_m = 0.3035 \\pm 0.0085$, $h = 0.6876 \\pm 0.0059$, and $\\sigma_8 = 0.822 \\pm 0.034$. For the $w_0 w_a$CDM dynamical dark energy model, we measure $w_0 = 0.49 \\pm 0.25$ and $w_a = -1.52 \\pm 0.77$, improving constraints by $\\sim 30\\%$ relative to the analogous DR1 measurement and reducing the discrepancy with $\\Lambda$CDM to $1.4\\sigma$ when compared to BAO only analyses. We also report competitive limits on the sum of neutrino masses and spatial curvature. This work demonstrates that the ShapeFit compression provides a prior-robust and computationally efficient pathway to constrain beyond-$\\Lambda$CDM physics with large-scale structure.",

      "abstract": "Evidence for Log-Periodic Modulation in High-Redshift Compact Object Abundance Consistent with Cyclic Condensate Collapse Takeshi Fukuyama Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We analyze the redshift distribution of high-$z$ galaxies and active galactic nuclei identified in early JWST data, and investigate the presence of periodic structure in the variable $x=\\ln(1+z)$. A baseline-corrected unbinned frequency analysis reveals a statistically significant peak corresponding to a spacing $\\Delta x \\simeq 0.34$, suggesting an approximately log-periodic pattern in the redshift distribution. A periodic structure in $x$ implies a preferred scaling ratio in $(1+z)$, which may be interpreted as a realization of discrete scale invariance. We discuss the possibility that such behavior arises from cyclic condensate dynamics in Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) cosmology. In the Fukuyama--Morikawa--Tatekawa framework, repeated collapse and re-formation episodes of a self-interacting condensate occur over characteristic timescales of order several $10^8$ years. When mapped into redshift space, this temporal periodicity naturally translates into an approximately constant spacing in $\\ln(1+z)$. While the observed frequency is not interpreted as a sharp theoretical prediction, its magnitude is quantitatively consistent with the intrinsic cycle timescale of QCD-axion motivated condensate dynamics. The present analysis therefore provides observational support for cyclic BEC cosmology as a viable dynamical origin of log-periodic structure in the high-redshift universe.",

The present investigation is undertaken in the Einstein frame. The motion of the scalaron is studied for the slow roll inflationary era using analytic approximate solutions obtained from its potential and, from these solutions, analytic expressions for the Ricci scalar, its time derivative, the Hubble parameter and the scale factor of the Universe. These expressions for the Starobinsky model were obtained first by Motohashi and Nishizawa (2012) but the expressions for the power-law model of Odintsov and Oikonomou and its generalization are new. The calculated values of the baryon asymmetry factor $\\eta $ for the Starobinsky model vary from $(1.05 - 1.46) \\times 10^{-11}$, and for the power-law model, from $(1.06 - 1.53) \\times 10^{-11}$. The power-law values depend upon the unknown fitting parameters $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$, and a future fit of the Odintsov and Oikonomou model to data could yield enhanced values. The values for $\\eta$ depend upon a mass parameter $M_{\\ast}$ which is expected to be of the order of $M_{Pl}=2.435 \\times 10^{18}$ GeV. The values of $\\eta$ for both models have been calculated for $M_{\\ast}=M_{Pl}$ and are quite close to the observed value $\\eta = 8.65 \\times 10^{-11}$.

We perform a Fisher forecast incorporating realistic survey noise, foreground modeling for clustered CIB and radio sources, and full marginalization over cosmological and astrophysical nuisance parameters, including per-bin galaxy bias perturbations, photometric redshift shifts, intrinsic alignments, and baryonic feedback modeled with HMCode2020. With optimized tomographic binning (10 lens and 5 source bins for LSST; 6 lens and 5 source bins for CSST), we forecast marginalized constraints of $0.98\\%$ for SO+LSST, $1.60\\%$ for CMB-S4+LSST, and $2.40\\%$ for CMB-S4+CSST. Tomography improves $b_{\\mathrm{HSE}}$ precision by factors of approximately three relative to non-tomographic analyses, reflecting the role of redshift information in breaking the $b_{\\mathrm{HSE}}$--$\\sigma_8$ degeneracy.

The defect-induced anisotropies are computed using the Unconnected Segment Model for Nambu-Goto and Abelian-Higgs strings, as well as for stable domain walls, and included in a full Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis jointly varying all $\\Lambda$CDM parameters, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the string/domain wall tension. No statistically significant evidence for defects is found, although we observe a mild preference for non-zero cosmic string tension.

In the particular case of strings, the improvement is driven by the $B$-mode data, and is especially pronounced for Abelian-Higgs strings. We also present forecasts for upcoming Simons Observatory data and find that, with the baseline noise configuration, the constraints on the string tension could improve by about a factor of three. Finally, we assess the impact of Nambu-Goto string loops on CMB anisotropies in light of both current and future observations.",

We argue that this component of matter was not only already on the stage of the scientific debates of the time, but also, in a more concealed form, played a central role in Zwicky's epistemic context. We thus reject the narration that dark matter is the result of a ``na{ï}ve'' astrophysical observation and emphasise the cosmological motivations that prompted Zwicky to presciently search for it. Moreover, with regard to its abundance, we argue that the discrepancy between the observed amount of luminous matter in the Coma Cluster and Zwicky's higher mass estimate derived from virial analysis was not, in fact, astonishing. What Zwicky described as a surprising excess of dark matter was of precisely the order of magnitude he had set out to identify. Consequently, we challenge the widespread view that dark matter was merely an ad hoc hypothesis introduced to rescue Newtonian theory. Instead, we suggest it may represent one of the earliest cosmological indications supporting a new emerging theory of gravitation: General Relativity. This reinterpretation contributes to ongoing debates in the philosophy of science concerning the epistemic status of ad hoc hypotheses.",

This paper introduces a Fisher Information approach to determine theoretical limits to information extraction in the context of one-zone models. By evaluating the total Fisher Information by varying $\\delta$, $B$, $p$, $\\gamma_{\\rm min}$ and $\\gamma_{\\rm max}$, we find that EC models encode Fisher information $\\gtrsim10^4$ times less than that in SSC models, establishing differences in limits of physical information extraction even in the case of perfect sampling. Moreover, the Fisher information in both SSC and EC models exhibit strong fluctuations across the parameter space, but since the magnitudes are orders of magnitude lower in EC, limits of parameter inference are expected to be worse in FSRQ SEDs than BL Lacs. We also find that the Doppler factor $\\delta$ carries at least $10^{2-3}$ more Fisher information than that for $p$ and $B$ in both EC and SSC, making $\\delta$ the most constrained SED parameter. Applying our Fisher Information motivated framework to real flaring SEDs of Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) CTA 102 and 3C 279, we show that mild variations in $\\delta$ and $p$ can appreciably produce the flaring SEDs starting from the quiescent model, while two other flares in 3C 279 simple geometric and spectral considerations cannot reproduce the flares, reducing the efficacy of one-zone models. We propose that time-resolved SED models are indispensable to constraining physical parameters in EC-dominated blazars.",

Achieving CSST's cosmological goals requires precise redshifts ($\\sigma_{\\rm NMAD}\\lesssim 0.002-0.005$) from low-resolution ($R\\sim200$) and potentially blended slitless spectra. We present BayeSED3, extended for Bayesian full-spectrum analysis, including nebular emission modeling (via \\textsc{Cloudy}) and a Bayesian treatment of the model scaling factor, improving reliability over optimization methods for low SNR spectra. Validated on realistic mock data generated with the CESS emulator (median SNR=1.65, including instrumental and self-blending effects), our method achieves excellent redshift precision with three-band (GU+GV+GI) spectroscopy: $\\sigma_{\\rm NMAD}=0.0008$ ($\\sim$80% success) for star-forming and $\\sigma_{\\rm NMAD}=0.0015$ ($\\sim$50% success) for quiescent galaxies.

Self-blending increases scatter by $\\gtrsim30%$, but combining spectroscopy with CSST's seven-band photometry significantly improves accuracy, especially for quiescent galaxies and data-limited cases. Single-band spectroscopy plus photometry yields reasonable redshifts: GU+photometry is limited, GI+photometry gives >60% (SF) and >40% (quiescent) success at $\\sigma_{\\rm NMAD}\\lesssim0.002$, GV+photometry gives >35% (SF) and $\\sim$40% (quiescent) at similar precision.

Riseley, Ralf-Jürgen Dettmar, Julia Becker Tjus Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Dwarf galaxies are important laboratories for studying cosmic magnetism because they can maintain strong magnetic fields via the action of turbulent dynamo despite their low mass and weak gravitational potential. The Magnetic-field Evolution in Dwarf galaxies from Ultra-deep SKA Analysis (MEDUSA) survey is the first SKA-pathfinder programme designed to obtain deep continuum, polarisation, and HI data for dwarf galaxies, enabling a comprehensive study of their radio spectra, magnetic fields, and gas kinematics across a representative population. By analysing the radio continuum spectra and polarisation of the dwarf-dwarf galaxy merger NGC 1487 from the MEDUSA sample, we aim to determine its magnetic field strength and to characterise the large-scale and turbulent components of its magnetic field. We utilise highly sensitive multi-band radio continuum data from MeerKAT L-band (1.28 GHz) and Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) L/S (2.1 GHz), C (5.5 GHz), and X-bands (9 GHz). We analysed the magnetic field configuration using polarisation and rotation measure (RM) synthesis. The integrated spectral energy distribution has a non-thermal spectral index of $\\alpha_{\\rm nth} = -0.678\\pm0.085$. Synchrotron and inverse Compton losses cause a spectral break at $\\nu_{\\rm b} = 6.2\\pm1.3$ GHz. In star-forming regions, the magnetic field exhibits strong small-scale fluctuations in RM, suggesting the action of a small-scale dynamo. Conversely, the field becomes more ordered, aligning with the tidal arms toward the galaxy's outskirts, showing a large-scale magnetic field over $\\approx3$ kpc. Observations of the dwarf-dwarf merger NGC 1487 show that even low-mass galaxy mergers, likely the building blocks of larger galaxies in the early Universe, can rapidly amplify and produce coherent large-scale magnetic field structures, highlighting their key contribution in the early magnetisation of galaxies.",

These radio fluxes may be a detectable probe of a huge gravitational burst expected from Supernovae explosions. The earliest prompt radio signal, coinciding with the neutrino burst, is due to conversion in the terrestrial (or Jovian) magnetic field and is below the micro-Jansky (or milli-Jansky) level for a galactic Supernova like SN1987A. A later radio signal, a ``tail'', due to the same graviton - radio wave conversion in random interstellar fields will maintain a relic radio ``noise'' for hundreds or thousands of years and might even be still detectable by a very sensitive network of satellite antennas at the kilohertz band. Exact solutions are presented here for the graviton-photon conversion in a refractive medium, as well as their consequences for high energy supernovae and the 2.726 K background radiation.",

However, when extended to the galactic or cosmological scale, it requires dark matter and dark energy to explain observations. In our previous article (arXiv:2308.04503), we've formulated a gravity theory based in Mach's principle, known as Machian gravity. We demonstrated that the theory successfully explains galactic velocity profiles without requiring additional dark matter components. In previous studies, for a selected set of galaxy clusters, we also showed its ability to explain the velocity dispersion in the clusters without extra unseen matter components. This paper primarily explores the mass profiles of galaxy clusters. We test the Machian Gravity acceleration law on two distinct sets comprising galaxy clusters sourced from various studies. We fitted the dynamic mass profiles using the Machian gravity model. The outcomes of our study show good agreement between the theory and observational results.",

Hydrodynamical simulations are often used to constrain priors or calibrate models. Therefore, obtaining the maximum amount of information possible from these simulations is imperative. In this work, we have combined the information of shapes projected over two or three axes ($x,y,z$), for intrinsic alignment signals ($w_{g+},\\ \\tilde{\\xi}_{g+,2}$), showing a consistent gain in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for all cases studied using TNG300-1. The gain in SNR is found to be higher for the addition of the second projection than for the third, and higher for shapes calculated using the reduced inertia tensor rather than the simple one. The two shape samples studied, $n_\\star>300$ and $\\mathrm{log}(M_\\star \\ h/\\mathrm{M_\\odot})>10.5$, where the latter has a much higher signal amplitude, show similar gains in SNR when more projections are added. We also model the correlation functions with the non-linear alignment model. The SNR gains from the measurements are higher but consistent with the constraints on the non-linear alignment amplitude $A_{\\rm IA}$ and galaxy bias $b_{\\rm g}$. Using multiple projection axes increases SNR overall, enabling more efficient use of numerically expensive hydrodynamical simulations.",

By leveraging the angular clustering of astrophysical gravitational wave sources (AGWS) from the third-generation detectors and CSST's weak lensing surveys, we develop a theoretical framework to compute auto- and cross-angular power spectra of AGWS clustering, cosmic shear, and their cross-correlation. Mock datasets are generated by considering the detector-specific selection functions, uncertainties in luminosity distance, and weak lensing systematics. We employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to constrain the $\\Lambda \\mathrm{CDM}$ cosmological parameters, AWGS bias parameters, and star formation rate (SFR) parameters under three detector configurations. Our results demonstrate that the joint observation can achieve sub-$5\\%$ precision on $H_0$ ($2.19\\%$) and $w$ ($5.7\\%$). Besides, the AGWS clustering bias parameters can be constrained to the precision of $4\\%-5\\%$, enabling the differentiation between stellar-origin compact binaries and primordial black hole scenarios. This multi-messenger approach can also be helpful to resolve mass-redshift degeneracies in the dark siren methods, providing independent validation for the Hubble tension. Our work indicates that the joint observation of the third-generation GW detectors and the CSST can be a powerful probe of the large-scale structure and the cosmic expansion history.",

These datasets allow us to effectively break parameter degeneracy, obtain stringent cosmological constraint results, and conduct systematic model comparison and selection.

Besides, we compare the impacts of different SNe Ia datasets (PantheonPlus and DESY5) and BAO datasets (DESI-DR2 and BOSS-DR12) on the constraints of the cosmological models. By employing Bayesian evidence and other model selection criteria, we find that the choice of SNe Ia and BAO datasets can significantly influence the inferred preference for cosmological models.

Capistrano, Özgür Akarsu Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We test the dynamical dark-energy $w_0w_a$CDM (CPL) framework against $\\Lambda$CDM using CMB anisotropies and lensing together with late-time distance probes: DESI DR2 BAO, the completed SDSS-IV BAO consensus compilation, a transverse/angular BAO compilation (BAOtr), and the Cepheid-calibrated PantheonPlus SN~Ia likelihood (PP\\&SH0ES). We find that CPL inferences are strongly dataset-dependent. With CMB data alone, the broad geometric degeneracy in $(H_0,\\Omega_{\\rm m},w_0,w_a)$ admits an extrapolation tail that can extend to $q_0<-1$ (super-acceleration), whereas adding DESI DR2 BAO pulls the reconstruction toward a weakly accelerating or nearly coasting present-day Universe ($q_0\\simeq 0$). In contrast, combining CMB with PP\\&SH0ES and BAOtr yields a conventional moderately accelerating expansion ($-1<q_0\\lesssim 0$) and substantially reduces the Hubble tension. Across all combinations, $w(z\\to\\infty)=w_0+w_a<-1$, while at post-recombination redshifts the expansion remains matter dominated ($q\\to1/2$). The origin of this behavior can be traced to low-redshift distance information: BAOtr and DESI prefer different BAO distance ratios at $z\\lesssim 0.5$, which propagates into divergent expansion histories in CPL. In all cases, $r_{\\rm d}$ stays nearly unchanged, indicating that shifts in $H_0$ arise from late-time expansion freedom rather than early-Universe physics. Bayesian evidence mirrors this contingency: it is strong for CPL mainly when PP\\&SH0ES and/or BAOtr are included, while it is inconclusive for CMB-only and CMB+DESI and moderately favors $\\Lambda$CDM for CMB+SDSS. Overall, our results show that the apparent support for CPL and its ability to ease the Hubble tension are not universal but depend sensitively on the adopted low-redshift distance data, motivating either more flexible late-time models or closer scrutiny of residual systematics in current BAO determinations.",

This review assesses the ``$S_8$ tension'' against a new 2026 baseline: a unified ``Combined CMB'' framework incorporating Planck, ACT DR6, and SPT-3G. This combined analysis yields $S_8 = 0.836^{+0.012}_{-0.013}$, providing a higher central value and reduced uncertainties compared to Planck alone. Compiling measurements from 2019--2026, we reveal a striking bifurcation: DES Year 6 results exhibit a statistically significant tension of $2.4\\sigma$--$2.7\\sigma$ in $S_8$ \\citep{DESY6}, whereas KiDS Legacy results demonstrate statistical consistency at $<1\\sigma$ \\citep{Wright2025}. We examine systematic origins of this dichotomy, including photometric redshift calibration, intrinsic alignment modeling, and shear measurement pipelines. We further contextualize these findings with cluster counts (where eROSITA favors high values while SPT favors low), galaxy-galaxy lensing, and redshift-space distortions. The heterogeneous landscape suggests survey-specific systematic effects contribute substantially to observed discrepancies, though new physics beyond $\\Lambda$CDM cannot be excluded.",

Ciorba 9 pages, 11 figures, Submitted to A&A Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Direct numerical simulation of subsonic turbulence with smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) has traditionally been hampered by zeroth-order (E0) errors, inaccurate gradient evaluations, and excessive numerical dissipation. We demonstrate that the recently developed SPH-EXA code can overcome these challenges, producing results similar to those of other state-of-the-art non-SPH codes, such as AREPO and GIZMO. We show that SPH-EXA accurately reproduces the Kolmogorov inertial range scaling in the subsonic regime with increasing resolution, closely matching state-of-the-art non-SPH methods. This is an outstanding result given the important role of SPH codes in astrophysics and cosmology, and the ubiquity of turbulent phenomena.",

Bryan, Zoltan Haiman 19 pages, 6 figures, replaced with version accepted by JCAP Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Recently, Sodini et al. (2024) presented a sample of OI damped Lyman-$\\alpha$ absorption system (DLA) analogs at $z\\sim6$ that contain possible chemical signatures of Population III (Pop III) stars. In this paper, we use an N-body simulation-based semi-analytic model of the first stars and galaxies to predict the impact of Pop III stars on high-redshift DLAs. These Pop III DLA predictions are the first to include a number of important physical effects such as Lyman-Werner (LW) feedback, reionization, and external metal enrichment (all of which account for three-dimensional spatial fluctuations caused by halo clustering). We predict the abundance of DLAs as a function of their carbon-to-oxygen ratios ([C/O]). We find that our fiducial model is strongly ruled out by the data as it contains too few high-[C/O] DLAs, which have metals primarily from Pop III stars. However, increasing the delay time between Pop III and metal-enriched star formation due to supernovae feedback leads to better agreement with the data. Our results suggest that DLA analogs at $z\\sim6$ are a promising probe of Pop III star formation for two key reasons. First, for reasonable parameter choices there are significant numbers of DLAs with metals primarily originating from Pop III stars. Second, we find that the number of DLAs with substantial Pop III contributions depends strongly on the Pop III star formation efficiency and the delay time between Pop III and metal-enriched star formation.",

For visualisations, see the COLIBRE website at this http URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present the COLIBRE galaxy formation model and the COLIBRE suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. COLIBRE includes new models for radiative cooling, dust grains, star formation, stellar mass loss, turbulent diffusion, pre-supernova stellar feedback, supernova feedback, supermassive black holes and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. The multiphase interstellar medium is explicitly modelled without a pressure floor. Hydrogen and helium are tracked in non-equilibrium, with their contributions to the free electron density included in metal-line cooling calculations. The chemical network is coupled to a dust model that tracks three grain species and two grain sizes. In addition to the fiducial thermally-driven AGN feedback, a subset of simulations uses black hole spin-dependent hybrid jet/thermal AGN feedback. To suppress spurious transfer of energy from dark matter to stars, dark matter is supersampled by a factor 4, yielding similar dark matter and baryonic particle masses. The subgrid feedback model is calibrated to match the observed $z \\approx 0$ galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy sizes, and black hole masses in massive galaxies. The COLIBRE suite includes three resolutions, with particle masses of $\\sim 10^5$, $10^6$, and $10^7\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$ in cubic volumes of up to 100, 200, and 400 cMpc on a side, respectively. The largest runs use 136 billion ($5 \\times 3008^3$) particles. We describe the model, assess its strengths and limitations, and present both visual impressions and quantitative results. Comparisons with various low-redshift galaxy observations generally show very good numerical convergence and excellent agreement with the data.",

Gamma-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offers the opportunity to indirectly probe such an intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), as gamma rays interact with cosmic radiation fields, producing electron-positron pairs, and initiate an electromagnetic cascade. The deflection of the pairs in the IGMF results in a time-delayed signal at GeV energies. Using observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope of the GRB 221009A, we are able to derive the most stringent constraints to date from the non-observation of the cascade and rule out magnetic fields B < 2.5 x 10^{-17} G at 95% confidence level for a coherence length larger than 1 Mpc. Our results are comparable to limits obtained from blazar observations but do not suffer from assumptions on the duty cycle of the gamma-ray source or whether inverse-Compton scattering losses dominate over the development of plasma instabilities.",

Sander Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Little Red Dots (LRDs), among the most enigmatic high-redshift discoveries by JWST, are commonly believed to be powered by accreting supermassive black holes. Here, we explore the possibility that these sources are globular clusters in formation, with rest-frame UV arising from a very young stellar population and rest-frame optical from a short-lived supermassive ($>10^4$ M$_\\odot$) star. The spectral profiles of LRDs are broadly consistent with this scenario, though the observed temperatures and bolometric luminosities favor emission reprocessed by optically thick, continuum-driven winds not fully captured by current models. The LRD $z\\sim5-7$ UV luminosity function naturally evolves, under standard evolutionary and mass-loss prescriptions, into a present-day mass function with a turnover at $\\log_{10}(M_\\ast$/$M_\\odot)=5.3$ and an exponential cutoff at high masses, consistent with local globular-cluster populations. We estimate the total present-day number density of LRDs formed across all redshifts to be $\\approx0.3$ Mpc$^{-3}$, similar to local globular clusters. The observed LRD redshift range matches the age distribution of metal-poor globular clusters, without current LRD counterparts to the metal-rich population. If LRDs are globular clusters in formation, we predict chemical abundance patterns characteristic of multiple stellar populations, including enhanced He and N, and potential Na-O and Al-Mg anti-correlations. These results offer a local perspective to explore this surprisingly abundant population of distant sources, and a potential new window into extreme stellar astrophysics in the early Universe.",

      "abstract": "Accretion disks in (repeating) partial tidal disruption events: rapid state transitions, UV plateaus and flares from disk-remnant collisions Andrew Mummery 10 pages, 4 figures. Version accepted in MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Tidal disruption events which repeat on timescales of months-to-years represent an unambiguous signature of a partial disruption, with the surviving stellar remnant returning to pericentre to be repeatedly stripped by tidal forces. These systems therefore offer the best laboratories to study the differences between partial and full disruptions. One noteworthy observational difference between the two systems is that all known X-ray bright repeating TDEs show rapid transitions between thermal, non-thermal and completely dim states on timescales much shorter than full (non-repeating) TDEs. We argue this can be simply understood as being due to the reduction in fuel supply available to the disk, and that these systems provide evidence that all tidal disruption events undergo a state transition at Eddington ratios $f_{\\rm edd} = L_{\\rm bol}/L_{\\rm edd} \\sim 0.01$, similar to X-ray binaries. {As part of this calculation we derive a general expression for the time taken for a TDE disk to fall to a given Eddington fraction, which will be of use to both full and partial TDE science.} Perhaps surprisingly, the late-time optical/UV plateau luminosity observed from these systems is largely unaffected by this reduction in fuel supply, provided the outer disk remains in a thermal state for long enough for this emission to be detected. We then show that collisions between the returning stellar remnant and the disk formed from the last passage will produce potentially observable X-ray flares ($L_{\\rm flare} \\simeq 10^{42}$ erg/s), but that they are likely to be very difficult to detect as they are generally short-lived ($t_{\\rm flare} \\simeq 0.1-1$ hr).",

Accepted for publication in PRL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex) The Forbush decrease (FD) of cosmic rays is an important probe of the interplanetary environment disturbed by solar activities. In this work, we study the properties of 8 FDs electrons (including positrons) between 2 GeV and 20 GeV from January, 2016 to March, 2024, with the Dark Matter Particle Explorer. The maximum decrease amplitudes of these events are about 30% - 15%, and the amplitudes reduce with energy. The recovery time of these events shows diverse behaviors of their energy-dependence. Some of them show strong energy-dependence, while some have a nearly constant recovery time. It has been shown that such diverse behaviors could be related with the geometry of the disturbed regions of the interplanetary space by coronal mass ejections (CME), represented by the combined effect of the CME velocity, angular spread, and ejection direction.",

We performed a comprehensive timing analysis of all thermonuclear bursts from the newly discovered millisecond X-ray pulsar SRGA J144459.2$-$604207, observed with NICER, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR during the 2024 outburst. A total of 39 bursts were detected, allowing for a detailed search for burst oscillations, which had not been previously observed from this source. We report the discovery of burst oscillations at 447.7$-$448.0 Hz from SRGA J144459.2$-$604207 using XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data, consistent with the spin frequency of the NS. The strongest burst oscillation in the XMM-Newton data occurred with a single-trial significance of $5.1\\sigma$ and maximum $Z^2$ power of $\\sim31$. In the NuSTAR data, the strongest oscillation signal has a significance of $5.2\\sigma$ and maximum $Z^2$ power of $\\sim32$. The folded pulse profile corresponding to the strongest signal in the 0.5-10 keV band of the XMM-Newton data shows a sinusoidal shape with a fractional rms amplitude of $\\sim8.5\\%$, while the measurements of the NuSTAR data (3-40 keV range) yield $\\sim21\\%$. These results represent the first detection of burst oscillations in SRGA J144459.2$-$604207. Additionally, we report the detection of 447.6 Hz oscillations occurring just before a burst onset observed with XMM-Newton. This marks only the second instance in which burst oscillations have been observed before the burst onset.",

Sutaria, Riddhiman Sharma, Alak K.Ray The paper has been accepted by APJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We report on a spectroscopic study of the bright, nearby type-IIn supernova SN 2017hcc, and SN 2023usc using data obtained from the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT). SN 2017hcc is well-studied event, and our sampling covers 7 epochs, starting from +14\\,d post explosion, and continuing into the nebular stage, at +411\\,d. The type-IIn event SN 2023usc was sampled over 5 epochs from +12\\,d to +155\\,d post explosion. The nearly featureless (except H$\\alpha$) late time (+62\\,d onward) spectra of SN 2023usc, suggests a novel explosion route for this type-IIn event. Assuming a CSM model created by multi-epoch ejection of material from the pre-explosion progenitor, we present here a comparative study of both events with several other type-IIn / interacting supernovae in progenitors with persistent signatures of a CSM. We find that true narrow lines ($v \\ll 1000$\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$) emerge in the early ($\\sim$ +10\\,d) spectra only in few events (SN 2017hcc, SN 2023usc and SN 2010jl) initially classified as type-IIn in our sample -- in most cases the line velocity hovers at $\\sim 1000$\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$ even in the very early epochs. CSM line velocity being indicative of its extent and opacity, this suggests that progenitors with a highly extended CSMs, which are also optically transparent in their outer regions may be relatively rare.",

Hence, this work provides the first indication of the possible existence of such a ``nuclear Urca process\". The observation of MAXI J1752$-$457 implies a hot ignition layer with a maximum temperature of $\\sim4~{\\rm GK}$, located near the Urca shell in the ocean, such that the nuclear Urca process becomes dominant for up to $\\sim2$ days after the superburst. This behavior is distinct from that of normal Type-I X-ray bursts, which are triggered by hydrogen or helium burning in much shallower layers than those of superbursts. Our findings enable probing of superburst ashes through Urca pairs via long-term monitoring of crust cooling on day-long timescales.",

Tsygankov, Roberto Turolla, Kinwah Wu, Silvia Zane The Astrophysical Journal, Volume 998, Number 1, 2026 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) RCW 86 is a supernova remnant whose origin has recently been linked to an off-center explosion within a cavity created by its progenitor star. In the southwestern region, the forward shock is thought to have reached the cavity wall, encountering diverse environmental conditions. We report on the spatially resolved X-ray polarimetric observation of RCW 86 with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). In the 2--4.5 keV energy band we find no significant detection of polarization. Employing a dedicated background subtraction procedure and Bayesian spectropolarimetric fitting, we derive 99% upper limits on the polarization degree of the synchrotron component: 15% in higher-statistics regions and 30%--40% in lower-statistics regions. These upper limits on the polarization degree in several regions exclude the possibility of a strongly coherent magnetic field down to the subparsec scale, and that of a moderately coherent one on the scale of the synchrotron features as resolved by IXPE. The results indicate that the shocks in the southwestern rim of RCW 86 propagate more slowly than the unshocked ejecta at their locations, yet exceed the measured proper motion speeds. This behavior is consistent with reflected shocks occurring in tenuous regions of the shocked ejecta, distinct from regions that are radio-bright.",

These filaments are usually asymmetric with very weak emission from the other side of the main filaments, and no significant spectral variation has been detected across these filaments, implying inefficient energy loss of emitting particles. We develop a Monte Carlo code to simulate particle transport in a large scale magnetic field and apply the model to PSR B2224+4415 (Guitar). It is shown that, with an injection power of a few tens of percent of the pulsar spin down luminosity, TeV e$^{\\pm}$ can explain the observed filament properties with a scattering mean free path along the magnetic field comparable to the length of the observed filament. The model predicts a dim diffuse symmetric X-ray background aligned with the filament on a larger scale, whose flux is proportional to the X-ray emitting e$^{\\pm}$ energy loss time for a stable e$^{\\pm}$ injection power comparable to the luminosity of this diffuse background. Observations with a large field of view and good sensitivity should be able to detect such a component.",

EL-Zant High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Blazars exhibit variable emission on diverse timescales. Some light curves show signs of quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs), which may encode clues regarding the physical processes behind the emission or point to supermassive binary black holes. We analyzed five blazars with previously reported high significance year-long QPOs, applying the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and Weighted Wavelet Z-transform methods to Fermi-LAT data up to early 2025. We furthermore examined an additional source (PKS 0139-09), where nascent QPO may be present. As the light curves showed longer term trends, we detrended the data using an STL decomposition, which often revealed a large seasonal component. We find that detrending generally leads to an increase in the strength of the QPO signal. However, except for PG 1553+113, where a clearly persistent QPO signal is present, we detect transience on a timescale of $\\lesssim$4000 days. We then forecast the light curves over the following four years, using a traditional statistical method as well as a Transformer-based deep learning model. Applied to a test set, the latter showed significant success in predicting behavior that seems unexpected from simple inspection of the past data. Analyzing the extended time series suggests a markedly weaker QPO signals over the coming years in cases where the transient behavior appears near the end of the observational data. In contrast, in the nascent candidate QPO source (PKS 0139-09) the signal is expected to strengthen significantly. These predictions, which may reflect the physical origin of the QPOs, can be tested against future data.",

Siegel, Kendrick Smith, Michele Woodland High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Quantifying the maximum energy of fast radio bursts (FRBs) can provide stringent constraints on their emission mechanisms and progenitor models. However, the most energetic bursts are rare, requiring a large sample of FRBs to detect them. In this work, we use the largest available such sample, 2,998 one-off FRBs from the Second CHIME/FRB Catalog, to obtain a lower limit on the maximum energy ($E^{\\mathrm{max}}_{\\mathrm{iso}}$) of FRBs, assuming isotropic energy distribution from FRB sources. In the absence of known redshifts ($z$) for most sources, we present a framework that uses the dispersion measures (DMs) and fluences of these FRBs, together with the probability distribution of $z$ given DM, to derive the lower limit on $E^{\\mathrm{max}}_{\\mathrm{iso}}$. We generate simulated FRB samples assuming different parameter values for a log-normal $\\mathrm{DM}_{\\mathrm{host}}$ distribution and a Schechter function form of the FRB energy function to estimate how many outliers -- FRBs with large DM contributions from the host galaxy or intervening galaxy halos -- could artificially inflate this limit. After accounting for outliers, the lower limit on $E^{\\mathrm{max}}_{\\mathrm{iso}}$ from Catalog 2 FRBs ranges between $1.2\\times10^{41}$ and $1.9\\times10^{42}$ erg, with best estimate $1.2\\times10^{42}$ erg. This limit is consistent with those derived from much smaller FRB samples. Moreover, inferred energies of hundreds of FRBs appear collectively limited around $\\sim10^{42}$ erg, suggesting a physical limit on the energy reservoir of FRB sources. The corresponding isotropic-equivalent FRB source energy is consistent with the total energy available in a magnetar's external dipole magnetic field, supporting magnetars as FRB progenitors.",

The surrogate ingests a six-parameter piecewise-polytropic representation $(\\log_{10}p_1,\\Gamma_1,\\Gamma_2,\\Gamma_3,\\rho_1,\\rho_2)$ -- with fixed transition densities $\\rho_1$ and $\\rho_2$ -- and jointly performs (i) validity classification under physical/observational constraints and (ii) regression of $M_{\\max}$, $R(M_{\\max})$, $R_{1.4}$, and $\\Lambda_{1.4}$. Trained on a balanced set of $40{,}000$ EoSs, the model attains near-perfect discrimination (AUC $\\approx 0.997$) and sub-percent relative errors for masses and radii, with few-percent error for tidal deformability. Across $\\alpha\\in[0.05,0.25]$, empirical coverages closely track $1-\\alpha$ for both Standard and Mondrian CP; in conservative regimes, Mondrian yields narrower average physical widths at comparable coverage. To our knowledge, this is the first application of class-conditioned (Mondrian) conformal calibration to neutron-star EoS surrogates, enabling efficient, reproducible, and uncertainty-aware inference; the framework is readily extensible to functional targets (e.g., full $R(M)$ curves).",

Enßlin, Philipp Frank, Tim Huege, Philipp Laub, Katharine Mulrey, Anna Nelles, Simon Strähnz, Satyendra Thoudam, Keito Watanabe High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The radio detection of extensive air showers provides a powerful method for studying the origin of high-energy cosmic rays. The Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) offers unprecedentedly detailed measurements of the radio emission footprint. However, fully exploiting this information requires advanced reconstruction techniques. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for air shower reconstruction based on Bayesian inference and Information Field Theory (IFT). Our method is built on a fully differentiable forward model of the radio signal, which incorporates a physical emission parameterization and a precise wavefront model. Additionally, we augment this physical model with Gaussian processes to account for systematic uncertainties in both the signal fluence and arrival timing. By leveraging gradient information, our approach enables efficient (three orders of magnitude acceleration w.r.t.\\ the legacy method) and robust inference of the underlying physical shower parameters, such as primary energy and the depth of shower maximum, $X_\\text{max}$. This work provides not only point estimates but also a rigorous quantification of uncertainties. We achieve a resolution in $X_\\text{max}$ of $25\\,\\mathrm{g/cm^2}$ and a radiation energy resolution of $12\\%$ on simulations for LOFAR.",

It is also known for its rapid X-ray variability, on timescales of kilo-seconds and has a complex, multi component wind in both the soft X-ray and Fe K bands. Here we present the first high resolution XRISM Resolve spectrum of NGC 4051, which was captured in a historically bright state for a 150 ks exposure. XRISM resolves two blue-shifted Fe K shell absorption troughs in the mean spectrum, which can be ascribed to H-like iron and arises from two outflow components with outflow velocities of 0.025c and 0.04c. A time dependent spectral analysis shows that the iron K absorption is variable on timescales of less than a day, increasing in velocity over the duration of the observation. The velocity changes may be explained either by the passage of two separate transiting absorbers, of different velocities, or by a single accelerating outflow of approximately constant column density. In the latter case, the wind acceleration is likely to be too large to be caused by radiation pressure and instead magnetic driving is favored to accelerate the wind up to 0.04c. The outflow can originate from an accretion disk wind, whose kinetic power is sub-Eddington in contrast to recent examples of winds from powerful, luminous quasars observed by XRISM.",

Polarization signatures offer a promising new avenue to discriminate between the various GRB prompt emission models. The aim of this study is to estimate energy and time resolved polarization signatures resulting from Inverse Compton (IC) scattering for two specific GRB prompt emission models, namely the backscatter-dominated cork model by \\citet{Vyas2} and a Compton drag model by \\citet{Lazzati2}. In order to achieve this we apply an IC polarization Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm to those two GRB models in order to estimate the expected polarization signatures. For the backscatter-dominated cork model we find polarization signatures below $\\sim 10$~\\%, likely below the detection limits of current or near-future X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray polarimeters. Our results for the Compton drag model indicates polarization results consistent with that found by \\citet{Lazzati3}. Furthermore, we find some energy and time dependence of the estimated polarization, particularly for the polarization angle.",

Kimura, Mainak Mukhopadhyay, Mukul Bhattacharya High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) High-energy multimessenger background analyses over the past decade have provided evidence for a population of hidden neutrino sources that are opaque to GeV-TeV gamma rays, a picture bolstered by recent observations of the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068. The coronal regions in the hearts of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been proposed as the most promising sites for such hidden nonthermal particle production, and NGC 1068 is expected to be the most neutrino-active galaxy for IceCube. We demonstrate that the latest all-sky neutrino spectrum, exhibiting a spectral bend around 3-30 TeV, is consistent with predictions of the magnetically powered corona scenario, and the models for the all-sky neutrino flux can simultaneously explain the multimessenger data from NGC 1068 within observational and modeling uncertainties. We further show, in a largely model-independent way, that the contribution from NGC 1068-like sources does not overshoot the observed medium-energy neutrino flux. Finally, we highlight the key role of the Eddington ratio, which can drive substantial variations in the predicted neutrino fluxes of nearby AGNs, and we encourage systematic multimessenger searches for the neutrino-brightest AGNs.",

Accepted for publication in ApJS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are characterized by strong temporal flux density variability across the electromagnetic spectrum, offering insights into the complex physical processes governing accretion and plasma outflows. To systematically investigate AGNs flux density variability in radio bands, a long-term program was initiated in late 2016: quasi-Simultaneous Multiwavelength Monitoring of gamma-ray-loud AGNs with the Nanshan 26-m radio telescope (SMMAN). This work presents the first data release of the SMMAN program, spanning over eight years from 2016 to 2024 with observations at 4.8 and 23.6 GHz. The SMMAN sample includes 131 northern ($\\delta >\\sim0^{\\circ}$) sources selected from the Fermi Large Area Telescope third source catalog. The characteristics of variability, spectral index, luminosity, and $\\gamma$-ray loudness factor are examined for different AGN classes within the sample. Target sources exhibit stronger variability at 23.6 GHz compared to 4.8 GHz, with BL Lac objects being more variable than flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). BL Lacs generally have flatter radio spectra, while FSRQs, blazar candidates of uncertain type (BCUs), and radio galaxies (RDGs) span a wider range from flat to steep. FSRQs are more radio-luminous than BL Lacs and other classes, with BCUs intermediate and RDGs generally fainter. FSRQs and BL Lacs have higher $\\gamma$-ray loudness factors than RDGs, while BCUs have intermediate values. The SMMAN dataset, incorporated with other historical and ongoing monitoring programs, will provide a unique opportunity to investigate the evolution of spectral energy distributions, search for quasi-periodic oscillations, and analyze supermassive black hole binary systems.",

SiPMs exhibit comparable or even higher photon detection efficiencies (PDEs) than PMTs. The sensitivity of a PMT matches well the spectral shape of Cherenkov radiation from extended air showers. In contrast to a PMT, the sensitivity of a SiPM is shifted toward longer wavelengths, where the intensity of light of night sky (LoNS), considered as unwanted noise, increases significantly. It is obvious that a SiPM with a higher PDE will indeed measure more Cherenkov light than a PMT, but it will also detect significantly higher LoNS noise; the question is which factor will predominate in the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). To compare the performance of a PMT with that of a SiPM, we built SiPM-based modules and installed these and operated in parallel in the imaging camera of the 17 m diameter MAGIC telescope. Our long-term studies show that SiPM, despite their higher PDE, can deliver only a comparable to PMT performance. As already the name SiPM suggests, we use these semiconductor sensors analogously to classical PMTs: We amplify their small signals, digitize, and calibrate the converted amplitudes. Although SiPM is essentially a digital sensor, its common-anode design does not allow one to directly profit from it. Numerous arrays of single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are being developed in various laboratories worldwide. Unlike SiPM, SPAD arrays digitize the incident photons from the outset and count their number. We will dwell on the potential further developments of SPADs.",

The analysis focused on 15 physical variables acquired by the Telescope Control Unit between September 2022 and July 2024, representing sensor measurements from the Azimuth and Elevation motors. After data cleaning, resampling, feature selection, and correlation analysis, the dataset was segmented into fixed-length intervals, in which the first I samples represented the input sequence provided to the model, while the forecast length, T, indicated the number of future time steps to be predicted. A sliding-window technique was then applied to increase the number of intervals. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) was trained to perform multivariate forecasting across all features simultaneously. Model performance was evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the Normalized Median Absolute Deviation (NMAD), and it was also benchmarked against a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The MLP model demonstrated consistent results across different features and I-T configurations, and matched the performance of the LSTM while converging faster. It achieved an MSE of 0.019+/-0.003 and an NMAD of 0.032+/-0.009 on the test set under its best configuration (4 hidden layers, 720 units per layer, and I-T lengths of 300 samples each, corresponding to 5 hours at 1-minute resolution). Extending the forecast horizon up to 6.5 hours-the maximum allowed by this configuration-did not degrade performance, confirming the model's effectiveness in providing reliable hour-scale predictions. The proposed NBM provides a powerful tool for enabling early anomaly detection in online ASTRI-Horn monitoring time series, offering a basis for the future development of a prognostics and health management system that supports predictive maintenance.",

In the spectra of the kilonova AT2017gfo, a P Cygni line at about 1$\\mu$m has been linked to Sr II, providing the first direct evidence of freshly synthesised $r$-process material. An alternative explanation to Sr II was proposed - He I $\\lambda 1083.3$nm under certain non-local-thermodynamic-equilibrium (NLTE) conditions. A key way to robustly discriminate between these identifications, and indeed other proposed identifications, is to analyse the temporal emergence and evolution of the feature. In this analysis we trace the earliest appearance of the observed feature and detail its spectro-temporal evolution, which we compare with a collisional-radiative model of helium. We show that the 1$\\mu$m P Cygni line is inconsistent with a He I interpretation both in emergence time and in subsequent spectral evolution. Self-consistent helium masses cannot reproduce the observed feature, due to the diminishing strength of radiative pathways leaving triplet helium.",

Based on the He I $\\lambda 1083.3$ nm line, we show that the feature around 800-1200 nm in AT2017gfo at 4.4 days seems inconsistent with a helium mass fraction of $X_{\\mathrm{He}} \\gtrsim 0.05$ in the polar ejecta. Our recent neutrino-hydrodynamic simulations of merger remnants are only compatible with this limit if the NS remnant collapses within 20-30 ms. Such a short lifetime implies that the total binary mass of GW170817, $M_\\mathrm{\\rm tot}$, lay close to the threshold binary mass for direct gravitational collapse, $M_\\mathrm{thres}$, for which we estimate $M_{\\mathrm{thres}}\\lesssim 2.93 M_\\odot$. This upper bound on $M_\\mathrm{thres}$ yields upper limits on the radii and maximum mass of cold, non-rotating NSs, which rule out simultaneously large values for both quantities. In combination with causality arguments, this result implies a maximum NS mass of $M_\\mathrm{max}\\lesssim2.3 M_\\odot$. The combination of all limits constrains the radii of 1.6 M$_\\odot$ NSs to about 12$\\pm$1 km for $M_\\mathrm{max}$ = 2.0 M$_\\odot$ and 11.5$\\pm$1 km for $M_\\mathrm{max}$ = 2.15 M$_\\odot$. This $\\sim2$ km allowable range then tightens significantly for $M_\\mathrm{max}$ above $\\approx2.15$ M$_\\odot$. This rules out a significant number of current EoS models. The short NS lifetime also implies that a black-hole torus, not a highly magnetized NS, was the central engine powering the relativistic jet of GRB170817A. Our work motivates future developments...

Here, we demonstrate the post-glitch recovery of these glitches within the framework of the vortex creep model. We further present the investigation of vortex residuals (the discrepancy between observed values and those predicted by the vortex creep model) by interpreting them in the context of the vortex bending model. In addition, we report a positive correlation between the glitch magnitude and the time to the next glitch, applicable only for the large glitch events observed in the Vela pulsar.

Shukla Comments are welcome, to be submitted soon High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) generate powerful relativistic jets that inject a large amount of energy into their surrounding environment, producing blast waves that accelerate particles to high energies. The GRB afterglow radiation provides a powerful means to investigate the microphysics of relativistic shocks and to probe the medium surrounding the progenitor of the burst. In this study, we present a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis of 31 GRBs observed between 2008 and 2024 from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (X-ray Telescope and Burst Alert Telescope) and the Fermi Large Area Telescope, covering photon energies from 0.3 keV to 300 GeV. Our goal is to characterize the broadband spectral properties of GRB afterglows in soft X-rays, hard X-rays, and high-energy gamma rays. We investigate correlations between spectral shape and energy output across different parts of the spectrum. The observed emission is modeled using a forward shock scenario that includes both synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) radiation losses. The results favor an SSC-dominated radiation model in a wind-like medium, consistent with expectations for long-duration GRBs. Crucially, this work provides new benchmarks for the microphysical parameters governing the emission, particularly indicating a notably low magnetic energy fraction, which refines previous estimates. By modeling broadband data, this study offers one of the most detailed SSC analyses in a wind-like environment to date. Notably, our results naturally account for the comparable energy output observed in both the soft X-ray and TeV bands, consistent with the previously detected TeV-GRBs.",

Hendriks 15 pages, version after first ApJL revision. Comments are very welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The detected Gaia systems hosting compact objects challenge standard models of binary star evolution. In particular, if the observed black hole (BH) systems evolved in isolation, they are expected to have undergone a mass transfer phase. Given their highly unequal masses, such mass transfer is dynamically unstable within standard models, leading to a stellar merger or a short-period binary. In contrast, the observed systems have much wider orbits than predicted, making their formation within conventional evolutionary frameworks difficult to reconcile. Using detailed binary evolution calculations, we test whether non-conservative mass transfer, in which most of the mass is lost from the system carrying the specific angular momentum of the donor's center of mass, can explain the properties of two Gaia BH systems. This mass-loss geometry differs from standard isotropic re-emission from the accretor's vicinity. We find that our mass-loss geometry model reproduces the orbital periods of the two Gaia BH systems remarkably well over a wide range of initial conditions, offering a plausible formation pathway. We speculate this may point to enhanced eruptive mass loss, potentially driven by high-opacity subsurface layers in the donor prior to Roche-lobe overflow, consistent with preferentially bipolar outflows observed in luminous blue variables. Alternatively, it may indicate the need for more sophisticated mass-transfer prescriptions that account for highly unequal Roche-lobe sizes, sub-synchronous rotation, and possible self-accretion. Similar mechanisms may operate in other post-mass-transfer systems facing analogous evolutionary challenges, including Gaia neutron-star and white-dwarf binaries, stripped-envelope Wolf-Rayet stars, and low-mass X-ray binaries.",

Although the physical origin of the plateau remains uncertain, the magnetar energy injection model offers a compelling explanation that reproduces the observed temporal and luminosity features. However, previous studies relying solely on X-ray data have suffered from strong parameter degeneracies when constraining the magnetar parameters. Here we perform broadband afterglow modeling on seven short GRBs with plateau features by combining X-ray, optical, and radio observations within the framework of the magnetar energy injection model. Key model parameters are derived by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. It is found that the energy injection substantially modifies the afterglow dynamics in most events. Compared with X-ray-only analyses, our broadband modeling yields systematically a lower magnetic field strength and a shorter spin period for the central magnetar, corresponding to a higher injection luminosity. The study clearly shows that incorporating multi-wavelength data effectively alleviates the degeneracy between the magnetar parameters and X-ray radiative efficiency. In addition, the distribution of our short GRBs differs markedly from long GRBs when they are plotted on the initial Lorentz factor versus gamma-ray energy plane. This offset, consistent with the observed harder spectrum of short GRBs, may serve as a useful diagnostic for investigating the progenitor as larger samples are available.",

Gourgouliatos 12 pages, 8 figures, accepted by Astronomy and Astrophysics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) Magnetar flares are highly energetic and rare events in which intense X and {\\gamma}-ray emission is released from strongly magnetised neutron stars. The events are also accompanied by mass ejection from the neutron star. Fast radio bursts are short and intense pulses of coherent radio emission. Their large dispersion measures support an extragalactic origin. While their exact origin still remains elusive, a substantial number of models associates them with strong magnetic field and high-energy relativistic plasma found in the vicinity of magnetars. There is growing evidence that some fast radio bursts are associated with flare-type events from magnetars. We provide a set of configurations describing a relativistic, spherical, magnetic plasmoid explosion. We proceed by solving the equations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics for a system that expands while maintaining its internal equilibrium. We find the interdependent relation between pressure, mass density, Lorentz factor, and magnetic field that determines the detailed properties of the solutions. A dichotomy of solutions exists that correspond to higher and lower density and thermal pressure compared to the external one. For stronger toroidal magnetic fields, the maximum permitted expansion velocity becomes lower than the weaker toroidal fields. These solution classes can be applied to magnetar giant flares and fast radio bursts. Those that corresponding to over densities and higher pressure can be associated with magnetar flares, and those corresponding to underdensities can be relevant to fast radio bursts that correspond to magnetically dominated events with low mass loading.

No changes to v_1 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Context. Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are rare transients that provide important insights into the physics of galactic nuclei. A recently identified feature in their optical light curves is the presence of early bump-like structures (precursors) that appear before the onset of the main flare or during its rise. Aims. We aim to build and study the first sample of precursor TDEs in order to improve our understanding of these features, which could be key to revealing the origin of the optical emission in TDEs. Methods. We compiled all known precursor TDEs from the literature, searched for additional candidates, and analyzed them as a sample. Results. We find that precursor TDEs predominantly fall within the repeating TDE, fast TDE, and TDE in active galactic nucleus (AGN) subclasses. We reveal a positive correlation between the occurrence time of the precursors relative to the main peak and the central black hole mass. Conclusions. We suggest that the precursors appear due to interactions between the incoming stellar debris and the disk or leftover material from an earlier disruption (repeating and fast TDEs) or a stable pre-existing disk (TDEs in AGNs). Precursors are therefore potentially key signatures of repeating partial TDEs in previously quiescent galaxies.",

Submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present Very Large Telescope/X-Shooter spectroscopy for the host galaxies of 12 fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected by the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) observed through the ESO Large Programme \"FURBY\", which imposes strict selection criteria on the included FRBs and their host galaxies to produce a homogeneous and well-defined sample. We describe the data reduction and analysis of these spectra and report their redshifts, line-emission fluxes, and derived host properties. From the present sample, this paper focuses on the faint host of FRB ($m_R = 22.53 \\pm 0.02$) identified at low redshift ($z=0.1050$). This indicates an intrinsically very low-luminosity galaxy ($L \\approx 10^8 L_\\odot$), making it the lowest-luminosity non-repeating FRB host to date by a factor of $\\sim 3$, and slightly dimmer than the lowest-luminosity host for repeating FRBs. Our SED fitting analysis reveals a low stellar mass ($M_* \\approx 10^{8.0} M_\\odot$), low star formation rate (${\\rm SFR} \\approx 0.04 M_\\odot \\rm yr^{-1}$), and very low metallicity ($12+\\log(\\text{O}/\\text{H})\\sim(8.0-8.3)$), distinct from the more massive galaxies ($\\log(M/M_\\odot) \\sim 10$) that are commonly identified for non-repeating FRBs. Its discovery demonstrates that FRBs can arise in among the faintest, metal-poor galaxies of the universe. In turn, this suggests that at least one FRB progenitor channel must include stars (or their remnants) created in very low metallicity environments. This indicates better prospects for detecting FRBs from the high-$z$ universe where young, low-mass galaxies proliferate.",

The star M31-2014-DS1 in the Andromeda galaxy was reported to exhibit such a disappearance between 2014 and 2022, with properties consistent with the failed explosion of a $\\approx 12 - 13$ M$_\\odot$ yellow supergiant leading to the formation of a $\\approx 5$ M$_\\odot$ BH. We present mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the remnant obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and X-ray observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory in 2024. The JWST MIRI/NIRSpec data reveal an extremely red source, showing strong blueshifted absorption from molecular gas (CO, CO$_2$, H$_2$O, SO$_2$) and deep silicate dust features. Modeling the dust continuum confirms continued bolometric fading of the central source to $\\log(L/L_\\odot)\\approx3.88$ ($\\approx7-8$% of the progenitor luminosity), surrounded by a dust shell spanning $\\approx40-200$ au. Modeling of the molecular gas indicates $\\sim 0.1$ M$_\\odot$ of gas expanding at $\\approx 100$ km s$^{-1}$ near the inner edge of the dust shell. No X-ray source is detected down to a luminosity limit of $L_X\\lesssim1.5\\times10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We show that the panchromatic observations are explained by (i) a low-energy ($\\approx10^{46}$ erg) ejection of the outer H-rich progenitor envelope and (ii) a fading central BH powered by inefficient ($\\sim0.1$% in mass) accretion of loosely bound fallback material. The analysis robustly establishes the bolometric fading of M31-2014-DS1 and provides the first cohesive insights into BH formation via low-energy explosions and long-term fallback.",

If the companion is a neutron star, it would be the most massive known; if a black hole, it would be the closest to Earth. This system provides a unique laboratory for studying asteroseismology in strong gravitational fields, as well as the formation and evolution of extremely eccentric binaries. Our work demonstrates the use of the light-travel time effect in a pulsating star to reveal a compact companion, offering a novel method for detecting black holes in non-interacting binaries.",

Roman-Lopes, Jonah Otto, Diogo Souto, Keivan Staussan, Guy S. Stringfellow Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Using SDSS-V DR19 Milky Way Mapper APOGEE data, we measure the impact that close binarity has on surface chemistry across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram in a broad set of abundances by studying single-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB1s) in open clusters. We derive binary membership and orbital parameters for 103 SB1s by analysing APOGEE radial velocities with The Joker and UltraNest. We perform a detailed abundance analysis with BACCHUS to derive abundances in fourteen chemical species: Si, Fe, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, Ce, and Nd. Leveraging the assumptions of chemical homogeneity in open clusters, we compare the surface abundances of SB1s to non-binary stars at similar evolutionary states. We find that a subset of binaries with significant UV excess have a $\\Delta$[C/N] that is 0.2--0.5 dex higher than expected, resulting in overestimated [C/N]-based ages for those stars. This points to pollution from an evolved companion and has implications for [C/N]-based age studies of the broader Milky Way. At the population level, we find that SB1s in our sample can be treated as statistically chemically homogeneous with their single-star counterparts, and we find no connection between orbital separation and chemical enrichment or depletion. We show that at separations up to ~5 pc, co-eval stars can be considered chemically homogeneous with one another within current abundance precisions, regardless of multiplicity.",

O'Leary, Rachel S. Somerville, Greg L. Bryan 27 Pages, 12 figures. Submitted to ApJ. The manuscript has passed the first referee round. A public GitHub repository will be made available upon publication Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Recent JWST observations reveal massive, UV-bright galaxies at $z > 10$ with little apparent dust attenuation, whereas ALMA detections at $z \\simeq 7$ show similarly massive systems that are already dust-rich and IR-luminous. This raises a fundamental question: can a single physical model of star formation and dust production explain both populations across cosmic time? We address this using a minimal framework with only two free parameters--the instantaneous star formation efficiency ($\\epsilon_\\star$) and the dust yield per Type II supernova ($y_d$)--and predict the rest-frame UV and IR luminosity functions (LFs) from $z \\simeq 14$ to 7. For a uniform ISM, we find a UV-IR tension at the bright end of the LFs at $z \\ge 7$. The UV LF requires low dust yields ($y_d \\lesssim 0.01\\,M_\\odot$), whereas the $z=7$ IR LF requires higher yields ($y_d \\sim 0.1\\,M_\\odot$) unless the star formation efficiency is boosted above $\\epsilon_\\star \\approx 5$-10%. We show that incorporating a porous, turbulent ISM largely resolves this tension: turbulence opens low-column-density sightlines that enhance the UV escape fraction while leaving the total absorbed energy--and thus the IR luminosity--nearly unchanged once radiative-transfer--induced flattening of the attenuation curve is included. Large-grain dust distributions, while reducing UV opacity, play a secondary role once ISM porosity and radiative transfer are taken into account. At $z > 10$, however, even strong turbulence cannot reproduce the bright end of the UV LF at high dust yield. This could be resolved either by efficient dust removal in early massive systems or by substantial ISM dust growth by $z \\simeq 7$. Our results highlight dust physics as a key lever for interpreting the rapidly growing UV and IR constraints within the broader context of early galaxy formation.",

From a multi-wavelength SED analysis we establish the sample has a a median stellar mass of $\\rm\\log_{10}(M_\\ast/M_\\odot)=10.8\\pm0.1$ and dust mass of $\\rm\\log_{10}(M_{\\rm d}/M_\\odot)=8.7\\pm0.1$, covering a broad range of far-infrared luminosity $\\rm (\\log_{10}(L_{FIR}/L_\\odot)=10.9-12.7)$. The majority of sources show no signs of AGN activity, with 40% having either X-ray counterparts $(\\rm L_{Xc}>10^{42}erg/s)$, elevated optical line ratios, or broad (FWHM>800 km/s) H$\\alpha$ profiles, although we note this is a lower limit due to the stochastic placement of NIRSpec slits. We establish the sample has a median gas-phase metallicity of $12+\\log({\\rm O/H})=8.71\\pm0.02$, as derived from the [NII]/H$\\alpha$ ratio, with the most FIR-luminous galaxies ($\\rm\\log_{10}(L_{\\rm FIR}/L_\\odot)>12$) falling $0.15\\pm0.03$dex above the fundamental metallicity relation.

Our results indicate that luminous far-infrared galaxies are massive, chemically evolved systems that appear to deviate from the standard dust and metal production equilibrium observed in less obscured galaxies. This study demonstrates the synergy of JWST and ALMA in unveiling the nature of DSFGs, and highlights the need for a NIRSpec survey of uniformly selected, massive, dust-obscured, galaxies to fully characterise their interstellar medium.",

To evaluate their accuracy and limitations, we generate synthetic HI Zeeman spectra from magnetohydrodynamic simulations and idealized cloud models, and analyze the resulting Stokes I and V profiles using two complementary methods. Approach I uses the classical relation between Stokes V and dI/d{\\nu} to estimate LOS-averaged magnetic fields, achieving an upper-limit relative error of 16% (half-width of 68.27% confidence interval) for a representative noise level of 0.014 K. Approach II applies Gaussian decomposition to Stokes I and V to estimate component-level magnetic fields, yielding a 13% relative error quantifying the same confidence range, reflecting the intrinsic uncertainty of such Zeeman estimates. Both approaches recover the original fields under uniform-field conditions and remain robust in turbulent environments. Approach I provides a simple and reliable LOS-averaged field estimate, while Approach II, although more complex, offers statistical insight into magnetic field variations along the LOS. We further show that joint fitting of Stokes I and V generally outperforms sequential fitting, particularly in the presence of attenuation. Increasing noise eight-fold produces a more modest rise in uncertainty, doubling to a 26% relative error, while substantial optical depth introduces only a minor additional contribution to the overall uncertainty. Applying these methods to FAST observations of the L1544 star-forming region, we confirm the previously reported LOS magnetic field strength, demonstrating the validity of Zeeman analysis in this benchmark core.",

In this study, we investigate the application of deep learning (DL) frameworks to characterize different galactic substructures hosted within parametric light-profile subtracted ``residual'' images of a large sample galaxies from the CANDELS survey. We develop a supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and unsupervised Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CvAE) and train it on the single-Sérsic profile fitting based residual images of $10,046$ bright and massive galaxies ($H<24.5\\,{\\rm mag}$ and $M_{\\rm stellar} \\geq 10^{9.5}\\,M_{\\odot}$) spanning $1<z<3$, in conjunction with their visual-based classification labels indicating the nature of residual substructures hosted within them. Using our unique data preprocessing approach, we prepare our residual images such that the inputs to our DL networks comprise only ``galaxy of interest'', and augment them such that our sample span uniformly across different residual characteristics. We assess the latent space of the CNN and CvAE using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) along with independently quantified metrics of residual strength (significant pixel flux $SPF$, Bumpiness, and Residual Flux Fraction). We also employ an unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) based clustering scheme with Support Vector Classification (SVC) to identify groupings in PCA space that correspond to similar residual substructure. We find that our supervised CNN latent features in PCA space correlate with the $SPF$ values and distinguish between qualitatively strong and weak residual substructures. While our unsupervised CvAE latent space also correlates with visual and quantitative residual characteristics, but lacks clear discriminatory power when characterizing different residual substructures.",

We identify 79 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members with reliable radio emission and classify them into compact, extended, and tailed subsamples according to their radio morphologies. By combining their radio and optical properties, we find compact radio sources are predominantly associated with massive, quiescent galaxies driven by AGN activity, while tailed sources are largely hosted by star-forming galaxies, tracing ongoing ram pressure stripping (RPS). Using phase-space analysis and a projected infall time proxy ($d_R$), we find that extended sources are preferentially located in the cluster outskirts ($d_R > 1$), while tailed sources are concentrated in the intermediate infall region ($0.4 < d_R < 1.0$), highlighting the influence of the dense intracluster medium.",

      "abstract": "Feedback shaped the galaxy morphological sequence in presence of mergers Masafumi Noguchi Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Bulges and disks are major structural components that define galaxy morphology. The mass ratios of bulges and disks increase statistically with the galaxy mass, with the high-mass end occupied by elliptical galaxies. Although previous theoretical studies have succeeded in reproducing this morphological sequence, it is not yet fully understood why and how this morphological sequence emerged. Galaxy mergers accompanying dark matter halo mergers have been proposed as the major route for bulge formation. On the other hand, it is observationally known that the mass fraction of galaxies (stars plus cold gas) in dark matter halos attains the peak value at $M_{\\rm halo} \\sim 10^{12} {\\rm M}_\\odot$ throughout the cosmic time. Using a simple galaxy evolution model including mergers, we show that this feature is the fundamental cause of the morphological sequence. Halos hosting massive galaxies, which stay more massive than this peak mass for long periods during their growth, merge mostly with satellite halos having larger galaxy mass fractions than themselves. Such mergers increase the bulge mass fraction efficiently. In contrast, host halos of low-mass galaxies evolve under unfavorable condition for bulge growth because they stay below the peak mass and merge with satellite halos with smaller galaxy mass fractions. Previous studies suggest that the peak in galaxy mass fraction is created by feedback processes from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and young massive stars including supernovae (SN), which are considered to suppress star formation in high-mass and low-mass galaxies, respectively. This study thus points to a close relationship between the galaxy morphology and feedback processes which have hitherto been considered unrelated and suggests the importance of further investigation into their causal relationship.",

To better understand the formation of the Milky Way and other spiral galaxies, we characterize the chemical and kinematic properties of halo substructures using GALAH DR4 and Gaia data. We apply wavelet transforms in the space of sqrt(J_r) and azimuthal action (L_z) to identify kinematic overdensities. Stars in the detected structures are analyzed in elemental abundance space to determine their origin. We further assess contamination using the unsupervised machine-learning algorithm t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), performing chemical tagging with 15 elemental abundances. We recover five structures: the Galactic disk, the Splash, Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), Thamnos1, and Thamnos2. GSE shows two peaks; one at sqrt(J_r) ~ 25 kpc km s^-1 is due to disk contamination, while the other above sqrt(J_r) ~ 40 kpc km s^-1 represents the cleanest GSE population. Thamnos exhibits three peaks linked to Thamnos1 and Thamnos2. Thamnos2 shows higher [alpha/Fe], iron-peak elements are enhanced in the Splash, and halo groups retain a stronger r-process signature. The multiply peaked structures suggest that the splashed disk extends beyond prograde orbits. The distinct chemo-dynamical properties of the halo groups support their extragalactic origin.",

Specifically, we aim to constrain the behavior of {\\alpha}-element enhancements with metallicity, the dependence of [{\\alpha}/Fe] on the specific star formation rate (sSFR), and the absorption-line velocity widths ({\\Delta}v90) vs. stellar mass, {\\Delta}v90 vs. metallicity, and mass-metallicity relations. For the comparison, we select five galaxies simulated with the chemodynamical Tree-SPH code GEAR with stellar masses in the range of log(M*/Msol) between 6.1 and 10.8, and at six different redshifts between 0.33 and 4.12. We find that the abundance ratios [{\\alpha}/Fe] and [M/H] observed in the interstellar medium (ISM) of DLA galaxies overlap with the abundance trends in gas of the simulated galaxies. Our findings corroborate a picture in which DLAs with {\\Delta}v90 below and above 100 km/s trace galaxies with masses in the ranges of log M* 6 - 8 and 8 - 11 solar masses, respectively. We suggest that observations should be used with caution when constraining the theoretical [{\\alpha}/Fe] vs. sSFR relations because of systematics (if abundances are obtained from emission lines) or differences in the gas properties as probed by a DLA and its counterpart. So far, only the observations in absorption of inner gas of the LMC and SMC are in agreement with the simulated data. We confirm that DLAs detected at large impact parameters most likely probe the gas of satellite or other halo galaxies which are adjacent to the central galaxy. We further find that the velocity widths vs. stellar masses and mass-metallicity relations agree well with observations, while GEAR should be calibrated more carefully to reproduce the {\\Delta}v90 vs. metallicity relation.",

Rarivoarinoro, Zara Randriamanakoto, Russ Taylor, Marisa Brienza, Fabio Luchsinger, Sushant Dutta, Catherine Hale, Jacinta Delhaize, Ndivhuwo Netshiavha, Solohery Randriamampandry, Mattia Vaccari 16 pages + appendix materials (4 pages), Accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Triple-double radio galaxies (TDRGs) are amongst the rarest subpopulations of radio galaxies (RGs). They are characterised by three pairs of radio lobes, where each pair of lobes represents an episode of nuclear activity. Such a feature makes them key objects that can be used to constrain the duty cycle of RGs. In this paper, we report the discovery of J022248\\m060934, a new TDRG, hosted by a galaxy at a spectroscopic redshift of $z \\approx$ 0.94. We have used the MIGHTEE-DR1 data set and MIGHTEE sub-band images as our main data. In total intensity, J022248\\m060934 has a bright core and triple-double, edge-brightened-like peaks of radio emission. The polarimetry of the source reveals an inhomogeneous density of the hosting environment which is consistent with the more pronounced bending in its eastern lobes. The spectral index and curvature maps suggest an inverted core and an ultra-steepening of the spectrum towards the outer lobes which reinforce a recurrent nuclear activity. We perform individual spectral age fitting of the components of the source using the JP model and we found a lower limit total age of $\\sim$16 Myr. We also derive a short inactive period between the active phases and a rapid duty cycle of 90 per cent for the first cycle of activity. Our spectral ageing analysis suggests that the triple-double structure in TDRGs is not the product of long quiescent periods, as deduced by previous works based on kinematic ages.",

We aim to investigate the morphological stability of 1,490 OCs and further explore the potential change of morphological stability of the OCs at different spatial positions, using the OC catalog from the literature. We define for the first time a new morphological stability parameter Ncore/Nouter, a ratio of member numbers between cluster core and outer areas within tidal radii, which has a significant positive correlation against N, with a slope of 1.140\\pm0.039, significantly steeper than the 0.720\\pm0.026 measured for Score/Souter. This demonstrates that the stellar density in the core is a more sensitive tracer for morphological stability than geometry. Spatially, the radial sample OCs have larger slopes of Ncore/Nouter and Score/Souter against N, with 1.083\\pm0.116 and 0.733\\pm0.080, respectively, whereas those in the tangential direction 1.013\\pm0.110 and 0.529\\pm0.075, respectively, which means that the impact on sample OCs from tidal forces directed toward the Galactic center is possibly stronger than that from the shear force caused by the differential rotation of the Galactic disk. Besides, the sample OCs younger than 30 Myr display a shallow slope of 0.751\\pm0.166, with those older than 800 Myr (1.442\\pm0.128), reflecting that young OCs likely endure both internal disruptions, such as early dynamical heating weakening core binding and more severe external disturbances, compared to older OCs.",

Michelucci 16 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The Milky Way (MW) stellar halo, containing debris from past accretion events, serves as a fossil record of hierarchical mass assembly. Due to their distinct properties, RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) serve as excellent tracers for identifying and characterising the halo's substructures. We analysed a sample of 4933 RRLs, for which we calculated the integrals of motion and orbital parameters. We applied the domain-informed novelty detection CLustering in Multiphase Boundaries (CLiMB) framework to identify RRL membership in the MW substructures. We analysed the metallicity distributions of RRLs in major accreted system remnants as a snapshot of their chemical evolutionary status during early epochs. We calculated the weighted mean metallicity ([Fe/H]) and the corresponding standard deviation for Gaia Sausage/Enceladus ([Fe/H] = $-1.57 \\pm 0.25$ dex), Sequoia ([Fe/H] =$ -1.64\\pm0.26$ dex), and the Helmi streams ([Fe/H] = $-1.66\\pm0.19$ dex). The metallicity distribution of RRLs in Thamnos was found to be bimodal, with the metal-poor peak likely representing the genuine accreted Thamnos population ([Fe/H] = $-1.94\\pm0.20$ dex), in agreement with recent works based on spectroscopic abundances. Our analysis shows that the substructures ED-1 and L-RL3 are highly contaminated by thick disc stars. However, the metal-poor tails in their metallicity distributions may be signatures of remnants from small accreted systems. We also identify over-densities of RRLs in correspondence with the recently reported substructures Shiva and Shakti, which we suggest are of in-situ origin. Finally, we applied the RRL-based mass-metallicity relation of galaxies to test the nature of the identified dynamical substructures.",

They can form either internally, via dynamical instabilities, or externally, triggered by interactions with other galaxies. The impact of mergers on bar formation and survival, however, has not been thoroughly investigated. To explore the influence of mergers on bars, we construct a suite of \\textit{N}-body merger pairs where a Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus-like radially biased satellite disk galaxy merges with a central disk galaxy during its bar formation. With the central galaxy fixed, the satellite varies in merger parameters: the mass ratio $m/M$ relative to the central galaxy, the impact parameter $b$, and the orbital inclination angle $\\theta_i$ relative to the central disk. We find that the bar survival probability decreases with increasing $m/M$. Mergers with $m/M\\lesssim1/10$ generally preserve the forming bar, whereas those with ${m/M}\\geq1/2$ tend to destroy it, producing more early-type-like remnants. For intermediate mass ratios ($1/5 \\leq m/M \\leq 1/3$), several models yield ``weakening bars'', in which the bar survives the merger but gradually decays during subsequent secular evolution, possibly due to interactions between nested double bars formed from merger debris. In contrast to $m/M$, $b$ and $\\theta_i$ have only secondary and stochastic effects on bar survival. The different influences of these three merger parameters can be naturally explained by the tidal force exerted by the satellite on the forming bar, which tends to weaken the bar when the satellite crosses it nearly perpendicular to its major axis.",

CRs can dissociate the molecules on dust grains, producing reactive suprathermal species and radicals which facilitate the formation of large molecules. We add the radiolysis process and some relevant reactions into the Nautilus astrochemical code. By adjusting some parameters, we investigate the sensitivity of the simulation results of the H2O ice on the removal of reaction-diffusion competition, the removal of non-diffusive chemistry, and the desorption energies of the suprathermal species. We find the model, with a few adjustments of the chemistry, can reproduce the steady-state [H2O2]/[H2O] and [O3]/[O2]_0 abundance ratios in the H2O and O2 radiolysis experiments at any CR flux in the experiments. These adjustments in the model do not fully reproduce the fluence required to reach the steady state. It tends also to overestimate the destruction of H2O as measured in H2O radiolysis experiments. We show that reducing the G-values of H2O radiolysis, which implies an increase in the efficiency of immediate reformation of water locally after ion impact, leads to simulated H2O destruction rates closer to the experiments. The effect of reaction-diffusion competition on the simulation results of H2O ice is significant at $\\zeta \\lesssim 10^{-14}\\ \\rm s^{-1}$. The non-diffusive chemistry affects the simulation results at 16 K but not 77K, while the results are sensitive to the desorption energies of suprathermal H, O, O3 and OH at 77 K. Our results show that the steady-state [H2O2]/[H2O] and [O3]/[O2]_0 in experiments can be reproduced by fine-tuning the chemical model, but still call for more constraints on the intermediate pathways in the radiolysis processes, especially the ion chemistry in the ice bulk, as well as activation barriers and branching ratios of the reactions in the network.",

Martin 18 pages (5 pages Appendix), 22 Figures. Submitted to A&A: accepted for publication after minor revision Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Galaxy major mergers are a potential mechanism for triggering active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity, but their role remains debated, particularly beyond the local Universe. We aim to shed light on the merger-AGN connection at $z=0.5$-$2$, exploiting the multi-wavelength datasets and {\\it James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) observations in the COSMOS field. We construct a stellar mass-limited sample and identify AGN via mid-infrared (MIR) colours, X-ray detections, and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. We train convolutional neural networks to identify mergers with mock JWST observations. We create non-AGN and non-merger control samples matching the redshift, stellar mass, and star-formation rate distributions of the AGN and mergers. We find AGN to be moderately more frequent in mergers than in non-mergers, with excess ratios ranging from $\\sim2.5$ (X-ray AGN) to $\\sim1.3$ (MIR) and $\\sim 1.1$-1.2 (SED AGN). Similarly, AGN galaxies show a higher merger fraction ($f_{merg}$) than non-AGN controls. We then study $f_{merg}$ as a function of relative and absolute AGN power, utilising the AGN fraction ($f_{AGN}$) and accretion disc luminosity (L$_{disc}$) parameters. We uncover a $f_{merg}$-$f_{AGN}$ relation with two regimes: $f_{merg}$ stays roughly flat for less-dominant AGN ($f_{AGN}<0.8$) but increases at $f_{AGN}>0.8$ for the MIR and X-ray AGN, and more gently for SED AGN, where mergers appear to be the main triggering mechanism. Additionally, $f_{merg}$ increases monotonically as a function of L$_{disc}$, for all AGN types, reaching $f_{merg}>50\\%$ for the most luminous AGN (L$_{disc} \\gtrsim 10^{46}\\,{erg\\,s^{-1}}$). Overall, our results suggest that major mergers can trigger AGN out to the cosmic noon at $z\\sim2$. Furthermore, the role of major mergers shows a clear dependence on AGN luminosity and remains the principal mechanism for fuelling the most powerful AGN.",

An independent Gr (R band) time-series photometry data set, using two different apertures from MPC station L92, analyzed with nightly offsets and 30 minute binning, gives Pphot = 7.136 +/- 0.001 h (formal 1sigma), with a semiamplitude A about 0.311 mag and scatter sigmajit about 0.089 mag. The close agreement beetwen the periods supports a characteristic post-perihelion period of about 7.1 h. We interpret this period as an attitude precession/nutation (non principal axis rotation) traced by jet orientation and coma flux redistribution.

Scaife Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Modern astronomical surveys are producing progressively larger and more complex datasets, making traditional supervised approaches that rely on extensive labelled catalogues increasingly difficult. Consequently, pre-training using self-supervised learning (SSL), which offers a scalable route by extracting structure directly from unlabelled images, is becoming attractive for many downstream applications. In this work we consider the use of coupled self-supervised representation learning approaches for radio galaxy morphology pre-training. In order to account for the more nuanced variations in radio galaxy morphology than are typically included in the augmented views of view-based SSL algorithms, we use a pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate views for training a larger view-based self-supervised model. To do this, a $\\beta$-VAE was trained on the Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) dataset, where moderate regularization ($\\beta = 2.3$) was found to provide a good balance between reconstruction quality and disentanglement of generative factors such as source multiplicity and lobe asymmetry. An analysis of the $\\beta$-VAE reveals that Fanaroff-Riley class identity manifests as a continuous transition across the latent space, rather than being associated to a single discrete dimension. $\\beta$-VAE reconstructions were then incorporated as generative augmentations within a view-based SSL pipeline. Our experiments show that combining these generative views with standard image augmentations improves downstream classification performance, and we present ablation studies clarifying the relative contribution of each augmentation type. These results indicate that generative and contrastive approaches are complementary, and point toward disentanglement-aware self-supervised learning as a promising direction for future radio astronomy surveys.",

Access to the machine-readable tables may be found at: this https URL Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The fundamental parameters of a low-mass star can potentially be determined from its photometry and astrometry. This is complicated by the fact that 10-20 percent of low-mass stars are predicted to be equal-mass binaries. These unresolved systems appear more luminous compared to single stars with the same fundamental parameters. We present a method to differentiate binary stars from single-star main sequence K and M dwarfs using their \\textit{Gaia} DR3 XP spectra. We assemble a training set of stars which have pristine astrometry and photometry, are located within 100pc of the Sun, and exclude stars with \\textit{Gaia} DR3 flags suggesting they may be unequal mass systems, thereby leaving stars that are predominantly either single- or equal-mass binaries. We then iteratively train Random Forest Regression (RFR) models to predict absolute magnitude and color given the RP spectral coefficients of a star. After each model, we remove the stars that have absolute magnitudes significantly brighter than their predicted values. This method converges on a model trained only on single stars. We then use this model to identify the ``overluminous'' K and M stars in \\textit{Gaia} DR3 within 100 parsecs, with some quality cuts. We find that $\\sim13\\%$ of the sample is significantly overluminous and assume these to be unresolved binaries. We aggregate several multiplicity surveys across different projected separations and incorporate our overluminous binaries to create a general \\textit{Catalog of Systems} within 100 pc. We use this \\textit{Catalog} to provide lower limits on the multiplicity fraction for stars between $0.1$ and $0.7~M_{\\odot}$.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Accurate chemical compositions of star-forming regions are a critical diagnostic tool to characterize the star formation history and gas flows which regulate galaxy formation. However, the abundance discrepancy factor (ADF) between measurements from the \"direct\" optical electron temperature ($T_e$) method and from the recombination lines (RL) represents $\\sim0.2$ dex systematic uncertainty in oxygen abundance. The degree of uncertainty for other elements is unknown. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of O$^{++}$ and N$^+$ ion abundances using optical and far-infrared spectra of a star-forming region within the nearby dwarf galaxy Haro 3, which exhibits a typical ADF. Assuming homogeneous conditions, the far-IR emission indicates an O abundance which is higher than the $T_e$ method and consistent with the RL value, as would be expected from temperature fluctuations, whereas the far-IR N abundance is too large to be explained by temperature fluctuations. A two-phase analytical model reveals that differential dust obscuration associated with temperature inhomogeneity is likely required to explain all the emission line ratios, and that the total oxygen metallicity of two phases is consistent with the RL metallicity. Our findings underscore the critical importance of resolving the cause of abundance discrepancies and understanding the biases between different metallicity methods. This work represents a promising methodology, and we identify further approaches to address the current dominant uncertainties.",

Lange, Xianghao Ma 11 pages, 9 figures, published in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) is central to understanding the co-evolution of galaxies and their host dark matter haloes, yet it remains weakly constrained for dwarf galaxies owing to their faintness, especially beyond the Local Group. Strong gravitational lensing offers a unique probe of the SHMR at sub-galactic scales and cosmological distances, as the masses of subhalos within the main lens can be inferred from the perturbations they imprint on lensed images. Anticipating the discovery of $\\sim10^5$ galaxy--galaxy strong lenses by forthcoming facilities such as \\textit{Euclid}, we perform an end-to-end simulation to forecast \\textit{Euclid}'s constraints on the SHMR at the halo mass scale of $\\sim10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. We generate mock \\textit{Euclid} VIS images of lens systems hosting a fiducial $3\\times10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ subhalo and vary its properties to assess the robustness of mass inference. We find that \\textit{Euclid}'s angular resolution cannot break the intrinsic mass--concentration degeneracy of subhaloes, nor deblend the light of satellite galaxies (when present) associated with them, leading to biased inferred halo masses. These limitations are overcome with high-resolution follow-up imaging from facilities such as the \\textit{Hubble Space Telescope}, enabling accurate halo-mass measurements. We forecast that a statistical sample of $\\sim100$ such systems, combining lensing-derived halo masses with stellar masses from photometric SED fitting, can constrain the SHMR at dwarf-galaxy scales with a precision of $\\sim0.05$~dex in halo mass and $\\sim0.03$~dex in stellar mass, enabling powerful tests of galaxy formation theories.",

Hensley, Desika Narayanan, Julia Roman-Duval, Evan D. Skillman 19 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We explore the physical origins of the observed deficit of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at sub-solar metallicity using JWST/NIRCam imaging of the nearby galaxy M101, covering regions from solar metallicity (Z$_{\\odot}$) down to 0.4 Z$_{\\odot}$. These maps are used to trace the radial evolution of the shortest-wavelength PAH feature at 3.3 $\\mu$m, which is emitted preferentially by the smallest PAHs ($<100$ carbon atoms). The fractional contribution of PAH 3.3 $\\mu$m to the total PAH luminosity ($\\Sigma$PAH) increases by 3x as metallicity declines, rising from $\\sim$1$\\%$ to $\\sim$3$\\%$ over the observed range, consistent with prior predictions from the inhibited grain growth model based on Spitzer spectroscopy. We explore model refinements including photon effects and alternative size evolution prescriptions, and find that a modest amount of small grain photo-destruction remains possible, provided the grain size cutoff does not exceed $\\sim55$ carbon atoms. The best-fit models predict 3.3 $\\mu$m/$\\Sigma$PAH will rise to $\\sim5.6-7.7\\%$ at 10$\\%$ Z$_{\\odot}$. Surprisingly, even as $\\Sigma$PAH drops significantly relative to the total infrared luminosity (TIR) as metallicity declines, 3.3 $\\mu$m/TIR alone rises, potentially indicating the mass fraction of the smallest PAH grains increases as the total dust content in galaxies drops. The current model cannot fully reproduce this trend even if the unusually strong effects of changing radiation field hardness on 3.3 $\\mu$m/TIR are included. This may be evidence that the smallest PAHs are uniquely robust against destruction and inhibited growth effects. These results highlight the pivotal role that short-wavelength PAH emission can play in studies of low-metallicity and high-redshift galaxies.",

The simulations include detailed modeling of star formation, chemical enrichment, and supernova feedback using the CELib and Grackle libraries, achieving baryonic resolutions of $\\sim2\\times10^3\\,M_\\odot$. Our study focuses on how assembly history governs the structural and kinematic diversity of dwarf galaxies within the $\\Lambda$CDM framework. The simulated galaxies reproduce the observed stellar-to-halo mass, mass--metallicity, and size--mass relations for nearby dwarf galaxies, including those of the Local Group, yielding stellar masses of $\\sim10^7\\,M_\\odot$. The galaxies display a broad range of rotational support, where gas is generally more rotationally supported than stars. Differences in morphology and kinematics primarily reflect variations in halo assembly timescales and merger activity. Early-assembling, high-concentration halos form stars efficiently and become gas-poor by $z=0$, while late-assembling, low-concentration halos remain gas-rich due to delayed star formation and rejuvenated gas accretion. We find a trend between rotational support and the cumulative merger mass fraction, providing tentative evidence that dynamical heating induced by mergers plays a role in shaping the kinematic diversity. In some cases, late-time mergers induce the formation of extended gas disks by delivering fresh gas and angular momentum. These results demonstrate that it is assembly history, rather than halo mass alone, that shapes the present-day kinematic and morphological diversity of dwarf galaxies.",

Zaporozhchenko Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The dynamics of globular clusters in the Fornax dwarf galaxy poses a challenge for the standard cold dark matter and can be used to test other models of dark matter. We study this dynamics in the context of ultralight bosonic dark matter model, accounting for the damping term in a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Employing analytic formulas for the dynamical friction force, the infall time and evolution of globular clusters are compared in the cases with and without the damping term. It is argued that the damping term plays an important role for the Fornax timing problem in ultralight dark matter (ULDM) models. In particular, the infall time of globular cluster GC3 can attain the required value, provided that ULDM is non-interacting or has a very small repulsive self-interaction. In the strongly-interacting ULDM, there is no solution for the required infall time for GC3 if its starting position is $r_0\\lesssim 1.5$ kpc.",

Tissera, Emanuel Sillero, Jenny Gonzalez-Jara, Lucas Bignone, Ignacio Muñoz-Escobar, Susana Pedrosa, Rosa Domínguez-Tenreiro 15 pages, 10 figures, Published in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Supernova (SN) feedback-driven galactic outflows are a key physical process that contributes to the baryon cycle by regulating the star formation activity, reducing the amount of metals in low-mass galaxies and enriching the circumgalactic (CGM) and intergalactic media (IGM). We aim to understand the chemical loop of sub-Milky Way (MW) galaxies and their nearby regions. We studied 15 simulated central sub-MW galaxies (M* <= 10^10 Msun) and intermediate-mass galaxies (M* \\sim 10^10 Msun) from the CIELO-P7 high-resolution simulations. We followed the evolution of the progenitor galaxies, their properties and the characteristics of the outflows within the redshift range z = [0, 7]. We used two dynamically-motivated outflow definitions, unbound outflows and expelled mass rates, to quantify the impact of SN feedback. At z \\sim 0, sub-MW galaxies have a larger fraction of their current oxygen mass in the gas phase but have expelled a greater portion beyond the virial radius, compared to their higher-mass counterparts. Galaxies with M* <\\sim 10^9 Msun have 10-40 per cent of their total oxygen mass within R200 in the CGM, and an equivalent to 10-60 per cent expelled into the IGM. In contrast, more massive galaxies have most of the oxygen mass locked by the stellar populations. The CGM of low-mass galaxies predominantly contains oxygen low-temperature gas, acting as a metal reservoir. We find that the outflows are more oxygen-rich for sub-MW galaxies, Zout/ZISM \\sim 1.5, than for higher-mass galaxies, Zout/ZISM <= 0.5, particularly for z < 2. Mass-loading factors of eta_out \\sim 0 - 6 are detected in agreement with observations (abridged).",

Using wide-field imaging data from the DESI Legacy Survey combined with a color-magnitude matched-filter technique, we perform a systematic analysis of extra-tidal features in 28 Galactic globular clusters of likely extragalactic origin, representing the largest homogeneous sample examined in this context to date. The clusters display diverse morphologies: 12 exhibit tidal tails, 9 show diffuse envelopes, and 7 reveal no clear extra-tidal features. Notably, we report the first detection of an extended tidal structure around the Sagittarius-associated cluster Terzan 7. To explore the underlying drivers, we compare intrinsic properties, orbital dynamics, and possible accretion associations across morphological groups. From the parameter distributions, complemented by Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, we find that total mass, escape velocity, concentration, tidal filling factor, pericentric radius, eccentricity and radial angle in action-angle coordinates are all likely group-sensitive parameters. These results suggest that both internal cluster properties and orbital configurations play important roles in shaping extra-tidal morphologies. In addition, the cluster's accretion history shows no clear correlation with the presence of tidal features, indicating that it is not a direct driver of outer structure formation. Overall, the diversity of tidal structures is unlikely to be governed by a single factor, but instead reflects the interplay between internal dynamical evolution and the external Galactic environment. This study provides the most comprehensive constraints so far on the physical processes driving extra-tidal structures in accreted globular clusters.",

We update an analytical cusp-core transition model by incorporating the effect of supernova-driven mass loss. Adapting this model to SPARC galaxies, we measure the energy conversion efficiency epsilon, defined as the fraction of supernova feedback energy that is used to change the central dark-matter potential. We find epsilon ~ 0.01 for nearby SPARC galaxies. Building on these measurements, we compare the dynamical energy required for a cusp-core transformation with the feedback energy available over burst cycles and identify a cusp-core transition forbidden region on the halo-stellar mass plane where transformation cannot occur. Galaxies with halo masses from 10^8 to 10^11 M_sun lie outside the forbidden region, whereas ultra-faint dwarf galaxies < 10^8 M_sun, galaxy groups and clusters > 10^11 M_sun fall within it, consistent with their high central densities and the inefficiency of core formation at very low and very high masses. This approach also explains the observed diversity of inner density profiles in low-mass systems, showing that both the star formation rate and the energy conversion efficiency govern them, with the latter emerging as a key parameter setting the strength of the cusp-core transition. Beyond the cusp-core problem, our observationally inferred energy conversion efficiency provides a model independent benchmark that strongly constrains galaxy formation models.",

Accepted by A&A, Final version with language corrections Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The C-MetaLL project has provided homogeneous spectroscopic abundances of 290 Classical Cepheids (DCEPs) for which we have the intensity-averaged magnitudes in multiple optical and near-infrared (NIR) bands, periods, pulsation modes, and Gaia parallaxes. Our goal is to derive updated period-Wesenheit-metallicity (PWZ) relations using the largest and most homogeneous metallicity sample ever used for such analyses, covering a range of $-1.3<$[Fe/H]$<+0.3$ dex. We computed several optical and NIR Wesenheit magnitudes using 275 DCEPs with reliable parallaxes, by applying a robust photometric parallax technique, which simultaneously fits all parameters -- including the global Gaia parallax counter-correction -- and handles outliers without data rejection. We find a stronger metallicity dependence ($\\gamma \\approx -0.5$ mag/dex in optical, $-0.4$ mag/dex in NIR) than recent literature reports. Gaia parallax zero-point conter-corrections ($\\epsilon$) vary smoothly across bands, with an average value of $\\sim$10 $\\mu$as, aligning with previous determinations. Applying our PWZ relations to LMC Cepheids yields distances generally consistent within $1\\sigma$ with geometric estimates. The choice of reddening law has a negligible impact, while using only fundamental-mode pulsators significantly increases the uncertainties. Including $\\alpha$-element corrections increases $|\\gamma|$ and reduces $\\epsilon$. However, we find statistically consistent $\\gamma$ values with the literature, particularly for the key Wesenheit magnitude in the HST bands, by restricting the sample to the brighter (i.e. closer) objects, or by including only pulsators with $-0.7<$[Fe/H]$<$0.2 dex. Our results hint at a large $\\gamma$ or a non-linear dependence on metallicity of DCEP luminosities at the metal-poor end, which is difficult to quantify with the precision of parallaxes of the present dataset.",

Published in ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Binaries that host a carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WC) star and an OB-type companion can be copious dust producers. Yet the properties of dust, particularly the grain size distribution, in these systems remain uncertain. We present Band 6 observations of WR 112 by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array telescope (ALMA), which are the first millimeter observations of a WC binary system capable of resolving its dust emission. By combining ALMA observations with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) images, we were able to analyze the spatially resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) of WR 112. We found that the SEDs are consistent with emissions from hydrogen-poor amorphous carbon grains. Notably, our results also suggest that the majority of grains in the system have radii below one micrometer, and the extended dust structures are dominated by nanometer-sized grains. Among four parameterizations of the grain radius distribution that we tested, a bimodal distribution, with abundant nanometer-sized grains and a secondary population of 0.1-micron grains, best reproduces the observed SED. This bimodal distribution helps to reconcile the previously conflicting grain size estimates reported for WR 112 and for other WC systems. We hypothesize that dust destruction mechanisms such as radiative torque disruption and radiative-driven sublimation are responsible for driving the system to the bimodal grain size distribution.",

Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present independent polarimetric observations of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, including the first near-infrared polarimetric measurements. Using imaging polarimeters, we measured the degree of linear polarization from the visible RC band (0.64 {\\mu}m) to the near-infrared KS band (2.25 {\\mu}m), and investigated its dependence on solar phase angle (polarization phase curve; PPC) and wavelength (polarization color curve; PCC). We confirm that the PPC of 3I/ATLAS differs significantly from those of typical Solar System comets, showing an unusually large polarization amplitude. This PPC shows no significant change in the RC band across perihelion passage, despite the perihelion lying within the water snow line. This indicates that the unusual polarimetric behavior of 3I/ATLAS is unlikely to be driven by transient volatile activity, but instead reflects intrinsic optical properties of refractory dust particles. The PCC increases with wavelength over 0.6-1.2 {\\mu}m and peaks at 1.5-2.0 {\\mu}m, suggesting that the dominant scattering units are dust aggregates composed of submicron-sized monomers, broadly consistent with interstellar dust and solar-system cometary aggregates. Taken together, our results indicate that 3I/ATLAS preserves polarimetric properties characteristic of a primitive cometary planetesimal formed in another planetary system, with a refractory dust composition that differs from that typically observed among Solar System comets, despite sharing a similar size scale of the aggregate building blocks.",

Solid methane (CH$_4$) is an important molecule in interstellar and planetary environments, serving as a precursor to complex organic compounds, and it is a potential biosignature in exoplanetary studies. Despite its significance, laboratory data on the low temperature phase of methane below 10 K remain limited. Aims. We obtained spectra of methane in binary mixtures at 10 K and compared them to the spectra obtained at 6.7 K. These temperatures correspond to phases II and II* of pure methane and are representative of dark molecular clouds and protostars in early stages. We also tested whether the data we obtained can be applied to interpret JWST data. Methods. Laboratory reference spectra were obtained with the ISEAge setup via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in transmission mode. A weighted $\\chi^2$ minimization was used for the fitting. Results. We present infrared spectra with corresponding band strengths of pure methane and binary mixtures with methane: CH$_4$:H$_2$O, CH$_4$:CO$_2$, CH$_4$:CH$_3$OH, and CH$_4$:NH$_3$ at 6.7 K and 10 K. They show an increase of 20% in mixtures compared to the commonly used 10 K band strength value of pure methane. We also tested whether the spectra can be used on open JWST data by probing the spatial distribution of methane in B335. We also present additional experiments concerning the phase transition of methane between phase II* and phase II. Conclusions. Our results reveal distinct spectral features for methane in non-H$_2$O environments that enable a more accurate interpretation of JWST observations. The dataset of spectra is publicly available on Zenodo and can be used for fitting JWST data.",

Fixed the abstract phrasing in v2 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present the Montreal Open Clusters and Associations database (MOCAdb), a public MySQL database with a Python interface. MOCAdb provides a census of memberships for 10259 associations and open clusters, with a comprehensive compilation of literature measurements such as spectral types, kinematics, rotation periods, activity indices, spectral indices, and photometry. All known substellar objects are cataloged in MOCAdb, along with 2943 public spectra, to enable the characterization of substellar association members. MOCAdb also features periodically updated calculations such as Galactic UVW space velocities. We use this compilation to construct mappings between independent association definitions, and to update the BANYAN $\\Sigma$ membership classification tool, which now includes 8125 associations. The BANYAN $\\Sigma$ model construction is improved to account for heterogeneous and correlated errors and to capture complex association shapes using Gaussian mixture models. Combined with Gaia DR3, this enabled us to identify 11535 yet unrecognized candidate members of young associations within 500 pc, mostly M dwarfs. Our results corroborate a recent observation that systematics up to $\\approx$4 km/s remain in Gaia DR3 radial velocities for A-type stars. We present an updated census of age-calibrated exoplanets and substellar objects: 134 age-calibrated exoplanet systems (plus 121 TESS exoplanet candidates), 99 of which did not appear to have known memberships so far, and 455 substellar (L0 or later) candidate members of young associations, 196 of which appear newly recognized. We bring the total of candidate isolated planetary-mass objects to 101, 53 of which are newly recognized candidate members.",

Talafha Accepted for publication in Jordan Journal of Physics (JJP) Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The elemental abundances of neon isotopes provide valuable insights into stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis. In this study, we calculate the abundances of the isotopes 18Ne, 19Ne, 20Ne, 21Ne, and 22Ne across the five principal evolutionary phases of the Sun: hydrogen burning, lively old age, onset of rapid growth and red giant, helium burning and helium exhaustion. The calculations were carried out using the open-source nucnet-tools package, developed by the Webnucleo Group at Clemson University. Initial isotope abundances were adopted from standard proto-solar compositions. Their evolution was computed under static hydrostatic burning conditions, assuming constant temperature and density within each phase. The results show that the stable isotopes 20Ne and 22Ne remain dominant throughout the Sun's lifetime, whereas the short-lived isotopes 18Ne and 19Ne decay rapidly during or shortly after the hydrogen-burning phase. The predictions obtained for the helium burning and exhaustion phases provide quantitative neon-isotope abundances that are not extensively reported in the existing literature. These results offer valuable reference values for future studies of solar and stellar evolution, nucleosynthetic pathways, and isotopic modeling.",

The outburst coincides with the secondary minima of the system. Approximately 12 similar brightening events have been reported between 1890 and 2020, with only the 1993 outburst being studied spectroscopically. In our study, we monitored the system from 2021 to 2023, covering $\\sim$1.5 orbital cycles, providing an opportunity to understand the spectral evolution of the outburst over a complete orbital period of YY Her. We found that the temperature and luminosity estimations based on emission line fluxes exhibit orbital phase dependence. The values estimated at phase 0.5, corresponding to the secondary minimum, were the most reliable. The temperature of the hot component is $\\approx 1.41 \\times 10^5 \\, \\text{K}$, and the luminosity is $\\approx 1020 \\, L_{\\odot}$ during the outburst, reduced to $\\approx 1.3 \\times 10^5 \\, \\text{K}$ and $\\approx 830 \\, L_{\\odot}$ after one orbital cycle at phase 0.5. Temperature estimations during the outbursts suggest that YY Her exhibits both hot-type (2021) and cool-type (1993) behavior, similar to another symbiotic star, AG Dra.

Valori Accepted by Astronomy & Astrophysics. 13 pages. 13 figures Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) At low coronal temperatures around or below 1 MK distinct areas in the surroundings of active regions (AR) show emission at a level significantly below the emission coming from the quiet Sun (QS). These areas are referred to as dark halos, dark canopies, or dark moats. To better understand the nature of dark halos we study the connection between the photospheric magnetic field and coronal emission at different temperatures. Combining Solar Orbiter data from the high-resolution Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (SO/PHI) and Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instruments allows us to identify these areas that are dark in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) in the immediate vicinity of an AR. We probe both the photospheric magnetic field as well as the coronal intensities as a function of distance to the AR NOAA 12893. The dark halo has an unsigned magnetic flux density similar to the QS, but shows a strong radial dependence with distance from the AR centre. It drops by 38 % from 6.1 G at the inner boundary to 3.8 G at the outer, shifting from above to below QS levels. Coronal emission $\\leq$1 MK is $\\sim$40 % below QS and shows no dependence on distance to the AR centre. In contrast, at $\\geq$1.6 MK, emission exceeds QS levels, but declines outward toward QS values. A few hot loops extend from the AR periphery across the halo, while at lower temperatures no such loops appear and short loops dominate the corona. The reduced unsigned magnetic flux density in the outermost parts of the dark halo, below QS level, suggests that reduced coronal heating due to weak underlying magnetic flux heating could be partially responsible for the reduced emission around 1 MK. Closer to the AR, other mechanisms might lead to reduced heating. The different loops structures detected for hotter and cooler coronal temperatures likely play a crucial role in understanding coronal dark halos.",

Similar acceleration for particles trapped on closed loops energizes solar flares. In contrast, fast, wide, CME-driven shocks accelerate seed ions from the ambient corona that grow resonant Alfven waves as they stream outward. These waves can scatter and trap lower-rigidity ions near the shock, limiting outflow, and flattening low-energy spectra upstream at the \"streaming limit.\" Downstream, a spatially-uniform \"reservoir\" of SEPs is shed by the expanding shock between it and the Sun. These trapped invariant SEP spectra decrease in intensity adiabatically as the volume of the reservoir expands. Ions from the reservoir can seed further acceleration in multi-shock event and energetic proton precipitation can prolong solar gamma-ray emission. Shocks are often additionally seeded by residual impulsive ions which dominate the SEP heavy-ion abundances with their signature enhancements. As samples of the corona, SEP abundances also probe differences with the photosphere that depend upon the first ionization potential (FIP) of the elements.",

      "abstract": "William A. Gardner, Antonio Napolitano Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) It has recently been discovered that the time phases (time-varying delays) of the irregular periodicities observed in the Sunspot series, consisting of the approximate 27-day latitude-averaged plasma rotation and approximate 11-yr magnetic pole reversal, share a common pattern or cycle of irregularity. Because the method of measurement contains an unknown constant delay of no practical significance, the average of the measured cycle of delay is subtracted out, and the resultant cycle proceeds from zero delay to maximum delay, back to zero delay, then to maximum advance, and finally back to zero advance/delay. The period of this cycle is estimated to be 164 years, which does not allow for even one full repetition of the pattern in the 205-yr data record. So, it may or may not be a segment of an ongoing (pseudo) periodicity. Nevertheless, the fact that this cycle of irregularity in period is shared by two long-recognized genuine irregular periodicities tied to specific activity from two distinct solar phenomena suggests there is a common phenomenon affecting these periodicities. The physics-based link between the rotation speed of the interior of the Sun and the average over latitude of the rotation period of the surface plasma, approximately 27 days on average, suggests the possibility that there may be a single primary phenomenon that is responsible for irregularity of both rotation of the interior of the Sun and the period, approximately 11 yrs on average, of pole-reversal. This is consistent with recently reported (November 2025) results on hypothesized planetary forcing of the Solar dynamo.",

However, due to observational limitations, observations of {plasma sheet} tearing and the resulting plasmoids are rather scarce. This scarcity significantly hinders our understanding of the role of plasmoids in the reconnection process from an observational perspective. Using high-spatiotemporal multiwavelength observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we traced the entire evolution of a coronal {plasma sheet}. Its formation was driven by the emergence of photospheric magnetic flux, followed by tearing, and eventual decay. The evolution of the {plasma sheet} exhibited two distinct stages. Initially, it rose rapidly, lengthened, and underwent tearing at a low frequency. Subsequently, its ascent slowed, it began to shorten, and the tearing occurred more frequently. Detailed analysis of the reconnecting {plasma sheet} focuses on heating, plasmoid dynamics (formation and ejection), and the resulting reconnection rate change. Two key heating processes are identified: {plasma sheet} tearing and coalescence involving plasmoids and magnetic cusps. More importantly, combining observations with analytical studies suggests that plasmoids are key carriers of magnetic flux fast transferring in the observed torn {plasma sheet}, and their formation and ejection significantly enhance the reconnection rate and facilitate the onset of fast reconnection.",

Within a simple analytical framework, we derive testable relations linking the long-to-orbital period ratio to the binary mass ratio, the normalized disk size, and the disk tilt angle $\\beta$, which itself can be inferred from the long-cycle amplitude, orbital inclination $i$, and disk luminosity fraction. The model naturally reproduces the two observed long-cycle light-curve morphologies -- sinusoidal and double-hump -- distinguished by the geometric criterion $i+\\beta \\le 90^\\circ$ versus $i+\\beta>90^\\circ$. Applying these relations to a sample of DPVs, we find that the inferred disk sizes are physically reasonable and consistent with independent light-curve modeling for a non-negligible subset of systems. Our results show that tidal nodal precession represents a viable and potentially important contributor to the long-period variability of DPVs and provide a quantitative framework for future observational and theoretical studies.",

Conventional loop modelings typically assume a uniform loop cross section. With a variation of the cross section taken into account, in this work we carry out both analytical and numerical modelings of the radiative cooling in a solar flare loop. It is found that a cross-sectional expansion with height can efficiently suppress the draining of loop material from the corona while not significantly affecting the decrease of loop temperature. Reflected to the loop energetics, the coronal part of the loop cools more dominantly by radiation, and more importantly, the loop radiative outputs are shifted toward lower temperatures. These findings pose important physical implications for extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) late-phase emissions discovered in some solar flares. The late-phase loops in these flares are believed to bear a more notable cross-sectional expansion owing to their longer lengths. Compared with the main-phase loops, the late-phase loops would emit more effectively at middle temperatures, which could, to a certain degree, mitigate the severe heating requirement for the production of a prominent warm coronal late-phase peak. In addition, the cross-sectional expansion also affects the shape of the emission lights curves, causing a sharper decay after the emission peak. Such an emission pattern has been validated with the observations of an EUV late-phase flare, and could serve as a potential diagnostic tool to judge the degree of loop cross-sectional expansion in an extended flare dataset.",

Simões The Astrophysical Journal, 999:27, 2026 March 1 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We investigate how the magnetic loop length of solar flares relates to the timing between their thermal and nonthermal emission signatures. Our study analyzes a sample of 96 C-, M-, and X-class flares observed between 2013 and 2015 with soft X-rays, hard X-rays, and extreme UV. For each event, we determine the time delay {\\Delta}t between the hard X-ray and soft X-ray peak, and estimate the flare loop length L from UV footpoints assuming a semicircular geometry. In every case, longer flare loops are consistently associated with larger timing delays. Across the full sample, we find a strong correlation, R = 0.88 between L and {\\Delta}t. We also quantify how closely each flare follows the Neupert effect using a coefficient RN, defined as the Pearson correlation between the time derivative of the soft X-ray flux and the hard X-ray light curve. Applying correlation thresholds of RN > 0.5 and RN > 0.8 yields subsets of 87 and 46 events, respectively. In both cases, the linear relationship between loop length and peak delay remains clearly expressed. For the RN > 0.5 subset, the correlation is R = 0.87, while the more selective subset with RN > 0.8 displays an even stronger correlation of R = 0.91. These results show that the overall trend persists across increasingly stringent correlation thresholds. The results provide direct observational confirmation that magnetic loop geometry plays a key role in governing the temporal evolution of energy transport in solar flares.",

The same puzzle exists for the stellar coronae heating as well. In this study, we present a series of findings on solar spicules and their subsequent impact on the corona within a coronal hole environment, characterized by locally open magnetic field lines, combining insights from MHD simulations with observations. We find that the convective and turbulent motions around the solar surface cause plenty of shocks and small-scale magnetic reconnection in the lower atmosphere. The combined effects of shock compression and reconnection outflows then drive the formation of groups of spicules with a quasi-period of about $300$\\,s and width of $\\sim 200-500$\\,km. The spicule upflows provide an averaged mass flux above $10^{-9}$\\,kg\\,m$^{-2}$\\,s$^{-1}$ in the lower corona to sustain the solar wind in coronal holes, and they continuously trigger further new local slow-mode waves and shocks. These waves supply an energy flux of $10-100$\\,W\\,m$^{-2}$ in the lower corona, and they are dissipated by heat conduction and compression heating to sustain the corona temperature of about $1$\\,MK. The results also indicate that the upward propagating disturbances (PDs) observed in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) passbands are caused by both spicule upflows and slow-mode waves and shocks. Our findings help to understand the long standing problem of coronal heating and the origin of solar winds in coronal hole regions.",

Faherty, Johanna M. Vos Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Brown dwarfs and exoplanets are thought to host complex atmospheric phenomena such as clouds, storms, and chemical heterogeneity, akin to weather patterns on Earth. These features can produce pronounced spectral variability. Time-variability monitoring provides a unique window into surface inhomogeneities that cannot be directly resolved with foreseeable imaging technology. Current time-series analysis techniques have provided qualitative constraints on variability mechanisms but lack the ability to quantitatively estimate the extent of variation on atmospheric properties. We present Tempawral, the first data-driven time-resolved atmospheric retrieval framework that quantitatively retrieving variability in atmospheric parameters via an eigen-spectra inversion technique, leveraging the full spectra dataset. We validate this method on simulated time-series spectra of a variable brown dwarf, demonstrating that it successfully recovers key variability drivers, including inhomogeneous cloud coverage, evolving chemical abundances, and changes in temperature structure. We further showcase the utility of Tempawral by applying it to JWST/NIRISS-SOSS time-series observations of a highly variable T2.5 brown dwarf. The observed variability is best explained by a $\\sim$300 K temperature perturbation near the 1-bar, accompanied by variations in the abundances of $\\rm H_{2}O$, $\\rm CO$, $\\rm FeH$, as well as changes in the thickness of the iron cloud deck. This work provides a generalized framework for time-resolved atmospheric retrievals in the JWST era, enabling comprehensive interpretations of dynamic atmospheric processes in substellar objects.",

Lee 18 pages - submitted to The Open Journal of Astrophysics Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Contemporary exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheric research relies heavily on retrieval frameworks to recover thermal and chemical properties and perform model comparison in an observational data-driven approach. However, the computational effort required for retrieval modelling has rapidly increased, driven by JWST data that covers large spectral intervals at moderate spectral resolutions, and ground-based, high-resolution spectroscopy. To help tackle the computational burden faced by contemporary retrieval requirements, I present a new sub-stellar atmosphere retrieval modelling framework, Exo Skryer, that utilises the JAX library for Python to enable scalable, computationally efficient forward modelling as well as posterior sampling. I present example retrievals for pre- and current JWST era observations for both transmission and emission spectra, finding consistent results to previous retrieval modelling efforts, apart from a WASP-107b test case. In addition, I present a new method to directly retrieve the real and imaginary optical constants (n, k) of suspected aerosol infrared absorption features. Due to its computational expediency, Exo Skryer will be highly suited for future demanding retrieval efforts that incorporate more spatial dimensionality, complex forward models and high-dimensional parameter sets.",

Post-Main-Sequence Expansion Mechanism Po-Sheng Ou, Ke-Jung Chen 17 pages, 16 figures, submitted to A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) In this series of papers, we address the long-standing question of why post-main-sequence stars expand into red giants (RGs) or red supergiants (RSGs). This paper aims to identify the key physical mechanism that drives stellar evolution toward the RG/RSG phase. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), we perform controlled numerical experiments by systematically varying stellar parameters in evolutionary models, and compare those that successfully evolve into RG/RSGs and those that do not. We show that envelope expansion toward the RG/RSG phase cannot be explained by energy absorption. Instead, it is governed by a refined form of the \"mirror principle,\" in which the stellar envelope responds oppositely to its inner boundary, defined by the outer edge of the hydrogen-burning shell, rather than directly to the helium core. This behavior arises naturally from hydrostatic equilibrium, as the burning shell establishes a moving, nearly constant-pressure inner boundary for the envelope. We identify two evolutionary pathways toward the RG/RSG phase that both follow this refined mirror principle: (1) direct envelope expansion during helium-core contraction, and (2) continued expansion after contraction ceases, driven by a decline in nuclear energy generation rate. The final approach to the RG/RSG phase is marked by a structural transition in the envelope, characterized by mass redistribution and the development of an extended convective region. We present a unified physical framework for envelope expansion toward the RG/RSG phase, based on the refined mirror principle and the final structural transition, and outline an evolutionary roadmap leading to the RG/RSG phase.",

Steady-State Envelope Solutions Po-Sheng Ou, Ke-Jung Chen 10 pages, 9 figures, submitted to A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The physical origin of red giants (RGs) and red supergiants (RSGs) remains a fundamental question in stellar astrophysics. In Paper II of this series, we investigate the physical mechanisms governing envelope expansion toward the RG/RSG phase by systematically exploring the physically realizable configurations of stellar envelopes. We construct steady-state stellar envelope models by solving the time-independent stellar structure equations while neglecting the core. The inner boundary is defined by a fixed pressure condition motivated by MESA stellar evolution models presented in Paper I. Our models show three key features of envelope expansion toward the RG/RSG phase. (1) The refined mirror principle identified in Paper I is recovered: the post-main-sequence stellar radius varies inversely with the radius of the envelope's inner boundary, arising purely from hydrostatic equilibrium. (2) We identify an upper limit to envelope expansion corresponding to an effective temperature of $\\sim 4000,{\\rm K}$, characteristic of RG/RSG stars and consistent with the Hayashi limit. This temperature limit is regulated by H$^{-}$ opacity, whose sharp decline at low temperatures flattens the surface temperature gradient and drives a structural transition. (3) The yellow regime of intermediate radius corresponds to an instability zone, in which small displacements of the hydrogen-burning shell produce large variations in stellar radius, naturally accounting for the bifurcation of giants and supergiants into blue and red branches instead of remaining in the yellow regime.",

Talafha, Bhargav Vaidya Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Machine Learning (cs.LG) The solar dynamo relies on the regeneration of the poloidal magnetic field through processes strongly modulated by nonlinear feedbacks such as tilt quenching (TQ) and latitude quenching (LQ). These mechanisms play a decisive role in regulating the buildup of the Sun's polar field and, in turn, the amplitude of future solar cycles. In this work, we employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) to solve the surface flux transport (SFT) equation, embedding physical constraints directly into the neural network framework. By systematically varying transport parameters, we isolate the relative contributions of TQ and LQ to polar dipole buildup. We use the residual dipole moment as a diagnostic for cycle-to-cycle amplification and show that TQ suppression strengthens with increasing diffusivity, while LQ dominates in advection-dominated regimes. The ratio $\\Delta D_{\\mathrm{LQ}}/\\Delta D_{\\mathrm{TQ}}$ exhibits a smooth inverse-square dependence on the dynamo effectivity range, refining previous empirical fits with improved accuracy and reduced scatter. The results further reveal that the need for a decay term is not essential for PINN set-up due to the training process. Compared with the traditional 1D SFT model, the PINN framework achieves significantly lower error metrics and more robust recovery of nonlinear trends. Our results suggest that the nonlinear interplay between LQ and TQ can naturally produce alternations between weak and strong cycles, providing a physical explanation for the observed even-odd cycle modulation. These findings demonstrate the potential of PINN as an accurate, efficient, and physically consistent tool for solar cycle prediction.",

The solar wind velocity (200 kilometers per second) and ion temperature (25 electron Volts) were significantly reduced as compared to their values in the ambient solar wind. Because the polarity of the radial magnetic field did not change sign on the two sides of the crossing and the crossed region contained a double-peaked plasma structure, the spacecraft must have passed near the base of a pseudo-streamer. In the plasma frame, an electric field as large as 400 millivolts per meter was detected during the crossing. This field is not associated with an ExB drift because it is observed in the plasma rest frame. Instead, it is balanced by the Generalized Ohm's Law terms whose current dependent term associated with this electric field was less than 1 milliampere per square meter, corresponding to a drift velocity less than 2.5 kilometers per second. The region also contained a turbulent plasma with density fluctuations as large as 0.3, suggesting that the resistive term in the Generalized Ohm's Law could be significant. In addition, both the density and electric field had non-zero slopes as functions of time, suggesting that the pressure gradient term in the Generalized Ohm's Law also mattered. This large electric field in the plasma rest frame may be the first and largest such field ever reported.",

Grogin Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Using repeat imaging of a galaxy cluster taken over a seventeen-year baseline, we examine the impact that degraded Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE) has on photometric measurements of extended sources using the ACS/WFC on HST. We examine how measured brightnesses depend on time since ACS installation, source location on the WFC detectors, source brightness, and local background level in individual exposures. We find that global brightness measurements using large apertures are generally reliable within $\\sim$0.05 magnitudes across the WFC detectors if exposure backgrounds are above $20e^-/{pixel}$ and sources are brighter than $\\sim300e^-$ in a single exposure. However, brightness measurements on smaller scales can suffer deficiencies in excess of 0.1 mags (sometimes, significantly more) in recent data unless sources are very close to the CCD serial registers ($\\lesssim 512$ pixels), or brighter than $\\sim3000\\,e^-$ in a single exposure. We also show how degraded CTE can result in artificial asymmetries in galaxy light distributions, which are largely mitigated if backgrounds are $>20e^-/{pixel}$ and targets are not far ($>1536$ pixels) from the serial registers. As expected, brightness measurements in later epoch data are best when using CTE-corrected images (FLC/DRC), but our results imply that the pixel-based CTE correction algorithm employed by the ACS reduction pipeline does not necessarily place charge back into its original location within extended sources. Based on this study, users are advised to keep backgrounds above the already recommended $30e^-/\\mathrm{pixel}$, ensure targets will have at least $\\sim 300e^-$ in a single exposure, and place targets close to the serial registers if analysis of their spatially resolved properties is needed.",

The WVR is intended to decrease calibration overheads for tropospheric phase correction for the high frequency bands (5 \\& 6; 30.5-116 GHz) to levels lower than feasible with fast switched reference gain calibration. In this memo, we present an alternative concept utilizing the standard Band-4 science receivers and the main antennas. This would require the Band-4 feed to be placed between those of Bands 5 \\& 6 resulting in a beam offset of 0.8 deg, similar to the beam size of the standalone 1.5 m antenna. The main benefits of the Band-4 WVR concept are: (1) sensing water vapor in a region more representative of the Band 5 \\& 6 science beams in the lower layers of the troposphere, in the near-field of the 18 m antenna, than the 1.5 m antenna (2) significantly relaxing the stability requirements due to the lower receiver temperature of the standard Band-4 cryogenic receiver and (3) eliminating the procurement, deployment, and maintenance of a large number of standalone units. Given these advantages, it is recommended that the details and the pros and cons of Band-4 WVR implementation compared a standalone system be carefully considered.",

Zhang 14 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in A&A Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Previous studies based on the latest realisation of the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF3) have suggested a correlation between astrometric properties (such as the radio-optical offset) and redshift for active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We extend these investigations by using a large, all-sky sample of approximately 22,000 compact radio sources from the Radio Fundamental catalogue (RFC) to examine this relationship in a systematic and statistically robust manner. We compiled redshifts for about 10,000 RFC sources over the range 0 < z < 5 by combining data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17/19 with additional datasets from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database. Cross-matching with Gaia Data Release 3 yielded a clean sample of 4,068 RFC objects with reliable spectroscopic redshifts and classifications (galaxies and quasi-stellar objects; QSOs). We analysed the redshift dependence of their radio astrometric properties from very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) and their optical astrometric properties from Gaia. We find that the VLBI astrometric properties show no significant dependence on redshift within the achieved level of precision. In contrast, several optical astrometric quantities exhibit clear redshift-dependent behaviour. The median absolute radio-optical offsets decrease markedly over 0 < z < 0.5, where galaxies dominate the sample, decline more gradually over 0.5 < z < 1.3, and exhibit a mild increase at z > 1.3, where QSOs dominate. Similar behaviour is observed for several Gaia astrometric quantities, including astrometric uncertainties, proper motions, and G magnitudes. These behaviours can be largely explained by the dependence of Gaia astrometric performance on G magnitude and by the evolution of the G magnitude with redshift.",

      "abstract": "Safety Acquisitions: Redundancy for non-repeatable multi-orbit STIS visits Matthew M. Dallas, Matthew R. Siebert Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) For observations of supernovae, kilonovae, tidal disruption events, and other non-repeatable observations, it is important the science data is taken successfully within a specific time window. Part of obtaining that data is often centering objects in the aperture to a higher accuracy than is available from Hubble Space Telescope's (HST's) blind pointing. On HST STIS the sequence of exposures responsible for this centering is the target acquisition or STIS ACQ sequence, and it is most often placed only at the beginning of a visit. Unfortunately, STIS ACQ sequences will fail if the observatory experiences issues locating guide stars in time for the start of the required exposures. If the guide stars are located at a later point in the visit, the remaining science exposures can be taken but the pointing might not be as accurate as is required. This work discusses both the frequency of this issue and the feasibility of placing redundant or \"safety\" STIS ACQ sequences in a multi-orbit visit to regain the desired pointing accuracy in an affected visit. To do so we select a subset of all 113 STIS ACQ sequences from September 2018 to September 2023 which have experienced this issue. We find that this problem occurs in ~5% of the total STIS ACQ sequences taken during that time period, with a recent increase in the rate to ~9% from March to September 2023. Since the observatory goes through periods of better or worse pointing performance, this recent increased failure rate is not guaranteed to continue. For those failed visits which span multiple orbits, ~39% never obtain a lock on the guide stars and thus take no data. Of the multi-orbit visits that do recover the guide stars, the majority (~78%) do so before the beginning of science exposures in the second orbit. We also provide advice for users on how to make a risk assessment based on the analysis presented here.",

Accurate measurements remain challenging due to the large required dynamic range of up to 10 stellar magnitudes driving up operational complexity and cost. We developed an all-sky camera system operating at up to 500 frames per second featuring a novel Detection Localised Auto-brightness Control. Custom software manages high data throughput via transient detection and region-of-interest saving with real-time photometry. Two field deployments validate photometric accuracy against conventional 30 frames per second cameras and demonstrate the successful capture of a bright magnitude -15 fireball with minimal saturation. The system achieves an effective dynamic range between apparent magnitudes -3 and -17 capturing minimally saturated light curves for most fireballs. A successful semi-empirical fragmentation analysis verifies its ability to provide data for detailed physical modelling. The primary application for this validated system will be as a core component of the Global Fireball Observatory's next-generation instrumentation. The intention is to deploy it in a hybrid observatory, operating alongside a dedicated high-resolution astrometric camera. This configuration will allow the network to simultaneously capture precise trajectory data for orbit and fall-line calculations and acquire complete, unsaturated high dynamic range light curves at high temporal resolution for detailed physical analysis, combining the strengths of both systems.",

Lopez, Gennady Fiksel Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE) This paper provides experimental and numerical evidence supporting the occurrence of liposome congregation at the floors of meteor craters on Early Earth. This work builds on our earlier research, which demonstrated that liposomes submerged in a shallow Archean pond are protected from harmful UV radiation. This protection allows them to survive long enough for autocatalytic replication of amphiphiles and for mutation and selection of assemblies that maximize membrane stability. For liposomes to fuse, grow, exchange contents and membranes, and divide, they need to establish a population, which means forming a dense conglomerate that enables close physical contact. The study demonstrates that such a congregation is feasible in bowl-shaped meteor craters on Early Earth, especially under periodic seismic disturbances.",

Cherenkov light is prompt and therefore ideal for reaching the intrinsic timing limits of TOF systems. By utilizing a thin, high-refractive-index radiator a nearly instantaneous signal is generated by particles exceeding the Cherenkov threshold. In order to achieve the ultimate time resolution, we carried out a rigorous optimization of the radiator material and geometry, alongside the efficiency of the optical coupling to the SiPM sensors. The key factors limiting the time resolution were characterized by comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations, subsequently validated against experimental beam test data. We assembled small-scale prototypes instrumented with various Hamamatsu SiPM arrays sensors with pitches ranging from 1.3 to 3 mm coupled with various window materials, such as fused silica and MgF2, featuring various thickness values. The prototypes were successfully tested in beam test campaigns at the CERN-PS T10 beam line. The data were collected with a complete chain of front-end and readout electronics based on either the Petiroc 2A or the Radioroc 2 interfaced to a picoTDC to measure charges and times. By comparing the time measurements with two SiPM arrays we were able to measure a time resolution better than 33.2 ps at the full system level with a charged particle detection efficiency of 100%. Our results demonstrate the expected performance benchmarks for the charged particle detection efficiency and time resolution and highlight the potential of the developed Cherenkov-based TOF detectors for next-generation particle identification systems.",

The first VMEC implementation was written by Steven P. Hirshman and colleagues in the 1980s and 1990s and its latest Fortran incarnation (PARVMEC, this https URL) is widely used in stellarator optimization systems. Our work improves on previous implementations with regard to various critical aspects: special care has been put in providing an idiomatic Python experience, from installation to actual usage; VMEC++ has a zero-crash policy; it supports inputs in the classic INDATA format as well as friendlier JSON files. VMEC++ execution times are typically less than or equal to previous implementations, and time to convergence can be decreased dramatically by leveraging its hot-restart feature: by providing the output of a VMEC++ run as initial state for a subsequent one, VMEC++ is initialized using the previously converged equilibrium. This can dramatically decrease runtimes when running on many similar magnetic configurations as it typically happens in stellarator optimization pipelines. On the flip side, some features of the original Fortran VMEC implementation are not yet available in VMEC++, such as support for non-stellarator-symmetric configurations.

Contradictory answers appear in the literature. We show that such a disk can be eccentric, but only if it has a sharply truncated edge: the surface density $\\Sigma$ must vanish at the edge, and the $\\Sigma$ profile must be sufficiently steep at the point where it vanishes. If either requirement is violated, an eccentric disturbance leaks out of the bulk of the disk into the low density edge region, and cannot return. An edge where $\\Sigma$ asymptotes to zero but never vanishes, as is often assumed for astrophysical disks, is insufficiently sharp. Similar results were shown by Hunter & Toomre (1969) for galactic warps. We demonstrate these results in three ways: by solving the eigenvalue equation for the eccentricity profile; by solving the initial value problem; and by analyzing a new and simple dispersion relation that is valid for any wavenumber, unlike WKB. As a byproduct, we show that softening the self-gravitational potential is not needed to model a flat disk, and we develop a softening-free algorithm to model the disk's Laplace-Lagrange-like equations. The algorithm is easy to implement and is more accurate than softening-based methods at a given resolution by many orders of magnitude.",

The primary objective was to evaluate the performance of MPPCs (Silicon Photomultipliers) as robust, low-voltage alternatives to traditional photomultiplier tubes for detecting faint scintillation light. The optoelectronic properties of the sensors were analyzed, including single-photoelectron gain calibration and dark count rate measurements, to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. By embedding wavelength-shifting fibers to enhance light collection efficiency, the system was configured into a three-fold coincidence telescope. The angular distribution of the cosmic ray muon flux was measured to validate the detector's stability and geometric acceptance. Fitting the experimental data to a $\\bm{\\cos^n(\\theta)}$ distribution yielded an angular exponent of $\\bm{n = 1.44 \\pm 0.06}$, consistent with literature values.

AGPLv3 License Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Biomolecules (q-bio.BM) Amino acids (AAs) are a key target in the search for life beyond Earth due to their extensive role in the machinery of all known life, persistence over geologic timescales, and analytical detectability. However, AAs can also arise from abiotic processes on planets and in space. For example, material from asteroid Bennu contained 33 AAs, including 15 of the 20 proteinogenic AAs that are fundamental to life's functions. Distinguishing life from non-life based on AAs in a sample remains an unsolved problem, particularly when their isotopic and structural signatures (e.g., chirality) could be altered via physicochemical processes. Here we introduce LUMOS (Life Unveiled via Molecular Orbital Signatures), a statistical framework that distinguishes life from non-life by analyzing the distribution of abundance-weighted HOMO-LUMO gap (HLG) values of AAs within a sample. Compilation of AAs datasets from diverse environments and provenances revealed that abiotic samples display highly uniform distributions of AAs HLGs. In contrast, biotic samples show greater variance and preference towards AAs with lower HLG, likely reflecting the need for life to control when, where, and how chemical reactions occur. LUMOS achieves >95% accuracy in distinguishing biotic versus abiotic provenance across diverse environmental and extraterrestrial conditions. These results suggest that varied molecular reactivity within biochemical systems may be a universal feature of life, representing an agnostic biosignature unlinked to the specific set of AAs used by life as we know it. LUMOS is compatible with existing analytical instrumentation, applicable to returned samples or in situ analyses. Broader characterization of abiotic and biotic environments will further refine the chemical boundaries separating biotic from abiotic chemical systems.",

Companion data catalogue available at this https URL Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) I present the first systematic catalogue of simultaneous solar transits of both Phobos and Deimos as observed from the surface of Mars. Using the JPL mar099 ephemeris (Brozovic et al. 2025) and SPICE toolkit, I searched the millennium 1600-2600 CE for epochs at which both Martian moons project onto the solar disc at the same instant for at least one surface location. I identify 8565 grazing double transits, 49 partial-overlap double transits (both moons simultaneously on the solar disc, with at least one partially cut off by the limb), and 17 full double transits in which both moons lie wholly within the solar disc at the same moment. All events cluster tightly around the Martian equinoxes (Ls ~ 0 deg or 180 deg) and within +/- 9 deg of the equator, reflecting the near-equatorial orbital inclinations of both moons. I derive a hard theoretical latitude limit of +/- 13.1 deg beyond which simultaneous double transits are geometrically impossible. The next observable partial double transit, excluding less prominent grazing events, is predicted for 2034 April 17. The next full double transit, with both moons wholly inside the solar disc, with a gap between each silhouette and the solar limb, occurs on 2118 November 20. The geometries for both these events were confirmed with JPL Horizons. I provide uncertainty estimates based on the Brozovic et al. covariance model, with predicted position errors growing from ~1 km for near-term events to ~600 km at the catalogue boundaries, and note that the JAXA MMX mission (~2031) will dramatically reduce uncertainties for all post-2030 predictions.",

Submitted to AAS journals Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We present the first results from the POSEIDON survey, aimed at constraining the dynamical origins of transiting Neptunes through stellar obliquity measurements. We report Rossiter-McLaughlin observations of two Neptunes, TOI-181 b and TOI-883 b, obtained with high-resolution spectroscopy from Magellan/PFS and WIYN/NEID. TOI-181 b is on a 4.5-day orbit with a sky-projected spin-orbit misalignment $\\lambda = 32.0_{-6.5}^{+6.3}\\,^{\\circ}$ and a low eccentricity ($e<0.12$ with $2\\sigma$ confidence). TOI-883 b has a longer orbital period of 10 days with $\\lambda = 22_{-14}^{+15}\\,^{\\circ}$ and eccentricity $e = 0.16 \\pm 0.03$. The significant misalignment of TOI-181 b and the significant eccentricity of TOI-883 b are suggestive of high-eccentricity migration for both systems. After adding these and other new measurements to the sample, we analyze the obliquity distribution of the host stars of transiting Neptunes. Earlier studies had suggested that the obliquity distribution is bimodal, with peaks corresponding to aligned orbits and polar orbits; the addition of more measurements has weakened the evidence for bimodality. The current sample appears to be consistent with a population of well-aligned systems and a smaller population with nearly random obliquities. This distribution resembles that observed for more massive planets, suggesting that transiting Jupiters and Neptunes originate from similar dynamical processes.",

Alarcon, Javier Licandro, Miquel Serra-Ricart Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics. 14 pages, 6 figures Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The rotational properties of small near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) provide crucial insights into their internal structure and collisional history. However, systematic surveys targeting metre- to decametre-sized bodies are rare, thus leaving their spin distribution poorly constrained. Our aim was to quantify the prevalence of fast rotation and characterise the spin-rate distribution of small NEAs to constrain their internal strength and evolution. We conducted a dedicated high-cadence photometric survey of 249 NEAs using the Two-meter Twin Telescope (TTT). Rotation periods and amplitudes were derived from dense time series to classify objects as fast or non-fast rotators. We determined the rotation period of 156 new fast rotators (P < 2.2 h), including 87 that rotate faster than 10 min. The prevalence of fast rotators increases with absolute magnitude: from 60.6-80.3 % for 22 < H < 24 to 77.3-89.4 % for 24 < H < 26 and 94.1-96.1 % for H > 26, indicating that fast rotation dominates in the small NEA population. Most objects spin faster than the gravity-defined limit; 98 targets require cohesive strengths exceeding that of weak rubble piles, and 22 are compatible only with compact, high-strength interiors. This is the first systematic survey targeting the rotation of such small NEAs, providing the largest homogeneous sample of fast rotators obtained by a single campaign. Our findings demonstrate that fast rotation is the norm for objects smaller than tens of metres, implying that modest cohesive strength is required to prevent their rotational disruption.",

Article accepted for publication in Annales Geophysicae Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) We investigate the response of space weather events on Earth's upper atmosphere over the polar regions by studying their effect on the drag of the CHAMP and GRACE satellites. Increasing solar activity that results in heating and the expansion of the upper atmosphere threatens low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. Auroral events are closely related to the stellar energy deposition of solar EUV radiation and precipitating energetic electrons, which influence photochemical processes such as the production of nitric oxide (NO) in the upper atmosphere. To study the production of NO molecules and their influence on the thermospheric structure and satellite drag, we first model Earth's background thermosphere with the 1D upper atmosphere model Kompot by considering the incident X-ray, EUV, and IR radiation during selected space weather events. To investigate the effect of electron precipitation in the production of NO molecules in the polar thermosphere, we apply a Monte Carlo model accounting for the stochastic nature of collisional scattering of auroral electrons in collisions with the surrounding N$_2$-O$_2$ atmosphere, including the production of suprathermal N atoms. The observed effect of the atmospheric drag on CHAMP and GRACE during the two studied events indicates that a sporadic enhancement of NO molecule production in the polar thermosphere and its IR-cooling capability, which counteracts thermospheric expansion and can lead to an ``overcooling'' with decreased density after the space weather event, can have a protective effect on LEO satellites. Their production efficiency, however, is highly dependent on the energy flux of the precipitating electrons. Our results have direct implications for empirical satellite orbit prediction models, as our simulations highlight the need to consider precipitation-induced NO production to improve the predictive power of these models.",

Millour Accepted to Nature Communcations Earth & Enviorment Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph) On Mars, a relatively pure water ice layer lies beneath several centimeters of dry soil at mid-latitudes. Its widespread presence poleward of 60° latitude was detected by remote neutron spectroscopy and confirmed by the Phoenix lander at 68°N. Recent observations of exposed ice indicate that the near-surface ice layer extends to 35° latitude and exhibits pronounced spatial structure. However, previous models did not capture the observed spatial structure of the midlatitude ice layer. Here, on the basis of improved calculations using the Mars Planetary Climate Model, we show that mid-latitude buried ice could be the remnant of a ice layer deposited on the surface when the obliquity was higher than today. Assuming that the ice subsequently sublimated and became buried beneath a sublimation lag, we estimate that surface ice emplaced 630 kyr (4.18 Myr) ago at 35° obliquity (40°), at latitudes of 40-55°N, would today reside at depths of 25-150 (41-255) cm, depending on the regolith and ice properties. For ice emplaced 630 kyr ago, the modeled burial depths align with observations and capture the observed longitudinal depth variations, in contrast to ice emplaced 4.18 Myr ago. We therefore infer that the mid-latitude subsurface ice is younger than 4 Myr.",

      "abstract": "Surface Properties, Orbital Dynamics, and Thermophysical Modeling of the Primitive Asteroid (269) Justitia Leonardo Braga, Andre Amarante, Alessandra Ferreira, Filipe Monteiro, Maria Martins Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The Emirates Mission to the Asteroid Belt (EMA) will study the ultra-red asteroid (269)~Justitia. In this work, we present the first detailed investigation of Justitia's surface dynamics using the newly developed 3-D polyhedral shape model with 574 vertices and 1,144 faces. We analyze its geopotential, surface acceleration, escape speeds, slopes, and equilibrium points, and we also search for planar symmetric periodic orbits using an equivalent ellipsoidal approximation. Our results indicate that the lowest geopotential values occur at the poles, which also correspond to regions of maximum surface acceleration. The global slope distribution suggests preferred zones of material accumulation or migration, offering clues to Justitia's long-term morphological evolution. Most slopes remain below $40^\\circ$, implying that loose particles may settle stably across large portions of the surface. We identify five equilibrium points consistent with Justitia's estimated density and slow rotational period. Two external points (E$_2$ and E$_4$) exhibit linear stability, and all equilibrium locations lie relatively far from the surface due to the body's slow spin. Additionally, we discover 28 new families of planar symmetric periodic orbits, then classify their topologies and determine their linear stability, providing a dynamical framework relevant to future spacecraft operations near Justitia. Finally, thermal modeling reveals how thermal inertia and heliocentric distance shape Justitia's temperature distribution. The south pole receives more insolation than the north pole, reaching minimum temperatures of about 102~K and 87~K, respectively. These combined dynamical and thermal results offer valuable insights for the EMA mission and for understanding slowly rotating small bodies.",

      "abstract": "Weak S-type asteroids compared to C-type explain the observed size distribution of the main belt Michael Vávra, Miroslav Brož Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The main belt, the region between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, is home to more than 1 million asteroids. These asteroids form orbital groups, (i.e., asteroid families formed by collisions) and also spectral groups (taxonomies) with different chemical compositions, in particular carbonaceous (C-types) and silicate (S-types). In this paper, we extend the existing main-belt collisional model by finding the appropriate strength-versus-size dependence (also known as the scaling law) for these two groups. We used color indices and geometric albedos of 56 and 72 spectroscopically confirmed C- and S-types (control samples), along with statistical methods on 1 065 034 asteroids, to assign C-, S-, or other types. This allowed us to construct observed size-frequency distributions (SFDs) for several subpopulations constrained by either semimajor axis (inner, middle, outer) or taxonomy (C, S, other). Then we used a Monte Carlo collisional model to compute the long-term collisional evolution (4.5 billion years) and derive synthetic SFDs. Our best-fit scaling laws indicate that S-types must be weaker below approximately 0.2 km than C-types to explain the deficiency of asteroids in the inner part of the main belt near (and below) the observational limit. This may correspond to differences in chemical composition or material porosity. Future research will focus on the scaling laws of asteroids with rare or \"extreme\" taxonomies (e.g., V, M).",

This radiation-driven structure is an unusual environment for observations of planet formation and differs greatly from the low-mass star-forming regions disks are most commonly observed in. Aided by a collection of visual and spectroscopic data available for this system, this paper aims to infer the possibility of embedded planets existing within the disk and how the system's environment may affect its disk morphology. Using data from the VLT's instruments XSHOOTER, ESPRESSO and - most prominently - SPHERE along with data from ALMA, we make a variety of measurements (geometric, photometric and otherwise) to characterise the observed disk features and attributes such as spiral arms and eccentricity. Mapping of the velocity components is also undertaken using the ALMA gas line data to characterise disk orientation and determine the likelihood that the system is experiencing a late-stage infall event. The disk is found to be eccentric when deprojected. Under the assumption that the formation of a planet is wholly responsible for the primary and secondary spiral arms, we find the mass of such a planet can range between 0.004 and 3 Jupiter masses. Measurement of the velocities associated with nearby globule cloud material returns reasonable velocities for a late-stage infall event. We estimate far-ultraviolet field strength at AT Pyx's location to be low in comparison to other surveyed disks. We also find that AT Pyx is possibly a binary system. AT Pyx is the first disk within a cometary globule to be spatially resolved, and is now the first such disk to be investigated to this extent. The work of this paper could potentially be a first step into the further study of disks in the moderate-FUV environment of the Gum Nebula and its globules.",

Herald Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We provide context for Apophis' 2029 Earth passage by analyzing its possible source populations, in particular, the Flora family, which has a similar composition, corresponding to LL chondrite meteorites. Out of ${\\sim}3380$ NEOs larger or equal than Apophis (${\\ge}420\\,{\\rm m}$), $610\\pm 140$ are LL-like NEOs from Flora. Their mean encounter probability is $p = 86\\times 10^{-18}\\,{\\rm km}^{-2}\\,{\\rm y}^{-1}$, corresponding to once per 13000 y frequency of encounters closer than 38000 km. However, this does not apply to Apophis alone, for which the specific encounter probability is higher, $p' = 1603\\times 10^{-18}\\,{\\rm km}^{-2}\\,{\\rm y}^{-1}$, but the frequency is lower, only once per 430000 y, when we consider it as a single object. Our simulation of the Flora family over $\\sim$1 billion years indicates that Apophis-like bodies have orbits that are particularly persistent in near-Earth space. The temporal distribution of encounter probabilities exhibits peaks (up to ${>}10^4$ in the same units) and the specific value for Apophis is not unusual (occurring ${\\sim}70\\%$ of time). In other words, there is always at least one Apophis-like body among NEOs. We find that such persistence also creates favorable opportunities for temporary capture as Earth coorbitals. Apophis-like bodies are ultimately removed from the inner solar system by approaching the Sun or by impact into one of the terrestrial planets, where the relative split between these outcomes is $(45\\pm 2)\\,\\%$ and $(50\\pm 2)\\,\\%$. While our current knowledge of Apophis' orbit guarantees no threat from Apophis in the next few centuries, we cannot predict any specific outcome for Apophis in the coming thousands or millions of years. Evaluating this statistically over the long term, we find that objects in Apophis-like orbits have a $(19\\pm 2)\\,\\%$ chance of Earth impact over their lifetime of ${\\sim}30\\,{\\rm My}$.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We present deep, high-resolution ($\\sim$100 mas) Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) Ka-band (9.1 mm) observations of the disk around MWC 480, and infer dust properties through a combined analysis with archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) data at 0.87, 1.17, 1.33, and 3.0 mm. The prominent dust ring at 95 au (B95) is detected at 9.1 mm for the first time, while the faint outer ring at 160 au is not revealed. Through non-parametric visibility modeling, we identified two new annular features: a plateau within 20-50 au across all wavelengths, and a shoulder exterior to the B95 ring at 0.87, 1.17 and 1.33 mm, consistent with signatures of planet-disk interaction. We find that the width of the B95 ring remains constant across wavelengths, suggesting that fragmentation dominates over radial diffusion or that unresolved substructure is present within the ring. Resolved spectral modeling yields two families of dust solutions that reproduce the observations equally well: compact grains or highly porous (90\\%) grains, with carbonaceous components dominated by refractory organics or amorphous carbon, respectively. The inferred maximum grain sizes peak at the locations of the two rings and reach centimeter within the B95 ring. The total dust masses are $860^{+95}_{-78}\\rm~M_\\oplus$/$1500^{+440}_{-330}\\rm~M_\\oplus$ (large/small-grain solution in inner disk) and $230^{+14}_{-13}\\rm~M_\\oplus$ for the two dust mixtures. The B95 ring alone contains $100^{+5}_{-5}\\rm~M_\\oplus$ and $43^{+2}_{-2}\\rm~M_\\oplus$, respectively, sufficient to assemble the cores of giant planets. Finally, we highlight the power of broadband, multi-wavelength observations in placing better constraints on dust composition and porosity in protoplanetary disks.",

The planet is a close sibling in radius (1.24 $\\mathrm{R_{Jup}}$), temperature (1100 K), and mass (0.35 $\\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$) to the exceedingly well-characterized WASP-39b.

Stephens, Gavin Wang, Noriharu Watanabe, Francis P. Wilkin, Joe Williams Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We characterize the radius-dependent eccentricity distribution of 347 warm (P = 8-200 days) systems with only one transiting planetary candidate identified during Sectors 1-69 of the TESS mission. Using the ``photoeccentric effect'' in a hierarchical Bayesian framework, we first model the population using discrete planetary size bins (sub-Neptunes, sub-Saturns, and Jovians). We then develop a continuous mixture model with weights governed by a logistic sigmoid function of radius. We find that the warm-single population is best described by two components: a dominant low-eccentricity mode ( <e_low> = 0.070-0.068+0.026) and a secondary dynamically excited mode (<e_high> = 0.616-0.075+0.091). The fraction of planets belonging to this high-eccentricity component increases strongly with planet radius, characterized by a transition at a break radius of R_br = 9.8-1.1+1.4 R_e. This trend places warm sub-Saturns predominantly on the same low-eccentricity track as sub-Neptunes. In contrast, warm Jovians (8--16 R_e) are frequently eccentric, with 59+-13% of the population in the high eccentricity mode. We detect this bimodality at >4sigma, providing statistically significant evidence that warm gas giants are sculpted by two distinct pathways, or a single mechanism with subsequent eccentricity excitation. Finally, we identify a non-negligible tail of highly eccentric sub-Neptunes (1--4 R_e), which comprise 14.9-6.5+5.1% of the population, consistent with excitation by non-transiting external companions.",

In the tidally locked limit, the nightside's tendency to radiatively cool and potentially trap volatiles as permanent ice introduces a strong dependence of habitability on the planet's surface and atmospheric boundary conditions. We perform a suite of synchronously rotating experiments spanning a wide range of topographic and orographic realizations with different mean elevations and landmass distributions. Across a grid of $p_{\\mathrm{N2}} = 0.5$-$8~\\mathrm{bar}$ and $F_{\\star} = 1200$-$1700~\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$, we find that surface relief breaks the flow symmetry, replacing the circumpolar vortices with mechanically forced stationary waves. Steep orography produces standing Rossby gyres that strengthen the cross-terminator jet and align vertical uplift with the day--night boundary. These new circulation regimes enhance moisture transport, increasing the infrared optical depth and promoting additional nightside cloud formation, which produces a stronger cloud-greenhouse feedback and lower the critical fluxes required for global planetary deglaciation. Broad, elevated plateaus drive a similarly fragmented but slightly weaker circulation, yielding less effective moisture transport. These results show that the relief and spatial distribution of landmasses, parameters unconstrained for most exoplanets, can exert strong controls on the climatic bifurcations of tidally locked M-dwarf exoplanets.",

Our analysis uses more than 1400 RVs, including nearly 100 from NEID. The proper motion anomaly as measured by these two astrometric missions solves for the dynamical mass of HD 190360 b and contributes to our understanding of the overall system architecture, while the long baseline of RVs enables the robust characterization of HD 190360 c and confirms the discovery of HD 190360 d.",

Language editor corrected version Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Observations of exoplanetary atmospheres provide critical insights into their chemical composition, formation and evolution history. Ultra-hot Jupiters serve as excellent targets for atmospheric characterization; studies of these planets may yield key understanding of gas giant's formation and evolution history. We present a thermal emission study of WASP-33 b's dayside atmosphere, based on two secondary eclipse observations with CFHT/WIRCam in two specific narrow band filters, namely the CO and CH4$_{\\rm on}$ filters, and archival data with HST/WFC3 and Spitzer. Stellar pulsations of the host star induce some quasi-periodic photometric variations, particularly in the CH4$_{\\rm on}$ band, which are modelled and corrected in the high-precision differential light curves. An eclipse depth of $1565.2^{+228.6}_{-237.5}$ ppm and $914.3^{+56.1}_{-57.0}$ ppm is determined for the CO and CH4$_{\\rm on}$ bands, respectively. Combined with HST/WFC3 and Spitzer data, our joint retrieval of WASP-33 b's dayside atmosphere reveals a high metallicity ([Fe/H] $= 1.52^{+0.35}_{-0.52}$), high C/O ratio (C/O $= 0.78^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$), and a thermal inversion layer, suggesting a formation history involving metal-rich gas accretion. We confirm the presence of the molecules H$_{2}$O, H$^{-}$ and CO, and report a tentative detection of TiO in the dayside atmosphere of WASP-33 b. Future higher precision observations with JWST may provide better understand constraints on the chemical abundances of oxygen and refractory element abundances to better WASP-33 b's formation and evolutionary pathway.",
