      "abstract": "Probing Exotic Astrophysical Dark objects through Astrometric Microlensing from Gaia Lalit Singh Bhandari, Vikram Rentala, Arun M. Thalapillil, Himanshu Verma Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We present the first comprehensive study of astrometric microlensing by exotic astrophysical dark objects, focusing on two theoretically motivated models -- Q-ball and boson star. We demonstrate that these extended objects generate distinctive signatures that depart markedly from point-mass lenses like primordial black holes. The smoking-gun signature for these exotic objects is the emergence of caustics, which form when the lens radius is below a critical threshold. Crossing these caustics induces discontinuous jumps in the images-centroid trajectory, a distinctive feature of these extended dark objects. We show these patterns are sensitive to the internal mass profile, with boson stars generating larger, more prominent caustic structures than Q-balls -- enabling the models to be distinguished. Using the Gaia DR3 stellar catalogue, we forecast a high-yield discovery potential, up to $\\sim 6000$ detectable astrometric microlensing events for a 10-year mission, peaking for $M \\sim 1-10~M_\\odot$ and $R \\lesssim 10~\\text{AU}$. In the absence of anomalous detections, Gaia can set powerful 90% confidence level constraints on the fractional abundance of these exotic objects, reaching $f_{\\mathrm{DM}} \\le 10^{-3}$ in the peak region which covers masses from $10^{-1}-10^{7}~M_{\\odot}$ and radii $R<10^{6}~\\text{AU}$. Crucially, these projected astrometric microlensing constraints are significantly stronger than existing photometric microlensing limits in the $1-10~M_\\odot$ mass range. This work establishes astrometric microlensing with Gaia as a powerful, complementary, and near-future probe with the potential to discover exotic astrophysical dark objects.",

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of six representative DDE parametrization models by utilizing the latest and most precise CMB data jointly from ACT, SPT, and Planck, in conjunction with BAO data from DESI DR2 and SN data from DESY5, PantheonPlus, and Union3. Our overall analysis indicates that the preference for DDE in the Quintom-B regime remains robust, regardless of the DDE parameterization model and the data combination employed. The trend of this preference is significantly strengthened with the support of DESY5 SN data. Specifically, when using the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, for the Barboza-Alcaniz (BA) model, we obtain $w_0 = -0.785 \\pm 0.047$ and $w_a = -0.43^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, which significantly deviate from the $\\Lambda$CDM values and provide evidence for DDE at the $4.2\\sigma$ level. By the reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$, normalized dark energy density $f_{\\mathrm{DE}}(z)$, and the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, we also observe clear departures from $\\Lambda$CDM, further reinforcing the case for DDE. Furthermore, the Bayesian evidence analysis indicates that the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder, BA and Exponential models are moderately favored relative to $\\Lambda$CDM based on the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data.",

Vigeland Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have recently entered the detection era, quickly moving beyond the goal of simply improving sensitivity at the lowest frequencies for the sake of observing the stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB), and focusing on its accurate spectral characterization. While all PTA collaborations around the world use Fourier-domain Gaussian processes to model the GWB and intrinsic long time-correlated (red) noise, techniques to model the time-correlated radio frequency-dependent (chromatic) processes have varied from collaboration to collaboration. Here we test a new class of models for PTA data, Gaussian processes based on time-domain kernels that model the statistics of the chromatic processes starting from the covariance matrix. As we will show, these models can be effectively equivalent to Fourier-domain models in mitigating chromatic noise. This work presents a method for Bayesian model selection across the various choices of kernel as well as deterministic chromatic models for non-stationary chromatic events and the solar wind. As PTAs turn towards high frequency (>1/yr) sensitivity, the size of the basis used to model these processes will need to increase, and these time-domain models present some computational efficiencies compared to Fourier-domain models.",

Pang, Tim Dietrich, Chris Van Den Broeck High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Bayesian inference, widely used in gravitational-wave parameter estimation, depends on the choice of priors, i.e., on our previously existing knowledge. However, to investigate neutron star mergers, priors are often chosen in an agnostic way, leaving valuable information from nuclear physics and independent observations of neutron stars unused. In this work, we propose to encode information on neutron star physics into data-driven prior distributions constructed with normalizing flows, referred to as neural priors. These priors take input from constraints on the nuclear equation of state and neutron star population models. Applied to GW170817, GW190425, and GW230529, we highlight two contributions of the framework. First, we demonstrate its ability to provide source classification and to enable model selection of equation of state constraints for loud signals such as GW170817, directly from the gravitational-wave data. Second, we obtain narrower constraints on the source properties through these informed priors. As a result, the neural priors consistently recover higher luminosity distances compared to agnostic priors. Our method paves the way for classifying future ambiguous low-mass mergers observed through gravitational waves and for continuously incorporating advances in our understanding of neutron star properties into gravitational-wave data analysis.",

Such waves are within reach of future space-based interferometers such as LISA, DECIGO and BBO. In addition, primordial black hole binaries formed at late times produce merger gravitational waves that can be probed by the resonant cavity experiments in addition to DECIGO and BBO.",

Mishra, Varun Sahni 12 pages, 11 figures, double column Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Warm Inflation is a scenario in which the inflaton field dissipates its energy during inflation to maintain a subdominant constant radiation bath. Two of its remarkable features are (i) inflation can be realized even by very steep potentials and (ii) such a scenario doesn't call for a separate post-inflation reheating phase. We exploit the first feature to show that Warm Inflation can successfully take place on the very steep left wing of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential while remaining in excellent agreement with current cosmological data (joint analysis of Planck, ACT and DESI). The Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential has a flatter right wing as well, which opens up the possibility of dark energy when the field rolls along this wing. However in order to successfully realize quintessential inflation one needs to (i) normalize the two wings of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential differently in order to bridge between the two extreme energy scales of inflation and dark energy, (ii) allow the quintessence field to be dissipative, which is consistent with the presence of a dissipative term in warm inflation. The dissipative dynamics of the quintessence field is needed in order to sustain slow-roll in the right wing. With these modifications, we demonstrate that the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential can give rise to a unified model of warm inflation (on the left wing) and transient dark energy (on the right wing).",

Classical trans-dimensional Bayesian methods such as Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) provide asymptotically exact inference but can be computationally expensive. Instead, modern deep learning provides a faster alternative to inference but typically assume fixed component counts, sidestepping the core challenge of trans-dimensionality. To address this, we introduce SlotFlow, a deep learning architecture for trans-dimensional amortized inference. The architecture processes time-series observations, which we represent jointly in the frequency and time domains through parallel encoders. A classifier produces a distribution over component counts K, and its MAP estimate specifies the number of slots instantiated. Each slot is parameterized by a shared conditional normalizing flow trained via permutation-invariant Hungarian matching. On sinusoidal decomposition with up to 10 overlapping components and Gaussian noise, SlotFlow achieves 99.85% cardinality accuracy and well-calibrated parameter posteriors, with systematic biases well below one posterior standard deviation. Direct comparison with RJMCMC shows close agreement in amplitude and phase, with Wasserstein distances $W_2 < 0.01$ and $< 0.03$, indicating that shared global context captures inter-component structure despite a factorized posterior. Frequency posteriors remain centered but exhibit 2-3x broader intervals, consistent with an encoder bottleneck in retaining long-baseline phase coherence. The method delivers a $\\sim 10^6\\times$ speedup over RJMCMC, suggesting applicability to time-critical workflows in gravitational-wave astronomy, neural spike sorting, and object-centric vision.",

Mekuria, Amare Abebe 16 pages, 9 figures, and 2 tables Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this manuscript, we investigate late-time cosmology and the evolution of cosmic structures using an interacting dark fluid model in which dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) interact through a diffusive mechanism. To provide a comprehensive understanding, we derive the background evolution and perturbation equations within this model and obtain cosmological parameters through MCMC simulations. We use recent measurements for statistical analysis and constrain the parameters $H_0$ in km/s/Mpc, $\\Omega_m$, $r_d$, $M$, $\\sigma_8$, $S_8$, and the interaction term $Q_{dm}$. From the constrained values of $Q_{dm}$, we show that the diffusive model is a promising alternative DE model, capable of driving late-time cosmic acceleration due to energy exchange from DM to DE. State-finder diagnostics indicate that the model behaves like a Chaplygin gas when energy transfers from DM to DE during the Universe's expansion. We also investigate the growth of density contrast, finding $\\delta_m(z)\\gg\\delta_{de}(z)$, which highlights the dominant role of DM in structure formation. Redshift space distortion and growth rate analysis show that minor deviations from $\\Lambda$CDM at low redshifts, with larger differences at higher redshifts, indicate the impact of energy diffusion on early structure growth.

While the squeezed tensor non-Gaussianities in the standard slow-roll inflation with the Bunch-Davies vacuum state are suppressed due to the so-called consistency relation, those in extended models with the violation of the consistency relation can be enhanced. Among such extended models, we consider the inflation model with the non-Bunch-Davies state that is known to enhance the squeezed tensor non-Gaussianities. We explicitly formulate the primordial STT bispectrum induced during inflation in the context of Horndeski theory with the non-Bunch-Davies state and show that the induced SGWB anisotropies can be enhanced. We then discuss the detectability of those anisotropies in future gravitational wave experiments.",

Simulations of PBH formation have been essential for inferring the initial conditions that lead to black hole formation and for studying their properties and impact on our Universe. The Misner-Sharp formalism is commonly used as a standard approach for these simulations. Recently, type-II fluctuations, characterized by a non-monotonic areal radius, have gained interest. In the standard Misner-Sharp approach for simulating PBH formation with these fluctuations, the evolution equations exhibit divergent terms ($0/0$), which complicate and prevent the simulations. We formulate a new approach to overcome this issue in a simple manner by using the trace of the extrinsic curvature as an auxiliary variable, allowing simulations of type-II fluctuations within the Misner-Sharp formalism. Using a set of standard exponential-shaped curvature profiles, we apply and test our new approach and numerical code based on pseudospectral methods to study the time evolution of the gravitational collapse, threshold values of type A/B PBHs and PBH mass. Interestingly, we identify cases of type-II fluctuations that do not necessarily result in PBH formation.",

These fields depend on the geometry and matter-energy composition, can display complicated behavior such as direction reversals, and are intimately related to the evolution of the source galaxy. Simultaneously, gravitational-wave astronomy offers a new probe into astrophysical systems, for example the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will observe the mergers of massive (i.e., $M ~> 10^6$ M$_{\\odot}$) black-hole binaries and provide extraordinary constraints on the evolution of their galactic hosts. In this work, we show how galactic, large-scale magnetic fields and their electromagnetic signatures are connected with LISA gravitational-wave observations via their common dependence on the massive black-hole binary formation scenario of hierarchical galaxy mergers. Combining existing codes, we astrophysically evolve a population of massive binaries from formation to merger and find that they are detectable by LISA with signal-to-noise ratio $\\sim 10^3$ which is correlated with quantities from the progenitors' phase of circumbinary disk migration such as the maximum magnetic field magnitude $|\\mathbf{B}| \\approx 7 \\,\\mu$G, polarized intensity, and Faraday rotation measure. Interesting correlations result between these observables arising from their dependencies on the black-hole binary total mass, suggesting a need for further analyses of the full parameter space. We conclude with a discussion on this new multi-messenger window into galactic magnetic fields.",

International Journal of Modern Physics D, 34 (2025) 13, 2550059 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) dark matter particles and primordial black holes (PBHs) emerge as plausible candidates for dark matter. In scenarios where dark matter is a mix of KK particles and PBHs, PBHs can attract surrounding KK dark matter particles post-formation, leading to the creation of ultracompact dark matter halos (UCMHs). The distribution of KK dark matter particles within UCMHs tends to be steeper than in classical dark matter halo structures, such as the Navarro-Frenk-White model. Consequently, the annihilation rate of KK dark matter particles in UCMHs is significant. The high-energy photons resulting from the annihilation of KK particles in UCMHs contribute to the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB). Leveraging data from the $\\mathtt{Fermi\\text{-}LAT}$ experiment, we have derived, for the first time, upper limits on the cosmological abundance of PBHs in the context of KK dark matter annihilation. For a KK dark matter mass range of $500\\le m_{\\rm B^{(1)}}\\le 1500$ GeV, which aligns with the observed present abundance of dark matter, the conservative limits on the fraction of dark matter in PBHs, for massive PBHs with $M_{\\rm PBH}\\gtrsim 10^{-11}M_{\\odot}$, are $f_{\\rm PBH} \\lesssim 2\\times 10^{-5}$.",

We present and apply a novel non-parametric framework for modeling multi-dimensional, correlated distributions based on Delaunay triangulation. Crucially, the complexity of the model -- namely, the number, positions, and weights of triangulation nodes -- is inferred directly from the data, resulting in a highly efficient approach that requires about one to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters and significantly less calibration than current state-of-the-art methods.

A comprehensive survey of Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) in the Large Scale Structure (LSS), in stratified data covering a finite redshift range is provided by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Extracting cosmological parameters in a joint analysis of LSS-CMB data is hereby inherently a nonlinear problem. Aims. In particular, this nonlinearity may concern the unknown equation of state of dark energy w(a), defined in the general w(a)CDM framework. Nevertheless, a common approach is the linearized approximation hereto notably w0waCDM, also applied by DESI. Here, we consider a potential source of a systematic uncertainty in this linearization due to non-commutativity between w0waCDM and a posteriori linearization of w(a)CDM, identified with an intrinsic symmetry in the latter, which is violated in the former. We shall refer to these as early and late linearization, respectively. Methods. Observational consequences of symmetry violation is inherent to early linearization regardless of choice of data, here elucidated in the analysis of the Hubble expansion in the Local Distance Ladder (LDL) using cosmic chronometer data. Results. Strikingly, opposite results are found for the evolution of dark energy by early versus late linearization, indicating a thawing or respectively, increasing dark energy. This is further confirmed by mock data experiments. Accordingly, it is unlikely that the DESI pipeline is immune to the same contradiction. Conclusions. Our results show rather than thawing, claimed by DESI, dark energy may in fact be increasing upon preserving the underlying symmetry. Further confirmation is expected from Euclid.",

We consider the role of the cosmological constant in local structure formation via the theorem on the general function that satisfies the identity of the gravity of the sphere and of the point mass. Then, the Hubble tension is naturally explained as a result of two flows, a local and a global one, with non-coinciding Hubble parameters. The linearized Vlasov-Poisson equation with the cosmological term is shown to lead to van Kampen's waves, Landau damping, and then to aperiodic structures. Aperiodicity thereby emerges as a intrinsic feature of the filamentary and void structure of the local Universe, and reveals the self-consistent field mechanism of its formation. The damping of the aperiodicity is then predicted and can be observationally traced upon the increase in the scale of the filaments.",

We investigate the cosmological evolution and optical appearance of black holes in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity coupled with Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy (KHDE). Utilizing Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) datasets, we constrain model parameters via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. Results indicate that the late-time universe statistically favors a phantom-like equation of state ($c \\approx 0.704$). Regarding the EGB coupling $\\alpha$, although data favor a positive value, the parameter space permits negative values down to a theoretical stability cut-off at $\\alpha \\approx -0.03$. While the best-fit suggests deviation, results remain consistent with General Relativity ($\\alpha=0$) within the $2\\sigma$ confidence level. Based on these constraints, we model the secular mass accretion history (treating accretion efficiency as a phenomenological constant) and compute the shadow radius evolution. We find that in a realistic dispersive plasma environment, refractive effects significantly mask intrinsic gravitational and dark energy signatures, causing global shadow shrinkage. Nevertheless, a characteristic systematic intrinsic deviation of $\\sim 1\\%$--$1.5\\%$ (under a conservative accretion scenario) persists at redshifts $z \\lesssim 1.5$ relative to standard $\\Lambda$CDM predictions. These findings suggest that despite environmental dominance, precise statistical analyses of shadow populations could disentangle these subtle dynamic dark energy signals from the standard cosmological paradigm.",

Moreover, examining orientation-only correlation functions from ellipticity-normalized galaxies $\\tilde w_{m+}$, we confirm that alignment signals retain sensitivity to supernova feedback across full, star forming, quiescent, and ellipticity-normalized samples. Finally, we find evidence that supernova feedback impacts alignment signals differently in star-forming versus quiescent populations, suggesting that distinct alignment mechanisms operate across galaxy types.

The advent of exascale computing now enables a new generation of simulations that couple these physical processes across full-sky volumes with excellent statistical sampling of large-scale structure tracers such as galaxies, groups, and clusters. To support these efforts, we extend the CRK-HACC framework, a GPU-accelerated cosmological hydrodynamics code, with a suite of astrophysical subgrid models that simulate radiative cooling, star formation, stellar evolution, and AGN feedback within a numerically robust formulation optimized for scalability on modern exascale architectures. The models were selected and calibrated to reproduce observed galaxy stellar mass functions over the redshift range $0 < z < 2$ and cluster populations probed by cosmological surveys, capturing the large-scale baryonic evolution relevant for multi-wavelength, cross-correlated analyses. We describe the implementation and calibration of these models and demonstrate their consistency with observed galaxy population statistics and modern hydrodynamic simulations, establishing the baseline for exascale efforts that extend this framework to survey-scale volumes.",

Submitted to Physical Review D Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Large-scale $B$-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a prime target for current and future experiments in search of primordial gravitational waves (PGW). With increasingly sensitive instruments being deployed, secondary $B$-modes induced by the weak gravitational lensing of CMB photons are becoming an important limitation and need to be removed, a process known as delensing. In this work, we combine internally reconstructed CMB lensing maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 with galaxy samples from unWISE and a map of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) fluctuations from Planck to produce a well-correlated tracer of the CMB lensing field. Our co-added tracer, shown to be 55-85% correlated with the true lensing convergence at multipoles $L \\leq 2000$, is then convolved with ACT DR6 $E$-mode polarization to yield a template of the lensing $B$-modes. We assess its performance on a wide range of scales by using it to delens ACT DR6 and Planck $B$-modes over 23% of the sky, removing around 39% of the lensing power at $100\\leq l \\leq 1500$ and 47% at $30 \\leq l \\leq 300$, respectively. Our template achieves the highest delensing efficiency to date and will be useful for the analysis of early polarization maps from the Simons Observatory (SO). We finally outline prospects for further improvements by including additional large-scale structure tracers from upcoming cosmological surveys.",

The model includes radiation, non-relativistic matter, and a dark-energy component with constant equation-of-state parameter w. An explicit Euler scheme implemented in Python is used to evolve a(t) into the past and the future, allowing exploration of the qualitative behavior of the expansion for different values of w, including the LCDM case (w = -1), phantom energy (w < -1), and values associated with domain walls and cosmic strings.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Nonthermal emission observed in galaxy clusters provides a direct probe into the plasma physics of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) under extreme conditions. We report the first detailed analysis of the giant radio halo in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 2163, using upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) and Very Large Array (VLA) observations. Combining radio data (300-1400 MHz) with archival X-ray data offers a unique opportunity to study the complex ICM physics of the cluster. The sensitive uGMRT observations map the halo emission for the first time out to an extent of ~3.3 Mpc, up to $r_{500}$, and also effectively recover other diffuse sources. The radio surface brightness profile is well fitted with an exponential function up to r$_{500}$, with an evolution of e-folding radius over frequencies (larger at low frequencies). The spatially resolved spectral index map reveals fluctuations and outward radial steepening of the average spectral index. Radio and X-ray surface brightness are well correlated, with a correlation slope of $\\sim$0.70 for the halo, and $\\sim$0.40 for the ridge. The correlation slope varies from cluster centre to outskirts, suggesting the magnetic field and thermal gas density scaling relation (B $\\propto n_{e}^{0.5}$) should be reassessed, provided that the re-acceleration efficiency is constant. We propose that diffuse lobes at the periphery could serve as a reservoir for seed electrons, behind the radio halo emission, with an estimated acceleration efficiency reaching $\\sim$0.1% in the external regions. Additionally, a major E-W merger is suggested, leading to turbulence in the ICM and generating the halo.",

Novikov, A.O. Mihalchenko Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We present a Gaussianity test of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization by analyzing the statistics of unpolarized points in the sky, classified into three distinct types: saddles, comets, and beaks. This classification of singular points where both Stokes parameters $Q$ and $U$ vanish stems from the fact that linear polarization is described by a second-rank tensor. By varying the number of spherical harmonics included in the polarization maps, one can probe the statistics of these singularities across a range of angular scales. Applying this method to Planck data we find clear evidence of non-Gaussianity in both $E$ and $B$ modes of polarization. This approach may be especially useful for processing data from current and future experiments such as the Simons Observatory (SO). In particular, it can help to assess the Gaussianity of a potentially detected B mode signal, thereby determining whether it arises from primordial tensor perturbations -- as predicted by inflation -- or from alternative sources such as polarized foregrounds (e.g., thermal dust), E-to-B mode leakage, systematics, photon noise or gravitational lensing. We have made publicly available software that finds unpolarized points of all three types on any polarization map in Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelation (HEALPix) format with full or incomplete sky coverage to enable testing of the observed signal for Gaussianity.",

Cross-correlating high-redshift tracer samples with the CMB lensing potential offers a particularly robust probe of PNGs, mitigating imaging systematics that typically affect large-scale measurements from tracer auto-spectra. In this context, UNIONS enables the selection of $u$-dropout high-redshift Lyman-Break Galaxies (LBGs). We perform a MCMC-based forecast to estimate the uncertainties on $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc}$ and on a galaxy bias parameter, which captures our uncertainty in the tracer bias. From the angular cross-power spectrum between LBGs and Planck CMB lensing, we forecast $\\sigma(f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc})=34$ for an idealized photometric sample of $r<24.3$ LBGs selected with a Random Forest classification algorithm from UNIONS-like $ugriz$ imaging, with a resulting surface density of $1,100$ deg$^{-2}$. This precision can be improved to $\\sigma(f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc})=20$ after spectroscopic follow-up with DESI, during its next phase starting in 2029, DESI-II. We test a more realistic $u$-dropout LBG selection using early UNIONS data, which yields a denser sample of $r<24.2$ objects at $1,400$ deg$^{-2}$. From this sample, covering a larger footprint and expected to have a higher large-scale galaxy bias, we forecast $\\sigma(f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc})=20$, with similar precision achievable after DESI spectroscopic follow-up. In addition, we perform preliminary validation of the redshift distribution using the clustering-redshift method with DESI DR1 data, confirming the calibration from deep, small-area photometric fields. However, accounting for uncertainties in the clustering-redshift distribution significantly degrades the $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc}$ constraining power.",

Hergt, Stephane Ilić, Miren Muñoz-Echeverría, Etienne Pointecouteau, Laura Salvati, Matthieu Tristram Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) High-precision measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) will soon allow for the unprecedented detection of small-scale secondary anisotropies, such as the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. Linking the kSZ power spectrum to the properties of ionising sources would provide an opportunity to use such observations to access astrophysical and cosmological information from the Epoch of Reionisation, including the morphology of ionised regions, while simultaneously improving CMB analyses. The aim of this work is to assess this potential of the kSZ power spectrum to measure reionisation-era galaxy properties. We repurpose the publicly available LoReLi II simulations, which track the evolution of neutral hydrogen during reionisation, to generate a training set of patchy kSZ angular power spectra. We then train an emulator using neural network regression in order to allow for efficient Bayesian inference, and conduct forecasts assuming mock observations from current and future CMB experiments. We find that measurements of the kSZ power spectrum from such surveys can provide meaningful constraints on several of the astrophysical model parameters of the LoReLi II suite, including the ionising escape fraction for which we expect a 14% relative error, on average. They also provide an independent measurement of the CMB optical depth, marginalised over the astrophysics and with error bars competitive with the cosmic variance limit from large scale surveys. The kSZ power spectrum offers a promising avenue for probing the properties of reionisation-era galaxies and providing an independent measurement of the CMB optical depth with upcoming CMB experiments. Since the error budget of our mock observations is dominated by emulator reconstruction errors, we expect our results could be further improved with a more extended simulation training set.",

We aim to understand the relationship between the power of AGN feedback and the cooling of gas in the centres of galaxy clusters by correlating the radio properties of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) with the X-ray properties of their host clusters. We used catalogues from the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) along with ASKAP radio data. In total, we identified 134 radio sources associated with BCGs of the 151 eRASS1 clusters located in the PS1, PS2, and SWAG-X ASKAP fields. Non-detections were treated as upper limits. We correlated BCG radio luminosity, largest linear size (LLS), and BCG offset with the integrated X-ray luminosity of their host clusters. To characterise cool cores (CCs) and non-cool cores (NCCs), we used the concentration parameter $c_{R_{500}}$ and combined it with the BCG offset to assess cluster dynamical state. We analysed the correlation between radio mechanical power and X-ray luminosity within the CC subsample. We observe a potential positive trend between LLS and BCG offset, suggesting an environmental effect on radio-source morphology. We find a weak trend where more luminous central radio galaxies are found in clusters with higher X-ray luminosity. Within the CC subsample, there is a positive but highly scattered relationship between the mechanical luminosity of AGN jets and the X-ray cooling luminosity. This finding is supported by bootstrap resampling and flux-flux analyses. The correlation indicates that AGN feedback is ineffective in high-luminosity (high-mass) clusters. At a cooling luminosity of $L_{\\mathrm{X},~r<R_\\mathrm{cool}}\\approx 5.50\\times10^{43}$ erg/s, on average, AGN feedback appears to contribute only about 13%-22% of the energy needed to offset the radiative losses in the ICM.",

Saridakis, Yi-Fu Cai Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We investigate the clustering properties of dynamical dark energy using the latest cosmological observations. We describe the dark energy perturbation within two complementary frameworks, namely the Parameterized Post-Friedmann (PPF) approach and the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of dark energy. Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations together with Planck 2018 CMB data and the Union3 supernova sample, we constrain the effective sound speed of dark energy in both the $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM backgrounds. Within the PPF description, the sound speed remains unconstrained for $w$CDM, while for the $w_0w_a$CDM case we obtain $\\log_{10} c_s^2 = -3.00^{+2.9}_{-0.99}$. Additionally, in the EFT framework, both models favor a small sound speed, with a mean value $c_s^2 \\simeq 0.3$--$0.4$ but with significant uncertainties. For dynamical dark energy, the reconstructed equation of state clearly exhibits a quintom-B behavior, and its deviation from $\\Lambda$CDM reaches $3.42\\sigma$, rising to $3.63\\sigma$ when PPF perturbations are included and reducing to $3.19\\sigma$ in the EFT case. Finally, model comparison using information criteria shows that the $w_0w_a$CDM model with a smooth, non-clustering dark energy component ($c_s^2 = 1$) is preferred by AIC, whereas BIC favors $\\Lambda$CDM. In summary, current data indicate a mild preference for dynamical dark energy but no evidence for significant clustering, which implies the need for future high-precision observations to probe the perturbative behavior more definitively.",

Giman, Pran Nath 30 pages, 8 figures and 3 tables Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) An analysis is given of interacting dark energy and dark matter where the dark energy is assumed to be an ultralight axionic field with a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson potential which is in general a superposition of $N$ number of cosine terms motivated by supergravity and string models with a $U(1)$ global symmetry, where the symmetry is broken by instanton effects. The case $N=2$ is investigated in detail and a fit to cosmological data is performed where it is found that a better fit is obtained in comparison with the $N=1$ case. The fits also constrain high scale parameters, i.e., the axion decay constant which is determined to be sub-Planckian, a result consistent with string theory that disfavors trans-Planckian axion decay constant. Furthermore, the dark energy-dark matter interaction strength is constrained to be feeble, i.e., $\\lambda\\lesssim 4\\times 10^{-6}$ m$_{\\rm Pl}^{-2}$ Mpc$^{-2}$. We study possible implications of this type of potential on the Hubble tension and on the dynamics of the dark energy equation of state using the DESI-DR2 data. For the cases $N=3,4$, the analysis exhibits the phenomenon of transmutation even in the absence of coupling to dark matter, where thawing quintessence transmutes to freezing quintessence. The analysis is internally consistent in its treatment of the dark energy-dark matter interaction as it is based on an underlying Lagrangian, in contrast with several previous works where the sources are chosen in an ad hoc manner to satisfy energy conservation.",

These haloes can be represented as nodes of a graph, whose structural properties reflect cosmological parameters. Aims. Using our new MAKITRA suite of cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulations covering a total volume of $(300\\,\\text{Mpc})^3$ and with 21 physical model variations (including variations of $\\sigma_8$ and of different models of primordial magnetic fields, PMFs), we investigate the sensitivity of network-based statistics describing the Cosmic Web to variations in cosmological and PMF scenarios. Methods. We focus on several complementary metrics that characterise the spatial distribution of dark and baryonic matter haloes: two-point correlation functions, network-centrality statistics, and counts-in-cell measurements. We first compare the halo-halo correlation functions across different cosmological models. For the network analysis, we represent haloes as vertices of the Cosmic Web and compute multiple centrality measures, whose cumulative distributions we evaluate for universes with varying PMF strengths. Finally, we quantify halo abundances within randomly placed spheres of fixed radius to assess differences between scenarios. Results. First, we find that the statistics of the centralities of the network can serve as a novel sensitive probe of the cosmological parameter $\\sigma_8$.

We test our method on 400 E and B polarization simulations based on the LiteBIRD experiment, containing the two main sources of contamination for CMB polarization experiments: polarized dust and synchrotron emission. We show that the bispectrum does not improve the precision of the power spectrum estimation or of the spectral parameters. However, we are capable of recovering the correct 3-point correlator of the foregrounds and standard constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity in a coherent multi-frequency and multi-component framework.

Specifically, the relative alignments of the dark matter (DM) halo, stars, and hot intracluster gas in these clusters offer insights into how well theoretical structure predictions hold. We measure the position angles, ellipticities, and locations/centroids of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), the Intracluster Light (ICL), the hot Intracluster Medium (ICM), and the Core Lensing Mass (CLM) for a sample of strong lensing galaxy clusters from the Sloan Giant Arcs Survey (SGAS). We measure the shapes (position angles and ellipticities) and centroids of these distributions using ellipse-fitting methods applied to different datasets: HST WFC3 imaging for the BCG and ICL, Chandra X-ray observations for the ICM, and strong-lensing mass reconstructions for the CLM. Additionally, we incorporate ICM morphological measures to classify the dynamical state of the cluster sample. Using this multi-component approach, we constrain the shape and centroids of these distributions in this sample and evaluate the different observable components in terms of their ability to trace the gravitational potential of their respective clusters. We find that misalignments between cluster components can be explained by astrophysical processes related to cluster assembly, relaxation, and merger histories. We find that the ICL is most closely aligned with its host DM halo, as traced by the CLM distribution, in both position angle and centroid. Additionally, we find that on average the ICL and CLM are more elliptical than the ICM and BCG.",

Mainetti Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Synergies between large-scale radio-continuum and optical/near-infrared galaxy surveys are a powerful tool for cosmology. Cross-correlating these surveys can constrain the redshift distribution of radio sources, mitigate systematic effects, and place constraints on cosmological models. We perform the first measurement of the clustering cross-spectrum between radio-continuum sources in the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey and galaxies from the ESA Euclid satellite mission's Q1 release. Our goal is to detect and characterise the cross-correlation signal, test its robustness against systematic effects, and compare our measurements with theoretical predictions. We use data from the Australian SKA Pathfinder's EMU Main Survey, which overlaps with the Euclid Deep Field South. We generate two radio-source catalogues using different source finders to create galaxy maps. We measure the harmonic-space cross-correlation signal using a pseudo-spectrum estimator. The measured signal is compared to theoretical predictions based on a {\\Lambda}CDM cosmology, using several models for the EMU source redshift distribution and bias. We report detection above 8{\\sigma} of the cross-correlation signal consistent across all tested models and data sets. The measured cross-spectra from the two radio catalogues are in excellent agreement, demonstrating that the cross-correlation is robust against the choice of source-finding algorithm. The measured signal also agrees with theoretical models developed from previous cross-correlation studies and simulations. This pathfinder study establishes a statistically significant cross-correlation between EMU and Euclid. The robustness of the signal is a crucial validation of the methodology, paving the way for future large-scale analyses leveraging the full power of this synergy to constrain cosmological parameters and our understanding of galaxy evolution.",

      "abstract": "The Shear-to-Cosmology Paradigm I: Hybrid Field-Level and Simulation-Based Framework for Weak Lensing Surveys Jiacheng Ding, Chen Su, Ji Yao, Le Zhang, Huanyuan Shan Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Precise cosmological inference from next-generation weak lensing surveys requires extracting non-Gaussian information beyond standard two-point statistics. We present a hybrid machine-learning (ML) framework that integrates field-level inference (FLI) with simulation-based inference (SBI) to map observed shear fields directly to cosmological parameters, eliminating the need for convergence reconstruction. The FLI network extracts rich non-Gaussian information from the shear field to produce informative features, which are then used by SBI to model the resulting complex posteriors. To mitigate noise from intrinsic galaxy shapes, we develop a blind, training-free, PCA-based shear denoising method. Tests on CSST-like mock catalogs reveal significant performance gains. The shear-based inference achieves approximately twice the cosmological constraining power in Figure of Merit (FoM) compared to the conventional convergence-based approach. Moreover, the combination of PCA denoising and ML compression can deliver a 36.4% improvement in FoM over standard shear two-point statistics. This work establishes a scalable and robust pathway for cosmological inference, unlocking the full potential of Stage-IV weak-lensing surveys.",

A commonly used solution is to slightly break the PQ symmetry by introducing a bias term in the potential. In this work, we propose an alternative, symmetry-preserving mechanism: coupling the axion field to a helical primordial magnetic field (PMF) via the Chern-Simons term. Using three-dimensional lattice simulations, we evolve the DW network and demonstrate that it can successfully drive DW decay. Our quantitative results further show that the correlation length of the PMF plays a crucial role in determining the decay rate of the DW network and the resulting axion and gravitational wave radiation.",

For fermions with a Yukawa coupling to a sufficiently light scalar mediator, rapid oscillations of the scalar field can lead to a conservative force law with fractional behaviour on sufficiently large scales. We study cosmological systems evolving under both this fractional potential and the Newtonian potential using high-resolution N-body simulations. We find that, at the same mass scale, halos that form under the fractional potential are much more dense than those that from the Newtonian potential. However, we also find that the perturbed scalar field may have large fluctuations once halo sizes become comparable to an effective Compton length, which will modify subsequent clustering and collapse.",

Accepted for publication in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Machine Learning (cs.LG) Dark matter haloes are typically characterised by radial density profiles with fixed forms motivated by simulations (e.g. NFW). However, simulation predictions depend on uncertain dark matter physics and baryonic modelling. Here, we present a method to constrain halo density profiles directly from observations using Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR), a technique that searches the space of analytic expressions for the function that best balances accuracy and simplicity for a given dataset. We test the approach on mock weak lensing excess surface density (ESD) data of synthetic clusters with NFW profiles. Motivated by real data, we assign each ESD data point a constant fractional uncertainty and vary this uncertainty and the number of clusters to probe how data precision and sample size affect model selection. For fractional errors around 5%, ESR recovers the NFW profile even from samples as small as 20 clusters. At higher uncertainties representative of current surveys, simpler functions are favoured over NFW, though it remains competitive. This preference arises because weak lensing errors are smallest in the outskirts, causing the fits to be dominated by the outer profile. ESR therefore provides a robust, simulation-independent framework both for testing mass models and determining which features of a halo's density profile are genuinely constrained by the data.",

This represents the highest-significance pairwise kSZ measurement to date. The analysis uses three ACT CMB temperature maps: co-added 150 GHz, total frequency maps, and a component-separated Internal Linear Combination (ILC) map, all of which cover 19,000 square degrees of the sky from Advanced ACTPol observations conducted between 2017 and 2022. Comparison of the results of these three maps serves as a consistency check for potential foreground contamination that may depend on the observation frequency. An estimate of the best-fit mass-averaged optical depth is obtained by comparing the pairwise kSZ curve with the linear-theory prediction of the pairwise velocity under the best-fit Planck cosmology, and is compared with predictions from simulations. This estimate serves as a reference point for future comparisons with thermal SZ-derived optical depth measurements for the same DESI cluster samples, which will be presented in a companion paper. Finally, we employ a machine-learning approach trained on simulations to estimate the optical depth for 456,803 DESI LRG-identified clusters within the simulated mass range (greater than about 1e13 solar masses). These are combined with the measured kSZ signal to infer the individual cluster peculiar velocities, providing the opportunity to constrain the behavior of gravity and the dark sector over a range of cosmic scales and epochs.",

Sharma Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We propose a cosmological framework in which neutrino masses evolve dynamically through coupling with a scalar field that simultaneously drives inflation. The neutrino mass is modeled as a power-law, exponential, or hybrid function of the scalar field, yielding an effective potential that includes neutrino backreaction. Starting from the Einstein-Hilbert action in a flat FLRW background, we derive the modified Friedmann and Klein Gordon equations incorporating this coupling. Using the Fermi-Dirac integrals, we account for the continuous transition of neutrinos from relativistic to non-relativistic regimes. The inflationary dynamics are analyzed via the slow roll parameters derived from the effective potential. Our results show that the scalar neutrino coupling alters the potential slope and curvature, thereby influencing the duration of inflation. The hybrid coupling form provides the most flexible realization, unifying neutrino mass generation with early universe inflation within a single scalar field framework.",

Chains and data to reproduce the figures available at this https URL Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present a new measurement of the Hubble constant, independent of standard rulers and robust to pre-recombination modifications such as Early Dark Energy (EDE), obtained by calibrating the total energy density of the Universe. We start using the present-day photon density as an anchor, and use the baryon-to-photon ratio from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis based measurements and the baryon-to-matter ratio from the baryons' imprint on galaxy clustering to translate to a physical matter density at present day. We then compare this to measurements of the ratio of the matter density to the critical density ($\\Omega_{\\mathrm{m}}$), calculated using the relative positions of the baryon acoustic oscillations, to measure the critical density of the universe and hence $H_0$. The important measurements of the evolution of the energy density all happen at low redshift, so we consider this a low-redshift measurement. We validate our method both on a suite of $N$-body mocks and on noiseless theory vectors generated across a wide range of Hubble parameters in both $\\Lambda$CDM and EDE cosmologies. Using DESI DR1 data combined with the angular CMB acoustic scale and the latest BBN constraints, we find $H_0 = 69.0 \\pm 2.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, consistent with existing early and late-time determinations of the Hubble constant. We consider the impact of non-standard dark energy evolution on our measurement. Future data, including that from further iterations of DESI and from Euclid, will add to these results providing a powerful test of the Hubble tension.",

Silber, David Sprayberry, Gregory Tarlé, Benjamin A. Weaver, Rongpu Zhou, Hu Zou Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Galaxy clustering constrains the baryon fraction Omega_b/Omega_m through the amplitude of baryon acoustic oscillations and the suppression of perturbations entering the horizon before recombination. This produces a different pre-recombination distribution of baryons and dark matter. After recombination, the gravitational potential responds to both components in proportion to their mass, allowing robust measurement of the baryon fraction. This is independent of new-physics scenarios altering the recombination background (e.g. Early Dark Energy). The accuracy of such measurements does, however, depend on how baryons and CDM are modeled in the power spectrum. Previous template-based splitting relied on approximate transfer functions that neglected part of information. We present a new method that embeds an extra parameter controlling the balance between baryons and dark matter in the growth terms of the perturbation equations in the CAMB Boltzmann solver. This approach captures the baryonic suppression of CDM prior to recombination, avoids inconsistencies, and yields a clean parametrization of the baryon fraction in the linear power spectrum, separating out the simple physics of growth due to the combined matter potential. We implement this framework in an analysis pipeline using Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure with HOD-informed priors and validate it against noiseless LCDM and EDE cosmologies with DESI-like errors. The new scheme achieves comparable precision to previous splitting while reducing systematic biases, providing a more robust way to baryon-fraction measurements. In combination with BBN constraints on the baryon density and Alcock-Paczynski estimates of the matter density, these results strengthen the use of baryon fraction measurements to derive a Hubble constant from energy densities, with future DESI and Euclid data expected to deliver competitive constraints.",

Sullivan Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Recent results from DESI BAO analyses suggest that dark energy may not be a cosmological constant and is in fact dynamical. Furthermore, the data suggest that the equation of state may have been in the phantom regime in the distant past, recently undergoing a phantom crossing. In this work, we investigate whether this preference can be realized within a kinetically mixed axion-dilaton (KMIX) quintessence model, a string-motivated system in which an axion-like field couples exponentially to a dilaton-like (moduli) field. Crucially, KMIX can appear phantom in a standard Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) based analysis. To confront the model with data, we develop a fast pipeline based on normalizing flows that (i) learns a theory-informed prior on $(w_0,w_a)$ from KMIX realizations and (ii) provides an inverse mapping from CPL parameters back to the physical KMIX parameters. By importance-sampling pre-computed CPL chains using this framework, we effectively transform generic phenomenological constraints into direct, computationally efficient constraints on the underlying KMIX theory, avoiding the prohibitive cost of full parameter space exploration. Applied to Planck+DESI DR2 BAO measurements, our framework finds support for KMIX at $2.5\\sigma$ compared to the base CPL fit at $3.1\\sigma$, demonstrating that KMIX may account for the DESI preference without invoking true phantom behavior. When additionally including Type Ia supernovae data, we find that the preference remains above $3\\sigma$ for Union3 and DES Y5, but drops to $2.1\\sigma$ with Pantheon+. The latter, combined with the DESI full-shape power spectrum and bispectrum data, further reduces the preference to $1.7\\sigma$. Ultimately, should the DESI deviation persist with future data, KMIX may offer a theoretically well-motivated explanation for the phantom-like signatures inferred from phenomenological fits.",

Doppel, Rüdiger Pakmor, Adrian Jenkins 21 pages, 9 figures, submitted to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present a suite of zoom-in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies using the LYRA galaxy formation model with an extremely high mass resolution of $4\\, \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$, evolved to $z=0$. The suite contains 65 haloes selected from Local Group like environments, spanning $M_{\\mathrm{200c}}=10^7$ to $5\\times10^9\\, \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$. The sample includes small ultra-faints with $M_\\ast\\sim100\\, \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ through to classical dwarfs with $M_\\ast \\sim 5\\times10^6 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$, as well as haloes that remain dark to the present day. We explore two prescriptions for the high-redshift ($z>7$) Lyman-Werner background (LWB), differing in intensity and redshift evolution. Star formation begins early ($z\\gtrsim8$) in progenitors with $M_{\\mathrm{200c}}\\sim10^5$-$10^6 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$, where molecular hydrogen enables warm moderate-density gas to efficiently cool. The LWB strongly influences the $z=0$ halo occupation fraction, shifting the dark-to-luminous transition from $M_{\\mathrm{200c}}\\sim10^7 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ (weaker LWB) to $M_{\\mathrm{200c}}\\sim10^8 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ (stronger LWB). Galaxies with $M_\\ast\\gtrsim10^5 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ are mostly insensitive to the LWB choice, whereas lower mass systems respond strongly, producing markedly different stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relations. The weaker LWB yields a very shallow SMHM slope with nearly constant scatter, while the stronger LWB introduces a pronounced break at $M_{\\mathrm{200c}}\\sim10^9 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$, where haloes of similar mass host galaxies with $M_\\ast\\sim10^3$ to $10^5 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ or remain dark. Both models produce a minimum stellar mass floor at $M_\\ast\\sim10^3 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$, originating from galaxies that undergo a single burst of star formation at high redshift before self-quenching from their first supernovae.",

This makes it crucial to deeply understand the behaviour of our analysis pipelines. A counterintuitive feature of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) second data release is that restricting the dataset to the last 10.3 years (DR2new) increases the inferred GWB significance from $\\leq2\\sigma$ for the full 25-year dataset (DR2full) to $\\geq3.5\\sigma$. We investigate whether this behaviour indicates an anomaly or is a possible outcome of the pipeline. Using realistic, DR2-like simulations with varying timespans, we find that the first 10 years contribute little to the GWB evidence due to their limited frequency coverage. This produces substantial overlap between the HD S/N distributions of DR2full and DR2new. Random noise fluctuations therefore yield a higher GWB evidence in DR2new than in DR2full in $15\\%$ of cases. Furthermore, $5\\%$ of simulations match the HD S/N of the real data, indicating that the observed behaviour is consistent with being a $\\sim2\\sigma$ outcome due to noise fluctuations. Regardless of significance, DR2new simulations introduce biases in the GWB parameter estimation due to spectral leakage effects that are ignored in standard analyses and which flatten the inferred spectrum. Including leakage removes these biases, demonstrating the reliability of DR2new when the signal is properly modelled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that combining EPTA DR2full with long-baseline data from NANOGrav and PPTA, as well as low-frequency data from LOFAR and NenuFAR, significantly enhances GWB evidence and parameter accuracy. Finally, we examine the impact of the observation timespan and find that short-baseline datasets introduce strong amplitude biases and are ineffective at constraining the GWB.",

Domínguez Romero Accepted for publication in MNRAS, 7 pages, 6 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We reexamined the framework used to determine the dark matter mass of a subhalo using the gravitational effects of its passage upon the stellar halo of a host. In particular, we aim to include different density distribution functions for the perturber and a non homogeneous background due to the host's halo gravitational potential. We have used a sample of K giant and RRLyrae stars based on Gaia DR3 data and two different set of simulations, to test the new formalism. From our analysis, we found that the inclusion of a nonhomogeneous background improves substantially the estimation of the subhalo dark matter mass. The methodology is not sufficiently sensitive to discriminate between different density distribution functions for the perturber, however, in the case of the observational data, the inclussion of the cloud's circular velocity is a fundamental tool to complement the analysis. The results obtained including the host halo potential agree with the independent previous measurements or with the reported value for the subhalo dark matter mass in the simulations. These results show that it is possible to measure the mass of smaller subhalos through their gravitational wake, even for subhalos closer to their host, with distances lower than 30 kpc.",

Using five Milky Way-mass halos from the Aquarius simulations, we introduce an information-theoretic framework to quantify spatial-chemical correlations through the mutual information (MI) between angular position and metallicity. We divide stars in each halo into high- and low-metallicity populations based on their median metallicity and examine their metallicity distribution functions (MDFs), spatial anisotropies, and angular-metallicity couplings as a function of galactocentric radius. The MDFs exhibit remarkable diversity, ranging from single-peaked distributions dominated by one or two massive progenitors to broad or bimodal forms shaped by multiple accretion events, revealing the stochastic nature of halo assembly. The low-metallicity stars, primarily contributed by disrupted satellites, display higher spatial anisotropy and stronger angular clustering than their metal-rich counterparts. After removing bound satellites, anisotropy decreases significantly, yet high-metallicity stars remain marginally more anisotropic, reflecting the lingering debris of massive, centrally deposited progenitors. The mutual information between angular position and metallicity increases with radius before saturating in the outskirts, with the difference between the data and randomized controls confined mainly to the inner halo signifying residual spatial-chemical coupling driven by incomplete phase mixing. Our results demonstrate that information-theoretic diagnostics provide a powerful and intuitive way to quantify the chemical complexity of stellar halos and offer a promising route to compare simulations with forthcoming high-dimensional Galactic survey data.",

We find that sightline-to-sightline variations demand at least 25 independent sightlines to quantitatively recover the true signal. Once this condition is met, the intrinsic signal can be recovered even for a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution. The galaxy selection method does not affect the inferred GaLaCC and lightcone effects are only relevant for redshift windows $\\Delta z \\gtrsim 0.5$. We discuss the implications of these findings for previous theoretical studies. We elucidate explicitly for the first time the physical origin of the GaLaCC and demonstrate that this signal is collectively sourced by the ensemble of galaxies residing in overdense regions rather than individual objects. We show that GaLaCC measured for opaque sightlines shows a larger peak at smaller scales with respect to transparent lines of sight. We connect this to the evolution of the mean free path of ionizing photons, showing that GaLaCC peak position has a very similar evolution but on smaller scales, as it probes only the core of ionised regions. Finally, we discuss which ongoing surveys can be used to measure the GaLaCC and provide an initial analysis of future developments, including using galaxies as background sources. Our results outline a bright future for the GaLaCC as a tool to unveil the galaxy-IGM interplay during the first billion years of the Universe.",

      "abstract": "The dynamical and thermodynamic effects of turbulence for the cosmic baryonic fluid Yun Wang, Minxing Li, Ping He Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Both simulations and observations indicate that the so-called missing baryons reside in the intergalactic medium (IGM) known as the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). In this paper, we employ the IllustrisTNG50-1 simulation to demonstrate that turbulence in the cosmic baryonic fluid is crucial for correctly understanding both the spatial distribution and the physical origins of the missing baryons in the universe. First, we find that dynamical effects cause the gas to be detained in low-density and intermediate-density regions, resulting in high baryon fractions, while prevent the convergence of the gas in high-density regions, leading to low baryon fractions. Second, turbulent energy is converted into thermal energy, and the injection and dissipation of turbulent energy have essentially reached a balance from $z=1$ to $0$. This indicates that the cosmic fluid is in a steady state within this redshift range. Due to turbulent heating, as redshift decreases, an increasing amount of warm gas is heated and transitions into the WHIM, and some even into hot gas. We find that, compared with turbulence in the cosmic fluid, shocks are unimportant in intermediate-density regions and even negligible in high-density regions, both dynamically and thermodynamically. This finding not only provides the origin of WHIM in terms of both dynamics and thermodynamics, but also questions the traditional view of the shock heating and highlights the importance of turbulence in shaping the large-scale structure of the universe, particularly in the evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters. In addition to TNG50-1, we validated our key findings with TNG50-2, TNG100-1, WIGEON, and EAGLE simulations, demonstrating that resolution, box size, and subgrid-physics variations do not affect our main conclusions.",

Existing methods either model bias or restrict analyses to low-density regions, yet their sensitivity to bias remains poorly understood. We propose a novel method based on the wavelet scattering transform (WST) to distinguish LSS across cosmological models while mitigating tracer bias. Central to our approach are the WST $m$-mode ratios, $R^{\\rm wst}$, a new statistical measure, and a high-density apodization preprocessing that smoothly rescales extreme values. We use a reduced chi-square to assess the cosmological parameter constraints and find that $R^{\\rm wst}$, in the scale range $j \\in [3,7]$, achieves $\\chi^2_{\\nu, \\rm cos} \\approx 6$ for cosmology while maintaining $\\chi^2_{\\nu, \\rm bias} \\sim 1$--a regime unattained by other statistics. $R^{\\rm wst}$ thus provides robust cosmological sensitivity with effective bias mitigation for future surveys.",

We introduce CosmoGLINT (Cosmological Generative model for Line INtensity mapping with Transformer), a Transformer-based generative framework designed to create realistic galaxy populations from dark matter (DM)-only simulations. CosmoGLINT auto-regressively generates sequences of galaxy properties -- including star formation rate (SFR), distance to the halo centre, and radial and tangential velocities relative to the halo -- conditioned on halo mass. Trained on the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamic simulation, the model reproduces key statistical properties of the original data, including the voxel intensity distribution and the power spectrum both in real and redshift space. It can efficiently generate a number of different realisations of the designated galaxy populations, enabling the creation of mock LIM/redshift survey catalogues from large halo catalogues produced by fast DM-only simulations. We show that our model trained at multiple redshifts can be applied to DM halo lightcone data to generate a realistic mock galaxy lightcone with incorporating the redshift evolution of the galaxy population. The mock catalogues can be readily used to derive statistical quantities and to develop data analysis pipelines for ongoing and future wide-field surveys.",

However, confusion with bright foregrounds is a major challenge for current-era pathfinder LIM experiments. Cross-correlation with cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing is a promising avenue to enable the first LIM detections at high redshifts, a pristine probe of fundamental physics but sparsely populated by faint galaxies, and to further probe the connection between matter and spectral line emission, expanding our understanding of galaxies and the IGM. Previous works have suggested that this direct correlation between LIM and CMB lensing is effectively impossible because smoothly varying modes in the intensity map are lost to bright foregrounds. In this work, we analytically revisit the direct correlation of foreground-filtered line intensity mapping with CMB lensing, highlighting lightcone evolution's previously neglected yet unavoidable and crucial effects. Indeed, the growth of structure and evolution of line emission along the lightcone breaks statistical translational invariance and thus induces mode coupling, even in linear theory, which enables the recovery of the smoothly varying modes lost to bright foregrounds. We compute the effects of these lightcone evolution-induced mode couplings on the LIMxCMB lensing cross-spectrum detectability, predicting that future wider-sky versions of COMAP and CCAT will be able to precisely measure this cross-correlation. Although we focus on the direct correlation of LIM with CMB lensing in this paper, our arguments generalize to the direct correlation of LIM with any projected field.",

The analyses are performed on both macro- and micro-filaments, each characterized by their length, thickness, and contrast in mass density. In addition to total sample comparisons, two subcategories of micro-filaments, GG (linking galaxy groups) and CC (linking galaxy clusters), are introduced to further analyze discrepancies between the $\\Lambda$CDM model and observation. While $\\Lambda$CDM produces extended macro-filaments, such structures are largely absent in SDSS, and where present, they exhibit higher densities than their simulated counterparts. Micro-filaments also show notable density discrepancies: at fixed length and thickness, observational filaments are significantly denser than those in the simulation. Employing radial density profiles reveal that micro-filaments in the $\\Lambda$CDM simulation exhibit higher contrasts in mass density relative to the background compared to their observational counterparts. Notably, CC type micro-filaments displayed enhanced density contrasts over GG types in the simulation, while observational data showed the opposite trend. Furthermore, SDSS galaxies in both GG and CC micro-filaments exhibit lower specific star formation rates (sSFR) and older stellar populations, while TNG300-1 micro-filaments host more actively star-forming galaxies within the intermediate stellar mass range. These results reveal persistent discrepancies between observational data and the $\\Lambda$CDM reconstruction of cosmic filaments, pointing to possible tensions in our current understanding of large-scale structures and their environmental effects on galaxy evolution.",

However, bright foreground contamination and the nature of radio interferometry create significant challenges, making it difficult to access rich cosmological information from the Fourier modes that lie within the \"foreground wedge\". In this work, we introduce two approaches aiming to reconstruct the full 21-cm density field, including the missing modes in the wedge: (a) a field-level inference under an effective field theory (EFT) framework; (b) a diffusion-based deep generative model trained on simulations. Under the EFT framework, we implement a fully differentiable forward model that maps the initial conditions of matter fluctuations to the observed, foreground-filtered 21-cm maps. This enables a gradient-based sampler to simultaneously sample the initial conditions and bias parameters, allowing a physically motivated mode reconstruction. Alternatively, we apply a variational diffusion model to perform 21-cm density reconstruction at the map level. Our model is trained on semi-numerical simulations over a wide range of astrophysical parameters. Our results from both approaches should provide improved cosmological constraints from the field level and also enable cross-correlation between experiments that have little or no overlapping modes.",

The European Physical Journal C (2025) 85:1350 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The $\\Lambda$CDM cosmolgical model has long been regarded as highly successful in accurately describing a wide range of astronomical observations. However, numerous observational findings have also provided hints of discrepancies from the predictions of the $\\Lambda$CDM framework. We explore a phenomenological model that quantifies the deviation of the Hubble expansion rate from the standard scenario, which is expressed as $H^{2}(z) = H^{2}_{\\rm \\Lambda CDM}(\\Omega_m, z)[1+\\delta(z)]$. We consider three distinct forms for the deviation parameter $\\delta(z)$: in model I, $\\delta(z)=\\delta_c$; in model II, $\\delta(z)=\\delta_{c}z/(1+z)$, and in model III, $\\delta(z)=\\delta_{c}{\\rm ln}(1+z)$. Here, $\\delta_c$ represents a constant value. We utilize a comprehensive set of observational data to constrain the models. Our results show that for most combined datasets, $\\delta_c$ tends to take on negative values for models I and II, while consistently taking positive values in model III. Furthermore, we find that both models I and II remain consistent with the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model across all datasets examined. In contrast, model III exhibits a significant deviation from the $\\Lambda$CDM model, exceeding $2\\sigma$ for the full combined datastes. The AIC indicates that models I and II are consistent with the $\\Lambda$CDM model, whereas model III is preferred over the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model, with the $\\Lambda$CDM model being disfavored for the combined datasets DESI BAO + CMB + CC + DESY5.

Paradoxically, it has allowed one to explain and reproduce all halo properties found in cosmological simulations except their rotation, which remains to be understood. With the present two Papers we remedy this anomaly. In Paper I we derived the angular momentum (AM) of protohalos centered on triaxial peaks of suited scale, taking into account that, to leading order, their density profile is smooth and homogeneous. Here we use that result to derive the AM of these objects, accounting for the fact that their actual density profile is slightly outward decreasing and lumpy so that they do not collapse monolithically at once, but progressively from inside out, undergoing mergers during the process. By monitoring in detail their resulting mass and AM growth, we characterize the spin distribution of final halos and the precise mass and radial distribution of their inner mean specific AM. The results obtained explain and reproduce the rotational properties of simulated halos.",

This physical scenario calls for two additional parameters with respect to the {\\Lambda}CDM model, one of which is the equation of state parameter of the created dark energy. The model is constrained by the requirement that its deceleration parameter coincides with the one predicted by the {\\Lambda}CDM model. Then, we construct the effective running Hubble constant, a theoretical function that corresponds to the ratio of the Hubble parameter in our model to the {\\Lambda}CDM expansion rate. The model's theoretical predictions for the effective running Hubble constant are compared with the binned data of the Supernovae Ia Master Sample. The comparison is performed by a MCMC procedure for each bin, with three parameters left free to vary, while the particle creation rate is taken from a grid of values, each of which is fixed in the given MCMC run. The most important result emerging from this analysis is that the created dark energy constituent corresponds to an equation of state parameter with phantom character. Only if particle creation is removed do the dark energy constituents acquire a quintessence character. No matter the intrinsic nature of the constituents, their effective z-dependent equation of state parameter is, both with and without considering particle creation, entirely of phantom nature across the considered redshift range.",

The origin of such states has been a persistent mystery, particularly because the physics of collisionless relaxation has remained poorly understood. To solve this long-standing problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation that describes the secular evolution of the mean coarse-grained distribution function $f_0$ of accreted matter in the fluctuating force field of a spherical isotropic halo. The diffusion coefficient not only depends on the fluctuation power spectrum but also on the evolving potential of the system, which reflects the self-consistency of the problem. Diffusive heating in the pre-assembled halo develops an $r^{-\\gamma}$ inner density cusp, accretion and relaxation in which develops an $r^{-\\beta}$ outer fall-off with $\\beta \\approx 5 - 2\\gamma$ in the quasi-steady state. Spherical collapse theory dictates that a quasi-steady outer halo must settle to $\\beta \\approx 3$, for which the mass enclosed within a shell barely changes with time. This implies that $\\gamma\\approx 1$, which is possible in the quasilinear framework only if (i) the pre-assembled halo harbors an $r^{-\\gamma_{\\mathrm{P}}}$ profile with $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{P}} \\gtrsim 0.5$, (ii) its fluctuations are correlated in time (red noise), and (iii) the initial value of $\\gamma$ is smaller than $1$, implying that the $r^{-1}$ cusp is a neutral equilibrium. We demonstrate for the first time how the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile emerges as a quasi-steady state of collisionless relaxation.",

Accepted by ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Gravitational waves (GWs) accompanied by electromagnetic (EM) counterparts provide a novel methodology to measure the Hubble constant ($H_0$), known as bright sirens. However, the rarity of such multi-messenger events limits the precision of the $H_0$ constraint. Recently, the newly-discovered nuclear transient, quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) show intriguing evidence of a stellar-mass companion captured by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme/intermediate mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI/IMRI), which is the most promising sources of the space-based GW detectors, such as LISA. Here, we model the secular orbital evolution of known QPE systems using two frameworks: a stripping scenario in which periodic mass transfer at periapsis drives the evolution; and an orbiter-disk collision scenario in which the companion interacts with a misaligned accretion disk, modulated by coupled orbiter-disk precession. For each framework, we assess detectability by LISA, together with the resulting constraints on $H_0$. Our principal findings are: (i) in the stripping scenario, no currently known QPE reaches detectability within a four-year LISA mission. (ii) in the orbiter-disk scenario, two sources-eRO-QPE2 and eRO-QPE4-are detectable with signal-to-noise ratios $\\simeq 8.5-28.8$ and constrain $H_0$ with fractional uncertainty of 6.7-14.9\\%. QPE systems remain uncertain on the decade-long secular evolution. Therefore, they motivate continued time-domain monitoring of QPE candidates.",

Accepted for publication in Astrophysical Journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The combination of the $z=0-13.5$ cosmic star formation history and active galactic nuclei (AGN) luminosity history as inferred by the James Webb Space Telescope is connected to the cosmic spectral energy distribution (CSED) to explore the sources of reionisation. We compute the redshift evolution of the corresponding cosmic ionising photon emissivity, the neutral fraction and the cosmic microwave background optical depth. We use the generative SED modelling code ProSpect to bracket the ionising emissivity between escape fractions of $f_{\\mathrm{esc}} = 1 - 100\\%$ for both the stars and AGN. Stars alone could have achieved reionisation by $z\\approx 6$ with $f_{\\mathrm{esc}} \\gtrsim 30\\%$ for solar metallicity ($Z=0.02$) stars or $f_{\\mathrm{esc}} \\gtrsim 10\\%$ for metal-poor ($Z=10^{-4}$) stars. On the other hand, AGN by themselves would have struggled to produce sufficiently many ionising photons even with $f_{\\mathrm{esc}} = 100\\%$. A hybrid model containing both stars and AGN is explored where we find best fit (median$\\pm 1\\sigma$) $f_{\\mathrm{esc}}=$ $12\\%$ ($14^{+9}_{-7}\\%$) for the stars and $f_{\\mathrm{esc}}=$ $63\\%$ ($60^{+28}_{-32}\\%$) for the AGN, maintained at all redshifts. In essence, the joint growth of stellar mass and supermassive black holes produces neither more nor fewer ionising photons than needed to reionise $\\gtrsim 99\\%$ of the intergalactic medium by $z\\approx 6$.",

Using hydrodynamical simulations, we show that the progenitors' baryonic binding energy, $|E_{\\rm bind}|$, critically controls the outcome. Repeated potential fluctuations, e.g., from bursty feedback, inject energy and reduce $|E_{\\rm bind}|$ by $\\approx 15\\%$, yielding fewer but substantially more massive DMDGs. By contrast, elastic self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) produces comparable cores without lowering $|E_{\\rm bind}|$, resulting in negligible effect. This differs from the other DMDG formation scenario, where SIDM-induced cores enhance dark matter tidal stripping while keeping baryons compact and resilient to tidal effects. The contrasting roles of SIDM help distinguish feedback-formed halo cores from those created by SIDM. Among 15 paired simulation runs, 13 show higher DMDG masses in the weakened-binding case, and about two thirds exhibit $>100\\%$ mass enhancements. The simulations also predict systematically lower gas fractions due to sustained post-collision star formation, yielding a clean observational signature. Upcoming wide-field imaging (CSST, LSST), HI surveys (FAST), and kinematic follow-up will be crucial to test this scenario.",

The default strategy is to reduce data after each daily observation and stack the resulting images. Although this approach is computationally efficient, it risks propagating systematic errors and significantly degrades the final data quality. However, storage and computation requirements for a traditional way to image the entire deep dataset together are prohibitively expensive. We present an alternative \\textit{uv}-grid stacking method and compare its scientific outcomes with both the traditional approach, which processes all data jointly and serves as the best-possible result, and the default image-stacking method. Our technique involves halting the standard imaging pipeline after the daily residual visibility grids are formed. These grids are then stacked and jointly deconvolved to combine many epochs of data. Using the traditional approach as a benchmark, we show that image-stacking recovers only 92\\% of the true {\\HI} flux. In contrast, our \\textit{uv}-grid stacking method recovers 99\\%, which is in excellent agreement with the traditional method within the noise limits. Furthermore, image-stacking introduces significant non-physical artefacts, such as negative bowls around strong sources, indicating poor deconvolution and a loss of physical information. Based on these findings, we intend to apply the \\textit{uv}-grid stacking to the Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO) survey on ASKAP and strongly recommend this or a similar approach for future radio astronomy facilities.",

      "abstract": "The impact of magnetic fields during tidal disruption events Simona Pacuraru, Clément Bonnerot, Martin E. Pessah Submitted to MNRAS, comments are welcome! High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) During a tidal disruption event (TDE) the stream debris inherits the magnetic field of the star. As the stream stretches, the magnetic field evolves and can eventually become dynamically important. We study this effect by means of magnetohydrodynamic simulations and a semi-analytic model of the disruption of a main-sequence star by a supermassive black hole. For stellar magnetic fields stronger than $\\sim 10^4\\,\\rm{G}$, magnetic pressure becomes important in a significant fraction of the mass of the stream, leading to a fast increase in its thickness, an effect that may impact its subsequent evolution. We find that this dynamical effect is associated with a phase of transverse equilibrium between magnetic and tidal forces, which causes the stream width to increase with distance to the black hole as $H \\propto R^{5/4}$. In the unbound tail, this fast expansion could enhance the radio emission produced by the interaction with the ambient medium, while in the returning stream, it may qualitatively affect the subsequent gas evolution, particularly the gas dynamics and radiative properties of shocks occurring after the stream's return to pericentre. By characterizing the magnetohydrodynamic properties of the stream from disruption to the first return to pericentre, this work provides physically motivated initial conditions for future studies of the later phases of TDEs, accounting for magnetic fields. This will ultimately shed light on the role of magnetic fields in enabling angular momentum transport in the ensuing accretion disk, thereby affecting observable signatures such as X-ray radiation and relativistic outflows.",

We connect several features of the gravitational wave signal from each model to its previously explored explosion dynamics. In particular, the greater accretion onto the PNS of the more compact model is evident in broad-band frequency features with larger amplitude gravitational wave strains and greater gravitational wave energy release when compared to the less compact model. Additionally, the faster contraction rate of the more compact model is reflected in the $\\sim$26% greater slope of the $g$-/$f$-mode feature (gfF) evolution of the gravitational wave signal.

In this paper, using a data-driven framework based on binned Gaussian processes, we characterize the joint distribution of BBH primary masses, mass ratios, and effective inspiral spins. We identify three distinct subpopulations in the GWTC-4 sample of observations and investigate their astrophysical origins. We find that only one of the three subpopulations exhibits the $35M_{\\odot}$ peak, which is characterized by a strong preference for equal mass systems and isotropic spin orientations. Our inferred distributions are consistent with a predominantly dynamical origin of this feature. By comparing with theoretical simulations, we further show that the subpopulation that exhibits the $35M_{\\sun}$ peak can exclusively comprise dynamically assembled systems in globular clusters, specifically if black hole birth spins are in the range~$(0.1-0.2)$, whereas the other two subpopulations require substantial contributions from alternative formation channels. We constrain the \\textit{lower bound} on the merger rate of BBHs in globular clusters to be $0.69^{+0.23}_{-0.33} \\rm{Gpc}^{-3}\\rm{yr}^{-1}$, which is consistent with theoretical predictions. We conclude that dynamical formation in globular clusters remains a strong candidate for the origin of this excess near $30-40M_{\\odot}$ and that more data and targeted parametric models are necessary to rigorously establish this interpretation.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) A newly born millisecond magnetar has been proposed as one possible central engine of some long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) with X-ray plateau. In this work, we used a universal correlation between initial spin period ($P_0$) and surface magnetic field ($B_p$) of newborn magnetar based on an LGRB sample in \\cite{Lan2025} to explore the propeller properties of accreting magnetar with $R/I$ evolutionary effects. We found that $B_p-P_0$ relation is approximately consistent with $B_p\\propto P_{\\rm eq}^{7/6}$. Here, $P_{\\rm eq}$ is equilibrium spin period in magnetic propeller model. The $B_p-P_0$ relation indicates that $P_0$ may not be true initial spin period of newborn magnetar, but had reached an equilibrium spin period via fallback accretion in propeller model. The magnetar accretion rate in our LGRBs is in range of $\\dot{M}\\sim10^{-5}-10^{-2} M_{\\odot} \\rm s^{-1}$ by incorporating $R/I$ evolutionary effects, and using the transition relation between gravitational mass $M_g$ and baryonic mass $M_b$ in different equation of states. Such accretion rates ensure that the accreting magnetars in our sample survive until reaching the equilibrium spin period, and the accretion rate is one order of magnitude lower compared to the statistical results in \\cite{Stratta2018} and \\cite{Linweili2020}, which used constant $R/I/M_g$ scenario. We suggested that adopting a constant $R/I/M_g$ scenario for modeling propeller regime in accreting magnetar results in a higher mass accretion rate, which may impair our understanding of the physical nature and its surroundings of accreting magnetar, and low-metallicity progenitors can provide enough material to satisfy the accretion requirements of newborn accreting magnetar in LGRBs.",

Giustini Proceedings of \"X-ray Quasi-Periodic Eruptions and Repeating Nuclear Transients\", 16-19 June 2025, ESAC, Madrid. Submitted to Astronomische Nachrichten High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) After six years of studies following the discovery of GSN069, a link is starting to appear between the elusive Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs) and other types of nuclear transients, among which are Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs). As such, observing strategies are adapting, with a current trend focusing on late-time X-ray follow-ups of (optical) TDEs. While these campaigns are so far proving quite successful, the inherent confirmation bias they introduce in our sample could lead the community to hasty, and perhaps erroneous, conclusions. It is thus important to still pursue the search for nuclear transients in other, more agnostic directions. In this work, we focus on the observational aspects of our field, and lay out two different methods that can be deployed in order to reveal new QPE sources. These complementary methods enable the detection of long-term ($\\sim$years) and short term ($\\sim$minutes) transient events, that would have otherwise been missed by the standard detection pipelines. Both of these methods can be used either for data mining in the 25 years worth of XMM-Newton archive, or to trigger real-time follow-ups upon a more recent discovery.",

Wu, X. L. Xia 35 pages, 7 figures and 3 tables, accepted by ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We analyze a sample of\\textit{ Swift} gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with extended emissions in $\\gamma$-rays and/or X-ray plateaus that may be driven by magnetars. Multi-wavelength data and multi-standards have been adopted to investigate the issue jointly. First, we find that GRBs with both extended emission and X-ray plateau satisfy a three-parameter relation between the luminosity and the end time of X-ray plateaus and the $\\gamma$-ray isotropic energy as $L_X\\varpropto T_a^{-1.13}E_{\\gamma,iso}^{0.74}$, which is consistent with that of normal GRBs. Second, we distinguish these GRBs in the plane of magnetic field versus period of neutron star and find that almost all GRBs but GRB 211024B have reasonable periods and majority of them could be powered by magnetars. Third, we standardize the X-ray afterglows with distinct characteristics and find that the standard X-ray light curves with/without plateaus are significantly different. The standardized X-ray plateaus are similar to the mean temporal profile of magnetars. Fourth, it is verified with a K-S test that all types of GRBs except short ones have the similar distributions of redshift and isotropic energy in the observer/rest frame. GRBs with internal plateaus are significantly different from those of normal long GRBs and GRBs with external plateaus and/or extended emissions. Interestingly, the isotropic energy distributions of GRBs with internal and external plateaus are identical with those of short and long GRBs, respectively. Overall, our study can bring solid evidence that the fascinating magnetars could have multi-formation channels to account for not only short but also long GRBs with either internal or external X-ray plateaus as well.",

Submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We study the superfluid vortex motion in the neutron star inner crust through direct three-dimensional simulations of the coupled dynamics of the vortex and the nuclear lattice. We demonstrate the pinning of an initially moving vortex to the lattice through excitation of lattice vibrations, and show that the efficiency of this process is higher for attractive than for repulsive nucleus-vortex interactions. We explore the unpinning of a vortex under the action of the applied Magnus force, and find that it is influenced by multiple parameters, including the sign of the pinning force, the lattice orientation, composition, temperature, and the energy of pinning to individual nucleus. In lattices with multiple grains, the unpinning transition is triggered inside the grains with weaker pinning, propagates along the vortex (mediated by the excited Kelvin waves) and crosses into grains with stronger pinning. This is likely to effectively decrease the critical force at which vortices unpin and to produce extended regions of unpinned vorticity. Shearing of the crust lattice (e.g., by a starquake) initiates the unpinning of the vortices that are crossing the slip plane. A close encounter of an unpinned vortex with a pinned vortex would cause the latter to unpin, perhaps initiating an unpinning avalanche of many vortices.",

      "abstract": "Blazar classification from multi-wavelength data using Deep Learning Saqlain Afroz, Titir Mukherjee, Raj Prince High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The launch of the Fermi-LAT telescope has revolutionized gamma-ray astronomy by detecting over 7,000 gamma-ray emitting objects. A major fraction of the objects are blazars of known type, and a similar fraction of objects were classified as blazars of uncertain types (BCUs). Apart from that, some of the objects were found to be unassociated with any other classes, and no information is available in other wavebands. These types of objects are classified as unassociated objects in the Fermi catalog. To classify the unassociated objects into known categories and BCUs into a known type of blazar, numerous efforts have been made using the machine learning approach. The ideal way of classification would be to have multi-wavelength temporal and spectral information, which is nearly impossible to have for this number of objects in the near future. In this paper, we focus on classifying BCUs into other types of blazars, such as FSRQs and BL Lacs. For this purpose, we have developed for the first time a deep feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify them, using multi-wavelength data. The complete understanding of blazars can only be known through multi-wavelength observation, and hence, we begin with four input parameters that cover broadband information (radio, optical, X-ray fluxes, and redshift) to train the neural network, and then extend the framework by including additional parameters to examine their impact on the outcome.",

In this work, we present a unified search strategy for sub-saturated Fermi-ball DM. We first revisit and significantly update astrophysical constraints from compact objects, utilizing rigorous expressions and additional white dwarf data related to ignition and subsequent supernovae. Crucially, we then explore novel signatures of Fermi-balls in future gravitational wave experiments like LISA and TianQin, performing detailed signal-to-noise ratio and Fisher matrix analyses. By combining these updated white dwarf/neutron star limits with the projected gravitational wave sensitivities, we derive the most comprehensive constraints on Fermi-ball parameter space to date, demonstrating the power of multi-messenger approaches for probing macroscopic DM.",

Karen Yang 16 pages, 11 figures, submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is believed to play a significant role in suppressing cooling flows in cool-core (CC) clusters. Turbulence in the intracluster medium (ICM), which may be induced by AGN activity or pre-existing motions, has been proposed as a potential heating mechanism based on analysis of Chandra X-ray surface brightness fluctuations. However, subsequent simulation results have found the subdominant role of turbulence in heating the ICM. To investigate this discrepancy, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a Perseus-like cluster including both AGN feedback and pre-existing turbulence, which is stirred to the observationally constrained level in the Perseus cluster. Our results indicate that, although the velocity field is dominated by the pre-existing turbulence, AGN heating through bubbles and shocks remains significant. More importantly, analysis of the velocity structure function and the energy power spectrum shows that the turbulent heating rate is smaller than the radiative cooling rate, especially in the cluster core. Our results offer insights relevant for recent XRISM observations and indicate that turbulent heating alone cannot offset radiative cooling in CC clusters.",

      "abstract": "Synchrotron Self-Compton Model of TeV Afterglows in Gamma-Ray Bursts Edilberto Aguilar-Ruiz, Ramandeep Gill, Paz Beniamini, Jonathan Granot High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The detection of a very-high-energy TeV spectral component in the afterglow emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has opened a new probe into the energetics of ultra-relativistic blast waves and the nature of the circumburst environment in which they propagate. The afterglow emission is well understood as the synchrotron radiation from the shock-accelerated electrons in the medium swept up by the blast wave. The same distribution of electrons also inverse-Compton upscatters the softer synchrotron photons to produce the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) TeV emission. Accurate modeling of this component generally requires a computationally expensive numerical treatment, which makes it impractical when fitting to observations using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Simpler analytical formalisms are often limited to broken power-law solutions and some predict an artificially high Compton-Y parameter. Here we present a semi-analytic framework for a spherical blast wave that accounts for adiabatic cooling and expansion, photon escape, and equal-arrival-time-surface integration, in addition to Klein-Nishina effects. Our treatment produces the broadband afterglow spectrum and its temporal evolution at par with results obtained from more sophisticated kinetic calculations. We fit our model to the afterglow observations of the TeV bright GRB\\,190114C using MCMC, and find an energetic blast wave with kinetic energy $E_{k, \\rm iso} = 9.1^{+7.41}_{-3.13} \\times 10^{54} \\, \\rm erg$ propagating inside a radially stratified external medium with number density $n(r)\\propto r^{-k}$ and $k=1.67^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$. A shallower external medium density profile ($k<2$) departs from the canonical approximation of a steady wind ($k=2$) from the progenitor star and may indicate a non-steady wind or a transition to an interstellar medium.",

Accepted in MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), among the most compelling astrophysical phenomena, are potential candidates for exploring the evolution of energy distribution among magnetic fields and particles through multiwavelength observations. The fraction of energy transferred between particles and the magnetic field is governed by microphysical parameters, typically assumed to be constant during relativistic shocks but may in fact vary with time. In this work, we derive the light curves and closure relations (CRs) of the synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) process from the external reverse shock (RS) with variations of microphysical parameters in a homogeneous and stellar-wind medium. We consider the evolution of the RS in the thick- and thin-shell regimes. We demonstrate that, depending on the microphysical parameters, this process can mimic plateau phases and produce temporal decay indices steeper than those predicted by high-latitude emission alone. The current model is employed to examine the evolution of the spectral and temporal indices of GRBs reported in the Second Fermi-LAT Gamma-ray Burst Catalog (2FLGC) and bursts detected at very high energies, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations.",

May Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present spectroscopic and photometric observations of supernova (SN) 2021ukt, a peculiar short-plateau object that was originally identified as a Type IIn SN and later underwent an unprecedented transition to a Type Ib (possibly Type IIb) SN. The early-time light curves of SN 2021ukt exhibit a ~25 day plateau. Such a short phase of hydrogen recombination suggests a rather thin H-rich outer envelope of the progenitor star. The relatively narrow Balmer emission lines in spectra of SN 2021ukt during the first week indicate the interaction between the expanding ejecta and the immediate circumstellar material (CSM). This H{\\alpha} line is observed throughout its helium-rich ejecta-dominated phase and nebular phase, suggesting persistent interaction with a radially extended CSM profile. We explore the synthetic light-curve model among grids of parameters generated by MESA+STELLA. We also compare the spectrophotometric evolution of SN 2021ukt with several well-sampled supernovae that exhibit a short plateau and persistent ejecta-CSM interaction. An estimate of the progenitor mass of SN 2021ukt is made based on the flux ratio between [Ca II] {\\lambda}{\\lambda} 7291, 7324 and [O I] {\\lambda}{\\lambda} 6300, 6364 during its nebular phase. Our analysis suggests that the progenitor star of SN 2021ukt has a zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass of about 12 solar masses, a mass of radioactive nickel-56 synthesized in the SN ejecta of about 0.04 solar masses, and a mass of the H-rich envelope of about 0.5 solar masses. This study adds to the growing sample of transitional supernovae, reinforcing evidence for a continuum of underrepresented progenitors whose evolutionary pathways lie between those of standard SN models.",

Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) impact many areas of astrophysics, including compact object formation and gravitational waves, but many uncertainties remain in our understanding of the evolution of their progenitors. We use the binary population synthesis code COSMIC to simulate populations of CCSNe across a wide range of metallicities and binary evolution assumptions. Our models vary the prescriptions for mass transfer stability, common envelope ejection efficiency, natal kick strength, and remnant mass-limited explodability to assess their impact on the resulting population of CCSNe. We find that reproducing the observed Type I to Type II rate requires either low common envelope efficiency or modified prescriptions for common envelope survival, highlighting the importance of stellar mergers in shaping the CCSN population. We further classify our synthetic CCSNe into subtypes and present their relative abundances using several different sets of classification criteria, highlighting the large uncertainties that persist in mapping progenitor properties to spectral classes. Finally, we present delay time distributions (DTDs) for our overall populations, separated into Type I and II, and into the full set of observed subtypes. Our DTDs show that models reproducing the observed Type I to Type II rate produce a larger fraction of late CCSNe than is expected under standard assumptions.",

Our timing analysis reveals a >8$\\sigma$ significant modulation at 3.6 $\\pm$ 0.5 hours, likely representing the orbital period. Long-term ASAS-SN monitoring confirms the source as a VY Sculptoris-type nova-like system, while short-timescale X-ray and ultraviolet variability, down to a few minutes, suggests a possible underlying magnetic white dwarf. Two additional significant X-ray modulations at 43 $\\pm$ 1 min and 36.0 $\\pm$ 0.7 min tentatively point to the spin period of an intermediate polar. The best-fit XMM-Newton energy spectra reveal a multi-temperature thermal plasma ($kT$ = 0.23, 0.94, and 5.2 keV), while the SRG/eROSITA spectra are consistent with a single-temperature thermal plasma of a few keV. We estimate unabsorbed X-ray luminosities of $\\gtrsim$$10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (0.2-12 keV). Broadband spectral energy distribution modelling, from near-ultraviolet to infrared, indicates a disc-dominated system consistent with a nova-like classification.

The resulting local energy transfer (a few keV per ~10 MeV neutrino) accumulates across the ~100 km stalled-shock layer, yielding a total heating of 10^49-10^50 erg, comparable within an order of magnitude to the increment required to trigger shock revival in current multidimensional simulations. This indicates that the long-standing failure of isoenergetic transport schemes to revive the shock originates from their neglect of recoil kinematics. Because the momentum exchange in each scattering is tiny, the emergent neutrino spectra and lepton-number balance remain essentially unchanged.

      "abstract": "Measurement of Milli-Charged Particles with a running electromagnetic coupling constant at IceCube Ye Xu High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) It is postulated that heavy dark matter $\\phi$ with a mass on the order of TeV, once captured by the Earth, can decay into relativistic milli-charged particles (MCPs). These MCPs are potentially detectable at the IceCube neutrino telescope. In this study, MCPs are modeled within the massless hidden photon framework, where they interact with nuclei via a running electromagnetic coupling constant, thereby enabling the prediction of their expected event rates and fluxes at IceCube. The expected number of background neutrino events at IceCube has also been evaluated. Under the assumption that no signal events are observed over a 10-year period at IceCube, upper limits on the MCP flux have been derived at the 90\\% confidence level. The results suggest that MCPs originating from the Earth's core could be directly detected at IceCube at energies around $\\mathcal{O}(1\\ \\text{TeV})$ for a fractional charge-squared range of $5.65\\times10^{-5} \\lesssim \\epsilon^2 \\lesssim 1.295\\times10^{-3}$.

Sarkar 20 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables. Submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a long-term broad-band temporal and spectral study of a TeV BL Lac source TXS 0518+211 by analyzing nearly 16 years (MJD 54682 -- 60670) of simultaneous optical, UV and X-ray light curves from Swift-XRT/UVOT and gamma-ray light curves from Fermi-LAT. Based on the availability of simultaneous multi-wavelength data and considering flux level as the depiction of AGN-jet activity we identified 11 epochs (named as Epoch-A to Epoch-K) and investigated temporal as well as spectral variability during these epochs to understand the emission properties in this source. The fractional variability analysis reveals that, in all epochs, X-ray light curve exhibits relatively high degree of variability in compared to the optical, UV and gamma-ray light curves. The flux-flux plots among different bands, in general, show weak to moderate correlation with Spearman correlation coefficient ranging from 0.29 to 0.58. Notably, during Epoch-I, we detect a possible orphan flare exhibiting increase in the X-ray flux level ($\\sim$ 2.4 times of the total average flux) but with no corresponding counterpart seen in the optical, UV bands. In contrast, during Epoch-K, we detect a significant decrease in the X-ray flux but no corresponding decrease in optical, UV and gamma-ray bands. Overall, our study reveals several changes in the flux states and complex nature of jet dominated emission processes. In all the epochs, two-zone leptonic model provides a better description of the broad-band emission in this TeV BL Lac source.",

In this work, we leverage and refine a Monte-Carlo photon and electron-positron (e$^\\pm$) pair tracking code in the AGN environment of the radio galaxy NGC 1275. In the code, we consider the isotropic broad-line region (BLR) and anisotropic Shakura-Sunyaev (SS) accretion disk radiation fields, with mild magnetic fields in the AGN environment. We find that cascade $\\gamma$-rays from inverse-Compton scattering by relativistic e$^\\pm$ pairs of these external radiation fields can explain the Fermi Large Area Telescope's (LAT) and Major Atmospheric Cherenkov Experiment's observations from the radio galaxy NGC 1275.

The source can be a massive star (with or without disc) with a HII region or a G-type T Tauri star with a photo-evaporating disc, embedded in a molecular envelope. We obtained a map of the OI line at 63 micron with 6\" angular resolution and employed archival data of the CII 158 micron line (14\" resolution), using the upGREAT heterodyne receiver aboard SOFIA. We also collected IRAM 30m CO data at 1mm (11\" resolution). All the lines were detected across the whole object. The peak integrated OI emission of ~5 K km/s is located ~10\" west of an embedded YSO. The OI and CII data near the source show bulk emission at ~11 km/s and a line wing at ~13 km/s, while the 12CO 2-1 data reveal additional blue-shifted high-velocity emission. The KOSMA-tau PDR model can explain the emissions in the tail with a low external UV field (<350 Go, mostly consistent with our UV field estimates), but not at the location of the YSO. There, the high line intensities and increased line widths for all lines and a possible bipolar CO outflow suggest the presence of a protostellar disc. However, the existence of a thermal HII region, revealed by combining existing and new radio continuum data, points towards a massive star - and not a T Tauri-type one. We derived molecular and atomic gas masses of ~20 Msun and a few Msun, respectively. The photo-evaporation (only considering external illumination) lifetime of 1.6x10^5 yrs is shorter than the free-fall lifetime of 5.2x10^5 yrs; thus, we find that proplyd #7 might not have had the time to produce many more stars.",

Multiple Spiral Mode Formation via Swing Amplification SungWon Kwak, Ivan Minchev, Christoph Pfrommer, Matthias Steinmetz, Sukyoung K. Yi 20 pages, 12 figures, Submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate the formation of multiple spiral modes in Milky Way-like disk-halo systems without explicitly exciting perturbations. We explore how numerical resolution, the level of local disk stability, and the presence of a live halo influence both the initial appearance and the subsequent evolution of these modes. To characterize spiral structure, we compute Fourier amplitudes for modes $m=1$-$6$. In marginally unstable, lower-resolution disks ($N_\\star=5\\times10^6$, $N_{\\rm DM}=1.14\\times10^7$), faint features appear within the first $0.5$ Gyr due to numerical noise, in contrast to high-resolution models where perturbations emerge later. Across all sufficiently resolved, live-halo models with $m_{\\rm DM}/m_\\star \\le 10$, the spirals exhibit a cascading sequence in both mode number and radius: higher-$m$ modes form and decay first, followed by the delayed emergence of lower-$m$ modes, with an inward drift of the activity's epicenter. This behavior reflects a combination of local swing amplification, which explains the initial growth of short-wavelength modes, and interference between coexisting long-lived spiral modes, which accounts for the recurrent short-timescale amplitude modulations. In contrast, models with a fixed halo potential or coarse halo resolution ($N_{\\rm DM}=1.14\\times10^6$ and $m_{\\rm DM}/m_\\star=100$) show strong early spirals but lack this coherent cascading behavior, owing to excessive shot noise and insufficient halo responsiveness. The $m=3$ mode plays a transitional role, marking the onset of angular-momentum transport in the inner disk that precedes bar formation, a process absent in fixed-potential models. Our results show that a live halo with appropriate mass resolution provides the gravitational response needed to sustain and regenerate multi-mode spiral structure, even though the total angular-momentum exchange remains small.",

Menten, Katharina Immer, Ashley T. Barnes Accepted for publication in A&A (15 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Despite being only the 19th most abundant element in the interstellar medium, chlorine's reactivity and volatility give rise to a unique interstellar chemistry, favouring the formation of several chlorine-bearing hydrides. Further, the $^{35}\\text{Cl}/ ^{37}$Cl ratio probes nucleosynthesis across the Galaxy. Yet, studies of Cl-bearing molecules have remained limited to a few sightlines due to observational challenges. We systematically investigated the Galactic distribution of HCl and the [H$^{35}$Cl]/[H$^{37}$Cl] ratio in high-mass star-forming regions. As a probe of a region's nucleosynthesis history, this ratio may constrain predictions of Galactic chemical evolution models. We observed the ground-state $J=1$$-$0 lines of H$^{35}$Cl and H$^{37}$Cl toward 28 high-mass star-forming regions with SEPIA660 on APEX, more than doubling the number of known HCl detections and revealing with XCLASS models emission from both cores and outflows. H$^{35}$Cl was detected in all sources, H$^{37}$Cl in all but two, with spectral line profiles ranging from those with only emission to complex emission-absorption mixtures. We find column densities of the order of $10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ for H$^{35}$Cl and isotopic ratios between $1.6$ and $3.5$ in emission-only sources. The derived [H$^{35}$Cl]/[H$^{37}$Cl] aligns with Galactic chemical evolution models and shows no trend with Galactocentric radius. However, local variations may reflect recent nucleosynthesis. Overall, the results suggest that most Galactic chlorine was synthesized during epochs of lower average metallicity in the Galaxy. Notably, we detect H$^{35}$Cl emission arising from outflows - particularly explosive ones - hinting at its presence in a broader range of environments. The present single-dish observations cannot reveal the origin of HCl in outflows; necessitating interferometric follow-up observations.",

Chiang 21 pages, 13 figures, submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Cold, dense streams of gas are predicted to penetrate deeply into massive halos (> 10^12 Msun) at cosmic noon (z=4-2), fueling galaxies to sustain high star formation rates. We investigate the prevalence of such cold streams in IllustrisTNG-50 over the range z=4-0, using a novel algorithm to automatically detect cold streams in simulated halos. We qualitatively and quantitatively characterize the geometric and physical properties of the detected streams over cosmic time. We find that cold streams are ubiquitous in massive halos at cosmic noon, occurring in more than 80 percent of such systems down to z=1, before becoming rare by z=0. At their peak prevalence (z=2-1), streams are often found in roughly co-planar, three-stream configurations. These streams generally exhibit a dense and cool core, surrounded by a diffuse and warmer envelope. However, we find that in IllustrisTNG-50, these streams typically disrupt in the outer halo and do not penetrate efficiently to the central galaxy, with the total mass inflow from streams peaking at z=2. Our results underscore the importance of cold streams in fueling galaxies at early times, but they highlight the need for higher-resolution simulations to fully capture their survival and impact at later epochs. Future cosmological zoom-in simulations, with better resolution in the CGM, will be essential to resolve turbulent mixing layers and feedback-inflow interactions that determine whether cold streams can reach the galactic disk.",

LRD sample and measurements are publicly available at this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We use the DAWN JWST Archive to construct and characterise a sample of 116 little red dots (LRDs) across 2.3<z<9.3, selecting all sources with v-shaped UV-optical continua from NIRSpec/PRISM spectra and compact morphologies in NIRCam/F444W imaging. We show that LRD continuum spectra are ubiquitously well described by modified blackbodies across ~$0.4-1.0\\mu$m, with typical T~5000K or $\\lambda_{peak}$~$0.65\\mu$m across 2 dex in luminosity, and a tail toward T~2000K. LRDs therefore trace a locus in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram that is directly analogous to stars on the Hayashi track, strongly supporting the picture that LRDs are AGN embedded in thermalised dense gas envelopes in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium. Hotter LRDs with $\\lambda_{peak}<0.65\\mu$m typically have strong Balmer breaks, redder UV slopes and high optical luminosities; other LRDs show weak or no Balmer breaks, and wide variety in $\\beta_{UV}$ and $L_{5100}$. Crucially, we demonstrate that the UV-optical continuum shapes and luminosities are strongly linked to the $H\\alpha,\\ H\\beta$, [OIII] and OI line properties. There is a tight linear relation between the H$\\alpha$ and optical continuum luminosities, as well as H$\\alpha$ and OI$_{8446}$, indicating that Balmer, OI and optical emission must primarily be powered by the same source. The Balmer decrement increases strongly toward higher $L_{H\\alpha}$, $L_{5100}$ and Balmer break strength, providing key evidence for luminosity-dependent effects of collisional (de-)excitation and resonant scattering in the gaseous envelopes. In contrast, we show that [OIII] emission likely originates from star-forming host galaxies, and that its strong correlation with Balmer break strength arises naturally from variation in the AGN-to-host ratio. Our work presents an empirical description of the nature and structure of LRDs, defining a new benchmark for ongoing LRD model developments.",

Zaragoza-Cardiel Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present the value-added catalogue JOLINES (J-PAS optical line intensities for nebular emission galaxies), which provides emission-line fluxes in galaxies at from the spectrophotometric catalogues of miniJPAS, J-NEP and the J-PAS early data release (EDR). This catalogue will be updated with future data releases, offering a growing resource for the study of emission-line galaxies. To obtain reliable emission-line fluxes from narrow-band photometry, we employed spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using CIGALE, a robust tool that reconstructs the continuum emission and ensures accurate flux measurements. This method effectively mitigates uncertainties associated with direct continuum subtraction techniques, and systematics such as absorption components in the emission lines. We validate our approach using simulated observations of galaxy spectra with added noise, testing the method's performance across different equivalent width (EW) regimes and emission-line strengths. Additionally, we compare the recovered emission-line fluxes with spectroscopic measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our results show a tight correlation between photometric and spectroscopic fluxes, particularly for bright emission lines, with a typical dispersion of $\\sim$0.3 dex. Reliable fluxes are obtained for emission lines with EW $\\gtrsim20\\, \\rm{\\mathring{A}}$, in agreement with previous empirical studies. The current catalogue comprises approximately 13,900 sources with reliable flux measurements in the H$\\alpha$+[NII] complex and 7,200 in [OIII]$\\lambda 5007$, ensuring statistically robust samples for the brightest optical emission lines. This resource will be expanded in future J-PAS releases, facilitating large-scale studies of star formation, AGN activity, and galaxy evolution.",

To prove the capabilities of mapping and spectral scans with the B4R on the LMT, commissioning observations were conducted employing the on-the-fly mapping technique toward Orion-KL/OMC-1, which covers a map size of 5$'\\times$5$'$. These mapping observations were performed with two frequency settings providing 10 GHz in total (131.4-133.9 GHz and 145.1-147.6 GHz; 136.2-138.7 GHz and 149.9-152.4 GHz) with a frequency resolution of 76.293 kHz. We conducted spectral line identification analysis for the hot core and compact ridge regions in the Orion-KL with a beam size of 11-12$''$. We detected nearly 400 emission lines and identified two recombination lines and 29 molecular species, including isotopologues, deuterated molecules, and vibrational excited states, despite the short integration time. These results are consistent with those of previous studies. The 29 molecular species include nitrogen (N)-bearing complex organic molecules (COMs) and oxygen (O)-bearing COMs. To demonstrate the capability of the B4R in astrochemistry, we conducted detailed analyses of column densities, rotational temperatures, and relative abundances with respect to H$_2$ on two representative COMs, N-bearing C$_2$H$_5$CN and O-bearing CH$_3$OCHO in the central 40$''\\times$40$''$ area of the map. The wide bandwidth of 10 GHz enabled the use of 8 and 34 emission lines, respectively. The spatial differences in the physical and chemical properties between these molecules were derived at a spatial resolution of $\\sim$12$''$. The B4R on the LMT was successfully demonstrated to be powerful for mapping and spectral scans and to have high potential for the study of interstellar chemistry.",

      "abstract": "The relations between dust properties and galaxy global / integrated quantities in the nearby Universe Bogdan A. Pastrav 11 pages, 5 figures, submitted to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Results of a case study of a sample of low-redshift galaxies are presented, to determine dust temperatures and emissivity indices through a less time-consuming method, and to connect both global and integrated galaxy properties with those of dust, ISM and star-formation. Dust temperatures ($T_{d}$) are determined based on the corresponding galaxy dust masses, independently calculated in our previous work, through a self-consistent method, without the need to actually perform a complete spectral energy distribution (SED) fit of the cold dust emission fluxes. The range and average dust temperatures are found to be consistent within errors with values from other studies. Simultaneously, the dust emissivity indices ($\\beta_{d}$) are determined, and their evolution with temperature quantified, with the $T_{d}$ anti-correlation still being present. It is investigated whether $\\beta_{d}$ can be predicted from other relation or if it scales with other integrated dust / ISM or galaxy property, which could be used as a proxy. In this respect, new and established relations between $T_{d}$, $\\beta_{d}$, the dust surface density and global / integrated galaxy and star-formation related quantities are presented and analysed. We find that SFR, sSFR or $\\Sigma_{SFR}$ are inconclusive traces of the dust temperature. We also find that the extent of dust emission distribution is slightly lower on average, but comparable with the optical stellar continuum emission one. The results and conclusions can be relevant for larger scales studies of low to mid-redshift galaxies from the latest surveys.",

Kompaniiets Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) In this paper, we construct a detailed circular velocity curve of the Milky Way out to 20 kpc based on the radial component of the Jeans equation in cylindrical coordinates, assuming an axisymmetric gravitational potential, and show its dependence on azimuth. We use only Gaia DR3 data and aim to minimize the use of model data and various assumptions. To build the rotation curves, we used a sample of 4,547,980 RGB stars with measured spatial velocities, covering the Galactic plane in the range of Galactocentric cylindrical coordinates $150^\\circ < \\theta < 210^\\circ$ and 0 < R < 20 kpc. We exclude systematics in the data that may arise from neglecting higher-order moments of the velocity distribution and their dispersions, as well as due to random measurement errors in Gaia. At the distance of the Sun, the circular velocity $V_{\\rm c}(R_0)$ turned out to be ($229.63\\pm0.30$) km s$^{-1}$, which is in good agreement with many previous estimates. The average slope of the circular velocity is $(-2.29\\pm0.05)$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ obtained in the range of $R$ from 6 to 20 kpc and $\\theta$ from 150 to 210 degrees. The determined circular velocity curve has some peculiarities in behavior near $R\\sim$13 and 18 kpc, but in general it does not contradict the results of other authors up to distances where our statistics are reliable.",

Merlin Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We analyzed the spatially resolved and global star formation histories (SFHs) for a sample of 25 TNG50-SKIRT Atlas galaxies to assess the feasibility of reconstructing accurate SFHs from Euclid-like data. This study provides a proof of concept for extracting the spatially resolved SFHs of local galaxies with Euclid, highlighting the strengths and limitations of SFH modeling in the context of next-generation galaxy surveys. We used the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code Prospector to model both spatially resolved and global SFHs using parametric and nonparametric configurations. The input consisted of mock ultraviolet--near-infrared photometry derived from the TNG50 cosmological simulation and processed with the radiative transfer code SKIRT. We show that nonparametric SFHs provide a more effective approach to mitigating the outshining effect by recent star formation, offering improved accuracy in the determination of galaxy stellar properties. Also, we find that the nonparametric SFH model at resolved scales closely recovers the stellar mass formation times (within 0.1~dex) and the ground truth values from TNG50, with an absolute average bias of $0.03$~dex in stellar mass and $0.01$~dex in both specific star formation rate and mass-weighted age. In contrast, larger offsets are estimated for all stellar properties and formation times when using a simple $\\tau$-model SFH, at both resolved and global scales, highlighting its limitations. These results emphasize the critical role of nonparametric SFHs in both global and spatially resolved analyses, as they better capture the complex evolutionary pathways of galaxies and avoid the biases inherent in simple parametric models.",

We find that quasar host galaxies tend to be star-forming galaxies ($\\sim$ 80%) lying on the star-forming MS; the fraction of quasar host galaxies that are quiescent ($\\sim$ 20%) is lower than the fraction of quiescent galaxies in the comparison sample of normal galaxies (54%). We find that the mean star formation rate of quasar host galaxies has increased over the past 100 Myr by a factor of 2--3, but these galaxies were star-forming at all times previously. Our data are more consistent with quasar activity originating together with an increase in the star formation rate of otherwise normal galaxies, similar to episodic star formation in normal spirals. We argue that this indicates that secular processes and minor mergers may be the favored triggers of nuclear activity in the local Universe.",

The code features efficient, fully vectorized force calculations and exhibits near-linear scaling when distributing a single simulation across multiple GPUs, making it suitable for large scale optimization tasks. As a demonstration, we present a case study using a mock GD-1 stellar stream simulation, where we optimize four physical parameters via gradient descent: the accretion time and progenitor mass, as well as the masses of the host Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halo and Miyamoto-Nagai (MN) disk. \\textsc{Odisseo} accurately recovers stream morphology and underlying parameters in a differentiable and scalable framework, providing a powerful tool for dynamical studies of the Milky Way and its accreted substructures.",

Abstract shortened. Comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Classical Cepheids (CCs) have long been considered excellent tracers of the chemical evolution of the Milky Way's young disk. We present a homogeneous, NLTE spectroscopic analysis of 401 Galactic CCs, based on 1,351 high-resolution optical spectra, spanning Galactocentric distances from 4.6 to 29.3 kpc. Using PySME with MARCS atmospheres and state-of-the-art grids of NLTE departure coefficients, we derive atmospheric parameters and abundances for key species tracing multiple nucleosynthetic channels. Our sample-the largest CC NLTE dataset to date-achieves high internal precision and enables robust modeling of present-day thin-disk abundance patterns and radial gradients. We estimate abundance gradients using three analytic prescriptions (linear, logarithmic, bilinear with a break) within a Bayesian, outlier-robust framework, and we also apply Gaussian Process Regression to capture non-parametric variations. We find that NLTE atmospheric parameters differ systematically from LTE determinations. Moreover, iron and most elemental abundance profiles are better described by non-linear behavior rather than by single-slope linear models: logarithmic fits generally outperform simple linear models, while bilinear fits yield inconsistent break radii across elements. Gaussian Process models reveal a consistent outer-disk flattening of [X/H] for nearly all studied elements. The [X/Fe] ratios are largely flat with Galactocentric radius, indicating coherent chemical scaling with iron across the thin disk, with modest positive offsets for Na and Al and mild declines for Mn and Cu. Comparison with recent literature shows overall agreement but highlights NLTE-driven differences, especially in outer-disk abundances. These results provide tighter empirical constraints for chemo-dynamical models of the Milky Way and set the stage for future NLTE mapping with upcoming large spectroscopic surveys.",

Rivilla, Izaskun Jiménez-Serra, Paola Caselli 15 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables. Accepted for publication in Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Sciences - Astrochemistry Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Sulfur-bearing molecules are central to interstellar chemistry, yet their observed abundances in the gas phase remain far below cosmic expectations in dense interstellar regions. Mixed N-S-O species such as thionylimide (HNSO) are particularly relevant, as they incorporate three key biogenic elements. The $cis$ conformer of HNSO has recently been detected in the Galactic Center cloud G+0.693-0.027, but no high-resolution data for the higher energy conformer ($trans$-HNSO) had been available until now. We report the first laboratory detection and rotational spectroscopic characterization of $trans$-HNSO. Spectra were recorded with the Center for Astrochemical Studies Absorption Cell (CASAC) free-space spectrometer employing a hollow-cathode discharge source, yielding 104 assigned transitions between 200 and 530 GHz. A Watson S-reduced Hamiltonian fit reproduced the data with an rms of 40 kHz, providing accurate rotational and centrifugal distortion constants in excellent agreement with CCSD(T) predictions. Although $trans$-HNSO lies only a few kcal/mol above the $cis$ form, it has larger dipole components, making its lines particularly intense (more than 5 times brighter, assuming equal abundances) and a very promising candidate for future astronomical detection. The new measurements enable reliable frequency predictions for astronomical searches and will be added to public databases. Combined with recent evidence for tunneling-driven $trans$-to-$cis$ isomerization at cryogenic temperatures, these results open the way to test directly whether quantum tunneling governs the interstellar distribution of HNSO isomers.",

In this study, we analyzed band-3 ALMACAL maps from 606 calibrator fields, employing a novel machine learning approach to mitigate the often-overlooked bias introduced by the calibrator itself. Supported by extensive simulations, we extended 100 GHz radio AGN counts by approximately 1.5 orders of magnitude in flux density and refined constraints on dusty star-forming galaxies, reaching sensitivities as low as $\\sim$180 $\\mu$Jy. We have improved the sampling, compared to previous results, in the region of the dominant population transition (between dusty star-forming galaxies and radio AGN).

In addition to the supermassive black hole Sgr A*, the inner parsec of our Galactic center is home to numerous fruitful scientific habitats. One of these environments is the S cluster, which consists of two distinct populations: the main-sequence S stars and the dusty G objects. While the majority of the brightest S stars can be classified as young B stars, the G sources can be described as dusty objects whose nature is still under debate. Aims. In this work, we focus on the most prominent G objects in the S cluster and follow their Keplerian trajectory around Sgr A*. With this, we test the predictions based on almost two decades of monitoring of the direct vicinity of our central supermassive black hole using NACO and SINFONI, formerly mounted at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The goal is to increase the existing data baseline for G2/DSO, D9, and X7 to get insights into their evolution on their Keplerian trajectories. In addition, we revisit the massive Young Stellar Object (YSO) X3 and scrutinize the potential impact of its environment on this highly dynamic source. Methods. The successor to the two instruments is called ERIS and offers upgraded optics and improved properties, including an enhanced spectral resolution. We utilize the IFU mode of ERIS, called SPIFFIER. We search for the Doppler-shifted Br{\\gamma} emission line to rediscover peculiar objects in the S cluster using SPIFFIER with the highest available spatial plate scale of 12.5 mas. Furthermore, we will derive the Br{\\gamma} luminosity of G2/DSO to inspect the degree of its change more than ten years after the pericenter passage. If present, a decrease in the Br{\\gamma} luminosity of G2/DSO on its descending part of the orbit would directly impact the direction of the debate about its nature.",

In the model, we first estimate the initial total mass of clumps in a cloud based on the cloud mass, and then generate the initial clump population of the cloud using the initial clump mass function. Next, we model the star formation history (SFH) of the cloud to assign an age to each clump. We then identify the clumps with ages between 2 and 5 Myr and calculate the total embedded cluster mass. Finally, we predict the SFR based on the duration of the embedded phase. The model-predicted SFR is comparable to the observed SFR, demonstrating the validity of the model.",

Oman (Durham-ICC) Appendix C and python code file available in Ancillary files in right-hand panel Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Consecutive points in rotation curve measurements are correlated with each other, but this is usually ignored when constructing galaxy mass models. We apply the data-driven approach proposed by Posti (2022) to include the characteristic amplitude and scale length of such correlations as `nuisance parameters'. We construct mass models for $134$ galaxies from the SPARC rotation curve compilation with Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and pseudo-isothermal sphere (pISO) models for the dark halo. Allowing for correlations in the rotation curves generally improves the goodness of fit for both halo models, often yielding a formally good fit ($\\chi^2_\\mathrm{r}\\approx 1$) and model uncertainties that seem more representative of the constraining power of the data. For both halo models the inference on the typical correlation amplitude and scale length are very similar and physically plausible, $\\sim 20\\,\\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $\\sim 5\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$, respectively. The parametric form that we use to describe the correlations is intentionally simple, and our fitting approach makes the parameters describing possible correlations prone to `absorbing' other systematic errors, so we regard these estimates as upper limits. Without allowing for correlations we find a statistical preference for the pISO over the NFW model for $88$/$134$ galaxies; this preference essentially disappears when correlations are allowed for. Accounting for correlations in rotation curves when constructing mass models fundamentally affects how they are interpreted, highlighting an important systematic uncertainty that affects evidence for cusps or cores in dark matter haloes.",

Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) To date, the Galactic interstellar radial $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S gradient has only been studied with the CS isotopologs, which may be affected by uncertainties due to the use of a single tracer. As another abundant S-bearing molecules, SO and its isotopomer $^{34}$SO could be considered as tracers of the $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S ratio. We present the first systematic observations of SO and $^{34}$SO toward a large sample of molecular clouds with accurate distances, performed with the IRAM 30 m and the 10 m Submillimeter Telescope (SMT). With the IRAM 30 m, SO $2_2-1_1$ was detected in 59 of 82 sources ($\\sim$82%), and $^{34}$SO $2_2-1_1$ in 8 sources ($\\sim$10%). With the SMT 10 m, SO $5_5-4_4$ was detected in 136 of 184 sources ($\\sim$74%), and $^{34}$SO $5_5-4_4$ in 55 of 77 strong SO sources ($\\sim$72%). SO/$^{34}$SO ratios were derived for 8 ($2_2-1_1$) and 55 ($5_5-4_4$) sources. No correlation was found between the SO/$^{34}$SO ratio and heliocentric distance or $T_k$, suggesting negligible distance and fractionation effects. Both LTE and non-LTE analyses consistently suggest that the optical depth effect is also insignificant. $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S ratios from the $2_2-1_1$ transitions follow the increasing radial trend proposed by previous CS species measurements, while those from the $5_5-4_4$ lines are systematically lower. The lower transitions of SO and $^{34}$SO may be suitable tracers of $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S, though the detections are rare. Comparisons between measurements and Galactic chemical evolution model suggest that the nucleosynthesis prescriptions need to be revised in the low-metallicity regime, but more data for the outermost Galactic regions are crucial for drawing strong conclusions.",

The origin of this chemical signature provides an insight into the early star and galaxy formation processes, yet remains unclear. We performed high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of massive galaxies at high redshift ($z\\sim10$) in rare density peaks, incorporating various chemical evolution channels including stellar winds, core-collapse, Type Ia supernovae, and asymptotic giant branch stars. Our simulations reproduce several key features of high-redshift galaxies: (1) stars form with high efficiencies ($>0.1$) at the center of rare peak halos, creating very compact galaxies similar to GN-z11; (2) high N/O ratios emerge during the first 10-20 Myr of intense starburst, before being diluted by CCSNe; (3) multiple star clusters form in and around the galaxy with high efficiency ($\\sim20\\%$), some of which exhibit high N/O ratios and sodium-oxygen anti-correlations similar to those observed in local globular clusters. Although our simulations can reproduce the high log(N/O) values (up to -0.61, exceeding the solar value by 0.25 dex), they remain below the observational lower limits of GN-z11, indicating room for improvement through additional chemical evolution channels, such as supermassive stars.",

To allow the astronomical identification, we first performed precise laboratory measurements of the thiophenol discharge products system. These measurements, conducted in the radio band using a chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave spectrometer, enabled us to characterize this highly polar molecular species and provided unambiguous fingerprints needed to identify this organosulfur compound in space, which now ranks as the largest interstellar sulfur-bearing molecule. These results herald the discovery of a new family of prebiotically relevant sulfur-bearing species, potentially acting as a bridge between the chemical inventory of the interstellar medium and the composition of the minor bodies of the Solar System.",

For the first time, we show that the Ca II PVF velocity distribution, measured for the same events at the same phases as Si II, is predominantly unimodal, in contrast to the well-known bimodal Si II PVF distribution that supports the high-velocity/normal-velocity division. This contrast likely reflects a subclass-dependent formation depth of the Ca II line, as supported by a positive correlation ($>3.3\\sigma$) between $\\Delta m_{15}$ and the velocity offset between Ca II and Si II PVFs, particularly in faster-declining SNe Ia. Importantly, HVFs do not significantly bias PVF velocity distributions. A significant negative correlation ($>3.3\\sigma$) between Si II PVF velocity and $\\Delta m_{15}$ is found only for HVF-weak SNe Ia, consistent with more energetic explosions yielding faster ejecta, while this trend vanishes in HVF-strong events, likely due to circumstellar interaction. These results underscore the critical role of HVFs and SN Ia subclass in interpreting ejecta kinematics in both models and observations.",

Starkenburg, Giuseppe Donatiello, Alis Deason, Denis Erkal, Ethan D. Taylor 6 pages, 2 figures, submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics. Comments welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) While mergers between massive galaxies and their dwarf satellites are well studied, the properties of dwarf-dwarf satellite mergers are not well constrained. Stellar streams trace satellite disruption and, in the dwarf galaxy regime, are predicted to provide novel constraints on low-mass galaxy evolution and dark matter. However, the mass ratios required to form these streams make them challenging to detect. We present a preview of the Stellar Stream Legacy Survey (SSLS) in the dwarf galaxy regime. The SSLS aims to produce a statistically large, homogeneous sample of stellar streams, in order to yield new constraints on galaxy formation through comparison with theory. We visually inspect dwarf galaxies using the Legacy Imaging Survey (and DECaLS footprints, r-band 29 mag arcsec-2) within 4-35 Mpc. We develop a classification metric to categorise accretion debris around dwarf galaxies, and measure the frequency of accretion features in the footprint. We present the first release of accretion features around dwarf galaxies, including 1 stream, 11 shells, and 8 asymmetric stellar halos, of which 17 constitute new identifications. We find that less than 5.07 percent of dwarfs (37/730) contain detectable accretion features, which is lower than the SSLS results for massive galaxies, and discuss a tentative shell detection bias. Our results highlight the difficulty of detecting streams around dwarf galaxies, and identify the need for improved theoretical modelling of low-mass merger morphologies. Nevertheless, they place observational constraints on hierarchical mass assembly in this regime.",

Our FAST observed targets are combined with other AGN-hosting dwarf galaxies covered in the ALFALFA footprint to form a more comprehensive sample. Utilizing the information from optical surveys, we further divide them into isolated and accompanied subsamples by their vicinity of nearby massive galaxies. We compare the Hi gas abundance and star-forming rate (SFR) between the subsamples to assess the role of internal and external processes that may regulate the gas content in dwarf galaxies. As a result, we find that AGN are more commonly identified in accompanied dwarf galaxies than in their isolated counterparts. Meanwhile, AGN-hosting dwarf galaxies have slightly but significant lower Hi mass fraction relatively to the non-AGN control sample in accompanied dwarf galaxies. On the other hand, we find a decreasing SFR in AGN-hosting dwarf galaxies towards denser environments, as well as an extremely low incidence of quenched isolated dwarfs within both AGN and non-AGN subsamples. These results indicate that although these AGN could potentially regulate the gas reservoir of dwarf galaxies, environmental effects are likely the dominant quenching mechanism in the low-mass universe.",

      "abstract": "Identifying bars in galaxies using machine learning Rajit Shrivastava Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) This thesis presents an innovative framework for the automated detection and characterization of galactic bars, pivotal structures in spiral galaxies, using the YOLO-OBB (You Only Look Once with Oriented Bounding Boxes) model. Traditional methods for identifying bars are often labor-intensive and subjective, limiting their scalability for large astronomical surveys. To address this, a synthetic dataset of 1,000 barred spiral galaxy images was generated, incorporating realistic components such as disks, bars, bulges, spiral arms, stars, and observational noise, modeled through Gaussian, Ferrers, and Sersic functions. The YOLO-OBB model, trained on this dataset for six epochs, achieved robust validation metrics, including a precision of 0.93745, recall of 0.85, and mean Average Precision (mAP50) of 0.94173. Applied to 10 real galaxy images, the model extracted physical parameters, such as bar lengths ranging from 2.27 to 9.70 kpc and orientations from 13.41$^\\circ$ to 134.11$^\\circ$, with detection confidences between 0.26 and 0.68. These measurements, validated through pixel-to-kiloparsec conversions, align with established bar sizes, demonstrating the model's reliability. The methodology's scalability and interpretability enable efficient analysis of complex galaxy morphologies, particularly for dwarf galaxies and varied orientations. Future research aims to expand the dataset to 5,000 galaxies and integrate the Tremaine-Weinberg method to measure bar pattern speeds, enhancing insights into galaxy dynamics and evolution. This work advances automated morphological analysis, offering a transformative tool for large-scale astronomical studies.",

These data have enabled the discovery of numerous star clusters obscured by high and spatially variable extinction. Most previous searches relied on visual inspection of individual tiles, which is inefficient and biased against faint or low-density systems. Aims: We aim to develop an automated, homogeneous algorithm for systematic cluster detection across different surveys. Here, we apply our method to VVVX data covering low-latitude regions of the Galactic bulge and disk, affected by extinction and crowding. Methods: We introduce the Consensus-based Algorithm for Nonparametric Detection of Star Clusters (CANDiSC), which integrates kernel density estimation, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), and nearest-neighbour density estimation within a consensus framework. A stellar overdensity is classified as a candidate if identified by at least two of these methods. We apply CANDiSC to 680 tiles in the VVVX PSF photometric catalogue, covering approximately 1100 square degrees. Results: We detect 163 stellar overdensities, of which 118 are known clusters. Cross-matching with recent catalogues yields five additional matches, leaving 40 likely new candidates absent from existing compilations. The estimated false-positive rate is below 5 percent. Conclusions: CANDiSC offers a robust and scalable approach for detecting stellar clusters in deep near-infrared surveys, successfully recovering known systems and revealing new candidates in the obscured and crowded regions of the Galactic plane.",

The B4R receiver was developed based on the dual-polarization sideband-separating mixer technology of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, and is equipped with a fast Fourier transform digital spectrometer, XFFTS. The primary science objective is the spectroscopic redshift identification of high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies, complementing the existing 3 mm Redshift Search Receiver by enabling the detection of multiple carbon monoxide lines. Additionally, the B4R receiver broadens the range of science cases possible with the LMT, including astrochemistry, as the 2 mm band encompasses unique molecular lines such as deuterated molecules and shock tracers. During on-site commissioning in 2018 and 2019, we successfully demonstrated on-the-fly mapping and position-switching observations toward the Orion Molecular Cloud 1 and bright high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies, respectively. We confirmed that the installed B4R system largely met its basic performance specifications. Furthermore, we measured the LMT's aperture efficiencies across the entire B4R frequency range (130-160 GHz), finding them to be roughly consistent with expectations based on a surface accuracy of 100 $\\mu$m and the receiver optics design. These results with the B4R will enable the most sensitive single-dish spectroscopic observations at 2 mm using the LMT.",

After a validation process using high-resolution FTS and CRDS spectra, about 60,000 lines of the four most abundant isotopologues were replaced from the dyad to the triacontad regions. These changes amount to 56,000 transition wavenumbers, 16,000 line intensities, 30,000 pressure-broadening half-widths, and 3500 assignments. 40,000 new lines were added, extending the database from 12,000 cm$^{-1}$ up to 14,000 cm$^{-1}$, and covering some gaps. A greater focus was brought on the pentad, octad, and tetradecad regions, targeted by several remote instruments. In these regions, comparisons of spectral fits from multiple line lists were performed, taking only the parameters that provide best fit for each line. In the $\\nu _3$ band, in addition to replacing the previous values, gathered speed-independent pressure broadenings of $^{12}$CH$_4$ were used to fit Pade-approximant functions. These functions then replaced any outdated experimental data in $\\nu _3$, missing data in the new lines, as well as the values that were determined to be outside their physical boundaries. The CH$_3$D broadenings were replaced in the same manner, for missing and low or high values, using a semi-empirical formula instead.",

Yet, a comprehensive and systematic catalog of mid-infrared variable sources has remained unavailable. In this work, we construct the first large-scale mid-infrared variability catalog based on the unTimely coadded photometry, covering tens of millions of sources. By employing a Bayesian Gaussian mixture model with a Dirichlet process, we identified 8,256,042 variable sources in the W1 band and 7,147,661 in the W2 band, significantly expanding the landscape of known mid-infrared variables. In addition to robust variability metrics, our analysis highlights rare and extreme outliers through dedicated outlier-detection algorithms, enabling the discovery of unusual classes of objects such as eruptive young stellar objects, highly variable active galactic nuclei, and other rare transients. This unprecedented dataset provides a new foundation for time-domain astronomy in the mid-infrared, offering complementary insights to optical and near-infrared surveys, and opening the door to systematic investigations of stellar evolution, accretion processes, and dust-enshrouded astrophysical environments on a Galactic and extragalactic scale.",

The observed separation distribution of known brown dwarf (BD) binaries is potentially biased towards separations larger than the angular resolution limits of current techniques. Previous imaging analyses suffer from incompleteness at separations $<2\\lambda/D$; our aim is to probe within this limit to identify previously missed companions. We evaluate the performance of our technique on artificial data across 8 WFC3/IR filters and a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios (S/N), determining our ability to accurately recover injected companions and identifying the region of parameter space where false positive fits are likely. Here, we demonstrate the capability of this technique to recover companions at sub-pixel separations on the WFC3/IR detector -- below the diffraction limit in multiple filters. For F160W at a typical S/N of 75, we resolve companions separated by 0.8 pixels (104 mas, $0.759\\lambda/D$) at 1.5 magnitudes contrast with $>90\\%$ confidence. We achieve the closest angular resolution for any detection method with WFC3/IR imaging to date. Compared to previous BD multiplicity surveys with WFC3/IR, we achieve a 2.5$\\times$ improvement in separation sensitivity at contrasts of 0-3 magnitudes in F127M. We have demonstrated that applying our improved technique to archival HST images of field BDs will thus probe down to separations of 1 au, in one of the largest high angular resolution surveys of such objects to date.",

Gómez-Garrido Accepted 28 October 2025 in Astronomy & Astrophysics. 14 pages Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) There is a group of post-AGB stars that are part of a binary system and that show a significant NIR excess. These systems are known to host disks with Keplerian or quasi-Keplerian dynamics and to drive outflows of gas escaping from the rotating disk. These binary post-AGB stars can be categorized into two subclasses depending on the predominance of specific kinematic components: disk-dominated and outflow-dominated sources. We present the survey of such sources observed in CO using the IRAM-30m telescope, in which we aim to identify the molecular gas in these circumbinary-disk-containing post-AGB nebulae. We aim to analyze the mass distribution of the disk objects studied in CO. We present high-sensitivity mm-wave observations of the CO line emission from ten binary post-AGB stars. Using the derived formulation and observational data, we calculated the mass of the total gas in the CO-emitting regions of these nebulae. The logarithmic distribution of nebular masses was analyzed using a normal model that incorporates censored data, enabling a more comprehensive analysis and yielding more accurate and representative results. CO emission is detected in six post-AGB nebulae from our sample. We have significantly increased the sample of observed sources in CO lines. Some of these objects exhibit very weak molecular emission. Within the sample of disk-containing sources, the total gas mass spans a range of 1E-4 to 1E-1 Mo. The results derived from this work, along with those from a previous CO single-dish survey and interferometric data, show that this class of binary post-AGB stars exhibits a large range of nebular masses (including both the rotating disk and the expanding component), with variations exceeding a factor of 600. The typical nebular mass of these objects, accounting for both detections and non-detections through censored data analysis, is approximately 2E-3 Mo.",

Napolitano, Crescenzo Tortora, Rodrigo von Marttens, Luciano Casarini, Rui Li, Weipeng Lin Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The galaxy total mass inside the effective radius encode important information on the dark matter and galaxy evolution model. Total \"central\" masses can be inferred via galaxy dynamics or with gravitational lensing, but these methods have limitations. We propose a novel approach, based on Random Forest, to make predictions on the total and dark matter content of galaxies using simple observables from imaging and spectroscopic surveys. We use catalogs of multi-band photometry, sizes, stellar mass, kinematic \"measurements\" (features) and dark matter (targets) of simulated galaxies, from Illustris-TNG100 hydrodynamical simulation, to train a Mass Estimate machine Learning Algorithm (Mela). We separate the simulated sample in passive early-type galaxies (ETGs), both \"normal\" and \"dwarf\", and active late-type galaxies (LTGs) and show that the mass estimator can accurately predict the galaxy dark masses inside the effective radius in all samples. We finally test the mass estimator against the central mass estimates of a series of low redshift (z$\\leq$0.1) datasets, including SPIDER, MaNGA/DynPop and SAMI dwarf galaxies, derived with standard dynamical methods based on Jeans equations. Dynamical masses are reproduced within 0.30 dex ($\\sim2\\sigma$), with a limited fraction of outliers and almost no bias. This is independent of the sophistication of the kinematical data collected (fiber vs. 3D spectroscopy) and the dynamical analysis adopted (radial vs. axisymmetric Jeans equations, virial theorem). This makes Mela a powerful alternative to predict the mass of galaxies of massive stage-IV surveys' datasets.",

The density distributions are available as data behind figures in the journal publication. Please feel free to contact us in the meantime if you would like to use them Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The effect of supernovae (SNe) on star-formation in the interstellar medium (ISM) depends sensitively on where SNe explode with respect to ISM clouds. Observationally, SN ISM environments characterized by spatially-resolved gas maps can empirically guide the placement of SNe in subgrid models, but unfortunately such measurements remain scarce, as SNe are rare and often distant. Here we demonstrate a new approach -- mapping the ISM around evolved massive stars that are soon to explode. These provide a substantially larger sample of `explosion sites' (than just historical SNe) in nearby galaxies that have high-resolution atomic and molecular ISM maps from Jansky VLA and ALMA. We demonstrate this technique in the well-resolved Local Group spiral M33 by analyzing the 50 pc-scale projected ISM densities around red supergiants (RSGs, 8-30 M$_{\\odot}$ stars) Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs, $>$30 M$_{\\odot}$ stars), and supernova remnants (SNRs). We find a \\emph{mass-dependent} correlation between stars and gas clouds, with atleast 45\\% of WRs and upto 77\\% of RSGs having no detectable H$_2$ at their pixel locations. In the sample with H$_2$ detections, we find that more massive younger progenitors are coincident with denser gas. We show that the density distributions for stars $>$15 M$_{\\odot}$ are statistically distinct from random alignment of stars and gas in M33. Our work provides the first observationally-derived estimate of the fraction of the SN-producing stellar population correlated with ISM density peaks. We demonstrate how this can be compared with galaxy simulations, and advocate similar comparisons to the community for constraining sub-grid models.",

EAGLE UDGs are not a distinct population, but rather a subset of dwarf galaxies, as their properties generally form a continuous distribution with those of normal dwarf galaxies. Unlike the situations in previous studies, the extended sizes of field UDGs in EAGLE are not driven by high halos spin or by supernova-induced stellar expansion, but instead largely arise from high spins in their star-forming gas and thus the newly formed stars at large radii. This might be attributed to galactic fountains, by which star-forming gas are launched to large halo-centric distances and acquire additional angular momentum through interactions with the circumgalactic medium. For satellite UDGs, ${\\sim} 60 \\%$ of them were already UDGs before falling into the host galaxy, while the remaining ${\\sim} 40\\%$ were normal galaxies prior to infall and subsequently transformed into UDGs due to tidal effects after infall.",

Vílchez, Igor A. Zinchenko, Asier Castrillo, Marta Gavilán, Sandra Zamora, Ángeles I. Díaz 14 pages, 9 figures, Revised version accepted for publication by The Open Journal of Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The derivation of sulphur chemical abundances in the gas-phase of star-forming galaxies is explored in this work, using the emission lines produced in these regions in the optical part of the spectrum and by means of photoionization models. We adapted the code HII-CHI-mistry to account for these abundances by implementing additional grids of models that assume a variable sulphur-to-oxygen abundance ratio, beyond the commonly assumed solar value. The addition of these models, and their use in a new iteration of the code allows us to use sulphur lines to precisely estimate the sulphur abundance, even in the absence of auroral lines. This approach aligns with the results from the direct method, and no additional assumptions about the ionization correction factor are needed, as the models directly predict the total sulphur abundance. We applied this new methodology to a large sample of star-forming regions from the MaNGA survey, and we explored the variation of the S/O ratio as a function of metallicity, making corrections for the significant contribution from diffuse ionized gas, which particularly affects the [SII] emission. Our results indicate no significant deviations from the solar S/O value in the range 8.0 < 12+log(O/H) < 8.7, where the bulk of the MaNGA sample stays, but also with possible enhancements of sulphur at the high metallicity regime. This may be linked to the depletion of oxygen in the gas-phase due to its incorporation onto dust grains, as it remains when other metallicity indicators independent of this depletion, as S/H itself, are used instead.",

Bouche, Ramona Augustin, Sebastiano Cantalupo, Hsiao-Wen Chen, Martin Wendt Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate cool HI gas traced by Lyman series absorption around 256 galaxies at z ~ 0.48 (median stellar mass, log10(M*/Msun) = 8.7) using 15 background quasars (median impact parameter, D = 140 pkpc), as part of the MUSE Quasar-fields Blind Emitters Survey (MUSEQuBES). We find that the HI column density (N(HI)) profile around isolated star-forming galaxies spanning ~3 dex in stellar mass is well described by a power law with slope ~ -3 when expressed as a function of normalized impact parameter D/Rvir. The HI covering fraction (k) within the virial radius for log10(N(HI)/cm^{-2}) = 14 is significantly lower in high-mass passive galaxies than in isolated star-forming galaxies. The k-profile of isolated star-forming galaxies suggests a characteristic size of the HI-rich CGM of ~ 1.5 Rvir across the stellar mass range. The mean HI mass in the outer CGM (0.3-1 Rvir ) increases with stellar mass, ranging from ~ 10^5 to 10^6.6 Msun. The b-parameters of the strongest HI components correlate and anti-correlate with specific star-formation rate (sSFR) and mass, respectively, with >2 sigma significance. Broad Lya absorbers (BLAs) with b > 60 km/s are predominantly associated with high-mass galaxies, likely tracing the warm-hot phase of the CGM. The velocity centroids of H i components indicate that absorbers at D < Rvir are largely consistent with being gravitationally bound to their galaxies, independent of stellar mass. Finally, leveraging ~ 3000 galaxies from the wide-field Magellan follow-up of six MUSEQuBES fields, we find that non-isolated galaxies exhibit an HI-rich environment extending roughly three times farther than in isolated counterparts.",

Their spectra exhibit broad Balmer emission lines ($\\gtrsim1000\\rm~km~s^{-1}$), alongside absorption features and a pronounced Balmer break -- evidence for a dense, neutral hydrogen medium with the $n=2$ state. When interpreted as arising from AGN broad-line regions, inferred black hole masses from local scaling relations exceed expectations given their stellar masses, challenging models of early black hole-galaxy co-evolution. However, radiative transfer effects in dense media may also impact the formation of hydrogen emission lines. We model three scattering processes shaping hydrogen line profiles: resonance scattering by hydrogen in the $n=2$ state, Raman scattering of UV radiation by ground-state hydrogen, and Thomson scattering by free electrons. Using 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations with multi-branching resonance transitions, we examine their imprint on line shapes and ratios. Resonance scattering produces strong deviations from Case B flux ratios, clear differences between H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$, and encodes gas kinematics in line profiles but cannot broaden H$\\beta$ due to conversion to Pa$\\alpha$. While Raman scattering can yield broad wings, scattering of UV continuum is disfavored given the absence of strong FWHM variations across transitions. Raman scattering of higher Lyman-series emission can produce H$\\alpha$/H$\\beta$ wing width ratios of $\\gtrsim1.28$, agreeing with observations. Thomson scattering can reproduce the observed $\\gtrsim1000~\\rm km\\, s^{-1}$ wings under plausible conditions, e.g., $T_{\\rm e} \\sim 10^4\\rm \\, K$ and $N_{\\rm e}\\sim10^{24}\\rm~cm^{-2}$ -- and lead to black hole mass overestimates by factors $\\gtrsim10$.

Star-forming galaxies are identified using the $g-z$ color, and $F_{\\mathrm{sf}}$ is measured as a function of redshift, cluster halo mass, and galaxy stellar mass. Field galaxies are used as a comparison sample to reduce selection effects. For BCGs, $F_{\\mathrm{sf}}$ increases with redshift, showing a slow rise below $z \\sim 0.4 - 0.5$ and a more rapid increase above this range. In contrast, $F_{\\mathrm{sf}}$ decreases with increasing cluster halo mass and BCG stellar mass. At the low stellar mass end, BCGs exhibit higher star-forming fractions than field galaxies, suggesting enhanced star formation likely fueled by cold gas accretion from the intracluster medium. Also, star-forming BCGs tend to show larger projected offsets from the optical cluster density peak than quenching BCGs, indicating ongoing assembly. The analysis of the specific star formation rate (sSFR) further indicates a transition in the dominant mechanism driving star formation in BCGs: cooling flows are likely responsible at low redshift, while gas-rich mergers play a greater role at higher redshift. The shift in dominance occurs around $z \\sim 0.5$, aligning with the steep rise in $F_{\\mathrm{sf}}$ of BCG.",

Submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Measuring the ionizing photon production efficiency $\\xi_{\\mathrm{ion,0}}$ -- the ratio of ionizing photon output rate $Q_{\\rm H^0}$ to UV continuum luminosity $L_{\\rm UV}$ -- in galaxies at $z > 6$ is crucial for constraining their contribution to cosmic reionization. We present integrated and spatially resolved measurements of $\\xi_{\\mathrm{ion,0}}$ for 12 exceptionally bright ($M_\\mathrm{UV} \\sim -22$ mag) star-forming galaxies at $z \\sim 7$ from the REBELS survey. These measurements are based on JWST NIRSpec/IFU PRISM spectroscopy, probing the rest-frame UV and optical regime. Notably, in 8 of the 12 galaxies, the spectral coverage includes H$\\alpha$, enabling self-consistent dust attenuation estimates in both the ionized gas and stellar continuum via the Balmer decrement and rest-UV slope, respectively. We find global $\\log\\xi_{\\mathrm{ion,0}}$ values ranging from $25.19\\pm0.11$ to $25.61\\pm0.11$, with a weighted mean of $25.44\\pm0.15$, consistent with the canonical value of $\\sim25.3$. Using a sample of 25 star-forming clumps within these galaxies, we explore local variations in LyC production efficiency, finding a broader range, from $24.52\\pm0.21$ to $26.18\\pm0.61$. We identify strong correlations between $\\xi_{\\mathrm{ion,0}}$ and specific star formation rate, star formation surface density, H$\\beta$ equivalent width, and stellar mass. Clumps with the highest $\\xi_{\\mathrm{ion,0}}$ exhibit $\\mathrm{EW}_0(\\mathrm{H}\\beta) \\ge 150$ Angstrom, consistent with young stellar ages. From previous Ly$\\alpha$ measurements in three galaxies, we estimate a typical Ly$\\alpha$ escape fraction of $f_{\\rm esc, Ly\\alpha} \\sim 2\\%$, suggesting similar or lower escape fractions for LyC photons. Combining this with our H$\\alpha$ measurements, we infer ionized bubble sizes $\\sim 1$ pMpc, aligned with expectations from Ly$\\alpha$-detected systems and reionization models.",

Upcoming time-domain surveys like the Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) offer a major opportunity to discover them in large numbers. Early identification is crucial for timely follow-up observations. We develop a deep learning pipeline to detect LSNe using multi-band, multi-epoch image cutouts. Our model is based on a 2D convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM2D) architecture, designed to capture both spatial and temporal correlations in time-series imaging data. Predictions are made after each observation in the time series, with accuracy improving as more data arrive. We train the model on realistic simulations derived from Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) data, which closely matches LSST in depth and filters. This work focuses exclusively on Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). LSNe Ia are injected onto HSC luminous red galaxies (LRGs) at various phases of evolution to create positive examples. Negative examples include variable sources from HSC Transient Survey (including unclassified transients), and simulated unlensed SNe Ia in LRG and spiral galaxies. Our multi-band model shows rapid classification improvements during the initial few observations and quickly reaches high detection efficiency: at a fixed false-positive rate (FPR) of $0.01\\%$, the true-positive rate (TPR) reaches $\\gtrsim 60\\%$ by the 7th observation and exceeds $\\gtrsim 70\\%$ by the 9th. Among the negative examples, SNe in LRGs remain the primary source of FPR, as they can resemble their lensed counterparts under certain conditions. The model detects quads more effectively than doubles and performs better on systems with larger image separations. Although trained and tested on HSC-like data, our approach applies to any cadenced imaging survey, particularly LSST.",

Pötzl, Avinash Kumar, Michael Janssen 14 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics. Code available at this https URL Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) is a powerful technique that can achieve sub-milliarcsecond resolution. However, it requires complex and often manual post-correlation calibration to correct for instrumental, geometric, and propagation-related errors. Unlike connected-element interferometers, VLBI arrays typically provide raw visibilities rather than science-ready data, and existing pipelines are largely semi-automated and reliant on user supervision. We present VIPCALs, a fully automated, end-to-end calibration pipeline for continuum VLBI data that operates without human intervention or prior knowledge of the dataset. Designed for scalability to thousands of sources and heterogeneous archival observations, VIPCALs addresses the needs of initiatives such as the Search for Milli-Lenses (SMILE) project. Implemented in Python using ParselTongue, VIPCALs reproduces the standard AIPS calibration workflow in a fully unsupervised mode. Besides the usual calibration tasks, the pipeline also performs automatic reference antenna selection, calibrator identification, and generates diagnostic outputs for inspection. We validated it on a representative sample of Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data corresponding to 1000 sources from the SMILE project. VIPCALs successfully calibrated observations of 955 of the test sources across multiple frequency bands. Over 91% of the calibrated datasets achieved successful fringe fitting on target in at least half of the solutions attempted. The median ratio of calibrated visibilities to initial total visibilities was 0.87. The average processing time was below 10 minutes per dataset, demonstrating both efficiency and scalability. VIPCALs enables robust, reproducible, and fully automated calibration of VLBI continuum data, significantly lowering the entry barrier for VLBI science and making large-scale projects like SMILE feasible.",

However, they can play an important role in stellar structure and evolution models through efficient angular momentum transport and their impact on internal mixing. We strive to explain the 9 components of one frequency multiplet, identified as a low-order quadrupole gravity mode detected in the light curve of the beta Cep pulsator HD 192575 assembled by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We update the frequencies of the quadrupole mode under investigation using a standard prewhitening method applied to the 1951.46 d TESS light curve, showing that an internal magnetic field is required to simultaneously explain all 9 components. We implement theoretical pulsation computations applicable to the low-order modes of a beta Cep pulsator including the Coriolis force, as well as a magnetic field that is misaligned with respect to the rotation axis. We apply the theoretical description to perform asteroseismic modelling of the amplitudes and frequencies in the multiplet of the quadrupole g-mode of this evolved beta Cep star. Pulsation predictions based on the measured internal rotation frequency of the star cannot explain the observed 9-component frequency splittings of the quadrupole low-order gravity mode. By contrast, we show that the combined effect of the Coriolis force caused by the near-core rotation with a period of about 5.3 d and the Lorentz force due to an internal inclined magnetic field with a maximum strength of around 24 kG does provide a proper explanation of the 9 multiplet frequencies and their relative amplitudes. Given the stellar mass of about 12 solar masses, this work presents the detection and magneto-gravito-asteroseismic modelling of a stable internal magnetic field buried inside an evolved rotating supernova progenitor.",

Sebastian Pineda, Stefano Bellotti, Jackie Villadsen, Aline Vidotto, Julien Morin, Colin P. Folsom 23 pages, 9 figures, ApJ accepted Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The recent detections of radio emission from the nearby exoplanet host, YZ Ceti, suggest that the star is possibly interacting with its rocky innermost planet. These radio emissions are characterized by strong circular polarization, and appear to repeat within consistent orbital phase windows dictated by the orbital position of YZ Ceti b. If confirmed, this interaction would provide a first means to concretely assess the magnetic field of a close-in rocky exoplanet. This kind of magnetic star-planet interaction (SPI) should depend on both the exoplanetary orbit, and the geometry of the stellar magnetic field. In this article, we report measurements of the large-scale magnetic field topology of the star YZ Ceti for the first time, and interpret the cumulative radio data sets in that context to evaluate the plausibility of magnetic SPIs. We find evidence both against and in support of the SPI hypothesis, but crucially that the measured magnetic field does not rule out SPI scenarios. However, clear evaluation of these possibilities requires more accurate assessments of the magnetic field evolution across time. We additionally suggest that YZ Ceti may be exhibiting planet-induced flaring potentially triggered by exoplanet crossings of the Alfvén surface as the planet orbit approaches the stellar magnetic equator, and YZ Ceti b experiences dramatic shifts in the ambient field, its polarity, and connectivity to the host star.",

El Mellah, D. Defrère, M. Ireland Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Long secondary periods (LSPs) occur in about one-third of evolved stars, yet their origin remains unclear. The leading explanations are oscillatory convective modes and a binary companion embedded in dust. We investigate the LSP of the red giant RT Pav using multi-wavelength VLTI interferometry (PIONIER, GRAVITY, MATISSE; 1.5-5.0 microns), obtained near the phase where a companion would appear most separated. These data, combined with photometry and Gaia DR3 astrometry, constrain possible companion masses, orbits, and photometric effects. We model the interferometric observables using uniform-disk, limb-darkened, ellipse, binary, and oscillatory convective dipole representations, supported by Monte Carlo simulations. Gaia limits any companion to a mass whose Roche-lobe volume is too small to hold the obscuring or scattering material required to reproduce the observed LSP modulation. While binary fits can yield low chi-squared values, the inferred positions are inconsistent across wavelength, closure phases do not increase with wavelength as dusty companions predict, and significant detections occur in only two of four bands. Theoretical estimates show that a roughly 1 percent flux companion at LSP-like separations should be consistently detectable for typical O-rich AGB dust, but is not consistently observed. In contrast, an oscillatory convective dipole with a temperature contrast of about 200 K reproduces the H-band morphology and visible-light amplitude without violating Gaia or photometric constraints, and binary-like residuals vanish when dipole models are fitted. Our results therefore favor oscillatory convective modes over a binary origin for the LSP in RT Pav. Time-resolved spectro-interferometry across the LSP cycle is a natural next step.",

On 2022 October 4, its first scientific flight took place at the Dachaidan area in Qinghai province of China. We describe briefly the BBWLC mission including its optical design, mechanical structure, pointing system, the first flight and results associated with the data processing approach. Preliminary analysis of the data shows that BBWLC imaged the Kcorona with three streamer structures on the west limb of the Sun. To further confirm the coronal signals obtained by BBWLC, comparisonswere made with observations of the Kcoronagraph of the High Altitude Observatory and the Atmospheric ImagingAssembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. We conclude that BBWLC eventually observed the white-light corona in its first scientific flight.",

Interstellar dust is also directly observed in the vicinity of the Sun with dust detectors onboard spacecraft, and it is known to be affected by the interplanetary magnetic field. The main goal of this work is to show how the change in the interplanetary magnetic field with the solar cycle affects the infrared picture of the heliosphere. To compose a synthetic intensity map of the interstellar dust thermal emission, we used the Monte Carlo method to calculate the distribution of the dust particles inside the heliosphere. We considered the effects of the heliosphere boundaries and the non-stationary current sheet. The change in the Parker magnetic field caused by the solar activity cycle leads distinguishable features in the mid-infrared emission maps of the heliosphere. The distribution of the interstellar dust in the vicinity of the Sun we calculated suggests that small particles linger outside of the heliosphere, and medium-size particles are mostly affected by the changing interplanetary magnetic field, which leads to number density waves in the tail region of the heliosphere. Finally, large particles form a bulge behind the Sun.",

It aims to elucidate the mechanisms behind solar eruptions and coronal heating, and to directly measure the coronal magnetic field. The mission will perform in situ measurements of the current sheet between coronal mass ejections and their associated solar flares, and energetic particles produced by either reconnection or fast-mode shocks driven by coronal mass ejections. This will help to resolve the nature of reconnections in current sheets, and energetic particle acceleration regions. To investigate coronal heating, the mission will observe nano-flares on scales smaller than 70 km in the solar corona and regions smaller than 40 km in the photosphere, where magnetohydrodynamic waves originate. To study solar wind acceleration mechanisms, the mission will also track the process of ion charge-state freezing in the solar wind. A key achievement will be the observation of the coronal magnetic field at unprecedented proximity to the solar photosphere. The polar regions will also be observed at close range, and the inner edge of the solar system dust disk may be identified for the first time. This work presents the detailed background, science, and mission concept of SCOPE and discusses how we aim to address the questions mentioned above.",

However, dust growth barriers appear to impede the ability to assemble sufficiently large dust particles to trigger strong clumping, providing a serious impediment to planetesimal formation. Aims: We aim to address the possibility to enhance dust clumping with dust growth in SI-produced structures, and to estimate the impact of the shift of the dust fragmentation threshold in regions where the SI has enhanced the dust density. Methods: We perform two-dimensional numerical simulations of the SI with a monodisperse description of dust growth, accounting for the impact of mass loading of the dust on the sound speed of the gas and dust mixture when computing dust collisional velocities. Results: Dust mass loading reduces collision velocities in high density regions, allowing dust particles to survive to larger sizes before shattering. In turn, dust clumping is boosted as particles grow in size, as long as they remain sufficiently coupled to the gas. Conclusions: This two-way synergy between dust growth and clumping, which depends on the initial dust-to-gas ratio and dust elastic properties, allows denser dust clumps to form and thus facilitates the onset of planetesimal formation.",

Our motivation was a peculiar beating pattern in its light curves from all-sky surveys and our own observations. Using \\textit{Gaia} DR3 and OGLE-IV photometry, we show that this variability arises from blending with a nearby, unrelated Mira variable (\\textit{Gaia} DR3 406134544052580377 = OGLE-BLG-LPV-241930). Analysis of VPHAS+ and Pan-STARRS imaging, combined with optical and infrared spectroscopy from the Southern African Large Telescope and ESO New Technology Telescope, further reveals that the symbiotic star has been misidentified in the literature. We identify the correct counterpart as \\textit{Gaia} DR3 4061345440488592896 (=OGLE-BLG-LPV-241932), a Mira with a 161-day period. Its infrared spectrum displays prominent emission lines and is remarkably similar to those of other symbiotic Miras. Based on our data and previous studies, Terz V 2513 likely experienced a symbiotic nova outburst in the past. This study highlights the importance of careful analysis of survey light curves in crowded fields and demonstrates how combining multi-wavelength photometry, spectroscopy, and high-precision \\textit{Gaia} data can disentangle blended sources and accurately determine their nature.",

All three components of the system are O- or B-type stars. We carried out a comprehensive study of the system, based on light curves from TESS and other instruments, a new series of echelle spectra, older spectra from the ESO archive, and several VLTI interferometric observations. Due to the large amount of different types of data covering both orbits in the system, we obtained a more precise value of the long orbital period ($1603.24\\pm0.19$ d) and fully determined all other orbital parameters. Although both orbits are eccentric, their period ratio is large enough for the system to be dynamically stable. The inner and outer orbits are in the same plane, which means that no Kozai-Lidov mechanism is acting in the system. Assuming solar metallicity in our MESA models, we found ages of $(4.4\\pm 0.1)$, $(4.7\\pm 0.2)$, and $(3.8\\pm1.3)$ Myr for the primary, the secondary, and the tertiary, respectively. Our evolutionary scenario predicts that the inner eclipsing binary will merge within approximately 1.7 Myr and eventually evolve into a black hole. The distance to the system, estimated from the angular size of the outer orbit is $(809.9 \\pm 1.8)$ pc, which implies that $\\delta$ Cir might be located close to the centre of a stellar population ASCC 79, a subgroup of the young Circinus complex. With a total mass of $(53.04\\pm0.29)$ M$_{\\odot}$, $\\delta$ Cir can contribute a significant fraction of the total mass of the population.",

Cinquegrana, Balázs Szányi, James M. Ball, Borbála Cseh, Mattias Ek, Amanda I. Karakas, Maria Schönbächler, John C. Lattanzio Submitted to European Physics Journal A as part of the Topical Issue on About Stars and Nuclei: Honoring the Legacy of Roberto Gallino Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Bulk meteoritic data show isotopic variability of $slow$-neutron-capture ($s$-process) origin in a several elements heavier than Fe. One peculiar feature is that the lighter $s$-process elements (e.g., Zr and Mo) present larger anomalies than the heavier $s$-process elements (e.g., Nd and W). To address this observation, we compared Zr and Nd data to model predictions of the s-process abundances at the surface of low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of initial metallicity from solar to twice solar. We found that the relative magnitude of the isotopic variability between these two elements can be matched by models of AGB stars of super-solar metallicity. The match is favoured by stronger convective overshoot, leading to a deeper dredge-up of the H-rich envelope into the He-rich region, and/or a smaller (~ half than standard) mass of the region rich in the $^{13}$C nuclei that produce free neutrons via the $^{13}$C($\\alpha$,n)$^{16}$O reaction. We conclude that nucleosynthesis in AGB stars can match the difference in the magnitude of the bulk meteoritic variations in Zr and Nd, provided that super-solar metallicity stars are the original site of these signatures. The AGB stars that produced such variations could have belonged to the current population of old, super-solar metallicity stars seen in the galactic solar neighbourhood.",

Werner Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Context. Stellar flares can significantly influence the atmospheres and habitability of orbiting exoplanets, especially around young and active M dwarfs. Understanding the temporally and spectrally resolved activity of such stars is essential for assessing their impact on planetary environments. Aims. We aim to examine in detail state-of-the-art concepts of flare models to identify what is missing in our understanding of energy deposition during the flare event. By comparing synthetic and observed flare spectra, we seek to determine the modelling frameworks best suited to represent flare energetics and spectral far-ultraviolet features while providing a foundation for investigating flare impacts on exoplanet atmospheres. Methods. In this work, we built the Young M Dwarfs Flare (YMDF) model utilising the combination of radiative-hydrodynamic (RHD) stellar atmosphere models with a high and low-energy electron beam and corresponding synthetic observables. These models are based on physical principles and were validated with solar and stellar observations. Results. The newly developed YMDF model reproduces the observed continuum rise in both the TESS photometric band and the FUV-A spectral range. Furthermore, the flare distributions generated within this framework show consistency with those observed in our sample of stars. Conclusions. We have developed the YMDF model as a tool to reproduce the time-dependent spectra of flaring young M dwarfs, providing a physically motivated description of their spectral and temporal evolution during flare events.",

While many studies on astrometric, spectroscopic, and photometric properties of BSSs in clusters have been conducted, there are few works in the literature regarding their pulsations and internal structure, which indeed can retain traces of their origin. In this work we computed and analysed a grid of collisional BSSs at low metallicity ($Z = 0.01\\; Z_\\odot$), finding that collision products present a peculiar chemical stratification that leads to periodicities in the period spacing pattern of high-order gravity modes. These seismic fingerprints provide a unique opportunity to constrain the formation pathways of BSSs in globular clusters.",

O'Grady 5 pages, 2 figures, 1 table; to be submitted to the Open Journal of Astrophysics; comments welcome! Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) HV 11417 is a candidate Thorne-Żytkow Object, a red supergiant with a neutron star core, located within the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Previous studies have questioned, using Gaia DR2 data, whether HV 11417 was truly located at the distance of the SMC or was instead a foreground star. However, the proper motion measurement uncertainties for HV 11417 in DR2 were high. In this work, we use Gaia DR3 data to show that HV 11417 is very likely to be a true member of the SMC. We further analyze the kinematics of HV 11417 relative to its local environment, and compare it to populations of massive and evolved stars in the SMC. We find HV 11417 has a local transverse velocity of $52\\pm15$ km/s, and thus qualifies as a runaway star (v$_\\mathrm{loc}\\geq$ 30 km/s). This runaway classification does not conclusively prove its nature as a TŻO, particularly given results from recent TŻO models, but does indicate that HV 11417 experienced a kinematic disruption in its evolution.",

There is too much angular momentum in a collapsing and fragmenting protostellar cloud to form a stellar binary in situ with a separation less than an AU, yet thousands of these short-period binaries have been discovered. One indication of a binary's formation is the angle between the stellar spin and orbital axes -- its obliquity. The classical method for determining projtected stellar obliquity is the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. This method has been applied to over 100 hot Jupiters, yet only a handful of stellar binaries. Of the binary systems with measured projected obliquities, even fewer have measured 3D obliquities. In this paper, we add five more short-period binary 3D obliquity measurements to the sample that previously consisted of a single system. We present Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements for EBLM J0239-20, EBLM J0941-31, EBLM 1037-25, EBLM 1141-37, and EBLM J2025-45. These systems consist of an M-dwarf eclipsing an F/G type primary. We combined CORALIE and HARPS spectroscopy with TESS photometry of primary and secondary eclipses. We show that even though the sky-projected obliquities seem to be aligned, there is modest but non-zero spin-orbit misalignment ($\\psi$ between 5 and 20$^{\\circ}$). Our primary stars straddle the Kraft break at $\\sim 6250K$. Finally, we derive the M-dwarf masses and radii to precisions better than 3\\%. With the exception of EBLM J0941-31, each system has an inflated radius greater than $5\\sigma$ from the expected radius from stellar models.",

While the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite initially designated the object as a planetary candidate, observing a 10-day transit and secondary eclipse in Sectors 8 and 35, we definitively exclude this scenario, finding instead that the transit comes from eclipsing stellar companions with $P = 9.599214$ days and $a = 0.1415$ AU. This binary orbits a single star at a wide separation of $\\rho = 0.2946''$, determined through high-resolution AO and speckle imaging and corresponding to a $\\sim$297 AU, $\\sim$1886-year orbit at a distance of 1010 pc. Using transit data and photometry, we use EXOFASTv2 to fit the transit light curve, spectral energy distribution, and MIST evolutionary models of the three stars. We find that the isolated star and the larger binary star are massive A stars, with the single star having evolved off the main sequence, while the smaller companion is a G star. We also found an unusually low rotational velocity of 2.3 km/s from the single A star, observed from MINERVA and TRES RVs, implying a pole-on orientation. The triple-star architecture derived from multiple data sources made this target a complex system that required new capabilities within EXOFASTv2 to properly model. Our successful modeling demonstrates a new paradigm for false positive identification and classification that incorporates imaging, photometry, transits, and global modeling to definitively rule out false positives that may otherwise pollute candidate catalogs without extensive follow-up observations.",

Code available at this https URL Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph) We present GANDALF, a JAX-based spectral solver for Kinetic Reduced MHD (KRMHD) turbulence designed to lower infrastructure barriers to plasma turbulence research. Existing production codes require specialized HPC infrastructure and compilation expertise, limiting participation to well-resourced institutions. GANDALF addresses this barrier by leveraging JAX's hardware abstraction to run transparently on laptops, desktop GPUs, and Apple Silicon without modification, enabling single-command installation via pip. We employ Fourier spectral methods for spatial discretization and Hermite spectral basis for velocity space, combined with an exponential integrating factor method that exactly propagates linear Alfvén waves, eliminating associated numerical stiffness. Verification demonstrates research-grade accuracy: linear Alfvén waves achieve machine precision (~10^{-15} relative error), the Orszag-Tang vortex conserves energy to 10^{-6} over two Alfvén times, and driven turbulence reproduces the expected k_perp^{-5/3} cascade spectrum. GANDALF enables rapid prototyping, parameter surveys, and educational applications on commodity hardware. The code complements rather than replaces established solvers like AstroGK and Viriato, prioritizing accessibility for researchers without HPC resources. By removing infrastructure barriers while maintaining spectral accuracy, GANDALF broadens participation in fundamental plasma turbulence research, particularly benefiting students, small research groups, and institutions in developing regions.",

As this stream was observed near the Sun, it allowed for an unparalleled opportunity to observe pristine, coronal hole wind with little evolution (expansion, stream interaction, etc) effects impacting its properties. Through an ensemble of magnetic connectivity analysis utilizing Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) modeling and ballistic propagation, we make estimates of the footpoints, and corresponding source region parameters, associated with the stream. We then look at how the low variability regions (small gradient in the in-situ $B_r$) are related to the variability in the field strength at their source ($B_0$). We find that about half of these periods are associated with low source region variability. Lastly, we examine the low $\\delta B / B$ periods between switchback patches and similarly find that they show statistically less variability in their associated $B_0$ value than their switchback patch counterparts. We believe that these results point to a solar source of these ``low-variability\" periods, that warrants further investigation with composition diagnostics and more complex modeling techniques.",

Appendix. Accepted to Astronomy and Astrophysics; further comments and questions welcome Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) High-resolution, near-infrared observations have revealed prominent, two-armed spirals in a multitude of systems, such as MWC~758, SAO~206462, and V1247~Ori. Alongside the classical theory of disk-companion interaction, shadow-based driving has come into vogue as a potential explanation for such large-scale substructures. How might these two mechanisms be distinguished from one another in observations? To investigate this question, we ran a pair of hydrodynamical simulations with \\texttt{PLUTO}. One, with full radiation hydrodynamics and gas-grain collision, was designed to develop shadow-driven spirals at the outer gap edge of a sub-thermal, Saturn-mass planet. The other, with parametrized $\\beta$-cooling, was set up to capture the more standard view of spiral wave excitation by a super-thermal, multi-Jupiter-mass, exterior planetary companion. Post-processing of these simulations with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) code \\texttt{RADMC3D} revealed that strong vertical velocities in the shadow-driven case create a prominent two-armed feature in the moment-1 CO maps, particularly when the disk is viewed face-on in optically thicker isotopologues; such a feature is not seen in the standard planet-driven case. Conversely, the presence or absence of such signatures in two-armed spiral systems would distinguish those potentially driven by exterior, multi-Jupiter-mass companions, and thus help identify promising targets for future direct-imaging campaigns.",

We derive elemental abundances and temperature-pressure ($T$-$P$) profiles while explicitly testing the robustness of the results against major sources of systematic uncertainty. We first perform retrievals with a power-law $T$-$P$ profile and assess the sensitivity of inferred molecular abundances and C/O ratios to different CO line lists (ExoMol, HITEMP with air- and H2-broadening). We then introduce a flexible Gaussian process-based $T$-$P$ profile, allowing a non-parametric characterization of the thermal structure and a more conservative treatment of uncertainties. For both components, we infer C/O ratios of about 0.67, slightly above solar, with line list systematics at the 7 percent level emerging as the dominant source of uncertainty, whereas assumptions about $T$-$P$ parameterization or photometric variability play a lesser role. The retrieved $T$-$P$ profiles and molecular abundances are broadly consistent with atmospheric models and equilibrium chemistry. Our results establish Luhman 16AB as a key anchor for substellar C/O measurements, demonstrate the utility of flexible $T$-$P$ modeling in high-resolution retrievals, and highlight the importance of systematic tests -- particularly line list uncertainties -- for robust comparisons between brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets.",

VHS 1256B, the most variable known planet-mass object, exhibits a near-infrared flux change of nearly 40%, with red color and silicate features revealed in recent JWST spectra, challenging current theories. Using a general circulation model, we demonstrate that VHS 1256B's atmosphere is dominated by planetary-scale dust storms persisting for tens of days, with large patchy clouds propagating with equatorial waves. This weather pattern, distinct from the banded structures seen on solar system giants, simultaneously explains the observed spectra and critical features in the rotational light curves, including the large amplitude, irregular evolution, and wavelength dependence, as well as the variability trends observed in near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams of dusty substellar atmospheres.",

However, modeling uncertainties are often overlooked, even as they can rival or exceed observational uncertainties. In this study, we quantify, for the first time, the impact of structural resolution choices in 1D stellar evolution calculations on predicted $p$-mode frequencies across the HR diagram, using \\texttt{MESA} and \\texttt{GYRE}. We present demonstrative measurements of resolution-based modeling uncertainty for a range of solar-like, upper main-sequence, and Mira oscillators and compare these directly to \\TESS{} observational uncertainties. We demonstrate that resolution-driven uncertainties can significantly influence theoretical predictions and in some cases overwhelm observational uncertainties by orders of magnitude. For the illustrative case considered -- an order-of-magnitude variation in mesh resolution -- solar-like oscillators typically have fractional, resolution-based uncertainties at or below 1\\% of the test frequency. Fractional uncertainties in Miras, however, are as large as 20\\%. We also find that the location and morphology of the RGB bump and red clump are impacted substantially by resolution uncertainty. Stellar ages are impacted at the 10\\% level for young main-sequence stars, and the model-based correction factor for the $\\Dnu{}$--$\\sqrt{\\rho}$ scaling relation is impacted at the 2\\% level. Our results underscore the need to incorporate modeling uncertainties into asteroseismic analyses and provide a reference framework for observers evaluating the reliability of theoretical models.",

Toonen, F. Dosopoulou, E. Laplace Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Mass transfer (MT) is a fundamental process in stellar evolution. While MT in circular orbits is well studied, observations indicate that it also occurs in eccentric ones, where theoretical models are limited. We present a new semi-analytic framework for the secular orbital evolution of mass-transferring binaries, treating stars either as point-masses or as extended bodies. For the first time, a MT model is applicable to both circular and eccentric orbits and accommodates conservative and non-conservative MT across a broad range of mass ratios and stellar spins. We derive secular, orbit-averaged equations describing the orbital evolution by treating MT, mass loss, and angular momentum (AM) loss as perturbations to the general two-body problem. Assuming conservative MT, we compare our results to previous models and validate them against numerical integrations. Our model predicts eccentric post-MT systems in wider orbits than classical results. Compared to other eccentric MT frameworks we find a broader parameter space for orbital widening and eccentricity pumping. Accounting for extended bodies yields stronger semimajor axis and eccentricity growth at a given mass ratio, and further broadens the parameter space for orbital widening and eccentricity pumping. Whether extended bodies are considered or not, eccentric MT naturally predicts higher eccentricities at longer orbital periods, a correlation observed in numerous post-MT systems, providing a robust mechanism for their formation. Our model can be integrated into binary evolution and population synthesis codes to consistently treat conservative and non-conservative MT in arbitrarily eccentric orbits with applications ranging from MT on the main sequence to gravitational-wave progenitors.",

The weak s-process nucleosynthesis is driven by neutrons produced in the 22Ne({\\alpha}, n)25Mg reaction during convective He-core and C-shell burning. The yields of heavy elements thus depend on the 22Ne({\\alpha}, n)25Mg and the competitive 22Ne({\\alpha}, {\\gamma})26Mg reaction rates which are dominated by several narrow-resonance reactions. While the accuracy of these rates has been under debate for decades, recent experimental efforts, including ours, drastically reduced these uncertainties. In this work, we use a set of 280 massive star nucleosynthesis models calculated using different 22Ne({\\alpha}, n)25Mg and 22Ne({\\alpha}, {\\gamma})26Mg rates, and a galactic chemical evolution (GCE) study to probe their impact on the weak s-process elemental abundances in the Galaxy. The GCE was computed with the OMEGA+ code, using the new sets of stellar yields with different 22Ne+{\\alpha} rates. From GCE, we find that these rates are causing up to 0.45 dex of variations in the [Cu/Fe], [Ga/Fe], and [Ge/Fe] ratios predicted at solar metallicity. The greatest impact on the stellar nucleosynthesis and GCE results derives from uncertainties in the ({\\alpha},n) strength ({\\omega}{\\gamma}({\\alpha},n)) of the Ex=11.32 MeV resonance. We show that the variations observed in the GCE calculations for the weak s-proess elements become negligibly smaller than dispersions found in observations once the {\\omega}{\\gamma}({\\alpha},n) is accurately determined within the uncertaintiy of 10 to 20% (typically reported experimental errors for the resonance) in future nuclear physics experiments.",

Fernández-Trincado, Keivan G. Stassun, Julio Chanamé Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Recent Gaia-based young stellar association surveys have revealed dozens of low-mass populations that have, until recently, been too small or sparse to detect. These populations represent a largely unstudied demographic with unknown origins, and their relative isolation may minimize gravitational disruptions that impact traceback, making them compelling targets for dynamical studies. In this paper, we survey 15 of these isolated young associations for the first time: Andromeda South (SCYA-97), Aquila East, Aries South (SCYA-104), Cassiopeia East (SCYA-43), Canis Major North, Leo Central (SCYA-2), Leo East (SCYA-3), Theia 72, Ophiuchus Southeast, Scutum North (SCYA-70), Taurus-Orion 1 (TOR1), Theia 78, Vulpecula East (UPK 88), SCYA-54, and SCYA-79. By combining Gaia astrometry and photometry with new ground-based spectroscopic measurements, we assess the membership of each population, search for substructure, analyze their demographics, and compute ages. We find that the smallest populations in our sample contain $<20$ $M_{\\odot}$ of stellar mass, making them the smallest associations ever detected. Four host substantial substructure, including TOR1, where we discover TOR1B, a new 16 $M_{\\odot}$ association with radial velocities inconsistent with an origin in the parent complex. Using PARSEC isochrones, we produce self-consistent ages for all populations supported by dynamical and lithium depletion ages, which range from 6.9 $\\pm$ 0.5 Myr in TOR1A to 42.8 $\\pm$ 2.4 in AndS. Our results provide the first detailed overview of the properties of these populations, characterizing a largely unknown category of young associations that may have an important role in tracing the processes that guide local star formation.",

Liu, Chuanpeng Hou Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) Turbulence is a ubiquitous process that transfers energy across many spatial and temporal scales, thereby influencing particle transport and heating. Recent progress has improved our understanding of the anisotropy of turbulence with respect to the mean magnetic field; however, its exact form and implications for magnetic topology and energy transfer remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the nature of magnetic anisotropy in compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence within low-$\\beta$ solar wind using measurements from the Cluster spacecraft. By decomposing small-amplitude fluctuations into Alfvén and compressible modes, we reveal that magnetic anisotropy is largely mode dependent: Alfvenic fluctuations are broadly distributed in propagation angle, whereas compressible fluctuations are concentrated near the quasi-parallel (slab) direction, a feature closely linked to collisionless damping of compressible modes. For $\\beta\\rightarrow0$, compressible modes become dominant within the slab component at smaller scales. These findings advance our understanding of magnetic anisotropy in solar wind turbulence and offer a new perspective on the three-dimensional turbulence cascade, with broad implications for particle transport, acceleration, and magnetic reconnection.",

The primary objective of this study is to elucidate the capabilities of our pipeline in the context of recovering the intrinsic profiles and associated parameters, such as dispersion measure, frequency scaling index, scattering time, pulse broadening function, and time of arrival residuals. We use simulated profiles to rigorously test and validate the efficiency of our recovery pipeline. These simulated profiles encompass single and multi-component Gaussians, designed to emulate the diverse nature of pulsar profiles. By comparing the recovered profiles and parameters to their injected values, as derived from simulations, we provide a robust evaluation of the pipeline's performance along with its drawbacks and limitations.",

Whittam Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will enable astronomers to discover rare and distant astrophysical transients. Host-galaxy association is crucial for selecting the most scientifically interesting transients for follow-up. LSST Deep Drilling Field observations will detect distant transients occurring in galaxies below the detection limits of most all-sky catalogues. Here we investigate the use of pre-existing smaller-scale, field-specific catalogues for host identification in the Deep Drilling Fields (DDFs) and a ranking of their usefulness. We have compiled a database of 70 deep catalogues that overlap with the Rubin DDFs and constructed thin catalogues to be homogenised and combined for transient-host matching. A systematic ranking of their utility is discussed and applied based on the inclusion of information such as spectroscopic redshifts and morphological information. Utilising this data against a Dark Energy Survey (DES) sample of supernovae with pre-identified hosts in the XMM-LSS and ECDFS fields, we evaluate different methods for transient-host association in terms of both accuracy and processing speed. We also apply light data-cleaning techniques to identify and remove contaminants within our associations, such as diffraction spikes and blended galaxies where the correct host cannot be determined with confidence. We use a lightweight machine learning approach in the form of extreme gradient boosting to generate confidence scores in our contaminant selections and associated metrics. Finally, we discuss the computational expense of implementation within the LSST transient alert brokers, which will require efficient, fast-paced processing to handle the large stream of survey data.",

To study these dynamics, we require high-resolution, photometrically calibrated observations. Over the last 9 years, the Juno spacecraft's optical camera, JunoCam, has generated a unique dataset with high spatial resolution, wide coverage during perijove passes, and a long baseline. However, JunoCam lacks absolute photometric calibration, hindering quantitative analysis of the Jovian atmosphere. Using observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as a proxy for a calibrated sensor, we present a novel method for performing unpaired image-to-image translation (I2I) between JunoCam and HST, focusing on addressing the resolution discrepancy between the two sensors. Our structure-preserving I2I method, SP-I2I, incorporates explicit frequency-space constraints designed to preserve high-frequency features ensuring the retention of fine, small-scale spatial structures - essential for studying Jupiter's atmosphere. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art unpaired image-to-image translation methods are inadequate to address this problem, and, importantly, we show the broader impact of our proposed solution on relevant remote sensing data for the pansharpening task.",

Submitted to MNRAS, along with \"Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO): Options for robust Deep Spectral Line Imaging in the SKA-Era\", which is on arxiv as https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2511.17307 Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The next generation of radio astronomy telescopes are challenging existing data analysis paradigms, as they have an order of magnitude more antennas and larger bandwidth. Foremost amongst these are deep spectral line surveys, because these have the largest number of epochs and spectral channels per dataset. For example, the Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO) project on the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) aims to observe over 3,000 hours spread over hundreds of observing sessions, covering two pointings and two frequency settings. The two primary problems encountered when processing this data are the need for storage and that processing is primarily I/O limited. To address these issues, we have implemented an deep imaging pipeline based on the storage of an intermediate data product in the software ASKAPSoft, that of the uv-gridded data, and have demonstrated lossy and lossless compression of this data on ASKAP, using MGARD and ADIOS2 libraries. We find data compression ratios from a factor of 7 (lossless) up to 20 (using lossy compression with an absolute error bound of $10^{-4}$), and processing is faster by a factor of 7 for lossless compression. We discuss the effectiveness of lossy MGARD compression and its adherence to the designated error bounds, the trade-off between these error bounds and the corresponding compression ratios, as well as the potential consequences of these I/O and storage improvements on the science quality of the data products.",

      "abstract": "A Less Terrifying Universe? Mundanity as an Explanation for the Fermi Paradox Robin H.D. Corbet Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics. 10 pages, 1 figure Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Applying a principle of \"radical mundanity\", this paper examines explanations for the lack of strong evidence for the presence of technology-using extraterrestrial civilizations (ETCs) in the Galaxy - the Fermi paradox. With this principle, the prospect that the Galaxy contains a modest number of civilizations is preferred, where none have achieved technology levels sufficient to accomplish large-scale astro-engineering or lack the desire to do so. This consideration also leads to the expectation that no ETC will colonize a large fraction of the Galaxy, even using robotic probes, and that there are no long-duration high-power beacons. However, there is a reasonable chance that we may make contact on a short, by historical standards, timescale. This event would be momentous, but could still leave us slightly disappointed. Such a Universe would be less terrifying than either of the two possibilities in the quote generally attributed to Arthur C. Clarke on whether we are alone or not. Also, if there is a modest number of ETCs in the Galaxy, that would suggest that there is a large number of planets with some form of life.",

      "abstract": "Measurements of the Birks' coefficient of GAGG:Ce using hard X-rays Merlin Kole, Nicolas De Angelis Accepted for publication in NIM A Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det) Inorganic scintillators continue to be widely used within astrophysical X-ray and gamma-ray detectors. This is in part thanks to the development of new scintillators, such as GAGG:Ce, as well as the availability of new scintillator readout sensors such as Silicon Photomultipliers and Silicon Drift Detectors. In order to use such scintillator materials for spectrometry or polarimetry, a detailed understanding of their response is important. One parameter that can affect the scintillator performance, particularly at lower photon energies, is their Birks' coefficient, which correlates the relative light yield to the ionization energy density. While for many high-Z inorganic scintillators this effect can be ignored, for GAGG:Ce this appears to not be the case. Here we provide a measurement of the Birks' coefficient for GAGG:Ce using data from a detector irradiated in the 20-80~keV energy range at the LARIX-A X-ray beam in Ferrara, Italy. While the effects due to Birks' law are visible below 30 keV, they also significantly influence the performance of GAGG:Ce performance near one of the K-edges, affecting both the measured gain and the energy resolution. Here, we use beam test data to derive the Birks' coefficient from GAGG:Ce. The results indicate that for usage in hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray missions, this coefficient has a significant effect on the measurements.",

Wilson, Kevin France Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Context. Neptune-sized exoplanets or exo-Neptunes are fundamental in the description of exoplanet diversity. Their evolution is sculpted by atmospheric escape, often traced by absorption in the H i Lyman-{\\alpha} line at 1,216 Å and the He i triplet line at 1.08 {\\mu}m. On warm exo-Neptunes HAT-P-11 b, GJ 3470 b and GJ 436 b, H i Lyman-{\\alpha} absorption causes extreme in-transit obscuration of their host stars. This suggests that He i triplet line absorption will also be strong, yet it has only been identified on two of these planets. Aims. We explore previously unaccounted for processes that might attenuate the He i triplet line on warm exo-Neptunes. In particular, we assess the role of vibrationally excited H2 to remove the He+ ion that acts as precursor of the absorbing He(2$^3$S ). Methods. We formed thermal rate coefficients for this chemical process, leveraging the available theoretical and experimental data. The process becomes notably fast at the temperatures expected in the atmospheric layers probed by the He i triplet line. Results. Our simulations show that the proposed process severely mutes the line on GJ 3470 b and causes the nondetection on GJ 436 b. The overall efficiency of this mechanism is connected to where in the atmosphere the H2-to-H transition occurs and, ultimately, to the amount of high-energy radiation received by the planet. The process will be more significant on small exoplanets than on hotter or more massive ones, as for the latter the H2-to-H transition generally occurs deeper in the atmosphere. Conclusions. Weak He i triplet line absorption need not imply the lack of a primordial, H2-He-dominated atmosphere, an idea to bear in mind when interpreting the observations of other small exoplanets.",

Brown 11 pages, 1 table, 6 figures, published in PSJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We present observations of two binary systems within the cold classical region of the Kuiper belt$-$2001 XR254 and 2016 BP81$-$obtained with the JWST Near-Infrared Spectrograph. The measured reflectance spectrum of 2001 XR254 is characteristic of the red cold classicals, with strong features due to carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methanol ices. In contrast, 2016 BP81 is a blue binary, with a water-ice-rich surface composition. The two components of the 2016 BP81 binary display identical spectral profiles, consistent with coeval formation from gravitational collapse. Through qualitative and quantitative comparisons of water-ice-rich Kuiper belt objects observed with JWST, we identify a small subclass, including 2016 BP81, that appears to differ in systematic ways from the rest of the population. The relatively deep carbon dioxide ice absorption bands and enhanced signatures of aliphatic organics suggest that objects within this subclass may have originated in a distinct formation environment from the other water-ice-rich Kuiper belt objects. The implications of our findings are discussed within the context of recent models of Kuiper belt formation and evolution.",

Accepted from publication in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Sub-Neptunes are absent in the Solar System, yet they are commonly found in our Galaxy. They challenge the internal structure models and prompt investigation on their formation, evolution, and atmospheres. We report the characterisation of new sub-Neptunes orbiting two similar M dwarfs, TOI-521 (T_eff=3544 K), and TOI-912 (T_eff=3572 K). Both stars host a candidate identified by TESS and are part of the THIRSTEE follow-up program, which aims at understanding the sub-Neptune population through precise characterisation studies on a population level. We analysed light curves, ground-based photometry and ESPRESSO, HARPS and IRD RVs to infer precise orbital and physical parameters. The two stars host nearly identical planets in terms of mass and radius. TOI-521 b is a transiting sub-Neptune in a 1.5-d orbit with radius and mass of R=1.98+/-0.14 R_e and M=5.3+/-1.0 M_e respectively. Moreover, we identified an additional candidate at 20.3 d, with a minimum mass of Msini=10.7+/-2.4 M_e currently not detected to transit. Similarly, TOI-912 b is a 4.7-d sub-Neptune with R=1.93+/-0.13 R_e and M=5.1+/-0.5 M_e. Interestingly, TOI-912 b likely has an unusually high eccentricity (e=0.58+/-0.02), and it is probably undergoing strong tidal dissipation. If such eccentricity is confirmed, it would make it one of the most eccentric sub-Neptunes known to date. TOI-521 b and TOI-912 b have very similar densities (4 g/cm^3) and they lie in the degenerate region of the mass-radius diagram where different compositions are plausible, including a volatile-rich composition, or a rocky core surrounded by a H-He envelope. Our sample supports the division of sub-Neptunes into two distinct populations divided by a density gap. Both planets are interesting targets for atmospheric follow-up in the context of understanding the temperature-atmospheric feature trend that starts to emerge thanks to JWST observations.",

While one-dimensional (1D) atmospheric models with 1D radiative transfer (RT) have been widely used, advances in three-dimensional (3D) general circulation models (GCMs) and 3D RT methods now allow quantitative comparisons of these approaches. With the precision and sensitivity of JWST, such differences can be observationally tested. This study investigates the spectral variations produced by 1D and 3D models and estimates the JWST observing time or number of transits needed to distinguish them. Using HD 189733b as a case study, three sets of simulations were performed: 1D atmospheric models with 1D RT and 3D GCM models coupled with both 1D and 3D RT. An inherent limitation of our study is that the temperature-pressure (T-P) profiles derived from the 3D GCM extend only to the high-pressure regions. The simulations incorporated both equilibrium and disequilibrium chemistry. Significant spectral discrepancies were found, with 3D models generally showing weaker features. Using a JWST noise simulator, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for detecting these differences was calculated. For transmission spectra, the SNR ranged from 2.04-7.68 (equilibrium) and 1.66-7.04 (disequilibrium), while for emission spectra it ranged from 5.90-34.52 (equilibrium) and 7.11-36.93 (disequilibrium). To test the limitations of the 3D GCM, we extended the atmosphere to lower pressures using an isothermal T-P profile and found wavelength-dependent variations in both the spectra and the SNR. These results show that JWST can distinguish 1D from 3D model spectra for major molecular features, underscoring the importance of 3D modeling in interpreting exoplanetary atmospheres.",
