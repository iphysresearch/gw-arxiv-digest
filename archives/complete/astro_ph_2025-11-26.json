Font Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Deep-learning methods are becoming increasingly important in gravitational-wave data analysis, yet their performance often relies on large training datasets and models whose internal representations are difficult to interpret. Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) offers a complementary approach: it performs well in scarce-data regimes and yields physically interpretable representations of gravitational-wave morphology. Here we present CLAWDIA (Comprehensive Library for the Analysis of Waves via Dictionary-based Algorithms), an open-source Python framework that integrates SDL-based denoising and classification under realistic detector noise. We systematise previously isolated SDL workflows into a unified, modular environment with a consistent, user-friendly interface. The current release provides several time-domain denoising strategies based on LASSO-regularised sparse coding and a classifier based on Low-Rank Shared Dictionary Learning. A companion toolbox, GWADAMA, supports dataset construction and realistic conditioning of real and simulated interferometer data. We demonstrate CLAWDIA's performance by denoising the signal from binary neutron star event GW170817 and by classifying families of instrumental glitches from LIGO's third observing run, highlighting robustness at low signal-to-noise ratios. CLAWDIA is intended as a community-driven, interoperable library extensible to additional tasks, including detection and parameter estimation.",

Takahashi, Tomohisa Kawashima, Ken Ohsuga 12 pages, 12 figures, accepted by PASJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) By investigating the time-variable 230 GHz images using ray-tracing general relativistic radiative transfer calculation, we propose a novel method for estimating the spin parameter of the supermassive black hole at the M87 center by utilizing the sudden and short-term increase in emissivity in the innermost region of the accretion disk. It is found that the flux of the photon ring increases simultaneously as the flux of the direct ring, which brightens first, decreases, and then gradually diminishes, when the increase in emissivity persists for $15 t_{\\rm g}$ with $t_{\\rm g}$ being the light crossing time of the gravitational radius. The direct ring is formed by photons emitted from the vicinity of the innermost region of the disk and traveling directly to the observer without orbiting around the black hole, while the photon ring is formed by photons passing near the spherical photon orbit. The time-averaged width of the dark region between the direct ring and the photon ring (dark crescent) becomes thinner when the spin parameter is higher and the increase in the emissivity of the accretion disk is greater. The time variation of two rings also causes the intensity-weighted center to oscillate both in the direction of the black hole's angular momentum vector projected onto the screen ($Y$-direction) and in the perpendicular direction ($X$-direction). The amplitude of oscillatory time variation in the $X$-direction becomes large when the spin parameter is higher, and that in the $Y$-direction becomes large when the increase in the emissivity of the disk is large. The spin parameter can be estimated by combining the time-averaged dark crescent width and the ratio of the amplitudes in the $X$- and $Y$-directions. This method is applicable when the duration of the increase in emissivity of the accretion disk ranges at least from approximately 10-20 $t_{\\rm g}$.",

Yet the great observatories of today, LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and the planned Einstein Telescope, rest on Michelson interferometers that, despite their triumphs, confront fundamental barriers of scale, cost, and environmental vulnerability. We envision a new path, a Sagnac-based fiber interferometer that leverages reciprocity and inherent robustness. Its meter-scale, modular design compact enough to fit within a small facility, offers dramatic gains in scalability and affordability over kilometer scale Michelson systems. Tunable to frequency bands where conventional detectors lose sensitivity, it opens the door to compact, versatile, and accessible GW observatories, empowering universities and research centers worldwide. Linked together in a global network, such facilities could transcend mere detection, they could localize cosmic sources and reconstruct them into images, much as black holes were first directly revealed, ushering in a new era of gravitational-wave astronomy and multi-messenger discovery.",

While $\\Lambda$CDM provides a good fit to the observational data, evolving dark energy scenarios, such as the CPL parametrization, offer a compelling alternative. In this paper, we present a Bayesian model comparison of various dark energy parametrizations using a joint analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background data, DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements, and the PantheonPlus (or Union3) Supernovae type Ia sample. We find that while the $\\Lambda$CDM model is initially favored over a constant $w$CDM model, the CPL parametrization is significantly preferred over $w$CDM, reinforcing recent evidence for an evolving dark energy component, consistent with DESI collaboration findings. Crucially, when testing higher-order CPL extensions, the so-called CPL$^+$ and CPL$^{++}$, our Bayesian analysis shows that the observational data do not favor these more complex scenarios compared to the standard CPL. This result indicates that adding excessive complexity to the CPL form is unwarranted by current observations. Interestingly, similar to the CPL parametrization, alternative two-parameter forms, specifically $w_{de}(a) = w_0 + w_b(1-a)^2$ and $w_{de}(a) = w_0 + w_c(1-a)^3$, yield a better fit to observational data than the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Our results challenge the necessity for overly complex CPL extensions and confirm that well-chosen two-parameter $w_0w_a$ parametrizations effectively capture DE evolution with current cosmological data, supporting the recent signals for dynamical dark energy by DESI collaboration.",

Submitted to Phys Rev D Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) To efficiently probe primordial non-Gaussianity using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, we require theoretical predictions that are factorizable, \\textit{i.e.}\\ those whose kinematic dependence can be separated. This property does not hold for many models, hindering their application to data. In this work, we introduce a general framework for constructing separable approximations to primordial bispectra, enabling direct CMB constraints on arbitrary models including those computed using numerical tools. In contrast to other approaches such as modal decompositions, we learn the basis functions directly from the data, allowing high-fidelity representations with just a handful of terms. This is practically implemented using machine-learning techniques, utilizing neural network basis functions and a loss function designed to mimic the CMB cosine similarity. We validate our pipeline using a variety of input bispectra, demonstrating that the approximations are $>99.5\\%$ correlated with the truth with just three terms. By incorporating the neural basis into the \\textsc{PolySpec} code, we derive KSW-type CMB estimators, which reproduce local- and equilateral-type non-Gaussianity to within $0.1\\sigma$. As a proof-of-concept, we constrain two inflationary bispectra from the `cosmological collider' scenario; these feature an additional strongly-mixed particle sector and cannot be computed analytically. By combining the numerical predictions from \\textsc{CosmoFlow} with our factorizable approach (with just three terms), we place novel constraints on the collider models using \\textit{Planck} PR4 data, finding no detection of non-Gaussianity. Our method facilitates detailed studies of the inflationary paradigm, connecting modern theoretical tools with high-resolution observational data.",

Observations of GW190814 and GW230529 highlight the challenges gravitational waves face in distinguishing neutron stars from black holes. Interpreting these systems is especially difficult because classifications depend simultaneously on measurement noise, compact binary population models, and equation of state (EOS) constraints on the maximum neutron star mass. We analyze 66 confident events from GWTC-3 to quantify how the probability of a component being a neutron star, P(NS), varies across the population. The effects are substantial, the dominant drivers of classification are the pairing preferences of neutron stars with other compact objects, and the neutron star spin distributions. The data reveals that P(NS) varies between 1% - 67% for GW230529's primary and between 51% - 100% for GW190425's primary. By contrast, P(NS) for GW190814's secondary varies by <10%, demonstrating robustness from its high signal-to-noise ratio and small mass ratio. Analysis using EOS information tends to affect P(NS) through the inferred maximum neutron star mass rather than the maximum spin. As it stands, P(NS) remains sensitive to numerous population parameters, limiting its reliability and potentially leading to ambiguous classifications of future GW events.",

New version adds missing reference Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) For most of cosmic history, the evolution of our Universe has been governed by the physics of a 'dark sector', consisting of dark matter and dark energy, whose properties are only understood in a schematic way. The influence of these constituents is mediated exclusively by the force of gravity, meaning that insight into their nature must be gleaned from gravitational phenomena. The advent of gravitational-wave astronomy has revolutionised the field of black hole astrophysics, and opens a new window of discovery for cosmological sources. Relevant examples include topological defects, such as domain walls or cosmic strings, which are remnants of a phase transition. Here we present the first simulations of cosmic structure formation in which the dynamics of the dark sector introduces domain walls as a source of stochastic gravitational waves in the late Universe. We study in detail how the spectrum of gravitational waves is affected by the properties of the model, and extrapolate the results to scales relevant to the recent evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background. Our relativistic implementation of the field dynamics paves the way for optimal use of the next generation of gravitational experiments to unravel the dark sector.",

We used a residual neural network (ResNet50) to perform multi-class classification of image samples constructed from time-frequency Morlet wavelet scalograms. We defined a three-class problem by categorizing the HFF slope as Steep, Moderate, or Low, according to physically informed ranges. The ResNet50 model was optimized with phenomenological waveforms injected into real noise from the LIGO-Virgo O3b observing run and then tested with numerically simulated CCSN waveforms embedded in the same real noise. At galactic distances of 1 kpc and 5 kpc with H1 and L1 data and 1 kpc with V1 data, we obtained highly accurate results (test accuracies from 0.8933 to 0.9867), which show the feasibility of our methodology. For further distances, we observed declines in test accuracy until 0.8000 with H1 and L1 data at 10 kpc and until 0.5933 with V1 data at 10 kpc, which we attribute to limitations in the input datasets. Our methodology is sufficiently general to enable early-stage characterization of the HFF in real interferometric data.",

This dark matter candidate condenses into dense, solitonic cores, and, if a super-massive black hole is present at the centre of such a core, its central part forms a `gravitational atom'. Here, we calculate the atom's contribution to the gravitational potential felt by a Galactic-centre star, for a general state of the atom. We study the angular-momentum dynamics this potential induces, and show that it is similar to vector resonant relaxation. Its influence is found to be potentially sufficiently strong that such a dynamical component should be accounted for in Galactic-centre modelling. For the Milky Way, the atom is expected to have some spherical asymmetry, and we use this to derive a stability condition for the disc of young, massive stars at the Galactic centre - if the atom's mass is too large, then the disc would be destroyed. Thus, the existence of this disc constrains the mass of the particles comprising the solitonic core. We study an example model of the core, where all of the rotation of the core's inner region is assumed to come from an $l=1$ state, and its amplitude is determined by the halo's spin parameter; such a core is found to be in tension with the stability of the clockwise stellar disc for $4.2\\times 10^{-20}\\,\\textrm{eV} \\leq m_a \\leq 5.4\\times 10^{-20}\\,\\textrm{eV}$ at $2\\sigma$.

These properties facilitate them to be standardized candles for the determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) within late-time universe cosmology. Nevertheless, a statistically significant difference persists between $H_0$ values derived from early and late-time measurements, a phenomenon known as the Hubble tension. Furthermore, recent observations have identified a subset of over-luminous SNe\\,Ia, characterized by peak luminosities exceeding the nominal range and faster decline rates. These discoveries raise questions regarding the reliability of SNe\\,Ia as standard candles for measuring cosmological distances. In this article, we present the Bayesian analysis of 15 over-luminous SNe\\,Ia and show that they yield a lower $H_0$ estimate due to the increase in their absolute magnitude.

Macpherson, Asta Heinesen 20 pages, 11 figures, Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Cosmography is a widely applied method to infer kinematics of the Universe at small cosmological scales while remaining agnostic about the theory of gravity at play. Usually cosmologists invoke the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric in cosmographic analyses, however generalised approaches allow for analyses outside of any assumed geometrical model. These methods have great promise to be able to model-independently map the cosmic neighborhood where the Universe has not yet converged to isotropy. In this regime, anisotropies can bias parameter inferences if they are not accounted for, and thus must be included for precision cosmology analyses, even when the principle aim is to infer the background cosmology. In this paper, we develop a method to predict the dipole in luminosity distances that arises due to nearby inhomogeneities. This is the leading-order correction to the standard isotropic distance-redshift law. Within a very broad class of general-relativistic universe models, we provide an interpretation of the dipole in terms of the gradients in expansion rate and density which is free from any underlying background cosmology. We use numerical relativity simulations, with improved initial data methods, alongside fully relativistic ray tracing to test the power of our prediction. We find our prediction accurately captures the dipole signature in our simulations to within ~10% for redshifts $z\\lesssim 0.07$ in reasonably smooth simulations. In the presence of more non-linear density fields, we find this reduces to $z\\lesssim 0.02$. This represents up to an order of magnitude improvement with respect to what is achieved by naive, local cosmography-based predictions. Our paper thus addresses important issues regarding convergence properties of anisotropic cosmographic series expansions that would otherwise limit their applicability to very narrow redshift ranges.",

Phys. 11 (2025) 078 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Recent observations of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, when combined with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), provide compelling evidence for a phantom crossing at late times, along with statistically significant deviations from the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we investigate the role of redshift-space galaxy clustering data by employing the pre-reconstruction full-shape (FS) galaxy power spectrum from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) data release 12 (DR12) sample. This dataset is analyzed in combination with BAO measurements from DESI data release 2 (DR2) and various SNIa samples. Our analysis demonstrates that the joint combination of these datasets can yield deviations from $\\Lambda$CDM at a significance level of up to $\\sim 5\\sigma$, suggesting strong indications that the dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$ may have crossed the phantom divide ($w = -1$) in the redshift range $z \\sim 0.4$-$0.5$. The precise location and strength of this crossing depend on the adopted theoretical parameterizations. Importantly, our results reveal that this trend persists even in the absence of CMB data, underscoring the robustness of the FS power spectrum as a powerful and independent probe for testing dark energy models and for distinguishing between competing cosmological scenarios.",

Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\\Gamma \\equiv \\log_{10}\\sqrt{G/G_{\\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\\rm N}>10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$, while it is $\\Gamma=0.134_{-0.036}^{+0.056}$ (thermal prior on eccentricity) or $0.115_{-0.028}^{+0.048}$ (flat prior) for 8 binaries with $g_{\\rm N}<10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$. The $>3.7\\sigma$ discrepancy with Newton is significantly contributed by one system whose relative 3D velocity between the pair exceeds the Newtonian escape velocity. This system is not likely to be a chance association but may be consistent with modified gravity. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring gravity at low acceleration with future samples of wide binaries.",

This allows for black hole evolutionary tracks as a function of redshift, combining formation, accretion, and merger histories for the variety of black hole populations. A realistic black hole continuum constructed from initial mass and spin functions and approximate redshift evolution reveals possible black hole main sequences, such as sustained coherent accretion through cosmic time or hierarchical merger trees. In the stellar-mass regime, we use a binary population synthesis software to compare three spin prescriptions for tidal evolution of Wolf-Rayet progenitors, showing how the mass--spin diagram exposes interesting modeling differences. We then classify black hole populations by applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to mass--spin datasets. While bare unsupervised clustering can nearly recover canonical population boundaries (stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive), a more sophisticated approach utilizing deep learning via variational autoencoders for latent space representation learning aids in clustering of realistic datasets with subclasses that highly overlap in mass--spin space. We find that a supervised random forest can accurately recover the correct clusters from the learned latent space representation depending on the complexity of the underlying dataset, semi-supervised methods show potential for further development, and the performance of unsupervised classifiers is a great challenge. Our findings motivate future machine learning applications and demonstrate that the mass--spin diagram can be used to connect gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations with theoretical models.",

By tuning the parameters of our model, we analyze the Coleman-de Luccia (CDL) and Hawking-Moss (HM) process, finding that the corresponding mass function of PBHs is sharply peaked, implying that we can realize either PBHs as cold dark matter, sub-solar PBHs, or supermassive PBHs in this scenario without enhancement of primordial curvature perturbations.",

Keenan, Carlo Schimd 12 pages, 8 figures, submitted to A&A Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Helium reionization is the most recent phase change of the intergalactic medium, yet its timing and main drivers remain uncertain. Among the probes to trace its unfolding, the 3.46 cm hyperfine line of singly-ionized helium opens the study of helium reionization to upcoming radio surveys. We aim to evaluate the detectability of the 3.46,cm signal with radio surveys and the possible constraints it can place on helium reionization, in particular whether it can distinguish between early and late helium reionization scenarios. Moreover, we perform a comprehensive study of the advantages of single-dish vs. interferometric setup. Using hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with radiative transfer, we construct mock data cubes for two models of helium reionization. We compute the power spectrum of the signal and forecast the signal-to-noise ratio for SKA-1 MID, DSA-2000, and a PUMA-like survey, in both observational setups. The two scenarios produce distinct power spectra, but the faintness of the signal, largely caused by weak coupling between the spin temperature and the kinetic temperature in low-density regions of the IGM, combined with high instrumental noise, makes detection very difficult within realistic integration times for current surveys. A PUMA-like survey operating in single-dish mode could, however, detect the 3.46 cm signal with an integrated signal-to-noise ratio of a few in < 1000 h in both scenarios. Distinguishing helium reionization scenarios with 3.46 cm line-intensity mapping therefore remains challenging for current facilities. Our results, however, indicate that next-generation, high-sensitivity surveys with optimized observing strategies, especially when combined with complementary probes of the IGM, could begin to place meaningful constraints on the timing and morphology of helium reionization.",

Detailed analyses of galaxy-scale lenses have revealed localized gravitational perturbations beyond the smooth mass distribution of the main lens galaxy, largely attributed to dark matter subhalos and intervening line-of-sight halos. Recent studies suggest that, in contrast to subhalos, line-of-sight halos imprint distinct anisotropic features on the two-point correlation function of the effective lensing deflection field. These anisotropies are particularly sensitive to the collisional nature of dark matter, offering a potential means to test alternatives to the cold dark matter paradigm. In this study, we explore whether a neural density estimator can directly identify such anisotropic signatures from galaxy-galaxy strong lens images. We model the multipoles of the two-point function using a power-law parameterization and train a neural density estimator to predict the corresponding posterior distribution of lensing parameters, alongside parameter distributions for dark matter substructure. Our results show that recovering the dark matter substructure mass functions and mass-concentration parameters remains challenging, owing to difficulties in generating uniform training data set while using physically motivated priors. We also unveil an important degeneracy between the line-of-sight halo mass-function amplitude and the subhalo mass-function normalization. Furthermore, the network exhibits limited accuracy in predicting the two-point function multipole parameters, suggesting that both the training data and the adopted power-law fitting function may inadequately represent the true underlying structure of the anisotropic signal.",

The Doppler magnification arises from an apparent size variation caused by galaxies' peculiar velocities when mapping them from redshift space to real space. This phenomenon is the dominant contribution to the convergence at low redshifts ($\\lesssim$ 0.5). A practical observational strategy is to cross-correlate a galaxy number count tracer, e.g. from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Bright Galaxy Survey, with the convergence field reconstructed from galaxy size measurements obtained by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). To assess the achievable precision of galaxy size measurements, we simulate LSST Y1-quality galaxy images with Galsim and measure them with the Galight profile fitting package. Our investigations, based on galaxy populations from LSST's synthetic galaxy catalogue cosmoDC2, show that the variance due to intrinsic galaxy size variation dominates over size measurement errors as expected, but may be lower than previous studies have suggested. Under our analysis assumptions, the Doppler magnification dipole would be detectable with a signal-to-noise ratio $\\geq 10$ in multiple redshift bins between $0.1 \\leq z \\leq 0.5$ with DESI spectroscopic redshifts and LSST imaging.",

Zhou Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The calibration of tomographic redshift distributions is essential for cosmological analysis of weak lensing data. In this work, we calibrate all four tomographic bins of the Hyper Suprime Camera (HSC) weak lensing catalog with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 and 2 using the clustering redshifts technique. We include $z>1.2$ redshift sources such as emission line galaxies (ELG) and quasars (QSO) sources in our calibration, which were not available in the previous HSC calibration (Rau et al. 2022, arXiv:2211.16516), allowing a complete calibration of all the redshift bins. We find the first tomographic bin exhibits a small shift towards low redshifts. The second bin is in good agreement with the photometric calibration, while third and fourth bin exhibit a shift towards higher redshifts. However, these shifts are considerably smaller than the shifts obtained in the HSC Year 3 cosmic shear analyses. We evaluate the impact of galaxy bias and magnification effects from all the samples on the measurements, finding them to be small, and we propose corrections to reduce them further. We model the redshift distributions with splines and compare our results to previous analyses as well as to other parameterizations found in literature. For the two high-redshift tomographic bins, we find the shifts to higher redshifts with respect to the measurements performed in Rau+2022 to be $\\Delta z_3=-0.039^{+0.020}_{-0.021}$ and $\\Delta z_4=-0.048^{+0.012}_{-0.012}$.",

Seljak, T. Zhang Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We reanalyze cosmological constraints from Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Y3 shear-shear correlation function using new calibration of the tomographic redshift distribution via the clustering redshifts method with DESI spectroscopy presented in Choppin de Janvry et al. (2025a). We present both importance sampling of the original MCMC chains by HSC, applying the weights of our newly calibrated $\\Delta z$ priors, as well as full MCMC analysis with new photometric redshift distributions, finding consistent results between the two. We obtain the growth of structure parameter $S_8\\equiv\\sigma_8\\sqrt{\\Omega_m/0.3}=0.805\\pm{0.018}$, compared to previous HSC Y3 result of $S_8=0.769^{+0.031}_{-0.034}$, which is a 1.8 reduction of error due to the improved clustering redshift calibrations, with the central value shifting considerably higher towards Planck cosmology. With the new photometric redshift calibration, HSC Y3 has comparable constraining power to the recent KIDS Legacy and DES Y3. Combining all three gives $S_8=0.813^{+0.009}_{-0.010}$, which can be compared to $S_8=0.828\\pm 0.012$ from CMB lensing. Overall there is no evidence for deviation from Planck on $S_8$ in any of the weak lensing analyses, and combining galaxy lensing with CMB lensing gives a sub-percent constraint $S_8=0.818\\pm 0.007$, comparable in both precision and value to the most recent Planck+ACT+DESI constraint $S_8=0.812\\pm 0.007$.",

We employ three different methods -- the period-averaging (PA) method, the exact method, and the non-perturbative $\\delta N$ formalism -- to compute the power spectrum and bispectrum of curvature perturbations. Our results show that the non-perturbative $\\delta N$ method provides a reliable estimate across a wide range of reheating time and Higgs field values, including regimes where the Higgs field oscillates significantly after inflation. We find that a smaller Higgs self-coupling ($\\lambda$) leads to a larger curvature perturbation, with the non-Gaussianity predominantly taking a local shape. This highlights the importance of considering non-perturbative effects in calculating the curvature perturbation during Higgs modulated reheating, especially for smaller values of $\\lambda$. Our findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of reheating and the generation of primordial perturbations in the early Universe.",

Bengaly Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The BAO characteristic scale is a useful tool for understanding the evolution of the universe, especially the influence of dark energy on this evolution. In this work, we study the projection effect in transverse BAO, namely the mixing of BAO signals from different epochs caused by $z_c$ uncertainty within a chosen bin. We focus our forecast on two surveys of interest: the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) HI galaxy redshift survey and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)'s final Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample. We test the sensitivity in finding the transverse BAO depending of three bin configurations: a Gaussian, a top-hat and an intermediate of them semi-Gaussian. We also analyse the precision the bin widths $\\sigma_z$ from smaller to wider bins $0.01<\\sigma_z<0.1$. In order to correct these deviations, we propose a correction based on adjacent redshift to $z_c$, this would provide a semi-statistical correction instead of only relying on fiducial cosmology. Finally, we conclude that despite the higher shot-noise than the top-hat bin separation, the semi-Gaussian bin is the most accurate case to find the BAO signal and to constrain parameters through the angular power spectrum. A Gaussian binning gives the least precise parameter constraints compared to the other two cases.",

The 21 cm intensity mapping (21 cm IM) technique enables rapid large-area surveys that can deliver these measurements. China is constructing three hundred-meter-class single-dish radio telescopes, including the QiTai 110 m Radio Telescope (QTT), the 120 m Jingdong Radio Telescope (JRT), and the 120 m Huadian Radio Telescope (HRT), whose designs are well suited for 21 cm IM cosmology. We use a Fisher-to-MCMC forecasting framework to evaluate the baryon acoustic oscillations / redshift space distortions (BAO/RSD) measurement capabilities of QTT, JRT, and HRT and propagate them to dark-energy constraints in the $w_0w_a$CDM model. Our results show that achieving a redshift coverage up to $z_{\\mathrm{max}} = 1$ is crucial for fully realising the potential of hundred-meter-class single-dish telescopes for 21 cm cosmology. If all three telescopes carry out 21 cm IM surveys over the same redshift range up to $z_{\\mathrm{max}}=1$ and combine their BAO/RSD measurements, QTT+JRT+HRT yield $\\sigma(w_0)=0.094$ and $\\sigma(w_a)=0.487$, providing tighter constraints than DESI DR2 results.",

In this work, we use a bottom-up approach to study how PBHs with masses in the range $10^{8} \\leq M \\leq 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{g}$ modify Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) through Hawking radiation. We incorporate PBH evaporation into a reaction-network code to evaluate its impact on light-element abundances. Our analysis shows that PBH evaporation acts as an entropy injection mechanism, increasing the comoving entropy density. To reproduce the observed comoving entropy density per baryon $(s/n_{\\mathrm{b}})$ from the CMB, BBN simulations must therefore begin with a smaller initial entropy than in the standard scenario without PBHs. The results also reveal a threshold near $M \\approx 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{g}$ that separates two distinct regimes of BBN behavior. As an example, for $M \\geq 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{g}$, the $^4{\\mathrm{He}}$ mass fraction $Y_{\\mathrm{P}}$ increases monotonically with $\\beta$, driven by the enhanced Hubble expansion from PBH energy density. In contrast, for $M \\leq 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{g}$, $Y_{\\mathrm{P}}$ exhibits non-monotonic behavior shaped by the timing of PBH evaporation and its influence on nuclear reaction rates. These findings highlight the sensitivity of BBN to PBH evaporation and establish a framework for understanding how PBH populations influence the thermal history of the early universe.",

Abdalla Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Ultralight axions (ULAs) are hypothetical particles which can behave like dark matter (DM) or dark energy (DE) depending on masses generated at the symmetry-breaking scale. It remains a mystery whether the ULAs can make up a fraction of DM or DE. Although theoretical predictions indicate that the ULAs may leave distinct imprints on cosmological signals, these signatures may exist in a broad spatial and temporal scales, and may be degenerate with the known effects of the standard model. The ULA signatures are extremely subtle and the observational evidence of the ULAs remain elusive. In this work, we infer the ULA properties using both the early and late universe observations from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). We validate modeling of the ULA effects using the CMB and BAO mock data and perform different tests to cross-check the results. By analyzing the Planck 2018 CMB measurements and the BAO measurements from the Data Release 2 of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we constrain the energy density fraction ratio of the ULAs to total dark matter $\\Omega_a/\\Omega_d$ and obtain a new upper bound of $\\Omega_a/\\Omega_d$. Future CMB and BAO measurements will achieve unprecedented precision and will be crucial for understanding the nature of the ULAs.",

Zanoletti, the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) $E_G$ is a summary statistic that combines cosmological observables to achieve a test of gravity that is relatively model-independent. Here, we consider the power of a measurement of $E_G$ using galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering with sources from the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and lenses from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We first update the theoretical framework for the covariance of $E_G$ to accommodate this Stage IV scenario. We then demonstrate that $E_G$ offers in principle a model-agnostic test of gravity using only linear-scale information, with the caveat that a careful treatment of galaxy bias is required. We finally address the persistent issue of $E_G$'s theoretical dependence on the measured value of $\\Omega_{\\rm M}^0$. We propose a framework that takes advantage of the posterior predictive test to consistently incorporate uncertainty on $\\Omega_{\\rm M}^0$ in tests of gravity with $E_G$, which should be of general use beyond the LSST+DESI scenario. Our forecasting study using this method shows that the prior information available for $\\Omega_{\\rm M}^0$ is instrumental in determining the power of $E_G$ in the LSST+DESI context. For the full survey dataset, with priors on $\\Omega_{\\rm M}^0$ from existing CMB data, we find that for some modified gravity scenarios considered, we are likely to be able to reject the GR null hypothesis.",

Peng Oh, Suoqing Ji 17 pages, 17 figures, 1 table; submitted to MNRAS Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Cosmological N-body simulations have long suggested that the pseudo phase-space density (PPSD), $\\rho/\\sigma^3$, of cold dark matter halos follows the universal relation $\\rho/\\sigma^3 \\propto r^{\\chi}$, with $\\chi \\approx -1.875$, as predicted by spherical secondary-infall similarity solutions. This power law appears to hold despite the fact that neither the density $\\rho(r)$ nor velocity dispersion $\\sigma(r)$ follow universal power law relations individually, even at fixed mass. We analyze 246 host halos from the Symphony suite of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations, to consistently measure PPSD profiles across host masses from $10^{11}$ to $10^{15} M_\\odot$. We find that the PPSD systematically deviates from a power law, and that halos with larger deviations from Jeans equilibrium systematically develop steeper average PPSD slopes. This result suggests that the PPSD is not universal; instead, it is linked to a halo's degree of dynamical equilibrium, which is ultimately set by halo formation history. As a result, we show that secondary halo properties such as concentration and accretion rate inherit significant correlations with the PPSD slope. Moreover, our hosts' PPSD profiles are remarkably consistent with predictions from 1D self-similar fluid collapse models, indicating that three-dimensional structure, velocity anisotropy, and cosmological environment all play negligible roles in shaping the PPSD. These findings imply that the PPSD does not follow a universal power law, but is instead determined by halo mass assembly history alone.",

Notably, recent DESY5 Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) and DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data challenge the validity of the cosmological constant, and they remain in tension with SH0ES local distance ladder measurements under standard pre-recombination physics. Building on our previous work, MNRAS 523 (2023) 3, 3406-3422, we present a follow-up analysis of the model-independent calibration of the local and inverse distance ladders using cosmic chronometers (CCH) data and Gaussian Processes. We jointly constrain the SNIa absolute magnitude, $M$, the comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch, $r_d$, and the spatial curvature parameter, $\\Omega_k$, using CCH with DESY5 and DESI DR1/DR2. We find this data combination compatible with a flat universe at $\\sim1.7\\sigma$, with $\\Omega_k=-0.143\\pm0.085$, showing weaker compatibility than with Pantheon+, while the ladder calibrators read $M=-19.324_{-0.095}^{+0.092}$ and $r_d=(144.00^{+5.38}_{-4.88}$) Mpc. Although current uncertainties limit the precision of our constraints and prevent us from arbitrating the Hubble tension, it is nevertheless instructive to explore the constraining power of our methodology with future SNIa, CCH, and BAO from surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and DESI. We present the first forecast analysis for the triad $(M,\\Omega_k,r_d)$, finding that, in an optimistic scenario, upcoming data will improve agnostic constraints on $M$ by $\\sim$54% and on $r_d$ by $\\sim$66%, enabling a $\\sim2$% determination of $H_0$. Precision on $\\Omega_k$ will increase by $\\sim50$%.

For the busy reader: jump to figures 6 and 8 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Statistically-significant differences in the value of the Hubble parameter are found depending on the measurement method that is used, a result known as the Hubble tension. A variety of ways of comparing, grouping, and excluding measurements have been used to try to explain this, either in terms of physical effects or systematic errors. We present a systematic 'Bayesian jackknife' analysis of 16 independent measurements of the Hubble parameter in an attempt to identify whether the measurements fall into meaningful clusters that would help explain the origin of the tension. After evaluating evidence ratios for the commonly-used split into early- vs late-time measurements, we then study a range of simplified alternative physical scenarios that reflect different physical origins of an apparent bias or shift in the value of $H_0$, assigning phenomenological population parameters to each subset. These include scenarios where specific subsets are biased (e.g. due to unrecognised experimental systematics in the local distance ladder or cosmic microwave background measurements), as well as more cosmologically-motivated cases involving modifications to the expansion history. Many of these scenarios have similar marginal likelihood, but the model where no measurements are biased is strongly disfavoured. Finally, we marginalise over all these scenarios to estimate the 'model agnostic' posterior distribution of $H_0$. The resulting distribution is mildly multi-modal, but modestly favours values near $H_0=68$ km/s/Mpc, with a 95\\% credible region of $66.7 < H_0 < 72.7$ km/s/Mpc.",

We explore and validate a kinematics-based method for locating the critical curve. This method leverages the continuous line-of-sight velocity profile of the lensed galaxy mapped through integral field spectroscopy of nebular emission lines, and combines an agnostic local lens model and a disk rotation model. Applying our method to a highly magnified region of the Dragon Arc in the Abell 370 cluster lensing field using archival VLT/MUSE IFU mapping of the H$\\beta$ line, we constrain the critical curve to an uncertainty band with a half-width of 0.23\" ($1\\sigma$). This reveals locations of recently detected extremely magnified stars biased toward the negative-parity side of the critical curve, as predicted for intracluster microlensing. With future JWST/NIRSpec IFU mapping of the H$\\alpha$ line at SNR $\\simeq$ 10 (20), uncertainty may improve to 0.12\" (0.08\"). A measurement of this type with sufficiently small uncertainty may reveal small-scale wiggles in the shape of the critical curve where it crosses the giant arc, which can arise from the lensing perturbation of sub-galactic dark matter substructure. Our approach is generally applicable to caustic-crossing giant arcs in extragalactic lensing fields and can be incorporated into global lens modeling.",

Paper submited to Space Science and Technology Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The environmental density of galaxies within the cosmic web constrains their 3D locations in filaments, voids, groups, and clusters. It traces the distribution of baryons and the influence of dark-matter halos on galaxy evolution, and helps diagnose external processes such as supernova and AGN feedback, tidal interactions, ram-pressure stripping, and large-scale flows. We focus on isolated barred galaxies, the parent population that includes Milky Way analogs. To measure local environmental density and verify isolation (|Delta v| <= 500 km s^-1), we built a Python pipeline that works in two redshift regimes: low (z0 < 0.02) and high (z0 >= 0.02). Densities were estimated with k-nearest neighbors and Voronoi tessellations and classified as void (Sigma < 0.05), filament (0.05 <= Sigma < 0.5), group (0.5 <= Sigma < 2.0), and cluster (Sigma >= 2.0). Our northern-sky sample contains 311 isolated barred galaxies from 2MIG plus Milky Way analog systems (z < 0.07). We find 157 void, 84 filament, 27 group, and 11 cluster galaxies; 30 have no detected neighbors. Sixty-seven lie in extremely low-density regions (Sigma_3D < 0.01 gal Mpc^-3), and 22 have the nearest companion beyond 5 Mpc, indicating residence in extended voids. The Milky Way (Sigma_5NN ~ 0.13 gal Mpc^-3, R ~ 2.1 Mpc) and its close analog NGC 3521 both lie in filamentary environments at the edge of a nearby void. For z > 0.02 we identify three additional Milky Way analog candidates from the density metrics: CGCG 208-043 (3D Voronoi) and NGC 5231 and CGCG 047-026 (5th-nearest neighbor). These results show that local environmental density is an effective, physically motivated criterion for selecting Milky Way analogs.",

This allows for a measure of its relative proper motion by comparing the induced GW Doppler shifts between the different images. In addition, if the GW source is in a dynamical environment it will be subject to an acceleration, which will show up as a time dependent Doppler shift in each individual image. In this work we quantify for the first time how a joint detection of these effects can be used to constrain the underlying dynamics and environment of the lensed GW source. We consider a range of different astrophysical environments, from massive clusters to stellar triples, and find that binary black hole (BBH) mergers in Active Galactic Nuclei disks (AGN-disks) are particularly likely to have orbital parameters that can be constrained through our considered lensing setup. Applying these methods to the upcoming catalog of cosmologically strongly lensed GW sources will open up new possibilities for probing their origin and underlying formation mechanisms.",

A narrow region is consistent with all three constraints just outside their $1\\sigma$ uncertainties. Although this region is defined by techniques unrelated to the physics of recombination and the sound horizon then, the standard $Planck$ fit to the CMB anisotropies falls precisely in this region. This concordance argues against early-time explanations for the anomalously high local estimate of $H_0$ (the 'Hubble tension'), which can only be reconciled with the age constraint at an implausibly low $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{M}}$. We suggest instead that outflow from the local KBC supervoid (Keenan, Barger, & Cowie 2013) inflates redshifts in the nearby universe and thus the apparent local $H_0$. Given the difficulties with solutions in the early universe, we argue that the most promising alternative to a local void is a modification to the expansion history at late times, perhaps due to a changing dark energy density.",

Material for reproducing all figures available at this https URL JCAP, Volume 2025, Issue 09, id.008 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present the measurements and cosmological implications of the galaxy two-point clustering using over 4.7 million unique galaxy and quasar redshifts in the range $0.1<z<2.1$ divided into six redshift bins over a $\\sim 7,500$ square degree footprint, from the first year of observations with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI Data Release 1). By fitting the full power spectrum, we extend previous DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements to include redshift-space distortions and signals from the matter-radiation equality scale. For the first time, this Full-Shape analysis is blinded at the catalogue-level to avoid confirmation bias and the systematic errors are accounted for at the two-point clustering level, which automatically propagates them into any cosmological parameter. When analysing the data in terms of compressed model-agnostic variables, we obtain a combined precision of 4.7\\% on the amplitude of the redshift space distortion signal reaching similar precision with just one year of DESI data than with 20 years of observation from previous generation surveys. We analyse the data to directly constrain the cosmological parameters within the $\\Lambda$CDM model using perturbation theory and combine this information with the reconstructed DESI DR1 galaxy BAO. Using a Big Bang Nucleosynthesis Gaussian prior on the baryon density parameter, and a Gaussian prior on the spectral index, we constrain the matter density is $\\Omega_m=0.296\\pm 0.010 $ and the Hubble constant $H_0=(68.63 \\pm 0.79)[{\\rm km\\, s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}]$. Additionally, we measure the amplitude of clustering $\\sigma_8=0.841 \\pm 0.034$. The DESI DR1 results are in agreement with the $\\Lambda$CDM model based on general relativity with parameters consistent with those from Planck. The cosmological interpretation of these results in combination with external datasets are presented in a companion paper.",

Accepted for publication in MNRAS Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The Hubble parameter, $H(z)$, plays a crucial role in understanding the expansion history of the universe and constraining the Hubble constant, $\\mathrm{H}_0$. The Cosmic Chronometers (CC) method provides an independent approach to measuring $H(z)$, but existing studies either neglect off-diagonal elements in the covariance matrix or use an incomplete covariance matrix, limiting the accuracy of $\\mathrm{H}_0$ constraints. To address this, we use a Positive-Definite Covariance Network (PD-CovNet) to simulate the full $33 \\times 33$ covariance matrix based on a previously published $15 \\times 15$ covariance matrix. Hyperparameters are chosen via leave-one-z-out validation, and performance is benchmarked against a Gaussian-process (GP) baseline. Under identical five-fold cross-validation over redshift groups, we prove that PD-CovNet is a reliable generator of the full covariance compared to the GP baseline. Using this full PD-CovNet-simulated covariance alongside three comparators with different covariance specifications, we constrain $\\mathrm{H}_0$ with two independent methods (EMCEE and GP). Across all covariance specifications and both constraint methods, standardized differences and two-sided p-values show no statistically meaningful shift in the central value of the constrained $\\mathrm{H}_0$. However, the precision of the constrained $\\mathrm{H}_0$ depends on both covariance and method: EMCEE is uniformly more precise than GP once covariance is modeled; within a fixed method, incorporating more covariance reduces precision; and PD-CovNet hyperparameters have a modest effect on uncertainty. These results indicate the importance of accurate covariance modeling in CC-based $\\mathrm{H}_0$ constraints.",

Newman, Marina Ricci, The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will conduct the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), promising to discover billions of galaxies out to redshift 7, using six photometric bands ($ugrizy$) spanning the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared. The exact number of and quality of information about these galaxies will depend on survey depth in these six bands, which in turn depends on the LSST survey strategy: i.e., how often and how long to expose in each band. $u$-band depth is especially important for photometric redshift (photo-$z$) estimation and for detection of high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs). In this paper we use a simulated galaxy catalog and an analytic model for the LBG population to study how recent updates and proposed changes to Rubin's $u$-band throughput and LSST survey strategy impact photo-$z$ accuracy and LBG detection. We find that proposed variations in $u$-band strategy have a small impact on photo-$z$ accuracy for $z < 1.5$ galaxies, but the outlier fraction, scatter, and bias for higher redshift galaxies varies by up to 50%, depending on the survey strategy considered. The number of $u$-band dropout LBGs at $z \\sim 3$ is also highly sensitive to the $u$-band depth, varying by up to 500%, while the number of $griz$-band dropouts is only modestly affected. Under the new $u$-band strategy recommended by the Rubin Survey Cadence Optimization Committee, we predict $u$-band dropout number densities of $110$ deg$^{-2}$ (3200 deg$^{-2}$) in year 1 (10) of LSST. We discuss the implications of these results for LSST cosmology.",

We utilize recent results in small-scale PBH clustering to formulate $N(y)$ in such a way that accounts for variations in the binary mass ratio $q$. We then examine how this change affects the projected constraints on PBH abundance from simulated Einstein Telescope (ET) and LISA mergers. Our results indicate that for broadly extended mass distributions, the merger suppression is greatly reduced for binaries with $q \\gg 1$. This leads to an enhanced merger rate for binary distributions favoring a lighter average mass. This change is best reflected by an extension of the low mass end of the constraint windows derived from the resolvable merger channel, although this result is present as well in the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) constraints. Our results imply that the assumption of PBH clustering is testable at abundances and mass ranges much lower than anticipated. Note however that we have only considered the two-body merger channel in this work; a more thorough analysis of our scenario will require a study on the dynamics involved in the three-body merger channel for broad mass distributions, which we leave to future work.",

The heating function caused by decaying magnetic turbulence monotonically decreases after cosmological recombination, its amplitude strongly depends on the strength of the PMFs $B_0$ and weakly depends on the spectral index of the initial power spectrum of PMFs $n_{\\rm B}$. The heating function caused by ambipolar diffusion, in contrast, noticeably depends on the spectral index in the range $-3\\lesssim n_{\\rm B}\\lesssim4$, but is subdominant in the Dark Ages epoch for PMF models with $B_0\\lesssim0.5$ nG. We computed the ionisation and thermal history of intergalactic gas from the cosmological recombination up to the end of the Dark Ages epoch for a range of PMF parameters, $0.05\\lesssim B_0\\lesssim0.5$ nG, $-2.9\\lesssim n_{\\rm B}\\lesssim4$ and show the essentially distinguished thermal evolution from one in the $\\Lambda$CDM model. We also show that the profile of the redshifted 21 cm hydrogen line is very sensitive to the PMF parameters from this range and can be used for their constraints in conjunction with other observational data.",

However, the resonant nature of Ly$\\alpha$ radiative transfer complicates the interpretation of observed data. In this study, we develop a fast and accurate analytic prescription for computing the Ly$\\alpha$ intensity field on Mpc scales in the post-reionization Universe. Motivated by insights from Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) experiments, we exploit the fact that in a highly ionized intergalactic medium (IGM) with negligible damping-wing opacity, cosmological redshifting quickly drives Ly$\\alpha$ photons out of resonance, terminating the scattering process and simplifying their large-scale behavior. Photons emitted blueward of the Ly$\\alpha$ line center tend to scatter on a thin, nearly spherical surface of last scattering, with a radius determined by the redshifting distance to resonance. Based on this behavior, we derive closed-form expressions for the scattered emissivity and projected surface brightness that depend only on the source spectrum, the HI density, and the peculiar velocity field. When applied to a source in a realistically simulated IGM at $z = 3$, our model shows mild discrepancies with MCRT results within a physical Mpc of the host halo, where strong gravitational infall redistributes the scattered photons, but achieves better than 5% accuracy beyond that distance in angle-averaged radial surface brightness profile. Our prescription offers a computationally efficient alternative to MCRT for forward-modeling Ly$\\alpha$ intensity maps from cosmological simulations, enabling the inference of underlying cosmological and astrophysical parameters from future observations",

The article has been submitted, comments are welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Precise measurement of the sky radio brightness below 1 GHz and estimation of any unaccounted-for extragalactic brightness is required to understand the Galactic cosmic ray electron spectrum, to constrain populations of nanojansky radio sources, and to constrain dark matter annihilation or decay. The foreground radio brightness must also be accurately accounted for when measuring the cosmic background radiation and departures from its Planck spectrum that trace astrophysical processes in the early Universe, cosmic dark ages, cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionisation. Here we report a new, precision measurement of the sky spectral brightness over radio frequencies from 60 MHz to 350 MHz. Our measurement motivates a significant correction to previous all-sky images made in this band and the Global Sky Model (GSM) that is constructed from these and other sky images made at radio wavelengths. We find that the GSM requires subtraction of an offset exceeding 100K below 100 MHz and scaling up by a factor of approximately 1.2 below 200 MHz rising to a factor of 1.5 at 350 MHz, thus significantly enhancing previous estimates of unaccounted excess in radio sky brightness. Our measurements were made with a new receiver architecture that dynamically self-calibrates for receiver noise and bandpass in situ, while connected to an antenna. We used a single, accurately modelled, wideband logperiodic antenna placed on a 40m diameter ground mesh. Our accurate measurement requires upward revision of sky brightness and motivates revisiting models for source populations and dark matter decay. Additionally, sky models scaled to our measurements serve as a stable reference in calibrating the absolute flux density scale for low-frequency radio telescopes. This will be important for calibration accuracy of the SKA-Low telescope, that will operate at the frequencies of our measurements.",

Submitted to MNRAS Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Recent work has developed a formalism for computing angular power spectra directly from catalogues containing field values at discrete positions on the sky, thereby circumventing the need to create pixelised maps of the fields, as well as avoiding aliasing and finite-resolution effects. We adapt this formalism to incorporate template deprojection for mitigating systematic biases in the measured angular power spectra. We also introduce an alternative method of mitigating the `deprojection bias' - the loss of modes induced by deprojection - employing simple simulations to compute a transfer function. We find that this approach performs at least as well as existing methods, and is relatively insensitive to how well one can guess the true power spectrum of the observed field, except at the largest scales ($\\ell \\lesssim 3$). Additionally, we develop exact expressions for the bias introduced by deprojection in the shot-noise component, which further improves the accuracy of this approach. We test our formalism on simulated datasets, demonstrating its applicability both to discretely sampled fields, and to the special case of galaxy clustering, with the survey selection function defined in terms of a random catalogue or as a continuous sky map. After removing the bias in the shot noise and correcting for the remaining mode loss using a transfer function, our formalism produces unbiased measurements of the angular power spectrum in all scenarios tested here. Finally, we apply our formalism to real data and show it produces results consistent with the standard map-based pseudo-$C_\\ell$ formalism. We implement our method in the public code NaMaster.",

As the sample of time-delay lenses grows to statistical size, with $\\mathcal{O}$(1000) lensed AGN forecast to be observed by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), there is an emerging opportunity to use TDC as an independent probe of dark energy. To take advantage of this statistical sample, we implement a scalable hierarchical inference tool which computes the cosmological likelihood for hundreds of strong lenses simultaneously. With this new technique, we investigate the cosmological constraining power from a simulation of the full LSST sample. We start from individual lenses, and emulate the full joint hierarchical TDC analysis, including image-based modeling, time-delay measurement, velocity dispersion measurement, and external convergence prediction. We fully account for the mass-sheet and mass-anisotropy degeneracies. We assume a sample of 800 lenses, with varying levels of follow-up fidelity based on existing campaigns. With our baseline assumptions, within a flexible $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology, we simultaneously forecast a $\\sim$2.5% constraint on H0 and a dark energy figure of merit (DE FOM) of 6.7. We show that by expanding the sample from 50 lenses to include an additional 750 lenses with plausible LSST time-delay measurements, we improve the forecasted DE FOM by nearly a factor of 3, demonstrating the value of incorporating this portion of the sample. We also investigate different follow-up campaign strategies, and find significant improvements in the DE FOM with additional stellar kinematics measurements and higher-precision time-delay measurements. We also demonstrate how the redshift configuration of time-delay lenses impacts constraining power in $w_0w_a$CDM.",

Steinhardt Accepted for publication in A&A; 12 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Precise cosmological constraints from type Ia supernovae require adequately accurate corrections for host-galaxy extinction. Modelling these corrections is challenged by the problem of disentangling supernova intrinsic colours from host-galaxy interstellar reddening. The latter is commonly modelled in a probabilistic way assuming an exponential distribution exp(-E(B-V)/\\tau) as a universal prior which is applied across all types of supernova host galaxies. We test the robustness of the exponential model and its universality against predictions based on simulating dust and type Ia supernova distributions in host galaxies of different morphological types. We find substantial differences between predicted interstellar reddening in late- and early-type host galaxies, primarily driven by the stellar-to-dust mass ratios. The mean simulated reddening in late-type galaxies matches well those derived from type Ia supernova observations, but it is significantly lower for early-type host galaxies. The reddening distributions exhibit an excess of sight lines with vanishing reddening with respect to the exponential model, although the difference is quite mild for late-type galaxies. On the other hand, the distribution may peak at E(B-V)>0 when considering a population of young type Ia supernovae originating from lower heights within the dust disc. We demonstrate that assuming a universal reddening prior distribution for modeling peak magnitude-colour relation, which is currently a common practice, gives rise to a spurious scatter in the derived extinction properties. It may also bias relative distances between supernovae originating from different host-galaxy populations. The discrepancy between the simulated reddening in average early-type host galaxies and the observed occurrence of reddened supernovae suggests that reddening does not originate from interstellar dust expected in these galaxies.",

These findings have prompted the development of several theoretical models for the early formation and growth of black holes, which are, however, difficult to differentiate. We report the metallicity measurement around a gravitationally lensed massive black hole at redshift 7.04 (classified as a Little Red Dot), hosted in a galaxy with very low dynamical mass. The weakness of the [OIII]5007 emission line relative to the narrow H$\\beta$ emission indicates extremely low metallicity, about $4\\times 10^{-2}$ solar, and even more metal poor in the surrounding few 100 pc. We argue that such properties cannot be uncommon among accreting black holes around this early cosmic epoch. Explaining such a low chemical enrichment in a system that has developed a massive black hole is challenging for most theories. Models assuming heavy black hole seeds (such as Direct Collapse Black Holes) or super-Eddington accretion scenarios struggle to explain the observations, although they can potentially reproduce the observed properties in some cases. Models invoking \"primordial black holes\" (i.e. putative black holes formed shortly after the Big Bang) may potentially explain the low chemical enrichment associated with this black hole, although this class of models also requires further developments for proper testing.",

Clark Updated to match accepted version at MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Dwarf galaxies provide powerful laboratories for studying galaxy formation physics. Their early assembly, shallow gravitational potentials, and bursty, clustered star formation histories make them especially sensitive to the processes that regulate baryons through multi-phase outflows. Using high-resolution, cosmological zoom-in simulations of a dwarf galaxy from \\textit{the Pandora suite}, we explore the impact of stellar radiation, magnetic fields, and cosmic ray feedback on star formation, outflows, and metal retention. We find that our purely hydrodynamical model without non-thermal physics - in which supernova feedback is boosted to reproduce realistic stellar mass assembly - drives violent, overly enriched outflows that suppress the metal content of the host galaxy. Including radiation reduces the clustering of star formation and weakens feedback. However, the additional incorporation of cosmic rays produces fast, mass-loaded, multi-phase outflows consisting of both ionized and neutral gas components, in better agreement with observations. These outflows, which entrain a denser, more temperate ISM, exhibit broad metallicity distributions while preserving metals within the galaxy. Furthermore, the star formation history becomes more bursty, in agreement with recent JWST findings. These results highlight the essential role of non-thermal physics in galaxy evolution and the need to incorporate it in future galaxy formation models.",

Gamma-ray maps within the region of interest ($|l| \\le 60^\\circ$, $10^\\circ \\le |b| \\le 60^\\circ$) are modeled using point sources, the GALPROP models of cosmic-ray interactions, isotropic background, and templates of Loop I and the Fermi bubbles, and then the presence of a halo-like component is further examined. A statistically significant halo-like excess is found with a spectral peak around 20 GeV, while its flux is consistent with zero below 2 GeV and above 200 GeV. Examination of the fit residual maps indicates that a spherically symmetric halo component fits the map data well. The radial profile agrees with annihilation by the smooth NFW density profile, and may be slightly shallower than this, especially in the central region. Various systematic uncertainties are investigated, but the 20 GeV peak remains significant. In particular, the halo excess with a similar spectrum is detected even relative to the LAT standard background model, which contains non-template patches adjusted to match the observed map. The halo excess spectrum can be fitted by annihilation with a particle mass $m_\\chi \\sim$ 0.5-0.8 TeV and cross section $\\langle \\sigma \\upsilon \\rangle \\sim$ (5-8)$\\times 10^{-25} \\ \\rm cm^3 \\, s^{-1}$ for the $b\\bar{b}$ channel. This cross section is larger than the upper limits from dwarf galaxies and the canonical thermal relic value, but considering various uncertainties, especially the density profile of the MW halo, the dark matter interpretation of the 20 GeV ``Fermi halo'' remains feasible. The prospects for verification through future observations are briefly discussed.",

We present a targeted search for $\\gamma$-ray emission from five prominent galaxy merger systems, NGC~3256, NGC~660, UGC~813/816, UGC~12914/12915, and VV~114 using 16.9 years of Fermi-LAT data in the 1--300~GeV energy range. Employing a binned maximum likelihood analysis, we model the emission with power-law spectra and derive spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to constrain $\\gamma$-ray fluxes and spectral indices. Marginal detections are found for NGC~3256 (TS = 15.4, $\\sim$3.51$\\sigma$) and NGC~660 (TS = 8.16, $\\sim$2.39$\\sigma$), with photon fluxes of $(7.21 \\pm 3.17) \\times 10^{-11}$ and $(8.28 \\pm 3.56) \\times 10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively, suggesting merger driven star formation contributes to $\\gamma$-ray emission.

However, whether clusters possess statistically significant spin and how to measure it observationally remain open questions. Here, we present the first observational, statistical detection of coherent spin in galaxy clusters, using two samples of 2,170 and 1,329 systems with $M > 10^{14}\\,M_\\odot$, selected from two publicly available group catalogs (\\citet{2017A&A...602A.100T} and \\citet{2012ApJ...752...41Y}) constructed with two different algorithms and but both based primarily on SDSS galaxies. Cluster spin is quantified by identifying the orientation in the projected plane that maximizes the redshift difference ($\\Delta Z_{\\rm max}$) between member galaxies in two regions divided by a trial axis. We find compelling statistical evidence for coherent rotation, as the observed $\\Delta Z_{\\rm max}$ distribution departs markedly from the randomized controls, exhibiting pronounced deviations near $380\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$. Stacked visualizations confirm the spatial segregation of redshifted and blueshifted galaxies across the rotation axis. The radial profile of the rotational velocity indicates that it increases as a function of radius. The cluster rotation speed increases with mass, from $\\sim360~\\mathrm{km\\,s}^{-1}$ at $10^{14} M_\\odot$ to $\\sim693~\\mathrm{km\\,s}^{-1}$ at $10^{15} M_\\odot$. Additionally, cluster spin tends to align parallel with the central galaxy spin and perpendicular to the nearest cosmic filament, particularly in richer systems. These results reveal significant coherent spin in galaxy clusters, shaped by both internal dynamics and large-scale structure.",

It achieves hardware-agnostic performance portability across various GPU and CPU architectures using the Kokkos library. Crucially, Entity maintains a high standard for usability, clarity, and customizability, offering a robust and easy-to-use framework for developing new algorithms and grid geometries, which allows extensive control without requiring edits to the core source code. This paper details the core general-coordinate special-relativistic module. Entity is the first PIC code designed to solve the Vlasov-Maxwell system in general coordinates, enabling a coordinate-agnostic framework that provides the foundational structure for straightforward extension to arbitrary coordinate geometries. The core methodology achieves numerical stability by solving particle equations of motion in the global orthonormal Cartesian basis, despite using generalized coordinates like Cartesian, axisymmetric spherical, and quasi-spherical grids. Charge conservation is ensured via a specialized current deposition technique using conformal currents. The code exhibits robust scalability and performance portability on major GPU platforms (AMD MI250X, NVIDIA A100, and Intel Max Series), with the 3D particle pusher and the current deposition operating efficiently at about 2 nanoseconds per particle per timestep. Functionality is validated through a comprehensive suite of standard Cartesian plasma tests and the accurate modeling of relativistic magnetospheres in curvilinear axisymmetric geometries.",

In addition to our H{\\alpha} images, we have obtained matched continuum images which we subtract to reveal faint emission, including a far more extensive network of optical knots and filaments than reported previously. The deepest images also show an extremely faint, fairly diffuse arc of emission surrounding much of the circumference of Tycho to the southeast and south, coinciding with the rim of the radio/X-ray shell. We have measured proper motions for 46 filaments, including many fainter ones near the Tycho outer rim. Our measurements are generally consistent with previous ones by Kamper and vandenBergh (1978), but ours have far greater precision. Most optical filaments at the shell rim have expansion indices reasonably consistent with the Sedov value (0.40), while the interior filaments have somewhat smaller values, as expected. From the combination of proper motions of filaments at the shell rim and shock velocity at the same positions, one should be able to calculate the distance to Tycho by simple geometry. Determination of the shock velocity from broad Balmer-line profiles is subject to model uncertainties, but the availability of dozens of such filaments with a range of conditions offers the possibility to substantially improve the distance determination for Tycho.",

Buckley, Gavin Ramsay, Dan Jarvis 13 pages, 9 figures, submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present X-ray observations of the periodic optical source ZTF J185139.81+171430.3 (hereafter ZTF J1851) by the XMM, NICER and NuSTAR telescopes. The source was initially speculated to be a white dwarf (WD) pulsar system due to its short period ($P\\sim12$ min) and highly-modulated optical lightcurves. Our observations revealed a variable X-ray counterpart extending up to 40 keV with an X-ray luminosity of $L_X \\sim 3\\times10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (0.3--40 keV). Utilizing timing data from XMM and NICER, we detected a periodic signal at $P_{\\rm spin}=12.2640(7)\\pm0.0583$ min with $>6\\sigma$ significance. The pulsed profile displays $\\sim 25\\%$ and $\\sim10\\%$ modulation in the 0.3--2 and 2--10 keV bands, respectively. Broadband X-ray spectra are best characterized by an absorbed optically-thin thermal plasma model with $kT \\approx 25$ keV and a Fe K-$\\alpha$ fluorescent line at 6.4 keV. The bright and hard X-ray emission rules out the possibility of a WD pulsar or ultra-compact X-ray binary. The high plasma temperature and Fe emission lines suggest that ZTF J1851 is an intermediate polar spinning at 12.264 min. We employed an X-ray spectral model composed of the accretion column emission and X-ray reflection to fit the broadband X-ray spectra. Assuming spin equilibrium between the WD and the inner accretion disk, we derived a WD mass range of $M_{\\rm WD}=(1.07\\rm{-}1.32)M_{\\odot}$ exceeding the mean WD mass of IPs ($\\langle M_{\\rm WD} \\rangle = 0.8 M_\\odot)$. Our findings illustrate that follow-up broadband X-ray observations could provide unique diagnostics to elucidate the nature of periodic optical sources anticipated to be detected in the upcoming Rubin all-sky optical surveys.",

For this binary, we performed a timing analysis using 16 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope, covering the period from 2008 August to 2024 October. Our analysis detected an orbital modulation with a period of 0.2279781 days at a significance level of $\\sim4\\sigma$, which is in good agreement with previous findings. However, unlike previous reports, we identified a transition in the orbital modulation around 2021 August, after which the orbital signal disappeared. We speculate that the system may be undergoing a transition from a rotation-powered to an accretion-powered state at this epoch. Additionally, we conducted the phase-resolved and spectral analyses, and in the phase-resolved results, we observed an anti-correlation between its $\\gamma$-ray and X-ray emissions, which consistent with the predictions of high-energy radiation models for such systems. We provide some predictive discussions based on the results of $\\gamma$-ray data analysis, and future Fermi-LAT observations will determine whether these predictions hold true.",

Using the $\\gamma$-ray sensitivity of currently operating and next-generation imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, the flux and time-delay distribution can constrain the source distance. We further show that the detection of such a $\\gamma$-ray signal above the background depends on the EGMF strength.

We further identify 74 confident gigahertz-peaked spectrum pulsars, and demonstrate that millisecond pulsars frequently exhibit spectral curvature.

Based on observational data of SVOM/GRM and Fermi/GBM, we perform a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis for individual pulse in the prompt emission of this burst, and novel characteristics are revealed. Firstly, opposite evolutions of spectral lag are found in the first and third pulse of this burst. Second, the large negative lag of the first pulse is an outlier in short GRB sample, especially when the pulse duration is considered. Spectral analysis shows that the negative lag of the first pulse is caused by the evolution of spectrum index, and is irrelevant to Epeak, which is inconsistent with the previous study. The intrinsic mechanism is probably attributed to electron cooling in the decaying magnetic field, which leads to the continuous hardening of the spectrum index and results in negative lag. Furthermore, spectral analysis also shows that the third pulse is more likely to be described by a quasi-thermal spectrum, indicating the existence of photospheric emission. It is difficult to explain how the synchrotron radiation appears before photospheric emission in a single GRB and some assumptions are discussed.",

However, despite their importance in astrophysics, their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Neutrinos that emerge from the dense core of the star offer a promising way to study supernova dynamics. A strategy is presented to improve the potential of the KM3NeT neutrino telescope to detect core-collapse supernovae in our Galaxy or the Large Magellanic Cloud by further exploiting the properties of its optical modules equipped with multiple photomultipliers. A supernova burst is expected to produce a sudden hit rate increase in the KM3NeT detectors. New observables have been defined for individual optical modules that exploit the geometry and time distribution of the detected hits, enabling a better discrimination between signal and background signatures. In addition, a thorough investigation of the related systematic uncertainties is presented for the first time. When implemented, this new methodology allowed KM3NeT to probe 46% more Galactic core-collapse supernova candidates than with the previous trigger strategy, reaching the dense Galactic bulge. It is now expected that, once completed, KM3NeT will achieve full Galactic sensitivity to core-collapse supernovae.",

Our mode ls account for weak reactions, neutrino energy loss, nuclear energy release, pair production, degenerate equations of state, and general relativistic hydrodynamics. Depending on accretion rates, these systems can develop both proton and neutron-rich atmospheres with strong convective instabilities linking the neutrino sphere to the outgoing accretion shock inside the radia tion trapping zone. Convection drives nucleons through multiple heating and cooling cycles, with photodisintegration dominat ing during the heating phase and heavy element synthesis during the cooling phase, ejecting material with abundances that dep end on the accretion rate and depth of the final decompression trajectory. The turbulent nature of convective currents is con ducive to creating a wide range of nuclear products through a variety of effects, including NSE freezeout and $r$, $p$ and $\\ gamma$ processes. We also observe a novel multi-step process in reheated trajectories, consisting of proton-capture and photo-dissociation reactions operating on $r$-process seeds, producing overall neutron-deficient isotopes.

In this work, we present order-of-magnitude calculations of the energetics associated with this proposed jet-NLR interaction. We demonstrate that the observed outflows are capable of absorbing a fraction of the jet energy and converting it into kinetic energy. This mechanism provides a natural explanation for the optical spectral variability recorded with the X-shooter and Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instruments.

Ye, Smadar Naoz, Sanaea Rose 11 pages, 3 figures; Submitted to ApJL, all comments are welcome! High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The detection of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in both young and old stellar populations suggests multiple formation pathways, beyond just young magnetars from core-collapse supernovae. A promising delayed channel involves the formation of FRB-emitting neutron stars through merger- or accretion-induced collapse of a massive white dwarf (WD). By simulating a realistic stellar population with both binaries and triples, we identify pathways to WD collapse that could produce FRB candidates. We find that (i) triple dynamics open new merger channels inaccessible to isolated binaries, significantly enhancing the overall merger rate; (ii) triple-induced mergers broaden the delay-time distribution, producing long-delay ($\\gtrsim1$-8~Gyr) events largely independent of metallicity, alongside a shorter-delay population ($\\lesssim100$~Myr) of rapid mergers; (iii) these long delays naturally yield FRBs in older environments such as quiescent host galaxies and galactic halos; (iv) when convolved with the cosmic star-formation history, binary channels track the star-formation rate ($z_{\\rm peak} \\sim 2$), while triple channels peak later ($z_{\\rm peak} \\sim 1$), giving a combined local source rate of $R_0 \\approx 2\\times10^4~{\\rm Gpc^{-3}~yr^{-1}}$, consistent with observations; and (v) applying the same framework to Type~Ia supernovae, we find that triples extend the delay-time tail and roughly double the Ia efficiency relative to binaries, yielding rates and redshift evolution in good agreement with observations. If FRBs originate from the collapse of WDs, our results establish triples, alongside binaries, as a crucial and previously overlooked formation pathway whose predicted rates, host demographics, and redshift evolution offer clear tests for upcoming surveys.",

These MCPs could be measured by the IceCube neutrino telescope. The massless hidden photon model was taken for MCPs to interact with nuclei with a running electromagnetic coupling constant, so that the numbers and fluxes of expected MCPs may be evaluated at IceCube. Meanwhile, the numbers of expected neutrino background events were also evaluated at IceCube. Based on the assumption that no events are observed at IceCube in 10 years, the corresponding upper limits on MCP fluxes were calculated at 90\\% C. L.. These results indicated that the MCPs from the Earth's core could be directly detected at O(1TeV) energies at IceCube when $5.65\\times10^{-5}\\lesssim\\epsilon^2\\lesssim1.295\\times10^{-3}$.

Raiteri Review article published by The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review Astron Astrophys Rev (2025) 33:8; https://rdcu.be/eQZhj High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) With their jet pointing towards us, blazars are ideal tools to study the physics and structure of extragalactic jets. Their powerful jets are cosmic particle accelerators and are alleged to be one of the production sites of the high-energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube Observatory. Doppler beaming of the jet nonthermal radiation increases blazar brightness, blue-shifts their emission, and shortens their variability time scales, which are observed to range from years down to minutes. This review will focus on blazar flux, spectral, and polarization variability across the electromagnetic spectrum. Interpretation of blazar variability calls into question both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Shock waves, magnetic reconnection, and turbulence can accelerate particles inside the jet, while jet precession, rotation, and twisting can produce variations in Doppler beaming. Microvariability puts strong constraints on the size of the emitting regions, suggesting a multizone emitting jet. Twisting jets have been proposed to explain the long-term multiwavelength variability. They are supported by radio observations of bent or helical jets, and by results of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of plasma jets. Detection of (quasi)periodic behaviour has been ascribed to orbital motion in black hole binary systems, jet precession, kink instabilities developing inside the jet, or perturbations in the accretion disc. Gravitational microlensing has been suggested to explain blazar behaviour in some cases. Polarization provides information on the structure and behaviour of the magnetic field in the emission zones. Both the degree and angle of polarization can show strong and fast variability, which is sometimes correlated with flux. The interpretation of flux, spectral, and polarization variability within a consistent picture challenges current models of blazar variability.",

Belinski Submitted to A&A; 25 pages, 14 figures High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Tidal disruption events (TDEs) correspond to the destruction of a star by the tidal forces around a black hole, leading to outbursts which can last from months to years. These transients are rare, and increasing the current sample is paramount to understand them. As part of the Fink alert broker, we have developed an early detection system for TDEs for the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data. In this paper, we report on the optical transients we found either during the development of this tool, or when applying the classifier to the existing archive. We use this sample to anticipate what improvements to the TDE detection systems will need to be implemented for future surveys. For all the transients, we present optical and infrared archival photometry from ZTF, WISE, and Catalina, and assess the previous nuclear activity of the host. We fit the ZTF lightcurves with both a phenomenological and a physically-motivated model. We report on a total of 19 optical nuclear transients, out of which nine are in passive galaxies, eight in active galaxies, and two for which the activity of the host is uncertain. Two transients are newly discovered repeated TDE candidates, and we compare them to the current sample of repeated optical nuclear transients. One transient is exceptionally long-lived (over 5 years), in an until-now passive galaxy. Three of the TDE-like flares in active galaxies have absolute g-band magnitudes brighter than -24, making them new Extreme Nuclear Transient (ENT) candidates. One seemingly repeated object was revealed to be two independent supernovae in the same galaxy. This sample shows both the potential of our detection system for future discovery, and the relevance of archival searches to reveal overlooked transients. It also raises several points of concern and avenues of improvement for current and future classifiers.",

Arun 7 Pages, 3 figures, 1 Table; To be Submitted in ApJL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) have been argued to be related to the ejection of common envelopes (CEs) in binary star systems. Ejection of CEs leads to tightened stellar orbits capable of forming compact binaries that merge in Hubble time. As these mergers are seen by gravitational-wave (GW) detectors such as LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA (LVK), we ask what the merger rates of compact binaries in LVK tell us about the fraction of LRNe that lead to the formation of compact binaries that merge in Hubble time. Using the observed volumetric rates of LRNe from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and of compact binary mergers from LVK observations, we derive limits on the fraction of LRNe that produce compact binaries that merge in Hubble time. Assuming the LRNe rate closely follows the star formation rate at any redshift, we use the delay time distribution models for compact binaries to compute the compact binary merger rate. A comparison of this merger rate with the latest volumetric rates of compact binary mergers from the fourth GW transient catalog (GWTC-4) at the present epoch of LVK allows us to constrain the above fraction. We find that only a fraction as small as $\\sim 10^{-3}$ (median) of the LRNe correspond to the GW-observed binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. This potentially implies that the majority of the LRNe population will not lead to mergers of compact objects, but other end products, such as stellar mergers.",

Matthews Accepted for publication in MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Jets from stellar-mass and supermassive black holes provide the unique opportunity to study similar processes in two very different mass regimes. Historically, the apparent speeds of black hole x-ray binary (BHXRBs) jets have been observed to be lower than jet speeds from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and specifically blazars. In this work, we show that selection effects could be the primary cause of the observed population differences. For the first time, it is possible to perform a statistical analysis of the underlying BHXRB jet Lorentz factor distribution. We use both the Anderson-Darling test and apply nested sampling to this problem. With Bayes factors, we confirm that the Lorentz factor distribution of BHXRBs is best described with a power law, the same model that has been applied to AGN jets. For a Lorentz factor distribution following $\\rm N(\\Gamma) \\propto \\Gamma^b$ we find a value for the exponent of $b=-2.64_{-0.55}^{+0.46}$. This exponent is consistent with values found in AGN population studies, within $1\\sigma$ for \\textit{Swift}-BAT and \\textit{Fermi}-LAT selected AGN. The best-fit exponent for the radio selected MOJAVE sample is just above our $2 \\sigma$ limit. This is a remarkable agreement given the different scales at which the jets are observed. The observed slower apparent speeds in BHXRBs are largely due to the much larger inclinations in this sample. Furthermore, nested sampling confirms that $\\Gamma_{\\rm max}$ is completely unconstrained using this method. Therefore, based on kinematics alone, BHXRB jets are broadly consistent with being just as relativistic as those from supermassive black holes.",

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Dark matter is approximately five times more abundant than baryonic matter in the universe, but its physical nature continues to elude physicists. One potential candidate for dark matter is a weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP), which is predicted by various extensions to the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. After becoming gravitationally bound in cosmic structures, WIMPs can self-annihilate and produce SM particles including neutrinos, which are observable by detectors like IceCube. We present a search for neutrinos from low-mass $(\\leq 300 \\, \\mathrm{GeV})$ WIMP annihilation in dwarf spheroidal galaxies with over seven years of IceCube livetime. We find no statistically significant evidence of neutrinos produced by WIMP annihilation, and therefore set upper limits on the velocity-averaged annihilation cross section $\\left<\\sigma v\\right>$. Our strongest upper limits at the 90\\% confidence level are $\\mathcal{O}\\!\\left(10^{-22} \\, \\mathrm{{cm}^{3} \\, s^{-1}}\\right)$ for WIMP annihilation directly into neutrino-antineutrino pairs. For our least sensitive channel, the corresponding limits are $\\mathcal{O}\\!\\left(10^{-20} \\, \\mathrm{{cm}^{3} \\, s^{-1}}\\right)$, which is an improvement of over two orders of magnitude over previous IceCube limits from dwarf galaxies at the upper end of our mass range.",

Ciprini, C. Spingola, M. Razzano, A. Dominguez, M. Ajello, S. Cutini High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present the characterization of macrolensing properties of the gravitationally lensed system PKS 1830-211, utilizing data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. While at gamma-rays we can not spatially resolve the lensed images, a macrolensing-induced time pattern is expected in the blazar's lightcurve, resulting from the delay between variable gamma-ray components originating from its two brightest lensed images. Compared to our previous study, here we employ high-quality lightcurves coupled with prolonged outburst activity, and improved time-series techniques. Analyzing six independent data segments, we identified a delay of 20.26 +/- 0.62 days (statistical and stochastic uncertainty), with a chance detection probability at the 2.5 x $10^{-5}$ level (post-trial). We also present a novel approach to the magnification ratio estimate based on a comparison with simulated data. Our work suggests that the gamma-ray flux ratio between the two main lens components is $\\mu_{\\gamma} \\lesssim$ 1.8. We do not observe convincing evidence of microlensing effects, as previously claimed. The measured gamma-ray time delay is in 2-sigma tension with radio-based estimates, suggesting either distinct emission sites, underestimated radio uncertainties, or gamma-ray production in a region opaque to radio. Our study highlights the potential of well sampled lightcurves and advanced time-series techniques to distinguish true lensing-induced delays from stochastic variability. When combined with improved radio constraints and refined lens models, PKS 1830-211 and similar sources constitute promising systems for time-delay cosmography, offering new insights into both jet structure and cosmological parameters.",

Submitted to MNRAS Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th) We model early accretion of light elements, He, C, and O, onto a new-born neutron star using the public stellar evolution code MESA, simulating what may happen during the first few years of its life. We find that, under the appropriate conditions, significant amounts of these elements can be accreted up to densities of 10^9 g/cc without triggering a nuclear explosion that would convert them into heavy elements. These results help to understand observations that favor light elements in the atmospheres of young cooling neutron stars, as the one found in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A, and also add support to the recent indications for the presence of a neutron star, NS 1987A, in the remnant of SN 1987A.",

Johnson, Dominic Pesce, Lindy Blackburn, Peter Galison Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) achieves the highest angular resolution in astronomy. VLBI measures corrupted Fourier components, known as visibilities. Reconstructing on-sky images from these visibilities is a challenging inverse problem, particularly for sparse arrays such as the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), where incomplete sampling and severe calibration errors introduce significant uncertainty in the image. To help guide convergence and control the uncertainty in image reconstructions, regularization on the space of images is utilized, such as enforcing smoothness or similarity to a fiducial image. Coupled with this regularization is the introduction of a new set of parameters that modulate its strength. We present a hierarchical Bayesian imaging approach (Hierarchical Interferometric Bayesian Imaging, HIBI) that enables the quantification of uncertainty for al parameters. Incorporating instrumental effects within HIBI is straightforward, allowing for simultaneous imaging and calibration of data. To showcase HIBI's effectiveness and flexibility, we build a simple imaging model based on Markov random fields and demonstrate how different physical components can be included, e.g., black hole shadow size, and their uncertainties can be inferred. For example, while the original EHT publications were unable to constrain the ring width of M87*, HIBI measures a width of $9.3\\pm 1.3\\,\\mu{\\rm as}$. We apply HIBI to image and calibrate EHT synthetic data, real EHT observations of M87*, and multifrequency observations of \\oj287. Across these tests, HIBI accurately recovers a wide variety of image structures and quantifies their uncertainties. HIBI is publicly available in the this http URL VLBI software repository.",

This work focuses specifically on this low-energy regime, where sparse hit patterns limit the performance of topology-based reconstruction and classification methods. We introduce Waveform-based Particle Identification (WavePID), a statistically rigorous and interpretable likelihood-ratio discriminator for track-cascade separation, built from Monte Carlo templates in timing-aware, physics-motivated observables and validated through dedicated simulations. Applied to both Monte Carlo and 11.1 years of IceCube data, WavePID suggests improved cascade purity by about 5 percentage points at a fixed 20% down-selection rate relative to the current leading cascade selection, while maintaining Data-MC agreement within detector systematics. The approach is compact and robust to sparse observations, demonstrating the value of waveform-level timing for low-energy reconstruction.",

Kramer Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU) survey is an all-sky survey looking for pulsars and other radio transients. A new single-pulse (SP) search pipeline is presented, tailored to the northern part of the HTRU survey collected with the 100m Effelsberg Radio Telescope. In a selection of this data, synthetic SPs are injected with frequency-time structures resembling those of the detected Fast Radio Burst (FRB) population and processed by the pipeline to characterize its performance. Therefore, several new software toolkits have been developed (FRBfaker and RFIbye) to enable the injection of SPs with complex frequency-time structures and cope with the Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) in the survey's data. The operation of these toolkits is described alongside the overall functionality of the SP pipeline. Qualification of the pipeline confirmed that it is ready to process all the HTRU-North data. Additionally, the survey's sensitivity to SPs, the impact of RFI thereon, the performance of the deep-learning classifier FETCH, and some insights that may be used to improve the pipeline's performance in the future are determined. Within the small data sample analysed, 21 known pulsars and a RRAT are detected. In addition, eight faint SP trains that might originate from yet undiscovered neutron stars and 141 isolated SP candidates were discovered.",

Allen, Yair Krongold, Anjali Gupta 16 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables; accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a comprehensive analysis of 475 ks (438 ks unpublished & 37 ks archival) XMM-Newton/EPIC-pn observation of a nearby, highly inclined, star-forming, luminous infrared galaxy NGC 3221 through spatial, temporal, and spectral information. We confirm the presence of a low-luminosity (presumably Compton-thick) AGN. The 0.4$-$12 keV luminosity and the hardness ratio of the six ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULX) previously identified in Chandra data exhibit diverse variability on day-scale. The collective emission from unresolved sources exhibits a different day-scale variability. We have also discovered two new predominantly soft ($<1$ keV) sources. One of these has an enigmatic spectral shape featuring a soft component, which we interpret as a superbubble in NGC 3221, and a variable hard component from a compact object, which is unresolved from the superbubble. We do not confidently detect any X-ray emission from SN 1961L. The hot gas in the ISM (out to $\\pm$6 kpc from the disk plane) and the extraplanar region (6$-$12 kpc) both require two thermal phases at $\\sim 0.15$ keV and $\\sim 0.55$ keV. The $\\sim 0.55$ keV component is fainter in the ISM than the $\\sim 0.15$ keV component, but the emission from the latter falls off more steeply with disk height than the former. This makes the extraplanar region hotter and less dense than the ISM. The proximity of NGC 3221 and the occurrence of the underluminous AGN offer a unique observing opportunity to study the hot diffuse medium in conjunction with nuclear and disk-wide point sources.",

Ogilvie 22 pages, 15 figures, 1 table, submitted to MNRAS Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present the first local simulations of disc breaking/tearing in a warped accretion disc. Warps can arise due to a misalignment between the disc and the rotation axis of the central object, or a misalignment with the orbital plane of a binary (or planetary) companion. Warped discs can break into rings, as found in observations of circumbinary protoplanetary discs and global simulations of tilted discs around spinning black holes. In this work we isolate the mechanism of disc breaking in high-resolution, quasi-2D, local (shearing box), hydrodynamic simulations of a Keplerian disc. We consider the evolution of a free (unforced) warp in the wavelike ($\\alpha < H/r$) regime. At large warp amplitudes ($\\psi_{\\text{max}} \\gtrsim 1$) the disc breaks into four rings on timescales of around 20 orbits which are separated by gaps of around $\\sim 10H_0$. The warp exhibits a rich tapestry of small-scale dynamics, including horizontal sloshing motions, vertical oscillations or bouncing, warp steepening, and shocks. The shocks act as a source of enhanced dissipation which facilitates gap opening and thus disc breaking. At smaller warp amplitudes $\\psi_{\\text{max}} \\lesssim 1$, for which we also develop a quasi-linear theory, the disc does not break, but instead exhibits hydrodynamic parametric instability. We also investigate the effect of viscosity: at small warp amplitudes the parametric instability is damped and the warp propagates as a pure bending wave, while at large warp amplitudes the emerging gaps are partially filled by viscous diffusion.",

Stappers Manuscript submitted to Royal Astronomical Society Techniques and Instruments. 14 pages. 11 figures Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Traditionally, fast radio transient searches are conducted on dedispersed time series using thresholding techniques based on the statistical properties of the data. However, peaks in dedispersed time series do not directly provide information on the nature of the source. In the DM-time domain, the S/N variation of real, dispersed astrophysical signals forms a characteristic bow tie shape, whereas radio frequency interference (RFI) can take multiple different forms. We have developed a method that bypasses the thresholding step of traditional single-pulse searches in favour of a direct DM-time domain image analysis. The backbone of our pipeline is a Mask R-CNN, a deep learning model designed for object detection, enabling it to identify the bow tie signature and distinguish real sources from RFI. Previous deep learning models often include a snippet of the DM-time domain in their input. We have trained the model on simulated bursts injected on top of real MeerKAT noise observations. We tested the model on MeerKAT follow-up observations of the repeater FRB20240114A and we were able to recover all bursts with a signal-to-noise above the traditional threshold, while detecting two bursts that were fainter. Our new approach considerably reduces the number of candidates above a nominal threshold while being capable of running in real time for typical surveys. We also propose a modified version of the traditional dedispersion plan optimised for this method.",

Blazars, a class of extragalactic sources with relativistic jets pointing toward Earth, present a broadband emission interpretable via leptonic and hadronic processes, the latter relevant for proton acceleration and neutrino production. Several emission models have been developed to explain this multi-messenger observation, but the details of the neutrino production and the nature of TXS 0506+056 are not yet fully understood. In this work we investigate the properties of sources similar to TXS 0506+056. We select a sample of blazars from the Fermi 4LAC-DR2 catalog by constraining a number of key parameters in ranges centered on TXS 0506+056 values. We estimate their disk accretion efficiency and model their spectral energy distribution (SED) in terms of lepto-hadronic emission, gaining information respectively on the potential similarity of their environment with that of TXS 0506+056 and on their neutrino flux and detectability prospects at TeV energies. Our study shows the candidates' high energy emission to be dominated by leptonic processes. Part of them also show a high accretion rate, characteristic of FSRQs. For these sources, the very high energy (VHE) and neutrino fluxes appear undetectable by current and future instruments in an average emission state.",

We developed a unified framework to interpret both the observed energy spectra and the large-scale anisotropy. In this work, we explore the influence of the Sun's motion relative to the local plasma frame - the Compton-Getting (CG) effect - on the anisotropy. We find that incorporating the CG effect could slightly reduce the dipole amplitude and shift the phase away from the direction of the local regular magnetic field at tens of TeV. At lower energies, where the anisotropy from the cosmic-ray density gradient is weak, the Sun's relative motion becomes more prominent. Below $\\sim 200$ GeV, the dipole amplitude increases again, approaching the value expected from the CG effect. Additionally, a phase flip is observed at a few hundred GeV, aligning with the CG direction. Future anisotropy measurements from $100$ GeV to TeV energies could serve as a critical test of this effect.",

Sanchez Accepted for publication in MNRAS on 2025-11-21 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present an analysis of twenty tidal disruption event (TDE) host galaxies observed with the MUSE integral-field spectrograph on ESO VLT. We investigate the presence of extended emission line regions (EELRs) and study stellar populations mostly at sub-kpc scale around the host nuclei. EELRs are detected in 5/20 hosts, including two unreported systems. All EELRs are found at z<0.045, suggesting a distance bias and faint EELRs may be missed at higher redshift. EELRs only appear in post-merger systems and all such hosts at z<0.045 show them. Thus, we conclude that TDEs and galaxy mergers have a strong relation, and >45% of post-merger hosts in the sample exhibit EELRs. Furthermore, we constrained the distributions of stellar masses near the central black holes (BHs), using the spectral synthesis code Starlight and BPASS stellar evolution models. The youngest nuclear populations have typical ages of 1 Gyr and stellar masses below 2.5MSun. The populations that can produce observable TDEs around non-rotating BHs are dominated by subsolar-mass stars. 3/4 TDEs requiring larger stellar masses exhibit multi-peaked light curves, possibly implying relation to repeated partial disruptions of high-mass stars. The found distributions are in tension with the masses of the stars derived using light curve models. Mass segregation of the disrupted stars can enhance the rate of TDEs from supersolar-mass stars but our study implies that low-mass TDEs should still be abundant and even dominate the distribution, unless there is a mechanism that prohibits low-mass TDEs or their detection.",

Comments welcome! High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) The transport of cosmic rays through turbulent astrophysical plasmas still constitutes an open problem. Building on recent progress, we study the combined effect of magnetic mirroring and resonant curvature scattering on parallel and perpendicular transport. We conduct test-particle simulations in snapshots of an anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics simulation with $\\delta B/B_0\\sim 1$ and record magnetic moment variation and field line curvature around pitch-angle reversals. We find for strongly magnetized particles that (i) pitch-angle reversals may occur either in coherent regions of the field with small variation of the magnetic moment via magnetic mirroring or in chaotic regions of the field with strong variation of the magnetic moment via resonant curvature scattering; (ii) parallel transport can be modeled as a Lévy walk with a truncated power-law distribution based on pitch-angle reversal times; and (iii) perpendicular transport is enhanced by resonant curvature scattering in synergy with chaotic field line separation and diminished by magnetic mirroring due to confinement in locally ordered field line bundles. While magnetic mirroring constitutes the bulk of reversal events, resonant curvature scattering additionally acts on trajectories that fall in the loss cones of typical mirroring structures and thus provides the cut-off for the reversal time distribution. Our results, which highlight the role of the magnetic field line geometry in cosmic-ray transport processes, are consistent with energy-independent diffusion coefficients. We conclude by considering how energy-dependent observations could arise from an intermittently inhomogeneous interstellar medium.",

      "abstract": "Particle acceleration at radiative supernova remnant shocks Pierre Cristofari 9 pages, 8 Figures. Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Numerous astrophysical shock waves evolve in an environment where the radiative cooling behind the shock affects the hydrodynamical structure downstream, thereby influencing the potential for particle acceleration via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). We study the possibility for DSA to energize particles from the thermal pool and from pre-existing cosmic rays at radiative shocks, focusing on the case of supernova remnants (SNRs). We rely on a semi-analytical description of particle acceleration at collisionless shocks in the test-particle limit, estimating the total proton and electron content from SNRs throughout the radiative phase. Our results indicate that DSA can lead to significant particle acceleration during the first few tens of kyrs of the radiative phase. Although the associated multi-wavelength emission from SNRs in the radiative phase may not be detectable with current observatories in most cases, the radiative phase is found to lead to substantial deviations from the canonical p$^{-4}$ of the test-particle limit. The hardening/steepening is due to an interplay between a growing contribution of the reaccelerated term as the SNR volume expands and the effects of adiabatic and radiative losses on trapped particles as particles are confined for a longer time. The slope of the cumulative proton and electron spectra over the SNR lifetime thus depends on the environment in which the SNR shock propagates, and on the duration of the radiative phase during which DSA can take place. Overall, DSA in the radiative phase can lead to a total electron spectrum steeper than the proton spectrum, both at SNRs from thermonuclear and core-collapse SNe. Finally, we comment on the case of young radiative SNRs (in the first month to a few years after the explosion) for which the denser environments (with mass-loss rates of $\\dot{M} \\sim 10^{-1} - 1$ M$_{\\odot}$/yr) tend to inhibit DSA.",

However, recent observations-particularly the detection of GRB 221009A with photons up to 18 TeV by LHAASO and a 300 TeV photon by Carpet-3,pose a significant challenge to conventional EBL absorption models. These extraordinarily high-energy photons suggest the presence of new physics influencing photon propagation over cosmological distances. The gamma-ray spectrum in the tens-to-hundreds of TeV range provides a powerful probe of possible Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) or photon-axion-like particle (ALP) mixing in cosmic magnetic fields. Yet, when treated independently, neither LIV nor ALPs can fully explain the observed transparency of the Universe to VHE gamma rays. In this work, we propose a unified framework that combines both effects-ALPs and LIV-to account for the unexpectedly high survival probability of VHE photons. We analyze the multi-wavelength spectrum of GRB 221009A under this hybrid model and demonstrate that the combined influence of ALPs, characterized by a coupling constant $g_{a\\gamma} = 1.685 \\times 10^{-10},\\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ and mass ($m_a = 9.545 \\times 10^{-8},\\mathrm{eV}$) alongside second-order LIV characterized by an energy scale $E_{\\rm LIV,2} = (1.30_{-0.35}^{+0.56}) \\times 10^{-7} E_{\\rm Pl}$ adopted from the literature, significantly enhances the photon survival probability across the 10-300 TeV range. This synergistic ALP-LIV model provides a coherent explanation for the observed extreme-energy transparency of the Universe and the delayed arrival of ultra-high-energy photons, offering valuable insights into physics beyond the Standard Model.",

Valerin 22pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We report observations of Type Ia SN 2021hem, located in an apparently hostless environment. With a peak absolute B-band magnitude of -19.96 mag, and a lack of secondary maximum in near-infrared and i-band light curves make it resemble 2003fg-like events. The slowly evolving light curves, and the earliest spectrum showing CII absorption lines, further support this classification. Fireball model fit to early light curves yields a time of first light of -16.43 days relative to B-band maximum. The first detection occurs 1.51 days before the onset of the fireball-like flux rise. This early emission, and $(g - r)_0$ color, is inconsistent with circumstellar or companion interaction. Instead, shallow $^{56}$Ni mixing or an asymmetric $^{56}$Ni distribution offers a plausible explanation. SN2021hem is the fifth known 2003fg-like SN with early-time excess flux emission. The estimated mass of radioactive $^{56}$Ni in SN2021hem is $1.00\\pm0.09 M_\\odot$. Deep GTC imaging obtained 2.5 yr after the explosion (with $m_{lim,r}=24.4$ mag and $\\mu_{lim,r} = 26.3\\rm~mag~arsec^{-2}$), reveals no coincident host, thereby ruling out most faint dwarf and UDGs. Alternatively, assuming the nearest plausible AGN host galaxy, at a distance of 104 kpc, implies a hyper-velocity progenitor ejected at $\\sim$2200 km/s by AGN interaction. A faint diffuse feature ~6 kpc from the SN site has also been detected in the image, with its surface brightness of a UDGs. However, it is unclear whether it is a galaxy and is associated with SN2021hem. Considering its large normalized directional light distance ($d_{DLR}\\sim3-4$) from SN, and its unusual elongation, it is a candidate of low probability to be the host galaxy of SN2021hem. These results identify SN2021hem as one of the strongest candidates for a hostless SN Ia, underscoring the diversity of luminous, slowly evolving, 2003fg-like explosions.",

Bauer, Stephen Justham, Rüdiger Pakmor, Selma E. de Mink, Patrick Neunteufel Accepted for publication in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Compact binaries containing hot subdwarfs and white dwarfs have the potential to evolve into a variety of explosive transients. These systems could also explain hypervelocity runaway stars such as US 708. We use the detailed binary evolution code MESA to evolve hot subdwarf and white dwarf stars interacting in binaries. We explore their evolution towards double detonation supernovae, helium novae, or double white dwarfs. Our grid of 3120 models maps from initial conditions such as orbital period and masses of hot subdwarf and white dwarf to these outcomes. The minimum amount of helium required to ignite the helium shell that leads to a double detonation supernova in our grid is $\\approx 0.05 \\, \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$, likely too large to produce spectra similar to normal type Ia supernovae, but compatible with inferred helium shell masses from some observed peculiar type I supernovae. We also provide the helium shell masses for our double white dwarf systems, with a maximum He shell mass of $\\approx 0.18\\,\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$. In our double detonation systems, the orbital velocity of the surviving donor star ranges from $\\approx 450 \\, \\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$ to $\\approx 1000 \\, \\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$. Among the surviving donors, we also estimate the runaway velocities of proto-white dwarfs, which have higher runaway velocities than hot subdwarf stars of the same mass. Our grid will provide a first-order estimate of the potential outcomes for the observation of binaries containing hot subdwarfs and white dwarfs from future missions like Gaia, LSST, and LISA.",

Comments welcome Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) While relativistic magnetic reconnection in pair plasmas has emerged in recent years as a candidate for the origin of radiation from extreme astrophysical environments, the corresponding subrelativistic pair plasma regime has remained less explored, leaving open the question of how relativistic physics affects reconnection. In this paper, we investigate the differences between these regimes by contrasting 2D particle-in-cell simulations of reconnection in pair plasmas with relativistic magnetization ($\\sigma \\gg 1$) and subrelativistic magnetization ($\\sigma < 1$). By utilizing unprecedentedly large domain sizes and outflow boundary conditions, we demonstrate that lowering the magnetization results in a change in the reconnection geometry from a plasmoid chain to a Petschek geometry, where laminar exhausts bounded by slow-mode shocks emanate from a single diffusion region. We attribute this change to the reduced plasmoid production rate in the low-$\\sigma$ case: when the secondary tearing rate is sufficiently low, plasmoids are too few in number to prevent the system from relaxing into a stable Petschek configuration. This geometric change also affects particle energization: we show that while high-$\\sigma$ plasmoid chains generate power-law energy spectra, low-$\\sigma$ Petschek exhausts merely heat incoming plasma and yield negligible nonthermal acceleration. These results have implications for predicting the global current sheet geometry and the resulting energy spectrum in a variety of systems.",

Whelan 37 pages, 21 figures, 6 tables, accepted for publication in ApJ on November 12, 2025 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We analyze the H2 emission observed in the HH46 Class I system as part of PROJECT-J (Protostellar Jets Cradle Tested with JWST), to investigate the origin and excitation of the warm molecular outflow. We used NIRSpec and MIRI spectral maps (1.6-27.9 microns) to trace the structure and physical conditions of the outflow. By fitting the H2 rotational diagrams with a multi-temperature gas model, we derived key physical parameters including temperature, extinction, column densities, and the ortho-to-para ratio. This information is combined with a detailed kinematical analysis and comparison with irradiated shock models. We find no evidence of H2 temperature or velocity stratification from the axis to the edge of the outflow, as would be expected in MHD disk-wind models and as observed in other outflows. Instead, the observations suggest that the H2 emission arises from shock interactions between jet bow shocks and/or wide-angle winds with the ambient medium and cavity walls. NIRSpec emission and velocity maps reveal expanding molecular shells, likely driven by the less luminous source in the binary system. We infer an accretion rate of less than 10^-9 solar masses per year for the secondary source, approximately one order of magnitude lower than that of the primary. The H2 emission is consistent with excitation by low-velocity (approximately 10 km/s) J-type shocks, irradiated by an external UV field that may originate from strong dissociative shocks driven by the atomic jet. Future JWST observations will further constrain the evolution of the expanding shell and the mechanisms driving the outflow.",

Willmer, Yang Sun Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Low surface brightness galaxies (LSBs) are an important class of galaxies that allow us to broaden our understanding of galaxy formation and test various cosmological models. We present a survey of low surface brightness galaxies at $0.4 < z_{\\rm phot} < 0.8$ in the GOODS-S field using JADES data. We model LSB surface brightness profiles, identifying those with $\\bar{\\mu}_{\\rm eff} > 24$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in the F200W JWST/NIRCam filter. We study the spatial distribution, number density, Sérsic profile parameters, and rest-frame colours of these LSBs. We compare the photometrically-derived star formation histories, mass-weighted ages, and dust attenuations of these galaxies with a high surface brightness (HSB) sample at similar redshift and a lower redshift ($z_{\\rm phot} < 0.4$) LSB sample, all of which have stellar masses $\\lesssim 10^8 M_{\\odot}$. We find that both the high and the low redshift LSB samples have low star formation (SFR$_{100} \\lesssim 0.01$ $M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) compared with the HSB sample (SFR$_{100} \\gtrsim 0.01$ $M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). The star formation histories show that the LSBs and HSBs possibly come from the same progenitors at $z \\gtrsim 2$, though the histories are not well constrained for the LSB samples.

Vieira, David Vizgan, George Wang, Axel Weiss Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Following the detection of a radio-loud Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in the z=4.3 protocluster SPT2349-56, we have obtained additional observations with MeerKAT in S-band (2.4 GHz) with the aim of further characterizing radio emission from amongst the ~30 submillimeter (submm) galaxies (SMGs) identified in the structure. We newly identify three of the protocluster SMGs individually at 2.4GHz as having a radio-excess, two of which are now known to be X-ray luminous AGN. Two additional members are also detected with radio emission consistent with their star formation rate (SFR). Archival MeerKAT UHF (816 MHz) observations further constrain luminosities and radio spectral indices of these five galaxies. The Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) is used to detect and resolve the central two sources at 5.5 and 9.0 GHz finding elongated, jet-like morphologies. The excess radio luminosities range from L1.4,rest = (1-20)x10^25 W/Hz, ~10-100x higher than expected from the SFRs, assuming the usual far-infrared-radio correlation. Of the known cluster members, only the SMG `N1' shows signs of AGN in any other diagnostics, namely a large and compact excess in CO(11-10) line emission. We compare these results to field samples of radio sources and SMGs. The overdensity of radio-loud AGN in the compact core region of the cluster may be providing significant heating to the recently discovered nascent intra-cluster medium (ICM) in SPT2349-56.",

Walker, Jennifer Wallace, Qizhou Zhang Accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Galactic Center (GC) is an extreme region of the Milky Way that is host to a complex set of thermal and non-thermal structures. In particular, the GC contains high-density gas and dust that is collectively referred to as the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). In this work, we study a subset of HNCO filaments identified in band 3 ALMA observations of the GC obtained by the ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey (ACES) that are comparable to high density filaments identified in the Galactic Disk. We compare the orientation of the magnetic field derived from 214 um SOFIA and 850 um JCMT observations with the filament orientation to determine which mechanisms dominate the formation of these filaments. We observe a large range of magnetic orientations in our observed filaments indicating the complex environments the filaments are located in. We also compare the observational results to synthetic data sets created using an MHD model of the GC. Our analysis reveals that the dominant mechanisms local to the HNCO filaments vary throughout the GC with some filaments being dominated by supersonic turbulence and others by subsonic turbulence. The comparison to synthetic observations indicates that the observed filaments are in magnetically dominated environments that could be supporting these filaments against collapse. Our results on the CMZ filaments are also compared to results obtained on similar filaments located in the Galactic Disk, and we find that the filaments studied here are possible CMZ analogs to the dense filamentary \"bones\" observed previously in the Galactic Disk.",

      "abstract": "Tracing Quenching in Nearby Galaxies Through Inner Surface Mass Density and Cold Gas Content Evangela E. Shread, Trevor J. Weiss, Jerome J. Fang, Cameron Law Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The inner stellar mass surface density within 1 kpc, Sigma1, has emerged as a suitable proxy for bulge growth and galaxy quenching. However, the dependence of cold gas content on Sigma1 has not been thoroughly explored. In this paper, we examine the relationship between Sigma1, as well as the mass-relative parameter delSigma1, and the atomic (fHI) and molecular (fH2) cold gas fractions in massive, nearby galaxies. We utilize a sample of 341 galaxies with HI data and 201 galaxies with H2 data from the xGASS and xCOLDGASS surveys, spanning 0.02 <= z <= 0.05 and a stellar mass range of 10^10 <= M_*/M_odot <= 10^11.5. While we observe that a decline in both fHI and fH2 is associated with increasing Sigma1, we find that fH2 shows a sharper decline above a threshold value of delSigma1 = 0. In addition, the fraction of galaxies with AGN activity (Seyferts and LINERs) increases with delSigma1, with the greatest increase occurring between 0 <= delSigma1 <= 0.2 dex. We propose an evolutionary track in the plane of fH2-delSigma1, whereby molecular gas depletion at fixed mass coincides with a rise in AGN activity. Our results suggest that central bulge growth is more tightly coupled to the depletion of molecular gas rather than atomic gas, with AGN feedback possibly contributing to this process. Our work highlights the utility of Sigma1 and delSigma1 as tracers of quenching in massive galaxies.",

The 3D filaments are defined to be linear HI features that are continuous in position-position-velocity (PPV) and are found with fil3d, an algorithm that expands on the 2D FilFinder. The catalog contains 3333 HI filaments between +/- 50 km/s at a range of Galactic positions. 1542 of the PPV filaments are identified as local at the distance of the wall of the Local Bubble, and 209 are likely at the disk-halo interface of our Galaxy. The catalog and properties of the PPV filaments are obtained after an unsharp mask (USM) is applied to the data. The widths of the filaments are consistently ~12' (0.34 pc at 100 pc), and constrained by the 4' resolution. The local filaments have median properties of N_HI = $6 \\times 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$, M_HI = 0.17 M_sun, FWHM = 3.2 km/s, and length of 6.4 pc. The disk-halo population has similar column densities, but the median FWHM = 7.7 km/s, consistent with them being higher z-height, warmer structures. The L $\\propto$ M$^{0.5}$ relationship found for the HI filaments and their bundling on the sky are consistent with a hierarchical structure, and is likely related to turbulence playing a role in their formation.",

However, our understanding of cluster magnetism is limited due to the scarcity of polarized background radio sources, with most previous studies being constrained to $\\sim 10$ sources per cluster. Leveraging the increased source density of the POlarisation Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM), we probe the magnetic field properties of the galaxy cluster Abell 3581 {(A3581)} with 111 RMs. We find that the standard deviation in the RM declines monotonically with increasing radius up to 0.75 Mpc{, agreeing with a radially declining magnetic field and electron density profile modeled as Gaussian and lognormal random fields, respectively. {We compare our observations of the inner 0.75 Mpc of A3581 to various semi-analytic models of the magnetic field and electron density, and obtain several best-fit models.} For the first time, we compare the observed RMs in a cluster to full magnetohydrodynamic simulated clusters from TNG-Cluster and find that the non-monotonic trend in RM standard deviation past 0.75 Mpc in A3581 is likely caused by past or present merger activity. We identify a possible candidate for a merger to be the galaxy group [DZ2015b] 276, which would be the first group detected in RMs that is not strongly emitting in X-rays. We find a possible merger axis of A3581 with this group at a position angle of $\\theta = 52\\pm 4$ deg.",

We present a preliminary domain adaptation pipeline that trains on simulated TNG50 galaxies and evaluates on real SDSS galaxies with morphology labels (elliptical/spiral/irregular). We train three backbones (CNN, $E(2)$-steerable CNN, ResNet-18) with focal loss and effective-number class weighting, and a feature-level domain loss $L_D$ built from GeomLoss (entropic Sinkhorn OT, energy distance, Gaussian MMD, and related metrics). We show that a combination of these losses with an OT-based \"top_$k$ soft matching\" loss that focuses $L_D$ on the worst-matched source-target pairs can further enhance domain alignment. With Euclidean distance, scheduled alignment weights, and top-$k$ matching, target accuracy (macro F1) rises from $\\sim$46% ($\\sim$30%) at no adaptation to $\\sim$87% ($\\sim$62.6%), with a domain AUC near 0.5, indicating strong latent-space mixing.",

Putman, Yong Zheng, J. E. G. Peek, Hannah Bish, David Schiminovich 15 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in ApJL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Magellanic Stream (MS) is a vast gaseous structure in the Milky Way halo, containing most of its mass in ionized form and tracing the interaction between the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds and the Galaxy. Using HST/COS G160M spectra from the Plane Quasar Survey, we detect C IV absorbers likely associated with the MS, extending to the northern side of the Galactic plane, approximately 60$^\\circ$ beyond its previously known ionized extent. These absorbers exhibit position and kinematic alignment and show consistent ionization trends with previously studied MS sight lines. The non-detection of low ions such as Al II and Si II, and the detection of C IV (and Si IV in some sightlines), indicates a highly ionized gas phase. The observed Si IV/C IV column density ratios suggest a gas temperature of $T \\sim 10^{5.3}$~K and favor collisional ionization over photoionization. We estimate the newly detected extension increases the previous ionized gas mass of the MS, and its coherent kinematics suggest that it was stripped within the past few hundred Myr and has not yet mixed with the Milky Way halo. The existence of highly-ionized MS gas at a location above the Galactic Plane may constrain the orbital direction of the Magellanic Clouds.",

Hayden 23 pages, 12 figures. Submitted to OJA. Comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The earliest phase of the Milky Way's evolution involved a transition from a dispersion-supported proto-galaxy to a rotationally supported disk. A key chemical signature of this transition is the moderate rise in [$\\alpha$/Fe] near $\\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\\approx-1.3$, which we previously interpreted as evidence for $\\alpha$-enhanced gas accretion fueling early disk formation. However, this trend alone does not uniquely constrain the trade-off between initial gas mass, inflow rate, and star formation efficiency (SFE), leaving the physical condition of the proto-Milky Way uncertain. To break this degeneracy, we analyze the metal-poor tail ($-3<\\mathrm{[Fe/H]}<-2$) of the Milky Way's metallicity distribution function (MDF) using Gaia DR3 BP/RP (XP) metallicities from ten catalogs. After applying recommended quality cuts, all catalogs exhibit a single-slope exponential tail with slopes $k\\simeq0.5$--2.0. Comparison with one-zone galactic chemical-evolution (GCE) models that replicated the [$\\alpha$/Fe]-rise from Paper I shows that shallow tails ($k\\simeq0.6$) require a massive initial cold gas reservoir ($\\gtrsim10^9\\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$), while steeper tails ($k\\gtrsim1$) arise from small reservoirs that built up over time with weak inflow. MDFs with $k \\simeq 1.0$ are best reproduced under our GCE framework, which favor a proto-Galaxy with a moderate gas reservoir ($10^{8}$--$10^{9}\\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$) sustained through weak continuous inflow ($\\sim 2 \\ \\mathrm{M_\\odot\\,yr^{-1}}$) and SFE comparable to today's value (a few $\\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$) during the first Gyr. This scenario is reinforced by MDFs of 30 Milky Way analogs in the Auriga simulations, which exhibit similar slopes ($k\\approx1.2$). The metal-poor MDF tail thus provides a quantitative constraint on the Milky Way's early gas accretion and star formation history.",

We define a dimensionless metric, $\\eta$, that characterises the ratio of the quadrupole and monopole coefficients in the Fourier-Laguerre basis function expansion. This metric serves as a robust measure which is related to the inclination of a galaxy. We find an empirical relationship between $\\eta$ and inclination which is agnostic to the galaxy morphology. The PA is derived directly from the phase of the quadrupolar Fourier-Laguerre functions. Across a benchmark sample of galaxies, the method reproduces published inclination and PA values to within a median of 10$^\\circ$ and 5$^\\circ$, respectively, while also demonstrating essentially zero catastrophic failures. Applying this pipeline to galaxies from the Siena Galaxy Atlas (SGA), we report measurements of $\\eta$, scale length and PA for three different bands of 133,942 disc galaxies.

Zapata Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) There is clear observational evidence that the main Class 0/I stages of the star formation process are associated with powerful collimated outflows (jets), which sometimes propagate up to distances as large as $10^{4-5}$ au scales in molecular clouds. Additionally, intermediate high-mass and low-mass protostars have often been observed to form in crowded clusters, where the typical separation distance between any two cluster members is of the same order or smaller than the scale of the outflow length. Therefore, there must be an interaction between the molecular outflows of different protostars within the protostellar association. A good example of this is the case of Cepheus E-mm, which is a protostellar outflow extending over a few dozen au. At its core is a binary system consisting of two protostars, Cep E-A and Cep E-B, separated by about 1000 au. Both protostars eject molecular jets at velocities of ~100 km/s. The interaction between these molecular outflows provides an opportunity to study the effects of jet collisions in a clustered star-forming environment, as they may leave detectable imprints on the morphology of the main envelope of the system. Our work aims to study the effects of the collision of molecular jets associated with the components of the binary system Cep-A and Cep-E, analyzing the disruption or reduction of molecular emission in the main envelope of the system, which the molecular outflow { launched} by Cep-A presumably pushes. If we characterize the collision in this system, we can provide insights into the expected morphology and molecular emissions in collisions of molecular outflows { associated to star forming process.",

Cosmogonic considerations suggest that this body may possess relatively high tensile strength and a substantial metal fraction. We present photometric observations along its inbound trajectory toward perihelion, together with a spectroscopic comparison to pristine carbonaceous chondrites from the NASA Antarctic collection. The spectral similarities indicate that 3I/ATLAS may be a primitive carbonaceous object, likely enriched in native metal and undergoing significant aqueous alteration during its approach to the Sun, experiencing cryovolcanism as we could expect for a pristine Trans-Neptunian Object. We propose that the combination of elevated metal abundance and abundant water ice can account for the unusual coma morphology and chemical products reported to date. To do so, corrosion of fine-grained metal grains can originate energetic Fischer-Tropsch reactions, generating specific chemical products into the coma that are not so common in other comets because most of them formed in the outer solar system and didn't inherited so much metal. Interstellar objects such as 3I/ATLAS provide rare opportunities to investigate physical and chemical processes in distant minor bodies of our own Solar System, including trans-Neptunian objects and Oort Cloud comets.",

Published in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a broad-line AGN at z=5.077, observed with both NIRSpec/MSA and NIRSpec/IFU by the JADES and BlackTHUNDER surveys. The target exhibits all the hallmark features of a 'Little Red Dot' (LRD) AGN. The combination of spatially resolved and high-resolution spectroscopy offers deeper insight into its nature. The H$\\alpha$ line has multiple components, including two broad Gaussians, yielding a black-hole mass of $\\log(M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\odot)=7.65$, while the narrow [O III]$\\lambda$5007 gives a galaxy dynamical mass of $\\log(M_{\\rm dyn}/M_\\odot)=9.1$ suggesting a dynamically overmassive black hole relative to the host galaxy. The target is immersed in a 7-kpc wide pool of ionized gas and has three neighbours: a satellite galaxy, a possible satellite/gas cloud and a tentatively detected spatially detached outflow. H$\\alpha$ shows strong absorption, deeper than the continuum, thus ruling out a stellar origin, and with velocity and velocity dispersion of v=-13 km s$^{-1}$ and $\\sigma$=120 km s$^{-1}$. There is tentative evidence (2.6 $\\sigma$) of temporal variability in the EW of the H$\\alpha$ absorber over two rest-frame months. If confirmed, this would suggest a highly dynamic environment. Notably, while the H$\\alpha$ absorber is clearly visible and even dominant in the high-resolution G395H observations, it is not detected in the medium-resolution G395M data of the same epoch. This implies that the current incidence rate of absorbers in LRDs - and especially of rest-frame absorbers - may be severely underestimated, because most LRDs rely on lower-resolution spectroscopy. In this context, the high incidence rate of rest-frame absorbers in LRDs may indicate a configuration that is either intrinsically stationary, such as a rotating disc, or that exhibits time-averaged stability, such as an oscillatory 'breathing mode' accretion of cyclic expansion and contraction of the gas around the SMBH.",

Andersson, Mordecai-Mark Mac Low 10 pages, 7 figures, 1 appendix with 2 additional figures. Accepted to Astronomy & Astrophysics on November 21, 2025. Comments welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Galaxy evolution is sensitive to how stars inject feedback into their surroundings. In particular, stellar feedback from star clusters strongly affects gas motions and the baryonic cycle, with more massive clusters having stronger effects. Our previous results show that the star cluster mass distribution in dwarf galaxies depends on feedback, as strong pre-SN feedback, particularly ionizing radiation, results in fewer high-mass clusters. We investigate the mass distribution of gas clouds in dwarf galaxies. Since clusters form from collapsing gas clouds, we expect a similar feedback dependence in both distributions, so we hypothesize that pre-SN feedback yields fewer high-mass clouds. To test this, we use an isocontour analysis at cutoff densities of $10,\\ 10^{1.5},\\ 10^{2}$ cm$^{-3}$ to identify clouds in dwarf galaxy simulations run with the RAMSES adaptive mesh refinement code. We calculate mass distributions for models with different combinations of SNe, stellar winds, and ionizing radiation. We find that the mass distribution for clouds with $n>100$ cm$^{-3}$ is independent of feedback, but the distribution for complexes with $n>10$ cm$^{-3}$ is more top-heavy in the presence of radiation. Winds do not affect the distribution at any scale. This contradicts our hypothesis that cloud and cluster mass distributions respond similarly to feedback. Instead, the dense cloud mass function shows no feedback dependence, suggesting its shape is set by gravity. We conclude that the cluster mass function must be shaped by intra-cloud feedback regulating star formation and, in the case of radiation, effects on parent cloud temperature. (shortened)",

Strauss, Shenli Tang 11 pages, 6 figures, 1 table. revised version after resubmission Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) During cosmic noon ($z\\sim1-3$), when both star formation and black hole growth peaked, galaxy mergers are predicted to trigger dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) that eventually coalesce as supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. However, observations of dual quasars with sub-5 kpc separations-the critical phase preceding final coalescence-have remained challenging due to angular resolution limitations. We present the discovery and confirmation of two sub-arcsecond dual quasars at $z>1$, selected from 59,025 SDSS quasars, which fall within the footprint of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey. Using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging and slitless spectroscopy, we confirmed SDSS J1625+4309 ($z=1.647$, separation 0.55\"/4.7 kpc) and SDSS J0229$-$0514 ($z=3.174$, separation 0.42\"/3.2 kpc), probing the sub-5 kpc separation regime. Through novel combination of WFC3/IR direct imaging (F140W) and grism spectroscopy (G141), we resolve both components morphologically and spectroscopically confirm their dual nature via detection of H$\\beta$+[OIII] and MgII emission lines in each nucleus. Two-dimensional image decomposition reveals distinct host galaxy morphologies: J1625+4309 shows an extended, disturbed structure ($R_e$=4.7 kpc) indicative of an ongoing major merger, while J0229$-$0514 exhibits a compact host ($R_e$=1.4 kpc) suggesting an advanced coalescence stage. Black hole mass estimates based on virial relations yield M$_{\\mathrm{BH}} \\sim 10^{8.1}-10^{8.7} M_\\odot$ with line-of-sight velocity offsets of $(0.7\\pm0.1)\\times10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$ and $(1.0\\pm0.2)\\times10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively.

Kobayashi, Hiroaki Yamamoto, Kengo Tachihara 13 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables, accepted for Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan (PASJ) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We report discovery of two CO clouds which are likely falling down to the Galactic plane at more than $35$ km s$^{-1}$. The clouds show head-tail distributions elongated perpendicular to the Galactic plane at $l=331.6^{\\circ}$ and $b=0^{\\circ}$ as revealed by an analysis of the Mopra CO $J=$1-0 survey data. We derived the distance of the clouds to be $2.46 \\pm 0.18$ kpc based on the Gaia Data Release 3. The CO clouds have molecular masses of $4.8\\times 10^3\\ M_{\\odot}$ and $3.5\\times 10^3\\ M_{\\odot}$, respectively, and show kinetic temperature of 30-50 K as derived from the line intensities of the $^{13}$CO $J$=2-1, $^{12}$CO $J$=1-0, and $^{13}$CO $J$=1-0 emission. The temperature in the heads of the clouds is significantly higher than 10 K of the typical molecular clouds, although no radiative heat source is found inside or close to the clouds. Based on the results, we interpret that the present clouds are falling onto the Milky Way disk and are significantly heated up by the strong shock interaction with the disk HI gas. We suggest that the clouds represent part of the HI intermediate velocity clouds falling to the Galactic plane which were converted into molecular clouds by shock compression. This is the first case of falling CO clouds having direct observed signatures of the falling motion including clear directivity and shock heating. Possible implications of the CO clouds in the evolution of the Galactic interstellar medium are discussed.",

Lindholm Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The evolution of the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) is a powerful probe of early star formation and stellar mass build-up. At z > 6, its bright end (MUV < -21) remains poorly constrained due to the small volumes of existing near-infrared (NIR) space-based surveys. The Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs) will cover 53 deg^2 with NIR imaging down to 26.5 AB, increasing area by a factor of 100 over previous space-based surveys. They thus offer an unprecedented opportunity to select bright z > 6 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and constrain the UV LF's bright end. With NIR coverage extending to 2um, Euclid can detect galaxies out to z = 13. We present forecasts for the number densities of z > 6 galaxies expected in the final EDF dataset. Using synthetic photometry from spectral energy distribution (SED) templates of z = 5--15 galaxies, z = 1--4 interlopers, and Milky Way MLT dwarfs, we explore optimal selection methods for high-z LBGs. A combination of S/N cuts with SED fitting (from optical to MIR) yields the highest-fidelity sample, recovering >76% of input z > 6 LBGs while keeping low-z contamination <10%. This excludes instrumental artefacts, which will affect early Euclid releases. Auxiliary data are critical: optical imaging from the Hyper Suprime-Cam and Vera C. Rubin Observatory distinguishes genuine Lyman breaks, while Spitzer/IRAC data help recover z > 10 sources. Based on empirical double power-law LF models, we expect >100,000 LBGs at z = 6-12 and >100 at z > 12 in the final Euclid release. In contrast, steeper Schechter models predict no z > 12 detections. We also present two ultra-luminous (MUV < -23.5) candidates from the EDF-N Q1 dataset. If their redshifts are confirmed, their magnitudes support a DPL LF model at z > 9, highlighting Euclid's power to constrain the UV LF's bright end and identify the most luminous early galaxies for follow-up.",

Website hosting interactive 3D visualizations now available and linked in the manuscript Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a detailed study of the 3D morphology of two extended associations of multiple protoclusters at $z=3.1$. These protocluster 'complexes', designated COSMOS-z3.1-A and COSMOS-z3.1-C, are the most prominent overdensities of $z=3.1$ Ly$\\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) identified in the COSMOS field by the One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey. These protocluster complexes have been followed up with extensive spectroscopy from Keck, Gemini, and DESI. Using a probabilistic method that combines photometrically selected and spectroscopically confirmed LAEs, we reconstruct the 3D structure of these complexes on scales of $\\approx$50 cMpc. We validate our reconstruction method using the IllustrisTNG300-1 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation and show that it consistently outperforms approaches relying solely on spectroscopic data. The resulting 3D maps reveal that both complexes are irregular and elongated along a single axis, emphasizing the impact of sightline on our perception of structure morphology. The complexes consist of multiple density peaks, ten in COSMOS-z3.1-A and four in COSMOS-z3.1-C. The former is confirmed to be a proto-supercluster, similar to {\\it Hyperion} at $z=2.4$ but observed at an even earlier epoch. Multiple `tails' connected to the cores of the density peaks are seen, likely representing cosmic filaments feeding into these extremely overdense regions. The 3D reconstructions further provide strong evidence that Ly$\\alpha$ blobs preferentially reside in the outskirts of the highest density regions. Descendant mass estimates of the density peaks suggest that COSMOS-z3.1-A and COSMOS-z3.1-C will evolve to become ultra-massive structures by $z=0$, with total masses $\\log(M/M_\\odot) \\gtrsim 15.3$, exceeding that of Coma.",

However, the high dimensionality of orbital parameters and observational constraints present significant challenges in statistically characterizing their properties. In this study, we propose and implement a novel algorithm, the Differential Velocity Cumulative Distribution (DVCD), to analyze binary star systems using radial velocity data. The DVCD method demonstrates superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches, reducing computation time by factors of $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-5}$ under comparable conditions. We applied the DVCD algorithm to red giant samples from APOGEE DR16, dividing the dataset into 16 subsets based on $\\log g$ and M/H. Our findings reveal that the binary fraction decreases with decreasing surface gravity and increasing metallicity, offering valuable constraints on the evolutionary processes of binary stars. This study underscores the potential of the DVCD method for large-scale statistical analyzes of binary systems.",

Herrero 19 pages, 16 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Modern spectroscopic surveys combined with Gaia distances are enabling reliable estimates of fundamental parameters for hundreds of Galactic O-type stars and the full range of spectral types and luminosity classes. Here we provide updated, statistically robust empirical calibrations of the fundamental parameters of Galactic O-type stars, as well as of their absolute visual magnitudes (Mv) and bolometric corrections (BC), based on high-quality observational data. We perform a homogeneous analysis of a sample of 358 Galactic O-type stars, combining high-resolution spectroscopy and Gaia distances. A subset of 234 stars meeting strict quality criteria involving parallax, extinction, and multi-band photometry was used to derive empirical calibrations of fundamental parameters. For those same stars, calibrated parameters were estimated from their measured Mv using the derived relations, allowing us to assess the internal consistency and predictive power of the calibrations. We present updated spectral-type-based calibrations of fundamental parameters for luminosity classes V, III, and I. Compared to previous works, we find systematic shifts, particularly in effective temperature for dwarfs and in Mv across all classes, which propagate into derived quantities. Applying the Mv calibrations to the full sample yields consistent estimates of radius and luminosity, while spectroscopic mass (Msp) shows significant scatter. We also evaluate the FW3414 parameter (from the Hbeta line) as a calibrator for Mv, useful in large surveys lacking reliable spectral classification. Excluding SB1 systems has a noticeable impact only on the Msp calibration for LC V. These updated empirical calibrations offer a robust reference for Galactic O-type stars and will support studies of massive star populations in both Galactic and extragalactic contexts, particularly in the era of large spectroscopic surveys.",

We present the physical properties of the target star using the short-cadence TESS data from sectors 24, 57, and 58, and our echelle spectra that show the presence of a tertiary companion. The spectral analysis led to the triple-lined radial velocities and the atmospheric parameters of the eclipsing components. Joint modeling of these observations reveals that the eclipsing pair contains two F-type stars with masses $1.564\\pm0.012$ $M_\\odot$ and $1.483\\pm0.012$ $M_\\odot$, radii $1.588\\pm0.011$ $R_\\odot$ and $1.500\\pm0.012$ $R_\\odot$, effective temperatures $7028\\pm100$ K and $7020\\pm110$ K, and luminosities $5.51\\pm0.32$ $L_\\odot$ and $4.90\\pm0.32$ $L_\\odot$. The light contributions of the three stars obtained from this modeling match well with those calculated from the observed spectra. The binary star parameters are in satisfactory agreement with evolutionary model predictions for age $t$ = 0.4 Gyr and metallicity $Z$ = 0.03. We extracted 11 significant frequencies from the TESS light residuals with the binary effects removed. Of these, five signals between 0.65 day$^{-1}$ and 1.89 day$^{-1}$ can be considered as $\\gamma$ Dor pulsations originating mainly from the primary component, while the other frequencies are likely instrumental artifacts or combination terms. These results suggest that TIC 322208686 is a hierarchical triple, containing a pulsating eclipsing pair and a tertiary companion.",

      "abstract": "Outbursts in ultra-compact AM CVn binaries Gavin Ramsay (Armagh Observatory and Planetarium) To be published in Proceedings of Science, 87th Fujihara Seminar: The 50th Anniversary Workshop of the Disk Instability Model in Compact Binary Stars Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) AM CVn binaries are the most compact of accreting binaries having orbital periods in the range ~5-70 min. They consist of a white dwarf accreting hydrogen deficient material from a degenerate or semi-degenerate star and are predicted to be amongst the verification sources for future gravitational wave observatories such as LISA. Using the recent catalogue of Green et al (2025) I focus attention on the orbital period range in which outbursts are seen from AM CVn's. I examine in more detail the outburst properties of KL Dra which has an outburst every few months and has many sectors of TESS data as an open resource. Using observational data on the outbursting systems in general, I compare the outburst recurrence time, duration and amplitude as a function of orbital period with the predictions of the disc instability model. The recurrence time is well described, although there is some evidence that the amount of material in the disc at the end of the quiescence phase is less than earlier model assumptions. The distribution of the outburst duration appears to be dependent on the cadence of the observations and how it is defined. Similarly the amplitude distribution is dependent on cadence and the filter, which causes an apparent spread in distribution. Both of these features need to be systematically studied using consistent benchmarks. AM CVn binaries remain an excellent sources to test models which aim to predict the properties of disc accreting systems.",

Ma (2) ((1) ETH Zurich, Institute for Particle Physics and Astrophysics, Zurich, Switzerland, (2) Univ. Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, IPAG, Grenoble, France) 29 pages, 25 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Many circumstellar dust scattering regions have been detected and investigated with polarimetric imaging. However, the quantitative determination of the intrinsic polarization and of dust properties is difficult because of complex observational effects. This work investigates instrumental convolution and polarimetric calibration effect for high contrast imaging polarimetry with the aim to define procedures for accurate measurements of the circumstellar polarization. For this we simulate the instrumental convolution and polarimetric cancellation effects for a Gaussian PSF and an extended PSF_{AO} typical for a modern adaptive optics system. Further, polarimetric zero-point corrections (zp-corrections) are simulated for different cases like coronagraphic observations or systems with barely resolved circumstellar scattering regions. We find that the PSF convolution reduces the integrated azimuthal polarization Q_phi for the scattering region while the net Stokes signals Q and U are not changed. For non-axisymmetric systems a spurious U_phi-signal is introduced. These effects are strong for compact systems but scattering regions can still be detected down to small separations while unresolved scattering regions can be constrained by the central Stokes Q,U signal. The smearing by PSF_{AO} produces an extended, low surface brightness polarization signal changing the angular distribution of the polarization, but the initial signal can be recovered partly from the Stokes Q and U quadrant pattern. A polarimetric zp-correction applied for the removal of offsets from instrumental or interstellar polarization depends on the selected reference region and can also introduce strong bias effects for the azimuthal distribution of the polarization signal. Strategies for the zp-correction are described for coronagraphic data or observations of partly unresolved systems.",

Townsend, Hongbo Xia, Jifeng Liu 11 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in ApJL Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We revisit the tidal evolution of the WASP-12 system using direct numerical calculations with the GYRE-tides code. WASP-12b is a hot Jupiter on a 1.1-day orbit around a slightly evolved F-type star. Its observed orbital decay rate, $|\\dot{P}_{\\rm orb}/P_{\\rm orb}| \\approx 3.2\\,\\mathrm{Myr}^{-1}$, provides a strong constraint on stellar tidal dissipation. We confirm that linear tides with radiative damping and convective damping, as currently implemented, are not sufficient to reproduce the observed inspiral timescale. Nevertheless, our calculations, based on fully non-adiabatic forced oscillations in MESA stellar models with convective envelopes, yield dissipation rates that are consistent with previous semi-analytic and adiabatic estimates, confirming the robustness of our numerical framework. As the only open-source, actively maintained tool capable of computing orbital evolution in exoplanet systems, GYRE-tides provides a benchmark calculation for WASP-12 and future applications. Our results validate GYRE-tides as a tool for analyzing combined radiative and convective damping, and indicate that the observed decay rate requires tidal dissipation operating in or near the fully damped regime, which may be achieved through nonlinear damping. These contributions could also be evaluated by computing the wave luminosity at the radiative-convective boundary using our tool. GYRE-tides offers an open-source framework for computing tidal dissipation in short-period exoplanet systems, including the many systems expected to show orbital decay in upcoming Roman surveys.",

Multiband $BVR_cI_c$ photometric data were obtained at an observatory in Mexico, from which new times of minima were determined. All target systems also had available space-based TESS time-series data. Orbital period variations were studied for eight target systems, showing either linear or parabolic trends. The target systems exhibiting parabolic trends demonstrated a sustained decrease in their orbital periods over time. We modeled the light curves utilizing the PHOEBE Python code in combination with the BSN application. We revisited the relationship between orbital period and the temperature of the hotter component in contact binary systems using an empirical approach. Our analysis identified a clear break at P=0.27 days, separating the systems into two distinct groups for orbital periods shorter than 0.6 days. Following the determination of stellar extinction, absolute parameters for seven systems were estimated employing parallax measurements from Gaia DR3. Based on the components' effective temperatures and masses, the systems were classified into A- and W-subtypes.

Meyers, Andrew Williams, Soham Dey, Naoto Nishizuka Submitted to Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia (PASA) Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Some of the most interesting insights into solar physics and space weather come from studying radio emissions associated with solar activity, which remain inherently unpredictable. Hence, a real-time triggering system is needed for solar observations with the versatile new-generation radio telescopes to efficiently capture these episodes of solar activity with the precious and limited solar observing time. We have developed such a system, Solar Triggered Observations of Radio bursts using MWA and Yamagawa (STROMY) for the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), the precursor for the low frequency telescope of upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO). It is based on near-real-time data from the Yamagawa solar spectrograph, located at a similar longitude to the MWA. We have devised, implemented, and tested algorithms to perform an effective denoising of the data to identify signatures of solar activity in the Yamagawa data in near real-time. End-to-end tests of triggered observations have been successfully carried out at the MWA. STORMY is operational at the MWA for the routine solar observations, a timely development in the view of the ongoing solar maximum. We present this new observing framework and discuss how it can enable efficient capturing of event-rich solar data with existing instruments, like the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), Owens Valley Radio Observatory - Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA) etc., and pave the way for triggered observing with the SKAO, especially the SKA-Low.",

Robbe-Dubois (the MATISSE Collaboration) 17 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The inner regions of planet-forming disks hold invaluable insights for our understanding of planet formation. The disk around the Herbig star HD 100453 presents one such environment, with an inner disk that is significantly misaligned with respect to the outer disk. This paper expands the existing H-band (PIONIER) and K-band (GRAVITY) interferometric studies of the HD 100453 inner disk to the L-band with the MATISSE VLTI instrument. With snapshot data spanning approximately four years we aim for a more comprehensive understanding of the inner disk structures and their potential time evolution. Based on the MATISSE data obtained, we use a combination of analytical models and image reconstruction to constrain the disk structure. Additionally, we fit a temperature gradient model to the selected wavelength range of PIONIER, GRAVITY and MATISSE to derive physical properties of the inner regions. Our parametric model finds an inclination of $\\sim 47.5^\\circ$ and a position angle of $\\sim 83.6^\\circ$, which corroborates the case of strong inner-outer disk misalignment. From the symmetric temperature gradient we derive an inner disk radius around $\\sim0.27$ au, with dust surface densities of $\\Sigma_{\\rm{subl}} \\approx 10^{-3.2}$ g/cm$^2$ and vertical optical depth $\\tau_{\\rm{z, subl}} \\approx 0.1-0.06$. Same-night MATISSE and GRAVITY observations indicate the necessity for higher-order asymmetries to explain the interferometric signals, which is further supported by a MATISSE snapshot image reconstruction. The chromatic interferometric data reveal the likely need for higher-order asymmetries to explain the inner disk of HD~100453, suggesting a possible origin in dynamic interactions or disk instabilities. Coordinated multi-wavelength infrared interferometric observations with GRAVITY and MATISSE will be crucial to confirm these findings and uncover its underlying nature.",

Saleem Khan Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (KoSO) is one of the oldest solar observatories, possessing an archive of multi-wavelength solar observations, including white light, Ca II K, and H-alpha images spanning over a century. In addition to these observations, KoSO has preserved hand-drawn suncharts (1904-2022), on which various solar features such as sunspots, plages, filaments, and prominences are marked on the Stonyhurst grid with distinct colour coding. In this study, we present the first comprehensive result that includes the entire data set from these suncharts using a supervised Machine Learning model called \"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\", firstly to identify the solar disks from the charts (1909-2007), secondly to identify the plages, spanning 9 solar cycles (1916-2007). We train the CNN with the manually identified solar disk and plage. We first detect the solar limb and the North-South line in the suncharts, which enables the extraction of disk centre coordinates, radius, and P-angle. Following that, we use a CNN similar architecture to achieve accurate image segmentation for the identification of plages. We compare plage areas derived from the suncharts with those obtained from Ca II K full-disk observations, and find good agreement that demonstrates the potential application of such an ML technique for historical data. The results of this study further demonstrate the potential application of sunchart data to fill the existing data gaps in the KoSO multi-wavelength observations and contribute toward constructing a composite series over the last century.",

We first tested the feasibility of our method using Fourier local correlation tracking (FLCT) to track physical quantities at different optical depths ($\\log\\tau_{500}={-1,-2,-3,-4}$) in an atmosphere simulated with the MURaM code. We then inferred the horizontal distribution of the LOS magnetic field component from synthetic spectropolarimetric observations of Fe I 525.0 nm and Mg I b2 spectral lines, applied FLCT to the time sequence of these synthetic magnetograms, and compared our findings with the original height-dependent horizontal velocities. Tracking the LOS magnetic field component (which coincides with the vertical component at the disk center) yields horizontal velocities that, after appropriate temporal and spatial averaging, agree excellently with the horizontal component of the simulated velocities, both calculated at constant $\\tau_{500}$ surfaces, up to the temperature minimum ($\\log\\tau_{500}=-3$). When tracking the temperature at constant $\\tau_{500}$ surfaces, this agreement already breaks down completely at the mid photosphere ($\\log\\tau_{500}=-2$). Tracking the vertical component of the magnetic field inferred from synthetic observations of the Fe I 525.0 nm and the Mg I b2 spectral lines yields a satisfactory inference of the horizontal velocities in the mid-photosphere ($\\log\\tau_{500}\\approx-1$) and the temperature minimum ($\\log\\tau_{500}\\approx-3$), respectively.

Schiavo et al 2025 ApJ 994 173 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Solar flares are explosive releases of magnetic energy stored in the solar corona, driven by magnetic reconnection. These events accelerate electrons, generating hard X-ray emissions and often display Quasi Periodic Pulsations (QPPs) across the energy spectra. However, the energy transfer process remains poorly constrained, with competing theories proposing different acceleration mechanisms. We investigate electron acceleration and transport in a flaring coronal loop by solving a time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation. Our model incorporates transient turbulent acceleration, simulating the effects of impulsive energy input to emulate the dynamics of time-dependent reconnection processes. We compute the density-weighted electron flux, a diagnostic directly comparable to observed X-ray emissions, across the energy and spatial domains from the corona to the chromosphere. We investigate different time-dependent functional forms of the turbulent acceleration, finding that the functional form of the acceleration source maintains its signature across energy bands (1 to 100 keV) with a response time that is energy dependent (with higher energy bands displaying a longer response time). In addition, we find that (a) for a square pulse the switch on and off response time is different; (b) for a sinusoidal input the periodicity is preserved; and (c) for a damped sinusoidal the decay rate increases with density and higher energy bands lose energy faster. This work presents a novel methodology for analyzing electron acceleration and transport in flares driven by time-dependent sources.",

Facchini Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Protoplanetary disks inherit their chemical composition from their natal molecular cloud, but the extent to which this material is preserved versus reset through chemical reprocessing remains an open question. Understanding this balance is a major topic in astrochemistry. Comparing the chemical composition of the envelope and the protoplanetary disk is key to solving the topic. The goal of this paper is to investigate the chemical differences between the disk and the surrounding envelope by comparing the column density ratios of a few selected species in each region. The source we focus on is HL Tau. We present new NOEMA observations of HL Tau targeting the following species: CS, H2CO, H2S, and SO2. We produced zeroth-, first-, and second-moment maps for the species where emission was detected and used them to analyze the spatial distribution and kinematic properties of the different molecules in the disk and the envelope. We derived the column densities and compared the values derived for the envelope and disk. We also computed the rotational diagram for the SO2 detected transitions. Assuming two different temperature regimes, 17 and 58 K, we derived column densities for the species surveyed in the disk and compared them with values derived for the envelope. We find large differences in the derived column density ratios of the surveyed molecules, especially for N(CS)/N(H2S), which is 40 to 50 times larger in the envelope. We attribute these variations to the different excitation and UV-irradiation regimes in the disk and envelope. We also note strong gradients in the ratios between different positions of the disk and tentatively attribute them to different levels of turbulence at different azimuths. The observed differences in molecular ratios in the envelope and the disk are suggestive of chemical reprocessing of the gas during the formation and evolution of the protoplanetary disk.",

Miller Bertolami, Margarida Cunha Submitted to Experimental Astronomy, Comments welcome Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present the scientific case for exploiting the capabilities of the PLATO mission to study bright pulsating white dwarfs across a wide spectral range, including hydrogen-deficient types (GW Vir and DBV stars) and hydrogen-rich classes (classical DAVs, pulsating extremely low-mass DA white dwarfs, and ultra-massive DA white dwarfs). PLATOs exceptional photometric precision, long-duration continuous monitoring, and extensive sky coverage promise transformative advances in white dwarf asteroseismology. Our key objectives include probing the internal structure and chemical stratification of white dwarfs, detecting secular changes in pulsation modes over extended timescales, and discovering rare or previously unknown classes of pulsators. To assess feasibility, we constructed a sample of 650 white dwarf candidates identified within PLATOs Southern LOPS2 field using the PLATO complementary science catalogue combined with Gaia DR3, and derived atmospheric parameters through photometric modeling. This sample comprises 118 DA white dwarfs (including 23 ZZ Ceti candidates), and 41 non-DAs (including 35 DBV candidates). Simulated observations using PlatoSim demonstrate that PLATO will be capable of detecting white dwarf pulsation modes with amplitudes as low as 0.1 mma depending on stellar magnitude, observation duration, pixel location, and the number of contributing cameras. We provide detailed detection limits and visibility forecasts for known pulsators across a representative range of these parameters. Furthermore, we emphasize strong synergies with Gaia astrometry, TESS photometry, and targeted spectroscopic campaigns, which together will enable robust mode identification and detailed stellar modeling. Collectively, these efforts will unlock unprecedented insights into white dwarf origins, evolution and internal physics, and the fate of their planetary systems.",

Phys., 227, 106653, 2025 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Sunspots depict large variability during the last 100 years, a period called the Modern Maximum (MM). However, other variables are needed to study the long-term evolution, e.g., of weaker fields and different radiative emissions. Recently, the relation between sunspots and the F10.7 and F30 radio fluxes and the MgII index (proxies of EUV irradiance) was found to vary during the last 70 years so that a relative sunspot dominance over EUV in the 1950s-1960s changed to EUV dominance in the 2000s (Mursula et al., 2024). Here we use data from eight long-operating observatories to calculate the yearly range of daily variation of the geomagnetic Y-component, the rY index, for the last 137 years. The rY index correlates very well with the MgII index and the solar F30 radio flux. These three indices have no trend relative to each other. On the other hand, the F10.7 flux has a significant trend with respect to the three co-varying EUV indices (MgII, F30, rY). Therefore, the rY index replaces F10.7 as the best long-term EUV proxy, and extends the MgII index by 90 years. We verify that all the four EUV proxies (rY, MgII, F30, F10.7) have an increasing trend with respect to sunspots during the last 50-70 years. This is valid both for sunspot numbers and group numbers. We find that the relation between rY index and sunspots has a quadratic evolution over the MM. The Sun has more sunspots relative to EUV irradiance during the growth and maximum of the MM, while the opposite is true during its decay. We estimate that the MgII index increases by 24\\% of its solar cycle variation with respect to the sunspot number during the last 70 years. Our results indicate a systematic difference in the evolution between sunspots (photosphere) and plages (chromosphere) with long-term solar activity. The implied varying spot-facula ratio has consequences to the stellar evolution of the Sun and Sun-like stars.",

NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) adds a unique combination of long baseline and all-sky coverage, though extracting light curves from full-frame images (FFIs) is challenging due to scattered light and blending. We processed TESS FFIs to produce TEQUILA (TESS quick-look and light curve analysis), a comprehensive catalog of variable point sources from the prime mission, enabling diverse studies without requiring raw data processing. We used difference image analysis, constructing reference images from quality-filtered FFIs for each CCD across sectors 1-26. Iterative subtraction mitigated systematics, and light curves were created using aperture photometry for sources varying in residual images. The pipeline yields over six million light curves, including stellar variables, transients, systematics, and moving objects. Approximately $6 \\times 10^5$ span multiple sectors, with roughly $10^3$ from continuous viewing zones. We achieve median differential variability noise of $10^{-3}$ to $10^0$ for sources between 5.0 and 16.0 Tmag, while typical photometric RMS variability ranges from $10^{-2}$ to $10^1$. A convolutional neural network identifies light curves caused by instrumental noise, assigning a confidence score to each classification. To avoid confusion with astrophysical variables, we also flag light curves prompted by known Solar System objects (SSOs). All light curves are accessible via MAST as a High-Level Science Product. This catalog serves as a discovery tool for new variables; future work will refine methods and extend coverage to the TESS extended mission.",

Upton, Greg Kopp, Odele Coddington 17 Pages, 11 Figures, Accepted for Publication in ApJ; Contact Authors for the Data Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The historical reconstruction of the Sun's surface magnetic field remains a persistent challenge, limiting our ability to investigate the long-term global properties of the Sun, including the evolution of the large-scale magnetic field, solar cycle prediction, reconstruction of total solar irradiance (TSI), and secular solar variability. In this study, we employ the Advective Flux Transport (AFT) model in conjunction with our newly developed Synthetic Active Region Generator (SARG) to construct a catalog of synthetic active regions (ARs) spanning Solar Cycles 1-24 (1755-2020). We use the SIDC/SILSO sunspot number version 2.0 as the sole input governing the properties of the synthetic ARs in this catalog. This SARG catalog is then incorporated into the AFT model, which simulates the emergence of new ARs on the Sun, which are then transported under the influence of surface flows to produce maps of the full-Sun radial photospheric magnetic field over the entire 265-year period. We modulate the active region tilt for each cycle in order to ensure that the polar fields are consistent with the solar cycle amplitudes. We find that the polar fields derived from these simulations exhibit excellent correlation (r > 0.8) with observational proxies, including polar faculae counts and Ca ii K polar network indices. Daily synchronic maps from these simulations for the entire 265-year period are made publicly available to support a wide range of applications beyond those presented in this work.",

Schlaufman 24 pages, 13 figures, accepted in ApJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The relationship between the composition of rocky exoplanets and their host stars is fundamental to understanding planetary formation and evolution. However, previous studies have been limited by inconsistent datasets, observational biases and methodological differences. This study investigates the compositional relationship between rocky exoplanets and their host stars, utilizing a self-consistent and homogeneous dataset of 21 exoplanets and their 20 host stars. By applying sophisticated interior structure modeling and comprehensive chemical analysis, we identify a potential 1:1 best-fit line between the iron-mass fraction of planets and their host stars equivalent with a slope of $m = 0.94^{+1.02}_{-1.07}$ and intercept of $c = -0.02^{+0.31}_{-0.29}$. This results are consistent at the 1$\\sigma$ level with other homogeneous studies, but not with heterogeneous samples that suggest much steeper best-fit lines. Although, our results remain tentative due to sample size and data uncertainties, the updated dataset significantly reduces the number of super-Mercuries from four to one, but it remains that several high-density planets are beyond what a primordial origin would suggest. The planets in our sample have a wider range of compositions compared to stellar equivalent values, that could indicate formation pathways away from primordial or be the result of random scattering owing to current mass-radius uncertainties as we recover the observed outliers in mock population analysis $\\sim15\\%$ of the time. To truly determine whether the origin is primordial with a 1:1 true relation, we find that sample of at least 150 planets is needed and that stars that are iron enrich or depleted are high value targets.",

Submitted to A&A. Revised version after the first-round referee report Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Earth-like exoplanets can create resonant structures in exozodiacal dust through mean motion resonances (MMRs). These structures not only suggest the presence of such planets, but also act as potential noise sources in future mid-infrared (MIR) nulling interferometry observations. We aim to investigate how resonant structures in exozodiacal dust vary across stellar spectral types (F4--M4), and to evaluate how stellar wind drag affects their morphology and brightness in mature planetary systems. We conducted numerical simulations of dust dynamics, extending earlier studies by including spectral type variation in stellar wind drag in addition to Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag. Our models represented systems of a few Gyr hosting an Earth-like exoplanet in the habitable zone (HZ). We produced spatially resolved maps of optical depth and thermal emission for different stellar spectral types. Our simulations showed that resonant ring structures were formed for all stellar spectral types considered. In particular, we found that stellar wind drag played a critical role in shaping dust dynamics around old M-type stars, where it could dominate over PR drag by a factor of approximately 44. This reduced the contrast of resonant rings relative to the background disk, compared to cases without spectral type variation in stellar wind. Across different spectral types, the optical depth contrast of the resonant ring increased for lower-mass stars, assuming a fixed background level. Asymmetric thermal emission distributions were derived across all spectral types, which peaked for K-type stars. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating both resonant dynamics and stellar wind effects when modeling exozodiacal dust around stars of different spectral types.",

Giant planets and brown dwarfs produce large Doppler signatures that are easily detectable by modern instrumentation, and legacy radial velocity (RV) surveys have now achieved full orbital coverage for periods $\\lesssim$30 years. However, the Doppler method's sensitivity to companion minimum mass $M_c \\sin i$ -- as opposed to true mass $M_c$ -- prevents unambiguous characterization using RVs alone, as purported giant planets may be brown dwarfs or stars on inclined orbits. Here we combined legacy RVs with absolute astrometry to re-fit the orbits of 195 companions from the California Legacy Survey. Nearly 50% (8/18) of the ``brown dwarfs\" ($M_c \\sin i$=13--80 $M_{Jup}$) we refit had true masses above 80 $M_{Jup}$. We incorporated our orbital posteriors and target sensitivity maps into a Poisson likelihood model to calculate occurrence as a function of true companion mass $M_c$ (0.8--80 $M_{Jup}$) and separation $a$ (0.3--30 AU). The semi-major axis distributions of objects in this range vary smoothly with mass, with Jupiter analogs favoring an abrupt increase in occurrence near 1 AU and brown dwarfs exhibiting a gradual enhancement at wider separations. Marginalized companion occurrence between 1--10 AU decreases smoothly with mass, with brown dwarfs having the lowest occurrence rate: $0.9^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$%. Jupiter analogs are 10 times as common as brown dwarfs per mass interval in this range, demonstrating that the brown dwarf desert extends to 10 AU. The smooth variation in these distributions disfavors a sharp transition mass between ``bottom-up\" core accretion and ``top-down\" gravitational instability formation mechanisms, and rather suggests that these processes may produce companions in overlapping mass ranges.",

Here we develop a Lagrangian framework based on the Virial theorem to show that planetary orbital angular momentum modulates the Sun's rotation through barycentric dynamics, consistent with angular momentum conservation. Using Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) applied to sunspot number (SSN) and terrestrial length-of-day (LOD) records spanning the past 250 years, we identify two non-linear trends plus 11 common pseudo-cycles whose periods match those of planetary resonances (LR$^{*}$). We then demonstrate that a reduced nonlinear $\\alpha-\\Omega$ dynamo model, forced solely by the summed planetary right ascension RA(t), reproduces both the Schwabe cycle and its multi-decadal envelope, including the Dalton Minimum and the Modern Maximum. These results provide strong evidence, based on a physically-grounded model, that the solar dynamo is weakly forced by planetary motion, suggesting that the solar dynamo, classically viewed as autonomous, may in fact behave as a synchronized system.",

We conducted a 67-night, 199-day baseline white-light monitoring campaign centred on the globular cluster M3 aimed at characterizing stellar variability within the cluster while also assessing the photometric performance of the newly commissioned system. We report the discovery of four new SX Phoenicis variables (V301-304), confirm their cluster membership, and identify fundamental-mode pulsation in one, allowing an independent period-luminosity-based distance estimate to M3. We revisited 231 previously known RR Lyrae stars, providing updated period measurements for 203 and white-light amplitudes for 198. We detected Blazhko-like modulation in 53 stars and characterized the modulation parameters for 28. Notably, we measure periods and amplitudes for the unclassified variables V286 and V287 for the first time. We also identify three foreground flaring M dwarfs, and assess the feasibility of detecting microlensing events in M3, concluding that expected rates are negligible. Alongside the scientific results, we introduce a new correction technique for flat-field images affected by scattered light and present a full characterization of the observatory's photometric capabilities. These results demonstrate the scientific utility of TWIST for high-cadence time-domain surveys using modest-aperture instrumentation.",

Updated 21/11/2025 to fix a typo in base density value Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present a detailed analysis of the early post-mass-transfer binary HD 698 (V742 Cas) combining high-resolution optical spectroscopy, long-baseline interferometry, and radiative-transfer modeling. Counter-phased radial-velocity curves yield a circular orbit with P=55.927+/-0.001 d and component masses M_Be=7.48+/-0.07 M_sun and M_comp=1.23+/-0.02 M_sun. The Be primary is traced by broad H alpha wings, while narrow metallic absorption lines arise from a slowly rotating companion. The interferometric separation implies a dynamical distance of 888+/-5 pc. The spectral energy distribution is reproduced with E(B-V)=0.321+/-0.016 and a viscous decretion disk of base density rho_0~5x10^-12 g cm^-3 at r=R_eq, declining radially as rho(r)~r^-n with n=3.0. The companion is luminous and inflated, with T_eff=10.0(+0.2,-0.1) kK, R_comp=13.1+/-0.2 R_sun, and log(L/L_sun)=3.19, contributing significantly to the flux (L_comp/L_Be~0.3). Spectral line mismatches further suggest a hydrogen-poor, CNO-processed atmosphere, consistent with a stripped-envelope star. HD 698 thus adds to the emerging class of Be+bloated OB binaries, capturing a brief post-mass-transfer phase when the donor remains spectroscopically detectable prior to the subdwarf stage.",

      "abstract": "Synthesis imaging with a lunar orbit array: I. global sky map and its systematics Furen Deng, Yidong Xu, Fengquan Wu, Yanping Cong, Bin Yue, Xuelei Chen Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Ground-based radio astronomical observation at frequencies below 30 MHz is hampered by the Ionosphere and radio frequency interference (RFI). The Discovering Sky at the Longest wavelength (DSL) mission, also known as the Hongmeng mission, employs a linear array of satellites on a circular orbit around the Moon to make interferometric observations in this band. Though vastly different from the usual ground-based arrays, the interferometric visibility data collected by such an array is linearly related to the sky map, and the reconstruction is in principle an inversion problem of linear mapping. In this paper, we investigate a number of issues in the algorithm of global map reconstruction, focusing on the impact of sub-pixel noise induced by the finite pixelization of the sky, and errors due to regularization. We find that in the reconstruction process, if one builds up the beam matrix, which relates the sky pixels to the visibilities, by naively evaluating its elements at each of the pixel centers, then the sub-pixel noise can give rise to a significant aliasing effect. However, this effect can be effectively mitigated by a simple pixel-averaging method. Based on evaluation of the image quality using the correlation coefficient between the input and reconstructed map, and the signal-to-noise ratio, we discuss the selection strategy of the regularization parameter, and show that the sky can be well reconstructed with a reasonable choice of the regularization parameter.",

      "abstract": "TDLight: A Framework for Incremental Light Curve Management and Smart Classification Xinghang Yu, Ce Yu, Zeguang Shao, Bin Yang Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) With the exponential growth of time-domain surveys, the volume of light curves has increased rapidly. However, many survey projects, such as Gaia, still rely on offline batch-processing workflows in which data are calibrated, merged, and released only after an observing phase is completed. This latency delays scientific analysis and causes many high-value transient events to be buried in archival data, missing the window for timely follow-up. While existing alert brokers handle heterogeneous data streams, it remains difficult to deploy a unified framework that combines high-performance incremental storage with real-time classification on local infrastructure. To address this challenge, we propose TDLight, a scalable system that adapts the time-series database TDengine (a high-performance IoT database) for astronomical data using a one-table-per-source schema. This architecture supports high-throughput ingestion, achieving 954,000 rows s^-1 for archived data and 541,000 rows s^-1 for incremental streams, while Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization (HEALPix) indexing enables efficient cone-search queries. Building on this storage layer, we integrate the pre-trained hierarchical Random Forest classifier from the LEAVES framework to construct an incremental classification pipeline. Using the LEAVES dataset, we simulate data accumulation and evaluate a trigger-based strategy that performs early classification at specific observational milestones. In addition, by monitoring the evolution of classification probabilities, the system identifies \"high-value candidates\" -- sources that show high early confidence but later undergo significant label shifts. TDLight is released as an open-source Dockerized environment, providing a deployable infrastructure for next-generation time-domain surveys.",

Wallack, Nicholas Wogan Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) JWST has already observed near-infrared transmission spectra of over a dozen super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. While some observations have allowed astronomers to characterize sub-Neptunes in unprecedented detail, small feature amplitudes and poorly-understood systematics have led to ambiguous results for others. Using the first seven targets from the COMPASS program, which is currently surveying 12 small planet atmospheres using NIRSpec/G395H, we investigate these timeseries systematics. We implement a model that uses the principle components of the normalized pixel fluxes to account for variations in the shape and position of the spectral trace. We find that observations with a smaller number of groups-per-integration benefit most profoundly from the use of this model, and that systematics are particularly strong between 2.8 and 3.5 $\\mu$m. Despite these systematics, \\texttt{pandexo} is a relatively accurate predictor of the precision of the spectra, with real error bars on average 5\\% larger in NRS1 and 12\\% larger in NRS2 than predicted. We compute new limits on metallicity and opaque pressure level for each target and compare these to previous results from the COMPASS program. Next, we co-add spectra from multiple targets to reduce the effective noise in the combined spectra in hopes of detecting transmission features in common between the targets, but this exercise does not yield compelling evidence any signals. We find that a handful of additional transits are sufficient to break the degeneracy between metallicity and aerosols for the majority of our targets, pointing towards the possibility of unraveling the mysteries of these worlds with future allocations of JWST time.",

      "abstract": "Inferring Magnetic Field Morphology and Dust Scattering Geometry from Mid-IR Polarimetry: the Extended Aitken Method Frank Városi, Charles M. Telesco, Christopher M. Wright, Sergio José Fernández Acosta Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The Aitken method is a useful approach for decomposing mid-IR polarimetry of silicates in astronomical sources into emissive and absorptive components. Here we extend this method to include the effects of polarization caused by scattering from graphite or similar particles along the same sightlines. To demonstrate the extended method, we apply it in the analysis of CanariCam multi-wavelength imaging polarimetry observations of the Egg Nebula, W3 IRS5, and W51 IRS2, and also spectropolarimetry of W3 IRS5. We compare these results with those obtained with the original Aitken method and show that the Egg Nebula observations are fit better when this third component is incorporated into the analysis. Polarimetry observations of W3 IRS5 are also fit better with the extended Aitken method, but the original method suffices to fit many sightlines. Observations of W51 IRS2 are fit well by either the original or extended Aitken method. Including scattering by dust in the decomposition of polarimetry observations of the Egg Nebula and W3 IRS5 produces better results for the emissive and absorptive components, and in particular for the position angle (PA) of those components. The distribution of the difference between absorptive and emissive PA is then found to be more peaked at a single angle, nearly perpendicular. This supports the theory that mid-IR polarization arises from elongated dust grains aligned along magnetic field lines, since then the PA of emissive and absorptive polarization would be perpendicular. When significant scattering is not present the extended method produces the same results as the original method.",

This paper presents a comprehensive trade-off analysis of lunar frozen-orbit constellations for the Lunar Augmented Navigation Service (LANS), focusing on how the number of satellites and orbital parameters influence coverage, position dilution of precision (PDOP), orbit determination accuracy, receiver noise, and orbit insertion cost. Three Walker-constellation families based on frozen elliptical and circular orbits are examined to characterize their relative advantages across different semi-major axes and inclinations. Results show that larger semi-major axes enhance both polar and global coverage, though the optimal inclination depends on the constellation type and target service region. The south elliptical lunar frozen orbit (ELFO) Walker constellation provides superior performance for polar coverage and PDOP, whereas the circular lunar frozen orbit (CLFO) Walker configuration achieves the best global uniformity. Orbit determination errors and receiver noise both increase with larger semi-major axes and higher inclinations, reflecting weaker geometric observability and reduced received signal power at apolune for eccentric orbits. Orbit insertion analysis reveals clear trade-offs among transfer duration, characteristic energy ($C_3$) at trans-lunar injection, and insertion $\\Delta V$: shorter transfers require higher insertion $\\Delta V$, while low-energy transfers achieve smaller $\\Delta V$ at the cost of months-long durations and higher $C_3$. These findings provide a systematic framework for designing LANS constellations for both regional and global coverage.",

Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time require photometric calibration that is both long-term stable and spatially uniform at the sub-percent level, even during non-photometric conditions. Achieving this precision motivates new approaches to characterize atmospheric transmission, particularly to mitigate gray extinction from clouds. The StarDICE experiment aims to establish a metrology chain linking laboratory standards to astrophysical fluxes with 1 mmag accuracy in the $\\textit{griz}$ bands, a goal for which controlling variable atmospheric effects is essential. We present a method that corrects photometric measurements using simultaneous radiometric information from an infrared thermal camera. The gray-extinction model is fit on an image-by-image basis using thermal radiance excess and the difference between synthetic and instrumental fluxes of calibration stars, without requiring assumptions about the spatial structure of extinction. The method relies on a forward model that incorporates environmental monitoring, radiative-transfer simulations, and Gaia DR3 stellar catalogs. Using data from a remote observing system that repeatedly monitored two fields under diverse atmospheric conditions, we show that the corrections reduce residuals between corrected and reference magnitudes and produce extinction maps with 2-arcmin resolution and $\\sim$0.01 mag accuracy. Using this technique, we can recover data acquired under non-photometric conditions with a precision comparable to data obtained under photometric conditions. For the most affected exposures, the mean absolute error improves from 0.64 to 0.11 mag, and temporal extinction variations can be reduced to 0.025 mag per source. We discuss the implications of this technique for future surveys and outline directions for further refinement.",

To address this challenge, we develop a deep learning framework based on a residual one-dimensional convolutional neural network for lensed GW identification under multiband observations. The model directly processes multiband waveforms from binary neutron star systems, covering the early inspiral observed by the DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO) and the late inspiral observed by the Einstein Telescope (ET), corresponding approximately to the wave-optics and geometrical-optics regimes, respectively. It enables end-to-end classification of five classes: pure noise, unlensed GWs, and three representative lensed GWs corresponding to singular isothermal sphere (SIS), cored isothermal sphere (CIS), and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles. A dataset of 10^6 simulated samples was constructed with signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) ranging from 5 to 100. The deep learning model with multiband observations achieves an accuracy of 97.0% and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.97, significantly exceeding the single-detector performance, where DECIGO and ET reach 72.8% and 62.3%, respectively. Even in the low-SNR regime (SNR < 20), the model maintains an accuracy above 63%, while in the high-SNR regime (SNR > 80), its accuracy approaches 99.8%. These results demonstrate that multiband GW observations effectively enhance the detection of lensed GWs within complex noise environments, providing a robust and efficient pathway for the automated identification of lensed GWs in future multiband observations.",

Gordon, Clara Sousa-Silva Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Cassini's observations of Titan's atmosphere are exemplary benchmarks for exoplanet atmospheric studies owing to (1) their precision and (2) our independent knowledge of Titan. Leveraging these observations, we perform retrievals (i.e., analyses) of Titan's transmission spectrum to investigate the strengths/limitations of exoplanet atmospheric retrievals with a particular focus on the underlying assumptions regarding the molecular species included in the retrieval. We find that multiple hydrocarbons can be ``retrieved'' depending on the selection made ahead of a retrieval. More importantly, we find that the estimates of other parameters such as the abundance of key absorbers like methane can be biased by $\\sim$0.5 dex (by a factor of $\\sim$3) due to such choices. This shows that beyond the possible misidentification of a molecular feature (e.g., current debate surrounding dimethyl sulfide, DMS, in K2-18 b), the implicit molecular detections made pre-retrieval to avoid retrieving for hundreds of molecules at a time can bias a large range of parameters. We thus recommend sensitivity analysis to assess the dependencies of atmospheric inferences on such selections in tandem with complementary information (e.g., chemistry models) to support any pre-retrieval selection. Finally, we introduce an independent path to constrain the dominant atmospheric constituent, even when lacking observable absorption feature (e.g., H$_2$ and N$_2$) through the scale height.",

In this work, we investigate phase noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations in the atoms' transverse motion in the presence of the wavefront curvature of the interferometer beam, and analyse its dependence on the laser-beam geometry in long-baseline, large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers. We use a semi-classical framework to derive analytical expressions for the effective phase perturbation in position-averaged measurements and validate them using Monte Carlo simulations. Applied to 100-m and 1-km atom gradiometers representative of next-generation experiments, the model shows that configurations maximizing pulse efficiency also amplify curvature-induced phase noise, requiring micron-level control of the atom cloud's centre-of-mass position and sub-micron-per-second control of its centre-of-mass velocity to achieve sub-$10^{-5}$ rad phase stability. Alternative beam geometries can suppress this noise by up to two orders of magnitude, but at the cost of reduced pulse efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a mitigation strategy based on position-resolved phase-shift readout, which empirically learns and corrects the wavefront-induced bias from measurable quantities such as the phase-shift gradient and final cloud position. This approach restores high-sensitivity operation in the maximum-pulse-efficiency configuration without detailed beam characterisation, providing a practical route towards next-generation, time-resolved atom interferometers operating at the $10^{-5}$ rad noise level.",

In this study, we examine Kepler-1624b, a sub-Saturn orbiting an M dwarf that was previously found to exhibit transit timing variations with an amplitude of approximately 2 minutes, suggesting the presence of a nearby non-transiting companion. We reanalyze the transits from archival Kepler data and extend the TTV baseline by 11 years by combining TESS data with three new ground-based transit observations from Palomar and Las Cumbres Observatories. We jointly fit these datasets and find that the TTV amplitude is significantly weaker in our updated analysis. We calculate the Bayes factor for a one-planet versus two-planet model and find that the one-planet model is preferred. Our results highlight the need for careful analysis of systems with relatively low amplitude TTV signals that are identified in large automated catalogs.",

However, synchronisation can be achieved also via tidal approach, provided the Roche limit is not crossed. For each of the two scenarios, hereafter referred to as Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, respectively, we derive the condition under which the evolving synchronicity radius catches up with the tidally evolving orbit. We consider these two scenarios for the Pluto-Charon system, examine the impact origin hypothesis of Charon's formation, and propose that capture is a likelier option. We investigate Scenario 2, both analytically and numerically, where the orbital evolution of Charon starts at a higher altitude than present and undergoes tidal descent. In Scenario 2, the greater initial orbital separation between the partners reduces tidally induced thermal processes and fracturing, as compared to Scenario 1. In several study cases, we also observe temporary locking of Charon into higher spin-orbit resonances (3:2 to 7:2) in the first 0.5Myr of the system's evolution.",

In the planetary science literature, the ratio of these quantities is known as the phase integral. It has been extensively measured for the Solar System planets and shown to generally be non-unity in value. We use existing Cassini data of Jupiter to derive bandpass-integrated geometric albedos and phase integrals in the CHEOPS, TESS and Ariel bandpasses, demonstrating that these quantities vary markedly across these different wavelength ranges. By performing a population study of geometric albedos and phase integrals, we demonstrate that atmospheres with partial cloud cover may be identified using measurements of the phase integral if its measured uncertainty is $\\sim 0.1$, which corresponds to an uncertainty of $\\sim 3\\%$ on the optical/visible secondary eclipse depth.

Icy bodies display a remarkable diversity of geological, geophysical, and atmospheric processes, which differ fundamentally from those of the rocky terrestrial planets. Evidence from past and ongoing spacecraft missions has revealed subsurface oceans, cryovolcanic activity, and tenuous but persistent atmospheres, showing that icy bodies are active and evolving worlds. At the same time, major questions remain unresolved, including the chemical properties of icy materials, the geological histories of their surfaces, and the coupling between internal evolution and orbital dynamics. Current knowledge of the surfaces, interiors, and atmospheres of the principal icy bodies is built on spacecraft measurements, telescopic observations, laboratory experiments, and theoretical modeling. Recent contributions from Juno, JWST, and stellar occultation studies have added valuable constraints on atmospheric composition, interior structure, and surface activity. Looking ahead, missions such as JUICE, Europa Clipper, Dragonfly, and the Uranus Orbiter and Probe are expected to deliver substantial progress in the study of icy bodies. Their findings, combined with continued Earth- and space-based observations and laboratory studies, will be critical for assessing the potential habitability of these environments and for placing them within a broader framework of planetary system formation and evolution.",

Owen, James Kirk Accepted for publication in MNRAS Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Transmission spectroscopy of sub-Neptunes was expected to reveal their compositions and hence origins, yet many show flat near- to mid-infrared spectra. Such spectra can be explained either by metal dominated atmospheres or by high-altitude, grey aerosols. Observations of escaping hydrogen and helium from several of these planets rule out metal dominated atmospheres, while homogeneous distributions of small aerosols cannot produce flat spectra and large particles require unphysically high production rates. We investigate the role of heterogeneous, \"clumpy\" aerosol distributions in shaping transmission spectra. Modestly optically thick clumps at high altitudes can produce flat spectra even with small particles and physically realistic production rates. Clumping increases the effective photon mean-free path while reducing wavelength dependence, allowing the aerosol distribution to behave as an effective grey absorber. Applying this framework to the sub-Neptune TOI-776c, we show that clumpy aerosols can reconcile the observed flattening of its transmission spectrum with a primordial H/He-dominated atmosphere. We further discuss implications for emission spectra, where enhanced stellar radiation penetration and altered scattering in a clumpy medium could produce observable signatures. These results suggest that clumpy aerosol distributions naturally resolve the tension between flat spectra and low-metallicity atmospheres and may be a common feature of sub-Neptune exoplanets. More broadly, our results highlight the need to consider aerosol heterogeneity when interpreting high-altitude microphysics and the spectral appearance of exoplanet atmospheres with JWST, and motivate theoretical work to identify the physical mechanisms capable of generating clumpy aerosol distributions.",

This suggests that these disks are optically thick in mm-band, an interpretation further supported by their near-black-body spectral indexes. Such characteristics are seen not only among disks in very young star-forming regions like Lupus (1-3 Myrs), but, as we demonstrate here, also among disks in the much older Upper Scorpius region (5-11 Myrs). How can disks shine brightly for so long, when grain growth and subsequent radial drift should have quickly depleted their solid reservoir? Here, we suggest that the \"bouncing barrier\" provides the answer. Even colliding at very low speeds (below 1cm/s), grains already fail to stick to each other but instead bounce off in-elastically. This barrier stalls grain growth at a near-universal size of 100 micron. These small grains experience much reduced radial drift, and so are able to keep the disks bright for millions of years. They are also tightly coupled to gas, offering poor prospects for processes like streaming instability or pebble accretion. We speculate briefly on how planetesimals can arise in such a bath of 100-micron grains.",

Rafikov, Richard P. Nelson 12 pages, 9 figures. Accepted in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The ring and gap structures found in observed protoplanetary disks are often attributed to embedded gap-opening planets and typically modeled with simplified thermodynamics in the 2D, thin disk approximation. However, it has been shown that radiative cooling and meridional processes play key roles in planet-disk interaction, though their computational cost has limited their exploration. We investigate the differences between 2D and 3D models of gap-opening planets while also comparing thermodynamical frameworks ranging from locally isothermal to fully radiative. We also compare simplified cooling recipes to fully radiative models in an effort to motivate the inclusion of radiative effects in future modeling even in a parametrized manner. We perform hydrodynamical simulations in both 2D and 3D, and then compare the angular momentum deposition by planetary spirals to assess gap opening efficiency. We repeat comparisons with different thermodynamical treatments: locally isothermal, adiabatic, local beta cooling, and fully radiative including radiative diffusion. We find that 2D models are able to capture the essential physics of gap opening with remarkable accuracy, even when including full radiation transport in both cases. Simple cooling prescriptions can capture the trends found in fully radiative models, albeit slightly overestimating gap opening efficiency near the planet. Inherently 3D effects such as vertical flows that cannot be captured in 2D can explain the differences between the two approaches, but do not impact gap opening significantly. Our findings encourage the use of models that include radiative processes in the study of planet-disk interaction, even with simplified yet physically motivated cooling prescriptions in lieu of full radiation transport. This is particularly important in the context of substructure-inducing planets in the ALMA-sensitive disk regions (>10 au).",

This work provides a framework to characterize cloud and climate properties of close-in gas giants via transit depth asymmetries from the optical to the infrared (0.33 ...10 $\\mu$m). The AFGKM ExoRad 3D GCM grid provides gas temperature profiles for an ensemble of 50 tidally locked gaseous planets orbiting diverse host stars. It is combined with a detailed kinetic cloud formation model. The end result is a set of synthetic transit spectra and evening-to-morning transit asymmetries that span climate regimes: warm (T=800 K ... 1000K), intermediately hot (T=1200 K ... 2000 K) and ultrahot (T =2200 K ... 2600 K). WASP-39b observations suggest iron-free clouds with less abundant cloud condensation nuclei than previously expected. The ensemble study shows that clouds increase transit limb differences due to asymmetries in cloud coverage and by enhancing horizontal differences in the gas temperatures. For hot planets, evening-to-morning differences of up to 150 ppm are suggested in the optical and 100 ppm in the infrared (2-8 micron). For ultra-hot Jupiters, evening-to-morning transit differences are dominated by the morning cloud for a cloud-free evening limb: They are strongly negative in the PLATO band (0.5-1~$\\mu$m, -500 ppm), moderately negative in the near-infrared (1-1.5~$\\mu$m, -200 ppm) and moderately positive (+100 ppm) for $\\lambda > 2\\mu$m. For a partly cloudy evening terminator, the evening-to-morning transit asymmetry is moderately positive in the whole wavelength range. Warm Jupiter planets exhibit negligible transit asymmetries. PLATO and JWST transit asymmetry observations between 1-2 $\\mu$m are optimal to characterize cloudy planetary atmospheres around K -A stars. JWST observations are most effective for M star planets with transit differences > +500 ppm for 8-10 $\\mu$m.",
