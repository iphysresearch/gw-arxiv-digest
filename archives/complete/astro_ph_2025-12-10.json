Non-thermal electrons are assumed to be energized from the thermal background through magnetic reconnection, with pitch-angle distributions modeled as beamed or loss-cone types, alongside an isotropic case for comparison. The results show that non-thermal emission can produce pronounced flux outbursts and localized brightening during eruptions, while the associated increase in optical depth can suppress the linear polarization fraction. Introducing pitch-angle anisotropy further reshapes the angular distribution of the intrinsic emissivity and modulates its contribution to various observable signatures. Our results demonstrate that anisotropic non-thermal electrons are essential for a physically complete interpretation of black hole image variability.",

Their cosmological evolution is governed by the competition between mass accretion and Hawking evaporation. In this paper we look into the details impact of accretion. Most of the earlier analysis relied on non-relativistic accretion models. In this work, we reinvestigate this in a fully relativistic framework for Kerr PBHs in the radiation-dominated era. We derive relativistic accretion rate and compute spin-dependent efficiency $\\lambda_{\\text{Kerr}}(a_*)$. Using this result, we construct coupled evolution equations for the PBH mass and spin that include both relativistic accretion and spin-dependent evaporation. Our analysis shows that relativistic accretion significantly increases PBH masses and consequently suppresses their spins, causing all PBHs to become effectively Schwarzschild well before evaporation. These effects strengthen the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound on the initial PBH mass by a factor of $\\sim 4$--$5$, reduce the mass required for survival to the present epoch to $\\sim 2.7\\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{g}$, and shift the viable particle like DM parameter space. Notably the early accretion induced spin-down effect further washes out the well known high-frequency, spin-induced feature in the high frequency stochastic gravitational-wave background, modifying predictions for future detectors.",

Kluźniak 7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) It has been suggested that spinning wormholes may mimic Kerr black holes in astronomical sources such as X-ray binaries and supermassive compact objects in centers of galaxies. With recent advances in instrumentation this could be tested if clear differences between wormhole and black hole accretion were identified. We aim to quantitatively determine the extent to which the orbital properties of test particles in the gravity of a spinning wormhole may differ from those of a Kerr black hole. We seek to find an observable related to disk accretion that would be clearly different for Kerr black holes and Kerr-like wormholes. We use the standard Lagrangian approach to derive the orbital properties of test particles from an effective potential. We use standard thin disk theory to infer the disk surface temperature. We find that at a given circumferential radius the physical quantities relating to circular orbits in the equatorial plane are exactly the same for the spinning wormhole and a black hole of the same mass and angular momentum, if only the two space-time metrics differ in the g_rr component alone. However, for a wormhole there are no orbits of radius less than that of its throat. Non-circular orbits, bound or unbound, are affected by the radial distance function; in particular, the angle of apsidal precession in Kerr-like wormholes will differ from that in Kerr black holes. A Kerr-like wormhole is a perfect black hole mimicker in relation to the orbital properties in the equatorial plane. The angular velocity, specific energy, specific angular momentum, and Lense-Thirring precession rate are the same for a Kerr black hole and a Kerr-like wormhole in circular orbits of the same circumference. We find that the area of the (geometrically thin) accretion disk is different, and this yields a visibly suppressed disk temperature for traversable wormholes with a sufficiently wide throat.",

In this model, a WD orbiting the central massive black hole (MBH) is scattered by an sBH during the sBH's early extreme mass-ratio inspiral phase. We conservatively estimate these events occur a few times per year within $z\\leq 3$. Significant disruption of the WD occurs when the impact parameter is comparable to the WD's radius. We derive a mathematical criterion and confirm numerically by hydrodynamical simulations. With the increase of the impact parameter and the collision speed, the WD material captured by the sBH decreases while the material remain self-gravitating increases. A part of the WD material becomes unbound from the sBH-WD system, and its mass ranges from nearly zero to $\\ge 50\\%$, reaching the peak value when the impact parameter is comparable to the WD's radius. We expect the subsequent capture of WD material by the sBH to produce a prompt X-ray burst (a micro-TDE), and the accretion of unbound debris onto the MBH can power a fainter, delayed optical flare. The properties of certain transient X-ray bursts observed by Einstein Probe are consistent with this micro-TDE picture.",

In this work, we develop a new formalism to account for these perturbations and track the evolution of the binary orbital parameters distribution. Based on this approach, we calculate the merger rate of PBH binaries and demonstrate that its temporal evolution differs greatly from that of isolated binary systems. Moreover, PBH clustering produces distinctive features in the stochastic gravitational-wave background: the canonical $2/3$ spectral slope transforms to $\\Omega_{\\rm gw} \\propto \\nu^{-65/28}$ in a certain frequency band. These predictions can be probed in future gravitational wave observations, opening up new opportunities to test the clustering of PBHs and their contribution to dark matter.",

Unlike the standard cross-correlation search for excess correlated power, a Bayesian search method that models the background as a superposition of an unknown number of mergers enables simultaneous inference of the properties of high-redshift binary black hole populations and accelerated detection of the background. In this work, we apply this templated background search method to one day of simulated data at current LIGO Hanford-Livingston detector network sensitivity to determine whether the weakest mergers contribute information to the detection of the background and to the constraint on the merger redshift distribution at high redshifts. We find that the dominant source of information for the detection of the stochastic background comes from mergers with signal-to-noise ratios just below the individual detection threshold. However, we demonstrate that the weakest mergers do contribute to the constraint on the shape of the redshift distribution not only beyond the peak of star formation, but also beyond the redshifts accessible with individually detectable sources.",

Version accepted for publication in Phys. Lett. B Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Cosmic microwave background data from the {\\it Planck} satellite, combined with baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and Type Ia supernovae from various samples, provide hints of dynamical dark energy (DE). These results indicate a peak in the DE density around $z\\sim 0.4-0.5$, with the highest significance observed when using the supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey. In this {\\it Letter}, we show that this peak does not necessarily imply a true crossing of the phantom divide if the measured effective DE is not a single component, but a combination of standard and negative quintessence. The latter is characterized by negative energy density and positive pressure, both decreasing in absolute value and tending to 0 in the future. For appropriate values of the parameters, negative quintessence is relevant at intermediate redshifts and becomes subdominant in front of standard quintessence around $z\\sim 0.4-0.5$, giving rise to the aforementioned peak in the DE density. We find that our model is preferred over $\\Lambda$CDM at a $3.26\\sigma$ CL, which is comparable to the level of exclusion found with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization. Our analysis leaves open the possibility of negative quintessence and other exotic fields existing in the low-energy universe, potentially playing a significant role in cosmic dynamics.",

To address these issues, we propose a general disformal coupling between dark energy (DE) and dark matter from a field-theoretic action which can generate a rich variety of interactions including conformal and pure-momentum coupling scenarios. Our analysis reveals that a pure disformal coupling naturally produces a unique interacting Early Dark Sector, wherein the interactions with dark matter suppress the Hubble friction on the DE scalar field leading to a kinetic-driven cosmological constant-like behavior at early times followed by its dilution as $a^{-6}$ and eventually leading to a potential-driven epoch characteristic of late-time dark energy. In contrast to existing Early Dark Energy (EDE) models that rely on finely-tuned potentials, the EDE-like behavior, in our framework, is purely a consequence of the disformal coupling paired with the dilution of dark matter, offering a more fundamental and less ad hoc solution to cosmological tensions. This framework also predicts a suppression of power in the CMB temperature spectrum on large angular scales, offering a potential physical explanation for the observed low-$\\ell$ anomaly. By deriving these effects from a fundamental action, our work provides a unified, testable alternative to $\\Lambda$CDM that can be constrained by next-generation cosmological surveys and gravitational wave observations.",

Our machine learning framework generates uncertainty estimates for target variables and the inferred unknown parameters of the underlying PDE descriptions. Built upon a hybrid of the principles of Evidential Deep Learning, Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Bayesian Neural Networks and Gaussian Processes, our model enables learning of the posterior distribution of the unknown PDE parameters through standard gradient-descent based training. We apply our model to an up-to-date BAO dataset (Bousis et al. 2024) calibrated with the CMB-inferred sound horizon, and the Pantheon$+$ Sne Ia distances (Scolnic et al. 2018), examining the relative effectiveness and mutual consistency among the standard $\\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM and $\\Lambda_s$CDM models. Unlike previous results arising from the standard approach of minimizing an appropriate $\\chi^2$ function, the posterior distributions for parameters in various models trained purely on Pantheon$+$ data were found to be largely contained within the $2\\sigma$ contours of their counterparts trained on BAO data. Their posterior medians for $h_0$ were within about $2\\sigma$ of one another, indicating that our machine learning-guided approach provides a different measure of the Hubble tension.",

Recent researches have actively explored how the equation of state (EoS) can be constrained by observed neutron star masses and radii, and how nuclear interactions affect their macroscopic properties. Most of these studies, however, rely on the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, which assumed static, spherically symmetric neutron stars. Since neutron stars are rotating objects and thus axisymmetrically deformed, the TOV calculation may be insufficient to capture their realistic structure. In this work, we investigate the influence of nuclear matter properties on the physical quantities of rotating neutron stars using two approaches: the perturbative Hartle-Thorne (HT) method and fully general relativistic Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu (KEH) method. For nuclear EoS parameter sets, we emamine the OMEG series, in which the slope of the symmetry energy $L$ is systematically varied. We find that rotational effects lead to a noticeable increase in the stellar radius, which depends sensitively on values of $L$. Additionally, focusing on the rotational deformation, we show that the results obtained by these two methods deviate each other even for the slowly rotating case such as $\\Omega=200$ Hz. These results reveal that, for detailed discussions on the internal structure and stability of rotating neutron stars, the fully general relativistic method such as KEH is indispensable.",

However it is possible such forces act on dark matter, as it is less constrained observationally. In this work, we consider dark matter to be made of light bosons, such as axions. We introduce a mediator that communicates a new force between dark matter particles, in addition to gravity. The mediator is taken to be light, but not massless, so that it can affect small scale galactic behavior, but not current cosmological behavior. As a concrete application of this idea, we analyze the effects on scalar dark matter solitons bound by gravitation, i.e., boson stars, which have been claimed to potentially provide cores of galaxies. We numerically determine the soliton's profiles in the presence of this new force. We also extend the analysis to multiple mediators. We show that this new force alters the relation between core density and core radius in a way that can provide improvement in fitting data to observed galactic cores, but for couplings of order the gravitational strength, the improvement is only modest.",

The brane tension gives a residual geometric contribution to the vacuum energy, while the phonon sector is described by three scalar fields $\\phi^I$ and an invariant $b = \\sqrt{\\det B_{IJ}}$ entering an effective action $F(b)$. At the background level this reproduces a perfect fluid with energy density, pressure and bulk modulus set by two dimensionless parameters $\\varepsilon$ and $\\kappa$. These parameters fix the enthalpy and bulk modulus in units of the space tension and determine the phonon sound speed through $c_s^2 = \\kappa/\\varepsilon$. Dissipative effects are modeled by a bulk viscous pressure obeying a Maxwell type relaxation law with a characteristic time scale $\\tau(H)$ that depends on the Hubble rate. Motivated by a Boltzmann suppressed scattering rate at a mass-gap scale $H_\\star$, we adopt a simple ansatz for $H\\tau(H)$ and obtain a compact expression for the effective dark energy equation of state $w_{\\rm eff}(H)$. The viscous correction is transient, is most active around $H \\sim H_\\star$ and drives a temporary phantom deviation. At the same time, we also show that $w_{\\rm eff}$ approaches $-1 + \\varepsilon$ at very early and very late times. Using a flat $\\Lambda$CDM background for $H(z)$, we scan the parameter space and identify a region with $\\kappa \\ \\simeq \\ \\varepsilon \\ \\simeq \\ 1/3$ and $H_\\star/H_0 \\ \\simeq \\ 2.1$. This choice gives an ultralight phonon with sound speed close to the causal limit and a viscous dark energy history $w_{\\rm eff}(z)$ that closely tracks a DESI motivated Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization over the redshift range most relevant for the DESI BAO measurements.",

Based on the t-SNE output, we apply Agglomerative Clustering in combination with the Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of groups. We then track these groups over time and investigate correlations between their occurrence and environmental or instrumental conditions. At the Livingston observatory, the most common glitches during O4a were seasonal and associated with ground motion, whereas at Hanford, the most prevalent glitches were related to instrumental conditions.",

Comments welcome! Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Line Intensity Mapping (LIM) has garnered attention as a powerful cosmological probe, with next-generation instruments such as SPHEREx preparing to map the evolution of large-scale structure during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Lyman-alpha emission in the EoR is strongly shaped by resonant absorption from neutral hydrogen in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM), which transforms galactic sources into a low surface-brightness background. In this work, we leverage the state-of-the-art THESAN cosmological simulations to produce high-resolution theoretical predictions for future Lyman-alpha LIM studies, constructing continuous light cones for line-of-sight cosmological integrations. We assess the contributions of recombination, collisional excitation, and unresolved HII regions to the total Lyman-alpha spectral intensity. In addition, we explore the IGM in absorption at different redshifts using damping wing analysis. We produce channel maps exploring spatial fluctuations across redshift bands probe-able by LIM instruments. We find that the slope of the absorption-included Lyman-alpha fluctuation power spectrum at smaller scales (k > 10^(-2) 1/arcsec) steepens toward lower redshift, and that our emission-only Lyman-alpha power spectrum lies above the SPHEREx sensitivity, whereas the absorption-included signal is ~4 orders of magnitude lower--providing a conservative lower limit on inhomogeneity signatures and highlighting the importance of including resonant scattering in our model in the future. We also find that including outflows in a simple toy model boosts power by four orders of magnitude. We identify limitations in our analysis and propose next steps, including incorporating the effects of resonant Lyman-alpha scattering and line interlopers, as well as larger simulation volumes.",

We generate populations of synthetic black hole (BH) binaries with masses ranging from the intermediate ($10^3-10^5 M_\\odot$) to the supermassive regime ($>10^5 M_\\odot$), formed from the dynamical processes of merging halos and their residing galaxies, assuming that each galaxy is initially seeded with a single black hole at its centre. The aim is to estimate the rate of these BH mergers which could be detected by LISA and LGWA. Using PINOCCHIO cosmological simulation and a semi-analytical model based on GAEA, we construct a population of merging BHs by implementing a \"light\" seeding scheme and calculating the merging timescales using the Chandrasekhar prescription. We provide upper and lower limits of dynamical friction timescale by varying the mass of the infalling object to create \"pessimistic\" and \"optimistic\" merger rates respectively. We find that for our synthetic population of MBHs, both LGWA and LISA are able to detect more than $15$ binary IMBH mergers per year in the optimistic case, while in the pessimistic case less than $\\sim5$ detections would be possible considering the entire lifetime of the detectors. For SMBHs, the rates are slightly lower in both cases. Most mergers below $z\\approx4$ are detected in the optimistic case, although mergers beyond $z=8$ are also detectable at a lower rate. We find that LGWA is better suited for high-SNR IMBH detections at higher redshift, while LISA is more sensitive to massive SMBHs. Joint observations will probe the full BH mass spectrum and constrain BH formation and seeding models.",

We aim to investigate scaling relations between observable cluster properties and mass, and to study the radial X-ray profiles of a large sample of optically selected clusters. We analyze a sample of 997 CAMIRA clusters with richness $N > 15$ and redshifts of $0.1 < z < 1.3$. Using bolometric luminosities derived from count rates and a weak-lensing mass calibration, we study the $L-M$ and $N-M$ scaling relations through stacking analysis, while accounting for selection effects and redshift evolution. We also compare clusters with and without X-ray counterparts in the eFEDS catalog in terms of their scaling relations and surface brightness profiles. The best-fit $L-M$ slope ($1.56^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$) is slightly steeper than the self-similar prediction, yet remains consistent with our previous findings. The $N-M$ slope ($0.766^{+0.070}_{-0.060}$) broadly agrees with theoretical expectations and other optical samples. The data do not require any additional redshift evolution beyond the standard self-similar scaling, although current constraints on evolution remain weak. X-ray detected clusters exhibit a steeper $L-M$ slope, higher central surface brightness, and more centrally concentrated X-ray profiles than undetected systems. Our results highlight systematic differences in the X-ray properties between optically and X-ray selected cluster samples. This study extends scaling relation analyses into lower mass and luminosity regimes, demonstrating the value of combining deep X-ray and optical surveys like eROSITA and Subaru HSC.",

Malz, Michelle Lochner, The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to discover nearly a million Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa), offering an unprecedented opportunity to constrain dark energy. The vast majority of these events will lack spectroscopic classification and redshifts, necessitating a fully photometric approach to maximize cosmology constraining power. We present detailed simulations based on the Extended LSST Astronomical Time Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC), and a cosmological analysis using photometrically classified SNeIa with host galaxy photometric redshifts. This dataset features realistic multi-band light curves, non-SNIa contamination, host mis-associations, and transient-host correlations across the high-redshift Deep Drilling Fields (DDF) (~ 50 deg^2). We also include a spectroscopically confirmed low-redshift sample based on the Wide Fast Deep (WFD) fields. We employ a joint SN+host photometric redshift fit, a neural network based photometric classifier (SCONE), and BEAMS with Bias Corrections (BBC) methodology to construct a bias-corrected Hubble diagram. We produce statistical + systematic covariance matrices, and perform cosmology fitting with a prior using Cosmic Microwave Background constraints. We fit and present results for the wCDM dark energy model, and the more general Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) w0wa model. With a simulated sample of ~6000 events, we achieve a Figure of Merit (FoM) value of about 150, which is significantly larger than the DESVYR FoM of 54.

Feder, Martin White 8 pages, 7 figures, to be submitted to MNRAS Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Ongoing and near-future spectroscopic surveys, such as DESI, DESI-II and Spec-S5, rely on imaging-based selections to construct uniform, three-dimensional tracers of large-scale structure. While spectroscopic data from these surveys constrain the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature with high precision, the imaging surveys used for target selection can provide useful information on the angular diameter distance $D_A(z)$. In this work we explore the feasibility of angular BAO measurements for the Intermediate-Band Imaging Survey (IBIS) using recent constraints on clustering from a pilot survey spanning $2.2<z<3.5$. Through Fisher forecasts, we find that a 5000 deg$^2$ survey of LAEs with realistic bias, a tracer density of $2\\times 10^{-4}$ (h/Mpc)$^3$ and interloper fraction $f_{\\rm int}=10\\%$ can constrain the BAO dilation parameter $\\alpha$ at $z_{\\rm eff}=2.8$ with a precision of 2.6\\%, with dependence on the sample properties that is consistent with shot noise-dominated measurements. We then explore medium-band survey specifications for the planned Stage-V Spectroscopic Instrument (Spec-S5) and beyond, demonstrating the potential for precise high-redshift BAO measurements.

Specifically, we propose measuring the two-point cross-correlation between RM squared, ${\\rm RM}^2$, towards background sources and the projected density field of foreground galaxies, $\\langle {\\rm RM}^2 \\times {\\rm g} \\rangle$, as a function of transverse separation. This statistic is analogous to the ''projected fields'' estimator used for the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect, $\\langle {\\rm kSZ}^2 \\times {\\rm g} \\rangle$. Our estimator avoids contamination, and is also free from the noise bias that arises when correlating the absolute value of the RMs with galaxies. Moreover, by binning in foreground galaxy redshifts, $\\langle {\\rm RM}^2 \\times {\\rm g} \\rangle$ enables a tomographic reconstruction of the redshift evolution of large-scale cosmic magnetic fields. We model this statistic using the Illustris-TNG cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulations and compare with approximate analytic predictions. We show that $\\langle {\\rm RM}^2 \\times {\\rm g} \\rangle$ can be related to a bispectrum involving two copies of the electron-density--weighted magnetic field strength and one of the galaxy overdensity. In Illustris-TNG, the effective field strength is primarily set by the magnetic field amplitudes within the inner regions of galaxy-hosting dark matter halos. It increases towards low redshift, driven by dynamo amplification and magnetized outflows. Our forecasts suggest that $\\langle {\\rm RM}^2 \\times {\\rm g} \\rangle$ is detectable at high significance with current galaxy surveys and future RM catalogs from the SKA, offering a tomographic probe of large-scale magnetic fields across cosmic time.",

The supersymmetry-based WZDR framework has demonstrated considerable potential in alleviating the Hubble tension. Previous investigations have examined the interaction between stepped dark radiation and cold dark matter, with the aim of simultaneously addressing both the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions. Given the suppressive effect of scalar field dark matter on small-scale structure growth, we replace cold dark matter with scalar field dark matter in the present work and introduce its interaction with stepped dark radiation via pure momentum coupling, thereby formulating a novel coupling model. We impose constraints on the model parameters using a variety of cosmological datasets, including the Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Type Ia Supernovae, $H_0$ measurements from SH0ES, $S_8$ data from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3, and data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. Our analysis reveals that the performance of the new model is nearly identical to that of the original WZDR model, with only a marginal improvement. When using the full data combination, the best-fit values for $H_0$ in the coupled model and WZDR model are 70.89 km/s/Mpc and 70.68 km/s/Mpc, respectively. For the $S_8$ parameter, the new model results in a decrease from 0.8136 in the original model to 0.8113. Furthermore, the coupling signal remains weak, with the constraint on the coupling parameter being $\\log_{10}(\\xi)<4.56$. While the coupling model offers some improvement, it does not fully resolve the cosmological tensions, indicating that further investigation is required to address these issues.",

Comments are welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We investigate the imprints of memory-burdened primordial black holes (PBH) on the global 21 cm signal during the cosmic dawn. Recent studies reopened the possibility of a mass window of PBHs as a compelling candidate for dark matter, particularly in low-mass regimes ($M_{\\text {PBH}}< 10^{15}$ g) where conventional constraints from evaporation are being revisited in light of quantum gravitational effects. One such effect, the \\textit{memory burden effect}, slows down black hole evaporation by incorporating the backreaction of radiation on the black hole microstates, substantially extending the lifetime of light PBHs and thus modifying their late-time emission spectra. This prolonged emission can dramatically alter the energy injection history in the early universe. By computing the modified energy injection rates into the intergalactic medium and incorporating them into the thermal and ionization evolution of neutral hydrogen, we obtain projected constraints on the fraction of dark matter. The bounds are obtained from the fact that these low mass PBHs, which were thought otherwise evaporated, can modify the absorption amplitude in the global 21 cm signal at redshift $z\\approx17$. Considering the two viable scenarios of transition to the memory-burden phase: fast (or instantaneous) and slow (transition with a finite width), we show how the 21 cm bounds are sensitive to different mass ranges.

Comments are welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We study the impact of self-interactions on the structure and evolution of scalar field dark matter (SFDM) halos. Using three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson simulations of multiple soliton mergers, we explore both repulsive and attractive regimes across a wide range of scattering lengths. Our results show that repulsive self-interactions lead to more massive and extended cores with lower central densities compared to the free (non-interacting) fuzzy dark matter case, while attractive interactions enhance central densities and can drive cores toward collapse, once a critical mass is exceeded. We confirm that the mass-radius relation of solitonic cores is well described by analytical predictions, even in the presence of self-interactions, and we extend the core-halo mass relation to scenarios beyond fuzzy dark matter. We find that the scaling relations between core mass, size, and total energy are not universal but depend sensitively on the strength and sign of the self-interaction, as well as on the evolutionary stage of the halo. These results demonstrate that self-interactions provide a natural mechanism to regulate core properties, with important implications for the formation of supermassive black holes and for potential astrophysical signatures in galactic cores.",

Firouzjaee Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We investigate the late-time imprints of three dark energy (DE) models, namely, the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, $\\Lambda_{\\rm s}$CDM, and an Omnipotent DE model, on cosmological observables sensitive to the time evolution of gravitational potentials. While CPL serves as a reference parameterization, the Omnipotent and $\\Lambda_{\\rm s}$CDM scenarios were originally proposed as possible solutions to the $H_0$ tension and are selected here because they can yield negative dark energy. These models are examined within a multi-probe framework based on the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect and the lensing-ISW bispectrum. By analyzing both two- and three-point Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) correlations, we assess how their late-time dynamics modify the growth and decay of large-scale gravitational potentials compared to the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Despite producing nearly indistinguishable CMB angular spectra at high multipoles, these models yield distinctive signatures in the low-$\\ell$ ISW plateau as well as in higher-order statistics related to ISW, highlighting the power of both large-scale CMB anisotropies and higher-order CMB statistics in testing dark energy physics. Our results demonstrate that combining complementary ISW probes provides an effective way to discriminate between dark energy scenarios and will be crucial to determine whether negative or sign-switching dark energy is ultimately favored or disfavored by forthcoming data.",

While traditional two-point statistics capture only the Gaussian features of the convergence field, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise in extracting non-Gaussian information from small-scale, nonlinear structures. In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of attention-based architectures, including variants of vision transformers (ViTs) and shifted window (Swin) transformers, in constraining the cosmological parameters $\\Omega_m$ and $S_8$ from weak lensing mass maps. Using a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework, we compare transformer-based methods to CNNs. We also examine performance scaling with the number of available $N$-body simulations, highlighting the importance of pre-training for transformer architectures. We find that the Swin transformer performs significantly better than vanilla ViTs, especially with limited training data. Despite their higher representational capacity, the Figure of Merit for cosmology achieved by transformers is comparable to that of CNNs under realistic noise conditions.",

Abdalla Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The inflationary $B$-mode signals encode invaluable information about the origin of our Universe and searching for potential signatures of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) is one of the major science goals for future precision observations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization. However, dominant $B$-mode signals of both Galactic foreground contamination and gravitational lensing effects prevent direct measurements of the PGW $B$-mode signals. There are existing proposals which can effectively eliminate these two contaminants but issues remain for future high-sensitivity and multifrequency CMB polarization observations, such as spatially-varying spectral energy distribution (SED) of polarized foreground and cosmological $B$-mode signals due to primordial magnetic fields (PMFs). In this work, we investigate inference of PGW $B$-mode signals in the presence of both complexities. We employ a constrained moment internal linear combination (cMILC) method to remove polarization signals arising from spatially varying SEDs. Also, we employ a power-spectrum-based approach to extracting both the Galactic and cosmological $B$-mode components. Two methods have been validated by mock data and different consistency tests have been performed. We apply these two methods to end-to-end simulations for future high-sensitivity and multifrequency polarization observations and investigate the detectability of different $B$-mode signals in the presence of non-Gaussian polarized foregrounds under different scenarios. This study will be important for new physics studies with $B$-mode signatures.",

We utilize Betti curves, a summary statistic derived from persistent homology, to characterize the multiscale topological features of the LSS, including connected components, loops, and voids, as a complementary cosmological probe. Using halo catalogs from the \\textsc{Quijote} suite, we construct Betti curves, assess their sensitivity to cosmological parameters, and train automated machine learning based emulators to model their dependence on cosmological parameters. Our Bayesian inference recovers unbiased estimation of cosmological parameters, notably $n_{\\mathrm{s}}$, $\\sigma_8$, and $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{m}}$, while validation on sub-box simulations confirms robustness against cosmic variance. We further investigate the impact of redshift-space distortions (RSD) on Betti curves and demonstrate that including RSD enhances sensitivity to growth-related parameters. By jointly analyzing Betti curves and the power spectrum, we achieve significantly tightened constraints than using power spectrum alone on parameters such as $n_{\\mathrm{s}}$, $\\sigma_8$, and $w$.

First, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) inferred from the combined data consistently aligns with early-universe measurements across all models, indicating a persistent Hubble tension. Second, we find compelling evidence for dynamical dark energy: early-universe (CMB) constraints favor a phantom phase (with an equation-of-state parameter $w < -1$), while late-universe (BAO/SNIa) data prefer quintessence ($w > -1$).

The generally non-trivial linear solution is computed by solving a Volterra-type integral equation and higher orders are obtained recursively. As expected, the results of Eulerian standard perturbation theory are recovered for perfectly cold initial conditions. Deviating slightly from the latter by introducing a homogeneous and isotropic initial velocity dispersion, we show that all higher momentum cumulants are generated dynamically at any perturbative order.

Perlmutter, B. Popovic, J.N. Purdum, B. Rusholme, J. Sollerman, J.H. Terwel, A. Townsend Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) This paper has two aims: the first one is to build a large homogeneous spectrophotometric Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) sample, using 3069 spectra from the second Zwicky Transient Facility data release (ZTF DR2). Using this sample we reproduce, as the second objective of the paper, the Twins Embedding (TE) spectrophotometric standardisation method, which led to an exceptionally low value of 0.073 mag for the intrinsic scatter. We improve the flux-calibration accuracy of the SEDm SN Ia spectral sample using the ZTF photometric data, which are calibrated at the percent level. We then apply the three steps of the TE parameterisation to a subset of 783 ZTF SN spectra near maximum light, and analyse the resulting standardisation methods. The precision of the phase correction model, which is the first step of the TE, is estimated at 0.01 mag in g band, using ZTF data. Despite the challenge posed by the ZTF spectrum extraction pipeline, we apply a first standardisation in color based on the second step of the TE, the Read Between The Lines (RBTL). When considering the scatter due to the redshift error and the flux calibration error, we estimate a 0.129 mag Hubble residual scatter for this ZTF sample as an upper limit. As expected from the low spectral quality, the final TE standardisation based on three non-linear parameters did not improve the overall dispersion. We release 1897 flux calibrated spectra of 1607 SNe Ia with an estimated photometric accuracy of 0.07 mag. We further demonstrate the ability to apply a spectrophotometric standardisation with limited quality spectra. The RBTL standardisation is more efficient than that of SALT with one less parameter, and the resulting host steps are consistent with zero, making it less prone to astrophysical bias. For future spectroscopic surveys, a better spectral quality would enable the full TE standardisation to be computed. (Abridged)",

This is Paper V of the DESI Strong Lens Foundry series. These systems were discovered in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys using ML/AI methods and confirmed with DESI, Keck/NIRES, and VLT/MUSE spectroscopy. They span $z_d = 0.39 - 1.1$ and $z_s = 1.4 - 3.3$. This is the first HST strong lens sample modeled with full forward modeling -- all lens and source parameters sampled simultaneously in a single inference -- with explicit convergence validation using both $\\widehat{R}$ and effective sample size (ESS) for each system. All inferred parameters satisfy $\\widehat{R} < 1.1$ and ${\\rm ESS} \\gtrsim 10,000$, demonstrating that GIGA-Lens achieves statistically robust inference even for some of the most complex galaxy-scale lenses known. These results pave the way for scaling to much larger, high-resolution strong lens samples from HST, Euclid, JWST, and Roman.

Comments and suggestions welcome. Please see the short video in: this https URL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Identifying the sources of high-energy (TeV-PeV) astrophysical neutrinos is crucial for studies in both astrophysics and particle physics. Despite extensive searches for more than a decade, which revealed several individual potential sources and only one potential source class, the origins of these neutrinos remain largely unresolved; thus, more source classes should be investigated. In this work, we conduct the first search for high-energy neutrino emission from a new source class, supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), which are also theoretically motivated. We perform an unbinned maximum-likelihood-ratio analysis on our constructed catalog of 693 SMBHB candidates and 10 years of IceCube public data. Our results show positive correlations, with higher significance in more physically motivated scenarios and the highest significance at 3.0$\\sigma$. In addition, we also study potential connections between SMBHBs' high-energy neutrino and nano-Hz gravitational-wave emissions, the latter being the main target of pulsar timing arrays. Our results provide the first evidence of SMBHBs being high-energy neutrino emitters.",

Alawabdeh Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Thallium-doped sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)) scintillation detectors play an important role in the field of direct dark matter (DM) searches. The DAMA/LIBRA experiment stands out for its reported observation of an annually modulating DM-like signal, which is in direct contrast with other results. To accurately calibrate the energies of nuclear recoil signals with electron recoils, precise measurements of the quenching factor of the NaI(Tl) crystals are essential, as the two processes have different scintillation light yield. In this article, we present results of a systematic study carried out by the COSINUS collaboration and Duke University to measure the quenching factor of sodium (Na) recoils as a function of nuclear recoil energy and for differing Thallium (Tl) dopant concentrations in the bulk crystal. Five ultrapure NaI(Tl) crystals, manufactured by the Shanghai Institute for Ceramics, were irradiated with a quasi-monoenergetic neutron beam at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory, North Carolina, USA. The quenching factor for low nuclear recoil energies of 5-26keV$_{nr}$ was extracted for all 5 crystals. A Tl-dependence could be deduced with a proportional response calibration schema using a $^{241}$Am source. However, this effect was not observed when using a low-energy calibration line from $^{133}$Ba.",

Quasar absorption lines - the imprints left by intervening gas on the light from distant quasars - provide key diagnostics of many aspects of this investigation, ranging from fundamental physics to cosmology and galaxy formation. The unprecedented combination of extremely precise wavelength calibration, high spectral resolution and high sensitivity of the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO) has finally enabled observations that will further constrain both state-of-the-art cosmological simulations of galaxy evolution and theoretical stellar nucleosynthetic yields. In this article, we present the ESPRESSO Quasar Absorption Line Survey (EQUALS), an ESO Large Programme, designed to tackle several outstanding questions from constraining the properties of dark matter at the smallest scales probed by the Lyman-alpha forest to determining the temperature of the intergalactic medium at z ~ 4 and precisely quantifying the chemical contributions of stellar populations in the early Universe. EQUALS will provide a legacy sample of deep spectra to showcase ESPRESSO capabilities to the quasar absorption line community whilst providing epoch measurements for the key science goals of upcoming spectroscopic instrumentation on the next generations of telescopes.",

Fargion High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Recently the ARCA array detector published the down-ward-horizontal event: the KM3-230213A. It appeared as the most energetic neutrino ever observed: about 200 PeV (2 10^17 eV) up to EeV (10^18 eV) energy. This huge value, is puzzling. It is not statistically consistent with several upper bound derived by two greater and longer life detectors: by IceCube and in particular by AUGER array. Asymmetry in recent IceCube neutrino alert tracks upward and downward at same horizontal angles as ARCA one, suggest that they are mostly polluted atmospheric muon bundles. This paucity also disfavor the skimming neutrino interpretation by ARCA. We suggest that the array floating and bending in the deep sea may lead, sometime, to a misleading geometry that is pointing to a wrong arrival angle direction: a much less horizontal muon (neutrino) track respect to a much real one, more inclined and vertical, due to atmospheric muon bundle or charmed single event. Contrary to present argument, if such a rare event would be soon rediscovered in data or re-observed, it would open the road to a new guaranteed Tau neutrino Astronomy. At EeV energy such upward tau air-showers should shine AUGER telescopes or blaze future satellite in Space. A previous model in astrophysics considered energetic neutrino E>>100 EeV, neutrino scattering, onto cosmic, relic, light mass ones. Their ultra-relativistic Z boson resonance formation and its decay in flight would produce hadron UHECR relics around tens-hundred EeV energy.

Plus 140, 1175 (2025) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The distinction between weak and strong lensing is somewhat arbitrary, and both regimes are manifestations of the same physical phenomenon: gravity bending the path of light. Nevertheless, these two regimes have to a large extent been treated separately, since they require different approaches. This review traces the development of methods combining weak-lensing and strong-lensing data for joint lens-mass reconstruction, with a particular emphasis on cluster lenses, where both effects occur. We conclude that so-called inverse methods have been successful in merging the two regimes insofar data analysis is concerned. However, a number of improvements seem to be in place. First, not many studies include weak lensing data beyond shear. In light of the unprecedented quality of the data of JWST and future surveys, this is a clear point of improvement. Especially so since flexion terms have proven useful in determining sub-structures. Second, considering the amount of data available, and the complexity of non-parametric lenses, automating the processes of lens-mass reconstruction would be beneficial. Towards this end, invoking machine learning seems like a promising way forward.",

Domain walls can significantly contribute to the energy density in the late-evolution stage. We propose that the density perturbations from the fluctuations in the number density of the domain walls could collapse to form primordial black holes. This mechanism becomes effective when the domain wall energy density ratio to that of the radiation reaches about 0.1 in the radiation-dominated Universe. We find that models with $Z_2$ symmetry are excluded for interpreting pulsar timing array observations on the nano-Hz gravitational wave background since this model's domain wall number density fluctuations could lead to an overabundance of the primordial black holes. Moreover, the models, which generate approximately $N\\sim 10$ domain walls from the spontaneous breaking of a discrete $Z_N$ symmetry, are also subject to stringent constraints due to the overproduction of primordial black holes.",

The granular structure of ultralight dark matter density fields produces metric perturbations which have been identified as a potentially interesting probe of this model. For dark matter masses $m \\gtrsim 10^{-17} \\, \\mathrm{eV}$, these perturbations would fluctuate on timescales comparable to observational timescales. In this paper, we estimate the expected time delay these fluctuations would generate in simulated pulsar signals. We simulate arrays of mock pulsars in a fluctuating granular density field. We calculate the expected Shapiro time delay, gravitational redshift, and Doppler shift and compare analytical estimates with the results of simulations.

We introduce a window function to account for the relevant perturbation scales associated with PBHs of different masses, along with a filter function that removes unphysical contributions from super-horizon-scale overdensities.

Minor changes: nT-r plot is added (Fig. 4), appendix B is added. Main results remain same. Version accepted for Phys. Rev. D Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We investigate the complementary information to be gained from inflationary gravitational wave (IGW) signals and searches for QCD axion dark matter. We focus on post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn (PQ) breaking axion models that are cosmologically safe. Recent work has shown that a greater number of such models exist. This is because the heavy quarks required for the colour anomaly can provoke a period of heavy quark domination (HQD), which, through decay, dilutes the axion abundance. In this work we show for the first time that the axion dark matter mass can be as low as $m_a\\sim10^{-8}\\,{\\rm eV}$ for models where the heavy quarks decay via dimension 6 terms. This is achieved by allowing the mass of the heavy quarks to differ from the axion decay constant, $m_Q\\neq f_a$. Consequently, the observables that would distinguish between pre- and post-inflationary PQ breaking, $m_a$ and the additional relativistic degrees of freedom $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$, now become indiscernible. To solve this, we propose using blue-tilted IGWs to probe HQD. In scenarios where such a blue tilt is present, the enhanced GW signal allows future interferometers to place non-trivial constraints on the parameters $m_Q$ and $f_a$, thereby complementing haloscope searches. While some degeneracies with other parameters such as $m_Q$ remain, detectors such as BBO and ET will be able to optimistically probe $f_a\\gtrsim 10^{14}\\,{\\rm GeV}$.",

Simulations predict that cold gas, the fuel for star formation, is channeled through filamentary structures into galaxies. Yet, direct observational evidence for this process has been limited by the challenge of mapping the cosmic web at small scales. Using miniJPAS spectro-photometric data combined with spectroscopic DESI redshifts when available, we construct a high-density observational galaxy sample spanning 0.2<z<0.8. Local filaments are detected within a 3 Mpc physical radius of each galaxy with stellar mass M* >10^(10) Msun using all nearby galaxies as tracers, combined with a probabilistic adaptation of the DisPerSE algorithm designed to overcome limitations due to photometric redshift uncertainties. Our methodology is tested and validated using mock catalogues built with random forest models applied to a simulated lightcone. Besides recovering the expected increase in galaxy connectivity (defined as the number of filaments attached to a galaxy) with stellar mass, we show that our connectivity measurements agree with 3D reference estimates from the mock galaxies. Thanks to these filament reconstructions, we explore the relation between small-scale connectivity and galaxy star formation rate, finding a mild positive trend which needs to be confirmed by follow up studies with larger sample sizes. We propose galaxy connectivity to local filaments as a powerful and physically motivated metric of environment, offering new insights into the role of cosmic structure in galaxy evolution.",

      "abstract": "The role of peculiar velocity uncertainties in standard siren cosmology Chris Blake, Ryan J. Turner 7 pages, 5 figures, Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Local distance indicators such as standard sirens, in combination with spectroscopic redshift measurements of their host galaxies, allow us to estimate the present-day expansion rate of the Universe parameterised by Hubble's constant, H_0. However, these observed redshifts are systematically modified by the effect of galaxy peculiar velocities. Although these velocities may be estimated from the local density field by the process of velocity-field reconstruction, the intrinsic errors and covariance in these estimates contribute to the error in the H_0 determination. In this paper we demonstrate how the impact of peculiar velocities can be propagated into H_0 measurements from local distance indicators with observed redshifts, incorporating the full covariance of the velocity field induced by bulk flows. We apply our methods to cosmological simulations, testing the importance of this effect in the context of future analyses of gravitational wave sources with electromagnetic counterparts used as bright sirens. We conclude that H_0 errors may be increased by a factor of 2 in comparison with neglecting peculiar velocity covariance, for GW170817-like sirens located within 50 Mpc with 5% distance errors, with the highest impacts expected for sources at nearby distances or with small distance errors. Our analytical methods may also be applied to other local distance indicators, such as Type Ia supernovae.",

The main absorption-amplifying effect is the earlier birth of the first stars forming an ultraviolet radiation background. This radiation reduces the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen and, thus, amplifies the absorption in the 21 cm line. A comparison of various cosmological models (with and without a bump in the density perturbation spectrum) shows that it is possible to determine the probable position of the bump in the perturbation spectrum and, thus, to reconstruct the spectrum of cosmological perturbations on scales $k>1$~Mpc${}^{-1}$ from the position of the absorption frequency profile.",

ApJ accepted version Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Secure methods for identifying the host galaxies of individual massive black hole (MBH) binaries and mergers detected by gravitational wave experiments such as LISA and Pulsar Timing Arrays are currently lacking, but will be critical to a variety of science goals. Recently in Bardati et al. (2024, Paper I), we used the Romulus25 cosmological simulation to show that MBH merger host galaxies have unique morphologies in imaging, due to their stronger bulges. Here, we use the same sample of simulated MBH merger host galaxies to investigate their stellar kinematics, as probed by optical integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy. We perform stellar population synthesis and dust radiative transfer to generate synthetic 3D optical spectral datacubes of each simulated galaxy, and produce mock stellar kinematic maps. Based on a linear discriminant analysis of a combination of kinematic parameters derived from these maps, we show that this approach can identify MBH binary and merger host galaxies with accuracies that increase with chirp mass and mass ratio. For mergers with high chirp masses (>10^8.2 Msun) and high mass ratios (>0.5), the accuracies reach >85%, and their host galaxies are uniquely characterized by slower rotation and stronger stellar kinematic misalignments. These kinematic properties are commonly associated with massive early-type galaxies that have experienced major mergers, and naturally act as signposts for MBH binaries and mergers with high chirp masses and mass ratios. These results suggest that IFU spectroscopy should also play a role in telescope follow-up of future MBH binaries and mergers detected in gravitational waves.",

Updated to match version published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) X-ray bright cool-core (CC) clusters contain luminous radio sources accelerating cosmic ray (CR) leptons at prodigious rates. Near the acceleration region, high-energy leptons produce synchrotron (mini)halos and sometimes observable gamma rays, but these leptons have short lifetimes and so cannot propagate far from sources without some rejuvenation. However, low-energy (~0.1-1 GeV) CRs should survive for >Gyr, potentially reaching ~100 kpc before losing energy via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons to keV X-ray energies, with remarkably thermal X-ray spectra. In groups/clusters, this will appear similar to relatively 'cool' gas in cluster cores (i.e. CCs). In lower-mass (e.g. Milky Way/M31) halos, analogous CR IC emission will appear as hot (super-virial) gas at outer CGM radii, explaining recent diffuse X-ray observations. We show that for plausible (radio/gamma-ray observed) lepton injection rates, the CR-IC emission could contribute significantly to the X-ray surface brightness (SB) in CCs, implying that CC gas densities may have been overestimated and alleviating the cooling flow problem. A significant IC contribution to diffuse X-ray emission in CC clusters also explains the tight correlation between the X-ray 'cooling luminosity' and AGN/cavity/jet power, because the apparent CC emission is itself driven by the radio source. Comparing observed Sunyaev Zeldovich to X-ray inferred pressures at $\\ll 100$ kpc in CCs represents a clean test of this scenario, and existing data appears to favor significant CR-IC. A significant IC contribution also implies that X-ray inferred gas-phase metallicities have been underestimated in CCs, potentially explaining the discrepancy between X-ray (sub-Solar) and optical/UV (super-Solar) observed metallicities in the central ~10 kpc of nearby CCs. We also discuss the model's connection to observations of multiphase gas in clusters.",

ApJ accepted version Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present the first infrared spectral predictions from a self-consistent simulation of the formation of a quasar in a starburst galaxy, spanning the cosmological environment to scales well below the dust sublimation region. The infrared (IR) emission is dominated by a torus-like dust structure composed of the highly magnetized, turbulence-supported outer accretion disk and of accreting gas tidally torn from the interstellar medium (ISM). At these early stages, the active galactic nuclei (AGN) is buried and Compton-thick. The near- to mid-IR escaping luminosity varies by almost an order of magnitude across sightlines, largely due to extinction from the inflowing stream of cold dust. Self-absorption within the torus suppresses silicate emission features, and further reprocessing by the ambient ISM leads to prominent silicate absorption and colder IR emission. The sublimation structure is stratified by composition and size, producing sightline-dependent extinction curves that intrinsically vary in shape. However, after repeated scattering in the optically thick dusty medium, these curves emerge substantially grayed. We also demonstrate that bipolar outflows from the central black hole that carve biconical cavities and reveal the central engine in later stages can preserve IR anisotropy and silicate features. These results suggest that dusty starburst quasars can undergo a buried, IR-bright phase early in their evolution.",

We introduce two complementary neighbor-search strategies, a standard k-d tree and a novel linked-cell grid, and demonstrate that jFoF attains up to an order-of-magnitude speedup compared to optimized CPU implementations while maintaining consistent halo catalogs. Beyond performance, jFoF enables gradient propagation through discrete halo-finding operations via both frozen-assignment and topological optimization modes. Using a topological optimization approach via a REINFORCE-style estimator, our approach allows smooth optimization of halo connectivity and membership, bridging continuous simulation fields with discrete structure catalogs. These capabilities make jFoF a foundation for differentiable inference, enabling end-to-end, gradient-based optimization of structure formation models within GPU-accelerated astrophysical pipelines.

We report the first X-ray detections of the dusty WC+O binary system WR 112 from Chandra and Swift, alongside 27 years of VLA/ATCA radio monitoring and new diffraction-limited Keck images. Because we view the nearly circular orbit almost edge-on, the colliding-wind zone alternates between heavy Wolf-Rayet wind self-absorption and a near-transparent O-star wind foreground each 20-yr orbit, producing phase-locked radio and X-ray variability. This scenario leads to a prediction that the radio spectral index is flatter from a larger non-thermal contribution around the radio intensity maximum, which is indeed observed. Existing models that assume a single dust-expansion speed fail to reproduce the combined infrared geometry and radio light curve. Instead, we require an accelerating post-shock flow that climbs from near-stationary to ~1350 km/s in about one orbital cycle, naturally matching the infrared spiral from about 5\" down to within 0.1\", while also fitting the phase of the radio brightening. These kinematic constraints supply critical boundary conditions for future hydrodynamic simulations, which can link hot-plasma cooling, non-thermal radio emission, X-ray spectra, and dust formation in a self-consistent framework. WR 112 thus joins WR 140, WR 104, and WR 70-16 (Apep) as a benchmark system for testing colliding-wind physics under an increasingly diverse range of orbital architectures and physical conditions.",

We investigate UFO signatures by analyzing a broad collection of published detections. Our final sample comprises 122 robust (> 2$\\sigma$) UFO detections in 57 AGN, spanning wide ranges in redshift, luminosity, black hole mass, and Eddington ratio. By combining phenomenological and photoionization modeling of the absorption features, we characterize empirical correlations among UFO properties. We find that line width, equivalent width, and outflow velocity are positively correlated, indicating that the broadest and strongest absorption lines trace the fastest winds, although the $\\upsilon_\\mathrm{out} - \\sigma$ trend is comparatively weak. The large inferred velocity dispersions, often exceeding the uncertainty on the centroid velocity, must be included when estimating wind energetics and scaling relations. From the velocity constraints we derive lower limits on the launching radii, finding a minimum distance consistent with the innermost stable circular orbit of a weakly or non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole. We also assess for the first time how UFO properties depend on AGN class: differences between Seyferts and quasars, bridged by narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, appear to be driven mainly by black hole mass and luminosity. The observed co-variation of velocity, width, and equivalent width supports a picture of clumpy, multi-component winds propagating through a thermally unstable multiphase medium within the chaotic cold accretion (CCA) cycle, and is consistent with both magnetically and line-driven acceleration. High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with missions such as XRISM and NewAthena will be crucial to resolve the structure, kinematics, and physical origin of these flows.",

Luangtip, S. Sanpa-arsa 16 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables, accepted (2025 December 5) by MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration extragalactic transients, observationally classified as repeaters or nonrepeaters. This classification may be biased, as some apparently non-repeating sources could simply have undetected subsequent bursts. To address this, we develop a semi-supervised learning framework to identify distinguishing features of repeaters using primary observational parameters from the Blinkverse database, which draws from the CHIME/FRB Catalogs. The framework combines labeled data (known repeaters and confidently classified non-repeaters) with unlabeled sources previously flagged as non-repeaters but exhibiting repeater-like characteristics. We employ uniform manifold approximation and projection with a nearest-neighbor scheme to select potential candidates, followed by semi-supervised classification using five base estimators, including random forest, support vector machine, logistic regression, AdaBoost, and Gradient boost. Each model is fine-tuned through cross-validation, and a voting strategy among the five models is employed to enhance robustness. All models achieve consistently high performance, identifying dispersion measure, peak frequency, and fluence as the most discriminative features. Repeaters tend to show lower dispersion measures, higher peak frequencies, and higher fluences than non-repeaters. We also identify a set of candidate repeaters, several of which are consistent with prior independent studies. Our approach can identify 36 additional repeater candidates that conventional methods may have missed. Finally, the results highlight dispersion measure as a key discriminator between repeaters and non-repeaters, revealing a tension between physical and instrumental origins-either environmental effects, if the two populations arise from distinct progenitors, or detection bias, as nearby sources are more easily observed.",

The energy loss rate of the magnetar is determined by the strength of the magnetic field at the pole. We investigated the effect of the magnetic inclination angle on the energy loss rate. The released energy is injected into the GRB jet and shapes the light curves of GRB afterglow. Different evolutionary approaches lead to different curves shapes.A shallow decay phase in GRB X-ray afterglow may result from energy injection from a magnetar with a fixed inclination angle. A two-plateau phase may result from a decreasing inclination angle scenario. In this study, we considered an increasing inclination angle scenario. The energy loss rate of the magnetar increases as the magnetic inclination angle grows. Our analysis reveals that as the lost rotational energy injected into the GRB jet increases, rebrightening phases occur in the GRB afterglows. The rebrightening features are slight and short-lived. The observed afterglow rebrightening of GRB 170822A and GRB 230414B can be well explained within our framework. Some GRB X-ray afterglows that exhibit slight and early rebrightenings may result from an increasing magnetic inclination angle of a nascent magnetar.",

We conducted follow-up observations using ULTRACAM on the New Technology Telescope at the La Silla Observatory to search for the optical counterpart to the pulsar companions. We found two redback companions, in PSRs J1803$-$6707 and J1036$-$4353, and provided upper limits for the other pulsar binaries. We used the \\texttt{Icarus} code to fit the redback's light curves using various irradiation models. The asymmetric double-peak light curves of PSR~J1036$-$4353 are best fit with diffusion and convection models. Comparing the two prescriptions of irradiation and gravity darkening, models with post-irradiation gravity darkening provide superior fits (particularly for lower gravity-darkening exponents), suggesting that the irradiation energy is deposited deep in the stellar photosphere. PSR~J1803$-$6707, on the other hand, displayed variability in the amplitude of its irradiation-dominated light curves over a time scale of a few months. This effect can be modelled only if the companion's filling, irradiation temperature, and convection coefficients are allowed to vary over time. Had the star been closer to filling its Roche lobe, like in the cases of the known transitional millisecond pulsars J1023+0038 and J1227$-$4853, this 4.1 per~cent variation in the volume-averaged filling of the star would have caused it to experience a state change to form an active accretion disc.",

We identify 14 AGN exhibiting rapid (on timescales of tens of kiloseconds) X-ray flux variations by factors of two or more that are statistically significant ($p\\le6\\times10^{-4}$), indicative of fast coronal variability. By converting minimum variability timescales to light-crossing times, we place upper limits on the sizes of the variable coronal regions, finding typical scales of $\\lesssim10^{-4}$~pc. The coronal variable region size upper limits of an AGN in our sample are found to be much smaller than the typical coronal sizes inferred from microlensing, suggesting that its corona is composed of localized, transient structures rather than smooth, homogeneous plasmas. Such efficient magnetic energy dissipation in compact volumes is consistent with expectations for magnetically dominated coronae and is supported by recent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Future high-throughput X-ray observatories will enable the detection of even faster coronal variability, providing direct constraints on the physical mechanisms driving plasma energization and flux fluctuation near supermassive black holes. Our results suggest that luminous AGN hosting massive black holes are prime targets for probing the small-scale structure and dynamics of AGN coronae.",

The black hole and its accretion disk fuel a thin precessing jet, whose spirals are well-observed. Surprisingly, disconnected gamma-ray tails have recently been discovered by H.E.S.S., HAWC and LHAASO, hundreds of light-years away and with energies of tens of TeV. We suggest that tens PeV neutron burst jets were ejected from the SS433 system over the past century. These beams of ultra high-energy PeVatron neutrons, by their in-flight beta decay and Inverse Compton scattering, could be the source of the enigmatic, distant and disconnected tens of TeV gamma-ray beams. These ultra-relativistic PeV neutron jets could have been formed during one of the system's rare and intense tidal eruptions, when tens of PeV protons collide CV October 2025 with thermal ultraviolet photons, creating delta resonances. Their decay into secondary neutron beams of tens of PeV is well consistent with observations. Alternative models appear uncompetitive.",

To study trends in frequencies and amplitudes, and possibly spectacular phenomena like resonant amplification, we perform a series of axisymmetric long-duration magnetohydrodynamic CCSN simulations of a 17 $M_\\odot$ progenitor using a finely spaced grid in initial rotation rate from 0.29 rad/s to 3.48 rad/s. We find that these rotating models produce GWs at frequencies of up to 3 kHz, higher than in typical non-rotating models in the literature. The high frequencies arise due to small polar radii of rapidly rotating proto-neutron stars and stabilization by angular momentum gradients at lower latitude. GW frequencies and amplitudes tend to decrease with faster rotation. Different from two complementary simulations without magnetic fields, the magnetohydrodynamic models are characterized by an absence of p-modes above the dominant high-frequency emission band. We find no indication of resonant mode amplification for any rotation rate, although a temporo-spatial and space-frequency analysis reveals some interesting couplings of quadrupolar motions across the proto-neutron star and the gain region. We find that linear mode analysis based on the spherically averaged structure becomes unsuitable in this regime of rapid rotation. More advanced perturbative techniques need to be developed to study the mode structure and mode interaction in the collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars.",

The analysis is carried out within a two-fluid formalism under the relativistic Cowling approximation, where the perturbation equations follow from the linearized energy-momentum conservation laws of both components. We find that the mass-scaled fundamental frequencies of the nuclear (dark) fluid in dark core (halo) configurations exhibit a remarkably tight correlation with the total stellar compactness. This universality persists across the dark matter parameter space explored in this study and is largely insensitive to the choice of nuclear equation of state. In contrast, we also find the breakdown of such universality with the tidal deformability, i.e, the same frequencies show substantial deviations from universality when expressed in terms of the tidal deformability. These contrasting behaviors highlight possible observational imprints of dark matter in neutron star interiors.",

G. Dai, K. S. Cheng 15 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, submitted High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are intense pulses with unknown origins. A subclass of repeating FRBs show some common features, such as associated compact persistent radio sources (PRSs), high burst rates, and large host-galaxy dispersion measures (DMs). Meanwhile, they show diverse DM and rotation measure (RM) variations, which cannot be explained by current models. A unified model urgently needs to be established. Here we show the first evidence for a supernova remnant surrounding the FRB 20190520B source. We then demonstrate that the five active repeating FRB sources associated with PRSs can be understood within a single model in which central objects are young magnetars in massive binary systems embedded in supernova remnants. This model naturally predicts distinct variations of DM and RM for repeating FRBs. Crucially, young magnetar wind nebulae can generate bright PRSs. As a magnetar becomes older, the luminosity of a PRS will fade, which can naturally explain less-luminous PRSs for some active FRBs. Our results support a unified population of active FRBs in dynamic magnetized environments.",

The initial setup consists of two idealized, spherical subclusters with a mass ratio below three, each permeated by turbulent magnetic fields, and we follow their mergers with a high-order accurate magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code. In parallel, we track the acceleration of cosmic-ray electrons (CRe) via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) at merger-driven shocks, together with radiative cooling and Fermi-II (turbulent) acceleration in the postshock region, employing a high-order Fokker-Planck solver. Synchrotron emission is computed from the simulated CRe distribution and magnetic fields. In this paper, we detail these numerical approaches and present the first results obtained with them. Two prominent axial shocks emerge along the merger axis; the shock ahead of the heavier subcluster systematically attains a higher Mach number, although it is more compact, than that ahead of the lighter subcluster. Turbulent magnetic fields--both inherited from the initial condition and amplified during the merger--produce patchy, fine-scale structures in the radio surface brightness. Because of the combined effects of turbulent acceleration, spatially nonuniform magnetic fields, and the curved geometry of merger shocks, the volume-integrated radio spectra show deviations from the canonical power-law steepening expected for a planar shock with a uniform field. Reacceleration of preexisting fossil CRe enhances the surface brightness. Our results highlight the coupled roles of merger dynamics, MHD turbulence, and CRe physics in shaping up the observed properties of radio relics in cluster outskirts.",

Tanvir, Yun Wang, Yu Rong, Run-Duo Liang, Zhi-Xing Ling, Dong Xu, Zhi-Ping Jin, Da-Ming Wei High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) EP241217a is an X-ray transient detected by the Einstein Probe (EP) lasting for about 100 seconds and without accompanying $\\gamma$-ray detection. The optical spectroscopy reveals the redshift of EP241217a is 4.59. By combining the $\\gamma$-ray upper limit provided by GECAM-C, there is a considerable possibility that EP241217a is a typical Type II gamma-ray burst (GRB), but it is fainter than the detection threshold of any available $\\gamma$-ray monitors (i.e., $E_{\\gamma,{\\rm iso}}\\lesssim10^{53}$ erg). The X-ray light curve exhibits a plateau lasting for $\\sim5\\times10^4$ seconds. However, the joint analysis with optical data suggests the presence of an achromatic bump peaking at $\\sim3\\times10^4$ s after the trigger, indicating the actual duration of the X-ray plateau may be significantly shorter than it appears. To interpret the achromatic bump, we adopt the scenario of a mildly relativistic jet coasting in a wind-like medium and encountering a rapid density enhancement of the circumburst medium, which is likely induced by the the interaction of the progenitor's stellar wind and the interstellar medium. However, this model cannot fully explain observed data, and some issues do exist, e.g., the observed spectrum is harder than the model prediction. Consequently, we conclude that the scenario of a mildly relativistic jet coasting in the wind-like medium cannot explain all observed features of EP241217a. In addition, some alternative models commonly invoked to explain X-ray plateaus are discussed, but there are more or less issues when they are applied to EP241217a. Therefore, further theoretical modeling is encouraged to explore the origin of EP241217a.",

Patterson, Stephen Fairhurst High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We investigate the prospects of observing residual eccentricity in a population of compact binaries by calculating the power in the eccentric harmonics, following the methodology in arXiv:2411.04187. Although most observed compact binary coalescences are expected to circularize before entering the sensitivity band of the ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, dynamical interactions in dense star clusters can lead to a fraction of these binaries with non-negligible eccentricity at the time of detection. To quantify the observability of eccentricity, we simulate a population of merging compact binaries and identify those which have sufficient power in sub-dominant eccentric harmonics to be clearly distinguishable from quasi-circular systems. We consider a binary black hole (BBH) population derived from globular cluster simulations with residual eccentricity distribution obtained from Cluster Monte Carlo (CMC) catalogs as well as a fiducial log-uniform model. Assuming the LIGO-Virgo network of GW detectors with their sensitivities achieved during LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Observing Run (O4), we find that the BBH population with measurable eccentricity will have a significantly higher median eccentricity $e_{\\mathrm{10Hz}}\\sim 0.3$ (with $90\\%$ range: $0.1 - 0.5$) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $\\sim 20$ ($90\\%$ range: $13 - 57$) compared to the observable population of BBHs.

Recently, GRB 191019A has been proposed to originate within the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), suggesting that some GRBs may occur in extremely dense environments, although this interpretation remains under debate. This scenario has drawn considerable attention, as AGN disks are promising sites that can host progenitors of both long and short GRBs, and whose dense, gas-rich environment could significantly influence jet propagation and afterglow emission. Yet, our theoretical understanding of the resulting afterglow signatures in such environments is limited, and further systematic exploration is required. In this study, we investigate how multi-wavelength afterglow light curves can be utilized as diagnostic tools to probe the nature of the circumburst environment. Our results show that in dense environments, GRB afterglows exhibit distinct frequency-dependent behaviors. For jets with large opening angles, the X-ray light curve displays a shallow decay or bump due to a transition from synchrotron to SSC dominance, while the optical and high-energy (GeV) light curves follow typical power-law decays. On the other hand, for small opening angles, the light curves exhibit wavelength-dependent jet breaks: the GeV and optical bands break simultaneously, while the X-ray break is delayed as the SSC component gradually compensates for the fading synchrotron component. These signatures provide potential diagnostics of GRBs occurring in dense media such as AGN disks.",

Gowri (3) ((1) Bar-Ilan University, (2) KTH Royal Institute of Technology, (3) Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER)) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Gamma-ray burst (GRB) X-ray light curves exhibit a variety of complex temporal structures, such as flares and plateaus. The origin of flares seen in many GRB early afterglows is still uncertain. Here, we analyze a sample of 89 GRBs, 61 of them with flares, both with and without a \"plateau\" phase. We fit the Swift-XRT light curves with synchrotron emission from a forward shock propagating into either a constant-density ISM or a stellar wind, and flares on top of that. We find that the flare light curves are not symmetric, with a decay time that is $\\sim$five times longer than the rise time. We do not find any differences in flare properties between GRBs with and without a \"plateau\" phase. Moreover, additional afterglow properties such as the electron power-law index and the end time of the plateau are consistent between bursts with and without flares. These results strongly indicate that flares originate from a mechanism distinct from that producing the plateau and afterglow. When looking at the prompt emission properties, we do find some tendencies: GRBs with flares tend to be brighter and longer lasting than GRBs without flares. We therefore conclude that, unlike plateaus, flares are unlikely to arise from an external origin and are more plausibly associated with prolonged central engine activity that lasts longer than the main episode that produces the prompt phase. As the plateau cannot have the same origin, this result excludes models of late-time energy injection as the source of the GRB plateau.",

Romero, Valentí Bosch-Ramon Accepted as Letter in Astronomy and Astrophysics. 4 pages + appendix High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) has revealed numerous ultrahigh-energy gamma-ray sources of unknown origin. We propose that a fraction of them can be explained by microquasar remnants, i.e., binary systems where mass transfer has ceased and the central engine is quenched. Cosmic rays injected during the active phase of a microquasar may remain confined within its cocoon and subsequently interact with nearby molecular clouds, producing bright gamma-ray emission through $pp$ collisions. Remnants of former super-Eddington systems can act as dark PeVatrons, releasing particles up to $\\sim$10 PeV that illuminate surrounding clouds producing gamma rays reaching hundreds of TeV. This scenario provides a natural explanation for several unidentified Galactic LHAASO sources.",

Andrew Howell, Curtis McCully Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a comprehensive optical and near-infrared spectroscopic study of SN 2024afav - a hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) that peaks at $\\approx$ -20.7 mag and exhibits an unusual multi-bumped light curve. Our spectroscopic observations, spanning phases of -14 to +160 d, reveal several unusual features: (i) a narrow (1,800 km s$^{-1}$) and blueshifted (11,000 km s$^{-1}$) absorption from H$\\alpha$ starting at +20 d; (ii) persistent optical and NIR He I lines at all available phases, showing double absorption structure in NIR spectra at +23 d, with a high velocity component at a similar velocity to H$\\alpha$; (iii) early appearance of nebular [O III] emission starting at $\\approx$ +50 d; and (iv) strong [O II] + [Ca II] 7300 Å emission complex starting at $\\approx$ +110 d. These unusual features, and their onset at the time of the light curve bumps, provide compelling evidence of circumstellar interaction between the SN ejecta and a nearby hydrogen-rich shell, as well as the presence of helium in both the outer layers of the progenitor star and in the circumstellar medium. A comparison of SN 2024afav to other SLSNe-I showing bumpy light curves and similar spectral properties (PTF10hgi, SN 2017egm, SN 2019hge), points to a rare sub-group of SLSNe-I in which CSM interaction provides an important modulation to the energy input.",

Submitted to ApJ. Corresponding authors: Hannah McCall, Aurora Simionescu, Caroline Kilbourne Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The XRISM/Resolve microcalorimeter directly measured the gas velocities in the core of the Virgo Cluster, the closest example of AGN feedback in a cluster. This proximity allows us to resolve the kinematic impact of feedback on scales down to 5 kpc. Our spectral analysis reveals a high velocity dispersion of $\\sigma_v$=262 (+45 / -38) km/s near the AGN, which steeply declines to ~60 km/s between 5 and 25 kpc in the northwest direction. The observed line-of-sight bulk velocity in all regions is broadly consistent with the central galaxy, M87, with a mild trend toward blueshifted motions at larger radii. Systematic uncertainties have been carefully assessed and do not affect the measurements. The central velocities, if attributed entirely to isotropic turbulence, correspond to a transonic ICM at sub-6 kpc scales with three-dimensional Mach number 0.69 (+0.14 / -0.11) and a non-thermal pressure fraction of 21 (+7 / -5)%. Simple models of weak shocks and sound waves and calculations assuming isotropic turbulence both support the hypothesis that the velocity field reflects a mix of shock-driven expansion and turbulence. Compared to other clusters observed by XRISM to date, M87's central region stands out as the most kinematically disturbed, exhibiting both the highest velocity dispersion and the largest 3D Mach number, concentrated at the smallest physical scales.",

Jarvis 7 pages, 6 figures, submitted to A&A Letters Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Observations of core-collapse supernovae suggest that some massive stars undergo intense mass loss shortly before explosion, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here we report evidence of giant outbursts of clumpy material from a massive star in the final decades before explosion. Photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric data of SN~2024qiw reveal a bumpy light curve, a broad H$\\alpha$ profile, and variable polarization, all consistent with interaction between SN ejecta and clumpy circumstellar material, implying a mass-loss rate of $\\gtrsim 10^{-2}$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Taken together, the most likely explanation is multiple major eruptions, similar to those of Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs), but occurring shortly before explosion. This challenges standard stellar evolution theory by requiring either that LBVs explode terminally, or that other evolutionary phases produce eruptive episodes. In spite of very high pre-SN mass loss, the resulting SN is of Type~II, rather than Type IIn, highlighting diverse and previously unrecognized late-stage mass-loss processes.",

C 85, 1368 (2025) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex) This study presents an energy-dependent analysis of seasonal variations in the atmospheric muon neutrino spectrum, using 11.3 years of data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. By leveraging a novel spectral unfolding method, we explore the energy range from 125 GeV to 10 TeV for zenith angles between 90° to 110°, corresponding to the Antarctic atmosphere. Our findings reveal that the seasonal variation amplitude decreases with energy reaching ($-4.6 \\pm 1.1$)\\% during Austral winter and increases ($+3.9 \\pm 1.2$)\\% during Austral summer relative to the annual average at 10TeV. While the unfolded flux exceeds the model predictions by up to 30\\%, the differential measurement of seasonal variations remains unaffected. The measured seasonal variations of the muon neutrino spectrum are consistent with theoretical predictions using the MCEq code and the NRLMSISE-00 atmospheric model.",

In previous works, we show that this model can produce: 1) light curves with a superposition of fast and slow components; 2) a Band-shaped spectrum whose parameters could follow the typical distribution of GRB observations; 3) both ``hard to soft\" and ``intensity tracking\" patterns of spectral evolution. In this work, through simulations of a large sample with methods established in previous work, we show that the ICMART model can also explain the observed empirical relationships (here we focus on the Yonetoku and Liang relations), as long as the magnetic field strength in the magnetic reconnection radiation region is proportional to the mass of the bulk shell, and inversely proportional to the initial magnetization factor of the bulk shell. Our results suggest that during extreme relativistic magnetic reconnection events, an increase in magnetic field strength leads to more intense dissipation, ultimately resulting in a weaker residual magnetic field.",

We consider a $\\gamma$ dimensional measure embedded in an $N$ dimensional space and discuss how to determine its dimension, both in $N$ dimensions and projected into $D$ dimensions. It is a highly non-trivial problem to decode the original geometry from lower dimensional projection of a high-dimensional measure. The projections are space-feeling, the popular box-counting techniques do not apply, and the Fourier methods are contaminated by aliasing effects. In the present paper we demonstrate that under the \"Copernican hypothesis'' that we are not observing objects from a special direction, projection in a wavelet basis is remarkably simple: the wavelet power spectrum of a projected $\\gamma$ dimensional measure is $P_j \\propto 2^{-j\\gamma}$. This holds regardless of the embedded dimension, $N$, and the projected dimension, $D$. This approach could have potentially broad applications in data sciences where a typically sparse matrix encodes lower dimensional information embedded in an extremely high dimensional field and often measured in projection to a low dimensional space. Here, we apply this method to JWST and Chandra observations of the nearby supernova Cas A. We find that the emissions can be represented by projections of mesoscale substructures with fractal dimensions varying from $\\gamma = 1.7$ for the warm CO layer observed by JWST, up to $\\gamma = 2.5$ for the hot X-ray emitting gas layer in the supernova remnant. The resulting power law indicates that the emission is coming from a fractal dimensional mesoscale structure likely produced by magneto-hydrodynamical instabilities in the expanding supernova shell.",

Recent microlensing surveys have discovered several free-floating planets that are not bound to any known stellar systems. Additionally, three interstellar objects, namely 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov, and 3I/ATLAS, have been detected passing through our solar system on hyperbolic trajectories. In this work, we search for FFOs on hyperbolic orbits that pass near millisecond pulsars (MSPs), where their gravitational influence can induce detectable perturbations in pulse arrival times. Using the NANOGrav 15-year narrowband dataset, which contains high-precision timing data for 68 MSPs, we conduct a search for such hyperbolic scattering events between FFOs and pulsars. Although no statistically significant events were detected, this non-detection enables us to place upper limits on the number density of FFOs as a function of their mass within our local region of the Galaxy. For example, the upper limit on the number density for Jupiter-mass FFOs ($\\sim 10^{-2.5} - 10^{-3.5}~M_{\\odot}$) obtained from different pulsars ranges from $5.25\\times10^{6}~\\text{pc}^{-3}$ to $5.37\\times10^{9}~\\text{pc}^{-3}$, while the upper limit calculated by combining results from all the pulsars is $6.03\\times10^{5}~\\text{pc}^{-3}$. These results represent the first constraints on FFO population derived from pulsar timing data.",

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are X-ray transients characterized by nearly regular recurring flares from galactic nuclei. Recent observations have confirmed that some QPEs occur in galactic centers that experienced a tidal disruption event (TDE) a few years earlier. This may be reasonably explained if QPEs are produced when a star orbiting a supermassive black hole passes through an accretion disk formed by the TDE. Based on this scenario, we investigate the expected QPE signatures in the early stages of TDEs, taking into account the time evolution of the accretion disk. In the early phase, the disk is in a super-Eddington accretion state. The interaction between the star and such a slim disk results in QPEs with durations of $\\sim 100-1000\\,{\\rm s}$ and temperatures of $\\sim 1-100\\,{\\rm keV}$, which are significantly shorter and hotter than those of the currently detected QPE population. These events are detectable with current X-ray telescopes, but their small duty cycle ($\\lesssim1\\,\\%$) and the potential presence of a massive disk wind may make detection challenging. We encourage early-time and long-term monitoring TDEs showing X-rays to capture these QPEs, as such detections would provide valuable insights into the disk formation process in TDEs.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are a new class of coherent radio sources with periods ranging from minutes to hours. Recently, two LPT sources, ILT J1101+5521 and GLEAM-X J0704-37, with periods of 2-3 hours has been confirmed to originate from white dwarf (WD) -- M dwarf (MD) binaries. In this work, we propose that at least some LPTs originate from the magnetic WD -- MD binaries in the pre-magnetic cataclysmic variables (pre-mCV) phase. The asynchronism between the WD's rotation and the binary's orbital motion allows for the unipolar-inductor mechanism or magnetosphere interaction to operate and accelerate radiating particles, with the dominant process depending on the magnetic moment ratio of the two stars. Under asynchronism condition, both the peak flux and the polarization of radio pulses will be modulated by the beat period. The pre-mCV phase characterized by an extremely low accretion rate provides the relatively clean magnetospheric environment necessary for a loss-cone-driven maser (LCDM) mechanism to operate, producing the LPT emission. The observed pulse duty cycle of $10^{-3}-10^{-1}$ is attributed to a beaming effect modulated by the binary's magnetic geometry. Furthermore, the magnetized environment of a WD--MD binary is conducive to Faraday conversion with weak coupling, which implies that the polarization state of LPTs should vary significantly at different periods. Finally, we predict that LPTs from WD--MD binaries should exhibit a period distribution following $f_P(P)dP \\propto P^{(1.67-2.33)}dP$ and a luminosity function described by $f_L(L)dL \\propto L^{-(1.80-2.67)}dL$, which can be tested by the future large sample.",

In our fiducial neutron-star merger model, the cosmic ray flux above $25$~EeV is dominated by ten nearby galaxies within $8\\,$Mpc.

We employ a support vector machine, previously shown to perform best among tested methods, to classify GW signals simulated for 18 EOS models. For optimally oriented sources, we estimate that the Advanced LIGO A+ detector can probe the EOS for Galactic events, while third-generation observatories such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer can reach substantially farther. For randomly oriented sources, only these next-generation detectors are expected to have sufficient sensitivity.

In black hole accretion systems, the scaling relations between the characteristic damping timescales (CDTs) of light curves and black hole mass offer valuable insights into the underlying physical structure of accretion disks. Here, we investigate the long-term hard X-ray CDTs of 106 black hole and neutron star accretion systems using light curves from the \\textit{Swift} Burst Alert Telescope 157-month catalog. Unexpectedly, for the first time, we discover a mass-independent CDT in these black hole accretion systems, in contrast to well-established scaling laws. This puzzling phenomenon can be attributed to conductive timescales arising from disk--corona interactions, instead of the intrinsic accretion disk processes characterized by scaling laws, and it may further modulate jet emission in blazars. This result demonstrates thermal conduction as a key mechanism driving hard X-ray variability and offers new observational evidence for the disk--corona--jet connection.",

Lazio, Kaitlyn Szekerczes, Steinn Sigurdsson, Collin Dabbieri Revised version posted after incorporating referee's comments Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Spectroscopic observations of the quasar J0950$+$5128 spanning 22 years reveal monotonic radial velocity variations in its broad H$\\beta$ emission line. Moreover, the line profile becomes broader over time, necessitating careful measurements. We present robust H$\\beta$ velocity shift measurements obtained via cross correlation, applied to both the full spectra and to isolated broad H$\\beta$ components derived from spectral decomposition. We also examine the light curves for variability consistent with the spectroscopic trends. Using Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis we find no significant periodic signal. We consider several interpretations for the observed changes, including a binary supermassive black hole, dust-cloud obscuration, outflows, a recoiling black hole, and a single perturbed, disk-like broad-line region. We disfavor all but the binary and perturbed broad-line region scenarios. The binary interpretation is the only one for which we can immediately compare a physical model to the available data. Thus, we incorporate radial velocity ''jitter'' to emulate typical quasar variability and fit the radial velocity curve with a Keplerian model to examine whether it can reproduce the observations. In this context, the available observations trace only a segment of the putative orbit. The fit yields a period of 33 years (observed frame) and an eccentricity of 0.65, with lower limits on the semi-major axis and black hole mass of $10^{-2}\\;$pc and $10^7\\;{\\rm M}_\\odot$, respectively. Thus, J0950$+$5128 is a compelling supermassive binary candidate. The single, perturbed broad-line region interpretation remains viable but requires additional observations and modeling for further evaluation. Continued monitoring is, therefore, essential.",

Himanshu Sharma, Vivek Kumar Jha, Hum Chand, Swayamtrupta Panda 12 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables and additional 2 figures in appendix. Submitted to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a comprehensive spectroscopic and variability-based characterisation of a sample of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) hosting low mass black holes, identified by $H\\beta$ full width at half maximum (FWHM) $< 2200$ km s$^{-1}$. While the narrow line widths are consistent with the formal definition of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies, the broader accretion and emission properties reveal key distinctions. The sample exhibits sub-Eddington accretion rates (median $\\log R_{Edd} \\approx -0.68$) and comparatively weak FeII emission (median $R_{FeII} \\approx 0.61$), in contrast to the strong FeII strengths and high Eddington ratios characteristic of classical NLSy1s. Optical variability amplitudes, derived from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) light curves, are similar to those typically seen in Seyfert 1 galaxies, with a median $\\log(\\sigma) \\approx -0.68$, suggesting the AGN component's significant contribution to variability. In the optical plane of the 4D Eigenvector 1 (4DE1) parameter space, these sources occupy a distinct locus in the low-$R_{FeII}$, low-$R_{Edd}$ regime, suggesting a physically distinct accretion state. Our findings indicate that this population may represent a low-accretion analogue within the broader narrow-line AGN family, offering new insights into black hole growth at low mass scales.",

Katy Rodriguez Wimberly, Jorge Moreno, Coral Wheeler, Pratik Gandhi, Andrew Wetzel, Robert Feldmann, Lucas Tortora, Jenna Samuel 18 pages, 7 figures, Submitted to ApJ, comments welcomed! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We compare satellite quenched fractions across three cosmological simulation suites (FIREbox, the FIRE-2 zoom-ins, and IllustrisTNG50) and observational datasets from SAGA, ELVES, and the combined satellite population of the Milky Way and M31. To enable consistent comparisons, we select Milky Way-mass hosts with $M_{\\rm halo} = 10^{11.9}$ - $10^{12.2} \\, M_{\\odot}$ and satellites with stellar masses of $10^{7}$ - $10^{10}\\, M_{\\odot}$, applying uniform projected apertures and a common quenching definition. All three simulations reproduce the strong observed trend that lower-mass satellites are more likely to be quenched, closely matching the stellar-mass dependence seen in SAGA, ELVES, and the MW+M31 system. This agreement indicates that the mass dependence of satellite quenching is a robust outcome of contemporary galaxy formation models. Radial trends, however, show meaningful differences. SAGA and ELVES exhibit gently declining quenched fractions with projected distance, reflecting strong environmental quenching at small radii. TNG50 most closely matches this behavior, FIREbox, remains consistent with with a nearly flat trend within uncertainties, and the FIRE-2 zoom-ins show suppressed inner quenched fractions driven almost entirely by their paired MW-M31 hosts, which lack high-mass satellites and show strong radial segregation between star-forming and quenched systems. This environmental imprint suggests that host environment and assembly history can influence satellite quenching outcomes and may contribute to diversity across simulations. Overall, while the simulations consistently recover the stellar-mass dependence of quenching their radial trends vary, highlighting the influence of host-halo conditions and motivating deeper exploration of how host environments shape satellite quenching.",

Meyer, Daniel Schaerer, Mengyuan Xiao 22 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables, Submitted to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The visibility of Lyman-$\\alpha$ emission at $z>7$ provides crucial insights into the reionization process and the role of galaxies in shaping the ionized intergalactic medium. Using JWST FRESCO data, we investigate the environments of Lyman-$\\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) in the GOODS-N and GOODS-S fields by identifying [OIII] emitters and analyzing their large-scale distribution. Using the FRESCO redshifts, we recover eight new LAEs from archival Keck/MOSFIRE observations at $z=7.0-7.7$, including a potential AGN candidate at $z \\sim 7.2$. Complemented by six literature LAEs, our sample consists of 14 LAEs in total, all of which are [OIII] emitters except for one very faint source not detected by FRESCO. We define seven groups of [OIII] emitters centered around the brightest LAEs and find that these bright LAEs do not reside in more overdense environments than the average galaxy population. The overdensity parameters for LAEs and [OIII] emitters without Lyman-$\\alpha$, calculated for sources with $\\mathrm{M_{UV}<-19.5}$ to ensure completeness, are similar, indicating that overdensities alone cannot fully explain Lyman-$\\alpha$ visibility. While LAEs have slightly higher recent star formation (SFR$_{10}$/SFR$_{50} \\approx 1.3\\times$) and [OIII] EW ($\\approx1.5\\times$), they show no significant differences from [OIII] emitters in UV slope ($\\beta$), UV magnitude ($\\mathrm{M_{UV}}$), or stellar mass ($\\log_{\\mathrm{M}_{\\star}}$). Our results suggest that other factors may contribute to the observability of Lyman-$\\alpha$ emission. Future spectroscopic surveys with broader wavelength coverage and more complete sampling will be crucial for refining our understanding of reionization.",

Virginia) 29 pages, 15 figures, submitted to ApJ, comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The SMC is in disequilibrium. Gas line-of-sight (LoS) velocity maps show a gradient of $60-100$ km s$^{-1}$, generally interpreted as a rotating gas disk consistent with the Tully-Fisher relation. Yet, the stars don't show rotation. Despite a small on-sky extent ($\\sim4$ kpc), the SMC exhibits a large ($\\sim10$ kpc) LoS depth, and the stellar photometric center is offset from the HI kinematic center by $\\sim$1 kpc. With N-body hydrodynamical simulations, we show that a recent ($\\sim$100 Myr ago) SMC-LMC collision (impact parameter $\\sim2$ kpc) explains the observed SMC's internal structure and kinematics. The simulated SMC is initialized with rotating stellar and gaseous disks. Post-collision, the SMC's tidal tail accounts for the large LoS depth. The SMC's stellar kinematics become dispersion dominated ($v/\\sigma\\approx0.2$), with radially outward motions at $R>2$ kpc, and a small ($<10$ km s$^{-1}$) remnant rotation at $R<2$ kpc, consistent with observations. Post-collision gas kinematics are also dominated by radially outward motions, without remnant rotation. Hence, the observed SMC's gas LoS velocity gradient is due to radial motions as opposed to disk rotation. Ram pressure from the LMC's gas disk during the collision imparts $\\approx30$ km s$^{-1}$ kick to the SMC's gas, sufficient to destroy gas rotation and offset the SMC's stellar and gas centers. Our work highlights the critical role of group processing through galaxy collisions in driving dIrr to dE/dSph transformation, including the removal of gas. Consequently, frameworks that treat the SMC as a galaxy in transformation are required to effectively use its observational data to constrain interstellar medium and dark matter physics.",

Globular clusters in particular represent a window for the study of the different merger events that a galaxy underwent. Establishing the correct classification of in-situ and accreted tracers, and distinguishing the various different progenitors that contributed to the accreted population are important tools to deepen our understanding of galactic formation and evolution. Our aim is to refine our knowledge of the assembly history of the Milky Way by studying the dynamics of its globular cluster population and establishing an updated classification among in-situ objects and the different merger events identified. We used a custom built orbit integrator to derive precise orbital parameters, integrals of motions and adiabatic invariants for the globular cluster sample studied. By properly accounting for the rotating bar, which transforms the underlying model in a time-varying potential, we proceeded to a complete dynamical characterisation of the globular clusters. We present a new catalogue of clear associations between globular clusters and structures (both in-situ and accreted) in the Milky Way, and a full table of derived parameters. By using all dynamical information available, we were able to attribute previously unassociated or misclassified globular clusters to the different progenitors, including those responsible for the Aleph, Antaeus, Cetus, Elqui, and Typhon merger events. By using a custom built orbit integrator and properly accounting for the time-varying nature of the Milky Way potential, we have shown the depth of information that can be extracted from a purely dynamical analysis of the globular clusters of our Galaxy.",

Provisionally accepted for publication in PASP Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a new deep multi-frequency radio survey of two extragalactic fields observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) as part of the SHORES project (Serendipitous H-ATLAS fields Observations of Radio Extragalactic Sources). The observations, centred at 2.1, 5.5, and 9 GHz, cover the central 0.5 deg$^2$ of two Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS) fields down to rms sensitivities of 9-17 $\\mu$Jy$/$beam at 2.1 GHz, 28-39 $\\mu$Jy/beam at 5.5 GHz and 38-61 $\\mu$Jy/beam at 9 GHz. This setup allows us to investigate the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of faint radio sources and probe the nature of the sub-mJy population. We extract and validate a robust catalogue of 489 sources at 2.1 GHz, 101 of which are also detected at 5.5 GHz. We perform a multi-frequency analysis of the radio number counts and derive the spectral indices of sources in the deep fields. The spectral index distribution of our sources peaks around $\\alpha \\sim -0.7$, consistent with synchrotron emission from the faint radio population. The number counts at 2.1 GHz are consistent with previous deep surveys and theoretical models, and provide a lower limit on the star-forming galaxy population, which is expected to dominate the faint end. The 5.5 GHz data offer new, direct constraints on the sub-mJy radio sky at higher frequencies. By cross-matching with the H-ATLAS catalogue, we identify a sample of sources with far-infrared (FIR) counterparts and explore the far-infrared-radio correlation (FIRRC). The sources with $q_{FIR} \\geq 1.69$ exhibit radio spectral indices typical of star-forming galaxies. Furthermore, we identify a population of radio-only sources with similar indices that may correspond to high-redshift SFGs, lacking counterparts in the FIR survey due to its limited resolution and sensitivity.",

K. Jang, Sukyoung K. Yi 23 pages (19p for main), 12 figures, under-review in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Intracluster light (ICL) is a key component of galaxy clusters, with the potential to trace their dynamical assembly histories and the underlying dark matter distribution. Despite these prospects, its faint nature makes a consensus on its origin or population properties difficult to achieve, both in observations and simulations. In the hope of finding a breakthrough, we utilize the ongoing high-resolution cluster simulation, NewCluster. By classifying billions of particles in and around the cluster with a rigorous tracking procedure, we find that the majority of the ICL originates from satellites, including surviving and disrupted galaxies. Another notable finding is that the preprocessed component follows the density profile of dark matter better than the other components and has distinctive properties: old age, low metallicity, and enhanced $\\alpha$-element abundance. We further investigate the orbital dynamics, and our results demonstrate that the stripped fraction of satellites is primarily determined by the time since infall and the pericenter distance. By linking the demographic, chemical, and orbital properties of ICL stars to their origins, this work proposes a quantitative approach for tracing the assembly history of galaxy clusters from the ICL.",

The majority of YBs are compact photodissociation regions generated by intermediate- and high-mass young stellar objects that are embedded in star-forming clumps ranging in mass from ten to one million solar masses and luminosity from ten to ten thousand solar luminosities. The MIRION catalog increases the number of candidate intermediate-mass star-forming regions (SFRs) by nearly two orders of magnitude, providing an extensive database with which to explore the transition from isolated low-mass to clustered high-mass star formation. The catalog comprises five tables that include mid- and far-infrared photometry; velocities of source-associated molecular clouds; distances to these molecular clouds; physical properties of source-associated star-forming clumps; and source crossmatches with other catalogs. The structure of the catalog enables users to easily sort objects for further study based on distance or environmental properties. Our preliminary analysis extends our earlier findings that indicate a relationship between IR colors and the physical properties and evolutionary stages of SFRs. Photometry will be periodically updated online to incorporate measurements from volunteers participating in a classroom activity known as the People Enabling Research: a Yellowball Survey of the Colors Of Protostellar Environments (PERYSCOPE) Project. These updates will continue to refine the IR flux measurements and reduce photometric errors. A follow-up paper will present a detailed analysis of how IR colors can be used to predict the properties of star-forming environments.",

      "abstract": "Effects of helium sedimentation on late star formation in galaxy clusters J. Racker, N. Padilla Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We discuss how helium sedimentation in galaxy clusters can affect the history of star formation in the central cluster galaxy. As helium sediments, the gas density in the inner regions of the cluster increases and there is also a non-trivial, radially dependent redistribution of the atomic nuclei and electrons. As a result, the cooling rate in the center increases and this can enhance star formation. On the other hand, there is a slow contraction of the intracluster gas, which may induce gravitational heating and therefore has an opposite effect on star formation. In this work we present these effects and aim to estimate their relevance. For this we have performed a 1-dimensional numerical simulation of helium sedimentation and applied it to a simple semi-analytical model of star formation. We find that for clusters with a halo mass $M_{\\rm halo} \\lesssim 10^{14} M_{\\rm sun}$, helium sedimentation effects on the star formation rate are negligible, even under idealized conditions. In the intermediate range, $10^{14} M_{\\rm sun} \\lesssim M_{\\rm halo} \\lesssim 10^{15} M_{\\rm sun}$, the effects are at most mild, below a factor ~ 2 in the isothermal model we consider, even for idealized conditions. For clusters with a halo mass $M_{\\rm halo} \\gtrsim 10^{15} M_{\\rm sun}$, helium sedimentation effects can potentially be very important and renew star formation activity in the central galaxy.",

Accepted by ApJS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Recent surveys of the Galactic plane have revealed dozens of giant molecular filaments (GMFs), with lengths ranging from tens to hundreds of parsecs, yet their origins and life cycles remain debated. In this work, we analyze over 700 GMFs identified from synthetic CO emission maps of a high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy, whose lengths range from $\\sim 10$ pc to $\\sim 300$ pc. We find that turbulent shock from galactic shear and stellar feedback are the primary drivers of GMF formation. Magnetized turbulence dominates their internal dynamics, supporting the filaments against global collapse while simultaneously inducing fragmentation into dense clumps. This fragmentation follows the turbulence-driven sausage instability model, rather than pure Jeans instability, and triggers efficient star formation along the filaments. Cloud-cloud collisions are frequent, affecting more than $70\\%$ of GMFs, and often disrupt or reshape their morphology. The typical filamentary lifetime is $t_{\\text{fil}} \\sim 14$ Myr, comparable to the crossing time of giant molecular clouds (GMCs). The molecular gas half-life is $\\sim 7$ Myr, similar to that of GMCs, indicating that GMFs are transient but dynamically important structures.",

Using co-spatial UV absorption and optical emission-line spectroscopy, we compare abundances of N, O, S, and Fe in the low-ionization (neutral) and high-ionization (ionized) gas, providing a multi-phase view of enrichment shortly after the current starburst and over longer timescales when ejecta from previous episodes have cooled and mixed. We find that O and S, produced predominantly in short-lived massive stars, are well mixed between the two phases, with scatter reflecting local inhomogeneities. Fe, predominantly produced by Type Ia supernovae on $\\sim$1 Gyr timescales, is higher in the neutral gas, reflecting either delayed mixing of older Fe-enriched material or preferential depletion of Fe from the ionized phase through dust formation in core-collapse supernova ejecta. N exhibits the largest phase offset, with N/H$_{ion}$ systematically $\\sim$0.7 dex higher than N/H$_{neu}$, and the magnitude of this offset correlates with stellar mass, metallicity, star-formation rate, and most strongly with the ISM outflow velocity. N/O ratios in the ionized phase rise rapidly within 3-6 Myr relative to the neutral gas, consistent with N enrichment dominated by Wolf-Rayet stars rather than intermediate-mass AGB stars on longer timescales. These results demonstrate that localized stellar feedback, outflows, and phase-dependent mixing collectively regulate the chemical evolution of star-forming galaxies, providing key insight into the extreme N/O abundances recently observed in galaxies at cosmic dawn.",

Pierce, Frits Sweijen Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The orientation-based unification model proposes that radio-loud quasars and radio galaxies are the same objects observed at different angles. A key prediction of this model is that the quasars are seen at smaller angles to the line of sight and so should be more affected by projection, and hence apparently physically smaller, than corresponding radio galaxies, but this has not always been found in earlier studies. We argue that the interpretation of observations requires a less simplistic model for the effects of projection, which takes into account radio sources' finite width and their intrinsic axial ratio distribution. Using this cylindrical configuration as a basis for the simulation of radio galaxies and quasars, we simulate the distribution of the linear size ratio of quasars to radio galaxies for different sample sizes and critical angles. Our simulations that predict the ratio of observed lengths in the presence of a distribution of intrinsic physical sizes and axial ratios that we derive from observation. We conclude that to test the unified scheme, samples should be completely optically identified, sizes should be measurable for all targets, and the sample size should be greater than $\\sim 800$ sources. Such large samples with uniform optical identification and accurate size measurements have not been available in previous work, but should become available from wide-area sky surveys in the near future.",

Antonov Accepted to A&A. 14 pages, 6 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) This work investigates the catalytic role of dust grains in forming aromatic hydrocarbons via acetylene cyclotrimerization on their surfaces within the circumstellar envelopes of carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We present a comprehensive computational astrochemical model coupling the gas-phase, gas-surface, and surface (cyclotrimerization) reactions, and the physical evolution of the dust grains (coagulation). The model expands upon the basic chemical network from previous models, enhancing them with updated reactions involving hydrocarbons up to pyrene. We applied this model to simulate the chemical evolution of the envelope of the prototypical AGB star IRC+10216, utilizing physical conditions derived from a hydrodynamical model available in literature. To quantify the impact of surface chemistry, we compared scenarios with and without the cyclotrimerization reaction, further testing the sensitivity of our results by varying the key parameter of hydrocarbon desorption energy. We find that surface-catalyzed cyclotrimerization is a viable pathway for aromatic formation in circumstellar environments, capable of enhancing the total abundance of aromatic species by up to an order of magnitude. Crucially, we show that gas-phase chemistry and dust surface processes are intrinsically linked; their synergistic evolution should be modeled self-consistently to accurately predict chemical abundances. This work underscores that constraining uncertain parameters, particularly desorption energies of hydrocarbons, is essential for future realistic modeling of astrochemical processes in evolved stellar systems.",

The code is a development of the AGAMA software package for action-based galaxy modelling and can be downloaded as the AGAMAb code library. Although coded in C++, most of its functions can be accessed from Python. We add to the package functions that facilitate confronting models with data, which involve sky coordinates, lines of sight, distances, extinction, etc. The new torus generator can produce tori for both highly eccentric and nearly circular orbits that lie beyond the range of the earlier torus-mapping code. Tori can be created by interpolation between tori at very low cost. Tori are fundamentally devices for computing ordinary phase-space coordinates from angle-action coordinates, but AGAMAb includes an action finder that returns angle-action coordinates from any given phase-space location. This action finder yields the torus through the given point, so it includes the functionality of an orbit integrator. The action finder is more accurate and reliable but computationally more costly than the widely used Staeckel Fudge. We show how AGAMAb can be used to generate sophisticated but cheap models of tidal streams and use it to analyse data for the GD1 stream. With the most recently published distances to the stream, energy and angular momentum imply that the end that must be leading is trailing, but extremely small changes to the distances rectify the problem.",

In the limit of vanishing angular momentum about the potential's symmetry axis, there is a clean distinction between box and loop orbits. We show that this distinction persists into the regime of non-zero angular momentum. In the case of a Staeckel potential, there is a critical value I_{3crit}(E) of the third integral I_3 below which I_3 does not contribute to the centrifugal barrier. An orbit is of box or loop type according as its value of I_3 is smaller or greater than I_{3crit}. We give algorithms for determining I_{3crit}(E) and the critical action Jzcrit below which orbits in any given potential are boxes. It is hard to compute the actions and especially the frequencies of orbits that have Jz ~ Jzcrit using the Staeckel Fudge. A modification of the Fudge that alleviates the problem is described.",

These results highlight the continued promise of other N-containing unsaturated PAHs, such as aromatic imines, as candidates for future laboratory studies and astronomical searches. In this work, we present broadband spectroscopic measurements of 9-iminofluorene and benzophenone imine in the 6-18\\,GHz band. These measurements yield accurate rotational, centrifugal distortion, and $^{14}$N quadrupole coupling constants for both molecules. Using these experimentally-derived constants, we attempted a search for both molecules in the cold molecular cloud TMC-1 using observations from the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). Neither of these two ketimines was detected above the current noise level, establishing upper limits for their column densities of $5.1\\times10^{12}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$ for 9-iminofluorene and $1.3\\times10^{13}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$ for benzophenone imine. We also attempted a search for phenylmethanimine (both E/Z isomers) as the simplest aromatic aldimine, but neither was detected in TMC-1. To provide insight into these non-detections, we propose and evaluate different formation pathways using respective potential energy surfaces as determined by high-precision quantum chemical calculations. The result suggests the presence of an entrance barrier to forming the intermediate species, potentially explaining the low abundance.",

Lagos, Rhea-Silvia Remus, Emily Wisnioski, Kathryn Grasha 16 pages, 11 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Connecting high-redshift galaxies to their low-redshift descendants is one of the most important and challenging tasks of galaxy evolution studies. In this work, we investigate whether incorporating high-redshift environmental factors improves the accuracy of matching high-redshift galaxies to their $z\\sim0$ descendants, using data from the EAGLE and MAGNETICUM simulations. Using random forest regression, we evaluate the relative importance of a set of environmental metrics at $z\\sim3$ in determining the stellar mass of descendant galaxies at $z\\sim0$. We identify the spherical overdensity within 1 cMpc ($\\delta_{1,\\mathrm{sp}}$) as the most important environmental predictor. Tracking galaxies at $z\\sim3$ with similar initial stellar masses but different $\\delta_{1,\\mathrm{sp}}$ values, we find that, across all mass bins in both simulations, high-density environments produce $z\\sim0$ descendants with median stellar masses up to eight times higher than the descendants of galaxies in low-density environments. For galaxies with $M_{*}\\lesssim10^{10}M_{\\odot}$, the difference is attributable to more merger-induced mass growth in high-density environments, whereas for higher-mass galaxies, it results from a combination of enhanced in-situ star formation and greater external mass accretion. By assessing the importance of overdensity across multiple scales and redshifts, we find that at $z\\gtrsim2$, environmental factors become as important as stellar mass in predicting the stellar mass of $z\\sim0$ descendants. Compared to using stellar mass at $z\\sim3$ alone, incorporating $\\delta_{1,\\mathrm{sp}}$ reduces the scatter in the residuals between the predicted and actual stellar masses by approximately 20% in EAGLE and 35% in MAGNETICUM.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present JWST/NIRCam imaging of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) detected by Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the Spiderweb protocluster at $z=2.16$. We identify 22 DSFGs detected by both ALMA and JWST, 10 of which are spectroscopically confirmed as protocluster members. This is the first systematic analysis of a statistical DSFG sample in $z\\sim2$ protocluster environments using JWST/NIRCam data. Most of the DSFG members exhibit very red colors and reside in the dusty star-forming region of the rest-frame UVJ diagram, indicating strong dust obscuration. The Gini-M20 diagram suggests that most DSFGs in this protocluster are late-type disks, with a significant fraction displaying clumpy and disturbed rest-frame UV/optical morphologies, but few showing clear merger signatures. The DSFG members exhibit relatively large stellar disks and effective radii with a median stellar mass of log(M/Msun) = 10.8 +/- 0.3, placing them above coeval field DSFGs and typical protocluster galaxies in the size-mass relation at both rest-frame optical and near-infrared wavelengths. These sizes are comparable to those of more evolved field DSFGs at z~1-2, indicating accelerated structural growth in dense environments. Moreover, these DSFG members show a decreasing trend in stellar size from shorter to longer wavelengths, with a moderately steep slope comparable to coeval field DSFGs. These results may support an inside-out growth scenario for protocluster evolution, in which massive galaxies near the center are more evolved and more strongly affected by AGN feedback and environmental effects, e.g., ram-pressure stripping. We propose that the cold gas accretion at the protocluster outskirts drives intense star formation and stellar disk growth in ALMA-detected DSFGs, which are expected to evolve into massive elliptical galaxies at later stages.",

Yi Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Understanding the alignment between AGN jets and their host galaxies is crucial for interpreting AGN unification models, jet feedback processes, and the co-evolution of galaxies and their central black holes (BH). In this study, we use the high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation NewHorizon, which self-consistently evolves BH mass and spin, to statistically examine the relationship between AGN jet orientation and host galaxy structure. Building upon our previous work, we extend the analysis of projected (2-d) alignment angles to facilitate more direct comparisons with recent observational studies. In our methodology, galaxy orientations are estimated using optical position angles derived from synthetic DESI-LS and Euclid images, while BH spin vectors serve as proxies for AGN jet directions. From a carefully selected sample of 100 BH-galaxy systems at low redshift, we generate a catalog of 5,000 mock optical images using a Monte Carlo approach that samples random viewing angles and redshifts. Our results reveal a statistically significant tendency for AGN jets to align with the orientation of their host galaxies, consistent with recent observations combining Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) and optical imaging of nearby AGNs. Furthermore, we find a slightly stronger alignment when using kinematic position angles derived from synthetic MaNGA-like stellar velocity fields. These findings underscore the importance of combining morphological, kinematic, and polarimetric information to disentangle the complex interplay between black hole spin evolution, accretion mode, and the galactic environment in shaping the direction of relativistic jets.",

We select a 330-galaxy sample from IllustrisTNG50 (TNG50) matched to 33 FEASTS galaxies by stellar and HI masses, and mock observe them to the FAST resolution and depth at corresponding inclinations and distances for a fair comparison. In contrast to FEASTS, abnormally irregular and extended morphology is found in more than one-third of TNG50 galaxies, especially those massive and HI poor. Stellar feedback is the property that most significantly correlates with the HI morphological deviation from observations, although these deviations mostly occur at a high stellar or black-hole mass. These results indicate that in TNG50, stellar feedback significantly influences the HI morphology at $10^{18}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$, while active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback has not so direct a role as expected.

Standard Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations achieve high signal-to-noise in bright regions but require prohibitively many photon packets to reach reliable depth in galaxy outskirts. By assigning stellar particles bias factors that scale with their smoothing lengths, our method boosts photon emission from low-density regions while conserving energy through weight corrections. Tests on a Milky-Way-like galaxy from the TNG50 cosmological simulation show that bias factors proportional to the smoothing length substantially extend the reliable LSB regime, providing an inexpensive improvement for deep synthetic imaging of simulated galaxies.",

Such methods for determining chaos as Poincaré sections and spectral methods have been compared. The relationship between the Poincaré sections and the spectral characteristics of the orbits has been estimated. The sample includes 45 globular clusters in the central region of the Galaxy with a radius of 3.5 kpc. To form the 6D-phase space required for integrating the orbits, the most accurate astrometric data to date from the Gaia satellite, as well as new refined average distances, have been used. The following, most realistic, bar parameters have been adopted: mass $10^{10} M_\\odot$, length of the major semi-axis of the bar model in the form of a triaxial ellipsoid is 5 kpc, angle of rotation of the bar axis is $25^o$, rotation velocity is 40 km s$^{-1}$ kpc $^{-1}$. The result of the study is that a 100\\% correlation between the classification by Poincaré sections and the spectral characteristics of the orbits has been established. Consequently, the classification by Poincaré sections can be replaced by a more visual analysis of the amplitude spectra of the orbits. Thus, two lists of GCs: with regular and chaotic dynamics have been compiled. The GCs with varying degrees of orbital chaos have separately been distinguish.",

Recent evidence suggests that the Sun might have formed through this process. However, the chemical conditions of shock-induced star forming region remain poorly constrained. We study the chemical complexity of a shock-impacted clump, with potential to yield star formation, named the Clump, and located at the interface between the SNR W44 and the infrared dark cloud G034.77-00.55. We test whether the Clump has chemical properties consistent with those observed in star forming regions unaffected by SNRs. We use high-sensitivity, broad spectral surveys at 3 and 7 mm obtained with the 30m antenna at IIRAM and the 40 m YEBES antenna, to identify D-bearing species and complex organic molecules (COMs) toward the Clump. For all species, we estimate molecular abundances and compare them with those observed across star forming regions at different evolutionary stages and masses, as well as comets. We detect multiple deuterated molecules (DCO+, DNC, DCN, CH2DOH) and COMs (CH3OH, CH3CHO, CH3CCH, CH3CN, CH3SH) with excitation temperatures of 5-13 K. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detection of COMs toward a site of SNR-cloud interaction. The derived D/H ratios (0.01-0.04) and COM abundances are consistent with those reported toward typical low-mass starless cores and comparable to cometary values. The overall level of chemical complexity is relatively low, in line with an early evolutionary stage. We suggest that the Clump is a early stage shock-induced low-mass star forming region, not yet protostellar. We speculate that SNR shocks may set the physical and chemical conditions to form stars. The resulting chemical budget may be preserved along the formation process of a planetary system, being finally incorporated into planetesimals and cometesimals.",

In ultra-luminous infrared galaxies, in which the star-formation rate reaches thousands of solar masses per year, the gas and dust are considerably affected by the ionizing radiation, cosmic rays and shock waves, that can be about a factor of 100--1000 larger than typical values in quiet star-forming galaxies. In these conditions, the emissivity of the gas and dust changes: in dense gas, high ionic and molecular transitions become excited, while dust grains are heated to high temperatures. In this paper, we analyze the possibilities for studying the interstellar medium in extreme conditions of ultra-luminous infrared galaxies at redshifts of $\\sim 0-3$, utilizing the atomic and molecular lines, and dust continuum in far infrared range of $100-500\\mu$m.

Fuller Submitted to A&A, comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Methods: We obtained adaptive optics-assisted integral field spectroscopy in the near-infrared (IR) $K$ band ($1.93-2.47 \\mathrm{\\mu m}$) with VLT/SINFONI, complemented by VLA X and C bands (3$-$6 cm) and ALMA band 3 ($\\sim$3.3 mm) observations. Results: The near-IR continuum reveals two infrared sources, IRS 2 and IRS 7, while the main protostellar core IRAS 18162-2048 remains undetected up to $2.47 \\mathrm{\\mu m}$. IRS 7 shows a peculiar Hydrogen Recombination Line Br$\\gamma$ profile with a narrow emission component superimposed on a broad absorption feature, consistent with a B2/B3 zero-age main-sequence star. Extended H$_2$ emission exhibits a `sawtooth' pattern in the excitation diagram, characteristic of UV radiation in a PDR rather than shock excitation. The radiative transfer model Cloudy reproduces the H$_2$ ro-vibrational populations for $T_\\mathrm{gas}=600$ K and $n_\\mathrm{H}=7.9\\times10^3 \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. VLA X and C bands observations reveal a compact radio source previously reported as a stationary condensation (SC) and coincident with IRS 7. For the first time, we detect IRS 7/SC in mm wavelengths. The spectral index in the 3$-$6 cm and 3.3 mm regime is consistent with optically thin free-free emission. Conclusions: Our near-IR and radio observations reveal that IRS 7/SC is a B2/B3 ZAMS star that has begun to photoionise its environment, giving rise to an extended PDR and a compact \\ion{H}{ii} region. The coexistence of this source with the deeply embedded protostar IRAS 18162-2048 and other bubble-like structures in the field, suggests a multigenerational star-forming environment. Future \\textit{James Webb Space Telescope} observations targeting the H$_2$ pure rotational lines ($3-28 \\mathrm{\\mu m}$) and other HRLs less affected by extinction will be essential to characterise the cooler molecular and ionised gas to fully disclose the formation history of the region.",

We find that radial alignment is substantially stronger than orbital alignment, with both signals being consistently stronger for subhalos than for satellites. Interestingly, inward- and outward-moving satellites/subhalos show contrasting orbital alignment behaviors, which can be understood in terms of their radial alignment, orbit decay due to dynamical friction and the effect of tidal stripping. The orbital alignment is stronger in more massive halos. In the end, we explore the orbital alignment measured by a mock observer, and find that the alignment reported by Pace et al. (2022) for MW satellites is due to projection effects, as the major axes of satellites lie within their orbital planes, approximately coplanar with the observer.",

Tissera, Antonela Monachesi, Brian Tapia-Contreras, Susana Pedrosa, Rosa Dominguez-Tenreiro, Lucas Bignone 13 pages, 8 figures, 1 appendix. Submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) This work investigates the presence and evolution of the MZhR from redshift z=3.5 to z=0, and identifies when galaxies settle on the present-day MZhR. We used central galaxies with log10(Mgal/Msun)=[9,11] from CIELO simulations. We identified stellar halos, from z=3.5 to z=0, using the AM-E method, focusing on the region between the 1.5 optical radius and the virial radius. We presented halo cardiograms, a novel approach to studying the assembly history of stellar halos. Using them, we defined a stability time (tst) as the first time that the median halo metallicity does not change more than \\pm 0.1 dex with respect to its value at z=0. CIELO stellar halos reproduce the present-day observed MZhR. At z=3.5, stellar halos already define an MZhR whose slope is similar to the slope at z=0. For a fixed stellar halo mass, the metallicity increases ~0.21 dex from z=3.5 to z=0, reflecting the progressive chemical enrichment provided by the accretion of satellites with diverse masses and different levels of enrichment. When the first stellar halo main contributor (SHMC1) provides a mass fraction at least 20% higher than the remaining contributors, the stellar halo metallicity is set once SHMC1 is fully disrupted (tmerger). This yields a clear correlation between tst and tmerger, with a scatter of 2.2 Gyr driven by the relative importance of the second and third main contributing satellites. We provide two observational tracers for tst: t90 and a stability time from the age-metallicity relation. Our results suggest that estimating tst could serve as a proxy for dating the moment at which the stellar halo reaches the present-day MZhR, as well as for dating the last major merger that builds them. Combined with an estimation of the merger time of the main contributing satellite, it can provide insights into the relative importance of the second and third contributing satellites. (abridged)",

Both systems show kiloparsec-scale soft X-ray emission. In FIRST J120041, the X-ray morphology is clumpy and closely follows the [O III] structures, with surface-brightness peaks co-spatial with the highest [O III] velocities (600-750 km s$^{-1}$) and broadest line widths (FWHM~1700 km s$^{-1}$). In 2MASX J130038, the X-rays are more centrally concentrated and only weakly correlated with the largely rotational [O III] kinematics. Spectral modeling indicates that photoionization dominates the soft X-rays in both quasars. The inferred hot-gas reservoirs are substantial, M$_{\\rm x-ray}$ ~ 4.5x10$^{8}$M$_{\\odot}$ (FIRST J120041) and M$_{\\rm x-ray}$ ~ 1.8x10$^{8}$M$_{\\odot}$ (2MASX J130038), exceeding the outflowing [O III] masses (volume-normalized) by factors of ~4 and ~16, respectively. In 2MASX J130038, we also identify a tentative blueshifted Fe XXVI Ly$\\alpha$ line at E$_{\\rm rest}$ = 7.14 $\\pm$ 0.06 keV (v~7600 km s$^{-1}$), consistent with a nascent hot wind confined to the inner few hundred parsecs. Combining these results with a broader sample of twelve type 2 quasars, we argue that luminous quasars evolve along a continuous feedback sequence regulated by the progressive clearing of circumnuclear gas. As AGN radiation and winds pierce through the surrounding medium, systems transition from heavily enshrouded, compact configurations to phases where the X-ray and [O III] components strongly couple and, eventually, to large-scale, energetically dominant outflows. FIRST J120041 and 2MASX J130038 represent two points along this sequence, tracing the emergence and growth of hot winds as primary drivers of quasar-scale feedback.",

Typically, this is done by measuring the fraction of young stars with infrared-excess, a sign of circumstellar material, in stellar clusters of different ages. However, comparing data from different star-forming regions at different distances introduces uncertainties and biases because of the different sample completeness and environment. This study addresses these challenges by analyzing 33 clusters, aged 3 to 21 million years (PARSEC isochrones), within the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association, sampling the stellar IMF from the hydrogen burning limit to about 8 M$_\\odot$. By using $\\mathit{Gaia}$, 2MASS, and WISE data, we identified stars with infrared-excess through color-color diagrams and spectral energy distributions, ensuring a consistent selection of disk-bearing sources. Our results indicate a disk lifetime of $5.8 \\pm 0.3$ Myr, about a factor of two longer than most previous estimates, suggesting that planet formation may have more time than previously thought. We also find that an exponential decay model best describes disk dispersal. These findings emphasize the importance of studying disk evolution in a single star-forming region to reduce uncertainties and refine our understanding of planet formation timelines.",

Machine-readable tables will be released upon acceptance for publication Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Detecting planets in open clusters offers a unique opportunity to test planet formation theories in clustered environments. The precisely determined ages of young open clusters make their planets particularly valuable for tracing the early evolution of planetary systems. As the second paper of the UPiC project, this study focuses on stars in stellar groups that host transiting planets or planetary candidates. We categorize these stellar groups into Open Clusters (OCs) and Moving Groups (MGs) based on the Jacobi radius to investigate potential differences in their planetary systems. By cross-matching the latest star cluster catalogs with catalogs of transiting planets and candidates, we have compiled the most extensive catalog to date, containing 106 confirmed planets and 168 candidates within OCs and MGs. We refitted the structural parameters of these stellar groups and identified substructures using the \\texttt{HDBSCAN} and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algorithms. Our analysis reveals the density evolution of both MGs and OCs during their first Gyr. We find that MGs consistently exhibit a significantly higher planet fraction than OCs, regardless of sample selection, particularly for Hot Jupiters. Furthermore, exoplanet radii show a clear dichotomy at early stages: most sub-Jupiters evolve into Neptune-sized planets within 100 Myr, while super-Jupiters undergo only minimal contraction. These results suggest that young sub-Jupiters (\\textless 100 Myr) represent puffy, Neptune-mass planets undergoing vigorous photoevaporation, whereas Jupiter-mass planets can maintain their atmospheres. We also report evidence for the early emergence of the hot-Neptune desert at 100 Myr in both OCs and MGs.",

At small Stokes numbers, shock trapping leads to extreme density inhomogeneities and nearly singular aggregation, with correlation dimensions approaching zero. With increasing inertia, particles undergo inertial escape and intermittently cross shock fronts, producing a sharp crossover from shock-dominated trapping to quasi-ballistic dynamics. This crossover is accompanied by a pronounced reduction in density fluctuations, a continuous increase of the correlation dimension from zero to the embedding dimension, and a power-law dependence of density fluctuations on the Stokes number over an extended intermediate regime. In this regime, particle distributions show scale-free coarse-grained density statistics arising from repeated trap--escape dynamics. This behaviour is qualitatively distinct from inertial-particle clustering in incompressible turbulence and is directly relevant to dust concentration in shock-rich regions of protoplanetary discs and other compressible astrophysical environments.",

Reach 19 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, submitted to ApJL Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) From 01- to 15-Aug-2025 UT, the SPHEREx spacecraft observed interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. Using $R = 40$-$130$ spectrophotometry at $\\lambda = 0.7$-$5\\mu$m, light curves, spectra, and imaging of 3I were obtained. From these, robust detections of water gas emission at $2.7$-$2.8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and CO$_2$ gas at $4.23$-$4.27\\,\\mu$m plus tentative detections of $^{13}$CO$_2$ and CO gas were found. A slightly extended H$_2$O coma was detected, and a huge CO$_2$ atmosphere extending out to at least $4.2\\times10^{5}\\,$km was discovered. Gas production rates for H$_2$O, $^{12}$CO$_2$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, and CO were $Q_{\\mathrm{gas}} = 3.2\\times10^{26} \\pm 20\\%$, $1.6\\times10^{27} \\pm 10\\%$, $1.3\\times10^{25} \\pm 25\\%$, and $1.0\\times10^{26} \\pm 25\\%$, respectively. Co-addition of all $\\lambda = 1.0$-$1.5\\,\\mu$m scattered light continuum images produced a high SNR image consistent with an unresolved source. The scattered light lightcurve showed $\\lesssim 15\\%$ variability over the observation period. The absolute brightness of 3I at $1.0$-$1.5\\,\\mu$m is consistent with a $< 2.5\\,$km radius nucleus surrounded by a 100 times brighter coma. The $1.5$-$4.0\\,\\mu$m continuum structure shows a strong feature commensurate with water ice absorption seen in KBOs and distant comets. The observed cometary behavior of 3I, including its preponderance of CO$_2$ emission, lack of CO output, small size, and predominance of large icy chunks of material in a flux-dominant coma is reminiscent of the behavior of short period comet 103P/Hartley 2, target of the NASA Deep Impact extended mission in 2010 and a ``hyperactive comet'' near the end of its outgassing lifetime. This correspondence places 3I closer to barely- or non-active 1I/Oumuamua than primitive, ice rich 2I/Borisov, suggesting that ISOs are often highly thermally processed before ejection into the ISM.",

Ekström Accepted for publication at A&A Journal Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Massive stars and their winds have a large influence in their environment, e.g, determining the accretion rate on to the Galactic Centre (GC) super-massive black hole Sgr A*. The winds of those stars collide and are accreted, at a rate that depends on their chemical composition. Here we aim to revisit the evolutionary status of the evolved massive stars at the GC, by means of new tracks based on updated mass-loss rate recipes for the earlier stages of massive stars. We use the Geneva-evolution-code for initial stellar masses ranging from 20 to 60 $M_\\odot$, for metallicity $Z=0.020$. We adopt a new mass-loss rate recipe for the line-driven winds of O-type stars and B-supergiants, plus a new recipe for the dust-driven winds of red supergiants (RSG). Additionally, we set up initial rotation $\\Omega/\\Omega_\\text{crit}=0.4$, and we adopt the Ledoux criterion for the treatment of convection in inner layers. We found that evolution models adopting new mass-loss rate prescriptions predict that stars will lose less of their outer layers during their initial phases, while a big reduction of mass happens at the RSG phase. As a consequence, the resulting Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are less radially homogeneous in their inner structure from the core to the surface. Also, these new evolution models predict the absence of hydrogen-free WN stars. These evolutionary predictions agree better with the observed chemical abundances of the WR stars at the GC. We provide a table with the chemical H, He, and CNO abundances calculated for the different subtypes of WR stars. We propose a different re-arrangement of the WR subtypes to be used for the modelling of the collision of their winds. We discuss the potential implications of these changes for the colliding winds generated from the massive stars at the GC, which are accreting onto the supermassive black hole Sgr A*.",

There are sophisticated kinetic theories that describe some aspects of galaxy disk dynamics, but extracting quantitative predictions from those theories has proven very difficult, meaning they have shed little light on observations/simulations of galaxies. Here, we begin to address this issue by developing a tractable theory describing fluctuations and transport in thin galactic disks. Our main conceptual advance is to split potential fluctuations into asymptotic wavelength regimes relative to orbital guiding radius and epicyclic amplitude (similar to plasma gyrokinetics), and then to treat separately the dynamics in each regime. As an illustration, we apply our results to quasilinear theory, calculating the angular-momentum transport due to a transient spiral. At each stage we verify our formulae with numerical examples. Our approach should simplify many important calculations in galactic disk dynamics. In a follow-up paper, we apply these ideas to the theory of linear spiral structure in stellar disks.",

Accepted by ApJ. DOI: https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ae1b9b Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We report the discovery of 13 broad-line AGNs at $z = 5 - 8$ from the first 10% data of the JWST Cycle 3 Treasury Program COSMOS-3D. These AGNs are identified by their broad H$\\alpha$ or H$\\beta$ emission lines through the NIRCam grism wide-field slitless spectroscopy. One object at $z = 7.646$ with broad H$\\beta$ emission has an F444W magnitude of 23.6 mag, making it one of the brightest $z > 7.5$ broad-line AGNs yet known. Among the 13 AGNs, 10 objects have reddened optical continua with slopes $\\beta_{\\rm opt}>0$. The remaining three objects have their overall SEDs that resemble those of UV-luminous quasars at similar redshifts, but their $\\beta_{\\rm opt}$, though negative, are not as blue as those of unobscured quasars. We also obtain MIRI photometry at 7.7-18 $\\mu$m for two AGNs and place strong constraints on their rest-frame near-IR SED. We find no significant variability in the rest-frame UV by comparing the COSMOS-3D and COSMOS-Web F115W images taken apart by 60 days in the rest-frame. We compute the H$\\alpha$ luminosity functions (LFs) for the broad H$\\alpha$ emitters at $z \\approx 5-6$ and find a potential redshift evolution when compared with that of the $z \\approx 4-5$ sample. We also derive the H$\\beta$ LF at $z\\sim8$ for AGNs and galaxies by combining our sample with those from the literature. The broad H$\\beta$ emitters in this work suggest a number density two orders of magnitude higher than that predicted by the quasar LF based on rest-frame UV-selected samples. As a preview, our work showcases the ability of the COSMOS-3D grism survey to provide a complete view of the properties, growth, and evolution of bright broad-line AGNs at $z>5$.",

Submitted to the Open Journal of Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The unexpectedly high abundance of galaxies at $z > 11$ revealed by JWST has sparked a debate on the nature of early galaxies and the physical mechanisms regulating their formation. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has begun to provide vital insights on their gas and dust content, but so far only for extreme 'blue monsters'. Here we present new, deep ALMA observations of JADES-GS-z11-0, a more typical (sub-$L^*$) $z > 11$ galaxy that bridges the discovery space of JWST and the Hubble Space Telescope. These data confirm the presence of the [O III] 88 $\\mu$m line at $4.5\\sigma$ significance, precisely at the redshift of several faint emission lines previously seen with JWST/NIRSpec, while the underlying dust continuum remains undetected ($F_\\nu < 9.0 \\, \\mathrm{\\mu Jy}$), implying an obscured star formation rate (SFR) of $\\text{SFR}_\\text{IR} \\lesssim 6 \\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot \\, yr^{-1}}$ and dust mass of $M_\\text{dust} \\lesssim 1.0 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ (all $3\\sigma$). The accurate ALMA redshift of $z_\\text{[O III]} = 11.1221 \\pm 0.0006$ ($\\gtrsim \\! 5\\times$ refined over NIRSpec) helps confirm that redshifts measured purely from the Lyman-$\\alpha$ break, even spectroscopically, should properly take into account the effects of potential damped Lyman-$\\alpha$ absorption (DLA) systems to avoid systematic overestimates of up to $\\Delta z \\approx 0.5$. The [O III] 88 $\\mu$m luminosity of $L_\\text{[O III]} = (1.1 \\pm 0.3) \\times 10^{8} \\, \\mathrm{L_\\odot}$, meanwhile, agrees well with the scaling relation for local metal-poor dwarfs given the SFR measured by NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI. The spatially resolved MIRI and ALMA emission also underscores that JADES-GS-z11-0 is likely to consist of two low-mass components that are undergoing strong bursts of star formation yet are already pre-enriched in oxygen (~20-30% solar), only 400 Myr after the Big Bang.",

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened such investigations by detecting the host galaxies of AGN and more luminous quasars within the first billion years of the universe (z > 6). Here, we evaluate the relation between the mass of SMBHs and the total stellar mass of their host galaxies using a sample of nine quasars at 6.18 < z < 6.4 from the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) survey with NIRCam and NIRSpec observations. We find that the observed location of these quasars in the SMBH-galaxy mass plane (log M_BH/Msun ~ 8-9; log M_*/Msun ~ 9.5-11) is consistent with a non-evolving intrinsic mass relation with dispersion (0.80_{-0.28}^{+0.23} dex) higher than the local value (~0.3-0.4 dex) of their more massive descendants. Our analysis is based on a forward model of systematics and includes a consideration of the impact of selection effects and measurement uncertainties with an assumption on the slope of the mass relation. While degeneracies between parameters persist, the best-fit solution has a reasonable AGN fraction (2.3%) of galaxies at z ~ 6 with an actively growing UV-unobscured black hole. In particular, models with a substantially higher normalisation in M_BH would require an unrealistically low intrinsic dispersion (~0.22 dex). Consequently, our results predict a large population of AGNs at lower black hole masses, as are now just starting to be discovered in focused efforts with JWST.",

Koekemoer, Feng-Yuan Liu, Pablo G. Pérez-González, Kate Rowlands, Ryan L. Sanders, Dirk Scholte, Alice E. Shapley, Maya Skarbinski, Thomas M. Stanton, Vivienne Wild Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We select a mass-complete sample of 225 quiescent galaxies at $z>2$ with $M_* > 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ from PRIMER and JADES photometry spanning a total area of $\\simeq320$ sq. arcmin. We restrict our analysis to only area with optical coverage in three $HST$ ACS filters, and provide evidence that this is important for selecting the most complete and clean samples of $z>2$ massive quiescent galaxy candidates. We investigate the contamination in our sample via $JWST$ NIRSpec spectroscopic validation, $Chandra$ X-ray imaging, and ALMA interferometry, calculating a modest total contamination fraction of $12.9_{-3.1}^{+4.0}$ per cent. The removal of $HST$ data increases star-forming galaxy contamination by $\\simeq10$ per cent and results in a $\\simeq20$ per cent loss of candidates recovered from $HST$+$JWST$ data combined. We calculate massive quiescent galaxy number densities at $2<z<5$, finding values three times larger than pre-$JWST$ estimates, but generally in agreement with more-recent and larger-area $JWST$ studies. In comparison with galaxy evolution simulations, we find that most can now reproduce the observed massive quiescent galaxy number density at $2<z<3$, however they still increasingly fall short at $z>3$, with discrepancies of up to $\\simeq 1$ dex. We place 14 of our $z>3$ massive quiescent galaxies on the BPT and WHaN diagrams using medium-resolution spectroscopic data from the EXCELS survey. We find a very high incidence of faint AGN in our sample, at a level of $\\simeq50$ per cent, consistent with recent results at cosmic noon. This is interesting in the context of maintenance-mode feedback, which is invoked in many simulations to prevent quenched galaxies from re-igniting star formation. To properly characterise the evolution of early massive quiescent galaxies, greater coverage in optical filters and significantly larger spectroscopic samples will be required.",

      "abstract": "Disclosing Submillimeter Galaxy Formation: Mergers or Secular Evolution? Siu-Wang Chan, Yiping Ao, Qinghua Tan Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We analyze the morphology of 125 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the PRIMER-COSMOS field using double Sersic modeling on JWST NIRCam images across six bands (F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M and F444W), with SMGs being classified by bulge Sersic index (n_bulge) and bulge-to-total luminosity ratio (B/T). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between the bright (SFR > 175 M_sun yr^{-1}) and the faint group (SFR < 175 M_sun yr^{-1}) reveals no significant statistical differences in morphology across bands. However, we notice that SMGs skew towards higher B/T ratios and lower n_bulge from shorter to longer wavelengths. In F444W, bright SMGs exhibit higher B/T and lower n_bulge, indicating flatter, disturbed bulges, while faint SMGs show lower B/T and higher n_bulge. Notably, SMGs with higher B/T tend to have low Sersic index, challenging the local universe dichotomy of classical bulges (B/T > 0.5, n > 4) versus pseudo-bulges (B/T < 0.35, n < 2). In the F277W band, non-parametric measurements indicate predominantly disk-dominated patterns, with only 24 percent of SMGs demonstrating merger signatures. After the removal of SMGs with disturbed morphology, the bulge classification scheme in F277W shows pseudo-bulges (21 percent) and clump migration bulges (16 percent) from secular evolution, compared to 4 percent merger-built bulges. Surprisingly, 48 percent of SMGs defy the classification scheme, showing high B/T (approximately 0.7) but low Sersic index (n_bulge <= 1). Bars are confirmed in 7 percent of SMGs. This work suggests that secular evolution takes precedence over major mergers, supporting the idea that isolated evolution fueled by filamentary gas inflow plays a non-negligible role in the SMG bulge formation.",

The Extinction Curve Lucía Bravo Ferres, Francisco Nogueras-Lara, Rainer Schödel, Rubén Fedriani, Adam Ginsburg, Samuel Crowe, Jonathan C. Tan, Morten Andersen, Joseph Armstrong, Yu Cheng, Zhi-Yun Li 14 pages, 11 figures, accepted version Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Determining the infrared extinction curve towards the Galactic centre is crucial for accurately correcting observed data and deriving the underlying stellar populations. However, extinction curves reported in the literature often show discrepancies. We aim to derive the infrared extinction curve towards the Galactic centre based on JWST-NIRCam data for the first time, using observations of the Sagittarius C region in the 1-5 $\\mu$m range. We determined extinction ratios using two different methods, both based on measuring the reddening vector using the slope of red clump stars, whose intrinsic properties are well known, in observed colour-magnitude diagrams. The extinction curve derived in this work is in good agreement with previous results in the literature. We obtained the following extinction ratios relative to F162M: $A_\\mathrm{F115W} : A_\\mathrm{F162M} : A_\\mathrm{F182M} : A_\\mathrm{F212N} : A_\\mathrm{F360M} : A_\\mathrm{F405N} : A_\\mathrm{F470N} : A_\\mathrm{F480M} = 1.84 \\pm 0.03 : 1.00 : 0.789 \\pm 0.005 : 0.607 \\pm 0.014 : 0.306 \\pm 0.011 : 0.248 \\pm 0.017 : 0.240 \\pm 0.019 : 0.21 \\pm 0.03$. Besides, we found different values of the extinction index for the short- ($\\lambda \\sim 1-2.5\\,\\mu$m, $\\alpha \\sim 2$) and long-wavelength ($\\lambda \\sim 2.5-5\\,\\mu$m, $\\alpha \\sim 1.4$) regimes, with the extinction curve flattening at longer wavelengths. Comparison with extinction curves derived both inside and outside the Galactic centre suggests that the infrared extinction curve does not significantly vary in the central regions, and shows no significant evidence for variations between different lines of sight beyond the inner Galaxy within the uncertainties.",

Two observations, targeting the cluster X-ray core and the prototypical cold front, were performed with exposures of 105 ks and 276 ks, respectively. We find that the gas in the core is blueshifted by $v_z\\sim-200$ km s$^{-1}$ relative to the brightest cluster galaxy, while the low-entropy gas inside the cold front is redshifted by $v_z\\sim 200$ km s$^{-1}$. As one moves further off-center across the front, the line-of-sight (LoS) velocity changes significantly, by $\\Delta v_z=535^{+167}_{-154}$ km s$^{-1}$, back to the value similar to that in the core. There are no significant LoS velocity gradients perpendicular to the cluster symmetry axis. These features suggest that the gas forming the cold front is flowing in the plane oriented along the LoS, supporting an offset merger scenario in which the main cluster has passed in front of the subcluster and induced rotation of the core gas in the plane perpendicular to the sky. The region just inside the front exhibits the largest LoS velocity dispersion seen across two pointings, $\\sigma_z\\sim420$ km s$^{-1}$, which can be interpreted as a developing turbulence or a projection of the LoS velocity shear within the front. The large LoS velocity jump across the cold front, combined with the lack of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the surface of the front, suggests some mechanism to suppress it. For example, a magnetic field with $B>5\\,\\mu$G is required if the cold front is stabilized by magnetic draping.",

Gandhi, Elia Cenci, Robert Feldmann, Michael Boylan-Kolchin, Andrew Wetzel, James S. Bullock, Philip F. Hopkins 23 pages, 9 figures, accepted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) It is widely believed that the ultraviolet background produced during the epoch of reionization conspires against the formation of low-mass galaxies. Indeed, this mechanism is often invoked as a solution to the so-called `missing satellites problem.' In this paper we employ FIREbox, a large-volume cosmological simulation based on the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) physics model, to characterize the mechanisms governing galaxy ignition in the post-reionization era. By carefully matching recently-ignited halos (with stellar ages below $100$ Myr at the time of selection) to halos that failed to form any stars, we conclude that the presence of cold-dense gas and halo concentration help incite the process of galaxy formation. Concretely, we find that $100\\%$ of recently-ignited halos experience cold-dense gas enhancements relative to their matched failed counterparts. Likewise, approximately $83\\%$ display enhancements in both cold-dense gas and Navarro-Frenk-White concentration ($c_{\\rm NFW}$), while the remaining $\\sim17\\%$ exhibit enhanced cold-dense gas content and suppressed $c_{\\rm NFW}$ values. Lastly, our simulation suggests that galaxy ignition can occur as late as $z=2$, potentially allowing us to observationally catch this process `in the act' in the foreseeable future.",

Insights from condensation experiments and mid-infrared spectroscopy Hanako Enomoto, Aki Takigawa, Hiroki Chihara, Chiyoe Koike Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Amorphous silicate dust is a major component in the interstellar and circumstellar dust formed in the outflow of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Although iron depletion is observed in the interstellar medium (ISM), the exact form and fraction of iron in solid remains under debate. In particular, it is unclear whether amorphous silicate dust around AGB stars contains metallic iron. We aimed to provide optical constants of amorphous silicate nanoparticles and examine the effects of metallic iron on their spectral features to better constrain the dust properties by producing amorphous silicate nanoparticles with and without metallic cores. We performed condensation experiments using an induction thermal plasma system to produce dust analogues of the CI chondritic composition in the Mg-Ca-Na-Al-Si-Fe-Ni-O and Mg-Ca-Na-Al-Si-O systems. We measured the absorbance and reflectance of the samples, observed the structure of the products, and determined the optical constants. Two types of amorphous silicate nanoparticles (10-200 nm in diameter) with nearly CI chondritic composition were produced: one contained kamacite (Fe: Ni=0.9: 0.1) cores with a diameter ratio ranging 0-0.87 (average ~0.50), and the other was iron-free homogeneous amorphous silicate. The amorphous silicates of the CI chondritic composition with various sized metallic cores may be prevalent in circumstellar and interstellar dust.",

Dickey, Ettore Carretti Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We probe the three-dimensional geometry of the large-scale Galactic magnetic field within 1 kpc of the Sun using the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO) Global Magneto-Ionic Medium Survey (GMIMS) of the Northern Sky (DRAGONS). DRAGONS is a new full polarization survey of the Northern sky from 350 to 1030 MHz covering declinations -20° < $\\delta$ < 90° and a component of GMIMS. The first moment of the Faraday depth spectra produced from DRAGONS above 500 MHz reveals large-angular-scale Faraday depth structures with signs that alternate only once in the Southern Galactic hemisphere and twice in the Northern hemisphere, patterns shared by other Faraday rotation datasets. DRAGONS is the first survey to achieve high Faraday depth resolution while maintaining sensitivity to broad Faraday depth structures, enabling the first use of Galactic longitude-Faraday depth plots. These plots reveal Faraday-complex structures across the sky, indicating a slab-like scenario in which emission and Faraday rotation are mixed. This complexity is overlaid on the same large-scale Faraday depth patterns that appear in the first moment map. We model these patterns as a magnetic reversal slicing through the disk on a diagonal and passing above the Sun in Galactic coordinates. We describe this reversal as a plane with a normal vector parallel to the line directed along ($\\ell$, b) = (168.5°, -60°) and estimate its distance to be between 0.25 and 0.55 kpc. Our results show that much of the observed Faraday sky may be dominated by the local magnetic field configuration.",

Three nights of precise (70 cm/s) radial velocity (RV) asteroseismology with the Keck Planet Finder clearly detect 5-minute oscillations from the primary HR 7672A, and modeling of the frequency spectrum yields an asteroseismic age of $1.87\\pm0.65$ Gyr. We also determine a gyrochronological age of $2.58\\pm0.47$ Gyr, and we combine these two results for a final age of $2.26\\pm0.40$ Gyr. In addition, we obtained new RVs for HR 7672A and new astrometry for the companion HR 7672B. From a joint orbit fit, we measured a dynamical mass of $1.111\\pm0.017$ $M_\\odot$ for HR 7672A and $75.39\\pm0.67$ $M_{\\rm Jup}$ for HR 7672B. This places the companion near the stellar/substellar boundary and thus particularly sensitive to differences in model predictions. The joint precision in host star age (18\\% uncertainty) and companion mass (0.9\\% uncertainty) makes HR 7672AB an exceptional substellar benchmark. Combined with the companion's luminosity, we use these measurements to test predictions from six brown dwarf cooling models. The best agreement occurs with the Chabrier et al. (2023) models, which incorporate a new equation of state, resulting in predictions that agree within $<$0.3$\\sigma$ with all the observations. The other 5 sets of models agree at the 1--3$\\sigma$ level depending on the particular test, and some models struggle to predict a sufficient low luminosity for HR 7672B at any age given its dynamical mass. Finally, we detected a weak seismic signal in near-simultaneous TESS photometry of HR 7672A, with the resulting RV-to-photometry oscillation amplitude ratio consistent with solar values.",

This object exhibited an outburst with a large amplitude of $>7.9$ magnitudes and was observed for over a month. The photometric evolution of the superoutburst was atypical for WZ Sge-type dwarf novae. Periodogram analisys reveals early superhumps with the most probable period of $0.0611\\pm0.0001$ days during the initial decline. After a plateau phase of approximately 11 days, ordinary superhumps (likely stage B) emerged with a period of $0.0616\\pm0.0001$ days, corresponding to a superhump excess of $\\epsilon=0.008$ correspondingly. This delay in the onset of ordinary superhumps is an unusual feature among WZ Sge stars. We evaluated the main parameters of the system: mass ratio $q=M_{RD}/M_{WD}=0.06\\pm0.005$, yielding component masses of $M_{WD}\\sim1.0\\pm0.15M_{\\odot}$ for the white dwarf and $M_{RD}=0.06\\pm0.01M_{\\odot}$ for the donor. The estimated distance to the system is $\\sim850$ pc, and the binary separation is $a=0.67\\pm0.03R_{\\odot}$.",

      "abstract": "Small EUV Brightenings in the Quiet Solar Atmosphere: New Insights from the Solar Orbiter Mission Susanna Parenti Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) One of the many outcomes of the Solar Orbiter mission is the evidence for the solar atmosphere being filled by highly impulsive bursts, down to about 200 km scale: the limit of the EUV instruments' spatial resolution. Small-scale events of this kind were already known, but their observation was occasional or with limited, lower resolution. Solar Orbiter has revealed that small scale, highly impulsive events are everywhere on the quiet Sun, all the time, at even smaller scales. Their similarity with known larger features, are the witnesses that the physical processes causing them are independent of the spatial scales involved. Their highly dynamic property is the signature of energy transfer and/or local dissipation. Their investigation can thus elucidate on the dominant physical processes acting on the solar atmosphere and on the possible role in the origin of the hot solar corona. In this review, we will present a summary of the observational and simulation results on this topic, led by the results from data taken by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI)/High Resolution Imagers (HRIEUV) instrument. Here, we will cover both statistical properties and analyses of individual events.",

This study combines ground-based observations conducted at a Southern Hemisphere observatory in Argentina with data from the TESS mission. Investigating the orbital period variations of EZ Oct reveals a steadily increasing period consistent with a quadratic trend. We present a new ephemeris and estimate the mass transfer rate as \\dot{M}=1.353*10^{-8} M_{\\odot}/year, indicating ongoing conservative mass transfer from the less massive to the more massive star. Light curve modeling was performed using the PHOEBE Python code in conjunction with the MCMC approach, and the inclusion of a cold starspot was required to achieve an adequate fit. Absolute parameters were estimated using Gaia DR3 parallax and astrophysical equations. Our analysis shows that EZ Oct is a total-eclipse contact binary with a mass ratio of 1.969, a fillout factor of 0.106, and an inclination of 82.13deg. Based on the stellar masses and temperatures of the components, the target system belongs to the W-subtype of contact binaries. The positions of the component stars were displayed on the mass-luminosity and mass-radius diagrams to illustrate their evolutionary status. Moreover, we investigated the relationship between orbital period and stellar luminosity in contact binary stars using a sample of 461 systems with P<0.5 days. We highlight the position of EZ Oct in the mass ratio-inclination parameter space, showing that it lies within the densely populated region of contact binaries.",

Submitted to Journal of Plasma Physics Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) The solar wind is observed to undergo substantial heating as it expands through the heliosphere, with measured temperature profiles exceeding those expected from adiabatic cooling. A plausible source of this heating is reflection-driven turbulence (RDT), in which gradients in the background Alfvén speed partially reflect outward-propagating Alfvén waves, seeding counter-propagating fluctuations that interact and dissipate via turbulence. Previous RDT models assume a radial background magnetic field, but at larger radii the interplanetary field is known to be twisted into the Parker Spiral (PS). Here, we generalize RDT phenomenology to include a PS, using three-dimensional expanding-box magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to test the ideas and compare the resulting turbulence to the radial-background-field case. We argue that the underlying RDT dynamics remain broadly similar with a PS, but the controlling scales change: as the azimuthal field grows it \"cuts across\" perpendicularly stretched, pancake-like eddies, producing outer scales perpendicular to the magnetic field that are much smaller than in the radial-background case. Consequently, the outer-scale nonlinear turnover time increases more slowly with heliocentric distance in PS geometry, weakening the tendency (seen in radial-background models) for the cascade to 'freeze' into quasi-static, magnetically dominated structures. This allows the system to dissipate a larger fraction of the fluctuation energy as heat, also implying that the turbulence remains strongly imbalanced (with high normalized cross-helicity) out to larger heliocentric distances. We complement our heating results with a detailed characterization of the turbulence (e.g., spectra, switchbacks, and compressive fractions) providing a set of concrete predictions for comparison with spacecraft observations.",

In this paper, we present a detailed study on the filament initial eruption under a fan-spine structure. It was found that the filament underwent two distinct acceleration stages corresponding to a calss M1.0 and M4.6 flare event, respectively. The first acceleration stage commenced with the filament splitting, after which the upper portion was subsequently heated being a hot channel and slow rose at an average speed of 22 km/s. A set of hot reverse C-shaped loops appeared repeatedly during the filament splitting and a hook structure was recognized at this phase, suggesting ongoing growth of the magnetic flux rope (MFR). When it reached a certain altitude, the hot channel appeared to get into a quasi-static phase with its upper edge seriously decelerated and lower edge expanding downward. Approximately 30 minutes later, as a distinct annular ribbon appeared outside the hook structure, the hot channel rose again at a velocity over 50 km/s accompanied with rapid footpoints drifting, and experienced the second acceleration stage with its axial flux increased to 1.1 X 10^{21} Mx. It is deduced that the filament initial eruption under a magnetic dome possess multi kinetic process. We suggest that the magnetic reconnection taken place within and beneath the filament continues to trigger the growth of pre-eruptive MFR and the first acceleration, when the magnetic reconnection above the filament plays a key role in the second acceleration.",

We utilize high-resolution H$\\alpha$ images acquired from the 1.6-meter Goode Solar Telescope (GST) at Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) to investigate spatial and the dynamical properties of both spicules and network bright points (NBPs) and, for the first time, incorporated NBP motions in the analyses of spicules. Our main results are as follows: (1) The speed distributions of blueshifted spicules and NBPs both exhibit distinct peaks, whereas that of redshifted spicules is monotonically decreasing. (2) Torsional motions of spicules inferred from alternating signs of Dopplershifts are faster than the NBPs' transversal motions by a factor of $10-10^2$, which may imply the mass density ratio in two different heights as $10^2-10^4$. (3) Blueshifted spicules are found to be more abundant than redshifted spicules in general, but their relative population difference reduces to ~10% at Doppler speeds above 35 km s$^{-1}$. (4) Redshifted spicules lying at higher heights share morphological and dynamical similarity with the blueshifted spicules, which implies the same driving mechanism operating in both directions. (5) These two populations appear above NBPs concentrated under the AIA 193 A bright region. We interpret these results in favor of a scenario that Alfven waves generated by NBPs motions impart their energies to spicules in both torsional and field-aligned motions, and also contribute to the coronal heating and possibly the acceleration of the solar wind.",

Tatarnikov Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We report the discovery of TOI-7019b, the first transiting brown dwarf (BD) known to orbit a star that is part of the Milky Way's ancient thick disk, as defined chemically ([Fe/H] $= -0.79 \\pm 0.05$ dex, [$\\alpha$/Fe] $= +0.26 \\pm 0.05$ dex, [M/H] $= -0.59 \\pm 0.06$ dex) and kinematically ($v_{\\perp} \\approx 150 \\pm 1$ km s$^{-1}$). We estimate a system age $\\tau = 12 \\pm 2$ Gyr by fitting the host star's spectrum and spectral energy distribution to alpha-enhanced isochrones, and independently using the age-metallicity relation of the thick disk. This makes TOI-7019 by far the most metal-poor and ancient BD host known to date. We measure a BD mass of $61.3 \\pm 2.1$ $M_{\\rm J}$ and radius of $0.82 \\pm 0.02$ $R_{\\rm J}$ from a joint analysis of transit photometry and radial velocity measurements, along with an orbital period of $48.2592 \\pm 0.0001$ days and an orbital eccentricity of $0.403 \\pm 0.002$. The measured radius appears $12.3\\% \\pm 2.8\\%$ larger than predicted relative to standard evolutionary models for old, metal-poor brown dwarfs, hinting at missing physics like the magnetic inhibition of convection. TOI-7019b lowers the probed metallicity regime for transiting BDs by over a factor of two, making it a benchmark system to test evolutionary models in the low-metallicity regime. Future measurements of TOI-7019b's atmosphere will test whether a brown dwarf's atmospheric composition tracks its host star's abundances, as expected for binary-like co-formation.",

In this paper, we describe how we have combined a method for modelling the coagulation of a population of dust grains with the MULTIGRAIN algorithm for modelling the dynamical evolution of a population of dust grains that are subject to strong gas drag. We solve the dynamical evolution of the dust grains due to gas drag using a recently-developed implicit integration method, and we introduce a new implicit method to model the diffusion of the dust due to unresolved hydrodynamic turbulence. The resulting smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code allows us, for the first time, to model the growth, mixing and migration of dust grain populations during the early stages of star formation and the formation, growth and evolution of a young protoplanetary disc using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. In doing so, we find that including turbulent dust diffusion within the disc provides a substantial enhancement of the rate of dust grain growth due to the fact that the turbulent diffusion provides a source of small and intermediate dust grains to the regions in which the largest dust grains are growing.",

The water vapor emission peaks at the inner edge of the warm dust cavity, located ~15 au from the central star. We attribute this to thermal desorption at the water snowline, shifted outward at the dust cavity wall directly heated by the intense radiation. This represents the first spatially resolved image of the water snowline using ALMA observations of the main water isotopologue in a protoplanetary disk. The water emission morphology peaking inside the first dust ring is consistent with previous ALMA detections of oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules in the disk, including thermally desorbed methanol. These findings signal that warm cavities of transition disks provide ideal targets to directly reconstruct the spatial distribution of water vapor and the snowline location with ALMA, and directly connect water vapor emission to ice desorption of complex organic species.",

Activity-induced changes in the chromatic apparent stellar radius represent a major challenge for atmospheric characterisation. As surface distributions of magnetic features are generally unknown for stars other than the Sun, we adopt the Sun as a benchmark to study how the chromatic effect depends on the distribution of spots and faculae. Using spot and facular masks derived from SDO/HMI magnetograms and intensitygrams, combined with the SATIRE model, we compute the chromatic dependence of the Sun's apparent radius. We test different methods of convolving surface coverage with spectra the identify physical drivers of the effect. We find that simplified approaches, which neglect the CLV, underestimate the apparent radius, particularly for faculae, whose surface coverage dominates at near-solar activity levels. Proper treatment of facular CLV is therefore essential. The activity-induced variation between solar minimum and maximum reaches around 40 ppm for a Jupiter-like transit, exceeding JWST's expected 10 ppm noise floor, while remaining at around 0.4 ppm for an Earth-like transit.",

Significant progress has been achieved, from enlarging the sample size to broadening the studies to encompass diverse stellar types and ages. Here, we present a transmission spectroscopy study of HAT-P-70b, an UHJ orbiting a young A-type star, through high-resolution observations with CARMENES at the 3.5m Calar Alto telescope. By using the line-by-line technique, we confirm the previous detections of Ha, Na I, and Ca II, report a new tentative detection of K I, and impose an upper limit on the He triplet absorption. Through cross-correlation analysis, we identify the Ca II and Fe I absorptions, both blue-shifted by approximately 5 km/s, indicating a day-to-night side atmospheric wind. Additionally, we find a new tentative detection of K I. We do not see any significant atmospheric molecular signal in the near-infrared data. Putting HAT-P-70b in the context of UHJs from the literature, it turns out that (1) Ha absorption is more common on gas giants orbiting stars younger than 1 Gyr, with a relative detection probability of $P_{\\rm Age<1\\,Gyr}({\\rm Ha})/P_{\\rm Age\\geq1\\,Gyr}({\\rm Ha})\\sim 3$; (2) any UHJ is likely to exhibit Fe I absorption if it has Ca II.",

Wijdeveld Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics. 19 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Post-RGB and post-AGB binaries consist of a primary star that has recently evolved off either the RGB or AGB after losing most of its envelope, and a main-sequence companion. They are distinguished by luminosities below and above the RGB tip, respectively. These systems host a stable, dusty circumbinary disc, characterised by a near-infrared excess. Observed Galactic post-AGB and post-RGB binaries have orbital periods and eccentricities inconsistent with binary population synthesis models. Here, we focus on post-RGB binaries, testing whether stable mass transfer can explain their orbital periods by comparing models with the known sample of 38 Galactic post-RGB binaries. We systematically determined luminosities of Galactic post-RGB and post-AGB binaries through SED fitting. We computed evolution models for low- and intermediate-mass binaries with RGB donors at two metallicities using MESA. We selected stable mass transfer models producing primaries with effective temperatures within the observed range. From these models, we find that low-mass post-RGB binaries should follow strict luminosity-orbital period relations. The Galactic post-RGB binaries seem consistent with these relations if their orbits remained eccentric during mass transfer and if the donor filled its Roche lobe at periastron. However, our models are unable to explain the eccentricities themselves. Moreover, post-mass-transfer ages from our models are much longer than predicted dissipation timescales of circumbinary discs. Stable mass transfer seems to explain the orbital periods of Galactic post-RGB binaries. This formation channel can be tested further by obtaining orbits of additional Galactic systems and Magellanic Cloud candidates via long-term radial velocity monitoring. Gaia DR 4 will improve luminosities of Galactic post-RGB binaries, enabling more accurate comparison with luminosity-orbital period relations.",

      "abstract": "Combining spectral analysis and narrow band pass filtering to predict solar cycle parameters in the next solar grand minimum Ian Edmonds, Peter Killen Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We introduce a new method for predicting sunspot number (SSN) that, based on successful back projections, can predict features of the SSN several solar cycles in advance. The method applies Fourier analysis to the annual SILSO SSN record, from 1700.5 to 2023.5, to identify in the spectrum, four strong components in the decadal, 10 to 11 year period, range and four weaker components in the octal, 8 to 9 year period, range. The time variation of each component is isolated by a new method of narrow band pass filtering. The components are fitted with sinusoids at the beginning/end of the SSN record for back/forward projection. Back projection successfully replicated the long term features of the Maunder Minimum. Forward projection predicts a Maunder-like grand minimum from 2030 to 2110, encompassing solar cycles 26 to 35. Details of short term features of SSN within the grand minimum are less certain. The octal contribution to SSN is shown to occasionally exceed the decadal contribution both in the projection and also within the observational record. Predicted SSN amplitudes for cycles 26 and 28 are about 50, about half the amplitude of cycles 24 and 25. The amplitude of cycle 27 is difficult to forecast as it may emerge as a double peak of cycle 26 rather than as two separate cycles 26 and 27. Amplitudes forecast for cycles 29 to 33 are, on average, about half the amplitude of cycles 26 and 27 with the lowest cycle of the grand minimum, cycle 30, occurring around 2070. Interference between the octal and decadal components evident in the SSN spectrum are shown to result in micro changes in SSN such as the Waldmeier Effect. Inter group results in the occurrence of grand solar minima and maxima. Intra component group interference results in long term variation grand maxima/minima patterns that may relate to the occurrence of long term climate variability.",

Using high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise ratio spectra from the ESO and Keck archives, we perform a strict line-by-line differential analysis relative to the Sun to derive stellar parameters and abundances of 19 elements from C to Zn. The stars span effective temperatures of 4500-6500 K and metallicities from -0.57 to +0.50 dex. The sample includes hosts of both gas giants and terrestrial planets, allowing direct comparison between stellar composition and planetary properties. Several of the giant planets orbit metal-rich stars. The detailed abundance patterns show clear chemical diversity, including carbon-enhanced but mildly metal-poor stars (TOI-824, TOI-1130, GJ 9827) and $\\alpha$-enhanced metal-poor stars (TOI-561, GJ 9827, TOI-824). These variations trace differences in protoplanetary disk composition and may influence planetary interiors and atmospheric chemistry. The planet-hosts show a range of [C/O] ratios, and the diverse [Mg/Si] ratios may suggest varied interior compositions for their rocky planets. This homogeneous stellar abundance, together with future uniform JWST planetary atmosphere measurements, provides a foundation for exploring the planet mass-metallicity relation and the connection between stellar chemistry and planetary formation pathways. These results constitute the first step in a larger survey spanning multiple JWST cycles to systematically examine how host star composition shapes exoplanetary systems.",

In radio astronomy, Fast Imaging Pipeline (FIP) addresses this need by reconstructing radio astronomical images and identifying candidates statistically. The FIP comprises imaging and localisation components but conventional radio astronomical imagers, optimised for longer integrations, limit its efficiency. To overcome this limitation, a Transient-Oriented Imager (TOI) is developed based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and parallelised on NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA. Integrating the TOI with an advanced transient detector, FITrig, forms the FIP-TOI enabling real-time and high-precision localisation of pulsar candidates. For 4K x 4K-pixel images, FIP-TOI accelerates localisation by roughly tenfold compared to a pipeline using the standard imager WSClean. Testing on diverse datasets -- including fields with multiple pulsars, an on-and-off pulsar, and a pulsar exhibiting intensity changes -- FIP-TOI demonstrates robust performance across all scenarios.",

The system employs an efficient multi-stage processing architecture: initial beamforming is executed on the Xilinx ZCU216 RF System-on-Chip (RFSoC) platform; data is then transferred to Intel Xeon servers, where AVX-512 and AMX instruction sets are utilized for the second stage of beamforming and channelization, achieving high computational efficiency to ensure real-time capability. A highly optimized \\texttt{bonsai} de-dispersion algorithm performs a real-time pulse search and triggering across 256 beams, which, upon detection, issues commands to the distributed outrigger system to save voltage data for very-long baseline interferometry (VLBI) precise localization.

Venville Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We search data from the GLEAM-X survey, obtained with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) in 2020, for the presence of radio frequency interference from distant Earth-orbiting satellites, in the form of unintended emissions similar to those recently seen from objects in Low Earth Orbits (LEO). Using the GLEAM-X Dec = 1.6 degree pointing, which is stationary in azimuth (on the local Meridian) and elevation (near the celestial Equator), the very wide field of view of the MWA maintains custody of a large number of satellites in geostationary and geosynchronous (GEO) orbits in this direction for long periods of time. We use one night of GLEAM-X data in the 72 - 231 MHz frequency range to form stacked images at the predicted coordinates of up to 162 such satellites, in order to search for unintended radio emission. In the majority of cases, we reach 4 sigma upper limits of better than 1 mW Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) in a 30.72 MHz bandwidth (dual polarisation), with the best limits below 10 uW. No convincing evidence for unintended emissions at these detection thresholds was found. This study builds on recent work showing an increasing prevalence of unintended emissions from satellites in LEO. Any such emission from objects in GEO could be a significant contributor to radio frequency interference experienced by the low frequency Square Kilometre Array and warrants monitoring. The current study forms a baseline for comparisons to future monitoring.",

The code repository for ExoNAMD is at this https URL Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Multiplanetary systems are excellent laboratories for studying the formation and evolution of exoplanets inside the same stellar environment. The number of known multiplanetary systems is expected to skyrocket with the advent of PLATO and the Roman space telescope. The spin-orbit angle is a key context information for the systems' dynamical history, and in recent years a growing number of planets had their spin-orbit angle measured, revealing a large diversity in orbital configurations, from well-aligned to polar, and even retrograde, orbits. Still, observers lack a robust tool to compare the dynamical state of different systems and to select the most suitable ones for future avenues of exploration, such as investigating the evolutionary pathways and their links to the atmospheric composition. Here, we present ExoNAMD, an open source code aimed at evaluating the dynamical state of multiplanetary systems via the Normalized Angular Momentum Deficit (NAMD) metric. The NAMD measures the deficit in angular momentum with respect to circular, co-planar orbits. It is normalized to compare systems with different architectures and provides a lower limit on the past dynamical excitation of the system. We find that using the spin-orbit angle parameter in the NAMD calculation (A-NAMD) improves the dynamical state's description, compared to using only the relative inclinations (R-NAMD). Comparison of A-NAMD and R-NAMD also yields powerful insights into the interplay between eccentricity and spin-orbit angle. ExoNAMD is a timely tool for easy and fast comparison of the myriad of exoplanetary systems to be discovered by PLATO and Roman, and to optimize the target selection and scientific output for future atmospheric characterization using ELTs, JWST, and Ariel.",

Here, we present XODIAC, a fast, GPU-accelerated, one-dimensional photochemical model with a built-in equilibrium chemistry solver, an updated thermochemical database, and three chemical reaction networks. This framework enables comparative atmospheric chemistry studies, including the newly developed XODIAC-2025 network, a state-of-the-art C-H-O-N-P-S-Metals network, linking 594 species through 7,720 reactions. The other two are existing, publicly available C-H-O-N-S and C-H-O-N-S-Metals networks, from the established photochemical models VULCAN and ARGO, respectively, which are commonly used in the community. The XODIAC model has been rigorously benchmarked on the well-studied hot Jupiter HD 189733 b, with results compared against these two models. Benchmarking shows excellent agreement and demonstrates that, when the same chemical network and initial conditions are used, the numerical scheme for solving atmospheric chemistry does not significantly affect the results. We also revisited the atmospheric chemistry of HD 189733 b and performed a comparative analysis across the three networks. Sulfur chemistry shows the least variation across networks, carbon chemistry shows slightly more, and phosphorus chemistry varies the most, primarily due to the introduction of unique PHO and PN pathways comprising 390 reactions in the XODIAC-2025 network. These findings highlight XODIAC's capability to advance exoplanetary atmospheric chemistry and provide a robust framework for comparative exoplanetology.",

Lapi 14 pages, 10 figures (see also arXiv:2410.06261). Updated to match published version Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Future space observatories that seek to perform imaging and spectroscopy of faint astronomical sources will require ultra-low-noise detectors that are sensitive over a broad wavelength range. Silicon charge-coupled devices (CCDs), such as EMCCDs, skipper CCDs, multi-amplifier sensing (MAS) CCDs, and single-electron sensitive read out (SiSeRO) CCDs have demonstrated the ability to detect and measure single photons from X-ray energies to near the silicon band gap (~1.1 $\\mu$m), making them candidate technologies for this application. In this context, we study a relatively unexplored source of low-energy background coming from Cherenkov radiation produced by energetic cosmic rays traversing a silicon detector. We present a model for Cherenkov photon production and absorption that is calibrated to laboratory data, and we use this model to characterize the residual background rate for ultra-low-noise silicon detectors in space. We study how the Cherenkov background rate depends on detector thickness, variations in solar activity, and the contribution of heavy cosmic ray species (Z > 2). We find that for thick silicon detectors, such as those required to achieve high quantum efficiency at long wavelengths, the rate of cosmic-ray-induced Cherenkov photon production is comparable to other detector and astrophysical backgrounds. We apply our Cherenkov background model to simulated spectroscopic observations of extra-solar planets, and we find that thick detectors continue to outperform their thinner counterparts at longer wavelengths despite a larger Cherenkov background rate. Furthermore, we find that minimal masking of cosmic-ray tracks continues to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of very faint sources despite the existence of extended halos of Cherenkov photons.",

In this work, we attempt a different approach and try to improve the efficiency of these algorithms by fitting only derived planetary parameters, instead of full time-series light curves. We investigate and evaluate 4 models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Convolutional Neural Networks) on the KEPLER dataset, using precision-recall trade-off and accuracy metrics. We show that this approach can identify up to about 90% of false positives, implying the planetary parameters encompass most of the relevant information contained in a light curve.

We present a new method that allows simultaneous measurement of the size and velocity of the largest high-velocity ejecta. High-speed camera images revealed the time required for the ejecta to reach the secondary target, and ejecta size was determined after the experiment by analyzing the craters formed upon their impact on the secondary target. We defined the size-velocity relationships of sub-millimeter ejecta with velocities exceeding 1 km s$^{-1}$, focusing on the largest detectable ejecta in our experiments. The results show that millimeter-sized meteoroids impacting the rocky surfaces of planetary bodies at 7 km s$^{-1}$ eject particles up to a few tens of micrometers in size toward interplanetary space at velocities exceeding the escape velocity of the body, even when it is greater than 1 km s$^{-1}$.",

Facilities like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will significantly advance the feasibility of characterizing the atmospheres of habitable exoplanets at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, while other future mission concepts could extend this search to mid-infrared wavelengths. We draw upon a recently developed set of 10 self-consistent scenarios for future Earth technospheres as analogs for extraterrestrial technospheres, which we use to outline a stepwise technosignature search strategy, beginning with HWO and followed by other missions. We find that HWO could reveal elevated abundances of a CO$_2$ + NO$_2$ pair on planets with combustion and other large-scale industry, which could be observable in up to eight of the 10 scenarios. Follow-up radio observations could reveal narrowband directed transmissions, as occur in two of the scenarios. Further study involving direct detections at mid-infrared wavelengths with the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets could reveal spectral features from industry, such as the combinations of CO$_2$ + CFC-11/12 in four scenarios and CO$_2$ + CFC-11/12 + CF$_4$ in one scenario; two of these also include the N$_2$O + CH$_4$ + NH$_3$ triple from large-scale agriculture. Other mission concepts, such as a solar-gravitational-lens mission, could reveal large-scale surface features in two scenarios that would otherwise show no detectable technosignatures, while an interplanetary flyby or probe mission would be the most conclusive way to reveal the presence of technology on terrestrial exoplanets.",

Poludnenko Version fixes incorrect math symbols/fonts in prior version Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) While direct numerical simulations (DNS) are the most accurate method for studying turbulence, their large computational cost restricts their use to idealized configurations and to Reynolds numbers well below those found in practical systems. A recently proposed method, Large/Small Eddy Simulation (L/SES), aims to overcome this limitation while still providing the solution fidelity comparable to that of DNS. L/SES represents a pair of coupled calculations: a lower-fidelity Large Eddy Simulation (LES), which captures the large-scale flow structure, and a high-fidelity Small-Eddy Simulation (SES) targeting a sub-region of interest of the LES, in which the small-scale dynamics is fully resolved. In this study, we demonstrate the accuracy and performance of L/SES in large Reynolds-number homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) up to Taylor-scale Reynolds number approximately 600. Turbulence properties obtained with L/SES are shown to be in close agreement with the literature, both in terms of global characteristics, such as kinetic energy spectra and dissipative anomaly, as well as small-scale properties, such as higher-order moments of the velocity gradients up to the 10th order and probability density functions of the intermittent quantities. Also using simulations of HIT, we systematically investigate various method parameters and determine their optimal converged values. Finally, we discuss the computational cost of L/SES and demonstrate that it is approximately 3 orders of magnitude lower than for a traditional DNS at the highest Reynolds number considered here. This highlights the potential of L/SES as a discovery tool, which brings high-fidelity simulations of realistic flows into the realm of feasibility.",

Boyle Accepted for publication into AJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The discovery of young (<800 Myr) transiting planets has provided a new avenue to explore how planets form and evolve over their lifetimes. Mass measurements for these planets would be invaluable, but radial velocity surveys of young systems are often overwhelmed by stellar activity. Transit timing variations (TTVs) offer an alternative route to measure masses that are less impacted by signals from the host star. Here we search for candidate TTVs in a sample of 39 young systems hosting 53 transiting planets using data from Kepler, K2, and TESS. We recover previously reported TTVs for 11 planets, including those in V1298 Tau, TOI-2076, Kepler-51, and TOI-1227, and identify new candidate TTVs for four planets (DS Tuc Ab, HD 63433b, K2-101b, and Kepler-1643b). In total, 28.3 +/- 6.2% of young planets in our sample show evidence of TTVs, which is higher than the rate from Kepler on mostly older systems (7.3 +/- 0.6%). Accounting for differences in data coverage and quality between Kepler and TESS only increases this difference (> 4$\\sigma$), although differences in methodology make a totally fair comparison challenging. We show that spots have a weak-to-negligible impact on our results, and similarly cannot explain the higher TTV fraction. Longer-term monitoring will be required to validate these TTVs as planetary in nature and confirm the high TTV rate. While the candidate TTV signals detected here are sparsely sampled, our work provides a clear priority list for additional ground-based observations, and for multi-planet TTVs, attempt to measure the masses and eccentricities of these planets.",

It is also unclear whether inner rocky planets can survive in systems hosting a cold giant, with implications for the habitability of close-in worlds. We investigated the conditions that allow giant planets to form at 1-3 au around a 0.1 M$_\\odot$ star and explored when a close-in rocky planet can survive. We perform N-body simulations in which embryos grow through pebble and gas accretion in a disk with a local turbulent viscosity of $\\alpha_t = 10^{-4}$. Planet-disk interactions are included using a prescription that triggers outward migration when the planet-to-star mass ratio ($q$) exceeds 0.002. We find that a cold giant can form even in a disk with an initial pebble mass of 6 M$_\\oplus$ if the disk gas mass is 10$\\%$ of the stellar mass. This requires a compact 20 au disk with a dense inner region set by $\\alpha_g = 10^{-4}$, the assembly of a $\\sim$5 M$_\\oplus$ core within 1 Myr, and a disk lifetime of 10 Myr. A close-in rocky planet can survive if it reaches the inner cavity before the outer body becomes a giant. Thus, giant planet formation around very low-mass stars does not require high dust masses as previously thought. A combination of planet-planet collisions, efficient pebble accretion, and a long disk lifetime plays a key role in enabling the formation of cold giant planets with masses between those of Saturn and Jupiter.",

Banyal 14 pages. 11 figures, Accepted for publication in MNARS Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Stellar activity manifests differently across wavelengths, causing flux variability that can obscure planetary transits. While transit observations are typically performed in the visible and infrared bands, where stellar flux is relatively stable, short-wavelength regimes exhibit high variability, complicating reliable detections. Here, we analyze the 2012 transit of Venus as an exoplanet analog using multiwavelength observations taken by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) in five channels: 6173~Å (continuum), 1700~Å (broadband), and three extreme-UV (EUV) narrowbands at 304~Å, 171~Å, and 94~Å. We find that the disk-integrated transit signal is clearly detectable in the 6173~Å band, whereas strong solar activity-induced fluctuations obscure the transit in the EUV channels. Notably, the 1700~Å UV transit is noisier but significantly longer ($\\approx 9.2$~hrs) than the visible-band transit ($\\approx 6.7$~hrs), because Venus began occulting the extended coronal features before ingress onto the visible disk. This observation highlights the potential of UV transits to probe the spatial extent of stellar coronae in exoplanetary systems. Numerical simulations further suggest that limb-brightened stars in quiescence phase may exhibit distinctive UV/EUV transit signatures, opening new possibilities for exoplanet detection and characterization in these spectral regimes.",

Schwarz, Avi Shporer Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) For small planets orbiting within the habitable zones of their host stars, multicolour validation via photometric transit observations offers an efficient alternative to prioritize targets before intensive radial-velocity follow-up, thereby expanding the sample of habitable-zone exoplanets amenable for atmospheric characterisation. In this study, we validate two exceptional habitable-zone TESS candidates, orbiting around M-dwarfs, as genuine planets, precisely determining their transit and physical parameters. We perform Bayesian model comparison by jointly fitting multicolour light curves from TESS and ground-based follow-up, including observations with HiPERCAM at the 10.4-m GTC. Our approach uses wavelength-dependent transit depth variations and precise transit geometry to reject false positives. We validate TOI-2094 b and TOI-7166 b as two new benchmark temperate mini-Neptunes. TOI-2094 b (1.90 $R_{\\oplus}$) orbits its M3V star with a period of $\\sim$18.79 days, well within the habitable zone ($\\sim$0.98 Earth insolation). TOI-7166 b (2.39 $R_{\\oplus}$) orbits its M4.5V host star with a period of $\\sim$12.92 days, placing it near the inner edge of the habitable zone ($\\sim$1.93 Earth insolation). Statistical mass and density estimates suggest that TOI-2094 b may be a volatile-rich planet, such as a water world or a gaseous planet, and is less likely to be rocky, while TOI-7166 b is likely to be volatile-rich. Both planets are of great interest for detailed atmospheric characterisation with the JWST and future ELTs, which requires further precise mass measurements.",

Published in MNRAS Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 2025, Volume 544, Issue 2, pp. 2637-2652, 16 pp Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We present the discovery and validation of TOI-7166b, a 2.01+/-0.05R_Earth planet orbiting a nearby low-mass star. We validated the planet by combining TESS and multi-color high-precision photometric observations from ground-based telescopes, together with spectroscopic data, high-contrast imaging, archival images, and statistical arguments. The host star is an M4-type dwarf at a distance of ~35 pc from the Sun. It has a mass and a radius of Ms=0.190+/-0.004M_Sun and Rs=0.222+/-0.005R_Sun, respectively. TOI-7166b has an orbital period of 12.9 days, which places it close to the inner edge of the Habitable Zone of its host star, receiving an insolation flux of Sp=1.07+/-0.08S_Earth and an equilibrium temperature of Teq=249+/-5K (assuming a null Bond albedo). The brightness of the host star makes TOI-7166 a suitable target for radial velocity follow-up to measure the planetary mass and bulk density. Moreover, the physical parameters of the system including the infrared brightness (Kmag = 10.6) of the star and the planet-to-star radius ratio (0.0823+/-0.0012) make TOI-7166b an exquisite target for transmission spectroscopic observations with the JWST, to constrain the exoplanet atmospheric compositions.",

Kobayashi, P. Scicluna, S. T. Zeegers 14 pages, 9 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in MNRAS Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Determination of the composition and size distribution of dust grains in debris discs is strongly dependent on constraining the underlying spatial distribution of that dust through multi-wavelength, spatially resolved imaging spanning near-infrared to millimetre wavelengths. To date, spatially resolved imaging exists for well over a hundred debris disc systems. Simple analytical radiative transfer models of debris dust emission can reveal trends in disc properties as a function of their host stars' luminosities. Here we present such an analysis for 133 debris discs, calculating the dust grain minimum sizes ($s_{\\rm min}$), dust masses ($M_{\\rm dust}$), and exponents of the size distribution ($q$) in conjunction with their architectures determined at far-infrared or millimetre wavelengths. The distribution of $q$ at far-infrared to millimetre wavelengths is characterised for the first time, finding a value of $3.49^{+0.38}_{-0.33}$. We further newly identify a trend between $q$ and $R_{\\rm disc}$, which may be indicative of velocity dependent fragmentation, or grain growth at large radii. We find the disc masses inferred from this analysis are consistent with those of protoplanetary discs. Finally, we identify samples of debris discs suitable for further characterisation at millimetre and centimetre wavelengths, expanding the number of spatially resolved systems upon which future studies of these statistics can be based.",

By quantifying the detectability as a function of normalized exposure time, resolving power (R), and amount of spectral points, we can constrain whether spectroscopy or photometry is the more efficient observing procedure to detect H2O at varying abundances by measuring the broad 0.94 microns absorption feature using the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). We simulate low-resolution spectroscopy (R = 10, 20, 30, presented as photometric bandwidth fraction 10%, 5%, 3% herein) as a proxy for narrow-band photometric observations, and constrain the wavelength range from 0.85 - 1.05 microns, to narrow focus on the 0.9 microns feature. We then constrain the number of spectral points to 2 or 3 points at each bandwidth fraction to investigate the impact of spectral point placement on detectability. Additionally, we take the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for strong H2O detection and calculate the resultant exoplanet yields assuming photometric observation and compare to the yields from higher-resolution spectroscopic observations under different noise instances, characterization wavelength, noise floors, and aperture sizes. We find that H2O is strongly detectable at all bandwidth fractions depending on the spectral point placement, requiring a minimum of 3 spectral points, at a variety of normalized exposure time depending on the abundance of H2O. We also find that the detector noise is the main driver in determining whether photometry or spectroscopy results in higher yields. Photometry is the preferred observational method in high-noise cases, while spectroscopy is preferred in low-noise scenarios.",

Wakeford 26 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication in AJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) One of the forefront goals in the field of exoplanets is the detection of an atmosphere on a temperate terrestrial exoplanet, and among the best suited systems to do so is TRAPPIST-1. However, JWST transit observations of the TRAPPIST-1 planets show significant contamination from stellar surface features that we are unable to confidently model. Here, we present the motivation and first observations of our JWST multi-cycle program of TRAPPIST-1 e, which utilize close transits of the airless TRAPPIST-1 b to model-independently correct for stellar contamination, with the goal of determining whether TRAPPIST-1 e has an Earth-like mean molecular weight atmosphere containing CO$_2$. We present our simulations, which show that with the 15 close transit observations, we will be able to detect this atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1 e at $\\Delta\\ln\\,Z=5$ or greater confidence assuming we are able to correct for stellar contamination using the close transit observations. We also show the first three observations of our program. We find that our ability to correct for stellar contamination can be inhibited when strong stellar flares are present, as flares can break the assumption that the star does not change meaningfully between planetary transits. The cleanest observation demonstrates the removal of stellar contamination contribution through an increased preference for a flat line over the original TRAPPIST-1 e spectrum, but highlights how minor data analysis assumptions can propagate significantly when searching for small atmospheric signals. This is amplified when using the signals from multiple planets, which is important to consider as we continue our atmospheric search.",

On longer orbits, planets are less affected by their host star, and become ideal probes of planet formation, migration and evolution. We report the discovery of a long period Neptune and two Saturns, each initially identified as single transits in the TESS photometry, and solved through additional transits from ground-based follow-up photometric observations by NGTS and ASTEP. High-resolution radial velocity mass measurements using CORALIE and HARPS confirm their planetary nature. From joint modelling of the photometric and spectroscopic data, we determine an orbital period of $43.12655_{-0.00017}^{+0.00012}~$days, radius of $3.65\\pm0.22~\\mathrm{R_{\\oplus}}$, and mass of $19.1_{-4.5}^{+4.9}~\\mathrm{M_{\\oplus}}$ for NGTS-34b, making it one of the longest period well-characterized transiting Neptunes. Orbiting a late F-type star, bright in the K-band (Kmag$~\\simeq7.9$), it is amenable for cool atmosphere studies using JWST or Ariel. TOI-4940b is a small Saturn on a $25.867811_{-0.000056}^{+0.000058}~$day orbit with a radius of $6.61\\pm0.37~\\mathrm{R_{\\oplus}}$ and an upper mass limit $<89~\\mathrm{M_{\\oplus}}$. NGTS-35b(=TOI-6669b) is a larger Saturn on a $25.241192\\pm0.000022~$day, moderately eccentric orbit ($e = 0.192_{-0.033}^{+0.037}$), with a radius of $10.90\\pm0.65~\\mathrm{R_{\\oplus}}$ and a mass of $152_{-19}^{+22}~\\mathrm{M_{\\oplus}}$. With an assumed albedo $A=0.3$, each of these planets has an equilibrium temperature below 700K, with NGTS-35b especially cold at $450~$K. These three giants add to the small but growing population of long period planets that can further our understanding of planet formation mechanisms.",
