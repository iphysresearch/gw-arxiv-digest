      "abstract": "Radiating solutions in Entangled Relativity Olivier Minazzoli, Maxime Wavasseur General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The Mineur--Vaidya radiating solutions satisfy $\\mathcal{L}_m ~\\propto~ F^2 = 0 = R$. As a consequence, it is not only a solution in General Relativity, but also in Einstein--Maxwell--dilaton theories for all coupling constants. The specific case of Entangled Relativity is noteworthy because the additional scalar degree of freedom is defined from the ratio between $R$ and $\\mathcal{L}_m$, which is ill-defined in this situation. In the present work, we embed the Mineur--Vaidya solution in a magnetic (or electric) field within the framework of Entangled Relativity, and show that the Mineur--Vaidya solution corresponds to the limit where the magnetic (respectively, electric) field vanishes. This notably allows us to demonstrate that, as in General Relativity, it is possible to dynamically form naked singularities in Entangled Relativity. This conclusion, in fact, applies to any Einstein--Maxwell--dilaton theory, although it does not seem to be widely acknowledged in the literature.",

Landim General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this work, we obtain analytical solutions for a $(3+1)$-dimensional black string and a BTZ black hole, both sourced by the Dekel-Zhao dark matter (DM) density profile. Our results indicate that the event horizon radius is sensitive to the inner slope parameter $a$; specifically, beyond a critical threshold, the horizon vanishes, leading to the formation of naked singularities. We find that the DM environment induces curvature singularities in the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars, which are absent in the vacuum BTZ case. Furthermore, an analysis of the effective energy-momentum tensor shows that while the null, weak, and strong energy conditions are strictly satisfied, the dominant energy condition is violated in the BTZ scenario due to the high tangential pressure gradient. We also observe that DM modifies the Hawking temperature and free energy without compromising local or global stability. Notably, the DM distribution transforms the originally constant-curvature BTZ spacetime into a singular one, suggesting that a inherent stiffness of the DM profile is a determinant factor in the causal structure of these solutions.",

Our procedure -- which extends the work of Murata-Reall-Tanahashi to include charged scalar dynamics -- involves the fine-tuned scattering of wave packets within an initially super-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime. The resulting extremal solution develops an event horizon along which the energy density diverges and the charge density approaches a constant (i.e., the horizon forms with \"hair\"). We investigate this behavior from the perspective of critical phenomena in gravitational collapse, giving evidence that dynamical extremal black holes act as universal threshold solutions modulo this family-dependent hair. As in the linear instability of fixed extremal backgrounds, the scalar field decays outside the dynamical extremal horizon. But just inside the horizon, the scalar curvature appears to develop unbounded growth. This implies that near-threshold solutions without a black hole could develop correspondingly large curvatures visible from future null infinity.",

      "abstract": "Dynamical systems approach to stellar modelling in $f(G, B)$ gravity Sudan Hansraj, Christian Boehmer, Ndumiso Buthelezi General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The novel proposal to invoke the split of the Ricci scalar into bulk and boundary terms in the gravitational action, opens up a new avenue of investigation into stellar dynamics. The Lagrangian contains functional forms of the bulk while the boundary terms do not contribute to the dynamics. The advantage of the proposition is that the stellar structure equations are up to order two thus the theory is not haunted by ghosts. We obtain explicitly the defining equations for the thermodynamical variables and the geometry for the pure quadratic case since the linear case amounts to general relativity. In trying to establish the vacuum geometry associated with the theory it turns out that two possible metrics emerge through the vanishing of the energy-momentum tensor. Next we analyse the isotropy equation and make the observation that it is autonomous. It is rare that this happens in astrophysical modelling. This behaviour prompted the use of dynamical systems to understand the stability properties of fixed points or fixed manifolds. It was necessary to choose a gauge in order to split the autonomous equation into a system from which we could plot a phase portrait and deduce the stability of solution trajectories. We find that the fixed curves were generally stable with nearby paths approaching the fixed curves.",

Accepted by Physical Review D General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph) The uncertainty principle constitutes a fundamental pillar of quantum theory, representing one of the most distinctive features that differentiates quantum mechanics from classical physics. In this study, we firstly propose a novel generalized entropic uncertainty relation (EUR) for arbitrary multi-measurement in the many-body systems, and rigorously derive a significantly tighter bound compared to existing formulations. Specifically, we discuss the proposed EUR in the context of Schwarzschild black hole, where we demonstrate the superior tightness of our derived bound. The study further elucidates the dynamical evolution of multipartite quantum coherence and entanglement in the curved spacetime. A particularly noteworthy finding reveals the exact equivalence between entanglement and $l_1$-norm coherence for arbitrary $N$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-type (GHZ-type) states. Moreover, we find that quantum coherence is significantly diminished and the measurement uncertainty increases to a stable maximum with increasing Hawking temperature. Thus, the findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of non-classicality and quantum resources in black holes.",

Ali, Meng-He Wu, Hong Guo, Xiao-Mei Kuang General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) as a diagnostic tool for probing frame-dragging effects and accretion disk physics in the spacetime of a rotating regular magnetic black hole (BH). Specifically, we analyze the precession of bound orbits and the epicyclic oscillations of test particles under small perturbations in the equatorial plane. We demonstrate how the BH nonminimal coupling parameter (lambda/M^4) and dimensionless magnetic charge (Q/M) significantly influence the three fundamental epicyclic frequencies. By applying the relativistic precession model and employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations (MCMC), we constrain the BH characteristic parameters, including mass, spin, magnetic charge, and nonminimal coupling, using observational QPO data from five X-ray binaries: GRO J1655-40, XTE J1859+226, H1743-322, XTE J1550-564, and GRS 1915+105. Furthermore, we examine the Lense-Thirring, geodetic, and general spin precession frequencies of a test gyroscope attached to a stationary observer around the black hole. Our theoretical results indicate that the regular charged black hole suppresses these precession frequencies compared with the Kerr black hole case.",

In this work, we investigate the entanglement properties of the four-qubit cluster state ($CL_4$) for fermionic fields in the curved spacetime of a Schwarzschild black hole. Remarkably, we uncover a counterintuitive phenomenon: as the Hawking temperature increases, quantum entanglement ($1$-$3$ tangle) of the $CL_4$ state remains strictly constant, indicating a ``complete freezing of initially maximal entanglement\". This constitutes the first explicit example in which maximal entanglement remains perfectly preserved in a black hole environment, defying the conventional expectation that gravitational effects can only suppress maximal quantum correlations. Moreover, our results indicate that, within a relativistic framework, the $CL_4$ state constitutes a high-quality quantum resource with potential applications in relativistic quantum information processing, and may significantly improve the performance of such protocols.",

Here we develop two new methods to numerically obtain the $\\textit{exact parameters}$ by means of usual Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff computation, and find that the difference with the value of standard post-Newtonian parameters can be more than 80% in some situations. We also provide the connection with the Damour-Esposito Farèse non-pertubative parameter $\\alpha_{DEF}$. We then apply the methodology to the case of Entangled Relativity, and derive these exact parameters for the Sun and the Earth, as well as for neutron stars. We argue that current and foreseeable experiments are likely able to constrain the theory under the assumption that $\\mathcal{L}_m=-\\rho$, where $\\rho$ is the total energy density. If $\\mathcal{L}_m=T$ instead, as often advocated in the literature, then there is no deviation with respect to General Relativity and the prospects of testing Entangled Relativity become much more remote in time, as only compact objects with extreme electric or magnetic fields could lead to some deviation from General Relativity.",

Duque General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Emergent modified gravity provides a covariant framework for holonomy effects in models of loop quantum gravity with consistent black hole solutions coupled to a scalar field. Several independent studies of the Hawking thermal distribution are shown here to lead to the same final result. This internal consistency is a direct consequence of general covariance, which is analogous to the situation in classical general relativity but highly nontrivial in the context of modified canonical gravity. Holonomy corrections to the evaporation rate enter through the greybody factor, slowing down the evaporation process when the holonomy modification function decreases monotonically. Accounting for backreaction, corrected covariant semi-classical stress-energy tensors are computed in various vacuum states. Thanks to these results, the new concept of a net stress-energy tensor makes it possible to compute evaporation rates directly from energy conservation laws.",

In a nonperturbative approach to quantum gravity, beyond the picture of gravitational perturbations propagating on a flat background, it is an open question whether the gravitational field must still satisfy a bosonic statistics. By implementing the principle of general covariance through the requirement of invariance under active diffeomorphisms in loop quantum gravity, we find that the space of kinematical states of the gravitational field includes not only bosonic states, but also subspaces of fermionic and mixed statistics.",

The development of data analysis software infrastructure at the current stage is crucial. In this paper, we introduce \\texttt{pespace} which can be used for the full Bayesian parameter estimation of massive black hole binaries with detectors including LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin. The core computations are implemented using the high-performance parallel programming framework \\texttt{taichi-lang} which enables automatic differentiation and hardware acceleration across different architectures. We also reimplement the waveform models \\texttt{PhenomXAS} and \\texttt{PhenomXHM} in the separate package \\texttt{tiwave} to integrate waveform generation within the \\texttt{taichi-lang} scope, making the entire computation accelerated and differentiable. To demonstrate the functionality of the tool, we use a typical signal from a massive black hole binary to perform the full Bayesian parameter estimation with the complete likelihood function for three scenarios: including a single detector using the waveform with only the dominant mode; a single detector using the waveform including higher modes; and a detector network with higher modes included. The results demonstrate that higher modes are essential in breaking degeneracies, and coincident observations by the detector network can significantly improve the measurement of source properties. Additionally, automatic differentiation provides an accurate way to obtain the Fisher matrix without manual fine-tuning of the finite difference step size. Using a subset of extrinsic parameters, we show that the approximated posteriors obtained by the Fisher matrix agree well with those derived from Bayesian parameter estimation.",

Density profiles derived from the mass current and from the energy-momentum tensor using a distribution function yield consistent results, but both differ substantially from profiles obtained using an anisotropic fluid model based on Einstein cluster ansatz. We find that the inclusion of radial pressure significantly modifies both the orbital dynamics and the resulting gravitational wave waveforms.

We develop a unified framework to study PBH formation in dust-radiation bouncing cosmologies, focusing on the classical contracting phase so that the results are insensitive to bounce details. We compute the curvature power spectrum for an extremely small dust equation of state using a stable semi-analytical (adiabatic) method, derive the Jeans length of the two-fluid system using dynamical-system analysis and the WKB approximation, and extend the three-zone model from the single- to the two-fluid case to model local collapse. We implement two collapse criteria to obtain the curvature perturbation threshold for PBH formation and estimate PBH mass fractions for benchmark masses spanning low-mass ($10^{-17} M_{\\odot}$) to supermassive ($10^{13} M_{\\odot}$) scales. The critical curvature threshold is extremely small and nearly mass-independent over a broad range $(\\zeta_c \\sim 10^{-21}$ for $10^{-14}$ to $10^{13} M_{\\odot})$, with deviations only near dust-radiation equality. Nevertheless, the square root of the curvature power spectrum at the relevant formation times is many orders of magnitude smaller, yielding vanishingly small PBH mass fractions across the benchmark masses.

One possible approach to this problem is based on the Barrow--Tsallis entropy. This entropy accounts for both quantum gravitational effects and the nonextensive effects inherent in any long-range interaction. Using a general method we developed for finding the parameters of cosmological models, we discovered a relationship between the parameter describing the microscopic structure of quantum foam and the parameter associated with macroscopic nonextensive effects. We also used our method for finding the parameters of cosmological models to evaluate the feasibility of using fractional derivatives to describe the late evolution of the Universe. The resulting relationships are exact.

The prevailing view, developed over decades, holds that this relaxation is rapidly filtered into a linear regime, establishing linear perturbation theory as the bedrock of black hole spectroscopy and a key pillar of gravitational-wave physics. Here we unveil a distinct nonlinear regime that transcends the traditional paradigm: before the familiar linear ringdown, an intrinsically nonlinear, long-lived bottleneck can dominate the evolution. This stage is controlled by a saddle-node ghost in phase space, which traps the remnant and delays the onset of linearity by a timescale obeying a universal power-law. The ghost imprints a distinctive quiescence-burst signature on the emitted radiation: a prolonged silence followed by a violent burst and a delayed ringdown. Rooted in the bifurcation topology, it extends naturally to neutron and boson stars, echoing a topological universality shared with diverse nonlinear systems in nature. Our results expose a missing nonlinear chapter in gravitational dynamics and identify ghost-induced quiescence-burst patterns as clear targets for future observations.",

In this work, we extend this framework to incorporate general quantum channels that model effects of environment, which can become significant at the Planck scale. Specifically, we demonstrate that the transformation properties of Kraus operators, which define completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) maps, are consistent with the gauge invariance of spin networks. This enables the introduction of generalized spin network states that can be expressed in terms of the Kraus operators. Furthermore, the associated notion of an inner product is proposed, allowing for introduction of the Hilbert space. We illustrate these constructions with examples involving a Wilson loop and a dipole network.",

We further suggest that images produced by regular stars exhibit additional characteristics distinct from those of ordinary black holes, such as the possible partial or complete absence of secondary images. These phenomena may serve as favorable observational criteria for identifying regular stars in future searches.",

Lobo History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Scale invariance has received very little attention in physics. Nevertheless, it provides a natural conceptual foundation for a relational understanding of the universe, where absolute size loses meaning and only dimensionless ratios retain physical significance. We formalize this idea through the $N$-body problem, introducing a scale-invariant function--the variety, $V$--built from the square root of the center-of-mass moment of inertia and the Newtonian potential. Critical points of $V$, known as central configurations, correspond to special particle arrangements that preserve their shape under homothetic collapse or expansion. Numerical exploration of these critical points reveals that even slight deviations from the absolute minimum of $V$, which corresponds to a remarkably uniform configuration, lead to the spontaneous formation of filaments, loops, voids and other patterns reminiscent of the cosmic web. This behavior is a consequence of the intrinsic structure of shape space--the space of configurations modulo translations, rotations and dilatations--in which regions of higher variety act as attractors. Our results suggest that scale-invariant dynamics not only captures the relational nature of physical laws but also naturally generates organized patterns, offering a novel perspective on the formation of cosmic structures and on the emergence of a gravitational arrow of time from scale-invariant, relational dynamics.",

This approach introduces a new cosmological parameter, denoted by $\\sigma$, which emerges naturally from the underlying non-commutative framework. It gives rise to a source term in the background fluid continuity equation, thereby leading to an apparent type of matter creation picture through the resulting non-conservation. Remarkably, the resulting Hubble function accounts for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe without invoking any external dark energy component or cosmological constant. Instead, the parameter $\\sigma$ effectively serves as the driver of acceleration. We further examine the observational constraints on $\\sigma$ using current cosmological data, including the recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument(DESI) dataset, demonstrating its viability as an alternative explanation for late-time cosmic acceleration within a non-commutative cosmological model.",

We construct a baseline astrophysical model of compact binary mergers and extend it by incorporating a model of ultra light dark matter, which affects the orbital evolution of binaries through accretion and dynamical friction. Our analysis of the merged population of binary progenitors demonstrates that, compared to the baseline model, ULDM can significantly alter the merger statistics when its ambient density becomes larger than 104GeV/cm3. A comparison with the gravitational wave data from the GWTC-3 catalogue provides insight into potential observational signatures of the ULDM in merger events, leading to possible constraints on the existence and density of dark matter distribution in galaxies.",

Generally, without higher temporal derivatives in the metric sector, there are 3 degrees of freedom (DOFs) propagating due to the breaking of general covariance. Through a Hamiltonian constraint analysis, we examine the conditions to eliminate the scalar DOF such that only 2 DOFs, which correspond the tensorial gravitational waves in a homogeneous and isotropic background, are propagating. We find that two conditions are needed, each of which can eliminate half degree of freedom. The second condition can be further classified into two cases according to its effect on the Dirac matrix. We also apply the formal conditions to a polynomial-type Lagrangian as a concrete example, in which all the monomials are spatially covariant scalars containing two derivatives. Our results are consistent with the previous analysis based on the perturbative method.",

Extending earlier SCG formulations, we compute the general kernel function for SIGWs on a flat Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker background, focusing on polynomial-type SCG Lagrangians up to $d=3$, where $d$ denotes the total number of derivatives in each monomial. We derive explicit expressions for the kernel in the case of power-law time evolution of the coefficients, and restrict attention to the subset of SCG operators whose tensor modes propagate at the speed of light, thereby avoiding late-time divergences in the fractional energy density of SIGWs. Instead of the usual Newtonian gauge, the breaking of time reparametrization symmetry in SCG necessitates a unitary gauge analysis. We compute the energy density of SIGWs for representative parameter combinations, finding distinctive deviations from general relativity (GR), including scale-dependent modifications to both the amplitude and the spectral shape.

Pure displacement arises when the latter is turned off by requiring the momentum to vanish and when the wave parameters take, in addition, some particular values which correspond to having an integer half-wave number.

These sources will spend $\\sim 10^5$ cycles in band, and are therefore sensitive to tiny changes in the general-relativistic dynamics, potentially induced by astrophysical environments or modifications of general relativity (GR). Previous studies have shown that these effects can be highly degenerate for a single source. However, it may be possible to distinguish between them at the population level, because environmental effects should impact only a fraction of the sources, while modifications of GR would affect all. We therefore introduce a population-based hierarchical framework to disentangle the two hypotheses. Using simulated EMRI populations, we perform tests of the null vacuum-GR hypothesis and two alternative beyond-vacuum-GR hypotheses, namely migration torques (environmental effects) and time-varying $G$ (modified gravity). We find that with as few as $\\approx 20$ detected sources, our framework can statistically distinguish between these three hypotheses, and even indicate if both environmental and modified gravity effects are simultaneously present in the population. Our framework can be applied to other models of beyond-vacuum-GR effects available in the literature.",
