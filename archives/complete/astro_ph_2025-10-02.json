Saridakis Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) The ``Tensions in Cosmology'' series of conferences has been established as one of the main venues where the cosmological community collectively assesses the cracks in the concordance model and explores possible theoretical and observational remedies. The 2025 edition, held once again in Corfu, Greece, came at a crucial time: the Hubble constant $H_0$ discrepancy has now exceeded $6\\sigma$, and new high-precision data from DESI, JWST, ACT, and other facilities have made this tension more robust while opening new windows on the early and late Universe. The $S_8$ tension, though milder and survey-dependent, remains an important probe of late-time structure formation, while emerging anomalies involving dynamical dark energy and neutrino physics are gaining increasing attention as potential signs of physics beyond $\\Lambda$CDM. Here we provide a report on the meeting and an update on the state of the tensions in 2025, highlighting progress since the pioneering 2022 event.",

Using Planck 2018 CMB temperature, polarization (P18), and lensing power spectra (lensing), along with a compilation of non-CMB data including baryon acoustic oscillation, type Ia supernova, Hubble parameter, and growth rate measurements, we constrain $\\phi$CDM and $\\phi$CDM+$A_L$ models where $A_L$ is the CMB lensing consistency parameter. The scalar field parameter $\\alpha$, which governs dark energy dynamics, is more tightly constrained by non-CMB data than by CMB data alone. For the full dataset, we obtain $\\alpha = 0.055 \\pm 0.041$ in the $\\phi$CDM model and $\\alpha = 0.095 \\pm 0.056$ in the $\\phi$CDM+$A_L$ model, mildly favoring evolving dark energy over a cosmological constant by $1.3\\sigma$ and $1.7\\sigma$. The Hubble constant is $H_0=67.55_{-0.46}^{+0.53}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the $\\phi$CDM model, consistent with median statistics and some local determinations, but in tension with other local determinations. The constraints for matter density and clustering amplitude ($\\Omega_m = 0.3096 \\pm 0.0055$, $\\sigma_8 = 0.8013_{-0.0067}^{+0.0077}$) of the flat $\\phi$CDM model statistically agree with $\\Lambda$CDM model values. Allowing $A_L$ to vary reduces tensions between CMB and non-CMB data, although we find $A_L = 1.105 \\pm 0.037$, $2.8\\sigma$ higher than unity, consistent with the excess smoothing seen in Planck data. Model comparison using AIC and DIC indicates that the $\\phi$CDM model provides a fit comparable to $\\Lambda$CDM, with the $\\phi$CDM+$A_L$ slightly preferred. Overall, while the $\\Lambda$CDM model remains an excellent fit, current data leave open the possibility of mildly evolving quintessence-like dynamical dark energy.",

      "abstract": "Excursion Set Approach to Primordial Black Holes: Cloud-in-Cloud and Mass Function Revisited Ashu Kushwaha, Teruaki Suyama Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The abundance and mass function of primordial black holes (PBHs) are often estimated using the Press-Schechter (PS) formalism. In the case of halo formation, the PS formalism suffers from the miscounting of regions collapsing into halos, known as the cloud-in-cloud problem, which is usually corrected by introducing a multiplicative `fudge factor 2'. By analogy, this factor has sometimes been applied to PBH calculations, although its validity has remained unsettled. We reformulate the PS approach for PBHs within the excursion-set framework, where the smoothed density contrast undergoes a stochastic random walk as the smoothing scale varies and collapse is identified with the first threshold crossing. While the halo case is described by a Markovian process, we show that the PBH case is non-Markovian, even when the sharp-k filter Window function is adopted. Decomposing the total collapse probability into two distinct components of the stochastic motion, we numerically confirm that their contributions are exactly equal in the case of halo formation, justifying the fudge factor. For PBHs, however, we demonstrate that this equality no longer holds, and consistent inclusion of both contributions is essential to ensure a positive-definite mass function. Our results clarify the origin of the ambiguity surrounding the fudge factor and establish a robust theoretical foundation for PBH abundance calculations.",

However, the rise of high-precision datasets has revealed statistically significant tensions, most notably the Hubble tension and the $S_8$ discrepancy, which challenge the completeness of this standard model. In this context, we explore the $\\Lambda_{\\rm s}$CDM model-an extension of $\\Lambda$CDM featuring a single additional parameter, $z_\\dagger$, corresponding to a sign-switching cosmological constant. This minimal modification aims to alleviate key observational tensions without compromising the model's overall coherence. Recent findings present in the literature indicate that the $\\Lambda_{\\rm s}$CDM model not only provides a better fit to Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest data for $z_\\dagger < 2.3$, but also accommodates both the SH0ES measurement of $H_0$ and the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface when 2D BAO data are included. We present a comprehensive analysis combining the full Planck 2018 CMB data, the Pantheon Type Ia Supernovae sample, and the recently released Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our finding reveal that the Preliminary DESI results, a possible $3.9\\sigma$ deviation from $\\Lambda$CDM expectations, reinforce the importance of exploring such dynamic dark energy frameworks. In sum, our study underscores the potential of $\\Lambda_{\\rm s}$CDM to reconcile multiple cosmological tensions and sheds light on the role of upcoming high-precision observations in reshaping our understanding of the universe's expansion history and the nature of dark energy.",

Kapaida High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) GW200105 is a compact binary coalescence (CBC) event, consisting of a neutron star and a black hole, observed in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's (LVK's) third observing run (O3). Recent reanalyses of the event using state-of-the-art waveform models have claimed observation of signatures of an eccentric orbit. It has nevertheless been pointed out in the literature that certain physical or modified gravity effects could mimic eccentricity by producing a spurious non-zero eccentricity value, at a given reference frequency, when recovered with an eccentric waveform model. We recently developed a model-independent Eccentricity Evolution Consistency Test (EECT, S. A. Bhat et al. 2025) to identify such mimickers, by comparing the measured frequency $\\textit{evolution}$ of eccentricity, $e(f)$, with that expected from General Relativity (GR). In this $\\textit{Letter}$, we apply EECT to GW200105 and find that it satisfies EECT within 68% confidence. Our analysis therefore lends complementary support in favour of the eccentricity hypothesis, while also providing a novel test of the consistency of $e(f)$ with GR.",

Instead of relying on the phenomenological parametrisation commonly used to capture curvature effects at the largest scales, we present a case study based on closed quadratic inflation, where the primordial spectrum is derived in full generality and in a gauge-invariant manner. Within this framework, we analyze both the $\\texttt{plik}$ PR3 and $\\texttt{CamSpec}$ PR4 Planck CMB likelihoods and find that the constraints on $\\Omega_{\\mathcal{K}}$ shift towards spatial flatness. In $\\texttt{plik}$ the preference for $\\Omega_{\\mathcal{K}}<0$ decreases from $\\gtrsim 3.5\\sigma$ to $\\sim 2.5\\sigma$, while in $\\texttt{CamSpec}$ it reduces to $\\sim 2\\sigma$. At large angular scales ($\\ell < 10$), our model explains the low-$\\ell$ power suppression anomaly, notably improving the fit to the quadrupole. However, the reduced preference for highly negative values of $\\Omega_{\\mathcal{K}}$ only partially accounts for the lensing anomaly at high multipoles, worsening the fit to the $\\texttt{plik}$ spectrum at small scales. By contrast, in the $\\texttt{CamSpec}$ PR4 spectrum, where the lensing anomaly is less pronounced, the model yields an overall improvement. Our analysis highlights a key conceptual point: closed-inflation models tie the curvature parameter to the inflationary dynamics and the primordial spectrum, enforcing consistency conditions that do not necessarily allow for the large deviations from flatness seen in phenomenological parametrisations. In the case of quadratic inflation, these restrictions reduce the apparent evidence for negative curvature reported by earlier analyses, while allowing for a mildly closed geometry.",

However, since the white dwarf habitable zone resides at 0.01 - 0.1 AU, planets residing there are subject to tidal heating if they have any orbital eccentricity. Previous work (Barnes & Heller 2013) identified nearby planetary companions as potential roadblocks to habitability of planets around white dwarfs, as such companions could induce secular oscillations in eccentricity for the potentially habitable planet, which could in turn heat a surface ocean and induce a runaway greenhouse for even very low values ($e \\sim 10^{-4}$) of the eccentricity of the potentially habitable planet. In this work, we examine the potential for general relativistic orbital precession to protect habitable planets orbiting white dwarfs from such a runaway greenhouse, and demonstrate that for some system architectures, general relativity can be protective for planetary habitability.",

The BINGO project will be one such survey, and this collaboration has already estimated a FRB detection rate that the project will yield. We present a forecast of the future constraints on our current cosmological model that the BINGO FRB detections and localizations will have when added to other current cosmological datasets. We quantify the dispersion measure (DM) as a function of redshift ($z$) for the BINGO FRB mock sample. Furthermore, we use current datasets (Supernovae, Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, and Cosmic Microwave Background data) prior to assessing the efficacy of constraining dark energy models using Monte Carlo methods. Our results show that spatially localized BINGO FRB dataset will provide promising constraints on the population of host galaxies intrinsic DM and be able to measure the nuisance parameters present within a FRB cosmological analysis. They will also provide alternative estimates on other parameters such as the Hubble constant and the dark energy equation of state. In particular, we should see that BINGO FRB data can put constraints on the degenerate $w-H_0$ plane, which the CMB is incapable of measuring, allowing FRBs to be a viable alternative to BAO to constrain the dark energy equation of state. We conclude that FRBs remain a promising future probe for cosmology and that the FRBs localized by the BINGO project will contribute significantly to our knowledge of the current cosmological model.",

Superradiance leads to an exponential growth of particle occupation numbers in gravitationally bound states. We present an analysis of heavy bosonic dark matter (DM) production through three gravitational mechanisms: Hawking radiation, superradiant instabilities, and ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in. We consider PBHs that evaporate before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). For both scalar and vector DM, our analysis incorporates the evolution of a second superradiant mode. We demonstrate that the growth of a second superradiant mode causes the decay of the first mode, and thus the second mode cannot further enhance the DM abundance beyond that already achieved by the first mode. Our study also reveals that while superradiance generally enhances DM production, gravitational wave (GW) emission from the superradiant cloud may significantly modify this picture. For scalar DM, GW emission reduces the parameter space where superradiance effectively augments relic abundance. For vector DM, rapid GW emission from the superradiant cloud may yield relic abundances below those achieved through Hawking radiation alone. These findings demonstrate that multiple-mode effect and GW emission play critical roles in modeling DM production from PBHs in the early universe.",

Conclusions unchanged Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance measurements and Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, we have measured the dark energy density $\\rho_X(z)$ and dark energy equation of state w_X(z) as free functions of redshift (smoothly interpolated from values at {z_i}={0, 1/3, 2/3, 1, 4/3, 2.33}, and find both to be consistent with a cosmological constant, with only deviations of 1\\sigma for $\\rho_X(z)$ & ~ 2$\\sigma$ for w_X(z) at z=2/3. We also find that measuring {$\\rho_X(z_i)$} is preferred to measuring {w_X(z_i)} by model selection using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) as well as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Varying the choice of redshift values of the $\\rho_X(z)$ measurements leads to very consistent results, with AIC/BIC slightly favoring the case of our fiducial {z_i} with z=4/3 omitted. We find agreement with a cosmological constant except for the 1-2$\\sigma$ deviation at 0.4 < z < 0.9, where DESI DR2 BAO measurements deviate from a cosmological constant at similar statistical significance. Our results differ noticeably from those of the DESI Collaboration, in which they used the same DESI DR2 data combined with Planck data and found a 3.1$\\sigma$ deviation from a cosmological constant, which is primarily the consequence of their assuming parametrization w_X(z)=w_0+w_a(1-a). Our results indicate that assuming a linear w_X(z) could be misleading and precludes discovering how dark energy actually varies with time at higher redshifts. In our quest to discover the physical nature of dark energy, the most urgent goal at present is to determine definitively whether dark energy density varies with time. It is of critical importance to measure dark energy density as a free function of redshift from data. Future galaxy redshift surveys by Euclid and Roman at higher redshifts will significantly advance our understanding of dark energy.",

Submitted to A&A Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The hot gas in the outskirts of galaxy cluster-sized halos, extending around and beyond the virial radius into nearby accretion regions, remains among one of the least explored baryon components of large-scale cosmic structure. We present a stacking analysis of 680 galaxy clusters located in the western Galactic hemisphere, using data from the first two years of the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey. The stacked X-ray surface brightness profile reveals a statistically significant signal extending out to 2r200m (~4.5 Mpc). The best-fit surface brightness profile is well described by a combination of terms describing orbiting and infalling gas, with a transition occurring around r200m. At this radius, the best-fit gas density is 2.5e-5 cm^-3, corresponding to a baryon overdensity of 30. By integrating the gas density profile out to r200m, we infer a gas fraction of 90% of the universal baryon fraction with the assumption of a typical halo concentration, indicating the completeness of the baryon budget within large radii. Additionally, we examine the hot gas distribution in massive clusters in the IllustrisTNG simulations from the halo center to the accretion region. This analysis reveals differences in radial gas profiles depending on whether the direction probes voids or nearby cosmic filaments. Beyond r200m, the density profile along the filament direction exceeds that along the void direction. This pattern aligns with the observed transition radius between the one-halo and two-halo terms, suggesting that r200m is the approximate radius marking the location at which cosmic filaments connect to galaxy clusters. Meanwhile, the comparisons of the gas density profile and gas fraction profile between the observation and the IllustrisTNG simulation suggest that the feedback processes in the stacking sample are more efficient than the IllustrisTNG model in distributing gas to large radii.",

They are crucial to constrain cosmological parameters, understand the structure formation and evolution of our Universe, and they could also be pristine laboratories for studying galaxy formation without all the hassle due to environmental effects. Thus, the ability to accurately and consistently identify voids, both in numerical simulations and in observations, becomes mandatory. We present Algorithm for Void Identification in coSMology (AVISM), a new void finder for analysing both cosmological simulation outputs and observational galaxy catalogues. In the first case, the code should handle raw particle or cell data, dark matter halos or synthetic galaxy catalogues. In the case of observational data, the code should be coupled with external tools providing with the required dynamical information to apply the algorithm. A set of numerical tests designed to assess the code's capabilities are carried out. AVISM's performance is also compared, both statistically and on a one-to-one basis, with the DIVE and ZOBOV state-of-the-art void finders using as input a dark matter halo catalogue from a large-volume cosmological simulation. An application to a galaxy survey is provided to demonstrate the code's ability to handle real data. We have designed a new void finder algorithm that combines geometrical and dynamical information to identify void regions plus a hierarchical merging process to reconstruct the whole 3D structure of the void. The outcome of this process is a void catalogue with complex boundaries without assuming a prior shape. This process can be repeated at different levels of resolution using finer grids, leading to a list of voids-in-voids and a proper description of void substructure.",

The large-scale structure, also called the cosmic web, is thus a result of the topology of the CDM manifold. Initial crossing of particle trajectories occurs at the critical points of this manifold, forming singularities that seed most of the collapsed structures. The cosmic web can thus be characterized using the points of singularities. In this context, we employ catastrophe theory in 2D to study the motion around such singularities and analytically model the shape of the emerging structures, particularly the pancakes, which later evolve into halos and filaments-the building blocks of the 2D web. We compute higher-order corrections to the shape of the pancakes, including properties such as the curvature and the scale of transition from their C to S shape. Using Gaussian statistics (with the assumption of Zeldovich flow) for our model parameters, we also compute the distributions of observable features related to the shape of pancakes and their variation across halo and filament populations in 2D cosmologies. We find that a larger fraction of pancakes evolve into filaments, they are more curved if they are to evolve into halos, are dominantly C-shaped, and the nature of shell-crossing is highly anisotropic. Extending this work to 3D will allow testing of predictions against actual observations of the cosmic web and searching for signatures of non-Gaussianity at corresponding scales.",

To do this, we use weak lensing convergence maps from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 data, and construct corresponding galaxy convergence maps at $z\\lesssim1.0$, representing projected galaxy number density fluctuations weighted by lensing efficiency. The two maps show overall agreement. However, we could identify 22 regions where the dark matter density exhibits an excess compared to the galaxy density. After carefully examining the survey depths and proximity to survey boundaries, we select seven of the most probable candidates for dark structures. This sample provides valuable testbeds for further investigations into dark matter mapping. Moreover, our method will be very useful for future studies of dark structures as large-scale weak-lensing surveys become available, such as the $\\textit{Euclid}$ mission, the Vera C.

We begin by defining generalized higher-order distortions and outlining methods for measuring them. Then, using several lens models, we examine how these distortions affect shear and flexion measurements. Our results show that neglecting higher-order distortions can introduce systematic errors of a few percent in both shear and flexion measurements, indicating that these effects cannot be ignored. Although the strength of these errors depends on factors such as lensing strength and the size of background sources, we demonstrate that simultaneous measurement of higher-order distortions can reduce the systematic errors to below 1% in most cases.",

Submitted to The Astrophysical Journal Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The peak model of structure formation was built more than fifty years ago with the aim to address the origin of dark matter halo rotation in the tidal torque theory (TTT). Paradoxically, it has allowed one to explain and reproduce all halo properties found in cosmological simulations except their rotation, which remains to be understood. With the present two Papers we remedy this anomaly. In Paper I we derived the angular momentum (AM) of protohalos centered on triaxial peaks of suited scale, taking into account that, to leading order, their density profile is smooth and homogeneous. Here we use that result to derive the AM of these objects, accounting for the fact that their actual density profile is slightly outward decreasing and lumpy so that they do not collapse monolithically at once, but progressively from inside out, undergoing mergers during the process. By monitoring in detail their resulting mass and AM growth, we characterize the spin distribution of final halos and the precise mass and radial distribution of their inner mean specific AM. The results obtained explain and reproduce the rotational properties of simulated halos.",

Thus, the DE EoS covers the parameter space corresponding to the popular single scalar-field dark energy models, i.e., Quintessence. The cosmological model comprises 6 parameters of the $\\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\\Lambda$CDM) model, and additionally the dynamical DE EoS parameters ($w_0$, $w_a$), the scaling of the lensing amplitude ($A_{\\rm lens}$), sum of the neutrino masses ($\\sum m_\\nu$), the effective number of non-photon relativistic degrees of freedom ($N_{\\rm eff}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index ($\\alpha_s$). We derive constraints on the parameters by combining the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release (DR) 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements with cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra from Planck Public Release (PR) 4, CMB lensing data from Planck PR4 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6, uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae (SNe) data from the Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 5 (DESY5) samples, and Weak Lensing (WL) data from DES Year 1. Our major finding is that with CMB+BAO+WL and CMB+BAO+SNe+WL, we find 3$\\sigma$+ evidence for $A_{\\rm lens} >1$, indicating a higher than expected CMB lensing amplitude relative to the NPDDE prediction of unity. This implies that for cosmology to accommodate realistic quintessence-like dark energy models (as opposed to unrealistic phantom DE), one would also need to explain a relatively significant presence of the lensing anomaly.",

Comments are welcome! Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Time-delay cosmography, by monitoring the multiply imaged gravitational lenses in the time domain, offers a promising and independent method for measuring cosmological distances. However, in addition to the main deflector that produces the multiple images, the large-scale structure along the line-of-sight (LoS) will also deflect the traveling light rays, known as weak lensing (WL). Due to resolution limitations, accurately measuring WL on arcsecond scales is highly challenging. In this work, we evaluate the LoS effects on both lensing images and time-delay measurements using a more straightforward, high-resolution N-body simulation that provides a more realistic matter distribution compared to the traditional, computationally cheaper halo rendering method. We employ the multi-plane ray tracing technique, which is traditionally utilized to compute WL effects at the arcminute scale, extending its application to the strong lensing regime at the arcsecond scale. We focus on the quadruple-image system and present the following findings: 1. In addition to a constant external convergence, large-scale structures within a region approximately 2 arcminutes in angular size act as external perturbers, inducing inhomogeneous fluctuations on the arcsecond scale; 2. These fluctuations cannot be fully accounted for by external shear alone, necessitating the inclusion of external flexion; 3. While incorporating flexion provides a reasonably good fit to the lensing image, the time-delay distance still exhibits a $6.2$\\textperthousand~bias and a $2.5\\%$ uncertainty. This underscores the limitations of the single-plane approximation, as time-delay errors accumulate along the LoS.",

Medium-band photometry has emerged as a potential technique for efficiently selecting these high-redshift galaxies. In this work, we present clustering analysis of medium-band selected galaxies at high redshift, utilizing photometric data from the Intermediate Band Imaging Survey (IBIS) and spectroscopic data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We interpret the clustering of such samples using both Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) modeling and a perturbation theory description of large-scale structure. Our modeling indicates that the current target sample is composed from an overlapping mixture of LAEs and LBGs with emission lines. Despite differences in target selection, we find that the clustering properties are consistent with previous studies, with correlation lengths $r_0\\simeq 3-4\\,h^{-1}$Mpc and a linear bias of $b\\sim1.8-2.5$. Finally, we discuss the simulation requirements implied by these measurements and demonstrate that the properties of the samples would make them excellent targets to enhance our understanding of the high-$z$ universe.",

      "abstract": "Tests of Evolving Dark Energy with Geometric Probes of the Late Late-Time Universe Kunhao Zhong, Bhuvnesh Jain Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) have shown a strong statistical preference for a time-evolving dark energy model over $\\Lambda$CDM when combining BAO, CMB, and supernova (SN) data. We investigate the robustness of this conclusion by isolating geometric information in weak lensing measurements from the DES Year 3 survey and combining it with different datasets. We introduce a hyperparameter, $\\Omega_{\\rm m}^{\\rm growth}$, to decouple the growth contribution from the lensing 2-point correlation and thus bypass the possible effect of the $\\sigma_8$ tension in our analysis. We then combine with the late-time geometric probes provided by BAO and SN, along with CMB primary data. The preference for evolving dark energy is consistent with the DESI-DR2 findings: when combining BAO, primary CMB, and weak lensing data, the $w_0w_a$CDM is preferred at about the $3\\sigma$ significance. However, when we add SN, the result is sensitive to the choice of data: if we leave out $z<0.1$ SN data in the analysis, as a test of the effect of inhomogeneous calibration, we obtain a statistical significance below $2\\sigma$ for time evolving dark energy. Indeed, the high-z only SN data \\textbf{lowers} the evidence for evolving dark energy in all the data combinations we have examined. This underscores the importance of improved SN samples at low redshift and of alternative data combinations. We show that cosmic shear measurements with LSST Year 1 data will provide comparable power to current SN data. We discuss other low-redshift probes provided by lensing and galaxy clustering to test for evolving dark energy.",

In this work, we present two approaches to reconstruct and constrain the galaxy formation time $t_f(z)$ using non-parametric reconstruction methods, such as Gaussian Processes (GP) and High-performance Symbolic Regression (SR). Our analysis uses age estimates of 32 old passive galaxies and the Pantheon+ type Ia supernova sample, and considers two different values of the Hubble constant $H_0$ from the SH0ES and Planck Collaborations. When adopting the $\\Lambda$CDM model and the GP reconstructions, we find $\\left<t_f\\right>=0.72_{-0.16}^{+0.14}$ Gyr (SH0ES) and $\\left<t_f\\right>=1.26_{-0.11}^{+0.10}$ Gyr (Planck). Without considering a specific cosmological model, we obtain $\\left<t_f\\right>=0.71 \\pm {0.19}$ Gyr (SH0ES) and $\\left<t_f\\right> = 1.35_{-0.23}^{+0.21}$ Gyr (Planck). Similar values are obtained from the SR reconstructions, with both methods (GP and SR) indicating the same behavior regarding the time evolution of $t_f(z)$. The results also show significant differences in the formation time from SH0ES and Planck values, highlighting the impact of the $H_0$ tension on the cosmological estimates of $t_f(z)$. In particular, the different approaches used in the analysis agree with each other, demonstrating the robustness and consistency of our results. Overall, this study suggests that galaxies have different evolutionary timescales and that $t_f$ is not constant, with noticeable variations at lower redshifts ($z \\lesssim 0.5$).",

Richings, Evgenii Chaikin, Matthieu Schaller, James W. Trayford, Carlos S. Frenk, Filip Huško, Camila Correa Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present the implementation and testing of a subgrid non-explosive pre-supernova (NEPS) feedback module for the COLIBRE model of galaxy formation. The NEPS module incorporates three key physical processes sourced by young, massive stars that act immediately following star formation: momentum injection from stellar winds and radiation pressure, and thermal energy from photoheating in HII regions. The age- and metallicity-dependent energy and momentum budgets are derived from BPASS stellar population models and are coupled self-consistently to the local gas properties. We test the model using a suite of smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of isolated, unstable gaseous disks at various numerical resolutions (gas particle masses in the range $10^4-10^6$ $\\rm M_{\\odot}$). We find that the NEPS module successfully regulates star formation by providing pressure support that prevents catastrophic gas collapse. This regulation improves the numerical convergence of star formation rates and disk structure. In our model, feedback from HII regions is the dominant regulatory mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate a crucial synergy with subsequent supernova feedback; NEPS feedback pre-processes the interstellar medium, creating a more homogeneous environment that moderates the effect of explosive feedback from supernova events. Our NEPS module thus provides a physically motivated and numerically robust framework that mitigates resolution-dependent artefacts and promotes self-regulated galaxy growth.",

Central versus Satellite Classification Haley Bowden, Peter Behroozi Submitted to the Open Journal of Astrophysics; 17 pages, 18 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) A physical understanding of galaxy formation and evolution benefits from an understanding of the connections between galaxies, their host dark matter halos, and their environments. In particular, interactions with more-massive neighbors can leave lasting imprints on both galaxies and their hosts. Distinguishing between populations of galaxies with differing environments and interaction histories is therefore essential for isolating the role of environment in shaping galaxy properties. We present a novel neural-network based method, which takes advantage of observable measures of a galaxy and its environment to recover whether it (1) is a central or a satellite, (2) has experienced an interaction with a more massive neighbor, and (3) is currently orbiting or infalling onto such a neighbor. We find that projected distances to, redshift separations of, and relative stellar masses with respect to a galaxy's 25 nearest neighbors are sufficient to distinguish central from satellite halos in $> 90\\%$ of cases, with projection effects accounting for most classification errors. Our method also achieves high accuracy in recovering interaction history and orbital status, though the network struggles to distinguish between splashback and infalling systems in some cases due to the lack of velocity information. With careful treatment of the uncertainties introduced by projection and other observational limitations, this method offers a new avenue for studying the role of environment in galaxy formation and evolution.",

The data of the TNG-Cluster simulation is now fully public and accessible at this URL this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Shock fronts driven by active galactic nuclei in galaxy cluster cores represent a promising mechanism to heat the intracluster gas by converting kinetic energy into thermal energy through gas compression, thereby offsetting radiative cooling. Despite their potential importance, such shocks are challenging to detect, requiring deep X-ray exposures, and have only been identified in ten clusters. We present the first systematic detection and characterization of AGN-driven shocks in simulated clusters from the TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamic cosmological zoom-in simulations of galaxies. TNG-Cluster exhibits a rich variety of X-ray structures, including realistic populations of X-ray cavities, as well as shocks, produced by its AGN feedback model, without collimated, relativistic jets, nor cosmic rays. We produce mock Chandra observations with deep exposure times, for a sample of 100 clusters, mass-matched (M$_{500c}=1.2$ - $8.5 \\times 10^{14}$ M$_\\odot$) to the ten observed clusters with shocks. Using observational techniques, we identify shocks through surface brightness edges fitted with broken power laws and associated density and temperature jumps. We detect 50 shocks in 30 of the 100 clusters, with ~35% hosting multiple shocks. These shocks lie within a hundred kiloparsec of the central SMBH, are weak (Mach number < 2, median ~ 1.1), and are associated with cavities in about half of the cases. Both in observations and in TNG-Cluster, shocks tend to be located at larger radii than cavities, with median offsets of 46 and 27 kpc, respectively. The observationally inferred shock powers are comparable to the cluster cooling luminosities (10$^{44-46}$ erg s$^{-1}$), suggesting that shocks in the simulation are crucial heating mechanisms. Our results indicate that shocks play a role as important as cavities in balancing cooling in cluster cores, acting isotropically and up to larger distances.",

Hayes, Suhail Dhawan, Stephen Thorp, Justin D. R. Pierel, Nikki Arendse 30 pages, 13 figures; submitted to MNRAS Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The delay in arrival time of the multiple images of gravitationally lensed supernovae (glSNe) can be related to the present-day expansion rate of the universe, $H_{0}$. Despite their rarity, Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (Rubin-LSST) is expected to discover tens of galaxy-scale glSNe per year, many of which will not be resolved due to their compact nature. Follow-up from ground- and space-based telescopes will be necessary to estimate time delays to sufficient precision for meaningful $H_{0}$ constraints. We present the Glimpse model (GausSN Light curve Inference of Magnifications and Phase Shifts, Extended) that estimates time delays with resolved and unresolved observations together for the first time, while simultaneously accounting for dust and microlensing effects. With this method, we explore best follow-up strategies for glSNe observed by Rubin-LSST. For unresolved systems on the dimmest end of detectability by Rubin-LSST, having peak i-band magnitudes of 22-24 mag, the time delays are measured to as low as 0.7 day uncertainty with 6-8 epochs of resolved space-based observations in each of 4-6 optical and NIR filters. For systems of similar brightness that are resolved by ground-based facilities, time delays are consistently constrained to 0.5-0.8 day precision with 6 epochs in 4 optical and NIR filters of space-based observations or 8 epochs in 4 optical filters of deep ground-based observations. This work improves on previous time-delay estimation methods and demonstrates that glSNe time delays of $\\sim10-20$ days can be measured to sufficient precision for competitive $H_{0}$ estimates in the Rubin-LSST era.",

Comments Welcome Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The upcoming galaxy large-scale surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), will generate photometry for billions of galaxies. The interpretation of large-scale weak lensing maps, as well as the estimation of galaxy clustering, requires reliable redshifts with high precision for multi-band photometry. However, obtaining spectroscopy for billions of galaxies is impractical and complex; therefore, having a sufficiently large number of galaxies with spectroscopic observations to train supervised algorithms for accurate redshift estimation is a significant challenge and an open research area. We propose a novel methodology called Co-SOM, based on Co-training and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), integrating labeled (sources with spectroscopic redshifts) and unlabeled (sources with photometric observations only) data during the training process, through a selection method based on map topology (connectivity structure of the SOM lattice) to leverage the limited spectroscopy available for photo-z estimation. We utilized the magnitudes and colors of Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 18 (SDSS-DR18) to analyze and evaluate the performance, varying the proportion of labeled data and adjusting the training parameters. For training sets of 1% of labeled data ($\\approx 20{,}000$ galaxies) we achieved a performance of bias $\\Delta z = 0.00007 \\pm 0.00022$, precision $\\sigma_{zp} = 0.00063 \\pm 0.00032$, and outlier fraction $f_{\\mathrm{out}} = 0.02083 \\pm 0.00027$. Additionally, we conducted experiments varying the volume of labeled data, and the bias remains below $10^{-3}$, regardless of the size of the spectroscopic or photometric data. These low-redshift results demonstrate the potential of semi-supervised learning to address spectroscopic limitations in future photometric surveys.",

Previous CALET observing runs (O3 and O4) relied on averaged pre/post-event baselines or low-order polynomial fits, approaches that neglect correlated noise, temporal non-stationarity, and the propagation of background uncertainty into derived flux upper limits. These simplifications can lead to reduced sensitivity to faint or atypical transients. In this work, we present a novel Bayesian framework for background estimation based on Gaussian Process (GP) regression and change-point modeling. Our approach captures correlated structures in the detector background, quantifies predictive uncertainties, and propagates them into both detection statistics and Bayesian credible upper limits. We demonstrate, using archival CALET time-tagged event data and simulated signal injections, that our method improves sensitivity to weak short-duration bursts by up to an order of magnitude compared to traditional polynomial fits. This probabilistic background treatment enables a more physically robust interpretation of non-detections and offers a scalable, real-time compatible extension for future joint multi-messenger searches.

Submitted. Comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Dark matter (DM) subhalos offer critical tests of cosmological models through their abundance and properties, yet most remain undetectable due to their lack of stars. We investigate whether their presence leaves measurable imprints on the projected stellar density fields of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Building on literature $N$-body experiments, we show that subhalo interactions induce subtle out-of-equilibrium fluctuations appearing as density corrugations. In a CDM framework, these fluctuations are dominated by the most massive subhalos in the host halo. We develop a Fourier-based framework to quantify these features, identifying characteristic peaks in the spatial frequency spectrum that are well described by Voigt profiles. The peak parameters are sensitive to both the subhalo mass function and the number of stellar tracers. For the configurations tested, $N_{\\star} \\sim 10^5$ stars suffice to detect subhalo populations with $M_{\\rm subhalo} \\lesssim 10^6~\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, while larger masses produce stronger and more complex signatures. We assess the feasibility of this technique by analyzing Gaia and HST data: in this context, the Fornax dwarf shows residual low-frequency structures resembling those in our controlled subhalo experiments, making it an interesting case for follow-up. Prospectively, wide-field surveys such as Euclid, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory are expected to deliver stellar samples of $N_{\\star} \\sim 10^5$ per dwarf, offering compelling prospects for probing subhalo imprints.

This never-ending search for dark matter leads to consider alternatives. Since increasing the enclosed mass is the only way to explain the flat appearance of galaxies' rotation curves in a Newtonian framework, the MOND theory proposed to modify Newton's dynamics when the acceleration is around or below a threshold value, $a_0$. Observed rotation curves, generally flat at large distances, are then usually well reproduced by MOND with $a_0 \\sim 1.2 10^{-10}$ m/s$^{2}$. However, the recent Gaia evidence of a decline in the Milky Way rotation curve is a distinct behavior. Therefore, we examine whether MOND can accommodate the Gaia declining rotation curve of the Milky Way. We first depict a standard model to describe the Milky Way's baryonic components. Secondly, we show that a NFW (Navarro, Frenk, \\& White ) model is able to fit the decline, assuming a scale radius $R_s$ of the order of $4$ kpc. In a third step, we show that the usual MOND paradigm is not able to reproduce the declining part for a standard baryonic model. Finally, we examine whether the MOND theory can accommodate the declining part of the rotation curve when relaxing the characteristics of the baryonic components. To do so we use a MCMC method on the characteristics of the stellar and the HI disk, including their mass. We found that the stellar disk should be massive, of the order of $10^{11}$ M$_{\\odot}$. The HI disk mass is capped at nearly 1.8 $ 10^{11}$ M$_{\\odot}$ but could also be negligible. Finally, $a_0$ is consistent with 0, with an upper limit of $0.53 10^{-10}$ m/s$^{2}$ (95\\%), a value much lower than the above mentioned value usually advocated to explain standard flat rotation curves in MOND theory.",

We created 1728 simulated lightcones and studied the apparent level of anisotropy traced by X-ray and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich scaling relations in the same cluster sample selection and methodology as in the past study. We find the probability of such apparent anisotropies randomly emerging in cluster scaling relations within a $\\Lambda$CDM universe to be $0.12\\%\\, (3.2\\sigma)$. The discrepancy goes up to $\\sim 3.6\\sigma$ when modelled as a bulk flow at $z < 0.1$. We also find that statistical noise accounts for over $80\\%$ of the anisotropy amplitude in each lightcone, with large peculiar velocities contributing less than $20\\%$. We also show that anisotropy amplitudes are highly sensitive to the intrinsic scatter in the scaling relations, with tighter relations providing stronger constraints. Nevertheless, the tension between the past results and $\\Lambda$CDM persists, albeit at a lower significance than previously reported.",

These results agree with the DESI DR2 analysis. To assess the role of early-universe information, we add a Gaussian prior on rd from Planck DR3 rather than using the full CMB likelihood. Fixing rd isolates the BAO-ruler calibration and yields no significant evidence for dynamical dark energy. The key discriminator is which early-time anchor is held fixed; anchoring theta-ast can raise Omegam in w0waCDM, increasing r-ast and DA(z-ast) to keep theta-ast constant, thereby mimicking late-time evolution, whereas anchoring rd does not. We therefore advocate a robustness test comparing fixed-rd and fixed theta-ast analyses; under the former, DESI DR2 BAO remain fully consistent with LCDM.",

      "abstract": "Deriving accurate galaxy cluster masses using X-ray thermodynamic profiles and graph neural networks Asif Iqbal, Subhabrata Majumdar, Elena Rasia, Gabriel W. Pratt, Daniel de Andres, Jean-Baptiste Melin, Weiguang Cui 20 pages, 15 figures, 6 tables, accepted in A&A Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Precise determination of galaxy cluster masses is crucial for establishing reliable mass-observable scaling relations in cluster cosmology. We employ graph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate galaxy cluster masses from radially sampled profiles of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) inferred from X-ray observations. GNNs naturally handle inputs of variable length and resolution by representing each ICM profile as a graph, enabling accurate and flexible modeling across diverse observational conditions. We trained and tested GNN model using state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters from The Three Hundred Project. The mass estimates using our method exhibit no systematic bias compared to the true cluster masses in the simulations. Additionally, we achieve a scatter in recovered mass versus true mass of about 6%, which is a factor of six smaller than obtained from a standard hydrostatic equilibrium approach. Our algorithm is robust to both data quality and cluster morphology and it is capable of incorporating model uncertainties alongside observational uncertainties. Finally, we apply our technique to XMM-Newton observed galaxy cluster samples and compare the GNN derived mass estimates with those obtained with $Y_{\\rm SZ}$-M$_{500}$ scaling relations. Our results provide strong evidence, at 5$\\sigma$ level, for a mass-dependent bias in SZ derived masses, with higher mass clusters exhibiting a greater degree of deviation. Furthermore, we find the median bias to be $(1-b)=0.85_{-0.14}^{+0.34}$, albeit with significant dispersion due to its mass dependence. This work takes a significant step towards establishing unbiased observable mass scaling relations by integrating X-ray, SZ and optical datasets using deep learning techniques, thereby enhancing the role of galaxy clusters in precision cosmology.",

The number density of galaxies with absolute magnitudes $-19<M_\\mathrm{UV}<-18$ at $z\\sim17$ ($z\\sim25$) is a factor of 4 (25) smaller than at $z\\sim12$; the luminosity density presents a similar evolution.

There are few robust theoretical predictions for the evolution of galaxies above $z\\sim20$ in the literature, however, the continuing rapid drop in the halo mass function would predict a more rapid evolution than we observe if photon production efficiencies remained constant.

Their average stellar mass is $\\mathrm{M}_\\bigstar\\sim10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$, implying a stellar-to-baryon mass fraction around 10% if the emissivity increases with redshift, or significantly higher otherwise. Three candidates present very blue UV spectral slopes ($\\beta\\sim-3$) compatible with Pop III young ($\\lesssim10$ Myr) stars and/or high escape fractions of ionizing photons; the rest have $\\beta\\sim-2.5$ similar to $z=10-12$ samples.",

The origin of such states has been a persistent mystery, particularly because the physics of collisionless relaxation has remained poorly understood. To solve this long-standing problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation that describes the secular evolution of the mean coarse-grained distribution function $f_0$ of accreted matter in the fluctuating force field of a spherical isotropic halo. The diffusion coefficient not only depends on the fluctuation power spectrum but also on the evolving potential of the system, which reflects the self-consistency of the problem. Diffusive heating by an initially cored halo develops an $r^{-1}$ cusp in the density profile of the accreted material, with $r$ the halocentric radius, if it is initially shallower than $r^{-1}$. This is fundamentally a consequence of the virial theorem: self-gravitating systems have a negative specific heat and want to cool down when energized. The inner halo relaxes to an $r^{-1}$ cusp because its central region is the coldest among all $r^{-\\gamma}$ profiles with $0\\leq \\gamma \\leq 2$. Accretion and relaxation in the $r^{-1}$ cusp develops an $r^{-3}$ outer fall-off, thereby establishing the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile. We demonstrate for the first time that this profile emerges as a steady state solution to the problem of self-consistent collisionless relaxation.",

Reference updated The Astrophysical Journal 991, 11 (2025) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid-mass window are compelling dark matter candidates, made plausible by the existence of black holes and by the variety of mechanisms of their production in the early universe. If a PBH falls into a white dwarf (WD), the strong tidal forces can generate enough heat to trigger a thermonuclear runaway explosion, depending on the WD mass and the PBH orbital parameters. In this work, we investigate the WD explosion triggered by the passage of PBH. We perform 2D simulations of the WD undergoing thermonuclear explosion in this scenario, with the predicted ignition site as the parameter assuming the deflagration-detonation transition model. We study the explosion dynamics and predict the associated light curves and nucleosynthesis. We find that the model sequence predicts the light curves which align with the Phillip's relation ($B_{\\max}$ vs. $\\Delta M_{15}$). Our models hint at a unifying approach in triggering Type Ia supernovae without involving two distinctive evolutionary tracks.",

Cackett, Jonathan Gelbord, Juan V. Hernández Santisteban, Keith Horne, Gerard A. Kriss 21 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables. Accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) In the past decade, Swift has performed several AGN high-cadence reverberation mapping campaigns, and generally found that the UV/optical interband lags are $\\sim$3 times longer than predicted for a standard thin disk, thus coined \"the accretion disk size problem\". Here we present a systematic sample of Swift-monitored AGN. In this analysis, we confirm the accretion disk size problem, but find that the lag excess occurs only in the subset of obscured AGN, which show a significantly elevated mean normalization of $5.21 \\pm 0.47$ ($p = 0.008$), whereas the unobscured AGN exhibit a mean excess consistent with standard disk predictions ($1.00 \\pm 0.31$). Correlation and regression analyses similarly reveal X-ray column density as the strongest predictor of lag excess, explaining over 80% of its variance. We interpret these results as line-of-sight obscuration being linked to the too-long lags via additional reprocessed emission from the absorbing material itself. The consistency of lags in the unobscured subgroup with standard disk predictions suggests that the accretion disk size problem is not the result of shortcomings of standard accretion disk theory nor contamination by the broad-line region (BLR). X-ray to UV lag amplitudes and correlations show more complex and variable behavior in obscured AGN, suggesting that obscuration may disrupt or complicate the connection between high- and low-energy emission potentially through reprocessing, scattering, and/or ionization changes.",

Comments welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The accretion flow in AGN is not well understood, motivating intensive monitoring campaigns of multiwavelength variability to probe its structure. One of the best of these is the 3 year optical/UV/X-ray approximately daily monitoring campaign on Fairall\\,9, a fairly typical moderate accretion rate AGN. The UV lightcurve shows a clear increase over $\\sim 50$ days between years 1 and 2, strongly coherent with the X-ray lightcurve rise. This changes the average spectral energy distribution such that the disc component is stronger while the X-ray spectrum steepens, so that the total X-ray power remains roughly constant. Outside of this global change, we apply a Fourier resolved analysis to test stochastic models where intrinsic fluctuations in the UV disc propagate down into the hard X-ray emission region via both changing the seed photon flux for Compton scattering (short light travel timescale) and changing the electron density (longer propagation timescale). Unlike these models, the hard X-rays are not particularly well correlated with the UV, and also have the wrong sign in that the hard X-rays marginally lead the UV fluctuations. We show that this is instead consistent with uncorrelated stochastic fluctuations in both the UV (slow) and X-ray (fast), which are linked together only weakly via light travel time. These variability properties, as well as the changes in the SED, has implications for our understanding of AGN structure and physics, as well as future monitoring campaigns.",

We analytically analyze the early emission produced by a shock with velocity $v$ traversing a material of mass $M_\\mathrm{e}$ and opacity $\\kappa$ extending to radius $R_\\mathrm{e}$, and show the emission varies qualitatively with varying $\\tau_\\mathrm{e}=\\kappa\\!M_\\mathrm{e}/(4\\pi\\!R_\\mathrm{e}^2)$: For $\\tau_\\mathrm{e}\\gg\\!c/v$ a shock breakout occurs near $R_\\mathrm{e}$ producing an ``edge breakout\"- a UV-dominated breakout burst followed by ``cooling emission\" of the shock-heated material; for $\\tau_\\mathrm{e}\\lesssim\\!c/v$ a ``wind breakout\" occurs- the breakout pulse is prolonged and followed by extended emission shifting from UV to X-ray as the shock becomes collisionless. We derive the dependence on $\\{v,\\kappa,M_\\mathrm{e},R_\\mathrm{e}\\}$ of the duration and luminosity characterizing the different emission phases, and show that current observations typically do not allow inference of all parameters. In particular, since the optical bands lie in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of radiation emitted during the cooling phase, the observed cooling luminosity depends weakly on radius, $\\propto\\!R_\\mathrm{e}^{1/4}$, leading to $1-2$ orders of magnitude uncertainty in its inferred value. This suggests, e.g., that the common day-scale light curve features in Stripped-Envelope SNe do not necessarily imply material extending to $R_\\mathrm{e}\\sim10^3\\!R_\\odot$ and are often consistent with low-mass $R_\\mathrm{e}\\sim\\!10^2\\!R_\\odot$ bound envelopes.

We present a non parametric, model-independent joint reconstruction of the redshift evolution of BBH mass distribution from gravitational wave (GW) catalog GWTC-4.0 from the fourth observation of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK). This method simultaneously searches for the signature of any linear and quadratic redshift evolution with respect to the low redshift in a Bayesian framework taking into accounting the detector selection effects. We find tentative evidence for a linear redshift-dependent evolution of the mass distribution, consistent over a mass range ($m \\gtrsim 50\\,M_\\odot$). While lower mass systems shows no signature of evolution. The quadratic term remains consistent with zero, indicating that a simple linear dependence adequately describes the population up to redshift $z \\sim 1$.

Contribution to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC2025), Geneva, Switzerland, July 2025 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The recent announcement of the detection of the ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrino event KM3-230213A by the KM3NeT telescope represents a critical opportunity to explore the origins of cosmic neutrinos and their potential gamma-ray counterparts. With an inferred neutrino energy exceeding 100 PeV, this event stands as the most energetic neutrino observed to date. The large offset from the galactic plane (11 degrees) and the presence of several blazars with temporally correlated multiwavelength counterparts within the 3 degrees localization region raise the possibility of an extragalactic origin. Additionally, the event's apparent tension with IceCube constraints suggests that it could be transient in nature rather than cosmogenic. VERITAS conducted a targeted follow-up campaign to search for very-high-energy (VHE, greater than 100 GeV) gamma-ray emission associated with KM3-230213A. Observations were performed in February and March 2025, using a four-point wobble strategy centered on the best-fit neutrino position, covering nearly the entire 90 percent confidence region. These observations probe potential hadronic gamma-ray emission from a common origin with the neutrino, placing constraints on particle-acceleration scenarios. We present the results of this search, including upper limits on very-high-energy gamma-ray flux and their implications for possible source models of KM3-230213A.",

Submitted to PASP High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Calcium-rich gap transients are a faint, fast-evolving class of supernovae that show strong nebular Ca emission lines. Their progenitor systems are uncertain, but they are often associated with old and quiescent host galaxies. In this work, we compare the properties of the hosts of hydrogen-poor Ca-rich gap transients to the hosts of 3 other classes of supernova (SNe): normal Type Ia, 91bg-like, and Type II. We use data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Census of the Local Universe (CLU) experiment to build up our 4 SNe samples and identify the host galaxies. A combination of precomputed host properties from the CLU catalog and those derived from SED fitting are used to characterize each host's stellar mass, star formation rate, and specific star formation rate (sSFR). We find that the hosts of Ca-rich gap transients and 91bg-like SNe occupy a similar parameter space of mass and sSFR, and are more massive and quiescent compared to the hosts of Type Ia and Type II SNe. Additionally, we construct delay time distributions (DTDs) for our 4 samples, finding that Ca-rich gap transients and 91bg-like SNe have the longest peak delay times $\\sim 10^4$ Myr, compared to the peak delay times of Type Ia SNe ($\\sim 10^3$ Myr) and Type II SNe ($\\sim 10$ Myr). The similarity of host environment and DTDs for Ca-rich gap transients and 91bg-like SNe motivates further analysis of the relationship of these two transient classes.",

Alsaberi, Jun Kataoka High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present on results of a spatially resolved spectral analysis of G1.9+0.3, the youngest known supernova remnant in the Galaxy. The X-ray spectra are well described by synchrotron emission from a power-law electron distribution with an exponential cutoff. We found a cutoff energy $\\epsilon_0 \\sim 1 ~ \\rm{keV}$ in both the radio bright rim and the X-ray bright rims. In the loss-limited case, the cutoff energy depends on the shock velocity $v_{\\rm{sh}}$ and the Bohm factor $\\eta$, following the relation $\\epsilon_0 \\propto v_{\\rm{sh}}^2 \\eta^{-1} $. Our analysis shows that $\\eta$ ranges from 2 to 4 in the radio rim and from 12 to 15 in the X-ray rims. This suggests that the magnetic field in the radio rim is more turbulent than in the X-ray rims. The presence of CO clouds along the radio rim likely contributes to this difference. Interaction between the shock and these clouds can slow the shock down and generate turbulent eddies. The resulting turbulence eddies can amplify the magnetic field. We propose that the strong radio emission from the radio rim is primarily due to this amplified magnetic field. In contrast, a CO cloud located in the south-west appears to lie in the foreground, as indicated by its low turbulence and the absence of shock deceleration.",

Horowitz High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th) The possibility of neutron decay into dark particles has been proposed as a way to resolve a growing discrepancy between two different measurements of the neutron lifetime. The most popular formulation is a dark sector consisting of a dark baryon $\\chi$ and a dark scalar $\\phi$, where a neutron in vacuum decays about 1% of the time via the channel $n\\rightarrow \\chi+\\phi$. In this work, we consider the effect of this additional neutron decay channel on transport in neutrons star mergers. We find that the neutron dark decay rate in medium is quite slow, and thus the dark baryons modify the dense matter equation of state in a way that decreases the Urca bulk viscosity by, at most, a factor of 2-3. However, if the neutron dark decay was to occur more rapidly, then the bulk viscosity at merger temperatures of tens of MeV would be strongly enhanced, potentially rapidly damping oscillations in merger environments and therefore providing a signature of slowly equilibrating matter in the merger.",

Zhang, the Einstein Probe collaborations High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Stars captured by black holes (BHs) can be tore apart by strong tidal force, producing electromagnetic flares. Some 100 tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been observed, involving invariably normal gaseous stars whose debris falls onto the BH fueling the flares over years. White dwarfs (WDs)-the most prevalent compact stars a million times denser and thus tougher than gaseous stars-can only be disrupted by intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) of 10^2-10^5 solar masses. WD-TDEs are predicted to generate more powerful and short-lived flares, but their evidence has been lacking. Here we report observations of a fast, luminous X-ray transient EP250702a. Its one-day-long peak showed strong recurrent flares extending to several tens of MeV in gamma-rays, indicating relativistic jet emission. The jet X-rays dropped sharply from exceeding 3 x 10^49 to around 10^44 erg/s within 20 days. These characteristics are inconsistent with any known transient phenomena other than a jetted-TDE evolving within a short timespan previously unseen-indicating the disruption of a white dwarf by an IMBH. At late times, a new soft component progressively dominates the X-ray spectrum, exhibiting extreme super-Eddington luminosity, possibly from an accretion disc. WD-TDEs open a new window to study elusive IMBHs and the otherwise invisible interior of degenerate stars.",

Distinguishing between the hadronic and leptonic origin of $\\gamma$-ray emission in Galactic sources remains challenging. Measurements of non-thermal X-ray spectra of these sources, which could originate from primary electrons in the leptonic scenario or secondary electrons/positrons in the hadronic scenario, have been suggested as an efficient way of discriminating between these scenarios. In this work, we investigate the morphology of the X-ray emission from secondary electrons/positrons. By calculating the surface brightness profile and the photon index profile of X-ray emission, we find that secondary electrons produce a distinctively flat X-ray surface brightness profile. Our results suggest that, in addition to the X-ray spectrum, the X-ray morphology is crucial to determine the radiation mechanism of ultrahigh-energy $\\gamma$-ray sources and help to identify sources of PeV cosmic rays.",

In the presence of dissipative/stochastic effects, the motion of the particle in the magnetic dipole field can be described by a generalized Langevin type equation, which generalizes the standard Lorentz force equation. We perform a detailed numerical analysis of the dynamical behavior of the particles in a magnetic dipolar field in the presence of dissipative and stochastic forces, as well as of the electromagnetic radiation patterns emitted during the motion. The effects of the dissipation coefficient and of the stochastic force on the particle motion and on the emitted electromagnetic power are investigated, and thus a full description of the spectrum of the magnetic dipole type electromagnetic radiation and of the physical properties of the motion is also obtained. The power spectral density of the emitted electromagnetic power is also obtained for each case, and, for all considered Störmer type models, it shows the presence of peaks in the radiation spectrum, corresponding to certain intervals of the frequency.",

EC-SNe are predicted to be the most likely short-lived and faint optical transients, and a small ejecta mass is expected during the collapse. This kind of SNe provide an alternative channel for producing isolated NSs and NS systems, especially for the formation of X-ray binaries and double NSs. However, there are still some uncertainties for the origin of EC-SNe. In this article, we review recent studies on the two classic progenitor channels of EC-SNe, i.e., the single star channel and the binary star channel. In the single star channel, EC-SNe can happen in super asymptotic giant branch stars or He stars, whereas in the binary star channel EC-SNe can occur in He stars in binaries (including He star+MS systems and NS+He star systems) or accretion-induced collapse in white dwarf binaries (including the single-degenerate scenario and the double-degenerate scenario). Recent progress on the two progenitor channels is discussed, including the initial parameter range for EC-SNe, the evolutionary paths to EC-SNe, related objects, and some observational constraints, etc. We also discuss the formation of double NSs through NS+He star binaries, in which the He star companion experiences an EC-SN. Research on EC-SNe is at a pivotal stage, with key theoretical uncertainties and observational challenges requiring integrated modeling and multi-wavelength observations for robust identification.",

Accepted by A&A Letter High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) CSS100217 is considered a peculiar tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate occurring in an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Unlike typical TDEs, where the post-flare luminosity is equal to that pre-flare, CSS100217 decayed to $\\sim$ 0.4 magnitudes fainter than its pre-flare V band level. In this manuscript, we propose an obscured TDE model to explain the light curve of CSS100217. Assuming that the time-dependent obscuration, caused by the TDE unbound stellar debris, or by nuclear clouds moving around the supermassive black hole (SMBH), follows a Weibull distribution, we find that the light curve of CSS100217 can be described by the tidal disruption of a $4.6_{-0.9}^{+0.9}{\\rm M_\\odot}$ main-sequence star by a $3.3_{-0.3}^{+0.3}\\times10^7{\\rm M_\\odot}$ black hole. The total energy of the event derived from our fit is $7.23\\times10^{53}$ ergs and about 1.38 ${\\rm M_\\odot}$ of debris mass is accreted by the central SMBH. The model indicates that the contribution of the host galaxy to the observed pre-flare optical luminosity is not-significant compared to that of the AGN, which is consistent with the results of the spectral analysis. These results suggest that obscuration may play an important role in explaining the unusual TDE-like variability observed in CSS100217.",

These sources are considered to be redback candidates based on their eclipsing variability, steep negative spectral indices, and potential Fermi $\\gamma$-ray associations, with GPM J1723-33 and GPM J1815-14 lying within a Fermi 95% error ellipse. Follow-up pulsation searches with MeerKAT confirmed pulsations from GPM J1723-33, while the non-detections of the other three are likely due to scattering by material ablated from their companion stars. We identify possible orbital periods by applying folding algorithms to the light curves and determine that all sources have short orbital periods (<24 hours), consistent with redback spider systems. Following up on the sources at multiple radio frequencies revealed that the sources exhibit frequency-dependent eclipses, with longer eclipses observed at lower frequencies. We place broad constraints on the eclipse medium, ruling out induced Compton scattering and cyclotron absorption. Three sources are spatially consistent with optical sources in the Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey imaging, which may contain the optical counterparts. Each field is affected by strong dust extinction, and follow-up with large telescopes is needed to identify the true counterparts. Identifying potential radio counterparts to four previously unassociated Fermi sources brings us closer to understanding the origin of the unexplained $\\gamma$-ray excess in the Galactic Centre.",

Gamma-ray detectors such as LHAASO and VERITAS have detected TeV emission in the vicinity of the pulsar. However, the derived SEDs from LHAASO WCDA and VERITAS show significant discrepancies, which could be due to a complicated energy-dependent morphology not accounted for in the spectral analysis, and different angular resolution of the two experiments.

We also find tentative PD variability in the 2--3 keV band. To interpret the time-averaged polarization, we build spectropolarimetric models by Monte Carlo radiation transfer simulation with column density distribution of thermal-radiative wind launched by X-ray irradiation of the outer disc under an axisymmetric geometry. The model combines boundary-layer emission, its disc reflection, and the disc continuum, each with its intrinsic polarization. Scattering of this composite spectrum in the wind reproduces both the observed PD and its increase with energy.

Originally submitted to ApJL on September 2, 2025. Comments welcome! High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) GRB 250702B/EP250702a is an interesting long-duration gamma-ray transient whose nature is in debate. To obtain a full picture in gamma-ray band, we implement a comprehensive targeted search of burst emission in a wide window of 30 days jointly with Insight-HXMT, GECAM and Fermi/GBM data within the ETJASMIN framework. In gamma-ray band, we find there is a 50-second precursor about 25 hours before the 4-hour main burst, which generally consists of 4 emission episodes. Remarkably, we find that the soft X-ray emission (after the main burst) decays as a power-law with start time aligning with the last episode of main emission and index of -5/3 perfectly consistent with the canonical prediction of fallback accretion. We conclude that the properties of precursor, main burst and the following soft X-ray emission strongly support the atypical collapsar Ultra-Long Gamma-Ray Burst (ULGRB) scenario rather than the Tidal Disruption Event (TDE), and all these gamma-ray and soft X-ray emission probably originate from relativistic jet whose luminosity is dominated by the fallback accretion rate during the death collapse of a supergiant star.",

The precise spatial and spectral measurements of diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission provide new avenues for unraveling this mystery. Based on 16 years of Fermi-LAT observations, we find that the diffuse gamma-ray spectral shapes are nearly identical for low energies (below a few GeV) but show significant dispersion at high energies (above a few GeV) across the Galactic disk. We further show that the diffuse emission can be decomposed into two components, a universal spectral component dominating at low energies which is consistent with the expectation from interactions of background cosmic rays and the interstellar matter, and a spatially variant component dominating at high energies which is likely due to local accelerators. These findings suggest that there is dual-origin of the Galactic diffuse emission, including the ``cosmic ray sea'' from efficient propagation of particles and the ``cosmic ray islands'' from inefficient propagation of particles, and thus shed new light on the understanding of the propagation models of Galactic cosmic rays.",

Ziqian Hua, Zhiyuan Li 10 pages, 3 figures, submitted to AAS Journals High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Swift J174610.4-290018, a peculiar transient X-ray source originally discovered by the Swift satellite in February 2024 at the onset of its outburst, recently attracted intentional or coincident follow-up X-ray observations using Swift, NuSTAR and Chandra. We have performed a comprehensive analysis of the relevant X-ray data to investigate the spectral and temporal properties of this source between October 2000 and July 2024. Archival Chandra data reveal a plausible additional outburst in 2005, followed by a quiescent state in the next $\\sim$19 years. The X-ray spectra in both the quiescent and outburst phases are consistent with a thermal plasma spectrum with relatively high temperatures ($\\sim$10 keV) and prominent emission lines from both neutral and highly-ionized iron. A previously proposed low-mass X-ray binary/accretion disk corona scenario for Swift J174610, based on XRISM observations near the peak of the 2024 outburst, is examined against the newly derived X-ray properties and is disfavored, in particular due to its difficulty in explaining the quiescent state spectrum. Instead, we suggest a symbiotic binary/recurrent nova scenario, which gains support from many of the observed X-ray properties of Swift J174610 and a close comparison with the famous Galactic recurrent nova RS Oph. If confirmed, Swift J174610 would represent the first nova detected in the Galactic center, offering new insights into the otherwise elusive population of massive white dwarfs as well as wide binaries in the close vicinity of Sgr A*. Our findings call for multi-wavelength follow-up observations for this highly unusual X-ray source.",

We detect 44 H$_2$ lines, including bright pure rotational lines (S(1)-S(18)) and rovibrational lines up to $\\nu=2$, probing a wide range of excitation conditions. Excitation diagrams show that rotational lines follow a power-law temperature distribution with an exponential cutoff, consistent with heating by low-velocity shocks. H$_2$ rovibrational lines deviate from thermal models primarily because of sub-thermal excitation at low density. Additionally, there may be a 10% contribution by AGN X-ray heating in the nucleus. The dust lanes associated with the spiral inflow appear dynamically undisturbed but show signs of shock heating, while the inner $\\sim$200 pc exhibits turbulent kinematics produced by outflowing molecular gas. These results reveal the subtle yet measurable impact of LLAGN feedback on the interstellar medium, demonstrating that even weak, vertically oriented jets and low radiative accretion rates can perturb molecular gas and regulate nuclear reservoirs.

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), with its unprecedented depth and cadence, will detect thousands of TDEs, motivating the need for robust photometric classifiers capable of efficiently distinguishing these events from other extragalactic transients. We aim to develop and validate a machine learning pipeline for photometric TDE identification in LSST-scale datasets. Our classifier is designed to provide high precision and recall, enabling the construction of reliable TDE catalogs for multi-messenger follow-up and statistical studies. Using the second Extended LSST Astronomical Time Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC2) dataset, we fit Gaussian Processes (GP) to light curves for feature extraction (e.g., color, rise/fade times, GP length scales). We then train and tune boosted decision-tree models (XGBoost) with a custom scoring function emphasizing high-precision recovery of TDEs. Our pipeline is tested on a diverse simulation of transient and variable events, including supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and superluminous supernovae. We achieve high precision (up to 95%) while maintaining competitive recall (about 72%) for TDEs, with minimal contamination from non-TDE classes. Key predictive features include post-peak colors and GP hyperparameters, reflecting characteristic timescales and spectral behaviors of TDEs. Our photometric classifier provides a practical and scalable approach to identifying TDEs in forthcoming LSST data. By capturing essential color and temporal properties through GP-based feature extraction, it enables efficient construction of clean TDE candidate samples.",

However, it has been pointed out that reflections of sunlight from Earth-orbiting objects can also produce second-timescale ``glints.'' We conducted wide-field observations at 2 frames per second using Tomo-e Gozen on the 1.05 m Kiso Schmidt telescope. We identified 1554 point-source glints that appeared in only one frame (0.5 sec). Their brightness ranges from 11 to 16 mag, with fainter glints being more numerous. These glints are likely caused by satellites and space debris in high-altitude orbits such as the geosynchronous Earth orbit or highly elliptical orbits. Many glints brighter than 14 mag are associated with known satellites or debris with large apogees ($>$ 30,000 km). In contrast, most fainter glints are not associated with cataloged objects and may be due to debris with sizes of 0.3--1 m. The event rate of second-timescale glints is estimated to be $4.7 \\pm 0.2\\ {\\rm deg^{-2}\\ hr^{-1}}$ (average) and $9.0 \\pm 0.3\\ {\\rm deg^{-2}\\ hr^{-1}}$ (near the equator) at 15.5 mag. Our results demonstrate that high-altitude debris can represent a significant foreground in searches for second-timescale optical transients. They also imply that deep surveys such as Rubin/LSST will detect many of these glints in single-exposure images.",

We use 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of magnetized plasmas subject to continuous shear-driven magnetic amplification to investigate whether electron temperature anisotropy instabilities in above-the-loop-top (ALT) regions can account for this diversity. We explore how the resulting spectra depend on key plasma parameters: the initial electron temperature $T_e$ and the initial ratio of electron cyclotron to plasma frequencies, $f_e = \\omega_{ce}/\\omega_{pe}$. In our simulations, the adiabatic evolution of the plasma generates electron temperature anisotropy with the electron temperature perpendicular to the magnetic field being larger than the parallel temperature. This eventually drives electromagnetic instabilities capable of scattering and accelerating electrons. The simulations consistently produce nonthermal tails in the electron spectra whose hardness increases with the initial value of $f_e$, while depending only weakly on $T_e$. For runs in which $f_e \\lesssim 1.2$, the spectra exhibit double power-law shapes with downward (knee-like) breaks, and the electron scattering is dominated by OQES modes. In runs with $f_e\\gtrsim 1.5$, PEMZ modes dominate and produce harder double power-law spectra with upward (elbow-like) breaks. Cases that include the $f_e\\sim 1.2-1.5$ transition yield nearly single power-laws that end with bump-like breaks. Our results support the role of temperature anisotropy instabilities in accelerating electrons in ALT regions, offering a promising framework to help explain the wide range of nonthermal electron spectra reported in solar flare observations.",

Malanchev main: 12 pages with 11 figures; appendix: 5 pages with 3 figures; figures have grids High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We studied the thermal stability of non-self-gravitating turbulent $\\alpha$-discs around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) to test a new type of high-amplitude galactic nucleus flares. By calculating the disc structures, we computed the critical points of equilibrium curves for discs around SMBHs, which cover a wide range of accretion rates and resemble the shape $\\xi$. We find that a transition of a disc ring from a recombined cold state to a hot, fully ionised, advection dominated, geometrically thick state is possible. Such a transition can trigger a giant flare for SMBHs with masses $\\sim 10^6-10^8\\, M_\\odot$ if the prior geometrically thin and optically thick disc surrounded a central radiatively inefficient accretion flow. An increase in the viscosity parameter $\\alpha$ is a necessary condition for this scenario. This increase may be related to the fact that the magnetic Prandtl number increases and exceeds 1 during ionisation. When self-gravity effects in the disc are negligible, the duration and power of the flare exhibit a positive correlation with the prior truncation radius of the geometrically thin disc. According to our estimates, the mass of about $\\sim 4-3000\\, M_\\odot$ can be involved in the giant flare lasting 1 to 400 years if the flare is triggered somewhere between $60$ and $600$ gravitational radii from the SMBH of $10^7\\, M_\\odot$. The accretion rate on the SMBH peaks about 10 times faster at the potentially super-Eddington level. An optically thick outflow leads to anisotropy of the emission. At the beginning of the giant flare, the region near the truncation radius is heated to $\\sim 10^5\\,$K, and its UV/optical luminosity is at least $\\sim 0.3-4 \\,L_\\mathrm{Edd}$ depending on the SMBH mass. The sudden heating of a cold disc around a SMBH can trigger a massive outburst, similar in appearance to what is proposed to occur after a tidal disruption event.",

This distance implies a natal kick velocity of $190 \\pm 30 \\, {\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ and therefore an asymmetrical supernova explosion within the Galactic disk as the expected birth mechanism. A lower distance is implied if the donor star has instead lost significant mass during the binary evolution. Hence, more accurate measurements of the binary inclination angle or donor star rotational broadening from future observations would help to better constrain the distance.",

Despite numerous radiative and geometric models proposed so far, a comprehensive explanation of the observed properties of these variability components remains elusive. This study systematically examines kHz QPOs, their variability, and their connection to spectral properties in $4U 1636-536$ using AstroSat data. Our analysis tracks the source transition from hard to soft states in the hardness-intensity diagram. Broad spectral analysis (0.7-25 keV) using SXT and LAXPC data indicates a spectrum shaped by reflection from a thermal corona, with contributions from boundary layer emission and a soft disk component. We find significant changes in optical depth, blackbody temperature, and inner disk temperature that likely drive state transitions. Power density spectra reveal three variability types: a low frequency QPO (LFQPOs) (~30 Hz), and two simultaneous kHz QPOs. The LFQPOs and the upper kHz QPOs appear more prominently in soft spectral states. The presence of LFQPOs and twin kHz QPOs in soft spectral states enable us to estimate the neutron star mass at (2.37 $\\pm$ 0.02) $M_\\odot$ using the relativistic precession model (RPM). Additionally, time-lag and root mean square (rms) analysis provide insights into the size of the corona and the radiative origin of these variability components.",

We find a wide diversity of time-frequency morphology and polarisation properties broadly consistent with those of currently known non-repeating FRBs. The high S/N and fine time-resolution of our data however reveals a wealth of new information. Key results include (i) the distribution of scattering timescales, ${\\tau}_{obs}$, is limited purely by instrumental effects, with no downturn at high ${\\tau}_{obs}$ as expected from a log-normal distribution; (ii) for the 29 FRBs with known redshift, there is no detectable correlation between $\\tau_{obs}$ and dispersion measure (DM) fluctuations about the Macquart relation, in contrast to expectations from pulsar scattering-DM relations; (iii) all FRBs probably have multiple components, and at least a large fraction have variable PA, the identification of which is limited by scattering; (iv) at least half of all FRBs exhibit PA microstructure at 200 ${\\mu}s$-200 ns timescales, with behaviour most closely resembling a sub-category of Crab main pulses; (v) that there is a break in the FRB circular polarisation distribution at Stokes V $\\gtrsim$ 20%, which is suggestive of a discrete sub-population.",

This event is accompanied by the release of a second neutrino burst. Unlike the first stellar core bounce neutrino burst which consists exclusively of electron neutrinos, the second burst is dominated by electron antineutrinos. Such a condition makes QCD supernovae an ideal site for the occurrence of fast neutrino flavor conversion (FFC), which can lead to rapid flavor equilibration and significantly impact the related neutrino signal. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of the conditions for fast flavor instability (FFI) around and after the second neutrino burst in QCD phase transition supernova models launched from 25~$M_\\odot$ and 40~$M_\\odot$ progenitor models. We evaluate the relevant instability criteria and find two major phases of FFC. The first phase is closely associated with the collapse and the rapidly expanding shock wave, which is a direct consequence of the proto-neutron star collapse due to the phase transition. The second phase takes place a few milliseconds later when electron degeneracy is restored near the proto-neutron star surface. We also characterize the growth rate of FFI and estimate its impact on the evolution of the neutrino flavor content. The potential observational consequences on neutrino signals are evaluated by comparing a scenario assuming complete flavor equipartition with other scenarios without FFC. Finally, we investigate how FFC may influences $r$-process nucleosynthesis associated with QCD phase transition driven supernova explosions.",

Accepted by MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax) are one of the most common subclasses of thermonuclear supernova and yet their sample size, particularly those observed shortly after explosion, remains relatively small. In this paper we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of two SNe Iax discovered shortly after explosion, SN 2024bfu and SN 2025qe. Both SNe were observed by multiple all-sky surveys, enabling tight constraints on the moment of first light and the shape of the early light curve. Our observations of SN 2025qe begin <2d after the estimated time of first light and represent some of the earliest observations of any SN Iax. Spectra show features consistent with carbon absorption throughout the evolution of SN 2025qe, potentially indicating the presence of unburned material throughout the ejecta. We gather a sample of SNe Iax observed by ATLAS, GOTO, and ZTF shortly after explosion and measure their rise times and early light curve power-law rise indices. We compare our results to a sample of normal SNe Ia and find indications that SNe Iax show systematically shorter rise times, consistent with previous work. We also find some indication that SNe Iax show systematically lower rise indices than normal SNe Ia. The low rise indices observed among SNe Iax are qualitatively consistent with extended $^{56}$Ni distributions and more thoroughly-mixed ejecta compared to normal SNe Ia, similar to predictions from pure deflagration explosions.",

The search for sources of neutral particles offers distinct advantages over searching for sources of charged particles, as the former traverse cosmic distances undeflected by magnetic fields. While no cosmic-ray photons exceeding $10^{17}$ eV have been definitively detected, identifying the clustering of events in cosmic-ray data would provide compelling evidence for their existence. We compare two analysis methods for detecting direction-time clustering in UHE extensive air showers: an approach in which one examines multiplets, and the stacking method, in which one analyzes sets of doublets that are not necessarily consecutive, thus making it sensitive to multiple flares. Both techniques combine time-clustering algorithms with unbinned likelihood study. Background events (initiated by hadrons) can be more efficiently distinguished from photon-induced events (signals) by using a photon tag that employs probability distribution functions to classify each event as more likely to be initiated by either a photon or a hadron. We demonstrate that these methods can effectively distinguish between events initiated by photons and those initiated by hadrons (background), and can accurately reproduce both the number of photon events within flares and their duration. We calculate the discovery potentials, i.e., the number of events required to identify a photon flare. The methods discussed can be used to search for cosmic ray sources and/or improve limits on the fluxes of UHE photons.",

Code available at this https URL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous astrophysical transients, known to be associated with core collapse of massive stars or mergers of two compact objects such as two neutron stars. They are followed by multi-wavelength afterglow emission originating from the deceleration of the relativistic jets by the ambient medium. The study of afterglow emission offers crucial insights into the physics of relativistic shocks, the properties of the circumburst environment, the physical and geometrical structure of relativistic jets, as well as the viewing geometry of the observer. We present {\\tt VegasAfterglow}, a newly developed, high-performance C++ framework designed for modeling GRB afterglows with flexibility and computational efficiency as key features of design. The framework self-consistently solves forward and reverse shock dynamics and calculates synchrotron (including self-absorption or all spectral regimes) and inverse Compton radiation (including Klein-Nishina corrections); it can handle arbitrary user-defined ambient density profiles, central engine activity histories, viewing angles, and the jet structures of energy, Lorentz factor, and magnetization profiles. It supports both relativistic and non-relativistic regimes and includes lateral jet spreading effects. In this paper, we describe the numerical implementation of the framework and assess its computational performance. Our results demonstrate that {\\tt VegasAfterglow} is well-suited for interpreting current and future multi-wavelength observations in the era of multi-messenger astronomy.",

A detailed study of the temporal properties reveals the appearance of an `unknown' variability class ($\\tau$) during $\\rho \\rightarrow \\kappa$ class transition of the source. This new `unknown' class ($\\tau$) is characterized by the irregular repetition of low count `dips' along with the adjacent `flare' like features in between two successive steady count rate durations, resulting in uniform `$C$' shaped distribution in the color-color diagram. A detailed comparative study of the variability properties between the $\\tau$ class and other known variability classes of GRS $1915+105$ indicates it as a distinct variability class of the source. Further, we find evidence of the presence of possible HFQPO features at $\\sim 71$ Hz with quality factor $\\sim 13$, rms amplitude $\\sim 4.69\\%$, and significance $3\\sigma$, respectively. In addition, a harmonic-like feature at $\\sim 152$ Hz is also seen with quality factor $\\sim 21$, rms amplitude $\\sim 5.75\\%$ and significance $\\sim 4.7\\sigma$. The energy-dependent power spectral study reveals that the fundamental HFQPO and its harmonic are present in $3-15$ keV and $3-6$ keV energy ranges, respectively. Moreover, the wide-band ($0.7-50$ keV) spectral modelling comprising of thermal Comptonization component indicates the presence of a cool ($kT_{\\rm e}\\sim 1.7$ keV) and optically thick (optical depth $\\sim 14$) Comptonizing `corona', which seems to be responsible in regulating the HFQPO features in GRS $1915$+$105$.

Shappee, J. P. Anderson, J. F. Beacom, Subo Dong, K. Z. Stanek, T. A. Thompson 12 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication at A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The volumetric rates and luminosity functions (LFs) of core-collapse supernovae (ccSN) and their subtypes are important for understanding the cosmic history of star formation and the buildup of ccSN products. To estimate these rates, we use data of nearby ccSNe discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) from 2014--2017, when all observations were made in the $V$-band. The sample is composed of 174 discovered or recovered events, with high spectroscopic completeness from followup observations. This allows us to obtain a statistically precise and systematically robust estimate of nearby rates for ccSNe and their subtypes. The volumetric rates are estimated by correcting the observed number of events for the survey completeness, which was estimated through injection recovery simulations using ccSN light curves. We find a total volumetric rate for ccSNe of $7.0^{+1.0}_{-0.9} \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\textrm{yr}^{-1} \\ \\textrm{Mpc}^{-3} \\ h^{3}_{70}$, at a median redshift of 0.0149, for absolute magnitudes at peak $M_{V,peak} \\leq -14$ mag. This result is in agreement with previous local volumetric rates. We obtain volumetric rates for the different ccSN subtypes (II, IIn, IIb, Ib, Ic, Ibn, and Ic-BL), and find that the relative fractions of Type II, stripped-envelope, and interacting ccSNe are $63.2\\%$, $32.3\\%$, and $4.4\\%$, respectively. We also estimate a volumetric rate for superluminous SNe of $1.5^{+4.4}_{-1.1} \\ \\textrm{yr}^{-1} \\ \\textrm{Gpc}^{-3} \\ h^{3}_{70}$, corresponding to a fraction of $0.002\\%$ of the total ccSN rate. We produce intrinsic $V$-band LFs of ccSNe and their subtypes, and show that ccSN rates steadily decline for increasing luminosities. We further investigate the specific ccSN rate as a function of their host galaxy stellar mass, and find that the rate decreases with increasing stellar mass, with significantly higher rates at lower mass galaxies.",

Past X-ray observations occurred at the wrong phase of the companion's orbit for optimal detection prospects and/or lacked the deep exposure required to constrain the typical X-ray luminosities of YSOs. In our 41.85 ks exposure with Chandra, we do not detect an X-ray source at the position of Betelgeuse. For an estimated hydrogen column density $N_H$$=$$6\\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, we place a limit on the X-ray luminosity of $L_X$$\\lesssim$$2\\times10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\\lesssim$$4.7\\times10^{-4}L_\\odot$) in $0.5$$-$$8$ keV for a 10 MK plasma temperature spectral model, or $L_X$$\\lesssim$$5\\times10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\\lesssim$$1.2\\times10^{-4}L_\\odot$) for an absorbed power law with photon index $\\Gamma$$=$$2$. These limits robustly exclude an accreting compact object (white dwarf or neutron star) as the companion. Solar mass YSOs with an age similar to Betelgeuse ($\\sim$10 Myr) display a range of X-ray luminosities ($10^{28-32}$ erg s$^{-1}$), and we can place upper bounds within this range for most absorbing columns. Based on these considerations, we conclude that the companion to Betelgeuse is likely a low-mass YSO.",

Published in ApJ Peter Scherbak et al 2025 ApJ 990 172 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) High rates of stable mass transfer likely occur for some binary star systems, but the resulting flow of mass and angular momentum (AM) is unclear. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of a polytropic donor star and a point mass secondary to determine the mass, AM, and velocity of gas that escapes the system, and the dependence on binary parameters such as mass ratio. The simulations use an adiabatic equation of state and do not include any radiative cooling or irradiation of the outflow. Mass transfer is initiated by injecting heat into the stellar envelope, causing it to gradually inflate and overflow its Roche lobe. The transferred mass flows into an accretion disk, but soon begins to escape through the outer Lagrange point (L2), with a lesser amount escaping through the L3 point. This creates an equatorially concentrated circumbinary outflow with an opening angle of 10 to 30 degrees with a wind-like density profile $\\rho \\propto r^{-2}$. We find that the ratios of the specific AM of the outflowing gas over that of the L2 point are approximately {0.95, 0.9, 0.8, 0.65} for binary mass ratios $q$ (accretor/donor) of {0.25, 0.5, 1, 2}. The asymptotic radial velocity of the outflowing gas, in units of the binary orbital velocity, is approximately 0.1 to 0.2 for the same mass ratios, except for $q=0.25$ where it might be higher. This outflow, if ultimately unbound from the binary, may be a source of circumstellar material that will interact with ejecta from a subsequent supernova or stellar merger.",

Revision includes changes suggested by the referee Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present panchromatic 0.4-21 microns observations of the nearby (about 7.2 Mpc) Type II supernova 2024ggi, obtained during the plateau phase at about 55 d past explosion. Our dataset includes JWST spectra spanning 1.7-14 microns, MIR imaging at 7.7 and 21 microns, and near-simultaneous ground-based optical and NIR spectra covering 0.32-1.8 microns. The NIR and MIR spectral features of SN 2024ggi are dominated by HI emission. We present line IDs and a toy PHOENIX/1D model that reproduces the observations well, especially the continuum redward of 0.9 microns We compare SN 2024ggi to SN 2022acko and SN 2023ixf, two other Type II supernovae that were also observed by JWST, and highlight key similarities and differences in their spectral features. No evidence for a MIR excess or dust is found at these epochs, with the model matching the observed flux out to 21 microns. We discuss the model's shortcomings, focusing on the density profile, which suppresses line blanketing and produces features in the optical that are too narrow. Our results show the power of panchromatic studies in both exploring the nature of the SN ejecta and constraining detailed models of SNe.",

Méndez 12 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Frontiers Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) For decades, the theoretical understanding of planetary nebulae (PNe) has remained in tension with the observed universal bright-end cutoff of the PN luminosity function (PNLF). While the brightest younger PN populations are expected to be brighter in their [OIII] emission than observed, recent studies have proposed circumnebular extinction to be a key ingredient for bringing their brightness down to the observed bright end. In this work we use the recently introduced PICS (PNe In Cosmological Simulations) framework to investigate the impact of different circumnebular extinction treatments on the modeled PNe and their PNLF for a large range of stellar ages and metallicities. We test how different slopes in the observed relation of extinction versus central star mass modify the bright-end cutoffs of the PNLF, finding that steeper slopes lead to large changes for young stellar populations. In contrast, the differences for older PNe are much smaller. However, for individual PNe, the extinctions observed in nearby galaxies appear to be much higher than the models predict, showing that improvements on both the modeling and observational sides are needed to gain a better understanding of the brightest and strongly extincted PNe. These findings further advance the theoretical foundation for interpreting observed extragalactic PN populations coming from more complex composite stellar populations in the future.",

Kimmig, Jan-Niklas Pippert, Elisabeth Sola, Klaus Dolag 22 pages, 18 figures, submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Stellar shells and streams are remnants of satellite galaxies visible around galaxies. Advances in low-surface-brightness observations and increasing resolution of cosmological simulations now allow investigating the properties and origin of these features. The metallicity, age, and velocity dispersion of shells and streams are investigated to infer their progenitor galaxies properties. We employed the hydrodynamical cosmological simulations Magneticum Pathfinder to extract these properties and identify the progenitors of the shells and streams. We compared to observational results from surveys and individual galaxies, matching and testing the methodology used in observations. Mock observations of shells and streams agree well with observational data regarding their morphology and spatial distribution. We find that both types of features are associated with localized depressions in stellar velocity dispersion compared to the surrounding regions. They are not as clearly distinct in metallicity and ages, though overall shells and more metal rich and streams are younger. We confirm results from idealized models that shells form commonly from radial major mergers but also through minor mergers, while streams usually form from minor mergers on circular orbits. We do not find the widths of streams to correlate with the half-mass radii of their progenitors, but the progenitors follow the mass-metallicity relation. On average, the masses measured for shells and streams approximately corresponds to 20% of the progenitor mass. We introduce a class of star-forming streams, which originate from in-situ star formation rather than the disruption of a satellite galaxy. Measuring stellar population properties of shells and streams provides the means to reconstruct the progenitor properties, and especially distinguish those streams that are not made through the disruption of a galaxy but formed in-situ.",

Demianenko 17 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables, submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Giant low-surface-brightness disk galaxies (gLSBGs) are rare objects with disk radii up-to 160 kpc and dynamical masses of an order of up to 10$^{12}$ $M_{\\odot}$. Their very existence challenges currently accepted theories of galaxy formation and evolution, as it is difficult to build such large, dynamically cold disks through mergers without destroying them. We present deep MUSE mosaic observations of two nearby gLSBGs with compact elliptical satellites: UGC 1382, which hosts a globally counter-rotating gaseous disk, and AGC 192040, which does not. We analyze properties of ionized gas and present spatially resolved kinematics and metallicity maps; as well as stellar population analysis for the central regions of the galaxies. The radial gradients of gas-phase metallicities are flat for both galaxies. Our estimates of the effective oxygen yield suggest 'passive' gas in the outskirts of both stellar systems that is not involved in star formation. Our observational data indicate that both galaxies experienced mergers several Gyrs ago. However, the scenarios of formation of giant disks appear to be slightly different for these two systems. For AGC 192040 we propose the gas accretion from the filament followed by the intermediate-mass ratio merger with the companion on a prograde orbit. For UGC 1382 multiple gas-rich mergers with companions on retrograde orbits are preferred by the data.",

C. de los Reyes, Imad Pasha, Nitya Kallivayalil, Ethan O. Nadler, Erik J. Tollerud, Yunchong Wang, Benjamin Weiner, John F. Wu Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate how Milky Way-like environments influence the sizes and structural properties of low-mass galaxies by comparing satellites of Milky Way analogs from the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey with two control samples: an environmentally agnostic population from the SAGA background (SAGAbg) sample and isolated galaxies from the SDSS NASA-Sloan Atlas. All sizes and structural parameters are measured uniformly using pysersic to ensure consistency across samples. We find the half-light sizes of SAGA satellites are systematically larger than those of isolated galaxies, with the magnitude of the offset ranging from 0.05 to 0.12 dex (10-24%) depending on the comparison sample and completeness cuts. This corresponds to physical size differences between 85-200 pc at 10^7.5 solar masses and 220-960 pc at 10^10 solar masses. This offset persists among star-forming galaxies, suggesting that environment can influence the structure of low-mass galaxies even before it impacts quenching. The intrinsic scatter in the size-mass relation is lower for SAGA satellites than isolated galaxies, and the Sérsic index distributions of satellites and isolated galaxies are similar. In comparison to star-forming satellites, quenched SAGA satellites have a slightly shallower size-mass relation and rounder morphologies at low-mass, suggesting that quenching is accompanied by structural transformation and that the processes responsible differ between low- and high-mass satellites. Our results show that environmental processes can imprint measurable structural differences on satellites in Milky Way-mass halos.",

Spatially resolving these components provides crucial insights into a galaxy's mass assembly history. We aim to predict the spatial distribution of ex-situ stellar mass fraction in MaNGA galaxies, and to identify distinct assembly histories based on the radial gradients of these predictions in the central regions. We employ a diffusion model trained on mock MaNGA analogs (MaNGIA), derived from the TNG50 cosmological simulation. The model learns to predict the posterior distribution of resolved ex-situ stellar mass fraction maps, conditioned on stellar mass density, velocity, and velocity dispersion gradient maps. After validating the model on an unseen test set from MaNGIA, we apply it to MaNGA galaxies to infer the spatially-resolved distribution of their ex-situ stellar mass fractions - i.e. the fraction of stellar mass in each spaxel originating from mergers. We identify four broad categories of ex-situ mass distributions: flat gradient, in-situ dominated; flat gradient, ex-situ dominated; positive gradient; and negative gradient. The vast majority of MaNGA galaxies fall in the first category - flat gradients with low ex-situ fractions - confirming that in-situ star formation is the main assembly driver for low- to intermediate-mass galaxies. At high stellar masses, the ex-situ maps are more diverse, highlighting the key role of mergers in building the most massive systems. Ex-situ mass distributions correlate with morphology, star-formation activity, stellar kinematics, and environment, indicating that accretion history is a primary factor shaping massive galaxies. Finally, by tracing their assembly histories in TNG50, we link each class to distinct merger scenarios, ranging from secular evolution to merger-dominated growth.",

FU Orionis objects are a specific class of young stellar object notable for their extremely high disk-to-star accretion rates. We use parallax and proper motion information from the Gaia astrometric survey to study five known FU Ori stars towards the Cygnus clouds, in the distance range ~500-900 parsecs, and seek evidence of their kinematic association with proximal stellar groups or clusters. We develop multiple search criteria within the Gaia datasets to look for nearby stellar aggregates and to reliably isolate their likely member stars. We show that V1057 Cygni and HBC 722 are kinematically consistent with the 3D locations as well as the inferred proper motion fields of the North America Nebula cluster. We show a similar association of V1515 Cygni with NGC 6914 in the Cygnus-X region, and of V2494 Cygni with stars in the dark cloud LDN 1003 and Braid Nebula. Further, we find that V1735 Cygni is consistent in both position and proper motion with the streamer structure of IC 5146, and we trace the streamer's similar proper motions to the main cluster. Color-magnitude diagrams of all identified clusters show the presence of pre-main-sequence populations, strengthening the likelihood of a physical association between the young FU Ori stars and their respective nearby clusters.",

In this study, we apply a neural network-based approach that achieves high mass precision without several limitations that have affected past approaches; for example, we do not assume dynamical equilibrium, nor do we assume that neighboring galaxies are bound satellites. Additionally, this method works for a broad mass range, including for halos that differ significantly from the Milky Way. Our model relies solely on observable dynamical quantities, such as satellite orbits, distances to larger nearby halos, and the maximum circular velocity of the most massive satellite. In this paper, we measure the halo mass of the Milky Way to be $\\log_{10} M_\\mathrm{vir}/\\Msun = 12.20^{+0.163}_{-0.138}$. Future studies in this series will extend this methodology to estimate the dark matter halo mass of M31, and develop new neural networks to infer additional halo properties including concentration, assembly history, and spin axis.",

Berek, Katherine Myers 24 pages, 15 figures, submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate the resolved properties of star-forming clumps and their host galaxies at $0.5<z<5$ in the JWST CANUCS fields. We find that the fraction of clumpy galaxies peaks near $z\\sim2$ for galaxies with masses of $\\log(M_{g,*}/M_\\odot)\\geq10$, while galaxies with masses of $8.5 \\leq \\log(M_{g,*}/M_\\odot) < 10$ show lower clumpy fractions with little redshift evolution. We identify and measure individual clump masses, finding that the aggregated clump stellar mass function (cSMF) follows a power-law slope of $\\alpha = -2$ across all redshift bins, broadly consistent with \\textit{in-situ} clump formation. However, when split by galaxy masses, the cSMF is found to be flatter ($\\alpha\\sim-1.6$) for massive galaxies and steeper ($\\alpha\\sim-2.3$) for lower mass galaxies, with little redshift evolution in both cases. We explore how different formation mechanisms and disruptive processes affect the shape of the clump mass function. In particular, we find that the cSMF slope is flatter with increasing gas fractions in younger clump populations ($<300$ Myr old), suggesting that higher gas availability leads to more massive clumps forming at the time of formation. Alternatively, many high-redshift galaxies in the sample have disturbed morphologies and simulations show that clumps of \\textit{ex-situ} origins can flatten the cSMF slope. We also investigate the evolution of clump populations, where we find the cSMF slope become flatter as clumps evolve and age. We interpret this as an indication of the long-term survivability of massive clumps, with feedback mechanisms preferentially disrupting low-mass clumps. Overall, the galaxy-mass dependent cSMF and age distribution point to a complex history for clumps, involving different and competing mechanisms for their formation and destruction.",

The shape of the line profile then encodes information on the dynamics of the collapse. There exist well-established observational techniques to estimate infall velocities from these profiles, but these have historically been calibrated on constant-velocity slab models, whereas more realistic simulations of gravitational collapse produce highly non-uniform radial velocity profiles. We produce synthetic line observations of a simulated collapsing prestellar core, including a treatment of the time-dependent chemical evolution. Applying observational techniques to the synthetic line profiles, we find that the estimated infall velocities are significantly and systematically lower than the mass-weighted infall velocities from the simulation. This is primarily because the self-absorption features tend to originate from the outer regions of the core, well beyond the location of the peak infall velocity. Velocities and mass accretion rates measured via these techniques are likely to underestimate the true values.",

Studies toward the Galactic bulge are complicated by the large and variable extinction along the line of sight. We measure the near-infrared $A_{K_S}$ extinction and $E(H-K_S)$ reddening in this region using $H$- and $K$-band photometry obtained with the 2017 UKIRT microlensing survey. We fit the apparent magnitude and color distribution of bright giants in the bulge to recover the apparent magnitude and color of Red Clump stars, which are known to be standard candles and crayons.

We find that a constant, standard extinction law is a poor representation of the relationship between the extinction and reddening we measure in fields of different latitudes.

Zheng 26 pages, 24 figures, accepted for publication in PASA Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The Hector Galaxy Survey is a new optical integral field spectroscopy (IFS) survey currently using the AAT to observe up to 15,000 galaxies at low redshift ($z < 0.1$). The Hector instrument employs 21 optical fibre bundles feeding into two double-beam spectrographs to enable wide-field multi-object IFS observations of galaxies. To efficiently process the survey data, we adopt the data reduction pipeline developed for the SAMI Galaxy Survey, with significant updates to accommodate Hector's dual-spectrograph system. These enhancements address key differences in spectral resolution and other instrumental characteristics relative to SAMI, and are specifically optimised for Hector's unique configuration. We introduce a two-dimensional arc fitting approach that reduces the RMS velocity scatter by a factor of 1.2--3.4 compared to fitting arc lines independently for each fibre. The pipeline also incorporates detailed modelling of chromatic optical distortion in the wide-field corrector, to account for wavelength-dependent spatial shifts across the focal plane. We assess data quality through a series of validation tests, including wavelength solution accuracy, spectral resolution, throughput characterisation, astrometric precision, sky subtraction residuals, and flux calibration stability (4\\% systematic offset when compared to Legacy Survey fluxes). We demonstrate that Hector delivers high-fidelity, science-ready datasets, supporting robust measurements of galaxy kinematics, stellar populations, and emission-line properties, and provide examples. Additionally, we address systematic uncertainties identified during the data processing and propose future improvements to enhance the precision and reliability of upcoming data releases. This work establishes a robust data reduction framework for Hector, delivering high-quality data products that support a broad range of extragalactic studies.",

This paper presents polarization measurements at 214 $\\mu$m toward ten filamentary candidate ``bones\" in the Milky Way using the High-resolution Airborne Wide-band Camera (HAWC+) on the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). These data were taken as part of the Filaments Extremely Long and Dark: A Magnetic Polarization Survey (FIELDMAPS) and represent the first study to resolve the magnetic field in spiral arms at parsec scales. We describe the complex yet well-defined polarization structure of all ten candidate bones, and we find a mean difference and standard deviation of $-74^{\\circ} \\pm 32^{\\circ}$ between their filament axis and the plane-of-sky magnetic field, closer to a field perpendicular to their length rather than parallel. By contrast, the 850 $\\mu$m polarization data from \\textit{Planck} on scales greater than 10 pc show a nearly parallel mean difference of $3^{\\circ} \\pm 21^{\\circ}$. These findings provide further evidence that magnetic fields can change orientation at the scale of dense molecular clouds, even along spiral arms. Finally, we use a power law to fit the dust polarization fraction as a function of total intensity on a cloud-by-cloud basis and find indices between $-0.6$ and $-0.9$, with a mean and standard deviation of $-0.7 \\pm 0.1$. The polarization, dust temperature, and column density data presented in this work are publicly available online.",

Sánchez-Monge 23 pages, 14 figures; accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The outer Galaxy is characterized by a lower metallicity than regions near the Sun, suggesting differences in the formation and survival of molecules in star-forming regions. To understand chemical evolution across the Milky Way, deriving molecular abundances in star-forming regions in the outer Galaxy is essential for refining models of sub-Solar metallicity environments. We analyzed IRAM 30m observations at 3 and 2 mm toward 35 sources at Galactocentric distances of 9$-$24 kpc, within the \"CHEMical complexity in star-forming regions of the outer Galaxy\" (CHEMOUT) project. We focused on species with the highest detection rates (i.e., HCN, HCO$^+$, c-C$_3$H$_2$, H$^{13}$CO$^+$, HCO, SO) and searched for trends in column densities, abundances, and line widths with Galactocentric distance. Abundances for H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH were updated using H$_2$ column densities from new NIKA2 dust maps. Fractional abundances relative to H$_2$ of most species (HCN, HCO$^+$, c-C$_3$H$_2$, HCO, H$_2$CO, CH$_3$OH) scale at most with the elemental carbon abundance ([C/H]) up to $\\sim$24 kpc. SO shows a steeper gradient than sulfur abundance ([S/H]), while H$^{13}$CO$^+$ shows a shallower gradient than [$^{13}$C/H]. Gas turbulence, inferred from line widths, decreases with Galactocentric distance, suggesting a more quiescent environment in the outer Galaxy with respect to the inner Galaxy. In the outer Galaxy, the formation efficiency of most molecules, following the parent element availability, is comparable or higher (e.g., for H$^{13}$CO$^+$) than in the local Galaxy, whereas SO forms less efficiently. These results have significant implications for chemical models of the outermost star-forming regions and for understanding molecule formation under lower metallicity conditions.",

Submitted to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Charting the Epoch of Reionization demands robust assessments of what drives the production of ionizing photons in high-redshift star-forming galaxies (SFGs), and requires better predictive capabilities from current observations. Using a sample of $N=159$ SFGs at $1<z<8$, observed with deep medium-resolution spectroscopy from the JWST/NIRSpec EXCELS survey, we perform a statistical analysis of their ionizing photon production efficiencies ($\\xi_\\rm{ion}$). We consider $\\xi_\\rm{ion}$, measured with Balmer line measurements, in relation to a number of key galaxy properties including; nebular emission line strengths ($W_\\lambda(\\rm{H\\alpha})$ and $W_\\lambda$( [OIII])), UV luminosity ($M_\\rm{UV}$) and UV slope ($\\beta_\\rm{UV}$), as well as dust attenuation ($E(B-V)_\\rm{neb}$) and redshift. Implementing a Bayesian linear regression methodology, we fit $\\xi_\\rm{ion}$ against the principal observables while fully marginalising over all measurement uncertainties, mitigating against the impact of outliers and determining the intrinsic scatter. Significant relations between $\\xi_\\rm{ion}$ and $ W_\\lambda(\\rm{H\\alpha})$, $W_\\lambda$([OIII]) and $\\beta_\\rm{UV}$ are recovered. Moreover, the weak trends with $M_\\rm{UV}$ and redshift can be fully explained by the remaining property dependencies. Expanding our analysis to multivariate regression, we determine that $W_\\lambda(\\rm{H\\alpha})$ or $W_\\lambda$([OIII]), along with $\\beta_\\rm{UV}$ and $E(B-V)_\\rm{neb}$, are the most important observables for accurately predicting $\\xi_\\rm{ion,0}$. The latter identifies the most common outliers as SFGs with relatively high $E(B-V)_\\rm{neb}\\gtrsim0.5$, possibly indicative of obscured star-formation or strong differential attenuation. Combining these properties enable $\\xi_\\rm{ion,0}$ to be inferred with an accuracy of $\\sim0.15\\,$dex, with a population intrinsic scatter of $\\sigma_\\rm{int}\\sim0.035\\,$dex.",

Comments are very welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) High-redshift (z > 2) massive quiescent (MQ) galaxies provide an opportunity to probe the key physical processes driving the fuelling and quenching of star formation in the early Universe. Observational evidence suggests a possible evolutionary link between MQs and dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs; or submillimetre galaxies), another extreme high-redshift population. However, galaxy formation models have historically struggled to reproduce these populations - especially simultaneously - limiting our understanding of their formation and connection, particularly in light of recent JWST findings. In previous work, we presented a re-calibrated version of the L-Galaxies semi-analytic model that provides an improved match to observationally-inferred number densities of both DSFG and MQ populations. In this work, we use this new model to investigate the progenitors of MQs at z > 2 and the physical mechanisms that lead to their quenching. We find that most MQs at z > 2 were sub-millimetre-bright ($S_{870}$ > 1 mJy) at some point in their cosmic past. The stellar mass of MQs is strongly correlated with the maximum submillimetre flux density attained over their history, and this relation appears to be independent of redshift. However, only a minority of high-redshift DSFGs evolve into MQs by z = 2. The key distinction between typical DSFGs and MQ progenitors lies in their merger histories: MQ progenitors experience an early major merger that triggers a brief, intense starburst and rapid black hole growth, depleting their cold gas reservoirs. In our model, AGN feedback subsequently prevents further gas cooling, resulting in quenching. In contrast, the broader DSFG population remains sub-millimetre-bright, with star formation proceeding primarily via secular processes, becoming quenched later.",

We derive a [C/N]-Age relationship for red giants calibrated on APOGEE DR17 abundances and APOKASC-3 asteroseismic ages. We find that we can use [C/N] to reliably recover asteroseismic ages between 1 and 10 Gyr with average uncertainties of 1.64 Gyr. We find that [C/N] yields concordant ages, with modest offsets, for stars in different evolutionary states. We also find that the [C/N]-birth mass relationship is robust for luminous giants, and argue that this is an advantage over direct asteroseismology for these stars. We use our ages to infer Galactic birth abundance trends in [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] as a function of position in the Galactic disk. We filter out stars with kinematic or chemical properties consistent with migrators and found the number of migrators to be much lower than expected by standard radial migration prescriptions. The remaining population shows weak chemical evolution trends, on the order of 0.01 dex/Gyr, over the last 10 Gyr across a wide range of radii.",

Stephens, Zhi-Yun Li, Floris F.S. van der Tak, John J. Tobin 23 pages, 18 figures, 1 table, Accepted for publication in ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Magnetic fields influence the structure and evolution of protostellar systems, thus understanding their role is essential for probing the earliest stages of star formation. We present ALMA Band 3 and 6 polarized continuum observations at $\\sim$0.5$^{\\prime \\prime}$ resolution toward the Class 0 protostellar system HH 211. Three dust filaments ($\\sim$4000 au in length) are found in the HH 211 protostellar envelope, two of which are aligned with core-scale ($\\sim$10,000 au) magnetic fields detected by previous JCMT observations. This result suggests that the formation of the dust filaments may be influenced by magnetic fields. In the inner envelope ($\\sim$1000 au), we detect a clear hourglass-shaped magnetic field morphology near the protostar and toroidal fields along the outflow directions. We also estimate the line-of-sight-averaged temperature and column density distributions in the inner envelope and find that the temperature is higher in the east, while the column density is enhanced in the southern and western regions. The southern dense regions of the inner envelope may trace either outflow cavity walls, due to their alignment with the outflow, or possible infalling channels in the midplane, given the close correspondence between the observed magnetic fields and the predicted infall trajectories.",

Puzia, Rohan Rahatgaonkar Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Emission lines of FeI and NiI are commonly found in the coma of solar system comets, even at large heliocentric distances. These atoms are most likely released from the surface of the comet's nucleus or from a short-lived parent. The presence of these lines in cometary spectra is unexpected because the surface blackbody equilibrium temperature is too low to allow the sublimation of refractory minerals containing these metals. These lines were also found in the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov which has a NiI/FeI abundance ratio similar to that observed in solar system comets. On average, this ratio is one order of magnitude higher than the solar Ni/Fe abundance ratio. Here, we report observations of the new interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which were carried out with the ESO Very Large Telescope equipped with the UVES spectrograph. Spectra were obtained at six epochs, at heliocentric distances ranging from 3.14 to 2.14 au. NiI was detected at all epochs. FeI was only detected at heliocentric distances smaller than 2.64 au. We estimated the NiI and FeI production rates by comparing the observed line intensities with those produced by a fluorescence model. Comet 3I exhibits a high production rate of NiI atoms as well as a high NiI/FeI ratio, making it exceptional when compared to solar system comets and 2I/Borisov. Additionally, we found that the NiI/FeI ratio decreases rapidly with decreasing heliocentric distance, suggesting that comet 3I could soon become indistinguishable from solar system comets in this respect. We interpreted these observations assuming that the NiI and FeI atoms were released through the sublimation of Ni(CO)$_4$ and Fe(CO)$_5$ carbonyls, which supports the presence of these species in the cometary material.",

Johnson, Domenico Nardiello Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We study the white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence of the Galactic Globular Cluster (GGC) NGC 2808 by using deep near-UV data from the Hubble Space Telescope and theoretical models, to investigate if this cluster hosts an excess of WDs. Excess in WDs is a rare phenomenon that has been found to exist only in a few GGCs. We compared star counts from different evolutionary phases on the near-UV color-magnitude diagram to evolutionary times predicted by BaSTI models. The investigation was carried out over a region within a radii of 1.5 $\\arcmin$ of the cluster center and a region of similar dimension located 5$\\arcmin$ away. We find a WD excess of $\\approx$ 60 - 70\\% when comparing star counts and evolutionary models of the WD cooling sequence to the main-sequence turn-off, and by using different values and fractions of Helium enhancement. This excess decreases to $\\approx$ 30 - 40\\% when the WD cooling sequence is compared to the horizontal branch. The WD excess is slightly larger in the internal field that covers the cluster center; however, the difference with the external field is compatible within the uncertainties. We argue that this excess is possibly related to the existence of SCWDs and Helium-core WDs in NGC~2808, and might be directly associated to the extended blue horizontal branch of this GGC.",

Nazarenko 14 pages; 13 figures; new refs and comments added Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The phase diagrams of ultralight dark matter (DM), modeled as a self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensate with axionlike interaction, are studied. We classify stable, metastable, and unstable DM states over a wide range of condensate wave function amplitudes. It is shown that the axionlike interaction causes instability and an imaginary speed of sound at low amplitudes, whereas, in a specific high-amplitude band, DM attains a stable state capable of forming a dense solitonic core and suppressing quantum fluctuations in the surrounding galactic DM halo. These findings are corroborated by evaluating thermodynamic functions for DM in the dwarf galaxy NGC 2366 and its hypothetical analogs with different core-to-halo mass ratios. Distinct DM phase compositions respond differently to fluctuation-induced partial pressure, resulting in a first-order phase transition in a certain range of an interaction parameter. While the DM properties in NGC 2366 lie within the supercritical regime, the phase transition nonetheless provides a thermodynamic marker separating stable from unstable DM configurations. Once a dense core forms - reaching a threshold of about 12% of the total mass - the enhanced gravitation stabilizes the DM halo against fluctuations, while the internal pressure ensures core stability. In particular, we find that NGC 2366's dense DM comprises roughly 19% of the DM mass while occupying only 4.7% of its total volume.",

Yi 16 pages, 7 figures. Accepted for publication in ApJS, minor corrections after proof Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We build upon FEGA25 (Contini et al 2025), a previously introduced semi-analytic model for galaxy formation and evolution, focusing on its enhanced treatment of supernova and active galactic nucleus feedback mechanisms. In addition to the traditional AGN feedback modes, negative (suppressing cooling), and the new positive mode (triggering star formation), we introduce two implementations of a third mode: the ejection of hot gas beyond the virial radius, AGNeject1 and AGNeject2. This component addresses a longstanding issue in semi-analytic models and hydrodynamical simulations: the overestimation of hot gas fractions in low and intermediate mass halos. FEGA25 is calibrated via MCMC using a suite of cosmological N-body simulations YS50HR, YS200, and YS300, and a comprehensive set of observed stellar mass functions across a wide redshift range. We find that supernova feedback dominates gas ejection in halos with logM_{halo} < approximately 12, while AGN feedback becomes increasingly important at higher halo masses. The AGNeject2 model, which activates primarily at late times, redshift < 1, reproduces a characteristic cavity, a U shaped feature in the baryon fraction at redshift zero, similar to trends observed in simulations like SIMBA and IllustrisTNG. Conversely, AGNeject1 yields a smoother, redshift independent evolution. Both models preserve the stellar and cold gas components and successfully reproduce the stellar to halo mass relation up to redshift 3. Our results emphasize that a physically motivated AGN driven mechanism capable of selectively removing hot gas is essential to accurately model the baryon cycle, particularly in intermediate halo mass regimes.",

Belokurov, Yuki Isobe, Gareth Jones, Claudia Maraston, Jan Scholtz, Charlotte Simmonds, Sandro Tacchella, Elena Terlevich, Roberto Terlevich 32 pages, 21 figures, submitted to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Recent JWST observations have revealed a puzzling population of optically red and compact galaxies with peculiar \"V\"-shaped spectra at high redshift, known as \"Little Red Dots\" (LRDs). Until now, most spectroscopically confirmed LRDs are found at z > 4 and it has been speculated that LRDs are tracing the early stages of black hole evolution. We report an independent rediscovery of a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), SDSS J102530.29+140207.3, at z = 0.1, which shows spectral features matching those of LRDs seen in the early Universe, including the V-shaped spectrum, broad Balmer lines (with widths of 1000-2000 km/s), and deep Balmer absorption. We present a new GTC observation of this LRD, which reveals an optical continuum similar to those of G-to-K giant stars including an unambiguous G-band absorption originating from the CH molecule. In addition, this local LRD shows a series of absorption lines potentially related to low-ionization ions or atoms but are deeper than what is observed in empirical stellar templates. We further identify a series of [FeII] emission lines indicative of low-ionization gas, which we find also present in an JWST-selected LRD at z = 2.26. We find small but statistically significant variability in H$\\alpha$ consistent with previous findings. Finally, with the new X-ray observation from NuSTAR, we confirm the extreme X-ray weakness of this LRD, which might imply Compton-thick gas obscuration with $N_{\\rm H}>10^{24}~{\\rm cm^{-2}}$. All evidence suggests SDSS J102530.29+140207.3 has a complex gaseous environment and the strong ionic, atomic, and molecular absorptions are hard to explain with typical stellar and AGN models.",

Kulkarni, Suraj Poudel, Nicolas Tejos, Celine Peroux, Sebastian Lopez Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) A powerful technique to trace the signatures of the first stars is through the metal enrichment in concentrated reservoirs of hydrogen, such as the damped Lyman-alpha absorbers (DLAs) in the early universe. We conducted a survey aimed at discovering DLAs along sight lines to high-z quasars in order to measure element abundances at z>4. Here we report our first results from this survey for 10 DLAs with redshifts of ~4.2-5.0. We determine abundances of C, O, Si, S, and Fe, and thereby the metallicities and dust depletions. We find that DLA metallicities at z>4.5 show a wide diversity spanning ~3 orders of magnitude. The metallicities of DLAs at 3.7<z<5.3 show a larger dispersion compared to that at lower redshifts. Combining our sample with the literature, we find a relatively smooth evolution of metallicity with redshift out to z~5.3, with a tentative (~2 sigma) indication of a slight rise in metallicity at 4.5<z<5.3. The relative abundances exhibit C enhancement for both metal-poor and metal-enriched DLAs. In addition, alpha-element enhancement is evident in some DLAs, including a DLA at z=4.7 with a super-solar metallicity. Comparing [C/O] and [Si/O] with model predictions, 4 DLAs in our survey seem consistent with a non-zero Pop III contribution (3 with >=30% Pop-III contribution). Combining our sample and the literature, we find the dust depletion strength and dust-to-metal ratios to correlate positively with the total (gas+solid phase) metallicity, confirming the presence of metal-rich, dusty DLAs even at ~1 billion years after the Big Bang.",

Sanders, Danielle A. Berg, Peter Senchyna, Fabio Bresolin, Daniel P. Stark Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The carbon to oxygen (C/O) abundance ratio is a valuable tracer of star formation history, as C and O enrichment occurs on different timescales. However, measurements based on ultraviolet (UV) collisionally excited lines and those based on optical recombination lines may be subject to biases from the abundance discrepancy factor (ADF), which is well established for oxygen but uncertain for carbon. We present precise UV-based measurements of gas-phase C$^{2+}$/O$^{2+}$ ionic abundance in four H II regions which have prior optical-based measurements, combined with archival UV data for two additional H II regions, in order to establish a reliable abundance scale and to investigate biases between the two methods. We find a clear ADF for the C$^{2+}$ ion which is consistent with that of O$^{2+}$, assuming a similar temperature structure in the zones of the nebula which these ions occupy. The C/O abundance derived from UV collisional lines and optical recombination lines is therefore also consistent to within $<0.1$ dex, with an offset of $0.05\\pm0.03$ dex in C$^{2+}$/O$^{2+}$ for the standard T$_e$ method. While the absolute C/H and O/H abundances are subject to large uncertainty from the ADF, our results establish that C/O abundances measured from these different methods can be reliably compared. Thus we confirm the robustness of gas-phase C/O measurements for studying galaxy evolution and star formation timescales, including from rest-UV observations of high redshift galaxies with JWST.",

      "abstract": "How far have metals reached? Reconciling statistical constraints and enrichment models at reionization Sebastian Lopez, Jens-Kristian Krogager Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The incidence of quasar absorption systems and the space density of their galaxies are proportional, the proportionality factor being the mean absorbing cross section. In this paper we use redshift parameterizations of these two statistics to predict the cosmic evolution of an equivalent-width ($W_r$) radial profile model, tailored for the low-ionization species Mg II and O I. Our model provides an excellent match with well-sampled, low-redshift Mg II equivalent-width/impact-parameter pairs from the literature. We then focus on the evolution of various quantities between the Reionization and Cosmic Noon eras. Our findings are: (1) The extent of Mg II and hence the amount of cool ($T\\sim 10^4$ K), enriched gas in the average halo decreases continuously with cosmic time after $z \\approx 6$--$8$. This effect is more pronounced in $W_r^{2796}\\lesssim 0.3$ Å systems (outermost layers of the model) and, in general, affects O I more than Mg II, probably due to the onset of photoionization by the UV background. (2) The line density of $W_r^{2796}\\gtrsim 1$ Å systems (model inner layers) constantly increases in synchrony with the star formation rate density until it reaches a peak at Cosmic Noon. The line density of $W_r^{2796}\\lesssim 0.3$ Å systems, on the other hand, remains constant or decreases over the same period. (3) At the end of Reionization, the filling factor is low enough that the winds have not yet reached neighboring halos. This implies that the halos are self-enriched, as suggested by semi-analytic models. We discuss how these statistical predictions can be reconciled with early metal enrichment models and offer a practical comparison point for future analyses of quasar absorption lines at $z>6$.",

Given that the chemical inventory on interstellar dust grains in the prestellar phases might be altered due to the prostostellar warm-up, an alternative to infer the chemical composition on the grains could be to observe regions affected by shocks associated with molecular outflows. Such shocks can desorb the molecules, and might produce less chemical processing due to shorter timescales. We present here a detailed study of the chemical reservoir of a shocked region located in the G31.41+0.31 protocluster using GUAPOS data (G31.41+0.31 Unbiased ALMA sPectral Observational Survey). We report here the detection of 30 molecular species (plus 18 isotopologues). We performed a comparison of the molecular ratios in the shocked region with those derived towards the hot core of G31.41+0.31, finding that they are poorly correlated, excepting N-bearing species. Our results confirm observationally that a different level of chemical alteration is present in hot cores and in shocks. While the former likely alter the molecular ratios due to thermal processing during longer timescales, the latter might represent freshly desorbed material that constitutes a better proxy of the icy mantle composition. The similarity of molecular ratios between the N-bearing species in the G31.41 shock and the hot core suggests that these species are desorbed at early evolutionary stages. Interestingly, we have found that the abundances in the G31.41 shock show better correlations with other shock-dominated regions (two protostellar outflows and a Galactic Center molecular cloud). This suggests a negligible gas-phase chemistry after shock-induced ejection from grains, and that the ice-mantle composition is similar regardless of the Galactic environment.",

Paek 25 pages, 11 figures, Accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate the expected accuracy of redshifts that can be obtained using low-resolution spectroscopic (medium-band) data from the 7-Dimensional Sky Survey (7DS). By leveraging 40 densely sampled filters with widths of full width at half maximum (FWHM) = 25 nm, we create 7DS mock catalogs and estimate the redshift accuracy for three 7DS main surveys: Wide-field Time-Domain Survey (WTS), Intensive Monitoring Survey (IMS), and Reference Image Survey (RIS). Using photometric redshifts calculated from EAZY, we find that the five-year WTS provides reliable photometric redshifts with an normalized median absolute deviation (${\\sigma}_{\\text{NMAD}}$) ranging from 0.003 to 0.007 and a catastrophic failure fraction ({\\eta}) from 0.8% to 8.1% at $19 \\leq m_{625} < 22$. The spectral resolution R ~ 50 of the medium-band dataset effectively captures the 4000 Å break and various emission lines. We also explore the synergy with data obtained from Pan-STARRS1, VIKING, and SPHEREx surveys. Combining the SPHEREx all-sky data with WTS significantly improves the accuracy of photometric redshift estimates, achieving {\\eta} = 0.4% and ${\\sigma}_{\\text{NMAD}}$ = 0.004 for fainter sources at higher redshifts. The additional near-IR information provided by SPHEREx and VIKING plays an essential role in resolving degeneracies between low and high redshifts. We also observe color excesses by subtracting adjacent broad-band data, which improves the confinement of photometric redshifts and aids in the detection of strong emission line galaxies.",

Searching for HVSs and studying their origins can be an important way to study the properties of the Milky Way. In this paper, we utilize precise distances for RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) derived from the period-absolute magnitude-metallicity (PMZ) relation, along with proper motions from Gaia DR3, to conduct a large-volume search for HVSs. Our sample consists of a catalog with 8,172 RRLs with metallicity, distance and radial velocities estimated from SDSS and LAMOST spectroscopic data, and an extended catalog of 135,873 RRLs with metallicity and distance estimated from Gaia photometry. After careful quality cuts, 165 hypervelocity RRL candidates were found. We performed further checks on their light curves, and selected the most reliable 87 hypervelocity RRLs. All of them exceed the Milky Way's escape velocity in the tangential component. Among them, 7 stars have tangential velocity over 800 km s^-1. We identified two spatially distinct distributions of hypervelocity RRLs: one concentrated toward the Galactic Center and another localized around the Magellanic Clouds, suggesting that their origins are likely associated with these regions through the Hills or other mechanisms. Furthermore, we detected a significant number of RRLs associated with dwarf galaxies that exceed the Milky Way's escape velocity, likely ejected from their host systems. Future Gaia releases and spectroscopic follow-up observations will provide further insight into their ejection origin.",

We present high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 3 and 4 continuum observations of EX Lupi, the prototypical EXor-type variable, reconstructed using super-resolution imaging with sparse modeling. Our images reveal, for the first time, two distinct substructures: a compact, crescent-shaped inner arc within 10 au of the star, and a narrow outer ring at 30 au. The inner arc is strongly elongated and casts a shadow observed in the Very Large Telescope/SPHERE near-infrared scattered light. The outer ring exhibits a radial width comparable to the local pressure scale height, consistent with moderately efficient dust trapping. Geometric and thermal analysis of the disk surface, based on combined ALMA and SPHERE data, indicates that the disk is moderately flared with an average disk temperature consistent with that of classical T Tauri disks. The observed substructures suggest dynamical perturbations-plausibly induced by a massive companion companion-that may modulate accretion rates through gravitational interaction with the inner arc. These findings provide morphological evidence linking disk substructure to episodic accretion in the structurally mature disk.",

The QUOKKA code described in this article is fully open-source and can be accessed at: this https URL Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a novel, GPU-optimized algorithm for particle-mesh interactions in grid-based hydrodynamics simulations, designed for massively parallel architectures. This approach overcomes the inefficiency of particle neighbour searches or sorts across multiple GPU nodes by using a new ``particle-mesh-particle'' interaction scheme, which extends the particle-mesh method for self-gravity. The algorithm proceeds in two main stages: first, quantities exchanged between particles and the mesh -- such as mass, energy, and momentum added by stellar feedback or removed by accretion onto a sink -- are deposited into a buffer mesh equipped with ghost zones, where multiple contributions per cell are accumulated using atomic additions and then communicated across distributed memory ranks. In the second stage, the buffer states are applied to real mesh states, incorporating cell-wise limiters to enforce physical constraints such as positive density. We implement this scheme in the GPU-native radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code QUOKKA, demonstrating its application to both supernova feedback and sink particle accretion. We demonstrate that the former scheme converges in the terminal radial momentum from multiple supernovae across varying spatial resolutions, while for the latter simulations of accretion in several configurations show excellent agreement with analytic solutions. This scheme enables efficient, scalable particle-mesh coupling for GPU-optimized simulations.",

We present HELIOPANDA: Heliospheric Observer for Predicting CME Arrival via Nonlinear Drag Assimilation, a framework that integrates the Drag-Based Model (DBM) with spacecraft observations using iterative parameter estimation and Kalman filter assimilation. We introduce a method for estimating the solar wind speed $w$ and drag parameter $\\gamma$, two key but usually unknown quantities controlling CME propagation, through direct solutions of the DBM equations. We tested the method on 4,480 synthetic CME profiles spanning CME speeds of $200-3500$ km/s, solar wind speeds of $250-800$ km/s, and drag parameters of $0.1-1.0\\times10^{-7}$ km$^{-1}$. The results demonstrate that the framework provides accurate reconstructions of the DBM input parameters, providing a solid basis for in-situ and remote-sensing applications. By testing a single virtual spacecraft positioned at nine distances along the Sun-Earth line, HELIOPANDA achieved arrival-time errors as low as 0.6 hours for a 600 km/s CME and 1 hour for a 2500 km/s CME when the spacecraft was located 30 million km from the Sun. We developed a Kalman filter framework to assimilate noisy heliospheric data into the DBM, enabling recursive updates of CME kinematics and robust estimates of $w$ and $\\gamma$, and yielding Earth and Mars arrival-time predictions within $1-2$ hours using 160 simulated hourly measurements. By combining DBM, parameter recovery, and data assimilation, HELIOPANDA provides a pathway to real-time, multi-point CME forecasts, suited to observations from Solar Orbiter, Parker Solar Probe, PUNCH, and planned L4/L5 missions.",

Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Context: Solar flares accelerate electrons, creating non-thermal energy distributions. However, the acceleration sites and dominant acceleration mechanisms remain largely unknown. Aims: We study the characteristics of electron acceleration and subsequent non-thermal energy distribution in a 2D coronal plasmoid-mediated reconnecting current sheet. Methods: We used test particles and the guiding centre approximation to transport electrons in a static coronal 2D fan-spine topology magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) snapshot. The snapshot was from a Bifrost simulation that featured plasmoid-mediated reconnection at a current sheet. To sample initial particle conditions that lead to non-thermal energies, we used importance sampling. In this way, the characteristics of the non-thermal electrons were statistically representative of the MHD plasma. Results: The energy distribution of the electrons forms a non-thermal power law that varies with our tolerance of the guiding centre approximation's validity, from no obvious power law to a power law with an exponent of -4 (the power law also depends on the statistical weighing of the electrons). The non-thermal electrons gain energy through a gradual betatron acceleration close to magnetic null points associated with plasmoids. Conclusions: In this static, asymmetric, coronal, 2D fan-spine topology MHD configuration, non-thermal electron acceleration occurs only in the vicinity of null points associated with magnetic gradients and electric fields induced by plasmoid formation and ejection. However, the guiding centre approximation alone is not sufficient to properly estimate the shape of the non-thermal power law since, according to our results, electron acceleration is correlated with the adiabaticity of the particles' motion. The results also show that the particle power law formation is biased by the test particle sampling procedure.",

Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Elemental abundances in solar flares are observed to vary both spatially and temporally, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. There is an interplay between advection and the preferential acceleration of low first ionization potential (FIP) elements that likely shapes the observed abundance distributions. Models of the FIP effect predict enhancements near loop footpoints that diffuse upward over time. We simulate strong evaporation events that advect this low-FIP enhancement into the corona. When the enhancement is sharply peaked, the corona does not become fractionated, exhibiting only a localized abundance peak near the loop apex that facilitates coronal rain formation. In contrast, a broad enhancement with relatively weak heating yields a uniformly fractionated corona, which is not sufficient for coronal rain formation. As the heating rate increases, the low-FIP material is increasingly compressed toward the loop apex, and rain is able to form. These results suggest a potential observational correlation between the presence and amount of coronal rain, the strength of flare heating, and the fractionation process itself.",

Kubát Accepted for publication in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Understanding interactions of binary systems on the red giant branch is crucial to understanding the formation of compact stellar remnants such as helium-core white dwarfs (He-WDs) and hot subdwarfs. However, the detailed evolution of such systems, particularly those with nearly identical components, remains under-explored. We aim to analyse the double-lined spectroscopic binary system BD+20 5391, composed of two red giant stars, in order to characterise its orbital and stellar parameters and to constrain its evolution. Spectroscopic data were collected between 2020 and 2025 using the Ondřejov Echelle Spectrograph and the Mercator Échelle Spectrograph. The time-resolved spectra were fitted with models to determine the radial velocity curve and derive the system's parameters. We then used the position of both stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram to constrain the system's current evolutionary state, and we discuss potential outcomes of future interactions between the binary components. We find that the two stars in BD+20 5391 will likely initiate Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) simultaneously, leading to a double-core evolution scenario. The stars' helium core masses at RLOF onset will be almost identical, at 0.33 $\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$. This synchronised evolution suggests two possible outcomes: common envelope ejection, resulting in a short-period double He-WD binary, or a merger without envelope ejection. In the former case, the resulting double He-WD may merge later and form a hot subdwarf star. This study provides a valuable benchmark example for understanding the evolution of interacting red giant binaries, which will be discovered in substantial numbers in upcoming large-scale spectroscopic surveys.",

Operating from the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrange point, SoLEXS has been providing continuous Sun-as-a-star soft X-ray spectroscopy across 2-22 keV with 170 eV resolution at 5.9 keV and 1-second temporal cadence since 6 January 2024. The instrument employs two Silicon Drift Detectors with aperture areas of 7.1 mm$^2$ and 0.1 mm$^2$ to accommodate the full dynamic range of solar activity from A-class to X-class flares. This paper presents comprehensive ground and on board calibration procedures that establish SoLEXS's quantitative spectroscopic capabilities. Ground calibration encompassed energy-channel relationships, spectral resolution characterization, instrument response functions, and collimator angular response measurements, with thermo-vacuum testing validating performance stability across operational temperature ranges. On board calibration utilizing an internal $^{55}$Fe source demonstrated preserved post-launch spectral resolution (164.9-171.2 eV), while cross-calibration with GOES-XRS and Chandrayaan-2/XSM confirmed radiometric accuracy and flux agreement. The instrument's 100% observational duty cycle at L1 enables unprecedented continuous monitoring of solar flare evolution across all intensity classes, providing calibrated data for advancing coronal heating mechanisms, flare energetics, and flare-coronal mass ejection relationship studies through soft X-ray spectroscopy.",

Basu Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics, 11 pages, 4 figures Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Accurate estimates of internal red-giant rotation rates are a crucial ingredient for constraining and improving current models of stellar rotation. Asteroseismic rotational inversions are a method to estimate these internal rotation rates. In this work, we focus on the observed differences in the rotationally-induced frequency shifts between prograde and retrograde modes, which were ignored in previous works when estimating internal rotation rates of red giants using inversions. We systematically study the limits of applicability of linear rotational inversions as a function of the evolution on the red-giant branch and the underlying rotation rates. We solve for the oscillation mode frequencies in the presence of rotation in the lowest-order perturbative approach. This enables a description of the differences between prograde and retrograde modes through the coupling of multiple mixed modes. We compute synthetic rotational splittings taking these near-degeneracy effects into account. We use red-giant models with one solar mass, a large frequency separation between 16 and 9 microhertz and core rotation rates between 500 and 1500 nHz covering the regime of observed parameters of Kepler red-giant stars. Finally, we use these synthetic data to quantify the systematic errors of internal rotation rates estimated by means of rotational inversions in the presence of near-degeneracy effects. We show that the systematic errors in the estimated rotation rates introduced by near-degeneracy effects surpass observational uncertainties for more evolved and faster rotating stars. The estimated rotation rates of some of the previously analysed red giants suffer from significant systematic errors that have not been taken into account yet. Notwithstanding, reliable analyses with existing inversion methods are feasible for a number of red giants within the parameter ranges determined here.",

Atmospheric modeling suggests the presence of a $\\approx$300 K thermal inversion in its upper atmosphere, potentially driven by auroral activity. We present an extension of the retrieved spectra of W1935 with and without inversion spanning 1--20 microns, to identify thermal inversion-sensitive spectral features and explore the origin of the object's peculiar characteristics. Our analysis indicates that atmospheric heating contributes approximately 15% to the bolometric luminosity. The model with inversion predicts an additional similar-strength methane emission feature at 7.7 microns and tentative ammonia emission features in the mid-infrared. Wavelengths beyond $\\sim$2 microns are significantly influenced by the inversion, except for the 4.1--5.0 microns CO$_2$ and CO features that originate from atmospheric layers deeper than the region where the inversion occurs. W1935 appears as an outlier in Spitzer/IRAC mid-infrared color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) based on the $m_{\\rm Ch1}-m_{\\rm Ch2}$ (IRAC 3.6 microns $-$ 4.5 microns) color, but exhibits average behavior in all other combinations that trace clear sequences. This anomaly is likely due to the Ch2 filter probing vertical mixing-sensitive CO$_2$ and CO features that do not correlate with temperature or spectral type. We find that the thermal inversion tends to produce bluer $m_{\\rm Ch1}-m_{\\rm Ch2}$ colors, so the overluminous and/or redder position of W1935 in diagrams involving this color cannot be explained by the thermal inversion. This analysis provides insights into the intriguing dispersion of cold brown dwarfs in mid-infrared CMDs and sheds light on their spectral diversity.",

Properties of this fundamental process are poorly described near the solar poles. Here we report the first out-of-ecliptic remote-sensing observations of the south pole of the Sun from a high-latitude campaign of the Solar Orbiter spacecraft which reveal spatial and temporal evolution of supergranular convective cells. The supergranular cells have spatial scales of 20--40\\,Mm. From eight days of observations starting on 2025 March 16, our analysis shows that the magnetic network migrates poleward, on average, at high latitudes (above 60\\textdegree), with speeds in the range of 10--20\\,m\\,s$^{-1}$, depending on the structures being tracked. These results shed light on the buildup of the polar magnetic field that is central to our understanding of the solar cycle and the heliospheric magnetic field.",

Kent Wallace, Ji Wang, Yinzi Xin, Judah Van Zandt Resubmitted to AAS journals after revision Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Stellar multiplicity plays a crucial role in shaping planet formation and dynamical evolution. We present a survey of 54 TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) within 300 pc that exhibit significant Hipparcos-Gaia astrometric accelerations. We identified 35 TOIs with stellar companions at projected separations between $0.1^{\\prime\\prime}$ to $2^{\\prime\\prime}$ (or $10-200$ AU). We also identified 12 TOIs that could host planetary-mass or brown dwarf companions, including 6 that are newly discovered. Furthermore, we perform three-dimensional orbital characterization for 12 binaries hosting confirmed planets or planet candidates, allowing us to constrain the line-of-sight mutual inclination, $\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{los}}$, between the planetary and binary orbits. Combining our sample with previous measurements, we apply Bayesian hierarchical analysis to a total of 26 binary systems with S-type transiting planets ($r_p<5R_{\\oplus}$). Specifically, we fit the $\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{los}}$ distribution with both single (Rayleigh) and mixture models (two-component Rayleigh and Rayleigh-isotropic mixture). We find the mixture models are strongly favored ($\\log Z\\gtrsim13.9$, or $\\approx$5$\\sigma$), indicating the observed planet-binary $\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{los}}$ values likely originate from two underlying populations: one nearly aligned ($\\sigma_1 = 2^{\\circ}.4^{+0.7}_{-0.9}$) and one with more scattered mutual inclinations ($\\sigma_2 = 23^{\\circ}.6^{+8.8}_{-7.1}$). Alternatively, the misaligned systems can be equally well described by an isotropic distribution of inclinations. This observed dichotomy likely reflects different dynamical histories. Notably, the misaligned population only emerges in systems with stellar periastron distances $>40$ AU while systems with close-in or eccentric stellar companions (periastron distances $<40$ AU) preserve planet-binary alignment.",

Code available open-source at this https URL Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The surfaces of rotating stars serve as a window into their interiors, magnetic dynamos, and are important in other areas including exoplanet discovery and atmospheric characterization. While indirect techniques such as photometry and Doppler imaging have been studied for their ability to map stellar surfaces, the gold standard remains optical long-baseline interferometry. In this paper, we develop new closed-form solutions for the interferometric visibility of a rotating star with an arbitrary inhomogeneous surface. We introduce the concept of 'stellar rotation synthesis' in interferometry--an analog of Earth rotation synthesis--where stellar rotation adds information to the spherical harmonic modes representing the star's surface intensity. We implement these solutions in the open-source package harmonix, written in JAX with automatic differentiation, providing a rich ecosystem for fitting and inference. Inspired by similar studies for photometry and Doppler imaging, we use simulations of a fiducial star as observed by the CHARA Array and intensity interferometers to perform a comprehensive theoretical study of the information theory of the starspot mapping problem in interferometry. We show that adding simultaneous photometry from a space-based instrument such as TESS adds complementary spatial information to interferometry and can improve the precision on the map coefficients by over an order of magnitude, enabling the detailed mapping of nearby main-sequence stars with current facilities. Finally, we evaluate the performance of existing and proposed intensity interferometers for stellar surface mapping.",

Exoplanet atmosphere studies often assume solar abundances for host stars, however, specific host star abundances might lead to more accurate constraints. In this work, we perform sensitivity studies for a metal rich stellar host HD 149026 and its exoplanet HD 149026b, to understand the effect of solar versus stellar abundance choice on the $P$-$T$ profiles, equilibrium chemical abundances and emission spectra, using self-consistent atmosphere models. We find that the differences are dependent on the model parameters, particularly C/O ratio, and for HD 149026b the difference in the eclipse depth is maximum $\\sim$80 ppm, for C/O between 0.75-0.85. Recent JWST NIRCam observations of HD 149026b have yielded widely varying metallicity ranges, highly super-solar (59-275$\\times$) using chemical equilibrium retrievals and 12-31$\\times$ solar using self-consistent models, both using solar abundances. In this work, we constrain the metallicity of HD 149026b to be 53-113$\\times$ solar, with solar abundances and 39-78$\\times$ stellar, with stellar abundances. We constrain the self-consistent $P$-$T$ profile of HD 149026b to be substantially cooler (upto 500 K) than the self-consistent best-fit model in the previous work, in the emission spectra probed region, thus requiring higher CO$_2$ abundance to explain the observations, leading to comparatively higher metallicity constraint. We find that the inclusion of Fe opacity in computing self-consistent $P$-$T$ profiles for HD 149026b in our models is the major reason for these differences. We constrain the C/O ratio to 0.47-0.68 and the heat redistribution factor to 0.70-0.76, indicating higher heat redistribution than previously estimated.",

Wolf Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Context: Investigating the vertical distribution of molecular content in protoplanetary disks remains difficult in most disks mildly inclined along the line of sight. In contrast, edge-on disks provide a direct (tomographic) view of the 2D molecular brightness. Aims: We study the radial and vertical molecular distribution as well as the gas temperature and density by observing the Keplerian edge-on disk surrounding the Flying Saucer, a Class II object located in Ophiuchus. Methods: We use new and archival ALMA data to perform a tomography of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, CN, HCN, CS, H$_2$CO, c-C$_3$H$_2$, N$_2$D$^+$, DCN and $^{13}$CS. We analyze molecular tomographies and model data using the radiative transfer code DiskFit. Results: We directly measure the altitude above the mid-plane for each observed species. For the first time, we unambiguously demonstrate the presence of a common molecular layer and measure its thickness: most molecules are located at the same altitude versus radius. Beyond CO, as predicted by chemical models, the CN emission traces the upper boundary of the molecular layer, whereas the deuterated species (DCN and N2D+) resides below one scale-height. Our best fits from DiskFit show that most observed transitions in the molecular layer are thermalized because their excitation temperature is the same, around 17-20 K. Conclusions: These long-integration observations clearly reveal a molecular layer predominantly located around 1-2 scale height, at a temperature above the CO freeze-out temperature. The deuterated molecules are closer to the mid-plane and N2D+ may be a good proxy for the CO snowline. Some molecules, such as CN and H2CO, are likely influenced by the disk environment, at least beyond the mm dust disk radius. The direct observation of the molecular stratification opens the door to detailed chemical modeling in this disk which appears representative of T Tauri disks.",

Charbonneau resubmitted without line numbers Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Exoplanetary systems with multiple giant planets present an opportunity to understand planet formation, migration processes, and long-term system-wide dynamical interactions. In particular, they provide constraints to distinguish between smooth disk-driven migration or more dynamically excited system evolution pathways. We report the discovery and characterization of a unique multi-planet system hosting three gas giant planets orbiting the post-main sequence star TOI-375. The innermost planet, TOI-375 b, was initially detected by the TESS mission and then confirmed with photometric follow-up observations conducted using MEarth and LCOGT, and radial velocity measurements obtained with FEROS and CHIRON. The radial velocity data revealed the presence of two additional planetary candidates, TOI-375 c and TOI-375 d. We find that TOI-375 b is a hot Jupiter with an orbital period of $9.45469 \\pm 0.00002$ days, mass $0.745 \\pm 0.053,M_\\mathrm{J}$, radius $0.961 \\pm 0.043, R_\\mathrm{J}$, and eccentricity $0.087 \\pm 0.042$. The outer two planets, TOI-375 c and TOI-375 d, are warm-cold and cold Jupiters with orbital periods of $115.5^{+2.0}_{-1.6}$ days and $297.9^{+28.9}_{-18.6}$ days, and minimum masses of $2.11 \\pm 0.22, M_\\mathrm{J}$ and $1.40 \\pm 0.28, M_\\mathrm{J}$, respectively. In terms of formation and overall system architecture, the physical properties of TOI-375 b are consistent with the core accretion scenario, while the current configuration of the system could be explained by both disk-driven and high-eccentricity migration scenarios. The discovery of TOI-375 as the first known system hosting three or more fully evolved gas giants, with at least one transiting planet, makes it an excellent candidate for testing formation and migration theories.",

Skarka submitted to A&A, comments welcome Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The majority of massive stars are part of binary systems that may interact during their evolution. This has important consequences for systems in which one star develops into a Red supergiant (RSG); however, not many RSGs are known binaries. We aim to better constrain the properties of some of the known RSGs in binaries. We first focus on the VV Cephei type RSG KQ Pup (RSG+B-type companion, orbital period of 26 yr), where we have enough data to constrain the system's properties. We use archival photometry and UV spectroscopy, along with newly taken optical spectra and interferometric data. For KQ Pup, as well as for all other Galactic RSGs, we also analyzed the available TESS data. Using TESS photometry, we discovered eclipses with a period of $17.2596 \\: \\rm d$, associated with the hot B companion, making it a Ba+Bb pair. Meanwhile, the detection of the hydrogen Br$\\gamma$ line with VLTI-GRAVITY enabled us to track the orbital motion of the KQ Pup Ba+Bb pair and thus to determine the astrometric orbit. The dynamical masses agree with independent estimates from asteroseismology and evolutionary models. The results give a mass of $ \\sim 9 \\: \\rm M_{\\odot} $ for the RSG and $ \\sim 14 \\: \\rm M_{\\odot} $ for the sum of the hot components Ba+Bb. The observed properties of the system are compatible with a coeval hierarchical triple-star, where we constrain the minimum mass of KQ Pup Bb as $ \\gtrsim 1.2 \\: \\rm M_{\\odot} $. The variability of Balmer lines and the detection of Br$\\gamma$ represent a strong signature of Wind Roche Lobe Overflow, with enhanced signatures of disk-accretion to the Ba+Bb pair during the periastron. Meanwhile, TESS light curves show that about $\\sim 10 \\%$ of known Galactic binary RSGs may be eclipsing hierarchical triple systems, which suggests that a large fraction of other binary RSGs could also be triples.",

An Architecture-Dependent Mass-Radius Relation Dolev Bashi 7 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS Letters Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Exoplanet demographics increasingly reveal that planetary properties depend not only on local irradiation and composition but also on the wider system architecture. We analyse a sample of Neptune-sized short-period planets with well-measured masses and radii, identifying those whose host stars harbour at least one confirmed outer-giant (OG) companion. On the mass-radius (M-R) plane, the two populations diverge modestly: inner planets in OG systems cluster at systematically larger radii than their counterparts in no-giant (NG) systems, a result that remains suggestive after controlling for planet and stellar properties. Bayesian modelling quantifies the offset, revealing an average radius enhancement of $17 \\pm 4 \\%$ for inner planets in OG systems relative to NG systems at fixed mass. Alternative cuts, including the use of a homogeneous set of parameters, confirm the robustness of the signal, though the result still relies on small-number statistics. Possible mechanisms for the observed inflation include prolonged inner-disc gas supply that boosted envelope accretion, and volatile enrichment by the outer giant. If upheld, this empirical link between outer giants and inflated inner-planet radii offers a new constraint on coupled formation and evolution in planetary systems.",

We show that the exponential decay is temporary and owes its existence to the flattening of the velocity correlator at large scales. This effect corresponds to the existence of a long-living virtual level in the corresponding Schrodinger type equation. We also find the critical Reynolds number and the increment of growth/decay above and under the threshold; we express them in terms of the quantitative characteristic properties of the velocity correlator, which makes it possible to compare the results with the data of different simulations.",

Debris disks are composed of dust and occasionally small amounts of gas, both released through dynamical interactions of small rocky bodies and dust particles, such as collisions and evaporation. The distribution of the dust can reveal the presence of forming planets and its composition can directly trace that of comets, asteroids and even planets. While we have been observing debris disks for 40 years now, most observations so far have been restricted to the cold outer regions of the system, and therefore information of the terrestrial zone is still missing. The improved spatial resolution, inner working angle and sensitivity that the Habitable Worlds Observatory will provide will enable a much closer look into the structure and composition of debris disks (particularly of its inner region) and enable the search for the forming rocky planets within the disk.",

Commerçon Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Exascale supercomputing unleashes the potential for simulations of astrophysical systems with unprecedented resolution. Taking full advantage of this computing power requires the development of new algorithms and numerical methods that are GPU friendly and scalable. In the context of multi-fluid dust-gas dynamics, we propose a highly accurate algorithm that is specifically designed for GPUs. We developed a multi-fluid gas-dust algorithm capable of computing friction terms on GPU architectures to machine precision, with the constraint for the drag-time step to remain a fraction of the global hydrodynamic time step for computational efficiency in practice. We present a scaling-and-squaring algorithm tailored to modern architectures for computing the exponential of the drag matrix, enabling high accuracy in friction calculations across relevant astrophysical regimes. The algorithm was validated through the Dustybox Dustywave and Dustyshock tests. The algorithm was implemented and tested in two multi-GPU codes with different architectures and GPU programming models: Dyablo, an adaptive mesh refinement code based on the Kokkos library, and Shamrock, a multi-method code based on Sycl. On current architectures, the friction computation remains acceptable for both codes (below the typical hydro time step) up to 16 species, enabling a further implementation of growth and fragmentation. This algorithm might be applied to other physical processes, such as radiative transfer or chemistry.",

In this article, we describe in detail the development and optimisation of the final optical holographic element installed on the spectrograph of the auxiliary telescope (AuxTel) at the Rubin-LSST observatory. After recalling the general principle of a hologram used as a dispersing and focusing element, we describe the technical resources - optical bench and sky measurements - and modeling tools that enabled us to determine the optimum production parameters for the AuxTel hologram after 4 prototyping phases. We also describe the on-sky verifications and measurements carried out with various telescopes. Thanks to these various techniques, we have succeeded in obtaining a diffraction efficiency in the first order close to the maximum theoretically possible with our thin-type hologram. This hologram has been in place on AuxTel's spectrograph since February 2021, and has since given full satisfaction, coupled with analysis software adapted to slitless spectroscopy.",

Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Low Temperature Detectors (LTD 2025) Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Fulfilling the science goals of the Simons Observatory, a state-of-the-art cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment, has required deploying tens of thousands of superconducting bolometers. Reading out data from the observatory's more than 67,000 transition-edge sensor (TES) detectors while maintaining cryogenic conditions requires an effective multiplexing scheme. The SLAC microresonator radio frequency (SMuRF) electronics have been developed to provide the warm electronics for a high-density microwave frequency multiplexing readout system, and this system has been shown to achieve multiplexing factors on the order of 1,000. SMuRF has recently been deployed to the Simons Observatory, which is located at 5,200 m on Cerro Toco in Chile's Atacama Desert. As the SMuRF system is exposed to the desert's diurnal temperature swings, resulting phase drift in RF transmission lines may introduce a systematic signal contamination. We present studies of phase drift in the room-temperature RF lines of the Simons Observatory's 6 m large-aperture telescope, which hosts the largest deployment to date of TES microwave frequency multiplexing to a single telescope. We show that these phase drifts occur on time scales which are significantly longer than sky scanning, and that their contribution to on-sky in-transition detector noise is within the readout noise budget.",

Trujillo 35 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The boundary of solar system object discovery lies in detecting its faintest members. However, their discovery in detection catalogs from imaging surveys is fundamentally limited by the practice of thresholding detections at signal-to-noise (SNR) $\\geq 5$ to maintain catalog purity. Faint moving objects can be recovered from survey images using the shift-and-stack algorithm, which coadds pixels from multi-epoch images along a candidate trajectory. Trajectories matching real objects accumulate signal coherently, enabling high-confidence detections of very faint moving objects. Applying shift-and-stack comes with high computational cost, which scales with target object velocity, typically limiting its use to searches for slow-moving objects in the outer solar system. This work introduces a modified shift-and-stack algorithm that trades sensitivity for speedup. Our algorithm stacks low SNR detection catalogs instead of pixels, the sparsity of which enables approximations that reduce the number of stacks required. Our algorithm achieves real-world speedups of $10$--$10^3 \\times$ over image-based shift-and-stack while retaining the ability to find faint objects. We validate its performance by recovering synthetic inner and outer solar system objects injected into images from the DECam Ecliptic Exploration Project (DEEP). Exploring the sensitivity--compute time trade-off of this algorithm, we find that our method achieves a speedup of $\\sim30\\times$ with $88\\%$ of the memory usage while sacrificing $0.25$ mag in depth compared to image-based shift-and-stack. These speedups enable the broad application of shift-and-stack to large-scale imaging surveys and searches for faint inner solar system objects.

Rackham, Seth Redfield Accepted for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Cross-correlations techniques offer an alternative method to search for molecular species in JWST observations of exoplanet atmospheres. In a previous article, we applied cross-correlation functions for the first time to JWST NIRSpec/G395H observations of exoplanet atmospheres, resulting in a detection of CO in the transmission spectrum of WASP-39b and a tentative detection of CO isotopologues. Here we present an improved version of our cross-correlation technique and an investigation into how efficient the technique is when searching for other molecules in JWST NIRSpec/G395H data. Our search results in the detection of more molecules via cross-correlations in the atmosphere of WASP-39b, including $\\rm H_{2}O$ and $\\rm CO_{2}$, and confirms the CO detection. This result proves that cross-correlations are a robust and computationally cheap alternative method to search for molecular species in transmission spectra observed with JWST. We also searched for other molecules ($\\rm CH_{4}$, $\\rm NH_{3}$, $\\rm SO_{2}$, $\\rm N_{2}O$, $\\rm H_{2}S$, $\\rm PH_{3}$, $\\rm O_{3}$ and $\\rm C_{2}H_{2}$) that were not detected, for which we provide the definition of their cross-correlation baselines for future searches of those molecules in other targets. We find that that the cross-correlation search of each molecule is more efficient over limited wavelength regions of the spectrum, where the signal for that molecule dominates over other molecules, than over broad wavelength ranges. In general we also find that Gaussian normalization is the most efficient normalization mode for the generation of the molecular templates.",

Comments welcome Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Today's most detailed characterization of exoplanet atmospheres is accessible via transit spectroscopy (TS). Detecting transiting exoplanets only yields their size, and it is thus standard to measure a planet's mass before moving towards their atmospheric characterization, or even the publication of their discovery. This framework, however, can act as a bottleneck for high-throughput exoplanetology. Here, we review existing applications of an alternative approach deriving exoplanet masses in small JWST atmospheric exploration programs and quantify the potential of its systematic application. We find that for $\\sim$20\\% of transiting exoplanets with existing mass constraints, a small JWST exploration program could yield the planetary mass with a similar--or better -- precision. Such results suggest that proceeding directly with atmospheric exploration programs for favorable exoplanets (i.e., with a transmission spectroscopy metric, TSM, $\\geq$100) could substantially reduce the time from detection to exoplanet atmospheric study and further support JWST's scientific output over its lifetime while saving up to 20\\% of resources on radial-velocity (RV) facilities. Furthermore, it can substantially increase the sample of characterized planets of three distinct subpopulations (Neptune-sized, young, and hot-star exoplanets), each providing specific insights into formation and evolution processes. As the field of exoplanets increasingly turns to directly imaged planets, mastering the determination of planetary masses from atmospheric spectra will become essential.",

Previous searches have been restricted to small areas and short time baselines. We present a general framework to quantify both sensitivity and computational requirements for digital tracking of nonlinear motion across the full sky over multi-year baselines. We start from matched-filter stacking and derive how signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) degrades with trial orbit mismatch, which leads to a metric tensor on orbital parameter space. The metric defines local Euclidean coordinates in which SNR loss is isotropic, and a covariant density that specifies the exact number of trial orbits needed for a chosen SNR tolerance. We validate the approach with Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, recovering known objects in blind searches that stack thousands of images over six years along billions of trial orbits. We quantify ZTF's sensitivity to populations beyond 5 au and show that stacking reaches most of the remaining Planet 9 parameter space. The computational demands of all-sky, multi-year tracking are extreme, but we demonstrate that time segmentation and image blurring greatly reduce orbit density at modest sensitivity cost. Stacking effectively boosts medium-aperture surveys to the Rubin Observatory single-exposure depth across the northern sky. Digital tracking in dense Rubin observations of a 10 sq. deg field is tractable and could detect trans-Neptunian objects to 27th magnitude in a single night, with deep drilling fields reaching fainter still.",

Vodopyanov Optics (physics.optics); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) utilizes a pair of broadband mutually coherent laser frequency combs to enable high-resolution, high-accuracy spectroscopic measurements with atomic-clock-level frequency referencing, and rapid, multiplexed acquisition without moving parts. It has traditionally been confined to specific domains: terahertz, infrared, visible, and ultraviolet, each requiring distinct comb sources and detection mechanisms tailored to the nature of the spectroscopic target. Yet, similar techniques may be implemented in the terahertz (THz) and mid-infrared (MIR) regions, such as optical rectification for comb generation and electro-optic sampling for detection, both using crystals with quadratic nonlinearity. However, in the Reststrahlen band near phonon resonances in these crystals, typically between 5 and 10 THz, both linear and nonlinear susceptibilities experience abnormally high dispersion, and light propagation is strongly suppressed. This confines DCS operation to spectral regions either below or above the Reststrahlen band and effectively separating the THz and MIR domains. Here we demonstrate high-resolution DCS performed simultaneously over two broad spectral bands, each spanning an octave or more. The measurements cover both the MIR (350-1150 cm$^{-1}$; 8.7-28.5 $\\mu$m; 10.5-34.5 THz) and the THz region (80-160 cm$^{-1}$; 62.5-125 $\\mu$m; 2.4-4.8 THz), effectively bridging these traditionally separate regions within a single acquisition. This enables direct cross-referencing of molecular absorption line strengths across widely separated spectral domains. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the simultaneous acquisition of ro-vibrational and pure rotational absorption spectra of ammonia (NH$_3$) with a spectral resolution of 7.3 MHz (0.00024 cm$^{-1}$), sufficient to fully resolve Doppler-broadened line shapes across the entire measured spectral range.",

Understanding exoplanet spectra requires atmospheric chemical and climate models that span the diversity of planetary atmospheres. Here, we present a more general chemical and climate model of planetary atmospheres. Specifically, we introduce the open-source, one-dimensional photochemical and climate code Photochem, and benchmark the model against the observed compositions and climates of Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Titan with a single set of kinetics, thermodynamics and opacities. We also model the chemistry of the hot Jupiter exoplanet WASP-39b. All simulations are open-source and reproducible. To first order, Photochem broadly reproduces the gas-phase chemistry and pressure-temperature profiles of all six planets. The largest model-data discrepancies are found in Venus's sulfur chemistry, motivating future experimental work on sulfur kinetics and spacecraft missions to Venus. We also find that clouds and hazes are important for the energy balance of Venus, Earth, Mars and Titan, and that accurately predicting aerosols with Photochem is challenging. Finally, we benchmark Photochem against the popular VULCAN and HELIOS photochemistry and climate models, finding excellent agreement for the same inputs; we also find that Photochem simulates atmospheres 2 to 100 time more efficiently. These results show that Photochem provides a comparatively general description of atmospheric chemistry and physics that can be leveraged to study Solar System worlds or interpret telescope observations of exoplanets.",

      "abstract": "Detecting Secular Perturbations in Kepler Planetary Systems Using Simultaneous Impact Parameter Variation Analysis (SIPVA) Zhixing Liu, Bonan Pu Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Recovering impact parameter variations in multi-planet systems is an effective approach for detecting non-transiting planets and refining planetary mass estimates. Traditionally, two methodologies have been employed: the Individual Fit, which fits each transit independently to analyze impact parameter changes, and the Dynamical Fit, which simulates planetary dynamics to match transit light curves. We introduce a new fitting method, Simultaneous Impact Parameter Variation Analysis (SIPVA), which demonstrates advantages over the Individual Fit and avoids the computational cost of N-body integrations required by the Dynamical Fit. SIPVA directly incorporates a linear time-dependent model for impact parameters into the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework by fitting all transits simultaneously. We evaluate SIPVA and the Individual Fit on artificial systems with varying log-likelihood ratios and find that SIPVA consistently outperforms the Individual Fit in recovery rates and accuracy. When applied to selected Kepler planetary candidates exhibiting significant transit duration variations (TDVs), SIPVA identifies significant impact parameter trends in 10 out of 16 planets, whereas the Individual Fit does so in only 4. We also employ probabilistic modeling to simulate the theoretical distribution of planets with significant impact parameter variations across all observed Kepler systems and compare the distribution of recovered candidates by the Individual Fit and Dynamical Fit from previous work with our theoretical distribution. Our findings offer an alternative framework for analyzing planetary transits, relying solely on Bayesian inference without requiring prior assumptions about the planetary system's dynamical architecture.",

These four high S/N ($\\sim$20) K-band spectra conserve both the pseudo-continuum and molecular absorption patterns. We analyze them with four self-consistent forward model grids (Exo-REM, ATMO, BT-Settl, Sonora) exploring $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, log(g), metallicity, C/O, and $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio. We also upgrade our forward modeling code \\texttt{\\textit{ForMoSA}} to account for the data multi-modality and combine the GRAVITY epochs with published 1-5 $\\mu$m photometry, low- to medium-resolution spectra (0.9-7 $\\mu$m), and high-resolution echelle spectra (2.1-5.2 $\\mu$m). Sonora and Exo-REM are statistically preferred. Exo-REM yields $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ $=1607.45^{+4.85}_{-6.20}$ K and log(g) $=4.46^{+0.02}_{-0.04}$ dex from GRAVITY alone, and $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ $=1502.74^{+2.32}_{-2.14}$ K and log(g) $=4.00\\pm0.01$ dex when including all datasets. Archival data significantly affect the retrieved parameters. C/O remains solar ($0.552^{+0.003}_{-0.002}$) while [M/H] reaches super-solar values (0.50$\\pm$0.01). We report the first tentative constraint on log($^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO) $\\sim$1.12, though this remains inconclusive due to telluric residuals. Additionally, we estimate the luminosity to be log(L/L$_\\odot$) $=-4.01^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$, implying a heavy-element content of up to $\\sim$5% (20-80 M$_\\oplus$) given the system age and dynamical mass measurements. Access to both continuum and molecular lines at K-band significantly impacts the metallicity, possibly owing to collision-induced absorption shaping the continuum. Echelle spectra do not dominate the final fit with respect to lower resolution data. Future multi-modal frameworks should include weighting schemes reflecting bandwidth and central wavelength coverage.",

Ingersoll, Sihe Chen Published in PNAS on Sep. 29, 2025 (this http URL). Movies can be found in this https URL. SI Appendix can be found on PNAS website Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Knowing the composition of Jupiter's atmosphere is crucial for constraining Jupiter's bulk metallicity and formation history. Yet, constraining Jupiter's atmospheric water abundance is challenging due to its potential non-uniform distribution. Here, we explicitly resolve the water hydrological cycle in Jupiter's mid-latitudes using high-resolution simulations. Falling precipitation leads to a significant large-scale depletion of water vapor beneath the lifting condensation level. A non-uniform water vapor distribution emerges in the mid-latitude simulation with a changing Coriolis parameter across latitudes and spatially uniform cooling and heating. Water abundance at the 7-bar level varies by up to a factor of ten across latitudes, from sub-solar to super-solar values. We propose that nonlinear large-scale eddies and waves tend to drift air parcels across latitudes along constant potential vorticity (PV) surfaces, thereby sustaining latitudinal dependencies in water vapor and the interplay between water distribution and large-scale dynamics. Therefore, water distribution is influenced by the vertical structure of density stratification and changing Coriolis parameter across Jupiter's mid-latitudes, as quantified by PV. Additionally, the water hydrological cycle amplifies the specific energy of air parcels through the latent heat effect, thereby slowing down vertical mixing with a latent heat flux. The horizontal gradient of water is expected to be more pronounced with a super-solar water abundance. We suggest that similar interplays between precipitating condensates, planetary rotation, and distribution of condensable species generally exist in the weather layer of fast-rotating giant planets. The ongoing Juno mission and future Uranus mission may further reveal the non-uniform distribution of condensed species and their interplay with large-scale dynamics.",

In 2025, Earth will encounter young trails ejected by the comet in 2005 and 2012, producing a meteor outburst and providing a rare opportunity to probe their structure and benchmark meteoroid stream models. We present predictions from three independent dynamical models (NIMS, MSFC, Sisyphus), calibrated against updated activity profiles including the newly observed 2019 and 2024 outbursts. All simulations predict enhanced activity on 2025 October 8, dominated by faint meteors (m < 0.01 g; +4 mag and fainter) primarily detectable by radar. Our best estimate is a radar outburst near 15:00 - 16:00 UT, driven mainly by the 2012 trail with a possible minor contribution from 2005. The 2025 Draconids may represent one of the strongest radar dominated outbursts of the decade. Coordinated observing campaigns, especially radar measurements across the Northern Hemisphere and optical coverage from Asia, will be essential to validate these forecasts, constrain the dust environment of comet 21P, and improve future predictions of young meteoroid trails.",

Udry Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Understanding the link between outer giant planets (OGPs) and inner light planets (ILPs) is key to understanding planetary system formation and architecture. The correlation between these two populations of planets is debated both theoretically -- different formation models predict either a correlation or an anticorrelation -- and observationally. Several recent attempts to constrain this correlation have yielded contradictory results, due to small-number statistics and heterogeneous samples. We present an ongoing long-term observational effort with CORALIE, HARPS, and ESPRESSO to probe the ILP occurrence in systems with and without OGP. In this first article of a series, we discuss how, from the design to the observations, we ensured the homogeneity of the samples, both in terms of stellar properties and observing strategy. We also present the first three detections of ILPs in our OGP host sample. We find a 8.3 mE planet at 5.75 d around HD 23079, a 10.4 mE planet at 4.6 d around HD 196067, and we confirm the 7.5 mE planet at 3.98 d around HD 86226. While a rigorous statistical analysis of our samples will be performed in subsequent studies, the relatively low number of detections in our sample seems to contradict previous studies that found a strong OGP-ILP correlation.",

Bergin, J. Girard, R. Helled, J. Huang, J. Leisenring Accepted for publication in AJ. 22 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Recent disk observations have revealed multiple indirect signatures of forming gas giant planets, but high-contrast imaging has rarely confirmed the presence of the suspected perturbers. Here, we exploit a unique opportunity provided by the background star AS209bkg, which shines through a wide annular gap in the AS209 disk, to perform transmission spectrophotometry and directly measure the extinction from gap material for the first time. By combining new VLT/SPHERE and JWST/NIRCam observations with archival HST data from 2005, we model the spectral energy distribution (SED) of AS209bkg over a 19-year baseline. We find that the SED and its variability are best explained by increasing extinction along the line of sight as AS209bkg approaches the gap edge in projection. The extinction is best described by a combination of ISM-like extinction component and a grey extinction component. This points to the presence of grains in the disk outer gap that are larger than in the ISM. We find that the extinction in the gap at $\\lambda\\sim4.0~\\mu$m is $A_{4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = 2.7^{+0.7}_{-0.7}$ mag, while at H$\\alpha$ ($\\lambda=0.656~\\mu$m), where most searches for accretion signatures take place, the extinction could be as high as $A_\\mathrm{H\\alpha} = 4.2^{+0.9}_{-1.2}$ mag ($A_V=4.6^{+1.0}_{-1.3}$ mag). This suggests that even wide, deep gaps can significantly obscure emission from protoplanets, even those following a hot-start evolutionary model. Our extinction measurements help reconcile the discrepancy between ALMA-based predictions of planet-disk interactions and the non-detections from sensitive optical and near-infrared imaging campaigns.",

      "abstract": "Modeling the Solar System as an Observed Multi-Transit System I: Characterization Limits from Analytic Timing Variations Bethlee Lindor, Eric Agol 21 pages, 15 figures, submitted to PSJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Planetary systems with multiple transiting planets are beneficial for understanding planet occurrence rates and system architectures. Although we have yet to find a solar system analogue, future surveys may detect multiple terrestrial planets transiting a Sun-like star. In this work, we simulate transit timing observations of our system based on the actual orbital motions of Venus and the Earth+Moon (EM) -- influenced by the other solar system objects -- and retrieve the system's dynamical parameters for varying noise levels and observing durations. Using an approximate coplanar N-body model for transit-time variations, we consider test configurations with 2, 3, and 4 planets. For various observing baselines, we can robustly retrieve the masses and orbits of Venus and EM; detect Jupiter at high significance (for < 90-second timing error and baseline $\\leq$ 15 yrs); and detect Mars at 5 $\\sigma$ confidence (with < 20-second timing error and baseline $\\geq$ 27 yrs) using TTVFaster. We also find that the 3-planet model is generally preferred, and provide equations to estimate the mass precision of Venus/Earth/Jupiter-analogues. The addition of Mars -- which is near a 2:1 mean-motion resonance with Earth -- improves our retrieval of Jupiter's parameters, suggesting that unseen terrestrials could interfere in the characterization of multi-planetary systems. Our findings are comparable to theoretical limits based upon stellar variability and may eventually be possible.",

Noble gases in planetary atmospheres are tracers of their geophysical evolution, and measuring the elemental and isotopic composition of noble gases in the Venus atmosphere informs us about the origin and evolution of the entire planet. In this work we describe a new SmallSat mission concept, Venus ATMOSpheric - Sample Return (VATMOS-SR), that would return gas samples from the upper atmosphere of Venus to Earth for scientific analysis. To ensure it is possible to relate the composition of the sampled gases (acquired when the spacecraft is traveling >10 km/s) to the free stream atmospheric composition, large-scale numerical simulations are employed to model the flow into and through the sampling system. An emphasis is placed on quantifying noble gas elemental and isotopic fractionation that occurs during the sample acquisition and transfer process, to determine how measured isotopic ratios of noble gases in the sample would compare to the actual isotopic ratios in the Venusian atmosphere. We find that lighter noble gases are depleted after they are sampled compared to the freestream conditions, and heavier ones are enriched, due to the high pressure gradients present in the flowfield. Finally, we observe that, in general, the numerical parameters do not have a major impact on the observed fractionation. However, the freestream velocity and density have a major impact on fractionation and need to be precisely known to properly reconstruct the fractionation in the sampling system. We demonstrate that the sample fractionation can be predicted with numerical simulations, and believe that VATMOS-SR, which could be the first mission to bring back samples from another planet, could answer key scientific questions related to understanding the evolution of Venus.",

      "abstract": "Global magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the inner regions of protoplanetary discs. I. Zero-net flux regime Matthew J. O. Roberts, Henrik N. Latter, Geoffroy Lesur Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The inner regions of protoplanetary discs, which encompass the putative habitable zone, are dynamically complex, featuring a well-ionised, turbulent active inner region and a poorly ionised `dead' outer region. In this first paper, we investigate a base-level model of the magnetohydrodynamic processes around the interface between these two regions, using five three-dimensional global magnetohydrodynamic simulations in the zero-net flux regime. We employ physically motivated profiles for Ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion, alongside a simplified thermodynamic model comprising a cool disc and hot corona. Our results show that, first, large-scale coherent poloidal magnetic field loops form in the magnetorotational instability active region. These loops lead to the accumulation of tightly wound magnetic flux at the disc-corona temperature transition, driving strong, localised accretion flows in the surface layers of the active region. Second, an axisymmetric pressure maximum, extending across multiple disc scale heights, develops as a result of outward mass transport from the active region. This, in turn, triggers the Rossby wave instability and leads to the development of anticyclonic vortices. Third, the dead zone develops magnetic field with a distinct morphology, likely resulting from the outward diffusion of the large-scale poloidal loops in the active zone. This self-consistently generated field exhibits a vertical structure that can drive accretion in the inner dead zone via a weak magnetic-pressure wind. In the second paper in the series, we extend this work to the vertical-net flux regime, where global magnetic flux transport and magnetically driven outflows become dynamically significant.",

Understanding its emission mechanisms may enable observations of accretion rates and physical conditions in the circum-planetary environment. We report ALMA observations of PDS 70 at 145 GHz (Band 4), 343.5 GHz (Band 7) and 671 GHz (Band 9) and compare with data at 97.5 GHz (Band 3), taken within two months. The radio spectrum (SED) is analyzed with an analytical circumplanetary disk (CPD) model. In a novel approach including the free-free continuum from H I, metals (e.g. K I) and H-. New detections in Bands 3 (tentative at 2.6sigma), 4 (5sigma), and 7 (re-detected at 9sigma) are consistent with optically thick thermal emission from PDS 70c (spectral index 2+-0.2). However, a Band 9 non-detection lies 2.6sigma below an optically thick extrapolation. A viscous dusty disk is inconsistent with the data, even with the inclusion of ionised jets. Interestingly, the central temperatures in such CPD models are high enough to ionise H I, with huge emission measures and an optically thick spectrum that marginally accounts for the SED (within 3sigma of Band 9). By contrast, uniform-slab models suggest much lower emission measures to account for the Band 9 drop, with ionisation fractions ~1e-7, and an outer radius ~0.1 au. Such conditions are recovered if the CPD interacts with a planetary magnetic field, leading to a radially variable viscosity alpha(R)<~1 and midplane temperatures ~1e3 K that regulate metal ionisation. However, the H- opacity still results in an optically thick SED, overshooting Band 9. We find that the optically thin turnover at ~600 GHz is only recovered if a thin shocked layer is present at the CPD surface, as suggested by simulations. A photospheric shock or accretion funnels are ruled out as radio emission sources because their small solid angles would require T~1e6 K, which is unrealistic for planetary accretion.",

Sagan & E. E. Salpeter 1976), the nature of life in Earth's atmosphere remained widely unknown. Decades later, research has revealed a remarkable variety of microorganisms in our atmosphere. However, the spectral features of airborne microbes as biomarkers for detecting atmospheric life remained a mystery. Here, we present the first reflectance spectra of biopigments of atmospheric microorganisms based on laboratory cultivars of seven microbial strains isolated from Earth's atmosphere. We show their distinct UV-resistant biosignatures and their impacts on models of diverse planetary scenarios, using Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) parameters. The reflectance of these biopigments from aerial bacteria creates the means to detect them on other Earth-like planets. It provides a paradigm shift that moves the search for life beyond the surface of a planet to ecosystems in atmospheres and clouds.",
