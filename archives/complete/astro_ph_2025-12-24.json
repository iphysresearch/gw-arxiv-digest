A large subset of these transient noise artifacts, termed as ``glitches'' for short, trigger BBH search templates. Some of them go on to produce detection candidates and require human vetting, supported by data quality tools, to be correctly identified and vetoed. In its current version, CoBiTS takes as inputs single-detector strain timeseries snippets, claimed by other search pipelines to be containing GW candidates, and outputs the significance of each snippet to contain a BBH signal and a glitch. CoBiTS is shown to be particularly effective in discriminating high-mass BBH signals from blips and scattered light glitches, even when a signal is near concurrent or overlapping with a glitch. The performance of CoBiTS gains from employing Conformer, which is a specialized model that combines convolutional layers and Transformer architecture for sequence modeling tasks. Conformer is especially good at leveraging the strengths of both convolutional layers -- for local feature extraction -- and self-attention layers -- for capturing long-range dependencies.",

Edwards Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det) The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) data stream will inevitably contain gaps due to maintenance and environmental disturbances, introducing nonstationarities and spectral leakage that compromise standard frequency-domain likelihood evaluations. We present a scalable Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) framework capable of robust parameter estimation directly from gapped time-series data. We employ Flow Matching Posterior Estimation (FMPE) conditioned on a learned summary of the data, optimized through an end-to-end training strategy. To address the computational challenges of long-duration signals, we propose a dual-pathway summarizer architecture: a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) operating on the time domain for high precision, and a novel wavelet-based 2D CNN utilizing asymmetric, dilated kernels to achieve scalability for datasets spanning months. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework on simulated Galactic Binary-like signals, showing that our joint training approach yields tighter, unbiased posteriors compared to two-stage reconstruction pipelines. Furthermore, we provide the first systematic comparison showing that FMPE offers superior stability and coverage calibration over conventional Normalizing Flows in the presence of severe data artifacts.",

We explore the physics of GW signals potentially explaining the data, with a primary focus on GW backgrounds (GWBs), considering both astrophysical and cosmological origins. We describe how: (i) An astrophysical nanoHz GWB emerges as the superposition of individual signals from inspiralling massive black-hole binaries (MBHBs); (ii) Environment coupling, eccentricity, and sparse sampling, affect the MBHB signal spectrum and statistical properties, causing great uncertainty in theoretical predictions, but simultaneously offering a handle to discriminate a potential astrophysical origin; (iii) PTA data offers unprecedented opportunities to constrain high-energy physics beyond the standard model, by probing early Universe GWBs, originated during or after inflation; (iv) Different early Universe GWBs, typically created by non-linear and out-of-equilibrium dynamics, can explain the PTA data, as e.g. from inflation scenarios, first order phase transitions, or topological defects; (v) The PTA detection of GWs opens a new window to explore the Universe, with profound implications for astrophysics and particle physics, probing e.g. the equation of state of the early Universe, the origin of the cosmological perturbations, the nature of the dark matter, or whether exotic objects like primordial black holes or cosmic strings exist.",

This parameterization recovers the standard $\\Lambda$CDM scenario and introduces two additional, observationally testable contributions to the dark energy sector, $\\Omega_1(1+z)$ and $\\Omega_2(1+z)^2$, alongside the cosmological constant. Using Planck CMB and DESI BAO data, we find that this framework is suitable for relaxing the Hubble tension. The Planck CMB data alone allow substantial freedom in late-time dynamics, yielding $H_0 = 75.4^{+3.9}_{-2.3}\\;\\mathrm{km\\;s^{-1}\\;Mpc^{-1}}$, fully consistent with distance-ladder measurements from the SH0ES collaboration. When DESI BAO data are included in the analysis, the late-time expansion history becomes more tightly anchored, reducing the $H_0$ discrepancy to $\\sim 2.5\\sigma$ level. This highlights the limited constraining power of currently available low-redshift data measurements, especially in the context of the $\\Omega_1\\Omega_2$-$\\Lambda$CDM model, where dynamical dark energy dominates the background expansion over a relatively large redshift range. The model naturally exhibits a smooth quintessence--phantom transition followed by asymptotic de Sitter behavior of the dark energy equation of state, alters late-time cosmic dynamics, and preserves standard early-universe physics. Overall, our results demonstrate that controlled late-time deviations from $\\Lambda$CDM can improve cosmological concordance.",

While gravitational lensing has been proposed as an explanation, current millilensing studies suggest the signal consists of three overlapping images, a configuration that exceeds the predictions of the isolated point-mass lens model. In this work, we investigate a binary lens model embedded within a strong lensing galaxy. This is the simplest model that not only naturally produces the observed number of images but also aligns with the fact that microlensing objects usually reside in galaxies. To overcome the high computational cost of the diffraction integral required for wave optics, we constructed a Transformer-based neural network that accurately generates lensing waveforms within milliseconds per waveform. Using the NRSur7dq4 waveform model, we find primary and secondary lens masses of $714^{+239}_{-309} \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ and $87^{+139}_{-73} \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$, respectively. We also find a strong lensing magnification of $5.56^{+2.78}_{-1.98}$ (at 90\\% credible intervals) and a Bayes factor of $\\log_{10}B^\\mathrm{Binary}_\\mathrm{Single}\\simeq1.34$. This result underscores the necessity of considering multi-body and environmental effects in microlensing studies. More crucially, under this embedded binary lens interpretation, the inferred source-frame binary black hole masses ($80.0^{+21.3}_{-14.4} \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ and $62.0^{+19.8}_{-29.4} \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$) and spins ($0.37^{+0.51}_{-0.33}$ and $0.40^{+0.52}_{-0.35}$) shift to values consistent with the current population constrained from O1--O3.",

Santos Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We carry out a comparative analysis of the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model and the alternative $R_h=ct$ framework using recent observational data from cosmic chronometers, Type Ia supernova, and baryon acoustic oscillations. The study evaluates the ability of each model to reproduce the observed expansion history of the Universe through a joint statistical assessment based on the chi-squared statistics, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), and Bayes factor. While both models yield acceptable fits, $\\Lambda$CDM consistently attains lower information-criterion values and higher likelihood, indicating a superior overall performance. An examination of the redshift evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ shows that $\\Lambda$CDM naturally captures the transition from early-time deceleration to late-time acceleration, where as $R_h=ct$ predicts a strictly linear expansion. We also estimate the age of the Universe within both models, finding that $\\Lambda$CDM prediction agrees with the Planck 2018 result, while the linear expansion in $R_h=ct$ leads to an older cosmic age. Recent JWST observations of unexpectedly mature high-redshift galaxies have reopened the discussion regarding whether the Universe may be older than implied by the standard model; although these results remain under active investigation, they underscore that fully resolving cosmic evolution may require refinements beyond the concordance paradigm.",

This cross-correlation provides a novel probe of fundamental physics, potentially revealing deviations from the $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm that may not be accessible through electromagnetic observations alone. We describe the considered modified gravity scenarios, the relevant LSS and GW observables, and the synthetic forecast methodology. Our results demonstrate that combining LSS and GWs can significantly enhance constraints on departures from General Relativity, opening a new window for multi-messenger cosmology.

Mustafa High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate a static, spherically symmetric black hole solution arising from Einstein gravity coupled to a confining nonlinear electrodynamics model that reproduces Maxwell theory in the strong-field regime while introducing confinement-like corrections at large distances. The resulting metric function is asymptotically Schwarzschild but carries a characteristic Q^3/(9\\xi^2 r^4) correction, where $Q$ is the magnetic charge and $\\xi$ is the nonlinear electrodynamics parameter, with the conventional Reissner-Nordström term Q^2/r^2 absent. We analyze the horizon structure and construct three-dimensional embedding diagrams to visualize spatial geometry. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we compute the weak-field deflection angle in vacuum, cold plasma, and axion-plasmon media, finding that the nonlinear electromagnetic corrections reduce the total bending compared to Schwarzschild at fixed Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass. The gravitational redshift, Joule-Thomson expansion coefficient, and heat capacity are derived, revealing phase transitions and inversion curves that depend on the model parameters. We obtain closed-form expressions for the photon sphere radius, Lyapunov exponent, and shadow size, demonstrating their sensitivity to Q and $\\xi$ along observable Intensities. Fully relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion show that the confining geometry produces a $\\sim 40\\%$ enhancement in mass accretion rate relative to Schwarzschild and generates quasi-periodic oscillations with stable 3:2 and 2:1 frequency ratios matching observations from black hole X-ray binaries. These results establish the confining nonlinear electrodynamics black hole as a testable model that can reproduce high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation pairs without invoking black hole spin.",

Deng Wang, Olga Mena, Salvatore Capozziello, David Mota Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The detection of a significant deviation from a zero curvature would have profound consequences for inflationary theories and fundamental physics. Relative to high-redshift Planck's CMB measurements, indicating a $\\sim 2\\sigma$ evidence for a closed universe, low-redshift observations of BAO and SN Ia have the advantages of weak dependence on early universe physics, independently observational systematics, and strong redshift dependence of distances in constraining the cosmic curvature. Using the integrated observations from DESI BAO and SN Ia, we find an unexpected $2\\sigma$ evidence for an open universe, regardless of the SN Ia sample employed. When considering DESI, SN Ia and the acoustic scale $\\theta_\\star$ data, the preference for an open universe exceeds the $3\\sigma$ level, reaching $5\\sigma$ for the case of DESY5 Supernovae data. Therefore, low-redshift observations favor an open universe, and this preference persists even when alternative high-redshift priors are adopted. Our results point to the existence of an additional tension between high- and low-redshift observations, present also in non-flat models beyond the minimal $\\Lambda$CDM scheme, thereby challenging the standard inflationary predictions.",

These objects challenge standard models of early galaxy formation and may represent an extreme class of early BH hosts. In this paper, we investigate whether these BHs could have a primordial origin. We first show that the direct formation of these BH masses in the early Universe is excluded by stringent CMB $\\mu$-distortion limits. We then investigate the assembly of massive BHs from lighter, observationally allowed primordial black holes (PBHs) via hierarchical mergers, finding that, although this channel can operate depending on the merger history, it faces challenges in explaining the observations due to the rarity of the required high-redshift dark matter halos. Finally, we estimate gas accretion onto intermediate-mass PBHs, while jointly tracking metallicity evolution, and identify regions of parameter space in which such growth could reproduce the observed properties of LRDs. As a special case, we focus on the strongly lensed source QSO1, whose extremely low metallicity and large mass provide a stringent test of these formation channels.",

However, the standarly adopted definition of fine-tuning has a clear drawback: the more the primordial black hole abundance is small and cosmologically harmless, the larger the parameter space is fine-tuned. A reliable measure of fine-tuning should deliver a large value when the primordial black hole abundance is fine-tuned and at the same time reduce to something close to unity when it encounters typical sensitivity. Motivated by such arguments, we use the (modified version of) Wilson's naturalness criterion for quantifying the fine-tuning and naturalness and we show that the primordial black hole models are not technically unnatural.",

In this study, we focus on the Chameleon dark energy model and numerically solve the Klein-Gordon equation using a shooting algorithm to determine precise initial conditions such that the field rests at effective potential minima today. We perform a comprehensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using a combination of datasets, including Planck, BAO (SDSS and DESI DR2), Pantheon+, and SH$_0$ES. Our analysis shows a mild preference for a higher non-zero dark sector coupling, compared to earlier works on similar models, for two particular combinations of datasets: (i) Planck + DESI DR2 BAO +.Pantheon+, (ii) Planck + SDSS BAO + Pantheon+ + SH$0$ES. Notably, the inclusion of DESI DR2 and SH$0$ES data increases the inferred interaction strength to $\\beta \\sim 0.3$ (68\\% C.L.) and yields weak and positive evidence in favor of the model over $\\Lambda$CDM, with $\\Delta\\chi^2_{\\rm min} = -4.75, -6.41$ and $\\Delta$AIC= $-0.75, -2.41$ respectively. This model remains consistent with a phantom crossing at redshift $z\\sim 0.5$, in agreement with the trend indicated by DESI observations. However, due to the settlement of the scalar field at the minima of the effective potential at the present epoch, the effective dark energy equation of state asymptotically approaches $w_{\\rm eff}\\to -1$. leading to only weak evidence in favor of this model when analyzed using the DESI DR2 dataset.",

However, PBHs in the mass range of $10^{17}$ - $10^{21}$ g remain a viable explanation for all dark matter. In this work, we use observational data from the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) to refine constraints on PBHs within the mass range of $2\\times10^{16}$ - $5\\times10^{17}$ g. Our analysis explores three scenarios: directly using observational data, incorporating the astrophysical background model (ABM), and employing the power-law spectrum with an exponential cutoff. Our results indicate that although Insight-HXMT does not have an advantage in the first two scenarios, when considering the power-law model, its exceptional sensitivity in the hard X-ray regime and sufficiently high upper energy limit significantly strengthen the constraints on PBHs with masses greater than $10^{17}$ g compared to previous limits. Furthermore, the exclusion limit for PBHs as dark matter has reached $4\\times10^{17}$ g, which is comparable to the current threshold.",

We explore the cosmological constraints on the massive sterile neutrinos using the latest observational data, including the baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI, the cosmic microwave background data from Planck satellite and ACT, and the 5-year Type Ia supernova data and the 3-year weak-lensing data from DES. We search for the massive sterile neutrinos within the $\\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM models. Our analysis shows that when considering massive sterile neutrinos within the $w_0w_a\\rm CDM$ model, the combined datasets allow us to infer a non-zero sterile neutrino mass at approximately $2\\sigma$ confidence level. Specifically, in the $w_0w_a$CDM+Sterile model, the effective mass of sterile neutrinos and the effective number of relativistic species are constrained to be $m_{\\nu,\\ \\mathrm{sterile}}^{\\mathrm{eff}} = 0.50^{+0.33}_{-0.27} \\, \\mathrm{eV}$ and $N_\\mathrm{eff} = 3.076^{+0.011}_{-0.017}$, respectively.

D Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate the scenario of interacting dark energy through a detailed confrontation with various observational datasets. We quantify the interaction in a general way, through the deviation from the standard scaling of the dark matter energy density. We use the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck 2018, data from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the recently released DESI DR2, observational Hubble Data from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), and finally various Supernova Type Ia (SNIa) datasets (PantheonPlus, Union3 and DESY5).

D 112, 123030 (2025) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) X-ray reflection spectroscopy has evolved as one of the leading methods to measure black hole spins. However, the question is whether its measurements are subjected to systematic biases, especially considering the possible discrepancy between the spin measurements inferred with this technique and those from gravitational wave observations. In this work, we use general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of thin accretion disks around spinning black holes for modeling the accretion process, and then we simulate NuSTAR observations to test the capability of modern reflection models in recovering the input spins. For the first time, we model the electron density and ionization profiles from GRMHD-simulated disks. Our study reveals that current reflection models work well only for fast-rotating black holes. We model the corona as the base of the jet and we find that reflection models with lamppost emissivity profiles fail to recover the correct black hole spins. Reflection models with broken power-law emissivity profiles perform better. As we increase the complexity of the simulated models, it is more difficult to recover the correct input spins, pointing toward the need to update our current reflection models with more advanced accretion disks and coronal geometries.",

      "abstract": "Popular Physics (physics.pop-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph) What does ``Big Bang'' actually mean? What was the origin of these two words? It has often been said that the expression ``Big Bang'' began as an insult. Even if this were true, it would be just an irrelevant part of the whole issue. There are many more aspects hidden under this name, and which are seldom explained. They will be discussed in this work. In order to frame the analysis, help will be sought from the highly authoritative voices of two exceptional writers: William Shakespeare and Umberto Eco. Both Shakespeare and Eco have explored the tension existing between words and the realities they name. With the conclusion that names are, in general, just labels, simple stickers put to identify things. And this includes those given to great theorems or spectacular discoveries. Stigler's law of eponymy is recalled to further substantiate those statements. These points will be at the heart of the investigation carried out here, concerning the very important concept of ``Big Bang''. Everybody thinks to know what ``the Big Bang'' is, but only very few do know it, in fact. When Fred Hoyle first pronounced these two words together, on a BBC radio program, listeners were actually left with the false image that Hoyle was trying to destroy. That is, the tremendous explosion of Lemaître's primeval atom (or cosmic egg), which scattered all its enormous matter and energy content throughout the rest of the Universe. This image is absolutely wrong! As will be concluded, today the label ``Big Bang'' is used in several different contexts: (a) the Big Bang Singularity; (b) as the equivalent of cosmic inflation; (c) speaking of the Big Bang cosmological model; (d) to name a very popular TV program; and more.",

Grant Roberts, Aarna Garg, Tesla Jeltema, Stefano Profumo Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We predict the effective clustering bias parameter, $b_{\\rm{eff}}$, at $z\\sim5$ for Little Red Dots (LRDs) seeded by Ultra-Strongly Self-Interacting Dark Matter (uSIDM). From our model, we find that $b_{\\rm{eff}}\\sim4.5$, thus we infer that LRDs seeded by uSIDM would populate halos of typical masses $\\sim 8\\times10^{10}~M_{\\odot}$; this bias factor is consistent with LRDs being a distinct population from high redshift quasars. To the extent that we are aware, this is the first formation-based theoretical prediction of LRD clustering from a model consistent with the LRD mass function. We find that this bias and clustering is insensitive to a wide range of the underlying uSIDM microphysics parameters, including the uSIDM cross-section $\\sigma/m$ and uSIDM fraction $f$. This is therefore a robust prediction from the uSIDM model, and will allow for direct probes of the uSIDM paradigm as the origin of LRDs in the next few years. Upcoming \\texttt{JWST} observations will constrain the population of LRDs, including directly measuring their clustering.",

This algorithm assured one of having the correct correlations if measured about these specific centers. Here, we show that this algorithm was more general than initially believed, and can in fact be used to produce a density field on a grid that has the correct, desired NPCFs as measured about \\textit{every} point on the grid. This paper should be considered the second in the series, and now completes the quest to generalize the idea of ``constrained realization'' (Hoffman and Ribak 1991) to higher-order statistics. This algorithm will be of great use for quickly generating density fields both to produce covariance matrices, and test systematics, for current and future 3D large-scale structure surveys such as Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), Euclid, Spherex, and Roman.",

We follow up on previous work by POLARBEAR using 90 GHz band data of the 2023 observing season of the Simons Array to evaluate the variability of Tau A's polarization angle. Tau A is widely used as a polarization angle calibration source in millimeter-wave astronomy, and thus it is necessary to validate the stability. Additionally, an interesting application of the time-resolved polarimetry of Tau A is to search for axion-like particles (ALPs). We do not detect a global signal across the frequencies considered in this analysis and place a median 95% upper bound of polarization oscillation amplitude $A<0.12^{\\circ}$ over oscillation frequencies from 3.39 year$^{-1}$ to 1.50 day$^{-1}$.

Weller 30 pages, 8 figures, to be submitted to JCAP Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We use weak gravitational lensing measurements from Year 3 Dark Energy Survey data to calibrate the masses of 443 galaxy clusters selected via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect from Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 5 maps of the cosmic microwave background. We incorporate redshift and SZ measurements for individual clusters into a hierarchical model for the stacked lensing signals and perform Bayesian analyses to constrain the hydrostatic mass bias of the clusters. Our treatment of systematic uncertainties includes a prescription for measuring and accounting for the weak lensing boost factor, consideration of a miscentering effect, as well as marginalization over uncertainties in the source galaxy photometric redshift distributions and shear calibration. The resultant constraints on the normalization of the mass-observable relation have a precision of approximately 7\\%, with the mean WL halo mass of $M_{\\rm 500c} = 5.4 \\times 10^{14} M_{\\odot}$. We measure the bias between the true cluster mass and the mass estimated from the SZ signal based on an X-ray--calibrated scaling relation assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, to be $1-b = 0.75^{+0.04}_{-0.06}$ over the full sample. When splitting the clusters into high ($z$=0.43-0.70) and low ($z$=0.15-0.43) redshift bins, we measure $1-b = 0.58^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ and $0.82^{+0.07}_{-0.07}$, respectively. When introducing additional freedom in redshift and mass to the hydrostatic bias model, we find that $1-b$ decreases with redshift (with the power law of $-2.0^{+0.7}_{-0.4}$, 99.95\\% confidence), consistent with findings from other recent studies, while we do not find any significant trend in mass. We also demonstrate that our result is robust against various systematics. The weak-lensing mass calibration presented in this study will be a useful tool for using the ACT clusters as probes of astrophysics and cosmology.",

Nikogosyan Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) It is shown that, owing to the interaction of baryonic matter with the carrier of dark energy, all configurations of baryonic matter acquire energy and inevitably must expand. This conclusion applies to all hierarchical levels of the baryonic universe, including galaxy clusters. We propose a simple statistical method for identifying possible radial motions of galaxies within clusters. To illustrate this method, we examined the structural features of the Virgo galaxy cluster and identified its substructure, comprising groups of galaxies of varying multiplicity. Galaxies in the substructure are somewhat brighter than those in the overall cluster, and each subgroup contains an active galaxy. Subgroups are considered to be the product of primordial ejections of matter from the central generator galaxy. It is shown that the average stellar magnitude of galaxies in subgroups positively correlates with their average velocity. This correlation can be interpreted as evidence of cluster expansion.",

This allows studying their morphological properties, required to understand their origin, at unprecedentedly high resolution (~2.3 kpc), crucial to disentangle the different cosmic ray components that populate the Original TRG. We produced a LOFAR-VLBI map at 1.5\" resolution using the wide-field technique with 56 hours of observations. This was the first time this technique was used for a galaxy cluster, especially for such deep observations. uGMRT and VLA data have been calibrated and imaged to produce spectral index maps and to apply further techniques to extract additional information, such as the radiative ages of the filaments or their equipartition magnetic field. Polarization information was also obtained using VLA through the rotation measure synthesis technique. Thanks to the LOFAR-VLBI wide-field image at 144 MHz, we revealed additional, very steep ($\\alpha > 2$) filaments beyond those attached to the radio galaxy, extending for around 250 kpc and previously known as the Trail. Combining LOFAR-VLBI with uGMRT and VLA, we found integrated spectral values between 1.1-1.7 for the filaments. Spectral analysis revealed also that the Original TRG has a complex structure, showing overlapping features with distinct spectral indices that extend throughout its tail. Polarized emission emerges only from the tail and the brightest part of the filaments, with values up to $22\\%$. Although there is no clear scenario regarding the formation of filaments, we highlight the importance of the Original TRG as the main driver of such structures, even at larger distances from the core.",

We investigate the prospects for measuring low-redshift Ly$\\alpha$ correlations with the UV slitless spectroscopic instrument of the China Space Station Telescope (CSST). We construct mock CSST quasar spectra that reproduce the expected survey depth, spectral resolution and noise properties, and derive Ly$\\alpha$ auto-correlation functions and cross-correlations with quasars (QSO) and emission-line galaxies (ELG) in the range $1.1 < z < 2.0$. We then interpret these three-dimensional correlation functions with a standard anisotropic redshift-space clustering model and obtain forecast constraints on the Ly$\\alpha$ and tracer parameters. At an effective redshift $z_{\\rm eff}=1.59$ (1.58 for ELGs), the Ly$\\alpha$ bias parameters will be measured with a 10-30\\% precision, depending on priors on other tracer's biases. We also forecast a marginal $2.5\\sigma$ ($3.7\\sigma$) detection of the BAO feature, corresponding to a $\\sim$10\\% (7\\%) constraint on the isotropic BAO scale, from the combination of Ly$\\alpha$ auto- and Ly$\\alpha$-QSO (ELG) cross-correlations.

Code available from this https URL Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Machine Learning (stat.ML) The search for primordial gravitational waves is a central goal of cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys. Isolating the characteristic $B$-mode polarization signal sourced by primordial gravitational waves is challenging for several reasons: the amplitude of the signal is inherently small; astrophysical foregrounds produce $B$-mode polarization contaminating the signal; and secondary $B$-mode polarization fluctuations are produced via the conversion of $E$ modes. Current and future low-noise, multi-frequency observations enable sufficient precision to address the first two of these challenges such that secondary $B$ modes will become the bottleneck for improved constraints on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves. The dominant source of secondary $B$-mode polarization is gravitational lensing by large scale structure. Various strategies have been developed to estimate the lensing deflection and to reverse its effects the CMB, thus reducing confusion from lensing $B$ modes in the search for primordial gravitational waves. However, a few complications remain. First, there may be additional sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization, for example from patchy reionization or from cosmic polarization rotation. Second, the statistics of delensed CMB maps can become complicated and non-Gaussian, especially when advanced lensing reconstruction techniques are applied. We previously demonstrated how a deep learning network, ResUNet-CMB, can provide nearly optimal simultaneous estimates of multiple sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization. In this paper, we show how deep learning can be applied to estimate and remove multiple sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization, and we further show how this technique can be used in a likelihood analysis to produce nearly optimal, unbiased estimates of the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves.",

In order to fully capture time non-locality up to sixth order, we must take into account that every field can contribute non-locally from a separate time in the past. Starting from the general non-local-in-time expression for the galaxy overdensity, we explicitly compute the complete sixth-order basis of bias operators at leading order in spatial derivatives, finding 57 independent biases, compared to 46 in the corresponding local-in-time expansion. As previously found at fifth order, this difference implies that higher-order clustering statistics can distinguish between local- and non-local-in-time galaxy formation, and thus are sensitive, at a single redshift, to the formation time of galaxies. Along the way, we obtain recursion relations for the perturbative kernels and show that they satisfy specific multi-leg soft limits when the sum of a subset of the external momenta goes to zero.",

The first model, Wess-Zumino dark radiation (WZDR), features a mass threshold in the dark sector that induces a step-like reduction in the dark radiation abundance as the dark temperature evolves. The second model, new atomic dark matter (nuADaM), introduces dark radiation that remains coupled to a subcomponent of dark matter until shortly before matter-radiation equality. Earlier analyses using Planck data demonstrated that these interactions significantly relax constraints on the dark radiation density and allow values of $H_0$ consistent with local distance-ladder determinations. Incorporating ACT DR6, which extends CMB measurements deep into the high-$\\ell$ damping tail, we find that constraints on the additional radiation component tighten substantially in both scenarios, closing most of the parameter space that previously enabled higher values of $H_0$. We further analyze a generalized model including both free-streaming and self-interacting dark radiation, and show that the resulting constraints are consistent with ACT's findings for the limiting cases of purely free-streaming or purely self-interacting radiation. Overall, ACT DR6 significantly restricts interacting dark radiation as a solution to the Hubble tension.",

Padilla Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We discuss how helium sedimentation in galaxy clusters can affect the history of star formation in the central cluster galaxy. As helium sediments, the gas density in the inner regions of the cluster increases and there is also a non-trivial, radially dependent redistribution of the atomic nuclei and electrons. As a result, the cooling rate in the center increases and this can enhance star formation. On the other hand, there is a slow contraction of the intracluster gas, which may induce gravitational heating and therefore has an opposite effect on star formation. In this work we present these effects and aim to estimate their relevance. For this we have performed a 1-dimensional numerical simulation of helium sedimentation and applied it to a simple semi-analytical model of star formation. We find that for clusters with a halo mass $M_{\\rm halo} \\lesssim 10^{14} M_{\\rm sun}$, helium sedimentation effects on the star formation rate are negligible, even under idealized conditions. In the intermediate range, $10^{14} M_{\\rm sun} \\lesssim M_{\\rm halo} \\lesssim 10^{15} M_{\\rm sun}$, the effects are at most mild, below a factor ~ 2 in the isothermal model we consider, even for idealized conditions. For clusters with a halo mass $M_{\\rm halo} \\gtrsim 10^{15} M_{\\rm sun}$, helium sedimentation effects can potentially be very important and renew star formation activity in the central galaxy.",

Nino Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We report the discovery of a positive correlation between supermassive black hole mass and dark matter halo concentration at fixed halo mass in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Analyzing central galaxies in TNG100 (N = 18,954), EAGLE (N = 1,522), and CAMELS-TNG (N = 6,664), we find partial correlation coefficients of r = +0.24, +0.34, and +0.66 respectively, all highly significant (p < 10^-10). The correlation is absent in SIMBA (r = +0.01, p = 0.09), which employs a torque-limited black hole accretion model rather than the Bondi-based prescription used by the other simulations. Both TNG and EAGLE exhibit a mass-dependent sign transition: the correlation is negative or null at log(M200/Msun) < 11.5 but strongly positive at higher masses. We interpret this pattern as reflecting the coupling between Bondi accretion rates and central gas density structure: halos with higher concentration have denser cores, enabling more efficient black hole growth at fixed halo mass. The absence of the correlation in torque-limited models supports this interpretation. These results suggest that halo concentration may be a fundamental parameter governing black hole-galaxy coevolution.",

If such self interactions are large enough, they could leave an imprint on the morphology of galaxies. These effects can be studied with numerical simulations, which serve as the primary tool to predict the non-linear evolution of galactic structure. A standard assumption is that the course-grained phase-space distribution of the macroscopic simulation particles follows the same evolution equation as that of the fundamental dark matter particles. This Letter tests this assumption directly for the case of frequent dark matter scatterings, demonstrating that this is not generically true. Specifically, we develop a first-principles map from a microscopic particle physics description of self-interacting dark matter to a representation of macroscopic simulation particles for theories in the short-mean-free-path regime. Using this procedure, we show the emergence of an effective force between the simulation particles and derive their interaction cross section, which depends on the one from fundamental particle physics. This work provides the first explicit map from particle physics to simulation, which will facilitate exploring the phenomenological implications for galactic dynamics.",

Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) powers active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and drives feedback that shapes galaxy evolution. Constraining AGN accretion disk structure is therefore essential for understanding black hole growth and feedback processes. However, direct constraints on disk size remain rare -- particularly from long-term, multi-season spectroscopic reverberation mapping (RM), which is critical for isolating the intrinsic disk response from the broad-line region (BLR). We present results from an intensive multi-wavelength RM campaign of NGC 4151 during its brightest state in nearly two decades. This represents the third high-cadence monitoring over the past decade, capturing accretion states spanning the transitional regime between thin and thick disks, making NGC 4151 the only AGN with continuum RM observations across such a wide range in accretion states. Combining spectroscopy from the Lijiang 2.4 m telescope with coordinated Swift UV/X-ray monitoring, we measure inter-band continuum lags from UV to optical. The wavelength-dependent lags follow a tight $\\tau \\propto \\lambda^{4/3}$ relation, consistent with reprocessing in a thin disk, but exceed theoretical predictions by a factor of 6.6. Our lag spectrum reveals clear excesses near the Balmer and possibly Paschen jumps, confirming diffuse continuum (DC) contamination from the BLR. By comparing the three campaigns, we discover a non-monotonic lag-luminosity trend ($>3\\sigma$), which cannot be explained by DC emission alone. We propose the lags reflect combined disk and BLR contributions, and present the first evidence that the DC component follows an intrinsic Baldwin effect. These results offer new insights into SMBH mass measurements and theoretical models of AGN inner structure.",

Zou 21 pages, 7 figures, 1 table; submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The intergalactic medium (IGM) around quasars is shaped by their dense environments and by their excess ionizing radiation, forming a \"quasar proximity zone\" whose size and anisotropy depend on the quasar's halo mass, luminosity, age, and radiation geometry. Using over 10,000 quasar pairs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Year 1 data, with projected comoving separations $r_{\\perp} < 2\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$, we investigate how the proximity zone of foreground quasars at $z\\sim2{\\rm-}3.5$ affects Lyman-alpha absorption in their background quasars. The large DESI sample enables unprecedented precision in measuring this \"transverse proximity\" effect, allowing a detailed investigation of the signal's dependence on the projected separation of quasar pairs and the luminosity of the foreground quasar. We find that enhanced gas clustering near quasars dominates over their ionizing effect, leading to stronger absorption on neighboring sightlines. Under the assumption that quasar ionizing luminosity is isotropic and steady, we infer the IGM overdensity profile in the vicinity of quasars, finding overdensities as high as $\\Delta \\sim 10$ at comoving distance $\\sim 1\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ from the most luminous systems. Surprisingly, however, we find no significant dependence of the proximity profile on the luminosity of the foreground quasar. This lack of luminosity dependence could reflect a cancellation between higher ionizing flux and higher gas overdensity, or it could indicate that quasar emission is highly time variable or anisotropic, so that the observed luminosity does not trace the ionizing flux on nearby sightlines.",

The binary neutron star merger GW170817 delivered the first such measurement of the Hubble constant, demonstrating that GWs offer a path to precision cosmology with systematics orthogonal to standard cosmological probes. To convert GW distances into cosmological parameters, redshift information is essential. To maximize the scientific potential, the redshift must be obtained from individual galaxies, either by identifying electromagnetic counterparts of GW events (bright sirens) or by statistically associating potential hosts within the GW localization volume (dark sirens). The precision of these redshifts sets the achievable accuracy. Forecasts show that photometric uncertainties degrade cosmological constraints by up to an order of magnitude compared to spectroscopic ones. Wide-field, high-multiplex spectroscopic facilities will therefore be an essential infrastructure for GW cosmology in the 2040s.",

Douglass, Regina Demina 18 pages, 16 figures, submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR), a relationship between rotational velocity and baryonic mass in spiral galaxies, probes the relative content of baryonic and dark matter in galaxies and thus provides a good test of Lambda CDM. Using H-alpha kinematics to model the rotation curves of spiral galaxies, we construct the BTFR for 5743 SDSS MaNGA DR17 galaxies. To extend the BTFR to higher masses using elliptical galaxies, we estimate their total masses from their stellar velocity dispersions using the virial theorem and define the effective rotational velocity as the velocity a rotation-supported galaxy would exhibit given this mass. The baryonic mass of spiral galaxies is composed of stellar, HI, H2, and He mass, while only the stellar mass is used for the baryonic content of ellipticals. We construct and fit the BTFR for a matched subsample of spiral and elliptical MaNGA and IllustrisTNG 100-1 (TNG100) galaxies, finding BTFR slopes between 3.2 and 4.0. We fit a joint BTFR for the 5743 MaNGA spiral and elliptical galaxies and find a BTFR slope of 3.54 (+0.65/-0.48), which is in good agreement with TNG100 galaxies with baryonic masses greater than 10^9 Msun for which we find a BTFR slope of 3.57 (+0.48/-0.37). Within this mass range, the MaNGA galaxies are consistent with both the Lambda CDM simulation and the prediction from MOND; a sample of lower mass galaxies is necessary to differentiate between the two models.",

Vivian Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex) The PTOLEMY project is prototyping a novel electromagnetic filter for high-precision $\\beta$ spectroscopy, with the ultimate and ambitious long-term goal of detecting the cosmic neutrino background through electron capture on tritium bound to graphene. Intermediate small-scale prototypes can achieve competitive sensitivity to the effective neutrino mass, even with reduced energy resolution. To reach an energy resolution better than \\SI{500}{meV} at the tritium $\\beta$-spectrum endpoint of \\SI{18.6}{keV}, and accounting for all uncertainties in the filtering chain, the electrode voltage must be controlled at the level of a few parts per million and monitored in real time. In this work, we present the first results obtained in this effort, using a chain of commercial ultra-high-precision voltage references, read out by precision multimeters and a \\emph{field mill} device. The currently available precision on high voltage is, in the conservative case, as low as \\SI{0.2}{ppm} per \\SI{1}{kV} single board and $\\lesssim$ \\SI{50}{mV} over the \\SI{10}{kV} series, presently limited by field mill read-out noise. However, assuming uncorrelated Gaussian noise extrapolation, the real precision could in principle be as low as \\SI{0.05}{ppm} over \\SI{20}{kV}.",

Cosmological likelihood data and lensing maps are here: this https URL ; likelihood software is here: this https URL . Also see companion papers Madhavacheril et al and MacCrann et al Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present new measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing over $9400$ sq. deg. of the sky. These lensing measurements are derived from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6) CMB dataset, which consists of five seasons of ACT CMB temperature and polarization observations. We determine the amplitude of the CMB lensing power spectrum at $2.3\\%$ precision ($43\\sigma$ significance) using a novel pipeline that minimizes sensitivity to foregrounds and to noise properties. To ensure our results are robust, we analyze an extensive set of null tests, consistency tests, and systematic error estimates and employ a blinded analysis framework. The baseline spectrum is well fit by a lensing amplitude of $A_{\\mathrm{lens}}=1.013\\pm0.023$ relative to the Planck 2018 CMB power spectra best-fit $\\Lambda$CDM model and $A_{\\mathrm{lens}}=1.005\\pm0.023$ relative to the $\\text{ACT DR4} + \\text{WMAP}$ best-fit model. From our lensing power spectrum measurement, we derive constraints on the parameter combination $S^{\\mathrm{CMBL}}_8 \\equiv \\sigma_8 \\left({\\Omega_m}/{0.3}\\right)^{0.25}$ of $S^{\\mathrm{CMBL}}_8= 0.818\\pm0.022$ from ACT DR6 CMB lensing alone and $S^{\\mathrm{CMBL}}_8= 0.813\\pm0.018$ when combining ACT DR6 and Planck NPIPE CMB lensing power spectra. These results are in excellent agreement with $\\Lambda$CDM model constraints from Planck or $\\text{ACT DR4} + \\text{WMAP}$ CMB power spectrum measurements. Our lensing measurements from redshifts $z\\sim0.5$--$5$ are thus fully consistent with $\\Lambda$CDM structure growth predictions based on CMB anisotropies probing primarily $z\\sim1100$. We find no evidence for a suppression of the amplitude of cosmic structure at low redshifts",

Recently in\\,\\cite{Donath:2023sav}, it was shown that time non-locality emerges in bias tracer fluctuations, which are $SO(3)$ scalars in real space, at fifth order in the perturbation expansion in dark matter overdensity. We demonstrate that by breaking the symmetry down to $SO(2)$, which is the case whenever line-of-sight effects become important, such as for flux fluctuations in the Lyman $\\alpha$ forest, the temporal non-locality appears at the third order in expansion. Additionally, within the framework of EFTofLSS, we demonstrate that time non-locality manifests in the effective stress tensor of dark matter, which is a second rank tensor under $SO(3)$ transformations, again at the third order in dark matter overdensity. Furthermore, we highlight the effectiveness of the standard $\\Pi$ basis\\,\\cite{Mirbabayi:2014zca} in handling time non-local operators.",

      "abstract": "Modeling and measuring the anisotropic halo 3-point correlation function: a coordinated study Antonio Farina, Alfonso Veropalumbo, Enzo Branchini, Massimo Guidi Accepted for publication in JCAP Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Ongoing and future spectroscopic galaxy surveys will cover unprecedented volumes with a number of objects large enough to effectively probe clustering anisotropies through higher-order statistics. In this work, we present a novel and efficient implementation of both a model for the multipole moments of the anisotropic 3-point correlation function (3PCF) and of their estimator. To evaluate the performance of our model, we compared its predictions against direct 3PCF measurements obtained with our estimator from a set of 298 dark matter halo catalogs drawn from the $z=1$ snapshots of $N$-body simulations. For the statistical analysis, we employed a covariance matrix estimated from an independent suite of 3000 mock halo catalogs at the same redshift. We then repeated the analysis by combining the 2-point correlation function (2PCF) to the 3PCF, with and without including its anisotropic part. In the 3PCF-only analysis, the addition of the anisotropic component of the 3PCF effectively breaks the degeneracy between the growth rate $f$ and the linear bias $b_1$, significantly reducing their uncertainties. It also significantly improves the precision of the Alcock-Paczynski parameter $\\varepsilon$ but does not reduce the $\\sim 1$% offset we find in the estimate of the isotropic dilation parameter $\\alpha$. The joint 2PCF+3PCF analysis reduces, though does not fully remove, biases in the AP and isotropic dilation parameters and breaks the $f$-$b_1$-$\\sigma_8$ degeneracy, leading to tighter constraints overall. The anisotropic 3PCF adds little to the joint analysis because the tree-level 3PCF model fails to capture the anisotropic information primarily encoded on small scales and in squeezed triangle configurations. A more advanced model will be required to exploit this information fully.",

      "abstract": "Multi-copy Axion Transfer Function and Observational Implications of Effective de Broglie Scales Jiashuo Zhang, Tom Broadhurst, Jeremy Lim, Paloma Morilla, Sung Kei Li Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Ultra-light axions are viable fuzzy/wave-like dark matter ($\\psi $DM) candidates generically predicted by the String Axiverse paradigm with multiple particle copies, whereas most of the discussions/constraints on $\\psi $DM from astronomical observations to date are based on the assumption of a single particle copy. Here, we aim to complete this gap by exploring the generic multi-axion scenario motivated in the String Axiverse context, and investigate its astronomical implications in both the linear and nonlinear regimes. In the linear regime, with linear density perturbation analysis, we provide a simplified prescription for obtaining multi-copy axion transfer functions and also identify an \"equivalence\" among all axion copies owing to the mutual coupling to the gravitational potential. As a result of this 'equivalence', we argue the suppression to LSS is governed by an effective mass $m_{eff}^{-2}=\\sum_i w_i m_i^{-2}$, with $\\{ w_i\\}$ being fractional contributions of different copies to the full cosmic dark matter density. In non-linear regime within galaxy halos, we show that similar notions of effective mass, with expressions provided, to govern the collective wave interference and hence determine the net stellar heating rates and the substructure-induced spread of JWST transients near critical curves. Distinctive to the multi-copy scenario, the effective mass within galaxy halos is generically anticipated to be radially decreasing following the stronger concentration of heavier copies to the galactic center. Such a spatial variation leads to radially increasing spreading scales for micro-lensed transients at different radial positions, a signature that may be tested with future JWST lensing observations.",

Building on previous work, our analysis incorporated new deflector stellar velocity dispersions measured from spectra obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Keck Telescopes, and the Very Large Telescope (VLT), utilizing improved methods. We used integrated JWST stellar kinematics for 5 lenses, VLT-MUSE for 2, and resolved kinematics from Keck and JWST for RXJ1131-1231. We also considered two samples of non-time-delay lenses: 11 from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) sample with Keck-KCWI resolved kinematics; and 4 from the Strong Lenses in the Legacy Survey (SL2S) sample. We improved our analysis of line-of-sight effects, the surface brightness profile of the lens galaxies, and orbital anisotropy, and corrected for projection effects in the dynamics. Our uncertainties are maximally conservative by accounting for the mass-sheet degeneracy in the deflectors' mass density profiles. The analysis was blinded to prevent experimenter bias. Our primary result is based on the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, in combination with $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ constraints from the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae (SN) dataset. In the flat $\\Lambda$ cold dark matter (CDM), we find $H_0=71.6^{+3.9}_{-3.3}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The SLACS and SL2S samples are in excellent agreement with the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, improving the precision on $H_0$ in flat $\\Lambda$CDM to 4.6%. Using the Dark Energy Survey SN Year-5 dataset (DES-SN5YR) or DESI-DR2 baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) likelihoods instead of Pantheon+ yields very similar results. We also present constraints in the open $\\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, $w_0w_a$CDM, and $w_{\\phi}$CDM cosmologies. The TDCOSMO $H_0$ inference is robust and consistent across all presented cosmological models, and our cosmological constraints in them agree with those from the BAO and SN.",

For a given smoothing scale, however, that information is not evenly distributed throughout the smoothed field. We investigate which parts of the field contain the most information by smoothing and splitting the field into different levels of density (using the formalism of indicator functions), deriving analytic expressions for the information content of each density bin in the joint-probability distribution (given a distance separation). When we choose one particular distance regime (i.e., cells separated by $60$-$80h^{-1}$ Mpc), we find that the information in that range peaks at moderately rare densities (where the number of smoothed survey cells is roughly of order of magnitude 100). Counter-intuitively, we find that, for a finite survey volume (again at a particular distance range), indicator function analysis can outperform conventional two-point statistics while using only a fraction of the total survey cells, and we explain why. In light of recent developments in marked statistics (such as the indicator power spectrum and density-split clustering), this result elucidates how to optimize sampling for effective extraction of cosmological information.",

Published in Astronomy and Astrophysics (A&A) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Systematic effects that limit the achievable sensitivity of current low-frequency radio telescopes to the 21 cm signal are among the foremost challenges in observational 21 cm cosmology. The standard approach to retrieving the 21 cm signal from radio interferometric data separates it from bright astrophysical foregrounds by exploiting their spectrally smooth nature, in contrast to the finer spectral structure of the 21 cm signal. Contaminants exhibiting rapid frequency fluctuations, on the other hand, are difficult to separate from the 21 cm signal using standard techniques, and the power from these contaminants contributes to low-level systematics that can limit our ability to detect the 21 cm signal. Many of these low-level systematics are incoherent across multiple nights of observation, resulting in an incoherent excess variance above the thermal noise sensitivity of the instrument. In this paper, we develop a method called cross-GPR (cross covariance Gaussian process regression) that exploits the incoherence of these systematics to separate them from the 21 cm signal, which remains coherent across multiple nights of observation. We first develop and demonstrate the technique on synthetic signals in a general setting, and then apply it to gridded interferometric visibility cubes. We perform realistic simulations of visibility cubes containing foregrounds, 21 cm signal, noise, and incoherent systematics. The simulations show that the method can successfully separate and subtract incoherent contributions to the excess variance, and its advantages over standard techniques become more evident when the spectral behavior of the contaminants resembles that of the 21 cm signal. Simulations performed on a variety of 21 cm signal shapes also reveal that the cross-GPR approach can subtract incoherent contributions to the excess variance, without suppressing the 21 cm signal.",

However, galaxy catalogs are intrinsically incomplete due to observational limitations, potentially leaving host galaxies undetected, thereby weakening constraints and potentially introducing systematic errors. In this work, we present a self-consistent framework to study catalog incompleteness and host weighting effects, implemented in the publicly available CHIMERA pipeline. We obtain joint cosmological and astrophysical population constraints from 100 binary black hole (BBH) events in a LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O5-like configuration using spectroscopic galaxy catalogs with varying completeness levels and stellar-mass host weighting schemes. We find percent-level constraints on $H_0$ with complete catalogs, reaching precisions of 1.6%, 1.3%, and 0.9% for constant, linear, and quadratic mass weighting, respectively. As completeness decreases, the precision degrades following a sigmoid trend, with a threshold and steepness that increase for stronger weightings. Simultaneously, the correlation between $H_0$ and the BBH population mass scale increases, making results more sensitive to assumptions about the astrophysical population. Remarkably, 2% precision remains achievable even when catalogs contain only 50% of the potential host galaxies within the gravitational wave detection horizon, while 1% precision requires host probabilities scaling with stellar mass squared. The results are robust against host weighting mismodeling, even at moderate completeness levels. This work further highlights the importance of spectroscopic galaxy surveys in standard siren cosmology and provides a pathway for developing the science case of future facilities.",

It is now possible to directly measure the apparent drift of high-redshift astronomical sources across the sky $\\textit{in real time}$. This so-called $\\textit{position drift}$ provides a valuable probe of the peculiar velocity field and cosmic structure formation by giving direct access to the transverse velocity, which is notoriously difficult to measure and is typically inferred statistically from the density field in a model-dependent way. To fully exploit this new window into the Universe, it is essential to understand how cosmological structures affect position drift measurements. Here we present the first position drift study based on the general relativistic N-body simulation code $\\texttt{gevolution}$. We calculate the position drift directly from the past light cone for ten different observers and compare the results to predictions from linear perturbation theory. At linear order, the position drift is directly proportional to the transverse velocity on the sky. This linear approximation reproduces our non-linear simulation results to within about 5%. We calculate power spectra for the position drift, splitting the signal into an E- and B-mode and compare the former to linear expectations, finding good agreement. The B-mode is suppressed on linear scales, but has similar amplitude as the E-mode on non-linear scales. We further demonstrate that light-cone inhomogeneities induce biases in the dipole of the drift, introducing redshift dependence of both the amplitude and direction. Although our analysis is not yet sufficient for a firm conclusion, our results suggest that these effects alone cannot explain the possible redshift-dependent dipole in Gaia DR3 data reported in the literature.",

We employ a comprehensive dataset of usual astronomical probes (Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, Hubble data, and Planck 2018 CMB) alongside future mock gravitational wave (GW) distance measurements from the Einstein Telescope. We utilize the Pad'e approximation, a versatile framework encompassing well-known DE models like constant EoS, Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization and other time-evolving DE parametrizations. Within Pad'e parametrization, we examine three specific forms (Pad'e-I, SPad'e-I, Pad'e-II) applied to both spatially flat and non-flat universes. Pad'e-II exhibits particularly interesting features in terms of the evidence of dynamical DE at many standard deviations. Our results can be summarized as follows. Flat Universe: When analyzing the combined dataset of standard probes (including CMB) with Pad'e-II in a flat universe, we find a strong preference (6.4{\\sigma}) for a dynamical (time-varying) DE EoS. This preference remains significant (4.7{\\sigma}) even when incorporating future GW data. Non-Flat Universe: In a non-flat universe, the combined standard datasets (without or with CMB) also indicate dynamical DE EoS at a high confidence level (6.2{\\sigma} and 6.4{\\sigma}, respectively). The addition of GW data slightly reduces the evidence (3.8{\\sigma} and 5.1{\\sigma}, respectively), but the preference persists. These results collectively suggest a robust case for dynamical DE in the dark sector. While a non-flat universe is not strongly favored, Pad'e-II hints at a possible closed universe when CMB data is included (with or without GW data).",

      "abstract": "Mitigating Nonlinear Systematics in Weak Lensing Surveys II: Stability and Diagnostics with Intrinsic Alignment Shiming Gu, Ludovic van Waerbeke, Francis Bernardeau, Sébastien Fabbro 15 pages, 9 plots, comments welcome! Updated to the Phys. Rev. D Accepted version Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The Bernardeau-Nishimichi-Taruya (BNT) transform provides a powerful framework for analysing tomographic cosmic shear data by improving the localization of shear correlations in physical scale. It operates by performing a linear combination of the shear data vector in $\\ell$-space, yielding a transformed vector that is better localized in both redshift and $k$-space. BNT is particularly useful for estimating cosmological parameters while minimizing the impact of poorly understood nonlinear physics, without discarding large amounts of information as is typically done with simple scale cuts. In our previous work, we showed that BNT outperforms traditional weak-lensing analyses; however, that study did not include intrinsic alignments (IA). In the present work, we assess the robustness of our BNT-based $k$-cut framework in the presence of realistic IA models. We consider two cases: (i) when the assumed IA model used in sampling is close to, but not identical to, the true one, and (ii) when the assumed IA model is significantly biased compared to the true one. In the first case, the $k$-cut framework yields precise and unbiased $S_8$ constraints even with limited knowledge of large-scale modes. Using Euclid-like mock data and a stringent $k$-cut of $k \\le 0.1\\;{\\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ for all tomographic bins, we found that BNT can constrain $S_8$ with a precision better than 2\\% while non-BNT has lost all constraining power. In the second case, the BNT transform serves as a powerful diagnostic tool, revealing internal inconsistencies in $k$-space and redshift-space both exceeding 5$\\sigma$ when the functional form of the sampling and fiducial IA models differ fundamentally.",

Zou (DESI Collaboration) 20 pages, 15 figures, submitted to the Open Journal of Astrophysics with updated references Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present a joint cosmological analysis of projected galaxy clustering observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI-DR1), and overlapping weak gravitational lensing observations from three datasets: the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000), the Dark Energy Survey (DES-Y3), and the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Survey (HSC-Y3). This combination of large-scale structure probes allows us to measure a set of $3 \\times 2$-pt correlation functions, breaking the degeneracies between parameters in cosmological fits to individual observables. We obtain mutually-consistent constraints on the parameter $S_8 = \\sigma_8 \\sqrt{\\Omega_{\\rm m}/0.3} = 0.786^{+0.022}_{-0.019}$ from the combination of DESI-DR1 and DES-Y3, $S_8 = 0.760^{+0.020}_{-0.018}$ from KiDS-1000, and $S_8 = 0.771^{+0.026}_{-0.027}$ from HSC-Y3. These parameter determinations are consistent with fits to the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background dataset, albeit with $1.5-2\\sigma$ lower values in the $S_8-\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ plane. We perform our analysis with a unified pipeline tailored to the requirements of each cosmic shear survey, which self-consistently determines cosmological and astrophysical parameters. We generate an analytical covariance matrix for the correlation data including all cross-covariances between probes, and we design a new blinding procedure to safeguard our analysis against confirmation bias, whilst leaving goodness-of-fit statistics unchanged. Our study is part of a suite of papers that present joint cosmological analyses of DESI-DR1 and weak gravitational lensing datasets.",

Weaver, Rongpu Zhou, Hu Zou Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Accurate redshift estimates are a critical requirement for weak lensing surveys and one of the main uncertainties in constraints on dark energy and large-scale cosmic structure. In this paper, we study the potential to calibrate photometric redshift (photo-z) distributions for gravitational lensing using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Since beginning its science operations in 2021, DESI has collected more than 50 million redshifts, adding about one million monthly. In addition to its large-scale structure samples, DESI has also acquired over 256k high-quality spectroscopic redshifts (spec-zs) in the COSMOS and XMM and VVDS fields. This is already a factor of 3 larger than previous spec-z calibration compilations in these two regions. Here, we explore calibrating photo-zs for the subset of KiDS-1000 galaxies that fall into joint self-organizing map (SOM) cells overlapping the DESI COSMOS footprint using the DESI COSMOS observations. Estimating the redshift distribution in KiDS-1000 with the new DESI data, we find broad consistency with previously published results while also detecting differences in the mean redshift in some tomographic bins with an average shifts of Delta Mean(z) = -0.028 in the mean and Delta Median(z) = +0.011 in the median across tomographic bins. However, we also find that incompleteness per SOM cell, i.e., groups of galaxies with similar colors and magnitudes, can modify n(z) distributions. Finally, we comment on the fact that larger photometric catalogs, aligned with the DESI COSMOS and DESI XMM and VVDS footprints, would be needed to fully exploit the DESI dataset and would extend the coverage to nearly eight times the area of existing 9-band photometry.",

      "abstract": "The contribution from small scales on two-point shear analysis: comparison between power spectrum and correlation function João Ferri, Elisa G. M. Ferreira, Ryo Terasawa Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) A known problem in cosmic shear two-point statistics is the apparent inconsistency between analyses performed in harmonic space (power spectrum) and real space (angular correlation). This arises mainly from two factors: first, scale cuts in one space correspond to soft cuts in the other, as the relationship between the two spaces is mediated by Bessel functions. For the same reason, astrophysical effects that are compact in one space may not be in the other, which can lead to biased parameter estimates. In this paper, we argue that these two statistics are complementary: we expect a robust theory to provide consistent constraints regardless of the chosen scale cuts. We present the consequences of pushing our analysis to smaller scales in both spaces, accounting for different models of Intrinsic Alignment and Baryonic Feedback in HSC Y3 data: we find that the harmonic-space analysis is significantly less sensitive to the specific modeling of small-scale physics, with model-choice-driven biases in $S_8$ being 2-3 times smaller than in real space. We show that using a flexible, simulation-based emulator for baryonic feedback (BACCO) in combination with the TATT model for intrinsic alignments provides the most consistent cosmological constraints between the two spaces when pushing to the smallest scales. In contrast, the standard HMCode-2016 model results in a $\\sim 1.1\\sigma$ tension between the two statistics. While harmonic space appears more robust for cosmological inference given current model uncertainties, real-space analyses offer a clearer separation of baryonic effects and will play a crucial role in distinguishing between baryonic feedback models in upcoming surveys.",

Migration through the circumbinary disk will quickly bring stars to the edge of a low-density cavity cleared by the binary, where the stellar orbit becomes trapped and locked with the binary decay. Here we explore the scenario where the trapped stellar orbit decays with the binary until the binary tidally strips the star in a runaway process. For Sun-like stars, this occurs preferentially for $10^4-10^6 M_{\\odot}$ SMBHBs, as the SMBHB enters the LISA band. We estimate that the runaway stripping process will generate Eddington-level X-ray flares repeating on hours-to-days timescales and lasting for decades. The flaring timescales and energetics of these circumbinary-disk tidal-disruption events (CBD-TDEs) match well with the recently discovered Quasi-Periodic Eruptions. However, the inferred rates of the two phenomena are in tension, unless low-mass SMBHB mergers are more common than expected. For less-dense stars, stripping begins earlier in the SMBHB inspiral, has longer repetition times, lasts longer, is dimmer, and can occur for more massive SMBHBs. Whether CBD-TDEs are a known or a yet-undiscovered class of repeating nuclear transients, they could provide a new probe of the elusive SMBH mergers in low mass / dwarf galaxies, which lie in the sweet-spot of the LISA sensitivity.",

      "abstract": "Predicting stellar collision outcomes of main sequence stars Pau Amaro Seoane Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Stellar collisions in dense galactic nuclei might play an important role in fueling supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and shaping their environments. The gas released during these collisions can contribute to SMBH accretion, influencing phenomena such as active galactic nuclei and tidal disruption events of the remnants. We address the challenge of rapidly and accurately predicting the outcomes of stellar collisionsincluding remnant masses and unbound gasacross a broad parameter space of initial conditions. Existing smoothed-particle-hydrodynamic (SPH) simulation techniques, while detailed, are too resource-intensive for exploratory studies or real-time applications. We develop a machine learning framework trained on a dataset of $\\sim 16,000$ SPH simulations of main-sequence star collisions. By extracting physically meaningful parameters (e.g., masses, radii, impact parameters, and virial ratios) and employing gradient-boosted regression trees with Huber loss, we create a model that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. The method includes logarithmic transforms to handle dynamic ranges and regularization to ensure physical plausibility. The model achieves predictions of collision outcomes (remnant masses, and unbound mass) with very low mean absolute errors respect to the typical mass scale. It operates in fractions of a second, enabling large-scale parameter studies and real-time applications. Parameter importance analysis reveals that the impact parameter and the relative velocity dominate outcomes, aligning with theoretical expectations. Our approach provides a scalable tool for studying stellar collisions in galactic nuclei. The rapid predictions facilitate investigations into gas supply for SMBH accretion and the cumulative effects of collisions over cosmic time, particularly relevant to address the growth of SMBHs.",

A&A submitted Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Gravitationally lensed quasars are viable cosmic tools for constraining a diversity of fundamental astrophysical phenomena; They enable identification of faint, low-mass supermassive black holes, provide unique constraints on the intervening intergalactic or interstellar medium in their sightlines, and can be used to determine key cosmological quantities such as the Hubble constant, $H_0$. However, they are rare phenomena, and it has proven difficult to define efficient, unbiased selection methods.} In this study, we report the independent spectroscopic identification of a remarkable triple-lensed quasar at $z=2.67$, identified based on astrometric measurements from the {\\em Gaia} mission, previously identified in Pan-STARRS. Furthermore, a larger spectroscopic follow-up survey of {\\em Gaia}-detected candidate lensed quasars. We characterize in detail the three mirror images of the quasar and their spatial and temporal spectroscopic coverage, with focus on the emission-line properties which shows variation across sigthlines and temporal evolution over the $\\sim 11$months spectroscopic campaign. We construct a lens model of the foreground source from a combination of the multiple spectra and deep optical imaging, providing a robust halo mass of $M_{\\rm h} = (2.78 \\pm 0.05)\\times 10^{10}M_\\odot$. Based on the lens model, the time delay between each sightline is translated into an intrinsic quasar time, allowing us to construct a quasar timeseries over $\\sim18$months with monthly cadence. Over months timescales the broad emission lines vary in both velocity offset and equivalent width (EW) as well as an overall increase in ionization. This exemplary triple-lensed quasars demonstrates the viability of identifying such rare lens configurations based purely on the astrometric measurements from the {\\em Gaia} mission, which we here provide optimized selection criteria for, for future studies.",

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy of GLIMPSE-16043, a promising $z\\sim6$ Pop III candidate originally identified through NIRCam photometry as having weak [OIII]$\\lambda\\lambda4959,5007$ emission. Our follow-up reveals clear [OIII] emission, ruling out a genuine zero-metallicity nature. However, the combination of the measured line fluxes and photometry indicates that its spectral energy distribution requires an extraordinarily strong Balmer jump ($-1.66 \\pm 0.47$ mag) and H$\\alpha$ equivalent width ($3750\\pm1800$ Å), features that cannot be reproduced by current stellar+nebular or pure nebular photoionization models. The only models approaching the observations to almost within $1\\sigma$ involve a hot ($T_{\\rm eff}\\!\\simeq\\!10^{4.7}$ K) single blackbody embedded in a low-$T_{\\rm e}$ nebular environment, suggestive of scenarios such as a tidal-disruption event or a microquasar with strong disk winds. This cautions that photometric Pop~III selections are vulnerable to contamination when the rest-frame optical continuum is undetected. Motivated by this, we refine the photometric Pop III selection criteria to exclude the locus of extreme Balmer-jump objects. The revised criteria also recover the recently reported spectroscopic candidate AMORE6, demonstrating that the updated selection preserves sensitivity to genuine Pop III-like sources while removing key contaminants. Applying the refined criteria across legacy survey fields and five newly released CANUCS lensing cluster fields, we revisit the Pop III UV luminosity function and estimate the Pop III cosmic star-formation rate density to be $\\approx[10^{-6}$--$10^{-4}]$~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$~cMpc$^{-3}$ at $z\\simeq6$--7, falling in the range of current theoretical predictions.",

      "abstract": "Diffusive or Ballistic? Distributions and Spectra of PeV Cosmic Rays around Microquasars Yutaka Fujita, Rohta Takahashi, Norita Kawanaka High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) In the standard Galactic cosmic-ray (CR) paradigm, protons are accelerated up to ~1 PeV by Galactic sources. While supernova remnants (SNRs) have been traditionally considered as the primary accelerators, recent observations by LHAASO and HAWC have detected very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays exceeding 100 TeV from several microquasars, suggesting that these X-ray binaries can accelerate CRs beyond 1 PeV. We investigate the escape process of CRs from microquasars, focusing on the energy-dependent transport mechanisms. High-energy CRs are likely to have long mean free paths and move ballistically on scales smaller than their mean free path, while lower-energy CRs undergo diffusive propagation. This transition results in a spectral break in the CR distribution around the microquasar. We calculate CR energy spectra within a 10-30 pc radius for various diffusion coefficients and timescales. Our model predicts a spectral break and hardening at E_p ~10-100 TeV when the standard diffusion coefficient for the interstellar space is assumed. However, current VHE gamma-ray observations do not show clear spectral breaks, suggesting that the diffusion coefficient may be significantly reduced near microquasars, possibly due to magnetic field amplification by CR-driven turbulence.",

Townsend 11 pages, 6 figures, submitted to ApJL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The JWST discovery of \"Little Red Dots\" (LRDs) has revealed a population of compact, red sources at $z \\sim 5-10$ that likely host supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Recent observations of the gravitationally lensed LRD R2211-RX1 reveal century-scale photometric variability and a hysteresis loop in the luminosity-temperature plane, strongly suggesting that the optical emission originates from a pulsating, stellar-like photosphere rather than an accretion disk. This supports the \"quasi-star\" hypothesis, where a rapidly growing black hole seed is embedded within a massive, radiation-pressure supported envelope. In this work, we investigate the stability of these envelopes using the stellar evolution code MESA coupled with the non-adiabatic oscillation code GYRE. We identify a theoretical \"Quasi-Star Instability Strip\" with a blue edge at $T_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 5000-5200$ K. Models hotter than this threshold are stable, consistent with the non-variable LRD R2211-RX2 ($T_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 5000$ K), while cooler models are unstable to radial pulsations driven by the $\\kappa$-mechanism in helium and hydrogen ionization zones. For quasi-star masses in the range $M_\\star \\sim 10^4-10^5 M_\\odot$, we find that the unstable fundamental radial modes ($\\ell =0$, n$_{\\rm p}=1$) have periods in the range $\\sim 20-180$ years. The first overtone ($\\ell =0$, n$_{\\rm p}=2$) is also unstable or marginally stable in some of our models, with typical pulsation timescales $\\sim 10-30$ years. These oscillations match the co-moving frame variability timescale of RX1. We argue that these violent pulsations likely drive enhanced mass loss analogous to super-AGB winds, which could affect the duration of the quasi-star phase and regulate the final mass of the seeded black hole.",

The method is based on constructing constrained Brownian bridges, whose correlation properties can be tuned at will allowing flexibility between a conservative prior and a theory-informed prior.

Tevzadze High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) In this Letter, we show that magnetized relativistic outflows can exhibit a relativistic effect in which Lorentz transformation maps magnetic field topology into apparent temporal variability in the observer's frame. Using a force-free Beltrami configurations as representative equilibria of magnetically dominated outflows, we demonstrate that Lorentz mapping of stationary helical magnetic field produces quasi-periodic modulation of observable electromagnetic signatures, without invoking intrinsic plasma variability. This effect may be described as an aberration of force-free magnetic fields under Lorentz transformation. The characteristic frequency of the time variability is determined by the helical wave-number of the magnetic field, the viewing angle, and the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet outflow, and scales linearly with $\\Gamma$. This establishes a purely kinematic relativistic origin of variability and introduces the concept of magnetic Lorentz seismology: the inference of magnetic field structure in relativistic outflows directly from observed temporal variability.",

In this Letter, we report observations of medium-scale anisotropies (MSA) at energies above 10 TeV using the LHAASO-KM2A array. Our analysis identifies four regions of excess and four regions of deficit, each spanning angular scales of approximately ten degrees. Crucially, we detect significant energy-dependent shifts in the centroids of two excess regions: Region B and the newly identified Region $\\mathrm{\\widetilde{D}}$. We also characterize the energy evolution of the fractional relative intensity across both excess and deficit regions. These findings imply that the observed anisotropies are shaped by the specific realization of the local turbulent magnetic field within the cosmic ray scattering length. Such energy-dependent behaviors impose strict constraints on local turbulence models and cosmic ray propagation theories.",

Early alerts favored a neutron-star-containing merger, making this a compelling target. Motivated by theoretical predictions of coherent radio bursts from mergers involving a neutron star, we utilized the OVRO-LWA Time Machine system to analyze voltage data recorded around the time of the event. The Time Machine is a two-stage voltage buffer and processing pipeline that continuously buffers raw data from all antennas across the array's nearly full-hemisphere instantaneous field of view, enabling retrospective beamforming, dedispersion, and fast-transient candidate identification. For this event, we analyzed a 30-minute interval beginning 3.5 minutes after the merger, which included two minutes of pre-alert data recovered by the ring buffer. We searched the 50% localization probability region with millisecond time resolution in the 69-86 MHz frequency band. No radio counterpart was detected above a 7-sigma fluence detection threshold of ~150 Jy ms. Using Bayesian analysis, we place a 95% confidence upper limit on the source luminosity of L95 = 4 x 10^41 erg s^-1. These constraints start to probe the bright end of the coherent-emission parameter space predicted by jet-ISM shock processes, magnetar and blitzar-like mechanisms, and recent simulation-based scenarios for neutron-star-containing mergers. This study presents the first sensitive, large-area, millisecond-timescale search for prompt low-frequency radio emission from a GW merger with the OVRO-LWA, establishing a framework in which about ten additional events will yield stringent population-level constraints.",

Meanwhile, the LHAASO collaboration published the measurement of an orbitally modulated photon flux from Cygnus~X-3 extending up to 4 PeV. These observations point towards CR acceleration in the jet, and secondary production in CRs scattering on gas from the wind and on stellar UV photons from the companion star.

Using surrogates to determine the significance of our findings, we conclude that Mkn 421 exhibits more determinism than PKS 1424-41, and that both sources potentially show nonlinearity. However, the latter has to be tested against more advanced surrogates that are able to replicate the nonstationarity of the original light curves. In future work, we will extend our recurrence analysis to a sample of $\\sim50$ $\\gamma$-ray bright sources to probe the jet dynamics of different blazar classes.",

Liu 8 pages, 5 figures; Accepted for publication in MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We investigate the accretion geometry in neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in the hard spectral state. It is commonly accepted that, for low mass transfer rates, an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) is present in the inner region. But the observed relativistically broadened emission lines in the reflection spectra clearly indicate the existence of discs near the innermost stable circular orbit $(R_{\\rm{ISCO}})$. We investigate the interaction between the coronal flow and the disc in neutron star LMXBs, and find that gas condensation from the dominant, coronal accretion flow to an inner disc is enhanced as compared to that in black hole LMXBs as a consequence of irradiation of the corona by the neutron star surface. Computations show that for low mass transfer rates ($\\sim 0.005-0.02$ Eddington rate) a persistent weak disc can coexist with a coronal flow in the innermost region, where a pure ADAF would have been expected. The inner disc extends outwards from $R_{\\rm{ISCO}}$ to $\\sim 10 R_{\\rm{ISCO}}$ for Eddington ratios ($L/L_{\\rm{Edd}}$) as low as $\\sim 0.002$, covers a larger region for higher Eddington ratios, and eventually connects to the outer disc at $L/L_{\\rm{Edd}} \\sim 0.02$, thereby transiting to a soft state. We demonstrate that the observationally inferred region of the broad iron lines in the hard-state sources generally lies within the extension of the inner discs predicted by the condensation model. Disappearance of the broad iron lines is predicted at very low luminosities, either caused by very low accretion rates or disc truncation by strong magnetic fields.",

The frequency-dependent circular polarization of single pulses, with high signal-to-noise ratios, is recorded by the FAST, which shows great diversity, and we are trying an effort to understand such circular polarization based on the wave mode coupling in the limiting polarization region, and consequently to constrain the dynamical parameters. By quantitatively comparing models with data using Bayesian analysis, it is found that the plasma multiplicity is approximately between $10^0$ and $10^{2}$, while the Lorentz factor of the particles between $10^{0.5}$ and $10^{2}$.

To reproduce the abundances ratios in the VMP stars, the explosive nucleosynthesis should take place under the neutrino exposure, which is time integration of neutrino flux, of $\\sigma_\\nu\\sim 10^{35}\\,\\mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}}$ and temperature of $2.0\\,\\mathrm{GK}\\leq T \\leq 3.2\\,\\mathrm{GK}$. The dependence on the density and each value of the neutrino flux and the duration of nucleosynthesis is weak. We also discuss whether the quantitative requirements are realized during the explosion. Although the requirements are difficult to be realized in the one-dimensional simulations, the non-monotonic thermal evolution shown in recent three-dimensional simulations may satisfy them. Because the evolution is likely caused by turbulent motion stemming from the initial asphericity of the progenitor, it is important to calculate the long-term three-dimensional supernova explosion of multi-dimensional metal-free progenitor models and follow the nucleosynthesis self-consistently.",

In this respect, particularly interesting are the sources whose synchrotron emission covers a broad range of frequencies, from radio to X-rays, such as the BL Lac objects of the HSP type. Previous measurements including radio, optical and X-ray data show a clear trend, with the degree of polarization increasing with frequency. Here we report radio, optical and X-ray observations ($Swift$, $Nustar$ and $IXPE$) of 1ES 1101-232 and RGB J0710+591, two blazars belonging to the puzzling subclass of extreme BL Lacs (EHBL). For 1ES 1101-232 we found a strong frequency-dependency of the degree of polarization (with a ratio $\\Pi_X/\\Pi_O\\simeq 5.2$). For RGB J0710+591, IXPE derived a 1$\\sigma$ upper limit $\\Pi_X<11.6\\%$, comparable with the measured optical degree of polarization (average $\\Pi_O\\sim 12\\%$). We discuss the results in the framework of current interpretations and, in particular, we report an improved version of the stratified shock model that is able to reproduce the observed data of both sources.",

By calibrating the onset times of the outbursts, we identify three distinct classes for the FRED-type events: (i) the long-high outbursts, exceeding ~50 d in duration with peak count rates above ~40 cnt/s; (ii) the short-medium outbursts, with durations of ~20 d and peak count rates of ~30-50 cnt/s; and (iii) the short-low outbursts, also lasting ~20 d but reaching only ~20-30 cnt/s at peak. We, furthermore, examine the relation between pre-outburst duration and the peak & integrated count rates of the upcoming outburst.

Accepted by Astronomy and Astrophysics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present a multi-wavelength study of the symbiotic recurrent nova (RN) T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) using Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) / X-Ray Telescope (XRT) / UltraViolet Optical Telescope (UVOT) and American Association of Variable Stars Observers (AAVSO) observations from 2005 to 2025. Our analysis spans quiescent, high, and pre-eruption dip states. We find that brightening amplitudes increase toward shorter wavelengths in both optical and UV bands, while the UV and X-ray fluxes are generally anti-correlated throughout all phases. During the 2023-2024 pre-eruption dip, soft and hard X-rays increased as optical and ultraviolet (UV) brightness declined, consistent with a transition from an optically thick to thin boundary layer driven by a reduction in the accretion rate. We also report, for the first time, a second, lower-amplitude dip occurring between September 2024 and February 2025 following the primary 2023-2024 pre-eruption dip. The observed variability supports an accretion-variation scenario as a unifying explanation for both the high and dip states, and may signal an imminent nova eruption.",

Manual identification of QMP in large-scale pulsar single-pulse datasets remains highly inefficient. To address this, we propose a Dual-Stage Residual Network (DSR) that achieves automated QMP detection in FAST observational data through joint analysis of single-pulse profiles and their Amplitude Distribution Profiles (ADP), defined as the power spectra of the autocorrelation function derivatives of the microstructure residuals. The model was trained on PSR B1933+16 data from 2019 (10,486 single pulses) and evaluated on manually annotated PSR B1933+16 data from 2020 (9,657 single pulses). DSR achieved 96.10\\% recall and 95.85\\% precision on the test set. This approach provides an automated pipeline for large-scale, reproducible QMP identification and establishes the foundation for in-depth investigation of their physical mechanisms.",

Their relativistic jets, closely aligned to the line of sight from Earth, are a rich and complex environment, characterised by the presence of strong magnetic fields over parsec-scale lengths. Owing to their cosmological distance from Earth, these sources serve as ideal targets to probe non-standard gamma-ray propagation. In particular, axion-like particles (ALPs) could be detected through their coupling to photons, which enables ALP-photon conversions in external magnetic fields, leading to distinct signatures in the blazars' gamma-ray spectra. In this work, we explore a novel approach to constrain the ALP parameter space using gamma-ray observations, based on the use of machine-learning classifiers. We apply this technique to simulated observations of two bright blazars -- Mrk 501 and PKS 2155$-$304 -- with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), a next-generation gamma-ray facility well suited to probe such features, thanks to its improved energy resolution and point-source sensitivity with respect to present ground-based gamma-ray telescopes. The obtained $2\\sigma$ exclusion regions on the ALP parameter space are consistent with those found by applying a standard likelihood-ratio test, and suggest that the CTAO sensitivity to ALPs could be extended beyond existing constraints over a wide mass range.",

Nearby massive stars in the late stages of stellar evolution provide a promising environment for enhanced ALP production due to their high core temperatures and densities. We search for a combined signal of ALP-induced hard X-ray and soft $\\gamma$-ray emission from 18 nearby pre-supernova stars using the full public 22-year INTEGRAL/SPI dataset, construct individual stellar spectra and link them in a coherent analysis. A maximum-likelihood approach is used to extract fluxes in the 20--2000 keV energy range. Stellar evolution models are employed to obtain the expected spectral shapes of ALP production processes peaking between 50--500 keV, depending on stellar mass and evolutionary stage. We construct a joint likelihood that incorporates uncertainties in stellar parameters to derive combined constraints on the coupling constants $g_{a\\gamma}$ and $g_{ae}$ as a function of the ALP mass $m_a$. The hard X-ray and soft $\\gamma$-ray fluxes of all selected stars are consistent with zero within uncertainties. We provide upper limits on the continuum emission and on the 511 keV and 1809 keV line fluxes. The combined upper limit on $g_{a\\gamma} \\times g_{ae}$ is $(0.008 - 2) x 10^{-24}$ GeV$^{-1}$ (95% C.I.) while the ALP-photon coupling is constrained to $g_{a\\gamma} = (0.13 - 1.26) x 10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ (95% C.I.) for $m_a\\leqq10^{-11}$ eV, depending on the time to core collapse and magnetic field assumptions. Conservative limits of $(0.27 - 1.25) x 10^{-24}$ GeV$^{-1}$ (95% C.I.) are obtained assuming all but one star are in the early He-burning phase. These results rank among the strongest limits on ALP couplings to date and demonstrate the importance of soft $\\gamma$-ray observations for probing ALPs and massive star evolution.",

Coughlin High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are expected to produce intense bursts of neutrinos preceding the emergence of their electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. The prompt detection of such neutrino signals offers a unique opportunity to trigger early follow-up observations in the EM domain. We aim to assess the feasibility and efficiency of an optical-NIR follow-up strategy for CCSNe discovered via neutrino bursts, by modelling the spatial distribution of events and simulating realistic observational campaigns taking into account the size of the localization error box generated by triangulating the neutrino burst. We modelled the Galactic distribution of CCSNe, including the effects of interstellar extinction, and considered three main progenitor types: Wolf-Rayet stars, red and blue supergiants. We included the shock breakout in the EM signatures that could be detected following the neutrino burst. A population of CCSNe was generated and detected by different networks of neutrino observatories, including IceCube, KM3NeT, Super-Kamiokande, Hyper-Kamiokande, and JUNO. The resulting skymaps were used as input for GWEMOPT to produce optimized follow-up plans with two optical facilities: LSST and the TAROT robotic telescopes. Both LSST and TAROT exhibit comparable detection efficiencies for the simulated CCSN population. However, the TAROT network achieves similar success rates while requiring fewer pointings to cover the CCSN skymap. Our simulations demonstrate that neutrino follow-up campaigns can effectively CCSN optical counterparts using both large and small facilities. Depending on the neutrino network, the median number of pointings for the two tested optical facilities is of the order of 20 to 100 to find the EM emission. The number of images is larger for LSST than for TAROT by a factor of 2 to 4.",

Machine learning (ML) is an emerging tool that is useful in drawing valuable science out of incomprehensibly large datasets, identifying complex trends in data that are otherwise overlooked. Moreover, ML can potentially enhance the quality and quantity of scientific data as it is collected. This paper explores how a new ML method can improve the rate of classification of rare Ic-BL supernovae (SNe). New parameters called magnitude rates were introduced to train ML models to identify SNe Ic-BL in large datasets. The same methodology was applied to a population of SN Ia transients to see if the methodology could be reproducible with another SN class. Three magnitudes, three time differences, two magnitude rates and the second derivative of these rates were calculated using the first three available photometric data points in a single filter. Initial investigations show that the Random Forest algorithm provides a strong foundation for the early classifications SNe Ic-BL and SNe Ia. Testing this model again on an unseen dataset shows that the model can identify upward of 13% of the total true SN Ic-BL population, significantly improving upon current methods. By implementing a dedicated observation campaign using this model, the number of SN Ic-BL classified and the quality of early-time data collected each year will see considerable growth in the near future.",

The absence of TeV gamma-rays from NGC~1068 indicates neutrino production in compact gamma-ray-opaque region. The vicinity of the supermassive black hole, such as disk-corona, is an ideal region, where the high radiation density leads to efficient neutrino production as well as the gamma-ray attenuation. Disk-corona models predict that the neutrino emission from AGNs correlates with X-ray emission, which traces the coronal activity. In this paper, we assess whether the X-ray AGN population origin for TeV neutrinos can be tested by using the spatial correlation between the neutrino population and X-ray AGN population with future neutrino telescopes. By performing simulations, we find that, the AGN origin of the neutrino background above 100\\,TeV can be tested at a confidence level of $\\sim2.4\\sigma$ with five-year observations of IceCube-Gen2, which has an angular resolution of $\\sim0.2$ degree.

Permitting explicit first-order phase transitions allows us to systematically search for twin-star solutions, i.e. the existence of stars degenerate in mass but differing in radius. We find that current observational constraints exclude all but two classes of twin stars. The first is characterized by a first-order transition occurring at a very low density, where the material properties of the system either stay largely intact or move away from the conformal limit. In the second, more interesting class, the discontinuity in the mass-radius curve emerges after a rapid crossover transition at a significantly higher density, with the speed of sound exhibiting two sharp peaks at distinct densities. Since neither class shows clear conformalization upon entering the second branch, the standard twin-star scenario linking the mass-radius discontinuity to deconfinement can be firmly ruled out, while even the remaining solutions -- disfavored by per-mille Bayes factors and in tension with theoretical bounds -- are likely to be excluded in the future.",

In this letter, we propose a new formation scenario for black hole (BH) + Be star binaries (hereafter BHBe binaries), where the Be star is produced through the Wind Roche Lobe Overflow (WRLOF) mechanism. Our analysis is based on numerical simulations of the WRLOF process in massive binaries, building upon recent theoretical work. We demonstrate that the WRLOF model can efficiently form BHBe binaries under reasonable assumptions on stellar wind velocities. Using rapid binary population synthesis, we estimate the population of such systems in the Milky Way, predicting approximately $\\sim$ {1800-3200} currently existing BHBe binaries originating from the WRLOF channel. These systems are characterized by high eccentricities and exceptionally wide orbits, with typical orbital periods exceeding 1000 days and a peak distribution around $\\sim$10000 days. Due to their long orbital separations, these BHBe binaries are promising targets for future detection via astrometric {and interferometric} observations.",

      "abstract": "Height and Energy Evolution of X-ray Double Sources in a Solar Flare Hanya Pan, Astrid M. Veronig, Rui Liu Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) In the standard model, magnetic reconnection at a vertical current sheet above the flare arcade is key to explaining many aspects of solar eruptions. The supra-arcade region is where the vertical current sheet is supposedly located, and X-ray/EUV emission therein reflects underlying energy release and transport processes, therefore providing valuable insight into the structure and evolution of the current sheet. Previous studies have focused primarily on the impulsive phase of flares, but phenomena in the decay phase are also crucial for understanding the complete flaring scenario. In this paper, we investigated an M6.7-class limb flare that occurred on August 28, 2022, combining observations from the Solar Orbiter (SolO) and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Coronal X-ray sources are continually observed by the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) onboard SolO for over two hours, revealing a multi-phase evolution with varying velocities and multiple substructures, with higher-energy components consistently appearing at higher altitudes. Such a height-energy relation is notably observed in a double coronal source during the decay-phase, which is dominated by thermal emission. The energy distribution of the double source distinguish itself from previous studies that showed a symmetric distribution, with the higher-energy components being closer to the center of the double source during the impulsive phase. Obtained from two opposite side-on perspectives on the supra-arcade region, these findings reveal the spatio-temporal complexity of the energy release process in the post-flare current sheet during the decay phase.",

Comments welcome Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Searching for fleeting radio transients like fast radio bursts (FRBs) with wide-field radio telescopes has become a common challenge in data-intensive science. Conventional algorithms normally cost enormous time to seek candidates by finding the correct dispersion measures, of which the process is so-called dedispersion. Here we present a novel scheme to identify FRB signals from raw data without dedispersion using Machine Learning (ML). Under the data environment for multibeam receivers, we train the EfficientNet model and achieve both exceeding 92% accuracy and precision in FRB recognition. We find that the searching efficiency can be significantly enhanced without the procedure of dedispersion compared with conventional softwares like TransientX and presto. Specifically, the impact of radio frequency interference (RFI) for single-beam and multibeam data has been investigated, and we find ML can naturally mitigate RFI under the multibeam environment. Finally, we validate the trained model on actual data from the current FRB surveys carried out by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, which provides considerable potential for real implementation in the future.",

Published in MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) AT2022rze is a luminous, ambiguous transient located South-East of the geometric center of its host galaxy at redshift z = 0.08. The host appears to be formed by a merging galaxy system. The observed characteristics of AT2022rze are reminiscent of active galactic nuclei (AGN), tidal disruption events (TDEs), and superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). The transient reached a peak absolute magnitude of -20.2 +- 0.2 mag, showing a sharp rise (trise,1/e = 27.5 +- 0.6 days) followed by a slow decline (tdec,1/e = 382.9 +- 0.6). Its bumpy light curve and narrow Balmer lines indicate the presence of gas (and dust). Its light curve shows rather red colors, indicating that the transient could be affected by significant host extinction. The spectra reveal coronal lines, indicative of high-energy (X-ray/UV) emission. Archival data reveal no prior activity at this location, disfavoring a steady-state AGN, although an optical spectrum obtained prior to the transient is consistent with an AGN classification of the host. Based on this, we conclude that the transient most likely represents a Changing-look AGN at the center of the smallest component of the merging system.",

Our analysis reveals energy thresholds beyond which LIV, within a kinematic framework, significantly alters particle dynamics and photon spectra, introducing non-physical divergences that highlight limitations in perturbative approaches. We model synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission in the presence of LIV and assess its consequences for photon fluxes from blazars, including Markarian 501 and the BL Lac population. LIV introduces distinct high-energy emission regions that deviate from standard expectations. Comparisons with observational data, particularly upper limits from the Pierre Auger Observatory, suggest that future multi-messenger observations, together with the full analysis of particle's trajectories, could constrain LIV parameters through the non-detection of such excesses.",

It has been recently proposed that such layers, arising during flux eruption events, can power the rapid TeV flares observed from the core of M87. In this scenario, inverse Compton scattering of soft radiation from the accretion flow by energetic electron-positron pairs produced near the reconnection layer was suggested as the primary emission mechanism. However, detailed calculations show that radiation from pairs alone cannot account for the GeV emission detected by the Fermi observatory. In this work, we combine analytic estimates with 3D radiative particle-in-cell simulations of pair-proton plasmas to show that the GeV emission can be naturally explained by synchrotron radiation from protons accelerated in the current sheet. Although the exact proton content of the layer is uncertain, our model remains robust across a broad range of proton-to-pair number density ratios. While protons are subdominant in number compared to pairs, our simulations demonstrate that they can be accelerated more efficiently, leading to a self-regulated steady state in which protons dominate the energy budget. Ultimately, proton synchrotron emission accounts for approximately 5%-20% of the total dissipation power. The majority is radiated as MeV photons via pair synchrotron emission, with a smaller fraction emitted as TeV photons through inverse Compton scattering.",

In this work, we analyze a sample of 163 long-duration GRBs detected by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE), applying detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to derive the Hurst index as a quantitative descriptor of temporal correlations in the light curves. We further explore statistical correlations between the Hurst index and 12 other observational parameters through regression and correlation analyses. Our results reveal anti-correlations between the Hurst index and the burst durations (T50, T90), and a negative trend with the low-energy spectral index \\alpha. We also find that correlations with peak photon flux are strongest at the shorter timescale (64 ms) and systematically weaken at longer timescales (256-1024 ms), indicating that the persistence of temporal correlations is most evident in the rapid variability component of GRB emission. The results offer new perspectives on the temporal structure of the GRB emission and its potential link to the underlying physical mechanisms driving these bursts.",

Perets, Jonathan Granot High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (ULGRBs), a rare class of high-energy transients with durations $>10^3$s, remain poorly understood. GRB 250702B is notable for its multi-hour prompt emission, an X-ray pre-peak emission starting $\\sim$1 day earlier, off-nuclear host position, and hard, rapidly variable gamma-rays. This combination is difficult to explain with standard ULGRB progenitors such as blue-supergiant collapsars, magnetar engines, or white-dwarf tidal disruptions by intermediate-mass black holes. We interpret the event as a micro-tidal disruption event ($\\mu$TDE), where a stellar-mass black hole or neutron star partially or fully disrupts a main-sequence star. Three $\\mu$TDE pathways can reproduce the observed pre-peak emission to main flare delay: (i) a dynamical (partial/repeating) disruption, in which a grazing passage yields a faint precursor and the core returns after $\\sim$day for a deeper encounter; (ii) a natal-kick disruption, where the delay reflects the ballistic motion of a newborn compact object relative to its companion, leading to full disruption; and (iii) a hybrid natal-kick + partial case, in which the kick seeds the close encounter but the first passage is only partial, with the core returning on the day-scale period. Cross-section scalings imply comparable rates for partial and full outcomes in both dynamical and natal-kick scenarios. The highly variable, hard $\\gamma$-ray emission supports association with a stellar-mass compact object. Fallback and viscous accretion naturally explain the ultra-long duration, energetics, and ks-scale X-ray variability. We outline observational discriminants between the three channels and argue that $\\mu$TDEs offer a compelling framework for ULGRBs such as GRB 250702B.",

Title changed High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Very Faint X-ray Transients (VFXTs) are a class of X-ray binary systems that exhibit occasional outbursts with peak X-ray luminosities (L_X< 1e36 erg s^-1) much lower than typical X-ray transients. On 22nd February 2024, during its daily Galactic center monitoring, Swift-XRT detected a VFXT, 7 arcmin from Sgr A* dubbing it Swift J174610--290018. We aim to characterize the outburst that occurred in 2024, and a second, distinct outburst in 2025, to understand the nature and accretion flow properties of this new VFXT. Swift-XRT light curves are used to constrain the duration of the two events. We carried out X-ray spectral analysis exploiting XMM and NuSTAR data. We used Chandra and XMM observations of the last 25 years to constrain the quiescent luminosity of the source. During the 2024 outburst, which lasted about 50 days, the source reached a luminosity in the 2-10 keV band of L_X = 1.2e35 erg s^-1 (assuming it is located at the Galactic center). The 2025 outburst is shorter (about 5 days), and reached L_X = 9e34 erg s^-1. The spectral features of the source include an excess at 6.5-7 keV, which can be associated either with a single reflection line or with the ionized Fe XXV and XXVI lines. The same source was identified in both the XMM and Chandra catalogs of point sources (known as 4XMM J174610.7--290020). During previous detections, the source displayed luminosity levels ranging from L_X= 2e32 to L_X = 3e34 erg s^-1 between 2000 and 2010. Moreover, it exhibited a potential type I X-ray burst in 2004. The analysis of the outbursts and the potential type I burst strongly suggests the neutron star low mass X-ray binary (NS-LMXB) nature of the VFXT. The source can be described by an accretion disk corona (as has been recently proposed by the XRISM/Xtend analysis). This scenario explains the overall low luminosity of this transient and the peculiar iron lines in the spectrum.",

These trends challenge simple single-zone synchrotron models and suggest a more intricate, turbulent jet structure with multiple emission zones. We develop a statistical framework to model the observed energy-dependent polarization patterns in blazars, focusing on the behavior captured by IXPE in the X-ray band and RoboPol in the optical. The goal is to statistically characterize multi-zone models in terms of the distributions of cell size and the physical parameters of the electron energy distribution (EED). A Monte Carlo approach, implemented with the JetSeT code, is used to generate synthetic multi-zone synchrotron emission from a spherical region filled with turbulent cells with randomly distributed physical properties. Simulations explore scenarios ranging from identical cells to power-law distributions of cell sizes and EED parameters with variable cutoff and low-energy slopes. The results show that a purely turbulent, multi-zone model can reproduce the observed energy-dependent polarization without requiring correlations between cell size and EED parameters. The polarization degree is primarily determined by the effective, flux-weighted, number of emitting cells, modulated by the dispersion in cell properties, particularly the EED cutoff energy at high frequencies and the low-energy spectral index at low frequencies. With a fractional dispersion in cutoff energy of about 90% and a low-energy spectral index dispersion of ~0.5-1.5, the model reproduces the chromatic mm-to-X-ray polarization trends seen by IXPE and the optical polarization limiting envelope observed in the RoboPol dataset.",

Accepted for publication in a special issue of OJA on pulsar science with the SKAO High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The known population of non-accreting neutron stars is ever growing and currently consists of more than 3500 sources. Pulsar surveys with the SKAO telescopes will greatly increase the known population, adding radio pulsars to every subgroup in the radio-loud neutron star family. These discoveries will not only add to the current understanding of neutron star physics by increasing the sample of sources that can be studied, but will undoubtedly also uncover previously unknown types of sources that will challenge our theories of a wide range of physical phenomena. A broad variety of scientific studies will be made possible by a significantly increased known population of neutron stars, unravelling questions such as: How do isolated pulsars evolve with time; What is the connection between magnetars, high B-field pulsars, and the newly discovered long-period pulsars; How is a pulsar's spin-down related to its radio emission; What is the nuclear equation of state? Increasing the known numbers of pulsars in binary or triple systems may enable both larger numbers and higher precision tests of gravitational theories and general relativity, as well as probing the neutron star mass distribution. The excellent sensitivity of the SKAO telescopes combined with the wide field of view, large numbers of simultaneous tied-array beams that will be searched in real time, wide range of observing frequencies, and the ability to form multiple sub-arrays will make the SKAO an excellent facility to undertake a wide range of neutron star research. In this paper, we give an overview of different types of neutron stars and discuss how the SKAO telescopes will aid in our understanding of the neutron star population.",

As a potential probe of the old stellar population, in particular CVs, the existence and detectability of novae in the GC remain elusive, due to the prohibitive extinction toward the GC and their relatively low occurrence rate. Nova remnants evolving in the characteristic hot ($T\\sim{10^{6}~\\rm K}$) and dense ($n_e\\sim{10~\\rm cm^{-3}}$) interstellar medium in the GC may shed light on recent novae and provide useful insight on the GC ecosystem. In this work, we perform hydrodynamical simulations of putative nova remnants in the GC environment and calculate their time-dependent multiwavelength emission to estimate the detectability. Among 79 models sampling the nova parameter space (primarily ejecta mass and velocity), 6, 44, and 51 modelled nova remnants are detectable at their X-ray, radio, and Paschen-$\\alpha$ maximum, respectively, for existing Chandra, VLA, and HST observations of the GC. The predicted peak luminosities are $\\sim10^{32}~\\rm erg~s^{-1}$, $\\sim10^{31}~\\rm erg~s^{-1}$, and $\\sim10^{36}~\\rm erg~s^{-1}$ in these three bands and the detectable window ranges from weeks to notably hundred years. By specifying a CV population of the nuclear star cluster, we estimate the probability of detecting at least one remnant to be 20%, 8%, and 18% in X-rays, radio, and Pa$\\alpha$. The nova remnant would be best resolved in the X-ray band. Our study highlights the potential for detecting nova remnants through further observations, leveraging JWST and the potentially forthcoming AXIS and SKA.",

Stefani 15 pages, 15 figures, 2 Tables, accepted for publication in Physical Review Fluids Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The effects of axial boundaries, or endcaps are of fundamental interest in many Taylor-Couette (TC) flow experiments. A main challenge in those experiments has been to minimize these effects, which can substantially alter the flow structure compared to the axially unbounded idealized case. Therefore, understanding and disentangling the influence of endcaps on the TC flow dynamics is essential for the unambiguous interpretation of experimental results, particularly when other dynamical processes (instabilities) in TC flows are involved. In this paper, we study the hydrodynamic evolution of a quasi-Keplerian TC flow in the presence of split endcaps for high Reynolds numbers, $Re$, up to $2\\times 10^5$, which are larger than those considered in related previous studies. At these $Re$, the flow deviates from the ideal TC flow profile without endcaps, resulting in about $15\\%$ deviation in angular velocity at the mid-height of the cylinders. Aside from turbulent fluctuations caused by shearing instability near the endcaps, the bulk flow remains nearly axially independent and exhibits overall Rayleigh-stability. We characterize the scalings of the Ekman and Stewartson layer sizes with $Re$ as well as examine the effect of the ratio of the outer to inner cylinders' angular velocities on the flow. The implications of these findings for ongoing magnetorotational instability (MRI) experiments based on the similar axially bounded TC setup are also discussed. Specifically, it is shown that when imposing a constant axial magnetic field in all the considered configurations, the flow profile modified by the endcaps lowers the critical threshold for the onset of MRI that in turn can facilitate its emergence and detection in those experiments.",

Rupke, Serena Perrotta, Saloni Agrawal, Cassandra Lochhaas Submitted to ApJ, 18 pages, 15 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) are a new class of extragalactic object, with large rings of faint radio continuum emission typically spanning 100s of kpc; their origins are unknown. Previous optical spectroscopy of the central galaxy in ORC4, a classic isolated ORC, revealed spatially-extended ionized gas with strong [OII] emission and line ratios consistent with LINER emission. We present new Keck/KCWI+KCRM integral field spectroscopy covering multiple strong optical emission lines to measure the extent, morphology, and spatially-resolved kinematics and line ratios of the ionized and neutral gas in the ORC4 central galaxy. We find that [OII] is the strongest optical emission line in this massive, old galaxy, and the [OII] emission is more spatially extended than other optical lines, including H-alpha. The gas kinematics show strong spatial asymmetries, high velocity gradients (>100 km/s), and high velocity dispersion (~200 km/s). The emission line ratios are most consistent with shock models with shock velocities of ~200-300 km/s and are not fit well by AGN photoionization models. These findings strongly suggest that the gas in the ORC4 central galaxy is the result of shock ionization in and around the central galaxy, likely associated with the event that created the large-scale radio ring of emission that identified this source as an ORC.",

In addition to the trove of spectra, the large number of repeat observations (197,521 duplicate spectra) enables evaluation of the survey's spectrophotometric quality. To unlock this potential, we introduce the eBOSS Data Analysis Pipeline (eBOSS-DAP), adapted from the MaNGA-DAP, which delivers uniform measurements of emission-line fluxes and equivalent widths, stellar and gas kinematics, continuum spectral indices, and stellar population fits. Using the eBOSS-DAP, we successfully analyze 1,899,553 high-quality galaxy spectra below a redshift of $z < 1.12$ to produce an extensive spectroscopic catalog for the eBOSS galaxy sample. We characterize the calibration performance, quantify the reliability of the derived measurements, and release a suite of data products that fully exploit the power of the eBOSS dataset. These catalogs open the door to a new generation of studies in galaxy evolution and cosmology.",

While many previous studies have analyzed thermal instability in uniform medium, the instability mechanism in gravitationally stratified medium like CGM has not been fully analyzed. This study investigates how gravity affects the behavior of thermal instability through linear perturbation this http URL find that in stratified medium, thermal instability can drive over-stable modes, a behavior distinctly different from the monotonic growth of thermal instability in a uniformmedium. Furthermore, we find that the combination of buoyancy and thermal instability drives other two unstable modes. Applying our results to a simplified model of the CGM, we estimate the gas accretion rate from the CGM to the Galactic disk and the typical size of high-velocity cloud driven by thermal instability to be a few solar masses per year. This gas accretion rate is comparable to the observed star formation rate, and hence, the mass in the Galactic disk can be maintained. Our results provide a theoretical framework for understanding the formation of multi-phase gas, particularly in the CGM.",

Central star formation activity fundamentally anti-correlates with Sérsic index, indicating reduced activity in bulge-dominated systems. Spatially resolved UVJ colors reveal heterogeneous internal star formation, distinguishing star-forming regions in quiescent hosts from those in globally star-forming systems. These findings demonstrate that quenching mechanisms were effectively operating by $z \\sim 2$, with the observed inside-out patterns and morphological correlations consistent with AGN-driven feedback processes.

We show that CAM is determined by the ratio of the azimuthal to radial actions (${J_\\phi}^\\prime / {J_r}^\\prime$) in the analytical Freeman bar model. We then construct a new parameter space defined by CAM versus the root-mean-square radius ($R_{RMS}$), and apply this framework to orbits in several representative rotating bar potentials. In the CAM-$R_{RMS}$ plane, periodic orbits generate well-defined branches separating distinct regions corresponding to different orbital families. Several of these branches enclose isolated areas that can be associated with specific orbital families, such as the the $x_2$ orbital family. We further validate the method using orbits from test-particle simulations, which show a well-ordered and non-overlapping distribution of orbital families in the CAM-$R_{RMS}$ plane. Since CAM is fundamentally linked to intrinsic orbital properties and readily applied to three-dimensional orbits in N-body simulations, our results establish the CAM-$R_{RMS}$ plane as a robust and efficient framework for orbit classification in rotating bars that complements conventional methods.",

Here, we evaluate GADGET4-OSAKA within the AGORA project framework by conducting a systematic comparison with its predecessor. We perform an isolated disk galaxy and a cosmological zoom-in run of a Milky Way-mass halo, following the multi-step AGORA calibration procedure. By systematically deconstructing the updated stellar feedback model, we demonstrate that mechanical momentum injection is necessary to suppress unphysical gas fragmentation and regulate star formation, yielding agreement with the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. Meanwhile, stochastic thermal heating is essential for driving a hot, metal-enriched gaseous halo, thereby creating a multiphase circumgalactic medium that is absent in the predecessor code. In the cosmological context, we calibrate the simulation to match the stellar mass growth history targeted by the AGORA collaboration. The validated GADGET4-OSAKA simulation has been contributed to the AGORA CosmoRun suite, providing a new data point for understanding the impact of numerical and physical modeling choices on galaxy evolution.",

Furuya, Yoshiaki Misugi, Yoshito Shimajiri, Kate Pattle, Shu-ichiro Inutsuka 28 pages, 12 figures, Accepted in The Astrophysical Journal (ApJ) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present an analysis of polarised dust emission at 850 micron for a parsec long filament in the northern part of the Orion B molecular cloud. The region was observed by the JCMT SCUBA-2/POL-2 polarimeter. The filament has a line mass (~80 Msun/pc) larger than the critical (magnetic) line mass (~37 Msun/pc); and hosts one starless, three prestellar, and four protostellar cores, with masses in the range 0.13 to 9.13 Msun. The mean (debiased) polarisation fraction of the filament and core pixels was calculated to be 5.3+/-0.3% and 3.2+/-0.3%, respectively, likely reflecting their distinct physical conditions. The polarisation fraction for the cores does not depend on the type of core, and was found to decrease with increasing column density, varying from 6-11% at the filament edges to 1$^{+0.7}_{-0.1}$% in the denser parts ($N_{H2}\\gtrsim$2x10$^{22}$cm$^{-2}$). Magnetic field orientation of the protostellar cores, in contrast to prestellar cores, appears to be relatively aligned with the magnetic field orientation of the local filament in this region. Using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi formalism the plane-of-sky magnetic field strength for the protostellar cores (~39-110 microG) was found to be higher than that of the prestellar cores (~22-61 microG); and weakest for the starless core (~6 microG). The average value for the filament was found to be ~31 microG. The magnetic field-volume density relation for the prestellar/starless cores and protostellar cores suggests a transition from weak field case to strong field case as the cores evolve from prestellar to protostellar phase.",

Accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal 19 December, 2025 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present spectroscopic evidence for tidal debris associated with the bulge globular cluster NGC 6569, based on medium-resolution (R ~ 11,000) Anglo-Australian Telescope spectra of 303 stars. Targets were selected using Blanco DECam Bulge Survey (BDBS) photometry and Gaia DR3 astrometry, spanning 7-30 arcmin (~1-5 rt, where rt is the King-model tidal radius) from the cluster center. Orbit-based modeling predicts a strongly time-variable Jacobi radius, with rJ ~ 8-11 arcmin near pericenter and ~18-22 arcmin near apocenter, so stars just outside rt can be unbound and feeding leading and lagging tidal tails. We identify 40 stars with kinematics and abundances consistent with previous, or borderline, cluster membership. The seven highest-quality candidates (S/N > 30) have mean [Fe/H] = -0.83 +/- 0.14 and [alpha/Fe] = +0.38 +/- 0.06 dex, matching the bound population. Interpreting these stars as recently stripped debris implies a present-day mass-loss rate of 1.0-1.6 solar masses per Myr, or 5.6 +/- 1.3% of the current cluster mass per Gyr. These results indicate ongoing tidal stripping of NGC 6569 and quantify its contribution to the bulge field. This paper is part of the Milky Way Bulge Extra-Tidal Star Survey (MWBest) and is our first detailed debris study of a massive bulge globular cluster.",

Tanaka, Kenji Furuya, Ankan Das Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal (ApJ) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We report ALMA continuum and molecular line observations at 0.1 pc resolution toward the super star cluster (SSC) candidate H72.97-69.39 in the N79 region of the LMC. The continuum emission has a sharp peak around the SSC candidate but is also widely distributed. We identify two continuum sources at the northern (N79S-1) and northwestern (N79S-2) positions of the SSC continuum peak, associated with CH$_3$OH emission. In addition to CH$_3$OH, we also detect H$_2$CO, H$_2$CS, CS, SO, CO, CN, and CCH at the positions of N79S-1 and N79S-2. The rotation diagram analysis of CH$_3$OH and SO lines yields an average gas temperature of 13 $\\pm$ 0.4 K for N79S-1 and 15 $\\pm$ 0.9 K for N79S-2. Most emission lines exhibit line widths of less than 2.8 km s$^{-1}$, consistent with emissions from cold, dense molecular cloud cores. The abundance of cold CH$_3$OH gas is estimated to be (2.1 $\\pm$ 1.1)$\\times$ 10$^{-9}$ at N79S-1 and (4.5 $\\pm$2.5)$\\times$ 10$^{-10}$ at N79S-2. Despite the lower metallicity in the LMC, the CH$_3$OH abundance at N79S-1 is comparable to that of similar cold sources in our Galaxy. However, the formation of organic molecules is inhibited throughout the N79 regions, as can be seen in the non-detection of CH$_3$OH in most of the regions. The two positions N79S-1 and N79S-2 would be exceptional positions, where CH$_3$OH production is efficient. The possible origins of cold CH$_3$OH gas in these dense cores are discussed, along with a possible explanation for the non-detection of CH$_3$OH in the SSC candidate.",

It is generally expected that mergers are the main drivers of galaxy mass growth through the accretion of mass and the triggering of new star formation episodes, while the shocks and torques induced by the merger may drive gas and dust to central supermassive black holes and fuel active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity and producing both positive and negative feedback. We test whether a merger-AGN-star formation connection exists by selecting samples of galaxy pairs of stellar masses log(M/Msun) approximately 10.2 and 11.4 within the redshift of 0.25 at various projected separation and velocity differences in an increasing order, and therefore having a decreasing probability of being truly bound and interacting. We identify galaxies in close pairs and then measure their star formation rates (SFRs) (via their NUV - r colours) and the degree of AGN activity (from X-rays, radio emission at 20cm, WISE infrared colours, and emission line ratios) as a function of their projected separation and velocity difference. We find only weak evidence that galaxies in pairs have higher SFRs as galaxies become closer in projected and velocity separation, except possibly for pairs at closest separation of less than 20 kpc and velocity difference less than 500 km/s. Similarly, we see no strong evidence that AGN are more common for galaxies in closer pairs, irrespective of the method used to detect AGN. For this sample, we do not find any clear evidence that mergers and interactions may play a significant role in triggering star formation and AGN activity, opposite to expectations from theoretical models invoking feedback episodes. Secular processes may be more important, although this may depend on the selection of galaxies and indicators for star formation and AGN activity.",

Taylor 22 pages, 5 tables and 19 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics (A&A) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Using the equatorial Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) dataset, we investigate how the low-redshift galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) varies across different galaxy populations and as a function of halo mass. We find that: (i) The GSMF of passive and star-forming galaxies are well described by a double and a single Schechter function, respectively, although the inclusion of a second component for the star-forming population yields a more accurate description. Furthermore, star-forming galaxies dominate the low-mass end of the total GSMF, whereas passive galaxies mainly shape the intermediate-to-high-mass regime. (ii) The GSMF of central galaxies dominates the high-mass end, whereas satellites and ungrouped galaxies shape the intermediate-to-low-mass regime. Additionally, we find a relative increase in the abundance of low-mass galaxies moving from dense group environments to isolated systems. (iii) More massive halos host more massive galaxies, have a higher fraction of passive systems, and show a steeper decline in the number of intermediate-mass galaxies. Finally, our results reveal larger differences between passive and star-forming GSMFs than predicted by a phenomenological quenching model, but generally confirm the environmental quenching trends for centrals and satellites reported in other works.",

They are ideal locations to study the impact of an extreme environment on the evolution of the Stellar Mass Function (SMF), which describes the statistical distribution of galaxies as a function of their stellar masses. In this work, we examine how the SMF of galaxies depends on factors such as the surrounding environments, whether they reside in isolated fields or clusters. We use the 9-band photometric galaxy data of the G9 patch from the Kilo Degree Survey (optical) and the VISTA Kilo-Degree Infrared Galaxy Survey (infrared), containing around 3.7 million galaxies, overlapping with the cluster catalog provided by the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Surveys (eFEDS). After applying appropriate selection criteria, we have 105 eFEDS clusters within the redshift range 0.385-0.8, covering $\\sim 46$ square degrees. The large, continuous overlap of the surveys allows us to examine the SMF of the cluster galaxies within the cluster-centric radial bins up to $5R_{500}$. We find a clear detection of the cluster galaxy SMF up to $2R_{500}$ beyond which it's consistent with the background. We divide the cluster sample into redshift, mass, and X-ray luminosity bins to examine their impact on the SMF. The SMF of cluster galaxies for the high-mass clusters shows a decline at low stellar masses ($M_*\\lesssim 2\\times 10^{10}M_\\odot$) within $0-0.5R_{500}$, as compared to a flat SMF for the low-mass clusters, suggesting the low-mass galaxies grow over time before reaching the cluster center. Additionally, we find a flatter SMF for the low redshift bin within $0.5R_{500}$ at stellar masses $M_*< 10^{10}M_\\odot$. We also examined the effect of cluster ellipticity on the cluster galaxy SMF; however do not find statistically significant differences between the high and the low ellipticity clusters.",

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) JWST has discovered an early period of galaxy formation that was more vigorous than expected, which has challenged our understanding of the early Universe. In this work, we present the longest spectroscopic integration ever acquired by JWST/MIRI. This spectrum covers the brightest rest-frame optical nebular emission lines for the luminous galaxy JADES-GS-z14-0 at $z > 14$. Most notably, we detect $[\\mathrm{OIII}] \\lambda\\lambda 4959,5007$ at $\\approx 11 \\sigma$ and $\\mathrm{H}\\alpha$ at $\\approx 4 \\sigma$ with these ultra-deep observations. These lines reveal that JADES-GS-z14-0 has low dust attenuation with a recent star-formation rate of $\\mathrm{SFR} \\approx 10 \\pm 2\\ M_{\\odot} / \\mathrm{yr}$, star-formation rate surface density of $\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{SFR}} \\approx 23 \\pm 5\\ M_{\\odot}/\\mathrm{yr}/\\mathrm{kpc}^{2}$, and ionizing photon production efficiency of $\\xi_{\\mathrm{ion}} \\approx 10^{25.3 \\pm 0.1}\\ \\mathrm{Hz/erg}$. Using standard strong-line diagnostics, we infer a gas-phase oxygen abundance of $[\\mathrm{O/H}] \\approx -1.1 \\pm 0.4$ ($\\approx 10\\%\\ Z_{\\odot}$), carbon-to-oxygen ratio of $[\\mathrm{C/O}] \\approx -0.4 \\pm 0.4$, ionization parameter of $\\mathrm{log}_{10}(U) \\gtrsim -2.4$, and density of $n_{\\mathrm{H}} \\approx 720 \\pm 210\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. Using detailed photoionization modeling, we instead derive $[\\mathrm{O/H}] \\approx -0.3_{-0.4}^{+0.4}$ ($\\approx 50\\%\\ Z_{\\odot}$) and $\\mathrm{log}_{10}(U) \\approx -1.5_{-0.4}^{+0.3}$. The inferred properties of JADES-GS-z14-0 are similar to those measured for similarly luminous galaxies at $z > 10$ with previous MIRI/Spectroscopy, such as GHZ2/GLASSz12, GN-z11, and MACS0647-JD1. Existing simulations are unable to reproduce the empirical and inferred properties of JADES-GS-z14-0. This work demonstrates an important step toward understanding the formation of the first stars and heavy elements in the Universe. [Abridged]",

You can read the call here: this https URL Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Dwarf galaxies ($M_{\\star} \\lesssim 10^{9} M_{\\odot}$) are the most numerous galaxies in the Universe and critical probes of dark matter, baryonic feedback, and galaxy formation. Despite significant progress from wide-field imaging surveys, the majority of dwarf candidates beyond the Local Group will lack spectroscopic follow-up, leaving fundamental questions about their internal kinematics, stellar populations, chemical enrichment, and dark matter content unresolved. Existing and planned facilities cannot efficiently provide the necessary spectroscopy for low-surface-brightness dwarfs over wide areas. We advocate for a dedicated large-aperture ($\\geq 20$ m), wide-field, highly multiplexed spectroscopic facility with deployable or monolithic IFUs, capable of high signal-to-noise observations down to $I_{\\rm E} \\gtrsim 22-23$ mag. Such a facility would enable transformative studies of dark matter cores, baryonic feedback, tidal interactions, environmental effects, and stellar populations, extending the spectroscopic exploration of low-mass galaxies to $z \\sim 1.5$, and providing decisive tests of $\\Lambda$CDM and alternative dark matter models. Beyond dwarfs, this capability would impact galaxy evolution, strong and weak lensing studies, and cosmology, ensuring that imaging data from the 2030s and 2040s can be fully exploited.",

Forbes, Harvey Butler Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The third macroscopic interstellar object detected in the solar system recently passed through perihelion, with the best-fitting models of its trajectory now featuring non-gravitational accelerations. We assess how much mass loss is required to produce plausible non-gravitational acceleration solutions and compare with estimates of the mass loss. We find that they are consistent when the nucleus of 3I/ATLAS is around 1 km in diameter. For a recent solution with a time lag in the acceleration from Eubanks et al, we find diameters between 820 meters and 1050 meters, assuming an outgassing asymmetry factor $\\zeta=0.5$ and a density of the comet nucleus $\\rho=0.5$ g cm$^{-3}$. The limits on the diameter scale as $(\\zeta/\\rho)^{1/3}$. Substantial extrapolation is required in general to compare non-gravitational accelerations to mass loss rates, so reliable estimates of the mass loss rate at other stages of the comet's trajectory will substantially reduce the systematic uncertainty in this estimate.",

Point-spread function (PSF) photometry is employed to mitigate the effects of stellar crowding and to ensure accurate measurements in this densely populated region. This method, applied to merged observations from UIST and WFCAM in the $J$, $H$, and $K$ bands, extracts $211,179$ stars by cross-matching frame-by-frame across 39 observing nights in three bands. From this, we identify approximately 750 long-period variables (LPVs), predominantly Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars, by cross-matching PSF results with aperture photometry, focusing on the UIST field for robust variability confirmation. The PSF approach proves particularly effective for resolving blended sources and detecting faint, dusty variables that might remain undetected. We also examined aperture photometry data to validate our results; however, the PSF-derived measurements provide superior depth and completeness, particularly for obscured stellar populations. The resulting master catalog provides a basis for future analyses of variability amplitudes, periods, and star-formation history (SFH), paving the way for a deeper understanding of mass-loss and the dynamical evolution of the central region of M33.",

To be submitted. Comments are welcome Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Wide-binary stars, separated by thousands of AU, reside in low-acceleration regimes where Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) predicts deviation from Newtonian gravity. However, Gaia radial velocities (RVs) lack the precision to resolve the small velocity differences expected in these systems, limiting previous MOND analyses to two-dimensional kinematics. In this paper, we introduce a technique to measure differential RVs of wide binary stars using high resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra. We apply this method to measure differential RVs of 100 wide-binaries from the C3PO survey and achieved precisions of $8-15$ m/s per binary pair, a $\\sim 10-100 \\times$ improvement (median $\\sim 24 \\times$) over Gaia DR3. Combining these measurements with Gaia astrometry, we construct a hierarchical Bayesian model to infer the orbital elements of all wide-binary pairs and the global MOND acceleration scale ($a_0$). We test two commonly used interpolating functions in MOND formulation: the simple form ($b=1, \\mu = x/(1+x)$) and the standard form ($b=2, \\mu = x/\\sqrt{1+x^2}$). Our results indicate tension with MOND at the presently accepted $a_0$ value: for $b=1$, the canonical value is excluded at $3.1\\sigma$, while for $b=2$, the exclusion is at $1.9\\sigma$.",

Shabala (University of Tasmania) 18 pages, 11 figures. Accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS 00183-7111 ($z=0.328$) is one of the three ULIRGs that are currently known to host an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with small-scale radio jets. We present a detailed study of the link between galaxy merger, AGN ignition, radio jet expansion and kpc-scale molecular outflow in IRAS 00183-7111, using high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the $^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{12}$CO(3-2) lines and very deep $i$-band VLT Survey Telescope (VST) imaging. The latter allows us to put constraints on the assembly history of the system, suggesting that it formed through a major merger between two gas-rich spirals, likely characterised by a prograde encounter and no older than $\\approx2$~Gyr. The recent merger channelled about $(1.5\\pm0.3)\\times10^{10}$~M\\textsubscript{$\\odot$} of molecular gas in the central regions of the remnant, as traced by the CO detections. The spatial correlation between the CO distribution and the radio core suggests that this gas likely contributed to the ignition of the AGN and thus to the launch of the radio jets. Furthermore, by comparing the relative strength of the two CO transitions, we find extreme gas excitation (i.e.\\,$T_{\\rm ex}\\gg50$~K) around the radio lobes, supporting the case for a jet-ISM interaction. A qualitative study of the CO kinematics also demonstrates that, despite the overall disturbed dynamical state with no clear signs of regular rotation, at least one non-rotational kinematic component can be identified and likely associated to an outflow with $v_{\\rm out}\\approx439$~km~s$^{-1}$ and $\\dot{M_{\\rm out}}\\approx 609$~M$_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$.",

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Interstellar medium widely exists in the universe at multi-scales. In this study, we introduce the {\\it Multi-scale Decomposition Reconstruction} method, an equation-based model designed to derive width maps of interstellar medium structures and predict their volume density distribution in the plane of the sky from input column density data. This approach applies the {\\it Constrained Diffusion Algorithm}, based on a simple yet common physical picture: as molecular clouds evolve to form stars, the density of interstellar medium increases while their scale decreases. Extensive testing on simulations confirms that this method accurately predicts volume density with minimal error. Notably, the equation-based model performs comparably or even more accurately than the AI-based DDPM model(Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models), which relies on numerous parameters and high computational resources. Unlike the \"black-box\" nature of AI, our equation-based model offers full transparency, making it easier to interpret, debug, and validate. Their simplicity, interpretability, and computational efficiency make them indispensable not only for understanding complex astrophysical phenomena but also for complementing and enhancing AI-based methods.",

This work presents Capotauro, a F356W-dropout in the CEERS survey with F444W AB magnitude of $\\sim27.68$ and a sharp $>3$ mag flux drop between $3.5{-}4.5\\,\\mu$m, undetected below $3.5\\,\\mu$m. We combine JWST/NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/MSA data with HST/ACS and WFC3 observations to perform a spectro-photometric analysis of Capotauro using multiple SED-fitting codes. Our setup tests $z\\geq15$ as well as $z<10$ dusty, Balmer-break or strong-line galaxy solutions, and the possibility of Capotauro being a Milky Way sub-stellar object. Among extragalactic options, our analysis favors interpreting the sharp drop as a Lyman break at $z\\sim32$, consistent with the epoch of formation of the first stars and black holes, with only $\\sim0.5\\%$ of the posterior volume at $z<25$. Lower-redshift solutions struggle to reproduce the extreme break, suggesting that if Capotauro lies at $z<10$, it must show a non-standard combination of strong dust attenuation and/or Balmer breaks, making it a peculiar interloper. Alternatively, its properties match a very cold (Y2-Y3 type) brown dwarf or a free-floating exoplanet with a record-breaking combination of low temperature and large distance ($T_{\\mathrm{eff}}<300\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $d\\gtrsim130\\,\\mathrm{pc}$, up to $\\sim2\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$). While current data cannot determine its nature, Capotauro emerges as a remarkably unique object in all plausible scenarios, and a compelling target for follow-up.",

Zamorani Published in A&A. 8 pages + Appendix. 4 tables, 6 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Little red dots (LRDs) are a puzzling population of extragalactic sources whose origin is highly debated. In this {work}, we performed a comprehensive stacking analysis of NIRCam, MIRI, and ALMA images of a large and homogeneously selected sample of LRDs from multiple JWST Legacy fields. We report clear evidence of hot-dust emission in the median stacked spectral energy distribution (SED) that features a rising near-infrared continuum up to rest-frame $\\lambda_{\\rm rest}$$\\sim$ 3$\\mu$m, which is best explained by a standard dusty active galactic nucleus (AGN) structure. Although LRDs are likely to be a heterogeneous population, our findings suggest that most ($\\gtrsim$50 %) LRDs show AGN-heated dust emission, regardless of whether the optical and ultraviolet (UV) continua are stellar or AGN-dominated. In either case, the best-fit dusty-AGN SED, combined with the lack of X-ray detection in the deep Chandra stacks, suggests that Compton-thick ($N_{\\rm H}$$>$3$\\times$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) gas obscuration is common, and likely confined within the dust sublimation radius ($R$$_{\\rm sub}$$\\sim$0.1 pc). Therefore, we argue that AGN-heated dust does not directly obscure either the optical-UV continuum or the broad-line region emission, in order to explain the observed blue UV slopes and prominent Balmer features. While a gas-dust displacement is in line with several models, the formation scenario (in-situ or ex-situ) of this pre-enriched hot dust remains unclear.",

Comments and suggestions welcome. 40 pages, 27 figures, 4 tables, 12 appendices Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Ices imprint strong absorption features in the near- and mid-infrared, but until recently they have been studied almost exclusively with spectroscopy toward small samples of bright sources. We show that JWST photometry alone can reveal and quantify interstellar ices, and we present a new open-source modeling tool, icemodels, to produce synthetic photometry of ices based on laboratory measurements. We provide reference tables indicating which filters are likely to be observably affected by ice absorption. Applying these models to NIRCam data of background stars behind \\refereeseveral Galactic Center (GC) clouds \\referee(dust ridge clouds A [the Brick], C, and D), and validating against NIRSpec spectra of Galactic disk sources, we find clear signatures of CO, H$_2$O, and CO$_2$ ices and evidence for excess absorption in the F356W filter likely caused by CH-bearing species such as methanol. The ice ratios differ between the Galactic disk and Center, with GC clouds showing a higher H$_2$O fraction. \\refereeA large ice abundance \\refereeis observed in CO, H2O, and possibly complex molecules, \\refereewhich implies that there is substantial freezeout and therefore potential for ice-phase chemistry in non-star-forming gas. Accounting for all likely ices, we infer that $>25%$ of the total carbon is frozen into CO ice in the GC, which exceeds the entire solar-neighborhood carbon budget. By assuming the freezeout fraction is the same in GC and disk clouds, we obtain a metallicity measurement indicating that $Z_GC\\gtrsim2.5Z_\\odot$. These results demonstrate that photometric ice measurements are feasible with JWST and capable of probing the metallicity structure of the cold interstellar medium.",

MEGARA targets the southeastern (SE) filaments (3 kpc from the nucleus), coincident with the only known molecular gas clump, and the far eastern (FE) filament (15 kpc), spatially isolated within an old radio lobe. SITELLE fully maps the filaments, offering the first complete views of their kinematics and excitation. Combined with archival ALMA, MUSE and Chandra data, these observations offer a multi-phase view of gas dynamics. The filaments display complex motions inconsistent with simple rotation. Velocity structure functions (VSFs) of the warm and cold gas in the central and SE filaments show consistent steep slopes (2/3) and flattening on small scales of a few hundred parsecs, possibly suggesting energy injection from Type Ia supernovae, though interpretation is method-limited. The FE filament shows a lower VSF amplitude, suggesting less active driving. ALMA CO emission is co-spatial and kinematically aligned with the ionized gas, the latter showing broader velocity dispersions. Ionization diagnostics indicate AGN-related processes (e.g., shocks) dominate, with higher-energy excitation near the radio lobes and lower-energy fossil feedback signatures in the FE filament. Finally, the filaments follow the same strong H$\\alpha$-X-ray surface brightness correlation seen in other clusters, supporting local thermal coupling between phases. However, the FE filament deviates from this trend, possibly due to uplift from past AGN outbursts or limitations in the analysis method.",

Published on Astronomy and Computing Astronomy and Computing, Volume 55, April 2026, 101051 Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The increasing availability of high-quality optical and near-infrared spectroscopic data, as well as advances in modelling techniques, have greatly expanded the scientific potential of spectroscopic studies. However, the software tools needed to fully exploit this potential often remain fragmented across multiple specialised packages, requiring scripting skills and manual integration to handle complex workflows. In this paper we present SPAN (SPectral ANalysis), a cross-platform, Python-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) software that unifies the essential tools for modern spectral analysis within a single, user-friendly environment. While SPAN can be used with a variety of spectroscopic targets, its primary focus is the analysis of unresolved galaxy spectra. SPAN allows users to extract 1D spectra from FITS images and datacubes, perform spectral processing (e.g. Doppler correction, continuum modelling, denoising), and carry out detailed analyses, including line-strength measurements, stellar and gas kinematics, and stellar population studies, using both built-in routines and the widely adopted pPXF algorithm for full spectral fitting. It runs natively on Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android, and is fully task-driven, requiring no prior coding experience. We validate SPAN by comparing its output with existing pipelines and literature studies. By offering a flexible, accessible, and well integrated environment, SPAN simplifies and accelerates the spectral analysis workflow, while maintaining scientific accuracy.",

The MCI provides three imaging channels, which are the NUV channel, the Blue channel and the Red channel, with the wavelength range of 255-430 nm, 430-700 nm, and 700-1000 nm, respectively. MCI's three channels can target the same field simultaneously, which is unique compared to other imagers onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) or the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Each channel employs a CCD focal plane of 9216 x 9232 pixels and $\\sim$7\\arcmin.5 x 7\\arcmin.5 field of view (FOV), which are about $\\gtrsim 4$ times greater than the FOVs of HST imagers. The MCI's three channels feature unprecedented sensitivities and field of views complement the NUV and visible capabilities of the CSST for high-precision photometry and weak-signal detection, which would help build a new standard-star system and the deepest UV-Optical exposures for CSST. Rich filter sets of MCI would help explore other sciences such as local emission line mapping, high-z Ly$\\alpha$ emitters searching, etc. Here we present key design features, results of current ground tests, and suggested observing strategies of the MCI.",

Ivlev, Tommaso Grassi, Paola Caselli, Volker Springel 16 pages, 12 Figures; accepted, updated for proof Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present an implementation of radiative transfer with flux-limited diffusion (FLD) for the moving-mesh code {\\small AREPO} and use the method in a physical model for the formation of protostars with non-ideal radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD). We follow previous work in splitting the additional terms to the hydrodynamical equations arising from the inclusion of radiation into terms to be integrated explicitly and implicitly, as the diffusion and coupling terms would impose very restrictive timestep criteria. We validate the scheme with standard test problems for radiation diffusion, matter-gas coupling, and radiative shocks from the literature. Our implementation is compatible with local timestepping, which often presents problems for implicit schemes, and we found very good agreement with results obtained with global timesteps. We present an example application of the new implementation to the collapse of a $1\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$ molecular cloud core to a second Larson core modelled with radiation non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics. A high-velocity jet with v$_{\\rm rad}> 10\\, {\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ is self-consistently launched from the second core, nested within the first core, which produces a lower-velocity magnetorotational outflow. We observe magnetic field amplification up to more than $\\vert \\mathbf{B}\\vert_{\\rm max}>10^5$ G in the second core, which is surrounded by a small (<0.5 au) disk. This application demonstrates the robustness of our scheme in multi-scale and high-resolution simulations on arbitrary meshes and, as such, the model can be readily used for further simulations of protostar formation at high resolution.",

A strong signal with a period of 70-100 minutes was detected in wavelet analyses of the two-minute cadence light curve from Sector 20. This signal was detected also in observations from Sectors 47 and 60. The QPP persisted for weeks in sector 20 and spanned nearly three years of TESS coverage. There was no significant damping between major flares. This behavior contrasts with that of previously reported stellar QPPs, which are confined to individual flares and decay on timescales of minutes to hours. The oscillation amplitude is at the milli-magnitude level. A pulsation origin is discarded since theoretical instability strips for 100-minute pulsations are restricted to pre-main sequence stars, while GJ 3512 is an intermediate age (2-8 Gyr) main-sequence dwarf. The persistence across independent TESS sectors discards an instrumental artifact origin and points to a likely coronal origin instead, such as oscillatory reconnection or thermal non-equilibrium cycles in large active regions. This represents the first detection of a likely sustained QPP with these characteristics in a late-type star, highlighting the need for further investigation into physical mechanisms behind such variability.",

Shapiro 15 pages, 10 figures; submitted to A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The rotation-activity relationship of G-type stars results from surface magnetic fields emerging from the interior. How the magnetic flux and its emergence rate scale with rotation rate are not well understood, both observationally and theoretically. We aim at constraining the emerging magnetic flux as a function of the rotation rate in solar-type stars by numerical simulations compared to empirical constraints set by direct measurements of stellar magnetic fields. We use our Flux Emergence And Transport (FEAT) model for stars with a range of power-law slopes for the dependence of emerging flux on rotation. Complementing this with a heuristic account of the main flux components, we model the resulting mean unsigned field strength as a function of the rotation rate. We compare the results with the Zeeman-intensification measurements and spectropolarimetric data of solar-type stars. Deviations of the model from observations of G stars correlate strongly with stellar metallicity ($r=0.83$) and effective temperature ($r=-0.76$), with a combined coefficient of 0.90, reflecting the dependence of magnetic activity on these two parameters. Correcting for these effects with multilinear regression, we find that magnetic flux emergence rates must scale steeply with rotation power-law exponent of about 1.9) to reproduce observed field strengths, significantly exceeding the estimates in the literature. We also provide correction factors for metallicity and temperature for measurements of early-G-type stellar magnetic fields. Stellar magnetic flux emergence rates scale steeply with rotation, requiring active-region fields to dominate the total surface flux on rapid rotators, whereas small-scale-dynamo fields dominate for slow rotators like the Sun. Metallicity significantly influences the rotation-magnetism relationship, necessitating sample-dependent corrections for accurate stellar dynamo modelling.",

Yoon, Gregory G. Howes, Daniel Verscharen, Benjamin L. Alterman Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Some plasma instability thresholds, derived from linear theory, constrain the observed parameters of solar wind velocity distributions, defining boundaries of ``allowed'' plasma parameters. These thresholds typically account for a single source of free energy, such as temperature anisotropy or a drifting secondary component with some dependence on other system parameters, e.g. the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure, $\\beta$. Excursions beyond these thresholds result in the emission of energy, transferred from particles to coherent electromagnetic waves, acting to push the system toward a more stable configuration. In this work, we use linear theory to define parametric limits for a low-$\\beta$ plasma that contains a drifting proton beam or helium ($\\alpha$)-particle population. A sufficiently fast and dense drifting population triggers an Oblique Drift Instability (ODI). This instability decreases the velocity drift between the thermal proton and secondary populations and prevents $\\beta$ from decreasing below a minimum value by heating both the core and drifting populations. Our predictions are of interest for \\emph{Parker Solar Probe} observations, as they provide an additional mechanism for perpendicular heating of ions active in the vicinity of \\Alfven surface. The ODI also explains the discrepancy between long-standing expectations of measurements of very low-$\\beta$ plasmas with very large temperature anisotropies in the near-Sun environment and in situ observations, where $\\beta$ is consistently measured above a few percent and the secondary populations drifting faster than the bulk of proton population by no more than approximately one \\Alfven velocity.",

Code available at this https URL Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Applications (stat.AP) We develop a new and powerful method to analyze time series to rigorously detect flares in the presence of an irregularly oscillatory baseline, and apply it to stellar light curves observed with TESS. First, we remove the underlying non-stochastic trend using a time-varying amplitude harmonic model. We then model the stochastic component of the light curves in a manner analogous to financial time series, as an ARMA+GARCH process, allowing us to detect and characterize impulsive flares as large deviations inconsistent with the correlation structure in the light curve. We apply the method to exemplar light curves from TIC13955147 (a G5V eruptive variable), TIC269797536 (an M4 high-proper motion star), and TIC441420236 (AU Mic, an active dMe flare star), detecting up to $145$, $460$, and $403$ flares respectively, at rates ranging from ${\\approx}0.4$--$8.5$~day$^{-1}$ over different sectors and under different detection thresholds. We detect flares down to amplitudes of $0.03$%, $0.29$%, and $0.007$% of the bolometric luminosity for each star respectively.

However, some metric type II bursts have occasionally been reported to occur in the absence of a CME and to be associated with weak solar activities. This study aims to identify the driver of the coronal shock in this kind of type II event. We investigate a high-frequency metric type II burst with clear band splitting, observed simultaneously by the Chashan Broadband Solar radio spectrograph and the Nançay Radioheliograph. It is associated with a C3.1-class flare and a small-scale jet, but without a detectable CME in the coronagraphs. The type II burst is preceded by multiple type III bursts, one of which exhibits characteristics of a type N burst. The type II burst source is associated with the jet-induced perturbation front propagating through nearby closed loops at a speed of $\\sim$880 km s$^{-1}$, rather than the much slower jet front. This suggests that the disturbance initiated by the jet can convert to a shock wave within low Alfvénic coronal loops, providing the necessary conditions for electron acceleration and subsequent radio emission. Our findings offer new insights into the formation mechanism of high-frequency type II bursts associated with weak flares and jets.",

However, analogous short-time scale field changes preceding eruptions are rarely reported. In this study, we present the first detailed analysis of a pre-flare decrease in the photospheric horizontal magnetic field ($B_h$) associated with an X1.8 class flare, using high-cadence vector magnetic field data from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We identify a region of gradual, spatially coherent $B_h$ decrease of about 100 G along the flaring polarity inversion line (PIL) during 30 minutes preceding the flare. This decrease is accompanied by a decrease in the force-free parameter $\\alpha_w$, with no significant flux emergence or cancellation observed. After the flare onset, $B_h$ exhibited contrasting behaviors in different sub-regions: a step-like increase near the PIL and a continued decrease in surrounding regions, suggesting that the pre-flare $B_h$ decrease may also have a coronal origin, like its post-flare counterparts. Coronal imaging from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard SDO reveals that the associated erupting filament underwent a slow-rise phase before the flare, whose timing and location closely matches the occurrence of the pre-flare $B_h$ decrease. We propose that the slow-rise of the pre-eruptive filament stretched overlying coronal loops, increasing their verticality and thereby reducing $B_h$ at their photospheric footpoints. The results present the first detailed analysis of a pre-flare $B_h$ decrease and suggest it as a precursor to solar eruptions, causally linked to early filament activation and its impact on the photosphere.",

We address this problem by introducing a simple preprocessing step that normalises the velocity field by its magnitude. Our method preserves flow topology while suppressing shear-induced artefacts that lead to spurious detections in non-uniform, high-rotation environments. For validation, we apply this approach to high-resolution Bifrost simulations and evaluate vortex detection using four commonly employed methods: IVD, the $\\lambda_2$-criterion, the Q-criterion, and the $\\Gamma$ method. We assess which structures exhibit physically consistent rotation by using the $d$-criterion to automatically detect rotational plasma-flow features, which we use as an approximate ground truth. We find that, in the unnormalised field, a substantial fraction of detections made by the first three methods are false positive detections. Normalisation removes most of these. The $\\Gamma$ method detects true vortices but misses a large number of vortical flows. The normalisation step yields better-defined and more realistic vortex boundaries. As the $\\Gamma$ method underpins most observational analyses, current studies likely capture only a subset of vortical flows. By comparison, the other three methods detect four to five times more vortices after normalisation, suggesting that the true photospheric vortex coverage may be underestimated by a similar factor. Overall, this physically motivated preprocessing step enhances the accuracy and physical realism of vortex detection and offers a practical enhancement for analysing vortical flows in turbulent flows.",

Previous studies have identified their lower density, higher temperature, and flux rope structures. However, spectroscopic observations are still relatively scarce. In this study, we utilize the newly developed Spectral Imaging Coronagraph (SICG), Chinese H$\\alpha$ Solar Explorer (CHASE), and AIA/SDO to analyze the morphology, temperature, Doppler shift, and non-thermal velocity of two coronal cavities observed on November 13, 2024. We find that coronal cavities are distinctly visible in SICG \\ion{Fe}{14} 5303~Å and AIA 193~Å, whereas they are nearly absent in SICG \\ion{Fe}{10} 6374~Å and AIA 171~Å. The spectroscopic measurements show that the two coronal cavities display asymmetric, ring-like structures in the \\ion{Fe}{14} 5303~Å Doppler shift maps. The non-thermal velocities inside coronal cavities are significantly higher than those of the surrounding streamer areas. In addition, the core regions of coronal cavities, located directly above the prominences, exhibit the highest non-thermal velocities and Doppler velocities. Our results suggest the presence of waves and turbulence in coronal cavities, which are likely more intense than those in the adjacent streamer regions. We suggest that the interaction and exchange between the cold, dense prominence materials and the hot, low-density coronal materials are the main drivers of the waves and turbulence inside coronal cavities.",

Massone 9 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables, submitted Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are key drivers of space weather events, posing risks to both space-borne and ground-based systems. Accurate prediction of their arrival time at Earth is critical for impact mitigation. To this end, physics-informed artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have proven more effective than purely data-driven or physics-based methods, generally offering higher accuracy and better explainability than the former and lower computational cost than the latter. In this work, we propose a generalization of the physics-driven AI framework based on the classical drag-based model (DBM) by integrating the extended version of the drag-based model (EDBM). This enhancement allows us to include in the training process CME events whose interplanetary dynamics are incompatible with those assumed by the DBM. We achieve travel-time prediction accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods. We also perform a parametric robustness analysis, highlighting the stability of our approach under small variations in the drag coefficient. Furthermore, we propose a categorization of CMEs into speed regimes defined by the EDBM using a multiclass classification model based on logistic regression, which could be implemented in near-real-time operational space weather forecasting systems. The results show that the EDBM framework broadens the applicability of forecasting models while preserving good predictive accuracy.",

Movies can be found at this http URL Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The mechanism that forms dynamic type II spicules has remained elusive for many years. Their dynamical behaviour has long been linked to magnetic reconnection, yet no conclusive evidence has been provided. However, one recent observational study found signs of reconnection, as traced by Ellerman bombs (EBs), at the footpoints of many spicules. The triggering of EBs is generally linked to reconnection due to flux emergence and convective motions in the photosphere. We aim to explore whether we can connect EBs to type II spicules, and to what extent we can use EBs as an observational proxy to probe reconnection in this dynamic. We also aim to provide further insight into the mechanisms that trigger EBs. We used a simulation run with the radiative magnetohydrodynamics code Bifrost to track spicules and study the physical processes behind their formation. To detect EBs and classify the spicules, we synthesised the H-alpha line using the multilevel radiative transfer code RH1.5D. We also traced shocks and current sheets to decipher the origin of EBs and spicules. We selected one type II spicule with a strong EB near its footpoint and studied their formation in detail. A magnetoacoustic shock advects the magnetic field lines towards an oppositely directed ambient field, creating a current sheet. The current sheet accelerates dense plasma via a whiplash effect generated by reconnection into the inclined ambient field, launching the spicule. Several EB profiles trace shock- and magnetic-reconnection-induced dynamics during this process at the spicule footpoint. We present a new EB triggering mechanism in which a shock-induced current sheet reconnects, triggering an EB in the lower solar atmosphere. The shock-induced current sheet generates the launch of a type II spicule via reconnection outflows. These results provide a physical origin for the observed connection between EBs and spicules.",

This makes it possible to obtain a dynamical estimate of the WR star mass-loss rate with minimal modeling assumptions. Numerous studies have been published on this topic.

Rodríguez S., Hans Van Winckel Science white paper submitted in the context of ESO's Expanding Horizons call Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Stars and planets form, live, and evolve in unison. Throughout the life of a star, dusty circumstellar discs and stellar outflows influence the further evolution of both the star(s) and their orbiting planet(s). Planet-forming discs, winds of red giant branch (RGB) or asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and post-RGB/post-AGB discs are examples of such host environments where dust physics plays a key role. The physical processes that occur during each of these stages establishes how the Solar System as well as exoplanetary systems were formed, are evolving, and will eventually die. This White Paper aims to bridge the fields of stellar evolution and planet formation by peering into the dust kinematics and macrostructure formation, and its effect on planet-host interaction, in dusty environments from stellar birth to death. Near-future advancements in the 2030s will enable the detection, orbital monitoring and atmospheric/mineralogical characterisation of close-in (proto)planets across diverse stages of stellar evolution. To take full advantage of these developments by the 2040s, we should develop the capabilities required to image the varied dusty environments in which planets are entrained over their lifetime. This will enable extensive testing of current theoretical understandings - from the micro-scales of dust assembly to the deeply interlinked macro-scales of planet-host interactions - across diverse settings often too small, distant, and faint to be resolved in the next decade, simultaneously providing valuable constraints on the two-way interplay of dusty host environments and planetary formation/evolution.",

It is however uncertain to what extent the radiation's short-term variability contributes to these effects. We are interested in what this variability might imply for planets around M dwarf stars, and focus on Proxima Centauri (Prox Cen) for three reasons: it is an active M dwarf with high levels of variability; it hosts a likely terrestrial exoplanet within its habitable zone (HZ) that will be a prime target for future direct imaging; its proximity has led to extensive observations. We set out to produce time-resolved XUV spectra of Prox Cen that will serve as input to atmospheric models, and to characterize the intrinsic variability of the star. We analyzed the entire dataset of archival XMM-Newton observations for Prox Cen. To derive the time-resolved X-ray spectra, we implemented a new pile-up correction, a new adaptive time-binning algorithm, and a time-dependent plasma model selection. The estimated EUV spectrum is based on a published template, that we scale with proposed relationships between X-ray and EUV fluxes. We produced spectra of Prox Cen from 1 to 920 Angstrom over ~260 ks of observations with unprecedented time resolution. The instantaneous X-ray flux of Prox Cen varies between about 20 times and one-fifth of the average value over the available baseline, with significant differences between wavelengths. We further quantify how variability affects the estimated average flux when a limited number of snapshots (each typically of 30 ks exposure) are available, as is common in X-ray surveys. Future investigations of the atmospheres of Prox Cen b should fold in the time variability and uncertainties described here.",

Andriienko Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Imaging Fabry-Pérot Interferometer (FPI) observations are commonly used in solar physics to infer physical parameters in the photosphere and chromosphere through modeling of the observations. Such techniques require detailed knowledge of the spectral instrumental profile in order to produce accurate results. We present a method to characterize the spatial variation of parameters of dual-etalon FPI instruments mounted in telecentric configuration: spatially-resolved cavity separation and reflectivities of both etalons, and the prefilter variation across the field-of-view. We aim at characterizing the field-of-view dependence of the parameters of the new CRISP2 FPI. We have implemented a forward model of the FPI instrumental degradation combined with a template average quiet-Sun spectra at disk center in order to model two sets of observational data. Our method does not require any change in the optical setup or the utilization of external sources of illumination. We assess the validity of several functional forms in the calculation of the FPI transmission profiles. Our results show that (generally) the inclusion of the secondary transmission peaks at 1 times the Free Spectral Range and a detailed estimate of the prefilter curve is necessary to obtain accurate values of both etalon reflectivities. For narrow prefilters (relative to the FSR), the former requirement can be relaxed. Our results show that the cavity separation of CRISP2 is very flat, showing an RMS variation below 1.9 nm over the entire field-of-view for both etalons. Reflectivity RMS variations are 0.4% and 0.3% for the primary and secondary etalons at 617.3 nm. We have assessed data and modeling requirements in order to derive accurate FPI parameters and minimize errors in the determination of etalon reflectivities.",

Although FALs are often calculated from white noise models, many astronomical time series suffer from red noise. Prewhitening is a statistical technique in which a continuum model is subtracted from log power spectrum estimate, after which the observer can proceed with a white-noise treatment. Here we present a prewhitening-based method of calculating frequency-dependent FALs. We fit power laws and autoregressive models of order 1 to each Lomb-Scargle periodogram by minimizing the Whittle approximation to the negative log-likelihood (NLL), then calculate FALs based on the best-fit model power spectrum. Our technique is a novel extension of the Whittle NLL to datasets with uneven time sampling. We demonstrate FAL calculations using observations of $\\alpha$~Cen~B, GJ~581, HD 192310, synthetic data from the radial velocity (RV) Fitting Challenge, and {\\it Kepler} observations of a differential rotator. The {\\it Kepler} data analysis shows that only true rotation signals are detected by red-noise FALs, while white-noise FALs suggest all spurious peaks in the low-frequency range are significant. A high-frequency sinusoid injected into $\\alpha$~Cen~B $\\log R^{\\prime}_{HK}$ observations exceeds the 1\\% red-noise FAL despite having only 8.9\\% of the power of the dominant rotation signal. In a periodogram of HD 192310 RVs, peaks associated with differential rotation and planets are detected against the 5\\% red-noise FAL without iterative model fitting or subtraction.

We present high-resolution total- and polarized-intensity Ks-band images of the LkCa~15 system obtained with SPHERE using near-simultaneous reference-star differential imaging (star-hopping), yielding self-subtraction-free images beyond 0.1 arcsec. LkCa~15 hosts a ~160 au protoplanetary disk and has previously been reported to harbour candidate protoplanets at separations of 15--18 au. We analyse the disk morphology and dust properties and search for super-Jupiter planets beyond 20 au. We first model the near-infrared scattered-light images together with ALMA submillimetre continuum data using RADMC-3D and a two grain-size (micron and millimetre) compact olivine model. While this model broadly reproduces the disk geometry, it overpredicts the degree of forward scattering in the near-infrared. To investigate this discrepancy, we extract the scattering phase function S(theta) and polarized fraction P(theta) from the SPHERE data and compare them with aggregate-scattering models. The observed phase functions disfavour compact Mie spheres and are better matched by porous aggregates (CAHP). Recomputing the scattered-light models with porous CAHP grains in the disk surface layer significantly improves agreement with the observed Ks-band morphology and polarization, while retaining compact millimetre grains to reproduce the ALMA continuum. No new planetary companions are detected; we place upper mass limits of ~1.5 MJ beyond 200 au and ~3.6 MJ in the inner disk. Our results demonstrate that combining star-hopping imaging with phase-function diagnostics provides strong constraints on dust grain properties in protoplanetary disks.",

Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Space Physics (physics.space-ph); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) In this letter, we investigate the population of energetically-dominant sunward-propagating Alfvén waves (SAWs) using more than 20 years of data provided by the Wind spacecraft near 1 au. We refer to SAWs as energetically-dominant sunward-propagating Alfvén waves within inertial range scales. Key parameters such as normalized cross helicity, plasma incompressibility, and magnetic incompressibility are used to determine the SAWs. Incorporating the polarity of the heliospheric magnetic field, AW modes are identified, which enables the determination of the propagation direction. Occurrence rates of SAWs vary from 1% to 14% depending on the time scale and solar wind stream type considered. Particularly, the relationship between large-scale magnetic field switchbacks (SBs) and SAWs (for a 1-hour long time scale) is investigated. A methodology utilizing pitch angle distributions of suprathermal electron strahl is employed to identify inverted magnetic field topology. The intervals containing SAWs are cross-referenced and examined with intervals identified as SBs. For a sample of 1636 1-hour SAW intervals, 17.5% are associated with magnetic field switchbacks occurring at scales larger than one hour. The analysis lends support to the idea of switchbacks as one of the candidate sources for a portion of the SAW population.",

The action of solar gravity in Parker's hydrodynamic solar wind model is shown to be geometrically equivalent to a renormalization of the actual wind channel area via a multiplicative factor, which is precisely Chapman's hydrostatic density profile. So, Chapman's hydrostatic solar wind mechanism appears to continue to be operative, on a global level (not just locally near the coronal base), in Parker's hydrodynamic solar wind model, the effects of solar gravity in Parker's hydrodynamic model being essentially encapsulated by Chapman's hydrostatic model. This result is shown to be robust by considering both isothermal gas and polytropic gas models as well as an n-dimensional (n= 1, 2, 3) underlying space for the solar wind.",

Using high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise ratio spectra from the ESO and Keck archives, we perform a strict line-by-line differential analysis relative to the Sun to derive stellar parameters and abundances of 19 elements from C to Zn. The stars span effective temperatures of 4500-6500 K and metallicities from -0.57 to +0.50 dex. The sample includes hosts of both gas giants and terrestrial planets, allowing direct comparison between stellar composition and planetary properties. Several of the giant planets orbit metal-rich stars. The detailed abundance patterns show clear chemical diversity, including carbon-enhanced but mildly metal-poor stars (TOI-824, TOI-1130, GJ 9827) and $\\alpha$-enhanced metal-poor stars (TOI-561, GJ 9827, TOI-824). These variations trace differences in protoplanetary disk composition and may influence planetary interiors and atmospheric chemistry. The planet-hosts show a range of [C/O] ratios, and the diverse [Mg/Si] ratios may suggest varied interior compositions for their rocky planets. This homogeneous stellar abundance, together with future uniform JWST planetary atmosphere measurements, provides a foundation for exploring the planet mass-metallicity relation and the connection between stellar chemistry and planetary formation pathways. These results constitute the first step in a larger survey spanning multiple JWST cycles to systematically examine how host star composition shapes exoplanetary systems.",

While significant effort is devoted to advancing the technical capabilities of future astronomical facilities, frameworks for coordinating and sustaining the associated community systems are often developed in parallel rather than embedded as coherent, long-term structures at the scale needed to fully realise this ambition. In this white paper, submitted as part of the ESO Expanding Horizons initiative, we draw on experience from established observatories and emerging collaborations to identify key community-level challenges. We argue that a central and transversal scientific challenge for the 2040s is to operate a flagship observatory in which access to telescope time, data, leadership, training, and career development is equitable across institutions, member states, and beyond. We propose that access and participation be treated as integral design parameters, embedded from the conceptual stage and sustained throughout the facility lifecycle, in order to ensure long-term scientific excellence, sustainability, and societal return.",

To be published in PASP Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) hosts science-ready data products from over twenty NASA missions, plus community-contributed data collections, and other select surveys. The data support forefront research in the ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared wavelength bands. We have constructed bibliographies for each mission from publications in nearly 40 professional journals, and have identified more than 37,000 refereed articles where investigators made a science usage of data hosted in MAST. The publication rate over the last 50 years shows that most MAST missions have had very high productivity during their in-service lifetimes, and have remained so for years or decades afterward. Annual citations to these publications, a measure of impact on research, are robust for most missions, with citations that grow over more than a decade. Most of the citations come from about 10% of articles within each mission. We examined the bibliographies of the active missions HST and JWST in greater detail. For HST the rate of archival publications exceeded those authored by the original observing teams within a decade of launch, and is now more than 3 times higher. Early indications hint that JWST archival articles could dominate the publication rate even sooner. The production of articles resulting from any given observing program can extend for decades. Programs with small and very large allocations of observing time tend to be particularly productive per unit of observing time. For HST in general, a first publication appears within 1.5 yr for 50% of observing programs, and within 3.8 yr for 80% of programs. We discuss various external factors that affect publication metrics, their strengths and limitations for measuring scientific impact, and the challenges of making meaningful comparisons of publication metrics across missions.",

Supernovae, Kilonovae, Black-Hole formation, Novae, GRBs, and tidal disruption events are prime examples, as their earliest phases link electromagnetic radiation to gravitational waves, neutrinos, and high-energy emission. Yet, the physics connecting these messengers unfolds within minutes to hours, while traditional surveys revisit the same region of the sky on the scale of days/weeks, missing when the event begins. Current survey facilities excel at answering what happened and how often, but essentially fail in addressing how it happened and how it couples to gravitational waves, neutrinos, or high-energy emission. Continuous wide-area optical monitoring, as proposed here, removes this limitation. The traditional approach, where a GW or neutrino alert triggers electromagnetic follow-up, is now complemented, and sometimes reversed: early electromagnetic discoveries can prompt searches for weaker gravitational waves or neutrino signals that would otherwise be missed. In the Einstein Telescope era, wide-field optical monitoring will allow us to find the optical counterparts of gravitational-wave events and understand their physics. At the same time, a telescope capable of continuous monitoring provides immediate scientific value for planetary defense, space-debris tracking, stellar variability, exoplanets transit monitoring, accretion-driven activity, and when we step into a new observational territory, the true discoveries are often the ones we did not expect. In this vision, continuous time-domain astronomy does not replace classical surveys: it completes them by supplying the missing temporal dimension. Follow-up observations remain essential, but they now begin at the physical onset of the event rather than after its evolution is underway.",

Koopman, Akito Kusaka, Jack Lashner, Federico Nati, Lyman Page, Daichi Sasaki, Yoshinori Sueno, Junya Suzuki, Osamu Tajima, Tran Tsan Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Improved measurements of $B$-modes in the cosmic microwave background can be obtained through accurate calibration of the orientation of detector antennas as projected onto the sky. Miscalibration of the detector polarization angle leads to a leakage of $E$-modes into $B$-modes, which can bias the detection of the latter. To achieve a $\\sigma(r)$ of 0.003, the Simons Observatory Small Aperture Telescopes are required to calibrate the global polarization angle on the sky with an accuracy ${\\lesssim}0.1^\\circ$. We demonstrate a fully remote-controllable calibration system using a ``sparse wire grid,\" which injects a rotatable linear polarized signal across the telescope's focal plane. This calibration system is installed and operational on a Small Aperture Telescope at its observing site at the Parque Astronómico in the Atacama desert in Chile. We developed a pipeline for the detector polarization angle calibration, and demonstrate it using initial data for 93~GHz and 145~GHz frequency bands. The observed distribution of detector polarization angles is in agreement with the instrument design. Statistical uncertainties for the relatively calibrated polarization angles are $0.02^\\circ$ and $0.03^\\circ$ at 93~GHz and 145~GHz, respectively. Systematic uncertainty was evaluated to be $0.08^\\circ$ at the hardware development and fabrication stage. Their sum in quadrature is less than $0.1^\\circ$.",

Pollak, Carol Shumaker, Andrew Siemion Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Popular Physics (physics.pop-ph) In 2025 July, the third-ever interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, was discovered on its ingress into the Solar System. Similar to the NASA Voyager missions sent in 1977, science probes by extraterrestrial life (artifact ``technosignatures'') could be sent to explore other stellar systems like our own. In this campaign, we used the SETI Institute's Allen Telescope Array to observe 3I/ATLAS from 1--9~GHz. We detected nearly 74 million narrowband hits in 7.25~hr of data using the newly-developed search pipeline \\texttt{bliss}. We then applied blanking in frequency and drift rate to mitigate Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) in our dataset, narrowing the dataset down to $\\sim$2 million hits. These hits were further filtered by the localization code \\texttt{NBeamAnalysis}, and the remaining 211 hits were visually inspected in the time-frequency domain. We did not find any signals worthy of additional follow-up. Accounting for the Doppler drift correction and given the non-detection, we are able to set an Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) upper limit of $10-110$~W on radio technosignatures from 3I/ATLAS across the frequency and drift rate ranges covered by our survey.",

Santerne Accepted for publication in A&A. 19 pages, 10 figures Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) PLATO will discover exoplanets around Sun-like stars through transit photometry and characterize their host stars using asteroseismology. Since photometry for most PLATO targets will be extracted on board, an efficient strategy to detect false positives (FPs), defined as transit-like signals not caused by planets, is required. Centroid shifts are a standard FP diagnostic, but only 5% to 20% of PLATO's largest stellar sample (P5) will have centroids computed on board, motivating the need for an alternative strategy. We propose a double-aperture photometry approach to detect FPs, testing two mask types: extended masks, which enlarge the nominal aperture, and secondary masks, centered on the main contaminant. For each mask type, we derive flux and centroid-shift metrics and evaluate their ability to discriminate FPs. Using Gaia DR3, we define P5 targets and their background stars, which are assumed to be eclipsing binaries with transit depths and durations drawn from observed distributions. From simulated photometry and centroid shifts, we compute extended and secondary fluxes as well as extended, secondary, and nominal centroids, and compare their FP detection efficiency. Under these assumptions, approximately 35% of P5 targets have a single FP-producing contaminant and about 22% have two or more. Secondary flux achieves the highest detection efficiency (92%), followed by extended centroid shifts (87%) and nominal centroids (84%). Owing to its lower computational and telemetry cost, double-aperture photometry provides an efficient solution for rejecting a large fraction of FP signals caused by eclipsing binaries.",

We use LIFEsim, a software developed by the ETH LIFE team, along with thermal emission maps obtained from a suite of three-dimensional global climate model (GCM) simulations, to explore the sensitivity of LIFE to the observation geometry. We find that 3 days of observation in broadband would be enough to disentangle the hemispheres of the planet with a 1{\\sigma} or 3{\\sigma} confidence level with a baseline or optimistic scenario respectively. Doing the same for a fast-rotator in the habitable zone of a G-class star would be prohibitively challenging.

Combining values and derivatives of functions, ContEvol outputs allow users to recover full history and render full distributions. Using the classic harmonic oscillator as a prototype case, we show that ContEvol methods lead to lower-order errors than two commonly used Runge--Kutta methods. Applying first-order ContEvol to simple celestial mechanics problems, we demonstrate that deviation from equation(s) of motion of ContEvol tracks is still $\\mathcal{O}(h^5)$ ($h$ is the step length) by our definition. Numerical experiments with an eccentric elliptical orbit indicate that first-order ContEvol is a viable alternative to classic Runge--Kutta or the symplectic leapfrog integrator. Solving the stationary Schrödinger equation in quantum mechanics, we manifest ability of ContEvol to handle boundary value or eigenvalue problems. Important directions for future work, including mathematical foundations, higher dimensions, and technical improvements, are discussed at the end of this article.",

UVIa will observe whether any SNe Ia emit excess UV light shortly after explosion to test progenitor/explosion models and provide follow-up over many days to characterize their UV and optical flux variations over time, assembling a comprehensive multi-band UV and optical low-redshift anchor sample for upcoming high-redshift SNe Ia surveys (e.g., Euclid, Vera Rubin Observatory, Nancy Roman Space Telescope). UVIa's mission profile requires it to perform rapid and frequent visits to newly discovered SNe Ia, simultaneously observing each SNe Ia in two UV bands (FUV: 1500-1800A and NUV: 1800-2400A) and one optical band (u-band: 3000-4200A). In this study, we describe the UVIa mission concept science motivation and basic mission design.

We report simulations of antenna impedance and beam chromaticity, along with SDR performance tests (Limenet Mini, Ettus E310, USRP2920). A dual-stage low-noise amplifier reduces system temperature, enabling foreground-sensitive observations. Radiometric estimates suggest sub-mK sensitivity is achievable with 1000 h of integration.

Andersen, Graham Finlayson Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) This study investigates the impact of spectral filtering on color-matching functions (CMFs) and its implications for observer variability modeling. We conducted color matching experiments with two observers, both with and without a spectral filter in front of a bipartite field. Using a novel computational approach, we estimated the filter transmittance and transformation matrix necessary to convert unfiltered CMFs to filtered CMFs. Statistical analysis revealed good agreement between estimated and measured filter characteristics, particularly in central wavelength regions. Applying this methodology to compare between Stiles and Burch 1955 (SB1955) mean observer CMFs and our previously published \"ICVIO\" mean observer CMFs, we identified a \"yellow\" (short-wavelength suppressing) filter that effectively transforms between these datasets. This finding aligns with our hypothesis that observed differences between the CMF sets are attributable to age-related lens yellowing (average observer age: 49 years in ICVIO versus 30 years in SB1955). Our approach enables efficient representation of observer variability through a single filter rather than three separate functions, offering potentially reduced experimental overhead while maintaining accuracy in characterizing individual color vision differences.",

In contrast, radio interferometric arrays are designed to optimally sample the Fourier space data for making high quality images of the sky. Therefore, using existing radio interferometric arrays (with arbitrary geometry and wide frequency variation) for DOA estimation is practically infeasible except by using images made by such interferometers. In this paper, we focus on low cost DOA estimation without imaging, using a subset of a radio interferometric array, using a fraction of the data collected by the full array, and, enabling early determination of DOAs. The proposed method is suitable for transient and low duty cycle source detection. Moreover, the proposed method is an ideal follow-up step to online radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation, enabling the early estimation of the DOA of the detected RFI.",

Corbel 13 Pages, 8 Figures, 2 Tables, 2 Appendix Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The search for radio signals from exoplanets or star-planet interactions is a topic of major scientific interest, as it is likely the best way to detect and measure a planetary magnetic field and, therefore, to probe the inner structure of exoplanets. However, detecting these radio emissions is challenging, since they are anisotropic by nature, sporadic, and of low intensity because of their great distances, and because the sky cannot be monitored continuously. The aim of this article is to demonstrate the relevance of using statistical tools to detect periodic radio signals in unevenly spaced observations, and identify the implications of the measured period. The identification of periodic radio signals is achieved here by a Lomb-Scargle analysis. We first apply the technique to simulated astrophysical observations with controlled simulated noise. This allows us to characterize the origin of spurious detection peaks in the resulting periodograms, as well as to identify peaks corresponding to real periods in the studied system, and to harmonic or beat periods. We then validate this method with a real signal, using approximately 1400 hours of data from observations of Jupiter's radio emissions by the NenuFAR radio telescope over more than six years, to detect the periodicities of Jovian radio emissions (auroral and induced by the Galilean moons). We demonstrate with the simulation that the LombScargle periodogram allows us to correctly identify periodic radio signals, even in a diluted signal. On real measurements, it correctly detects the rotation period of the strong signal produced by Jupiter and the beat period of the emission triggered by the interaction between Jupiter and its Galilean moon Io, ...",

Since then, its atmosphere has been investigated using multiple telescopes and instruments. However, many of its atmospheric constraints remain debatable. While HST observations suggested a highly sub-solar metallicity, recent JWST NIRCam observations by Xue et al. 2024 constrained a super-solar metallicity with highly sub-solar C/O. In this work, we show a detailed investigation of HD 209458 b transmission spectra observations from JWST and HST using SANSAR, a newly developed planetary atmosphere modeling framework, with free, equilibrium chemistry and self-consistent grid retrievals. The overall best-fitting model with free retrievals ($\\chi^2_{\\rm{red}}$=1.21) constrains its metallicity and C/O to be highly sub-solar, while equilibrium chemistry and grid retrievals ($\\chi^2_{\\rm{red}}$=1.27 and 1.30, respectively) are consistent with solar values using STIS+WFC3+NIRCam observations. The retrieved abundances of H$_2$O and CO$_2$ are almost three orders of magnitude lower (highly sub-solar) with STIS+WFC3+NIRCam compared to just NIRCam, using free retrievals. NIRCam observations alone also result in misleading constraints on metallicity and C/O, with equilibrium chemistry and grid retrieval. We find that the model choice of varying C/H or O/H to vary the C/O in equilibrium chemistry retrievals leads to different metallicity constraints with NIRCam, but similar constraints with STIS+WFC3+NIRCam. We conclude that NIRCam observations alone can lead to overestimation of abundances for exoplanet atmospheres and, therefore, should be used in combination with UV/Optical and near-infrared observations to obtain robust constraints on abundances, C/O, and metallicity. In particular, even though we can detect the CO$_2$ feature with just NIRCam, we cannot constrain its abundances robustly without the optical baseline.",

A large timestep is desirable in order to speed up the numerical simulations. However, simulations yield unphysical results if the timestep is too large. Surprisingly, no systematic convergence study has been performed on long (Gyr) timescales. In this paper we present numerical experiments to determine the minimum timestep one has to use in long-term integrations of the Solar System in order to recover the system's fundamental secular frequencies and instability rate. We find that timesteps of up to 32 days, i.e. a third of Mercury's orbital period, yield physical results in an ensemble of 5 Gyr integrations. We argue that the chaotic diffusion that drives the Solar System's long-term evolution dominates over numerical diffusion and timestep resonances. Our results bolster confidence that the statistical results of most simulations in the literature are indeed physical and provide guidance on how to run time and energy efficient simulations while making sure results can be trusted.",

Fauchez, Sara Faggi, Avi M. Mandell, Aki Roberge, Eleonora Alei Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We present a calibrated database of reflectance spectra for the solar system planets (i.e., Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) and for Titan, spanning from the ultraviolet to the near infrared. We considered data collected over 60 years of planetary observations, employing a broad range of geometries and facilities (spacecraft and ground-based observatories). To correct for differences in observational geometries and data quality, we adopted a two-step calibration process that standardized each spectrum to the planet's geometric albedo values and corrected for planetary heterogeneity and calibration effects. The calibrated datasets were then combined across wavelengths, leading to a reference composite reflectance spectrum for each planet. As a test of this spectral library for exoplanetary research, we simulated direct imaging observations of the Proxima Centauri and HD 219134 systems as solar system analogs, as well as the solar system at a distance of 10 parsecs. We also explored the detection limitations of direct imaging instruments imposed by the inner and outer working angles for Earth and Jupiter-like exoplanets as a function of system distance. Additionally, we used the visible light portion of the results to produce realistic color reconstructions of each planet. Standardizing reflectance spectra in this work improves our baseline for interpreting new reflected light observations of exoplanets through comparative planetology. This spectral library can then serve as a calibrated and validated reference in the modeling and preparation for the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres with future direct imaging missions and for astronomical studies of the solar system.",

Such systems, however, offer a unique perspective on the stochasticity intrinsic to planet formation and evolution -- particularly in twin binary star systems, which consist of near-equal-mass stars formed contemporaneously in the same birth environment. The WASP-94 system, which includes twin F-type stars, is a striking exemplar of such systems, containing two hot Jupiters: WASP-94 Ab is a transiting, spin-orbit misaligned giant planet with a 4-day orbital period, while WASP-94 Bb is non-transiting and has a tighter 2-day orbital period. In this work, we leverage N-body simulations to show that the current double hot Jupiter configuration of the WASP-94 system can be reproduced through mirrored von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai migration. The upcoming Gaia astrometric data releases offer the potential to search for additional twin planetary systems, including double cold Jupiter systems that may serve as the progenitors for WASP-94-like configurations.",

Plumes released from this ocean preserve information on its chemical state, and previous analyses suggest weakly to strongly alkaline pH (approximately pH 8--12). Constraining the pH requires identification of pH-sensitive minerals in plume deposits. Several analytical techniques could provide such mineralogical information, but few are practical for deployment on planetary missions. Raman spectrometers, which have recently advanced for \\textit{in situ} exploration and have been incorporated into flight instruments, offer a feasible approach for mineral identification on icy moons. However, their applicability to pH estimation from plume-derived minerals has not been investigated. In this study, we evaluate whether Raman measurements of plume particles deposited on the surface of Enceladus can be used to distinguish between weakly and strongly alkaline subsurface ocean models. Fluids with pH values of 9 and 11 were frozen under vacuum conditions analogous to those on Enceladus. The resulting salt deposits were then analyzed using a flight-like Raman spectrometer. The Raman spectra show pH-dependent carbonate precipitation: NaHCO$_3$ and Na$_2$CO$_3$ peaks were detected at pH 9, whereas only Na$_2$CO$_3$ peaks were detected at pH 11. These findings demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy can distinguish pH-dependent carbonate phases. This capability allows us to constrain whether the pH of the subsurface ocean is weakly alkaline or strongly alkaline, which is a key parameter for assessing its chemical evolution and potential habitability.",

Raymond Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We investigate the dynamical stability of potential satellites orbiting the seven planets of the \\texttt{TRAPPIST-1} system using a suite of $N$-body simulations. For each planet, we show that moons can remain stable from the Roche limit out to near the theoretical prograde stability boundary at roughly $0.5$ Hill Radii. We quantify how perturbations from neighbouring planets modify these stability limits. Although the overall effect of individual perturbers is generally weak, the combined gravitational influence of the full multi-planet configuration produces a modest contraction of the outer stable radius, notably for \\texttt{TRAPPIST-1 b} and \\texttt{TRAPPIST-1 e}. For each of the seven planets, the outer stability limit for satellites is at 40-45\\% of the Hill radius, consistent with previous work. Using simple long-term tidal decay calculations, we show that the most massive satellites that could survive over Gyr timescales are $10^{-(7-9)} M_\\oplus$ (with higher possible masses for the outer planets).",

Dos Santos, David K. Sing, Zafar Rustamkulov, Nikolay K. Nikolov, Jeff Valenti, Hannah R. Wakeford 20 pages, 12 figures, 5 tables. Accepted in AJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We present high-resolution NUV observations from Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) data for the hottest known gas planet, KELT-9b. Observations were collected with STIS/E230M (2300-3000 $Å$, R$\\sim$ 30,000) and we de-correlate systematic effects from the telescope using jitter detrending. We show the clear presence of the Mg II doublet at 2800 $Å$ and Fe II at 2600 $Å$ in KELT-9b. The Mg II is measured above the planet's Roche transit radius, indicating it is escaping. We fit 1D NLTE atmospheric escape models to these features, demonstrating a significant loss of mass in KELT-9b's atmosphere ($\\dot{M} \\approx 10^{12} $ g/s); we also find a remarkably high line-broadening corresponding to a velocity of about $50-75$ km/s, and a net blueshift of the Mg II doublet greater than 30 km/s. Future 3D MHD modeling of the spectrum and gas kinematics is likely needed to explain these observations. We interpret these results in the context of the Mg II ``Cosmic Shoreline\" and show that the detection of escaping Mg II in KELT-9b and the non-detection in WASP-178b are consistent with the hypothesis that stars hotter than $T_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\sim$ 8250~K have relatively low levels of XUV radiation due to the lack of a chromosphere. Therefore planets around such early-type stars experience a different degree of atmospheric escape. This result highlights the importance of XUV irradiation in driving atmospheric escape inside and outside the Solar System.",

Until now, most studies have relied on single-spacecraft measurements, which could not simultaneously capture upstream solar wind conditions and the induced magnetic fields, thereby limiting our understanding of the system. Here, we statistically re-examine the properties of Mars' induced magnetic field by incorporating, for the first time, real-time upstream solar wind conditions from the coordinated MAVEN and Tianwen-1 observations. Our results are show that both solar wind dynamic pressure and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) magnitude enhance the strength of the induced magnetic field, but they exert opposite effects on the compression ratio: higher dynamic pressure strengthens compression, while stronger IMF weakens it. The induced field is stronger under quasi-perpendicular IMF conditions compared with quasi-parallel IMF, reflecting a stronger mass-loading effect. We further investigate the clock angle departures of the induced fields. They remain relatively small in the magnetosheath near the bow shock, increase gradually toward the induced magnetosphere, and become significantly larger within the induced magnetosphere. In addition, clock angle departures are strongly enhanced under quasi-parallel IMF conditions. Their dependence on upstream drivers further shows that, within the magnetosheath, clock angle departures are minimized under low dynamic pressure, high IMF magnitude, and low Alfven Mach number conditions. These results may enhance our understanding of solar wind interaction with Mars, and highlight the critical role of multi-point observations.",

Seligman, Vivien Parmentier, David Sing Revised title to match published version Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Claims of detections of gases in exoplanet atmospheres often rely on comparisons between models including and excluding specific chemical species. However, the space of molecular combinations available for model construction is vast and highly degenerate. Only a limited subset of these combinations is typically explored for any given detection. As a result, apparent detections of trace gases risk being artifacts of incomplete modeling rather than robust identification of atmospheric constituents, especially in the low signal-to-noise regime. Using the sub-Neptune K2-18 b as a case study, we show that recent biosignature claims vanish when the model space is expanded, with numerous alternatives providing equally good or better fits. We demonstrate that the significance of a claimed detection relies on the choice of models being compared, and that model preference does not in itself imply the presence of a specific gas. We recommend treating model comparisons instead as relative adequacy tests, which should be supported by theoretical predictions and complementary metrics of statistical significance in order to attribute a signal to a particular gas.",

Watkins Accepted for publication in A&A (20 December 2025), 22 pages, 23 figures, abstract shortened Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Gas giant planets orbiting low-mass stars are uncommon outcomes of planet formation. Increasing the sample of well-characterised giants around early M dwarfs will enable population-level studies of their properties, offering valuable insights into their formation and evolutionary histories. We aim to characterise giant exoplanets transiting M dwarfs identified by TESS. High-resolution spectroscopic data are obtained in the optical and nIR, combining HARPS and NIRPS. We derive RVs via the cross-correlation function and implement a novel post-processing procedure to further mitigate telluric contamination in the nIR. The resulting RVs are jointly fit with TESS and ground-based photometry to derive the orbital and physical parameters of the systems. We confirm two gas giants transiting the low-mass stars TOI-3288 A (K9V) and TOI-4666 (M2.5V). TOI-3288 A hosts a Hot Jupiter with a mass of $2.11\\pm0.08~M_{\\rm Jup}$ and a radius of $1.00 \\pm 0.03~R_{\\rm Jup}$, with an orbital period of 1.43 days ($T_{\\rm eq} = 1059 \\pm 20~{\\rm K}$). TOI-4666 hosts a $0.70_{-0.06}^{+0.05}~M_{\\rm Jup}$ warm Jupiter ($T_{\\rm eq} = 713 \\pm 14~{\\rm K}$) with a radius of $1.11 \\pm 0.04~R_{\\rm Jup}$, and an orbital period of 2.91 days. We identify a decrease in planetary mass with spectral type, where late M dwarfs host less massive giant planets than early M dwarfs. More massive gas giants that deviate from this trend are preferentially hosted by more metal-rich stars. Furthermore, we find an increased binarity fraction among low-mass stars hosting gas giants, which may play a role in enhancing giant planet formation around low-mass stars. The observed population trends agree with theoretical expectations, where higher metallicity can compensate for lower disk masses, and wide binary systems may influence planet formation and migration through Kozai-Lidov cycles or disk instabilities.",

      "abstract": "Unified Kraft Break at ~6500 K: A Newly Identified Single-Star Obliquity Transition Matches the Classical Rotation Break Xian-Yu Wang, Songhu Wang, J. M. Joel Ong 16 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in ApJL Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The stellar obliquity transition, defined by a $\\textit{T}_{\\rm eff}$ cut separating aligned from misaligned hot Jupiter systems, has long been assumed to coincide with the rotational Kraft break. Yet the commonly quoted obliquity transition (6100 or 6250 K) sits a few hundred kelvin cooler than the rotational break (~6500 K), posing a fundamental inconsistency. We show this offset arises primarily from binaries/multiple-star systems, which drive the cooler stellar obliquity transition ($6105^{+123}_{-133}$ K), although the underlying cause remains ambiguous. After removing binaries and higher-order multiples, the single-star stellar obliquity transition shifts upward to $6447^{+85}_{-119}$ K, in excellent agreement with the single-star rotation break ($6510^{+97}_{-127}$ K). This revision has two immediate consequences for understanding the origin and evolution of spin-orbit misalignment. First, the upward shift reclassifies some hosts previously labeled `hot' into the cooler regime; consequently, there are very few RM measurements of non-hot-Jupiter planets around genuinely hot stars ($T_{\\rm eff}\\gtrsim6500\\,\\mathrm{K}$), and previously reported alignment trends for these classes of systems (e.g., warm Jupiters and compact multi-planet systems) lose the power to discriminate the central question: are large misalignments unique to hot-Jupiter-like planets that can be delivered by high-$e$ migration, or are hot stars intrinsically more misaligned across architectures? Second, a single-star stellar obliquity transition near $6500\\,\\mathrm{K}$, coincident with the rotational break, favors tidal dissipation in outer convective envelopes; as these envelopes thin with increasing $T_{\\rm eff}$, inertial-wave damping and magnetic braking weaken in tandem.",
