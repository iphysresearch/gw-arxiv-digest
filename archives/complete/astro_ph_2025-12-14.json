      "abstract": "Popular Physics (physics.pop-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph) What does ``Big Bang'' actually mean? What was the origin of these two words? It has often been said that the expression ``Big Bang'' began as an insult. Even if this were true, it would be just an irrelevant part of the whole issue. There are many more aspects hidden under this name, and which are seldom explained. They will be discussed in this work. In order to frame the analysis, help will be sought from the highly authoritative voices of two exceptional writers: William Shakespeare and Umberto Eco. Both Shakespeare and Eco have explored the tension existing between words and the realities they name. With the conclusion that names are, in general, just labels, simple stickers put to identify things. And this includes those given to great theorems or spectacular discoveries. Not even ``Pythagoras' theorem'' was discovered by Pythagoras, as is now well-known. Stigler's law of eponymy is recalled to further substantiate those statements. These points will be at the heart of the investigation carried out here, concerning the very important concept of ``Big Bang''. Everybody thinks to know what ``the Big Bang'' is, but only very few do know it, in fact. When Fred Hoyle first pronounced these two words together, on a BBC radio program, listeners were actually left with the false image that Hoyle was trying to destroy. That is, the tremendous explosion of Lemaître's primeval atom (or cosmic egg), which scattered all its enormous matter and energy content throughout the rest of the Universe. This image is absolutely wrong! As will be concluded, today the label ``Big Bang'' is used in several different contexts: (a) the Big Bang Singularity; (b) as the equivalent of cosmic inflation; (c) speaking of the Big Bang cosmological model; (d) to name a very popular TV program; and more.",

Muñoz, Bryce Cyr Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Recent observations of high redshift galaxies by the James Webb Space Telescope suggest the presence of a bright population of galaxies that is more abundant than predicted by most galaxy formation models. These observations have led to a rethinking of these models, and numerous astrophysical and cosmological solutions have been proposed, including cosmic strings, topological defects that may be remnants of a specific phase transition in the very early moments of the Universe. In this paper, we integrate cosmic strings, a source of nonlinear and non-Gaussian perturbations, into the semi analytical code Zeus21, allowing us to efficiently predict the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF). We conduct a precise study of parameter degeneracies between star-formation astrophysics and cosmic-string phenomenology. Our results suggest that cosmic strings can boost the early-galaxy abundance enough to explain the measured UVLFs from the James Webb and Hubble Space Telescopes from redshift z = 4 to z = 17 without modifying the star-formation physics. In addition, we set a new upper bound on the string tension of $G\\mu \\lessapprox 10^{-8}$ ($95\\%$ credibility), improving upon previous limits from the cosmic microwave background. Although with current data there is some level of model and prior dependence to this limit, it suggests that UVLFs are a promising avenue for future observational constraints on cosmic-string physics.",

The joint detection of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves would provide insight into cosmic processes, such as progenitor dynamics and outflows. The joint detection of multiple cosmic messengers can also elevate the significance of the observation when some or all of the constituent messengers are sub-threshold, not significant enough to declare their detection individually. Leveraging data from the LIGO, Virgo, and IceCube observatories, we conducted an archival investigation of sub-threshold multimessenger events. Complementing previous analyses, we used minimal assumptions to search for common sources of sub-threshold gravitational-wave and high-energy neutrino candidates during the third observing run (O3) of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Our search did not identify significant joint sources. We therefore derive constraints on the rate density of joint sources for each compact binary merger population as a function of the energy emitted in neutrinos. Only a fraction of the gravitational-wave sources emit neutrinos, if the neutrino emission has high bolometric energy ($>10^{52}$ to $10^{54}$ erg).",

      "abstract": "Probing Spin-Orbit Resonances with the Binary Black Hole Population Sylvia Biscoveanu High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Measurements of the binary black hole spin distribution from the growing catalog of gravitational-wave observations can help elucidate the astrophysical processes shaping the formation and evolution of these systems. Spin-orbit resonances are one process of interest, in which the component spin vectors and the orbital angular momentum align into a common plane and jointly precess about the total angular momentum of the system. These resonances, which occur preferentially in systems formed via isolated binary evolution with strong tidal effects, lead to excesses in the distribution of the azimuthal angle between the projections of the component spin vectors onto the orbital plane at $\\phi_{12}=0,\\pm\\pi$. In this work, we conduct the first hierarchical analysis modeling the population-level distribution of $\\phi_{12}$ simultaneously with the other mass and spin parameters for simulated binary black hole populations to determine whether spin-orbit resonances can be reliably constrained. While we are unlikely to find definitive evidence for spin-orbit resonances with a population of the size expected by the end of the ongoing LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA fourth observing run, we correctly recover the various $\\phi_{12}$ distributions we simulate within uncertainties. We find that we can place meaningful constraints on the relative excesses at $\\phi_{12}=0,\\pm\\pi$, which encodes information about binary mass transfer. We can also distinguish between fully isotropic spin angle distributions and those with features in the spin azimuth and tilt distributions. Thus, we show that population-level measurements of the $\\phi_{12}$ distribution offer a reliable, novel way to probe binary formation channels, dynamics, and mass transfer with gravitational-wave observations.",

However, the necessity of splitting the dark-side world into two sectors has not been experimentally or theoretically proven. Unified dark fluid models provide an alternative in which a single fluid accounts for both phenomena. It is shown in Wang et al. 2024 that a PAge-like unified dark fluid (PUDF) can explain both the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and late-universe data, with the fitting quality not much worse than the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\\Lambda$CDM) model. Using the Planck 2018 CMB, baryon acoustic oscillations measurement from the dark energy spectroscopic instrument (DESI) data release 2, dark energy survey 5-year supernova data, and cosmic-chronometer data, we update the constraints on PUDF and clarify its physical implications. We show that PUDF can reproduce the primary CMB anisotropies, the background expansion history, and linear growth that are very close to the $\\Lambda$CDM prediction. Nevertheless, the combined datasets still favor $\\Lambda$CDM, largely due to the significant tension between CMB and DESI + SNe data, which exceeds the $4\\sigma$ level in PUDF and remains non-negligible in the $w$CDM framework. Using mock data generated from the Planck best-fit $\\Lambda$CDM model, we find that PUDF and $\\Lambda$CDM cannot be statistically distinguished, indicating that the precision of current data is insufficient to separate the two models. Overall, the apparent preference for $\\Lambda$CDM may be driven by dataset inconsistencies rather than a genuine physical difference, leaving unified dark fluid models as viable alternatives within current observational limits.",

We perform a non-parametric reconstruction of the vacuum energy ($w=-1$) interacting with cold dark matter using the cosmological data from DESI DR2, Planck CMB, and three SNIa samples (PP, DESY5, and Union3). By discretizing the coupling function $\\beta(z)$ into 20 redshift bins and assuming a Gaussian smoothness prior, we reconstruct $\\beta(z)$ without assuming any specific parameterization. The mean reconstructed $\\beta(z)$ changes sign during cosmic evolution, indicating an energy transfer from cold dark matter to dark energy at early times and a reverse flow at late times. At high redshifts, $\\beta(z)$ shows a $\\sim 2\\sigma$ deviation from $\\Lambda$CDM. At low redshifts, the results depend on the SNIa sample: CMB+DESI and CMB+DESI+PP yield $\\beta(z)$ consistent with zero within $2\\sigma$, while CMB+DESI+DESY5 and CMB+DESI+Union3 prefer negative $\\beta$ at $\\sim2\\sigma$. Both $\\chi^2$ tests and Bayesian analyses favor the $\\beta(z)$ model, with CMB+DESI DR2+DESY5 showing the most significant support through the largest improvement in goodness of fit ($\\Delta\\chi^2_{\\rm MAP}=-17.76$) and strongest Bayesian evidence ($\\ln\\mathcal{B} = 5.98 \\pm 0.69$). Principal component analysis reveals that the data effectively constrain three additional degrees of freedom in the $\\beta(z)$ model, accounting for most of the improvement in goodness of fit. Our results demonstrate that the dynamical dark energy preference in current data can be equally well explained by such a sign-reversal interacting dark energy, highlighting the need for future observations to break this degeneracy.",

Raw time series data available at this https URL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th) We investigate the neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from accretion disks formed during the failed collapse of a rotating massive star (a collapsar). Following black hole formation, a neutrino-cooled, shocked accretion disk forms, which displays non-spherical oscillations for a period of seconds before becoming advective and exploding the star. We compute the neutrino and GW signals (matter quadrupole, frequencies $\\lesssim 100$ Hz) from collapsar disks using global axisymmetric, viscous hydrodynamic simulations. The neutrino signal with typical energies of O$(10)$ MeV is maximal during the neutrino-cooled (NDAF) phase that follows shock formation. This phase lasts for a few seconds and is easily detectable within O$(10-100)$ kpc by the IceCube Neutrino Telescope. Additional neutrino signatures from a precursor equatorial shock and by stochastic accretion plumes during the advective phase are detectable within the galaxy. The GW signal during the NDAF phase is detectable in the galaxy by current and next-generation ground-based observatories. The explosion (memory) GW signal is similar to that of standard core-collapse supernovae and can be probed with a deci-Hertz space-based detector. Shock oscillations during the NDAF phase impart time variations with frequency O$(10-100)$ Hz to the neutrino and GW signals, encoding information about the shock dynamics and inner disk. These time variations can be detectable in neutrinos by IceCube within O$(1-10)$ kpc depending on progenitor model, flavor transformation scenario, and detailed properties of the angular momentum transport mechanism.",

Rev. D; open data on Zenodo High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We present realistic eccentricity distributions for extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) forming via the two-body relaxation channel in nuclear star clusters, tracking their evolution up to the final plunge onto the central Schwarzschild massive black hole (MBH). We find that EMRIs can retain significant eccentricities at plunge, with a distribution peaking at $e_\\mathrm{pl} \\approx0.2$, and a considerable fraction reaching much higher values. In particular, up to $20\\%$ of the forming EMRIs feature $e_\\mathrm{pl} > 0.5$ for central MBH masses $M_\\bullet$ in the range $10^5 \\mathrm{M_\\odot} \\leq M_\\bullet \\leq 10^6 \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$, partially due to EMRIs forming at large semi-major axes and \"cliffhanger EMRI\", usually neglected in literature. This highlights the importance of accounting for eccentricity in waveform modeling and detection strategies for future space-based gravitational wave observatories such as the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Furthermore, we find that the numerical fluxes in energy and angular momentum currently implemented in the FastEMRIWaveforms (FEW) package may not adequately sample the full parameter space relevant to low-mass MBHs ($M_\\bullet < 10^6 \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$), potentially limiting its predictive power in that regime. Specifically, for $M_\\bullet=10^5 \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ we find that about $75\\%$ ($50 \\%$) of EMRIs at 2 years (6 months) from plunge fall outside the currently available flux parameter space. Our findings motivate the development of extended flux grids and improved interpolation schemes to enable accurate modeling of EMRIs across a broader range of system parameters.",

Barker 9 pages, 1 figure (+1 figure in appendix) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Gravitational-wave detectors can probe the existence of dark matter with exquisite sensitivity. Here, we perform a search for three kinds of dark matter -- dilatons (spin-0), dark photons (spin-1) and tensor bosons (spin-2) -- using three independent methods on the first part of the most recent data from the fourth observing run of LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA. Each form of dark matter could have interacted with different standard-model particles in the instruments, causing unique differential strains on the interferometers. While we do not find any evidence for a signal, we place the most stringent upper limits to-date on each of these models. For scalars with masses between $[4\\times 10^{-14},1.5\\times 10^{-13}]$ eV that couple to photons or electrons, our constraints improve upon those from the third observing run by one order of magnitude, with the tightest limit of $\\sim 10^{-20}\\,\\text{GeV}^{-1}$ at a mass of $\\sim2\\times 10^{-13}\\text{ eV}$. For vectors with masses between $[7\\times 10^{-13},8.47\\times 10^{-12}]$ eV that couple to baryons, our constraints supersede those from MICROSCOPE and Eöt-Wash by one to two orders of magnitude, reaching a minimum of $\\sim 5\\times 10^{-24}$ at a mass of $\\sim 10^{-12}$ eV. For tensors with masses of $[4\\times 10^{-14},8.47\\times 10^{-12}]$ eV (the full mass range analyzed) that couple via a Yukawa interaction, our constraints surpass those from fifth-force experiments by four to five orders of magnitude, achieving a limit as low as $\\sim 8\\times 10^{-9}$ at $\\sim2\\times 10^{-13}$ eV. Our results show that gravitational-wave interferometers have become frontiers for new physics and laboratories for direct multi-model dark-matter detection.",

We are retracting this version pending a more thorough investigation High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The space-borne gravitational wave detectors such as TianQin offers a new window to test General Relativity by observing the early inspiral phase of stellar-mass binary black holes. A key concern arises if these stellar-mass binary black holes reside in gaseous environments such as active galactic nucleus accretion disks, where environmental effects imprint detectable modulations on the gravita- tional waveform. Using Bayesian inference on simulated signals containing both environmental and dipole deviation, we have assessed the extent to which the presence of environmental effects affects the detectability of dipole radiation. Our results demonstrate that even in the presence of strong environmental coupling, the dipole parameter can be recovered with high precision, and the evidence for dipole radiation remains distinguishable. Crucially, we find that the existence of environmental effects does not fundamentally impede the identification of dipole radiation, provided both effects are simultaneously modelled in the inference process. This study establishes that future tests of modified gravity with space-borne observatories can remain robust even for sources in astrophysical environments.",

Comments are welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an) Estimating the auto power spectrum of cosmological tracers from line-intensity mapping (LIM) data is often limited by instrumental noise, residual foregrounds, and systematics. Cross-power spectra between multiple lines offer a robust alternative, mitigating noise bias and systematics. However, inferring the auto spectrum from cross-correlations relies on two key assumptions: that all tracers are linearly biased with respect to the matter density field, and that they are strongly mutually correlated. In this work, we introduce a new diagnostic statistic, \\(\\mathcal{Q}\\), which serves as a data-driven null test of these assumptions. Constructed from combinations of cross-spectra between four distinct spectral lines, \\(\\mathcal{Q}\\) identifies regimes where cross-spectrum-based auto-spectrum reconstruction is unbiased. We validate its behavior using both analytic toy models and simulations of LIM observables, including star formation lines ([CII], [NII], [CI],[OIII]) and the 21-cm signal. We explore a range of redshifts and instrumental configurations, incorporating noise from representative surveys. Our results demonstrate that the criterion \\( \\mathcal{Q} \\approx 1 \\) reliably selects the modes where cross-spectrum estimators are valid, while significant deviations are an indicator that the key assumptions have been violated. The \\( \\mathcal{Q} \\) diagnostic thus provides a simple yet powerful data-driven consistency check for multi-tracer LIM analyses.",

When such a potential is present, a 3-form field may exhibit either quintessence-like or phantom-like behaviour. In this paper, we consider a 3-form model with a Gaussian potential, which features stable, ghost-free phantom-like behaviour within its convergence region and leads to an LSBR late-time attractor. We constrain this model observationally by performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis employing a comprehensive cosmological dataset, including Planck PR4 cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae data, low-$z$ Cepheid calibrators, and DES Y1 large-scale structure observations. We demonstrate that the 3-form model successfully increases the predicted Hubble parameter of CMB and BAO data from $67.89\\pm0.36{\\rm km/s/Mpc}$ of $\\Lambda$CDM model to $68.29^{+0.56}_{-0.61}{\\rm km/s/Mpc}$ without fine-tuning of the model parameters, thus reducing the tension with the late-time observation. Furthermore, we verify the sub-dominance of the 3-form field perturbation via both analytical and numerical analyses. Thus, the 3-form field does serve as a promising candidate of phantom-like dark energy from both theoretical and observational points of view.",

Submitting to ApJ, comments welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The High-Latitude Time-Domain Survey (HLTDS) for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will discover thousands of high redshift Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) to make generation-defining cosmological constraints on dark energy. To construct the Roman SN Hubble diagram, a strategy to obtain redshifts must be determined. While the nominal HLTDS will use only the Roman prism, in this work we consider the utility of the Roman grism observations from overlap with the High-Latitude Wide-Area Survey for SNIa cosmology. We determine a galaxy grism redshift recovery rate by simulating dispersed grism images and measuring redshifts with the Grizli software, obtaining an $H$-band 50% redshift recovery at magnitude 20.61 and 90% recovery at magnitude 19.27. To estimate the total number of spectroscopic redshifts expected for Roman SN cosmology, we also consider a Roman prism SN redshift efficiency and a ground-based telescope redshift efficiency for host-galaxies. We apply these redshift efficiencies to SNIa catalog level simulations and predict that $\\sim$6800 SNe will have a SN or host spectroscopic redshift. Second, we evaluate the size of potential systematics related to modeling the grism redshift efficiency by considering the impact of additional dependencies on stellar mass and host galaxy color. We estimate the largest potential size of this systematic to be 0.0066$\\pm$0.002 and -0.0266$\\pm$0.007, roughly 42.9 and 49.6% of the statistical uncertainty for $w_0$ and $w_a$ respectively.

They have also proven to be an efficient alternative for generating accurate galaxy catalogs, offering a faster and less computationally expensive option compared to full hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we demonstrate that using only galaxy $3$D positions and radial velocities, we can train a graph neural network coupled to a moment neural network to obtain a robust machine learning based model capable of estimating the matter density parameters, $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$, with a precision of approximately 10%. The network is trained on ($25 h^{-1}$Mpc)$^3$ volumes of galaxy catalogs from L-Galaxies and can successfully extrapolate its predictions to other semi-analytic models (GAEA, SC-SAM, and Shark) and, more remarkably, to hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, and SWIFT-EAGLE). Our results show that the network is robust to variations in astrophysical and subgrid physics, cosmological and astrophysical parameters, and the different halo-profile treatments used across simulations. This suggests that the physical relationships encoded in the phase-space of semi-analytic models are largely independent of their specific physical prescriptions, reinforcing their potential as tools for the generation of realistic mock catalogs for cosmological parameter inference.",

The core of our method introduces a two-step reweighting scheme: first, gravitational wave parameter estimation is performed under a uniform sky prior; the resulting posterior is then used to reweight galaxy positions within the Euclid catalog, constructing an astrophysically informed positional prior. Comparing this Euclid-informed prior against a uniform prior within our framework reveals distinct behaviors. While the posterior estimates of the intrinsic waveform parameters show little sensitivity to the prior change, the Bayes factor for lensing identification exhibits significant prior dependence. Crucially, for truly lensed event pairs, the Bayes factor systematically increases, whereas for unlensed pairs it decreases. This dual effect is vital for robust discrimination. Our analysis demonstrates that this multi-messenger approach significantly improves the confidence of lensing searches. For lensed pairs, the method boosts the Bayes factor by an average factor of $\\sim 10$, while effectively suppressing false positives for unlensed coincidences. This underscores the critical importance of prior specification and showcases the substantial gains achievable by synergizing gravitational-wave data with electromagnetic survey information.",

Inflationary models make predictions for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and the spectral index $n_s$ of initial density fluctuations. In light of relevant data releases this year, we present constraints on these two parameters using the latest cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation data (BAO) available. Using data from Planck, the South Pole Telescope, Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and BICEP/Keck experiments, we derive $n_s=0.9682\\,\\pm\\,0.0032$ and a 95% upper limit of $r<0.034$. This upper limit on $r$ is consistent with the official BICEP/Keck result given the numerical precision of the analyses and our choice to impose the self-consistency relation for single field slow-roll inflation on the tensor power spectrum; the $r$ constraint is not impacted by the additional CMB data. While adding DESI BAO data to the CMB data has a negligible impact on $r$, the $n_s$ constraint shifts upward to $0.9728\\,\\pm\\,0.0029$, which favours monomial inflaton potentials with $N_\\star\\sim 50$ over Starobinsky $R^2$ or Higgs inflation with $N_\\star = 51$ and $N_\\star = 55$, respectively. This shift is caused by marginally significant differences between the CMB and DESI data that remain unexplained in the context of the standard model. We show that a class of polynomial $\\alpha$-attractor models can predict the CMB and CMB+DESI $n_s$ results with $N_\\star=47.1$ and $N_\\star=55.1$, respectively. While future data will improve our sensitivity to $r$, robust $n_s$ constraints are just as crucial to differentiate between inflation models.

For that, instead of choosing a specific model for the matter power spectrum, the main ingredient of these probes, we express it by parametrizing its components, such as the expansion and the growth factor, and those of the standard halo model and excursion set theory in several z bins, besides to the different bias and non-linear bias modelling functions. We apply the technique to Euclid, Rubin and SKA public specifications in the range 0.2 < z < 1.8 and show that one can then obtain model-independent constraints of the expansion E(z i ) and the growth factor G(z i ). We also show the change in gain in precision at each z- shell when going from pessimistic cut at linear scales to more optimistic non-linear settings, or the difference between using each survey alone or a combination of all of them, or the impact from fixing or adding more degrees of freedom in the non-linear modeling. We found that, in the most agnostic case, one can still reach high precision on E(z i ) in the order of the percent level when combining the three surveys at once while the growth factor G(z i ) has for the same settings one order of magnitude weaker constraints. We also found for both factors, an improvement that can reach one order of magnitude in precision when passing from linear to non-linear scales. We conclude that we will be able to constrain the two important factors of the background evolution and structure formation of the Universe when using non linear scales and the combined power of future surveys even in the most agnostic approaches.",

However, the Bayes factor, a key metric for model comparison, remains inconclusive on which model is preferred. This paper applies the BF method, that integrates both Bayesian and frequentist approaches to DESI data to address the limitations of purely frequentist or Bayesian methods. It consists in considering the Bayes factor as a random variable and calculates its distribution, that results from values computed in a frequentist approach after perturbing the data following the model considered. We apply this hybrid method to DESI data, comparing the CPL and w models under various prior conditions, including weak and strong priors, and theory-informed priors. We find that, when the traditional bayes factor is considered, that weak priors favor the w model over CPL, while strong priors favor CPL. Additionally, theory-informed priors further enhance the preference for the w model. While when we apply the BF method, the preference for CPL over w is seen in all cases albeit with similar but reduced impact on the p-value from the different prior considerations. We also tried to generalize further, by perturbing as well the covariance matrix following the model considered, and found that, in general, the current data in that case is not stringent enough to disentangle between the two models. Our results demonstrate that varying the Bayes factor as a random variable, providing that the covariance matrix is kept as model independent, provides a robust model comparison, reducing the impact of prior dependence as well as offering quantitative assessment of the preferences of the competing models.(abridged)",

      "abstract": "On the validity of the continuity equation in a modified gravity framework with CMB, DES 3x2pt and tomographic ISW data Ziad Sakr, Miguel Quartin Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) In this work we propose a phenomenological modification to the continuity equation at the linear perturbation level and test it using combinations of the CMB temperature, polarization and lensing potential angular spectrum, the ISW-galaxy cross power spectrum and the 3$\\times$2pt lensing and galaxy clustering from DES survey. We investigate two parametrisations of this modification, both proportional to a new parameter $A_c$, which is assumed to be either constant in time, or proportional to the scale factor $a$, in order to be more relevant at late times. We find DES and ISW data to be consistent with the standard continuity equation when $A_c$ is constant, but 2--3$\\sigma$ hints of a non-zero modification appear when Planck data is included. The model $A_c \\propto a$ results in stronger tensions. We also test the effects of including the common extra parameters $\\mu$ and $\\eta$ that modify the Poisson equation and Weyl potential. Although $A_c$, $\\mu$ and $\\eta$ are correlated, we still find non-zero $A_c$ when Planck data is included or without Planck if $A_c \\propto a$ and only either $\\eta$ or $\\mu$ are allowed to vary. We conclude that violations of the continuity equation should be considered with care when testing additional deviations from general relativity.",

This result indicates a stronger scale invariance of the scalar perturbation than earlier estimates, posing challenges for numerous inflation models. In this work, we propose an appealing inflationary scenario from the Weyl scale-invariant gravity theory dominated by the higher-order curvatures. Specifically, the exponential curvature extensions are introduced to suppress the mass divergence of the inflaton. We find such scenario naturally yields leading-order predictions of $n_s\\simeq1-3/(2N)\\sim0.97-0.975$ or $n_s\\simeq1-5/(3N)\\sim0.967-0.972$ for various models, in excellent agreement with the ACT/SPT constraints.

By combining CMB intensity and polarization measurements from the $\\it{Planck}$ satellite with spectroscopic member-galaxy redshifts from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in a sample of 25 X-ray cross-matched, low-redshift ($0.02< z< 0.09)$, massive ($10^{13.9}\\lesssim M_{\\rm 500c}/M_\\odot \\lesssim 10^{14.6}$) galaxy clusters, we detect a dipolar rkSZ signature aligned with the estimated rotation direction of each cluster, ruling out a chance fluctuation at 99.98% confidence (3.6$\\sigma$). The significance of this measurement is enhanced by several new methodological improvements for isolating the rkSZ signal from primary CMB fluctuations and noise. The amplitude and shape of the signal are qualitatively consistent with predictions from state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations. These results establish a new tool with which to probe the dynamical state of galaxy clusters using CMB data.",

Analyzing the full field of view spectrum in the $1.7-12.0$ keV band, we find evidence for two-temperature cluster gas. The hotter ($kT = 5.53 \\pm 0.13$ keV) gas has a velocity dispersion of $261 \\pm 13$ km s$^{-1}$ and a bulk velocity of $120 \\pm 20$ km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the central galaxy. The cooler gas ($kT = 2.0^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ keV) has an even broader velocity dispersion of $440 \\pm 130$ km s$^{-1}$, with a systematic uncertainty of $120$ km s$^{-1}$. The relative line-of-sight velocity between the hotter and cooler gas can be as high as $450 \\pm 140$ km s$^{-1}$. We interpret the high velocity dispersions as a combination of turbulence and bulk motion due to the cocoon shock. The upper limit on the non-thermal pressure fraction for the hotter gas is $7.7 \\pm 0.7\\%$. We associate the cooler gas with the central region ($<35$ kpc) and the hotter phase with the gas surrounding it ($35-100$ kpc). The total energy due to the kinetic motion is $5.1 \\times 10^{60}$ erg, consistent with the energy associated with the central radio source. The kinetic energy injection rate is $6.9 \\times 10^{44}-7.4 \\times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ under varying assumptions of injection timescales.

We use the posterior approximation via Morph as the importance distribution in optimal bridge sampling. We denote this procedure by MorphZ, which serves as a post-processing estimator of the marginal likelihood. The MorphZ estimator requires only posterior samples together with the prior and likelihood, and is fully agnostic to the choice of sampler. We evaluate MorphZ's performance across statistical benchmarks, pulsar timing array (PTA) models, compact binary coalescence (CBC) gravitational-wave (GW) simulations and the GW150914 event. Across these applications, spanning low to high dimensionalities, MorphZ yields accurate evidence at substantially reduced computational cost relative to standard approaches, and can improve these estimates even when posterior coverage is incomplete. Its bridge sampling relative error diagnostic provides conservative uncertainty estimates. Because MorphZ operates directly on posterior draws, it complements exploration-oriented samplers by enabling fast and reliable evidence estimation, while it can be seamlessly integrated into existing inference workflows.",

A&A submitted Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Gravitationally lensed quasars are viable cosmic tools for constraining a diversity of fundamental astrophysical phenomena; They enable identification of faint, low-mass supermassive black holes, provide unique constraints on the intervening intergalactic or interstellar medium in their sightlines, and can be used to determine key cosmological quantities such as the Hubble constant, $H_0$. However, they are rare phenomena, and it has proven difficult to define efficient, unbiased selection methods.} In this study, we report the spectroscopic identification of a remarkable triple-lensed quasar system at $z=2.67$, identified based on its astrometric measurements from the {\\em Gaia} mission, as well as a larger spectroscopic follow-up survey of {\\em Gaia}-detected candidate lensed quasars. We characterize in detail the three mirror images of the quasar and their spatial and temporal spectroscopic coverage, with focus on the emission-line properties which shows variation across sigthlines and temporal evolution over the $\\sim 11$months spectroscopic campaign. We construct a lens model of the foreground source from a combination of the multiple spectra and deep optical imaging, providing a robust halo mass of $M_{\\rm h} = (2.78 \\pm 0.05)\\times 10^{10}M_\\odot$. Based on the lens model, the time delay between each sightline is translated into an intrinsic quasar time, allowing us to construct a quasar timeseries over $\\sim18$months with monthly cadence. Over months timescales the broad emission lines vary in both velocity offset and equivalent width (EW) as well as an overall increase in ionization. This exemplary triple-lensed quasars demonstrates the viability of identifying such rare lens configurations based purely on the astrometric measurements from the {\\em Gaia} mission, which we here provide optimized selection criteria for, for future studies.",

A typical wave dark matter halo exhibits granular substructures due to wave interference. In this paper, we explore the wave interference effects around caustics. These are locations of formally divergent density in cold collisionless systems. Examples include splashback in galaxy clusters, and tidal shells in merging galaxies, where the pile-up of dark matter close to apogee gives rise to caustics. We show that wave interference modifies the density profile in the vicinity of the caustics, giving rise to a fringe pattern well-described by the Airy function. This follows from approximating the gravitational potential as linear close to apogee. This prediction is verified in a series of numerical simulations in which the gravitational potential is computed exactly. We provide a formula expressing the fringe separation in terms of the wave dark matter mass and halo parameters, which is useful for interpreting and stacking data. The fringe separation near caustics can be significantly larger than the naive de Broglie scale (the latter set by the system's velocity dispersion). This opens up the possibility of detecting caustic fringes for a wide range of wave dark matter masses.",

The extended AP test method uses the full shape of redshift-space two-point correlation funcion(CF) as the standard shape in order to measure the expansion history of the universe. We calibrate the standard shape by using the cosmology-dependent nonlinear evolution of the CF shape in the Multiverse simulations. Further validation of the method and calibration of possible systematics are performed based on mock samples from the Horizon Run 4 simulation. Using the AP test alone, we constrain the flat CDM plus CPL-type dark energy model (flat $w^{\\rm CPL}$CDM) to have $\\Omega_m=0.290_{-0.031}^{+0.029}$, $w_0=-0.800_{-0.100}^{+0.208}$, and $w_a=-0.238_{-0.972}^{+0.650}$.

The best-fit $w^{CPL}(z)$ suggests no phantom-divide crossing at $z<0.7$, and the dark energy behaviour is consistent with a thawing quintessence field. It is only when the CMB data are combined with late-time cosmological probes that a phantom-divide crossing at low redshift is favored.",

To appear in the A&A Special Issue `Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1)', 22 pages, 22 figures Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) This paper describes the VIS Processing Function (VIS PF) of the Euclid ground segment pipeline, which processes and calibrates raw data from the VIS camera. We present the algorithms used in each processing element, along with a description of the on-orbit performance of VIS PF, based on Performance Verification (PV) and Q1 data. We demonstrate that the principal performance metrics (image quality, astrometric accuracy, photometric calibration) are within pre-launch specifications. The image-to-image photometric scatter is less than $0.8\\%$, and absolute astrometric accuracy compared to Gaia is $5$ mas Image quality is stable over all Q1 images with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $0.\\!^{\\prime\\prime}16$. The stacked images (combining four nominal and two short exposures) reach $I_\\mathrm{E} = 25.6$ ($10\\sigma$, measured as the variance of $1.\\!^{\\prime\\prime}3$ diameter apertures). We also describe quality control metrics provided with each image, and an appendix provides a detailed description of the provided data products. The excellent quality of these images demonstrates the immense potential of Euclid VIS data for weak lensing. VIS data, covering most of the extragalactic sky, will provide a lasting high-resolution atlas of the Universe.",

Comments welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) When a moving gravitational-wave (GW) source travels behind a massive astrophysical object, its signal is gravitationally lensed, showing a waveform distortion similar to a Paczyński curve. We present a first study of the lensing signature of a massive black hole (MBH) on a frequency-dependent GW signal from a moving binary merger. For both light and GW sources in a Keplerian circular orbit around a MBH lens, the self-lensing geometry breaks the microlensing degeneracy in the Einstein radius crossing timescale $t_{\\rm E}$. The duration of the curve ($2 t_{\\rm E}$) becomes independent on the MBH mass $M_{\\rm MBH}$, and provides a direct measure of the distance $d_{\\rm LS}$ to the MBH. However, $M_{\\rm MBH}$ remains unknown. We show that, in GW signals, the redshifted mass $M_{{\\rm MBH},z}$ can additionally be obtained from the interference pattern, by measuring the modulation period $T$, the GW frequency $f$, and $t_{\\rm E}$: $M_{{\\rm MBH},z}\\simeq 2.5\\times 10^6\\,M_\\odot\\,(t_{\\rm E}/[100\\,{\\rm s}])\\,(f\\,T)^{-1}$. If this lensing signature is not considered, it may be confused with other waveform distortions, especially in the modeling of overlapping signals in next generation ground-based GW detectors. The observation of one of these curves and its associated parameters may help (1) constrain the orbital distance $d_{\\rm LS}$ of sources, especially around low-mass MBHs at the center of star clusters and galaxies, (2) additionally estimate the mass $M_{{\\rm MBH},z}$ of these MBHs, and (3) infer the orbital inclination of the binary. Simultaneously obtaining $d_{\\rm LS}$ and $M_{{\\rm MBH},z}$ through self-lensing can help constrain the astrophysical environments where GW signals come from.",

In the present study, we investigate formation of the circumstellar matter (CSM) in double white-dwarf (WD) mergers. We further study the interaction between the CSM and the SN ejecta. We first model the orbital evolution and super-Eddington mass transfer/ejection in the double WD systems. We then conduct hydrodynamical and light-curve (LC) simulations of the SN-CSM interaction, assuming a prompt SN Ia explosion in a context of the carbon-ignited violent merger (C-ignited VM). Our simulations show that at the moment of the merger, the binary system has the CSM distribution following $\\rho_{\\mathrm{CSM}}\\simeq D(r/10^{14}\\ \\mathrm{cm})^{-3.5}\\ (D\\simeq 10^{-14}\\text{--}10^{-13}\\ \\rm g\\ cm^{-3})$. The simulated LCs reproduce the early flux excesses across optical to UV bands, as well as their color evolution, observed in the VM candidates, i.e., 03fg/02es-like SNe Ia. This supports that 03fg/02es-like objects originate from the VM explosions. We also discuss the case of the helium-ignited VM, which might be realized in some WD-WD mergers depending on the He content in the system. Focused here is the timing when the explosion is initiated, and we find that the explosion is initiated after the companion WD is, at least partially, tidally disrupted also in this case; we thus expect the formation of the CSM through the mass transfer phase also for the helium-ignited VM scenario.",

Data presented in this submission is included in machine-readable format as 2 ancillary files. Accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Our survey of the fourth $\\mathit{Fermi}$ Large Area Telescope catalog (4FGL) unassociated gamma-ray source regions using the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) and Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) aboard the Neil Gehrels $\\mathit{Swift}$ Observatory ($\\mathit{Swift}$) provides new XRT and UVOT source detections and localizations to help identify potential low-energy counterparts to unassociated $\\mathit{Fermi}$ gamma-ray sources. We present a catalog of 218 singlet and 70 multiplet $\\mathit{Swift}$ X-ray sources detected within the positional uncertainty ellipses of 244 unassociated $\\mathit{Fermi}$ gamma-ray sources from the 4FGL-DR4 catalog, 144 of which are not previously cataloged by Kerby et al. (2021b). For each X-ray source, we derive its X-ray flux and photon index, then use simultaneous UVOT observations with optical survey data to estimate its $V$-band magnitude. We use these parameters as inputs for a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network classifier (NNC) trained to classify sources as blazars, pulsars, or ambiguous gamma-ray sources. For the 213 singlet sources with X-ray and optical data, we classify 173 as likely blazars ($P_\\mathrm{bzr} > 0.99$) and 6 as likely pulsars ($P_\\mathrm{bzr} < 0.01$), with 34 sources yielding ambiguous results. Including 70 multiplet X-ray sources, we increase the number of $P_\\mathrm{bzr} > 0.99$ to 227 and $P_\\mathrm{bzr} < 0.01$ to 16. For the subset of these classifications that have been previously studied, a large majority agree with prior classifications, supporting the validity of using this NNC to classify the unknown and newly detected gamma-ray sources.",

Verrico 20 pages, 7 figures, pending submission to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present FEADME (Fast Elliptical Accretion Disk Modeling Engine), a GPU-accelerated Python framework for modeling broad Balmer-line emission using a relativistic elliptical accretion-disk formalism. Leveraging Jax and NumPyro for differentiable forward modeling and efficient Bayesian inference, FEADME enables large-sample, reproducible analyses of disk-dominated emission-line profiles. We apply the framework to 237 double-peaked emitters (DPEs) from the literature and to five tidal disruption events (TDEs) with disk-like H$\\alpha$ emission, fitting three physically motivated model families per spectrum and selecting the preferred model using approximate leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation. We find that AGN exhibit a broad, continuous distribution of disk geometries and kinematics, with significant diversity in disk parameters. Most TDE disk parameter distributions are statistically indistinguishable from those of the AGN, with the sole robust difference being that TDE disks are significantly more circular, consistent with rapid debris circularization in tidal disruption events. The majority of both AGN and TDEs favor models that include both a disk and an additional broad-line component, suggesting that disk emission commonly coexists with more isotropic or wind-driven gas. These results indicate that once a line-emitting disk forms, its spectroscopic appearance is governed by similar physical processes in both persistent AGN and transient TDE accretion flows, and they demonstrate the utility of FEADME for population-level studies of disk structure in galactic nuclei.",

EP250827b possesses a prompt X-ray luminosity of $\\sim 10^{45} \\, \\rm{erg \\, s^{-1}}$, lasts over 1000 seconds, and has a peak energy $E_{\\rm{p}} < 1.5$ keV at 90% confidence. SN 2025wkm possesses a double-peaked light curve (LC), though its bolometric luminosity plateaus after its initial peak for $\\sim 20$ days, giving evidence that a central engine is injecting additional energy into the explosion. Its spectrum transitions from a blue to red continuum with clear blueshifted Fe II and Si II broad absorption features, allowing for a SN Ic-BL classification. We do not detect any transient radio emission and rule out the existence of an on-axis, energetic jet $\\gtrsim 10^{50}~$erg. In the model we invoke, the collapse gives rise to a long-lived magnetar, potentially surrounded by an accretion disk. Magnetically-driven winds from the magnetar and the disk mix together, and break out with a velocity $\\sim 0.35c$ from an extended circumstellar medium with radius $\\sim 10^{13}$ cm, generating X-ray breakout emission through free-free processes. The disk outflows and magnetar winds power blackbody emission as they cool, producing the first peak in the SN LC. The spin-down luminosity of the magnetar in combination with the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni produces the late-time SN LC. We end by discussing the landscape of XRF-SNe within the context of EP's recent discoveries.",

Lin, Shotaro Yamasaki, Tomotsugu Goto, Tetsuya Hashimoto 9 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables; submitted to PASP High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio pulses with largely unknown origins, with a subset exhibiting repeating behavior. Magnetars highly magnetized neutron stars and a leading progenitor candidate for FRBs also produce similar but much fainter millisecond radio pulses, suggesting a possible connection between the two phenomena. The irregularity of the time series of repeating FRBs and magnetar pulses may provide insight into the underlying progenitor activity. In this study, we analyze time-series data from three repeating FRB sources (four datasets) and the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 to investigate potential patterns in burst arrival times, energy fluctuations, and peak-frequency shifts. We quantify the degree of randomness (Pincus Index; PI) and chaos (Largest Lyapunov Exponent; LLE) for these three parameters. We find that waiting times across all repeating FRBs exhibit high PI (high randomness) and low LLE (low chaos), consistent with the behavior of magnetar radio pulses. This similarity suggests that both may share a common triggering mechanism. In contrast, the energy fluctuations of both repeating FRBs and magnetar pulses occupy the same region in PI-LLE phase space but display much larger scatter than the other two domains. We discuss the possibility that beaming effects or strong variability in radio-emission efficiency may explain their distinct behavior in the energy domain.",

      "abstract": "Relaxation of time-variable neutron-loaded relativistic jets across the photosphere and their GeV-TeV neutrino counterparts Kanako Nakama, Kazumi Kashiyama, Nobuhiro Shimizu High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Both observational and theoretical studies indicate that the central engine of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) is intrinsically time-variable, implying jet inhomogeneity. A jet with an inhomogeneous Lorentz factor distribution develops internal shocks both below and above the photosphere, relaxing toward homologous expansion. Below the photosphere, neutrons, whose mean free paths are much longer than those of charged particles, play an essential role in the dissipation process. Using neutron-inclusive shell simulations with initial conditions based on the collapsar scenario, we link the statistical inhomogeneity of the jet at the breakout of the progenitor to the dissipation that occurs inside and outside the photosphere, and calculate the GeV-TeV neutrino counterpart originated from inelastic neutron-proton interactions consistently with the prompt gamma-ray emission. We find that the peak energy of the GeV-TeV neutrinos is in 10-30 GeV irrespective to the baryon loading factor of the jet, with the high-energy tail extending into the TeV range as the amplitude of the time variability becomes stronger. When gamma-ray emission is efficient as in typical GRBs (i.e., the gamma-ray radiation efficiency with respect to the total jet power is approximately 100%, the radiative efficiency of GeV-TeV neutrinos remains 0.1-10%. By contrast, when the gamma-ray radiation efficiency is relatively low (< 10%) for jets where a large fraction of the energy is dissipated below the photosphere, the neutrino efficiency can increase up to 20%. This suggests that GRBs with relatively low gamma-ray luminosities, as well as X-ray-rich transients, can be promising targets for ongoing and future GeV-TeV neutrino transient searches.",

Young 15 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables, accepted by MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Fairall 9 is among the most massive Seyfert galaxies exhibiting a strong soft X-ray excess, but it is challenging to probe soft X-ray reverberation lags (if any) due to the long intrinsic timescales expected from its large black hole mass of $\\sim 2.55 \\times 10^8 M_\\odot$. We fit five XMM-Newton spectra of Fairall 9 using the hybrid reXcor model taking into account both hot and warm corona. The soft excess is explained by a combination of a physically motivated warm corona and the disc reflection. Then, we perform a wavelet coherence analysis of the light curves between 0.3 - 1 and 1 - 4 keV bands. The spectral fits are consistent with a rapidly spinning black hole ($a = 0.99$), a warm corona with optical depth $\\sim$10 - 30, and a hot lamp-post corona located at either 5 or $20~r_{\\rm g}$. This configuration supports a coexisting hot and warm corona scenario, allowing the disc to extend almost to the event horizon. Our wavelet analysis on combined observations reveals signatures of transient soft X-ray lags, confined to specific time-frequency intervals. The earlier observations exhibit more variable and transient lag behavior. In contrast, the later observations display more persistent soft X-ray lags at the frequencies of $\\sim 9\\times 10^{-6}$ - $2.5 \\times 10^{-5}$ Hz, with amplitudes reaching $\\sim$1000 s. The results indicate a progressively stable disc-corona configuration in later observations. Given the mass and geometry of Fairall 9, the observed soft lags appears plausibly consistent in both size and timescales with expectations from X-ray reverberation.",

Venkatraman Krishnan 18 pages, 12 figures, Accepted for publication in MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The double pulsar system PSR~J0737$-$3039A/B has enabled some of the most precise tests of strong-field gravity to date. Here, we present a scintillation analysis of the system based on an 18-month observation campaign with the MeerKAT radio telescope. We characterise this interference pattern to infer properties of scattering plasma and the orbital geometry of the system. Our preferred model supports a scattering screen located at a distance of $D_s = 360^{+30}_{-40}$ pc. This moderately anisotropic screen of ionized gas (axial ratio $A_R = 2.4 \\pm 0.2$) lies near the edge of the Gum Nebula, which is believed to be a supernova remnant (SNR) or an \\HII\\, region. We estimate the expansion velocity of the nebula to be $V_{\\textrm{s}} = 35 \\pm 5$ km s$^{-1}$, implying a SNR age of $t \\approx 1$ Myr. We also constrain the orbital orientation and inclination sense of the double pulsar to be $\\Omega = 40^{\\circ} \\pm 3^{\\circ}$ and $i > 90^{\\circ}$, respectively. Assuming standard scattering geometry, our model yields a distance estimate consistent with the parallax-derived value of $D = 770 \\pm 70$ pc from very long baseline interferometry.

Graham, Lang Cui Accepted to Monthly Notices of Royal Astronomical Society, 21 pages, 12 figures High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We present various time series analysis methods to analyze multiple-sector observations of bright AGN from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and examine whether issues such as gaps and noise in these data can be mitigated. We determine variability timescales and search for quasi-periodicity using these methods and assess any differences. In this paper, we present an analysis of the $\\approx$300-day TESS observation of a blazar 3C 371 using power spectrum density, structure-function, and weighted wavelet Z-transform approaches. To reduce the effect of gaps and noise, Continuous auto-regressive moving averages, Bartlett periodogram, and wavelet decomposition methods are used. We have also used recurrence analysis to account for the nonlinearity present in the data and to quantify variability or periodicity as the recurrent state. Considering the entirety of the TESS observations, we derive the variability timescale to be around 4.5 days. Sector-wise analysis found variability timescales in the range of 3.0--7.0 days, values that are found to be consistent using different methods. When analyzing multiple sectors together, significant variability, which could be quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), of duration 3--6 days in individual segments, is detected. These may be attributed to the kink instabilities developed in the jet or the existence of mini-jets inside a jet undergoing precession. We find that these methods, when applied appropriately, can be used to study the variability in TESS data. The noise present in these TESS observations can be minimized using Bartlett's periodogram and wavelet decomposition to recover the real stochastic variability.",

Nevertheless, the origin of the measured luminosity peak at early times is still unknown, and the ultimate sources of energy dissipation in TDEs are not fully understood. Here we present the first three-dimensional end-to-end simulation of a TDE by a $10^{4}M_\\odot$ intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) with realistic parameters, run with the radiation-hydrodynamics code RICH. We find that the stellar debris fails to circularize efficiently, while a low-density, radiation-driven wind forms near pericenter and expands quasi-spherically. Radiation is advected by this outflow and released at the photosphere, which expands to radii of $\\approx10^{13}$ cm and reaches temperatures of ~few $10^{4}$K at the peak of the light curve. The resulting luminosity briefly exceeds the Eddington limit before settling near that value. We systematically test the numerical convergence of our simulation by running it at three resolutions. While the nozzle shock at pericenter may be under-resolved, we find that global results are qualitatively converged and, largely, quantitatively robust.

At the same time, it has become increasingly clear that progress in our physical understanding will only come from studying these sources in multiple dimensions simultaneously.

In this paper, we introduce the alpha release of nDspec, a new python-based library designed to allow users to model one- and multi-dimensional datasets common to X-ray astronomy. In the alpha release, we focus on modelling time-averaged data as well as Fourier spectral-timing mode, but highlight how additional dimensions can be added. We discuss design philosophy and current features, and showcase an example use case by characterizing a NICER observation of a black hole X-ray binary.

If the propeller stage duration allows neutron stars to begin accreting matter from the interstellar medium and if the efficiency of accretion is high, then the number of accreting isolated neutron stars in eROSITA data can reach ~a few thousand. Still, uncertainties in spin-down at the propeller stage and in the accretion process can drastically decrease this number.

D'Orazio, Jonathan Menu Submitted to the Open Journal of Astrophysics. 26 pages, 17 figures. Comments welcome! High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Upcoming space-based gravitational wave detectors such as LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, will be sensitive to extreme- and intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs and IMRIs). These binaries are comprised of a supermassive black hole and a stellar-mass object or intermediate-mass black hole. Their detection will probe the structure of galactic nuclei and enable tests of general relativity. As these events will be observed over thousands of orbital cycles, they will be extremely sensitive to both the underlying spacetime and astrophysical environment, demanding exquisite theoretical models on both fronts to avoid biased or even erroneous results. In particular, many (E/)IMRIs are expected to occur within accretion discs around supermassive black holes, and the nonlinearities present when modeling these systems require numerical simulations. In preparation for future modeling of LISA sources, we have conducted a comparison between eight different hydrodynamical codes and applied them to the problem of a q = 10^{-4} mass ratio binary interacting with an accretion disc. Thicker discs appear more lenient, and all codes at sufficiently high resolutions are in good agreement with each other and analytical predictions. For thinner discs, beyond the reach of analytical models, we find substantial disagreement between 2D and 3D simulations and between different codes, including both the magnitude and sign of the torque. With time and energy efficiency in mind, codes that leverage moving meshes or grid-based Lagrangian remapping seem preferable, as do codes that can leverage graphical processing units and other energy-efficient hardware.",

By formulating the geometric shape of the scattered wave spectrum in wave number space, where the velocity vector of the beam component and the wave vectors of the incident and scattered waves are arbitrary, it is demonstrated that the spectrum in 2D wave number space becomes asymmetric. The spectrum of scattered waves propagating in a specific direction is presented as a function of wavelength to show that the electron (ion) feature is amplified and becomes asymmetric or distorted when Buneman (ion acoustic) instability occurs. An additional simulation is conducted for a weak, linearly stable beam-plasma system with a hot beam, and confirmed that the obtained scattered wave spectrum shows asymmetric feature. The results are expected to be applicable to the interpretation of radar observations of ionospheric plasmas as well as CTS measurements in laboratory plasmas.",

Continuous light curves with high cadence and high photometric precision are now available for millions of sources within our galaxy and beyond. In addition to revolutionizing exoplanet science, the data have enabled breakthroughs ranging from the solar system to stellar interiors, the transient universe, and active galaxies. The key summary points of this review are: (1) Stellar astrophysics has been transformed by the ability to probe the internal structures of stars, test the physics of stellar convection, connect stellar rotation and magnetic activity, and reveal complex variability in young stars. (2) Ages of stellar populations probe the formation history of our Milky Way, and binary star variability enables the detection of \"dark\" galactic populations such as solar-mass black holes and neutron stars. (3) Early-time observations of explosive transients provide new insights into the progenitors of supernovae, while the quasi-periodic variability of galaxies probes the physics of accretion processes onto supermassive black holes and the tidal disruption of stars. (4) Observations of solar system objects reveal asteroid compositions through their rotation periods and amplitudes, constrain the cloud structure of ice giants, and allow the discovery of new objects in the outer solar system. (5) Open data policies and software have contributed to remarkable scientific productivity and enabled discoveries by citizen scientists, including new exoplanets and exotic variability in mature Sun-like stars.",

Gaches, Serena Viti Accepted by ACS Earth and Space Chemistry (Eric Herbst Festschrift) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) In the past decade, there has been a significant shift in astrochemistry with a renewed focus on the role of non-thermal processes on the molecular interstellar medium, in particular energetic particles (such as cosmic ray particles and fast electrons) and X-ray radiation. This has been brought about in large part due to new observations of interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMS) in environments that would inhibit their formation, such as cold, dense gas in prestellar cores or in the highly energetic environments in galactic centers. In parallel, there has been a plethora of new laboratory investigations on the role of high-energy radiation and electrons on the chemistry of astrophysical ices, demonstrating the ability of this radiation to induce complex chemistry. In recent years, theoretical models have also begun to include newer cosmic-ray-driven processes in both the gas and ice phases. In this review, we unify aspects of the chemistry driven by X-ray radiation and energetic particles into a ``high-energy astrochemistry'', defining this term and reviewing the underlying chemical processes. We conclude by examining various laboratories where high-energy astrochemistry is at play and identify future issues to be tackled.",

This article is accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Recent observations suggest that Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR; SN 1572) is expanding into a cavity wall of molecular clouds (MCs), which decelerate the SNR and influence its multi-wavelength morphology. To constrain the physical properties of environmental MCs and search for heated gas, we perform a JCMT $^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 observation and compare with previous $^{12}$CO $J$=2--1, $^{12}$CO $J$=1--0 and $^{13}$CO $J$=1--0 data. We present the $^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 map toward Tycho and show that the $^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 spatial distribution and line profiles are similar to those of the lower-$J$ CO lines. By comparing the multiple transitions of CO and the RADEX (Radiative transfer code in non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) models, we constrain the physical properties of molecular gas surrounding Tycho: the northern cloud has a molecular column density of $N({\\rm H}_{2})=0.5$ -- $4.5\\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, while other regions have $N({\\rm H}_{2})=0.2$ -- $3.9\\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$; the kinetic temperatures $T_{\\rm k}$ of these clouds are in the range of 9 -- 22 K and the volume densities $n({\\rm H}_{2})$ are 20 -- $700$ cm$^{-3}$. We also discuss the difficulty in finding hot molecular gas shocked by such a young SNR. We estimate that the shocked molecular layer can be as thin as 0.003 pc, corresponding to $0.2''$ at the distance of 2.5 kpc, which is 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the angular resolution of current CO observations. Therefore, our molecular observations are largely insensitive to the thin shocked gas layer; instead, they detect the environmental gas.",

Although originally conceived for the analysis of gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves (LCs), MEPSA can be readily applied to other transient phenomena. The algorithm scans the input data by applying a set of 39 predefined patterns across multiple timescales. While robust and effective, its computational cost becomes significant at large re-binning factors. To address this, FAST-MEPSA introduces a sparser offset-scanning strategy. In parallel, building on MEPSA's flexibility, we introduce a 40th pattern specifically designed to recover a class of elusive peaks that are typically sub-threshold and lie on the rising edge of broader structures - often missed by the original pattern set. Both versions of FAST-MEPSA - with 39 and 40 patterns - were validated on simulated GRB LCs. Compared to MEPSA, the new implementation achieves a speed-up of nearly a factor 400 at high re-binning factors, with only a minor (~4%) reduction in the number of detected peaks. It retains the same detection efficiency while significantly lowering the false positive rate of low significance. The inclusion of the new pattern increases the recovery of previously undetected and sub-threshold peaks. These improvements make FAST-MEPSA an effective tool for large-scale analyses where a robust trade-off between speed, efficiency, and reliability is essential. The adoption of 40 patterns instead of the classical 39 is advisable when an enhanced efficiency in detecting faint events is desired. The code is made publicly available.",

Rev. D High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We perform an extensive study of equation of state (EoS) models featuring a phase transition from hadronic to deconfined quark matter in neutron star merger simulations. We employ three different hadronic EoSs, a constant speed of sound parameterization for the quark phase and a Maxwell construction to generate a large sample of hybrid EoS models. We systematically vary the onset density and density jump of the phase transition as well as the quark matter stiffness and simulate binary neutron star mergers to infer how the properties of the phase transition affect the gravitational-wave signal. In total we simulate mergers with 245 different hybrid EoS models. In particular, we explore in which scenarios a phase transition would be detectable by a characteristically increased postmerger gravitational-wave frequency compared to an estimate from the inspiral signal assuming a purely hadronic EoS. We find that the density jump at the transition (latent heat) has the largest impact on the gravitational-wave frequencies, while the influence of the stiffness of quark matter is smaller. We quantify which range of phase transition properties would be compatible with a certain magnitude or absence of the gravitational-wave postmerger frequency shift. By means of these dependencies, a future detection will thus directly yield constraints on the allowed features of the hadron-quark phase transition.",

These systems, colloquially known as \"spiders,\" consist of neutron stars in tight orbits with low-mass companions, which are gradually ablated by the pulsar wind. SpiderCat includes both primary subclasses$-$redbacks and black widows$-$distinguished by companion mass, as well as candidates and peculiar systems such as transitional, huntsman and tidarren MSPs. As of this initial release, SpiderCat contains 111 entries: 30 redbacks, 50 black widows, two huntsmans, 23 redback candidates, five black widow candidates, and one huntsman candidate. In this paper, we compile and summarize key parameters for each system, including spin and orbital properties, and multiwavelength data from radio, optical, X-ray, and $\\gamma$-ray observations. An interactive, publicly accessible web interface, at this https URL, enables exploration and visualization of the data. The rapid growth of the number of known spiders, accelerated by the Fermi Large Area Telescope survey and its ability to identify MSPs in $\\gamma$-rays, has opened the door to population-level studies. Utilizing SpiderCat, we analyze trends in spin period, orbital period, companion mass, emission properties, and spatial distribution. SpiderCat serves as a dynamic, multiwavelength repository for this unique class of binary pulsars, facilitating new discoveries and constraints on pulsar evolution, particle acceleration, and the neutron star equation of state.",

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We report the milliarcsecond localization of a high (1379 pc/cc) dispersion measure (DM) repeating fast radio burst, FRB 20190417A. Combining European VLBI Network detections of five repeat bursts, we confirm the FRB's host to be a low-metallicity, star-forming dwarf galaxy at z = 0.12817, similar to the hosts of FRBs 20121102A, 20190520B and 20240114A. We also confirm that it is associated with a previously reported persistent radio source (PRS), which is compact on milliarcsecond scales. Visibility-domain model fitting constrains the transverse physical size of the PRS to < 23 pc and yields an integrated flux density of 191(39) microJy at 1.4 GHz. Though we do not find significant evidence for DM evolution, FRB 20190417A exhibits a time-variable rotation measure (RM) ranging between +3958(11) and +5061(24) rad/m2 over three years. We find no evidence for intervening galaxy clusters in the FRB's line-of-sight and place a conservative lower limit on the rest-frame host DM contribution of 1228 pc/cc (90% confidence) -- the largest known for any FRB so far. This system strengthens the emerging picture of a rare subclass of repeating FRBs with large and variable RMs, above-average host DMs, and luminous PRS counterparts in metal-poor dwarf galaxies. Our results suggest that these systems are the result of environmental selection, or a distinct engine for FRB emission.",

We address this with a one-dimensional convolutional neural network integrated with an Adaptive Frequency Feature Enhancement module and physics-informed data augmentation. Our framework generates 100,000 synthetic GRB samples, expanding training data diversity and volume while preserving physical fidelity-especially for low-significance events. The model achieves 97.46% classification accuracy, outperforming all tested variants with conventional enhancement modules, highlighting enhanced domain-specific feature capture. Feature visualization shows model focuses on deep-seated morphological features and confirms the capability of extracting physically meaningful burst characteristics. Dimensionality reduction and clustering reveal GRBs with similar morphologies or progenitor origins cluster in the feature space, linking learned features to physical properties. This perhaps offers a novel diagnostic tool for identifying kilonova- and supernova-associated GRB candidates, establishing criteria to enhance multi-messenger early-warning systems. The framework aids current time-domain surveys, generalizes to other rare transients, and advances automated detection in large-volume observational data.",

By modeling proton injection, the study explores how the acceleration of protons in massive star clusters contributes to the gamma radiation detectable from Earth. The analysis focuses on two primary types of clusters: widespread, dispersed clusters and younger, compact massive clusters, both of which host shock waves generated by supernova remnants (SNR). Clusters located near the solar system, within a 3-kiloparsec radius,are identified. Analytical methods are used to calculate energy spectra and gamma-ray production rates.

Published in Journal of Plasma Physics Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Cosmic-ray transport in turbulent astrophysical environments remains a multifaceted problem and, despite decades of study, the impact of complex magnetic field geometry -- evident in simulations and observations -- has only recently received more focussed attention. To understand how ensemble-averaged transport behaviour emerges from the intricate interactions between cosmic rays and structured magnetic turbulence, we run test-particle experiments in snapshots of a strongly turbulent magnetohydrodynamics simulation. We characterise particle--turbulence interactions via the gyro radii of particles and their experienced field-line curvatures, which reveals two distinct transport modes: magnetised motion, where particles are tightly bound to strong coherent flux tubes and undergo large-scale mirroring; and unmagnetised motion, characterised by chaotic scattering through weak and highly tangled regions of the magnetic field. We formulate an effective stochastic process for each mode: compound subdiffusion with long mean free paths for magnetised motion, and a Langevin process with short mean free paths for unmagnetised motion. A combined stochastic walker that alternates between these two modes accurately reproduces the mean squared displacements observed in the test-particle data. Our results emphasise the critical role of coherent magnetic structures in comprehensively understanding cosmic-ray transport and lay a foundation for developing a theory of geometry-mediated transport.",

Soler 22 pages, 25 figures, submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is an extreme star formation environment, characterized by higher density, higher turbulence, stronger orbital shear, and stronger magnetic field strength than the Solar neighborhood. Whether classical theories of star formation hold within this extreme environment is still debated. In order to assess the impact of these different conditions on the interstellar medium (ISM) and on star formation, we present radiation MHD arepo simulations of a Milky Way-type galaxy. We set up a high-resolution ($M_{\\rm cell}=20$ M$_\\odot$) region in a ring around the Solar radius, as well as in the barred region of the Galaxy to have a coherent comparison between the CMZ and the Solar neighborhood. Although the high densities and strong levels of turbulence influence star formation and feedback, we find that a key difference in the regulation of star formation between the two environments comes from the short orbital times and the strong shear present in the CMZ. In particular, we highlight the role of the quick dynamical decoupling of stars and gas that leads to periodic re-embedding events in the early lifetimes of radiating O stars. Young stellar associations get efficiently sheared apart such that the ISM is deprived of the compounding effect of radiation and supernovae in disrupting molecular clouds. This changes dramatically the evolution of giant molecular clouds and how feedback can regulate star formation in the CMZ. Stellar feedback is no longer directly coupled to the molecular cloud from which they formed and no strong and disruptive superbubbles can develop. Instead, the feedback rather acts as a background source of turbulence.",

We present an analysis of the integrated and spatially-resolved rest-frame optical emission line properties of the ionised gas in 43 star-forming galaxies at $z\\sim1.5$ in the KMOS Ultra-deep Rotational Velocity Survey (KURVS).

On $\\sim4$-kpc scales metallicity gradients measured from N$_2$O$_2$ and those measured from N$_2$ are in good agreement when considering the spatial distributions of dust in each galaxy, as parameterised by dust attenuation radial gradients. We report a nearly flat metallicity gradient distribution typically at $z\\sim1.5$, with the 50th, 16th and 84th percentiles at $0.01$, $-0.03$, and $0.05$ dex kpc$^{-1}$, respectively. The findings agree well with previous observational studies and simulations at this epoch. We ascribe the observed negative metallicity gradients to a natural result from self-regulating systems, and the positive ones to potential galactic fountains and higher merger rates.",

Wyn Evans, David Chemaly, Daisuke Kawata, Natsuki Funakoshi, Neige Frankel, Sarah G. Kane, Sergey E. Koposov 12 pages, 9 figures, 3 appendices. Submitted to MNRAS. Comments welcome. Key results are shown in Figure 3 and 4 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Stellar orbits in the Galactic disc evolve from their birth to the current shape through both radial migration and dynamical heating. The history of their secular evolution is imprinted in the current kinematics and age-metallicity distribution. We construct a chrono-chemo-dynamical model of the disc, incorporating inside-out growth, metallicity evolution, radial migration, and heating to fit the observed age-metallicity-kinematics distribution of LAMOST subgiant stars in both the low and high-$\\alpha$ disc. By modelling all distribution parameters with spline fitting, we present the first non-parametric stellar migration and heating history of the Galaxy. We determine the heating-to-migration ratio, the ratio of the root-mean-square changes in radial/vertical and azimuthal actions, to be $\\approx0.075$ for radial to azimuthal actions and $\\approx0.015$ for vertical to azimuthal actions, implying a highly anisotropic diffusion in the action space. Furthermore, we identify a transition in radial migration efficiency coinciding with the transition moment of the bimodal disc, for which the radial migration was more efficient for the high-$\\alpha$ disc than for the low-$\\alpha$ disc. This transition may be attributed to two correlated scenarios: 1) a bar formation epoch accompanied by violent outward migration, and 2) a drop in the gas mass fraction in the disc when the low-$\\alpha$ disc began to form. These findings offer further constraints on the formation mechanisms of bimodal discs, favouring the downsizing scenario. We also briefly discuss the connection between our results and recent high-redshift observations. In addition to the secular evolution history, our model maps the Milky Way ISM metallicity gradient at different lookback times, which we find has only varied a little (in the range of $-0.07~\\rm to~-0.10~dex/kpc$) since disc formation.",

Buckley Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We present ClearPotential, a data-driven, three-dimensional measurement of the gravitational potential of the local Milky Way using unsupervised machine learning, without the symmetry assumptions, specific functional forms, and binning required in previous work. The potential is modeled as a neural network, optimized to solve the equilibrium collisionless Boltzmann equation for the observed phase space density of Gaia DR3 Red Clump stars within 4 kpc of the Sun. This density is obtained from data using normalizing flows, and our unsupervised solution to the Boltzmann equation automatically corrects for selection effects from crowding and the dust-driven extinction of starlight. Our fully-differentiable model of the gravitational potential allows us to map the acceleration and mass density of the Galaxy in the volume around the Sun, including in the dust-obscured disk towards the Galactic Center. We determine the dark matter density at the Solar radius to be $(0.84 \\pm 0.08)\\times 10^{-2}\\,{M}_\\odot/{\\rm pc}^3$, and analyze the structure of the dark matter halo. We find strong evidence for a tilted oblate halo, weak preference for a cored inner profile, and the strongest constraints to date on a possible dark matter disk. We place a bound on the timescale of disequilibrium in the local Milky Way, and find mild evidence for disequilibrium using independent acceleration measurements from timings of binary pulsar systems. This work provides the clearest map of the local Galactic potential to date and marks an important step in the era of data-driven astrometry.",

Accepted in Astronomy and Astrophysics on 10/12/2025 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) MATLAS-2019 (also known as NGC5846-UDG1) has attracted significant attention due to the ongoing debate surrounding its Globular Cluster (GC) population, with several studies addressing the issue yet reaching little consensus. In this paper we take advantage of HST's multi-wavelength coverage (F475W, F606W and F814W observations) with the addition of deep u-band imaging from Gran Telescopio de Canarias, to perform the most detailed study and estimation to date of the GC population of the ultra-diffuse galaxy MATLAS-2019. The improved constraints provided by the combination of high spatial resolution and better coverage of the GC spectral energy distribution has allowed us to obtain a clean sample of GCs in this galaxy. We report a number of 33+-3 GCs in MATLAS-2019, supporting the previous lower estimates for this galaxy. The GC population of this galaxy is highly concentrated with ~80% of the GCs inside the effective radius (Re) of the galaxy and the GC half-number radius Re,GC is 0.7Re. Using the GC-Halo mass relation, we estimate a halo mass for MATLAS-2019 of (1.14+-0.1)x10**11 solar masses. The GC luminosity function and the distribution of effective radii of the GCs favour a distance to the galaxy of 20.0+-0.9 Mpc. In agreement with previous findings, we find that the distribution of GCs is highly asymmetric even though the distribution of stars in the galaxy is symmetric. This suggests that assumptions about the symmetry of the GC distribution may be incorrect when used to calculate the number of GCs with such low statistics.",

In this work, we study the properties of outflows in AGN (mostly X-ray-selected) from the GOODS-S field, exploiting JWST NIRSpec IFU observations as part of the GA-NIFS GTO survey. Together with its twin sub-sample from COSMOS reported in a previous GA-NIFS work, this constitutes the largest spatially resolved sample of AGN outflows at these redshifts to date, comprising 16 targets with outflows (out of a total of 19 AGN), and probes the unexplored regime of AGN at z ~ 3-6 with bolometric luminosities ~$10^{45-46}$ erg/s. We mapped the rest-optical ionised gas emission lines at sub-kpc scales and spectrally isolated the broad wings tracing fast outflows from the gas at rest in the host galaxies. The incidence of ionised outflows in the GOODS-S + COSMOS GA-NIFS sample is high (>75\\%), among the highest at any redshift. We inferred outflow velocities between ~600-2000 km/s, maximum radii of <1-4 kpc, and ionised gas mass outflow rates of ~0.1-100 $M_\\odot$/yr, which in some cases can exceed the host galaxy star formation rate (SFR). We find that the outflow properties inferred for the GOODS-S + COSMOS GA-NIFS AGN sample and their relations with $L_{\\rm bol}$ and SFR generally align with those observed for other spatially resolved literature samples of AGN outflows across different redshifts and AGN luminosities. Nonetheless, after accounting for any luminosity bias, our analysis suggests a cosmic evolution of the outflow properties, with higher median mass outflow rates (and possibly also mass loading factors) at higher redshifts, especially at z>3, indicating that AGN outflows were stronger in the early Universe than at later times, and thus potentially more capable of affecting their host galaxy.",

Hunter, Jiancheng Feng Accepted by MNRAS. 16 pages plus appendices with 14 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The connection between dense gas cores and their infant protostars is key to understanding how stars form in molecular clouds. In this paper we investigate the properties, persistence, and protostellar content of cores that would be identified by a dendrogram analysis of 1.3 mm ALMA images. We use a time series of synthetic images produced by post-processing a simulation of star formation in a massive globally collapsing clump, with polaris to calculate dust radiative transfer and CASA to generate synthetic ALMA data. Identifying sinks in the simulation with protostars, we find that most dendrogram-identified cores do not contain any protostars, with many cores being transient features associated with clumpy flow along feeder filaments. Cores with protostars generally host <4, and protostellar mass is not strongly correlated with the mass of the parent cores due to their transience and shifting boundaries. Calculating observationally-relevant intensity-weighted average temperatures for all cores, we find that even at early times the core temperature distribution spans tens of Kelvin, and its width increases with time. The 1.3 mm peak and integrated intensity of the brightest mm core do not increase monotonically as the most massive associated protostar grows, indicating it cannot be assumed that brighter mm sources host more massive protostars. Leveraging the time domain, we test observational properties that have been proposed as potential evolutionary indicators and find that only the total 1.3 mm flux density of the region, the total 1.3 mm flux density in cores, and the number of cores show strong, statistically significant correlation with time.",

Pahl, Leonardo Clarke, Natalie Lam 16 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present argon abundances from a sample of 46 star-forming galaxies at $z=2-3.5$ from the Assembly of Ultradeep Rest-Optical Observations Revealing Astrophysics (AURORA) program. Although argon is an $\\alpha-$element produced by Core Collapse Supernovae (CCSNe), the latest supernova yield models suggest additional argon production and enrichment by Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), unlike other $\\alpha-$elements such as oxygen. To study the relationship between argon and oxygen abundances, we construct two median-stacked composite spectra for separate $z=2.0-2.6$ and $z=2.8-3.5$ redshift bins, presenting more representative measurements than previous samples that require individual detection of faint lines. Abundance ratios were determined using an empirical calibration based on the strength of the [ArIII]$\\lambda7137$ emission line relative to the [OIII]$\\lambda5008$ emission line. With this calibration, we estimate argon abundances (Ar/O) of $0.42^{+0.12}_{-0.10}\\mbox{(Ar/O)}_{\\odot}$ for the $\\langle z \\rangle = 2.26$ bin and $0.42^{+0.12}_{-0.11}\\mbox{(Ar/O)}_{\\odot}$ for the $\\langle z \\rangle = 3.15$ bin, suggesting minimal SNe Ia and dominant CCSNe enrichment in this sample. Comparison of our abundance measurements of $z\\sim 2-3$ AURORA galaxies with chemical evolution modeling of Milky Way stars shows consistency with the Milky Way Bulge component, suggesting a rapid star-formation timescale. However, even larger samples of actively star-forming galaxies with available argon abundances, as well as comparisons between argon abundance and other critical galaxy properties (e.g., sSFR) and models (e.g., one tuned specifically to this redshift range) are needed to draw stronger conclusions on the role of argon in galactic chemical enrichment at Cosmic Noon.",

Using IRAM 30~m observations of N$_2$H$^+$(1--0), N$_2$D$^+$(1--0), H$^{13}$CO$^+$(1--0), and DCO$^+$(2--1), complemented by C$^{18}$O(2--1) data, we derive column density, deuterium fraction, and CO depletion maps. We find that the deuterium fraction in both mentioned nitrogen- and carbon-bearing species increases from the protostellar to the starless core, reaching $R_D^{\\rm N_2H^+}=0.43\\pm0.10$ and $R_D^{\\rm HCO^+}=0.09\\pm0.02$ in the starless core, compared with $0.15\\pm0.03$ and $0.05\\pm0.01$, respectively, in the protostellar core. The CO depletion factor also rises from $4.1\\pm0.1$ to $5.0\\pm0.1$ across the same transition. While the embedded YSO reduces deuteration in the dense inner gas, the less dense envelope traced by HCO$^+$ is only slightly affected at our resolution. Our analysis confirms that CO freeze-out and the presence of a protostar jointly regulate deuterium chemistry in star-forming regions.",

Fox Submitted to ApJ. Comments are welcomed Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We search for weak O VI absorption in the low-redshift intergalactic medium (IGM) using 82 high signal-to-noise quasar spectra obtained with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope. From this dataset, we compile a clean sample of 396 intervening Lyman-alpha (Lya) absorption lines with H I column densities log (N_HI) < 14.5, all of which lack individual O VI absorption with log (N_OVI ) > 13. We perform a spectral stacking analysis at the expected location of the O VI doublet, revealing O VI absorption with a statistical significance greater than 5$\\sigma$, and measure an equivalent width of 1.7 $\\pm$ 0.3 mA, corresponding to log (N_OVI ) = 12.14 $\\pm$ 0.08. The stacked O VI absorption signal associated with strong Lya absorbers (13.5 <= log N_HI < 14.5) is significantly stronger than that associated with weaker Lya absorbers (12.5 <= log N_HI < 13.5). For the subset of 81 broad Lya absorbers (BLAs; b(HI) > 45 km/s), we obtain a marginal $\\sim$3 $\\sigma$ O VI detection. Other than Si III, detected at 5$\\sigma$, no associated metal lines are found. Cross-correlation of the Lya absorbers with galaxies indicates that 93% of these absorbers are not associated with bright galaxies within 1 Mpc, implying that the detected O VI originates in the diffuse IGM rather than the circumgalactic medium. The stacked O VI signal suggests characteristic metallicities of $\\sim 0.01\\,Z_{\\odot}$ under photoionisation and $\\sim 0.001\\,Z_{\\odot}$ under collisional ionisation conditions, though these estimates are model-dependent and assume that O VI and H I trace the same phase. This study provides the first observational evidence for metal absorption in low-column-density Lya systems that individually exhibit no detectable metals, placing important constraints on the metal enrichment of the underdense IGM.",

Smethurst Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Stellar bars are elongated structures in disk galaxies that can torque and funnel gas inward, influencing galaxy evolution. While strong bars are known to induce rapid inflow, the impact of weaker bars remains less certain. We collected spectroscopic data using the Isaac Newton Telescope to analyze 18 nearby galaxies (strongly barred, weakly barred, and unbarred) drawn from Galaxy Zoo DESI. We obtained spatial profiles of equivalent width (EW) and ionized gas velocity dispersion by fitting Gaussian profiles to the H{\\alpha} emission line. Strongly barred galaxies exhibit a distinctive three-peaked EW[H{\\alpha}] structure, consistent with inward funneling of gas. Weakly barred systems lack this pattern, which suggests limited inflow. Velocity dispersion distributions further distinguish the bar types, with strongly barred galaxies showing significantly higher values than weakly barred and unbarred systems. These results suggest that strong bars drive gas inflow, while weak bars exert a limited dynamical influence.",

      "abstract": "The Narrow Emission Lines of Seyfert 1 Galaxies: Comparisons with a Large SDSS Sample Matthew Malkan, Lisbeth Jensen, Lei Hao Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We analyzed a large sample of SDSS spectra of Seyfert galaxies, subdividing Seyfert 1s based on their narrow-to-broad Halpha components. Comparing their narrow-lines (NL) to Seyfert2s in line-ratio diagrams, most of the NL of strong Sy 1.0 and Sy 1.2s (with dominant broad lines) are the same as those of pure Sy2s. In contrast, only 25-30 percent of the Sy1.8 and Sy1.9 nuclei (with weak broad lines) are located in the pure Sy2 region, with the rest falling in the composite-star-forming region. We explain these Seyfert-plus-star-formation spectra with a simple model. It shows that 85 percent of NL in Sy1.9 are from HII-regions, while 88 percent of the NL in Sy 1.0 arise from the same NLR as in pure Sy2. About 6 percent of the strong and weak Sy1's have NL dominated by LINER emission, while 15 percent of intermediate Seyferts (Sy 1.5 and Sy 1.6) do. To confirm this Seyfert 1 AGN plus star formation combination, we used stellar absorption-lines to compare their stellar populations. Their Hdelta strengths show that LINERs, pure Sy2s, and also the broad-line dominated Sy1s have old stellar populations. The weak Sy 1s show stronger Hdelta absorption, indicating larger proportions of young stars. About one third of the u band light in Sy1.0 and 1.2 is blended Balmer lines and continuum from the BLR. The NL gas reddening increases as the BLR strength decreases, from Sy1.0 (0.13 mag), to Sy1.9 (0.40 mag), to Sy2s and LINERs both with 0.50 mag. Our data do not support the simplest version of Seyfert 1 and 2 unification, where both AGN classes have identical NL.",

Bronfman Submitted to ApJ. Comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Millimeter/submillimeter variability is often attributed to dynamical disk-mediated accretion, yet detection is limited to low-mass protostars in nearby clouds. Recent observations have also revealed significant (sub)millimeter variability in high-mass protostars, but the confirmed cases are scarce and lack systematic monitoring. In this work, we analyzed multi-epoch Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 (1.3 mm) continuum observations of 22 massive protoclusters, with epoch separations ranging from a few hours to more than two years, while achieving a consistent angular resolution of approximately 0.3 arcsec. These data allow us to track variability of protostars across a broader mass range and in an environment markedly different from nearby clouds. Using a custom processing pipeline for data reduction, image alignment, and relative flux calibration, we achieve high-precision flux measurements and, for the first time, investigate millimeter variability in massive protoclusters based on interferometric data in a statistical manner. Applying the astrodendro algorithm, we identified 383 condensations and tracked their variations in peak intensities. Standard deviation analysis and difference maps reveal five variable sources, corresponding to a lower limit of 1.3% on the variable fraction. Among these, I13111-6228 stands out as it hosts a hypercompact H II region that exhibits a 68% increase in continuum peak intensity over one year, with an uncertainty of 2%. This supports the burst-mode accretion picture in massive star formation as a viable route for the formation of massive stars.",

Bell, Francesco D'Eugenio, Anna R. Gallazzi, Joel Leja, Stefano Zibetti, Sandro Tacchella Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We analyzed the sizes and star-formation histories (SFHs) of 2908 galaxies with $M_\\star \\geq 10^9$ M$_\\odot$ at $0.6 < z < 1.0$, drawn from the LEGA-C survey. The goal is to investigate the connection between galaxy sizes with SFH, stellar age, and metallicity. SFHs were derived with Prospector by fitting the high signal-to-noise, high spectral resolution spectroscopy drawn from the LEGA-C DR3 together with the broadband photometry from the UltraVISTA catalog. Galaxy sizes were measured by fitting a 2D S{é}rsic profile to the HST ACS~F814W images. We find diverse SFHs and quenching timescales ($\\tau_\\rm{q}$). The main quiescent population quenched over $\\tau_\\rm{q}=1.23\\pm0.04$ Gyr, whereas compact post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) quenched much faster, $\\tau_\\rm{q}=0.13\\pm0.03$ Gyr. At fixed stellar mass, smaller quiescent galaxies quenched more rapidly than larger ones; at fixed size, the dependence on stellar mass is weak. Larger quiescent galaxies are marginally younger, quenched more slowly, and have near-solar metallicities, while compact quiescent galaxies are older, metal-rich, and quenched faster. PSBs formed half their mass later ($z_\\rm{form}\\sim1.9$) and quenched on the shortest timescales. The general trends with galaxy size, $Z_\\star$, and $z_\\rm{form}$ for the quiescent populations remain consistent regardless of the method used to derive the stellar properties. We conclude that compact quiescent galaxies are consistent with both early, moderately fast quenching and with more rapid, late quenching. While this may suggest the existence of multiple quenching channels, our data are also compatible with a continuous distribution of quenching timescales. These findings suggest that different physical mechanisms may drive quenching across galaxy populations, potentially leading to similar morphological outcomes despite differing evolutionary histories.",

Millar Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Recent high-resolution and sensitivity ALMA observations have unveiled the carbon isotope ratios ($^{12}$C/$^{13}$C) of Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in a low-mass protostellar source. To understand the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs, we investigated the carbon isotope fractionation of COMs from prestellar cores to protostellar cores with a gas-grain chemical network model. We confirmed that the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of small molecules are bimodal in the prestellar phase: CO and species formed from CO (e.g., CH$_{3}$OH) are slightly enriched in $^{13}$C compared to the local ISM (by $\\sim$ 10 $\\%$), while those from C and C$^{+}$ are depleted in $^{13}$C owing to isotope exchange reactions. COMs are mainly formed on the grain surface and in the hot gas ($>$ 100 K) in the protostellar phase. The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs depend on which molecules the COMs are formed from. In our base model, some COMs in the hot gas are depleted in $^{13}$C compared to the observations. Thus, We additionally incorporate reactions between gaseous atomic C and H$_{2}$O ice or CO ice on the grain surface to form H$_2$CO ice or \\ce{C2O} ice, as suggested by recent laboratory studies. The direct C-atom addition reactions open pathways to form \\ce{^13C}-enriched COMs from atomic C and CO ice. We find that these direct C-atom addition reactions mitigate $^{13}$C-depletion of COMs, and the model with the direct C-atom addition reactions better reproduces the observations than our base model. We also discuss the impact of the cosmic ray ionization rate on the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of COMs.",

However, stripping alone cannot fully account for the removal of dense, star-forming gas in many satellites, particularly in their inner regions. Recent models and indirect observations have suggested that star formation-driven outflows may play a critical role in expelling this remaining gas, yet direct evidence for such feedback-driven quenching remains limited. Here we report the discovery of an ionized gas outflow in NGC 4064, a Virgo cluster satellite that has already lost most of its cold gas through environmental stripping. MUSE observations from the Multiphase Astrophysics to Unveil the Virgo Environment (MAUVE) survey reveal a bi-polar outflow driven by residual, centrally concentrated star formation in NGC 4064 - despite its current star formation rate being ~0.4 dex below the star-forming main sequence due to prior interaction with the cluster environment. The outflow's mass loading factor is ~2, suggesting that stellar feedback could remove the remaining gas on timescales shorter than those required for depletion by star formation alone. These results demonstrate that even modest but centrally concentrated star formation can drive efficient feedback in stripped satellites, accelerating quenching in the final stages of their evolution.",

Aims: We aim to develop a fast and robust framework for jointly deriving stellar masses and multiplicity statistics of member stars, together with optimal cluster parameters. Methods: We use Gaia DR3 parallaxes together with multi-band photometry of open cluster (OC) members to infer stellar masses and binary mass-ratios through simulation-based inference (SBI), while iteratively fitting the cluster parameters. The validation of our SBI framework on simulated clusters demonstrates that the inclusion of infrared photometry significantly improves the detection of low mass-ratio binaries. The minimum mass-ratio threshold for reliably identifying unresolved binaries depends on cluster properties and the available photometry, but typically lies below $q=0.5$. Results: Applying our method to 42 well-populated OCs, we derive a catalogue of stellar masses and mass-ratios for 27201 stars, achieving typical uncertainties of 0.08 in $q$ and $0.01\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ in the primary stellar mass. We analyse the archetype OCs M67 and NGC 2360 in detail, including mass segregation and mass-ratio distribution among other characteristics, while deriving multiplicity fractions for the rest of the sample. We find evidence that the high mass-ratio ($q\\geq 0.6$) binary fraction shows a strong correlation with the age and a weak anti-correlation with the cluster metallicity. Furthermore, the variation of the binary fraction with stellar mass in OCs shows strong accordance with the observed dependence for field stars heavier than $\\gtrsim0.6\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. Conclusions: Our work paves a path for future population-level investigations of multiplicity statistics and precision stellar masses in extended samples of OCs.",

      "abstract": "OutLines: Modeling Spectral Lines from Winds, Bubbles, and Outflows Sophia R. Flury Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Common methods for studying the kinematics and geometry of outflowing gas rely on modeling emission and absorption lines in integrated spectra using methods that are not physically motivated, including empirical quantiles or fitting multiple Gaussian or Voigt profiles. Such methods are not always consistent with the interpretation of these features and, as a result, miss key underlying physics and can even lead to inaccurate interpretations of observations. To address this problem, we present the publicly available python code OutLines, which provides astrophysical models of spectral emission and absorption line profiles produced by outflows in a variety of environments. The OutLines code accounts for differences in parameterization of the velocity field and density profile while allowing for different outflow geometries, making OutLines versatile and useful for a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena. We demonstrate the wide applicability of OutLines by using the code to model line profiles in an H II region knot, super star clusters, a starburst galaxy, and an AGN. In each of these contexts, we illustrate how OutLines can illuminate key underlying physics in ways that improve our scientific understanding and address important open questions in astronomy, including the key mechanisms in the baryon cycle, the evolution of H II regions and galaxies, and even Lyman continuum escape. OutLines will be a critical resource as massively multiplexed spectroscopic surveys like WEAVE-LOFAR and 4MOST/WAVES come online, providing the means to probe feedback kinematics with deeper, higher resolution spectroscopy for unprecedented large samples of galaxies.",

Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Chemical abundance radial gradients provide key information on how the processes that affect chemical enrichment of the gas-phase interstellar medium (ISM) act at different galaxy scales. Whereas in the last decades there has been an increase in the number of galaxies studied with integral field spectroscopy, there is still not a clear picture on a subsequent characterization of the chemical abundance radial gradients in galaxies hosting Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). This lack of analysis is even more accentuated in the case of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs). For the first time, we analyze the chemical abundance radial gradients in a sample of LINER-like galaxies, whose nuclear emission has been previously (Paper I) discussed. We use a sample of 97 galaxies from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA), whose nuclear regions show LINER-like emission. We use the open-source code HII-CHI-Mistry to estimate the chemical abundance ratios 12+log(O/H) and log(N/O) in the HII regions across the disks in our sample, as well as in the nuclear parts where the LINER-like activity dominates. To fit the radial profiles we use a piecewise methodology which uses a non-fixed number of breaks to find the best fit for the data. We obtain that majority of our sample of galaxies exhibits departures from the single linear gradient both in 12+log(O/H) and log(N/O) (as expected from the inside-out scenario). We investigate whether these departures are driven by galaxy properties (stellar mass, neutral gas mass, stellar velocity dispersion), finding not correlation at all. We also report that in most cases there is no correlation between the shape of the 12+log(O/H) and log(N/O) radial profiles. We propose a model in which AGN (feed)back, acting at different scales depending on the galaxy and its evolutionary stage, might be responsible for these departures.",

Hunter, Edvige Corbelli 17 pages, 8 figures, accepted by ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The surface densities of star formation, Sigma_SFR, in 24 dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxies from the LITTLE THINGS survey are combined with gas surface densities and midplane pressures to examine the correlations found previously for spiral galaxies. The pressure is the weight of the disk inside the gas layer, including gas, stars, and dark matter, which usually dominates disk gravity in dIrrs. We compare the results to the outer part of M33, which has similar local properties but a slightly higher metallicity, enabling the detection of CO. All the data are convolved to the HI beam, but to study the effects of resolution, the galaxies are examined first with average radial profiles, and then with maps having 1.5\" pixels and 244 pc pixels. The correlations are found to be independent of resolution from 24 pc to 424 pc. The average ratio of molecular to atomic surface density is estimated to be 0.23+-0.1, from the H_2 surface density in M33 compared to the HI surface density at the same Sigma_SFR in the dIrrs. With this ratio, the average star formation rate per molecule is about the same for all the dIrrs, and a factor of 2 less than the rate in M33. The pressure in dIrrs is so low that CO is essentially a dense gas tracer, with the same surface density threshold at the low metallicities of dIrrs as HCN has in spiral galaxies. As a result, CO regions in dIrrs should be strongly self-gravitating.",

Comments welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The properties of dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way (MW) are useful for testing models of the formation of our Galaxy, and by extension various theories of cosmology. Recent efforts to measure the masses of the MW's satellite dwarf galaxies have relied on the motions and positions of stars in the MW's disk and halo, which are perturbed by the passage of satellite galaxies. As there are many known processes in our Galaxy that lead to observed disequilibrium in stars, these kinematic methods have been limited by the inherent difficulty in identifying only the perturbations due to particular satellite galaxies. We present a novel method for determining the masses of two MW satellite galaxies -- the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy (Sgr dSph) -- using only direct, instantaneous acceleration data derived from extremely precise timing of millisecond pulsars near the Sun. As the LMC and Sgr dSph orbit the MW, they cause wave-like distortions in the structure of the disk plus a large-scale offset in the centers of mass of the dark matter halo and the baryonic disk. These two effects lead to asymmetric accelerations above and below the disk midplane near the Sun, which is observed in the pulsar acceleration data. Notably, the amplitude of this asymmetry is shown to depend on the masses of the orbiting satellites. We analyze a grid of simulations with varying masses of each satellite. We find the total (dark + baryon) mass enclosed within the tidal radius at the present day for the LMC to be 4.1 $\\pm$ 1.0 $\\times$ 10$^{10}$ M$_\\odot$ within a radius of 16.6 kpc, and for Sgr to be 3.5 $\\pm$ 2.4 $\\times$ 10$^8$ M$_\\odot$ within a radius of 5 kpc. These results are generally consistent and competitive with previous determinations of the masses of these objects, but entirely independent of any stellar kinematic data for the first time.",

Indeed, theoretical models and hydrodynamical simulations have suggested that stars could form within galactic outflows, representing a new mode of star-formation that differs significantly from the typical star formation in star forming discs. In this paper, we examine 12 local galaxies with powerful Active Galactic Nuclei and high star-formation rate using spectroscopic data from the X-shooter spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. We investigate the excitation mechanism and physical properties of these outflows via spatially resolved diagnostic diagrams (along with tests to rule out contribution by shocks and external photoionisation). Out of the seven galaxies with clearly detected outflows, we find robust evidence for star formation within the outflow of one galaxy (IRAS 20551-4250), with two additional galaxies showing tentative signs (IRAS 13120-5453 and F13229-2934). Therefore, our findings support previous results that star formation inside outflows can be a relatively common phenomenon among these active galaxies and may have played an important role in the formation and evolution of the spheroidal component of galaxies.",

As key tracers of hierarchical structure formation, subhalos are among the most important objects within these simulations. In our previous work, we established that the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) can effectively extract clustering information and serve as a robust halo finder. Here, we extend the CWT framework to subhalo identification by adapting the CWTHF (Continuous Wavelet Transform Halo Finder) code. This extension extends the unbinding procedure, which enables the reliable identification of gravitationally bound substructures. The algorithm identifies density peaks within known halos or subhalos and segments the surrounding volume accordingly. Once a new subhalo is registered, its position is recorded to prevent duplicate detection. We validate our approach using the TNG50-2 and TNG100-1 simulations, as well as a single Friends-of-Friends (FOF) halo, by comparing the resulting CWT catalog against the reference SUBFIND catalog. Because the method inherits the original computational framework, our subhalo finder maintains a favorable linear time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(N)$.",

Abundances for 27 elements, ranging from carbon to dysprosium, were derived. Our results support the original classification that Turranburra, with a low average metallicity of $\\mathrm{[Fe/H]=-2.45} \\pm 0.07$, likely originates from a dwarf-galaxy progenitor. Willka Yaku has a low average metallicity of $\\mathrm{[Fe/H]=-2.35 \\pm 0.03}$ with a small scatter in the abundances, consistent with a globular cluster progenitor as suggested by previous studies. Both streams exhibit mild enhancements in neutron-capture elements, with averages of $\\mathrm{[Eu II/Fe]}=$ $0.47 \\pm{0.09}$ for Turranburra and $0.44 \\pm{0.05}$ for Willka Yaku, consistent with enrichment from an $r$-process event. A similar enrichment is observed in other stellar streams, and we further discuss this signature as it relates to the potential enrichment histories of these two streams.",

Meanwhile, the GALAH DR4 survey has spectroscopically characterised nearly one million stars, delivering detailed chemical abundances (up to 30 elements). We present a joint analysis of the $\\sim$ 6 000 stars common to both catalogues, offering initial insights into the stellar and chemical properties of the solar neighborhood.

Additionally, most of the stars are disc members, with some local halo (high-velocity) stars identified. Building on this foundation, future work will deeper exploit the full spectroscopic information and orbital parameters from value-added catalogues to refine Galactic component classifications (thin-thick disc versus halo membership), perform detailed chemical profiling, and deliver a comprehensive chemo-dynamical characterisation of the solar neighborhood. This will provide new insights into the formation and evolution of nearby stellar populations.",

In this work, we refined the LAMOST DR10 M-type star catalog through a two-stage process. First, we purified the catalog using techniques including deep learning and color-magnitude diagrams to remove 22,496 non-M spectra, correct 2,078 dwarf/giant classifications, and update 12,900 radial velocities. This resulted in a cleaner catalog containing 870,518 M-type spectra (820,493 dwarfs, 50,025 giants). Second, applying a label transfer strategy using values from APOGEE DR16 for parameter prediction with a ten-fold cross-validated CNN ensemble architecture, we predicted $T_\\text{eff}$, $\\log g$, [M/H], and [$\\alpha$/M] separately for M dwarfs and giants. The average internal errors for M dwarfs/giants are respectively: $T_\\text{eff}$ 30/17 K, log $g$ 0.07/0.07 dex, [M/H] 0.07/0.05 dex, and [$\\alpha$/M] 0.02/0.02 dex. Comparison with APOGEE demonstrates external precisions of 34/14 K, 0.12/0.07 dex, 0.09/0.04 dex, and 0.03/0.02 dex for M dwarfs/giants, which represents precision improvements of over 20\\% for M dwarfs and over 50\\% for M giants compared to previous literature results.

The detection of substructure in discs around Class I protostars challenges current models of disc evolution, suggesting that planets may form earlier than previously expected ($<1$ Myr). In the context of the ALMA Large Program FAUST, we present observations of the circumbinary disc (CBD) around the young binary system L1551 IRS 5. The CBD exhibits two prominent over-densities in the continuum emission at the edge of the cavity, with the Northern over-density being about 20% brighter than the Southern one. By analysing the disc morphology and kinematics of L1551 IRS 5, we delineate dynamical constraints on the binary's orbital parameters. Additionally, we present 3D hydrodynamical models of the CBD to predict both the dust and the gas surface densities. Then, we compare the resulting synthetic observations with ALMA observations of the continuum emission at 1.3 mm and the C$^{18}$O line emission. Our analysis suggests that the density enhancements observed with ALMA in L1551 IRS 5 can be caused by interactions between the binary stars and the CBD, leading to dust concentration within the disc. We conclude that the observed over-density corresponds to a location where could potentially grow under favourable conditions.",

Infrared telescopes such as JWST have made it possible to study the earliest feedback phases, when stars are shielded by cocoons of gas and dust. This phase is crucial for unravelling the effects of feedback from young stars, leading to their emergence and the dispersal of their host molecular clouds. Here we show that the transition from the embedded to the exposed phase of star formation is short (< 4 Myr) and sometimes almost absent (< 1 Myr), across a sample of 37 nearby star-forming galaxies, covering a wide range of morphologies from massive barred spirals to irregular dwarfs. The short duration of the dust-clearing timescales suggests a predominant role of pre-supernova feedback mechanisms in revealing newborn stars, confirming previous results on smaller samples and allowing, for the first time, a statistical analysis of their dependencies. We find that the timescales associated with mid-infrared emission at 21 {\\mu}m, tracing a dust-embedded feedback phase, are controlled by a complex interplay between giant molecular cloud properties (masses and velocity dispersions) and galaxy morphology. We report relatively longer durations of the embedded phase of star formation in barred spiral galaxies, while this phase is significantly reduced in low-mass irregular dwarf galaxies. We discuss tentative trends with gas-phase metallicity, which may favor faster cloud dispersal at low metallicities.",

The combination of the CANUCS+TEC provides multi-epoch, deep NIRCam images in all medium bands (MBs) and broad bands (BBs) onboard NIRCam (22 filters in total), over $\\sim23\\ {\\rm arcmin}^2$ in three independent lines of sight. We select high-$z$ galaxy candidates based on photometric redshifts, and obtain eight candidates at $z\\sim10-16$, including a very robust candidate at $z\\sim15.4$. The ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) from our sample is consistent with previous JWST studies showing a scatter of $\\sim0.6$ dex across the literature, marking the significance of the field-to-field variance in interpreting galaxy abundance measurements at $z>10$. We find that the UV LF moderately evolves at $z>10$, and the LF normalization and the luminosity density decline by a factor of $\\sim7$ from $z\\sim11$ to $z\\sim15$, indicating less steep evolution than $z<11$. We highlight the importance of MB filters, not only to minimize the contamination by low-$z$ interlopers but also to maximize the completeness. In particular, faint and less blue galaxies could be missed when the sample is built solely on BB data. The contamination and incompleteness of BB-only selected samples can bias our views of earliest galaxy evolution at $z>10$, including the UV LF by $\\sim0.6$ dex, the size-magnitude relation by $\\sim0.6$ dex, and the UV slope-magnitude relation by $\\Delta\\beta_{\\rm UV}\\sim-0.3$.",

We infer the total stellar mass in clusters by normalizing and integrating the stellar cluster mass function (SCMF, dn(M)/dM ~ (n$_0$) $M^\\beta$), assuming three different slopes $\\beta$ = -1.5, -2.0 and -2.5 and different lower-mass limits between $10^2$ and $10^5$ Msun. The total integrated cluster stellar mass is compared to the stellar mass inferred from the counter-image of the Cosmic Gems, which provides the best, modestly magnified ($\\mu$ = 1.84$\\pm$0.05) representation of the entire galaxy. The delensed stellar mass of the Cosmic Gems galaxy is estimated as 3.5$_{-1.8}^{+3.3}$ x$10^7$ Msun, with an effective radius of Reff = 103$_{-15}^{+13}$ parsec and a stellar surface mass density of $\\Sigma$mass = 520$_{-225}^{+340}$ Msun pc$^{-2}$. Accounting for normalization uncertainties - including different lensing magnification scenarios for the arc - a modified SCMF, combined with a significantly high star cluster formation efficiency (approaching 100%), appears to be a necessary condition to explain the relatively short formation timescale of both the star clusters and the counter-image, without exceeding the galaxy's stellar mass. By extrapolating the physical properties at the peak of the burst we find that in its recent past (<~ 30 Myr) the Cosmic Gems galaxy has likely experienced a specific star formation rate (sSFR) exceeding 25 Gyr$^{-1}$ and luminosity approaching the ``blue monster'' regime (M$_{UV}$ < -20). Our study provides insights into the extreme clustered nature of star formation in early galaxies and shed light into the formation of bound star clusters that might survive to z = 0 as globular clusters, older than 13 Gyr.",

Accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal. Only Figure 6 has been updated for typos; the rest of the manuscript is unchanged Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We report a narrowband technosignature search toward five Milky Way globular clusters (NGC 6171, NGC 6218, NGC 6254, NGC 6838, and IC 1276) using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) 19-beam L-band receiver (1.05-1.45 GHz). We adapt the MultiBeam Point-source Scanning (MBPS) strategy to extended targets by gating detections to generalized on-target windows (gOTWs), i.e. the time intervals when a beam main lobe intersects a buffered cluster mask, and by enforcing the deterministic multibeam illumination sequence as a geometry test. Dynamic spectra with frequency resolution about 7.5 Hz and time resolution about 10 s are searched with turboSETI over drift rates |nu_dot| <= 4 Hz s^-1 at signal-to-noise ratio S/N >= 10. From about 2.75e5 raw hits across both linear polarizations, none survive the gOTW gating, array-wide simultaneity veto, in-stripe ordering, and single-drift coherence checks, yielding a robust null result. With system equivalent flux density SEFD about 1.5 Jy and an effective 60 s per illuminated crossing, our per-crossing flux density threshold is S_min about 0.50 Jy, corresponding to minimum isotropic-equivalent radiated power EIRP_min in the range (0.72-1.8)e16 W for cluster distances 4-6.5 kpc; when multiple illuminated crossings occur, non-coherent stacking improves sensitivity by up to sqrt(N). To our knowledge this is the first FAST technosignature survey dedicated to globular clusters and the first to use MBPS as the primary observing strategy. These limits disfavor bright, persistent, isotropic L-band beacons above the stated thresholds during our epochs and establish a scalable blueprint, based on geometry-aware gating and verification, for multi-epoch MBPS campaigns that expand signal morphologies and combine passes to deepen constraints on transmitters in dense stellar systems.",

In ultra-luminous infrared galaxies, in which the star-formation rate reaches thousands of solar masses per year, the gas and dust are considerably affected by the ionizing radiation, cosmic rays and shock waves, that can be about a factor of 100--1000 larger than typical values in quiet star-forming galaxies. In these conditions, the emissivity of the gas and dust changes: in dense gas, high ionic and molecular transitions become excited, while dust grains are heated to high temperatures. In this paper, we analyze the possibilities for studying the interstellar medium in extreme conditions of ultra-luminous infrared galaxies at redshifts of $\\sim 0-3$, utilizing the atomic and molecular lines, and dust continuum in far infrared range of $100-500\\mu$m.

MWISP DR1 link: this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present the first data release (DR1) of the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) survey, a mapping in the J=(1-0) transition lines of 12CO, 13CO, and C18O toward the northern Galactic plane during 2011-2022. The MWISP survey was conducted using the PMO 13.7 m telescope at a spatial resolution of approximately 50\" and a velocity resolution of 0.16 km/s at 115 GHz. DR1 fully covered 2310 square degrees within the Galactic longitude (l) and latitude (b) range of 9.75 deg =< l =< 229.75 deg and |b| =< 5.25 deg. The surveyed area was divided into cell units of 30'x30' for practical purposes and On-The-Fly (OTF) mapping was performed toward each target cell unit. The data were regridded into a regular 3D datacube in l-b-V_LSR with a pixel size of 30\" in l-b axes and 0.16 km/s in theV_LSR axis. The median rms noise is 0.47 K, 0.25 K, and 0.25 K for 12CO, 13CO, and C18O, respectively. The equivalent 3 sigma sensitivity in 12CO luminosity is approximately 0.23 K km/s, making MWISP the most sensitive survey of its kind. In this paper, we describe the survey data, including the calibration, data cleaning, data mosaic processes, and the data products. The final mosaicked data cubes contain about 3.33x10^7 spectra (pixels) for each CO isotopologue line. Color composite images, made from the intensities of the isotopologue lines, and some concise descriptions are provided. We constructed a molecular cloud catalog based on the mosaicked 12CO data cube using the clustering algorithm DBSCAN, detecting 103,517 molecular clouds, 10,790 of which exhibit 13CO emission and 304 of which show C18O emission. Based on the histogram of voxel brightness temperature, we estimated a total 12CO flux of 7.69+/-0.38x10^7 K km/s arcmin^2, 82% of which is captured by the DBSCAN algorithm. The data, together with the cloud sample, provide unique information on molecular gas in the northern Milky Way.",

Medling, Kristina Nyland, Andreea Petric, Namrata Roy, Mamiko Sato, Elizaveta Sazonova, Adam Smercina, Akshat Tripathi Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Outflows are one of the most spectacular mechanisms through which active galactic nuclei (AGN) impact their host galaxy, though the role of AGN-driven outflows in global star formation regulation across the galaxy population is unclear. NGC 1266 is an excellent case study for investigating the outflows and star formation quenching because it is a nearby (D\\sim30 Mpc) AGN host galaxy with an outflow driving shocks through the interstellar medium (ISM) and has recently quenched its star formation outside the nucleus. While previous works have studied the molecular outflow from its CO emission, to fully characterize the impact the outflow has on the ISM observations probing the dense, cold gas are necessary. Our ALMA cycle 0 observations do not detect a molecular outflow in 13CO(2-1) and yield a lower limit 12CO/13CO \\geq 250, suggesting a highly optically thin CO outflow with low 13CO abundance. In contrast, we detect substantial HCN(1-0) emission in the outflow, with an HCN(1-0)/12CO(1-0) ratio of 0.09, consistent with global measurements of many star-forming galaxies and Luminous InfraRed Galaxies (LIRGs). We conclude that the CO emission traces a diffuse component of the molecular gas with a low optical depth, whereas the HCN(1-0) traces dense clumps of gas entrained in the outflow. We measure an upper limit molecular outflow rate of < 85 Msun/yr. Assuming the ongoing nuclear star formation and outflow continue at the same rates, NGC 1266 will deplete its gas reservoirs in 450 Myr or longer, indicating that relatively low-level AGN feedback is capable of gradually expelling the molecular gas reservoir after a rapid quenching event.",

This aimed to bridge the gap between those in position of privilege, with ease of access to international events (i.e., the typical experience of academics in Western institutions), with those historically excluded (affecting the majority of African scientists/institutions). We describe how we designed the conference around cutting-edge research problems, but with a parallel focus on building networking and professional relationships. Significant effort went into: (1) ensuring a diversity of participants; (2) practically and financially supporting those who may never have attended an international conference and; (3) creating an inclusive and supportive environment through a careful programme of activities, both before and during the event. Maintaining scientific integrity was a core commitment throughout. We summarise successes, challenges and lessons learnt from organising this conference. We also present feedback obtained from participants immediately after the conference, and a discussion of some longer-term impacts, which we identified around 1 year later. We found an overall achievement of our objectives, and multiple longer-term benefits. With this report we provide some key recommendations for groups, from any research field, who may wish to lead similar initiatives.",

Pedersen 14 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables (plus 11 pages of figures in Appendix), Submitted to A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Applications (stat.AP) Gravity modes in main-sequence stars have traditionally been studied using a prewhitening approach, which iteratively identifies modes in the Fourier domain and subsequently tunes their frequencies, amplitudes, and phases through time-domain regression. While effective, this method becomes inefficient when analysing large volumes of long time-series data and often relies on subjective stopping criteria to determine the number of iterations. We aim to perform frequency extraction of gravity modes in slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars using a statistically robust, data-driven approach based on advanced power spectrum and harmonic analysis techniques. Our approach employs the multitaper non-uniform fast Fourier transform, mtNUFFT, a power spectrum estimator that addresses several statistical limitations of traditional methods such as the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. We apply its extension, the multitaper F-test, to extract coherent gravity modes from 4-year Kepler light curves of SPB stars and to search for period spacing patterns among the extracted modes. The multitaper F-test enables fast and accurate extraction of the properties of gravity modes with quasi-infinite lifetimes, preferentially selecting modes that exhibit purely periodic behaviour. Although the method typically extracts fewer frequencies than conventional prewhitening, it recovers most known modes and, in some cases, reveals new ones. We also find evidence for gravity modes with long but finite lifetimes, and detect more than one period spacing pattern in some of the studied SPB stars. Overall, the multitaper F-test offers a more objective and statistically sound alternative to prewhitening. It scales efficiently to large datasets containing thousands of pulsators, and has the potential to facilitate mode identification and to distinguish between the different excitation mechanisms operating in SPB stars.",

Additional follow up of systems with radio emission is key to understanding the true origin of the emission, since multiple astrophysical mechanisms can plausibly lead to such signals. While nineteen M dwarfs were detected by LOFAR in circular polarization as part of the V-LoTSS survey, HD~220242 is the only F star to have a circularly polarized low frequency radio detection in the same survey. We conducted radial velocity follow up with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder and combined these observations with additional archival RVs and \\textit{Hipparcos}-\\textit{Gaia} proper motion accelerations to determine that HD~220242 has a stellar companion with P=16.79$\\pm$0.04\\,yrs and a mass of $0.619\\pm0.014$\\,M$_\\odot$. We use Spectral Energy Distribution fitting and lack of any UV excess to rule out a co-evolved white dwarf companion and confirm that the companion is an M dwarf star. Given that F stars lack the coronal properties to produce such coherent emission, and the companion mass and lack of UV excess are consistent with an M dwarf, the radio emission is most plausibly associated with the companion.",

Version of the manuscript before the language editor A&A Volume 704, December 2025, article number A22 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Space missions like CoRoT, Kepler, and TESS have made asteroseismology a powerful probe of stellar interiors. Red giants are key targets thanks to their rich mixed-mode oscillation spectra, which reveal properties of both core and envelope. However, current models of core helium-burning red giants still fail to fully reproduce observed oscillation patterns, largely due to uncertainties in mixing processes such as overshooting and semi-convection. This motivates the need for better seismic constraints to refine stellar models. We investigate how internal structural features shape asteroseismic signatures in core helium-burning stars, focusing on the links between seismic properties and internal chemical profiles. Using an updated version of the Liege stellar evolution code and its adiabatic oscillation code, we compute and analyse mixed-mode patterns for a range of stellar models. Our results show that sharp chemical gradients and central overshooting strongly influence the mixed-mode spectra. Changes in overshooting modify the extent of the semi-convective region, altering the local Brunt-Vaisala frequency and thus the observed period spacing. Variations in overshooting are compensated by shifts in semi-convective layers, keeping the total mixed-core size nearly constant across models. As a result, stellar evolution is only mildly affected, while the seismic signatures, especially the Brunt-Vaisala frequency profile, are highly sensitive to these internal adjustments.",

In rapidly rotating stars, BMRs are expected to emerge at high latitudes, which are less efficient in generating the poloidal field due to poor cross-equatorial cancellation. The operation of the Babcock-Leighton dynamo in rapidly rotating stars is therefore questionable. We, for the first time, using a 3D kinematic dynamo model, STABLE, explore this question. By taking large-scale flows from mean-field hydrodynamics models for stars rotating at different speeds, We conduct a series of dynamo simulations in rapidly rotating stars, exploring the following four cases of spot deposition, each based on a different assumption about toroidal flux tube rise: (i) radial rise, (ii) parallel rise to the rotation axis, (iii) parallel rise combined with an increase in Joy's law slope with the stellar rotation rate, and (iv) increasing time delay and spot size. We find cyclic magnetic fields in all cases except case IV of the 1-day rotating star, for which the magnetic field is irregular. For the parallel-rise cases, the magnetic field becomes quadrupolar, and for all other cases, it is dipolar. Our work demonstrates that the Babcock-Leighton dynamo may operate even in rapidly rotating stars with starspots appearing at higher latitudes.",

Objectives include the discovery of exotic hot subdwarfs, resolving distinct subclasses, identifying evolutionary sequences, and establishing the past and future histories of many of these unusual stars. This paper extends the sample described by Jeffery et al. (2021) (arXiv:2011.09523) from 100 to 697 stars. It describes the selection criteria and presents spectral classifications based on the MK-like Drilling system. The sample includes 283 extremely helium-rich hot subdwarfs, 17 extreme helium stars, 110 intermediate helium-rich hot subdwarfs, as well as 21 helium-rich stars of other types. It now represents the largest homogeneous sample of both \"normal\" He-sdOs and \"luminous\" or \"hot\" He-sdOs. Interesting stars discovered include magnetic hot subdwarfs, extremely hot pre-white dwarfs and hot subdwarfs, including hot subdwarfs showing NV emission, one short-period binary, new extreme helium stars and several double-subdwarf candidates.

While single stars can swell following the chemical evolution of their interior, stars belonging to binary systems cannot overflow the size of the Roche lobe and hydrostatic equilibrium is strictly impossible. The system is forced to exchange mass between its members through the inner Lagrangian point. In the first part of the paper, we discuss the standard evolution of binaries that have a non-degenerate donor star and a compact companion. We show that the model fails when to account for the occurrence of binary pulsars when they predict a long-standing mass transfer episode. Models including irradiation feedback and evaporation in close binaries are examined next. Following these sections, we discuss the case of systems with a black hole (BH). We show that if BHs are born non-rotating, binary interaction seems insufficient to speed them up, an indication that BH rotation is a feature present at birth. Finally, we discuss Blue Straggler Stars detected in open and globular clusters. Since they cannot be understood as single-born stars, we evaluate one of the proposed channels is mass transfer in close binaries, and discuss its viability and the limitations of the present models.",

Supplementary animations available at this https URL Space Physics (physics.space-ph); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Many coronal mass ejections (CMEs) initially propagate non-radially, and then transition to radial propagation in the corona. This directional transition is a significant process that determines a CME's space weather effects but remains poorly understood. Based on multi-wavelength observations, we investigate the transition from non-radial to radial propagation in the low corona for two large-scale CMEs from the same active region on the solar limb. In the beginning, both CMEs move in a non-radial direction, beneath a system of overlying loops that are roughly parallel to the flux-rope axis. The CMEs laterally deform by bulging their upper flanks in the non-radial stage toward the higher corona, which results in the transition to a radial propagation direction approximately 25$^\\circ$ away from the eruption site. After the directional transition, the non-radial-stage upper flank becomes the leading edge in the radial stage. Although the overlying loops do not strap over the flux rope, their strong magnetic tension force constrains the radial expansion of part of the CME during the transition by acting on the flux-rope legs. A major portion of the filament is displaced to the southern part of a CME in the radial stage, which implies the complexity of observational CME features. This study presents the first investigation of the lateral deformation during the transition of CMEs from non-radial to radial in the low corona, and makes an essential contribution to the complete CME evolution picture.",

Astrophys. 25 125009 Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Stellar atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances are traditionally determined using template matching techniques based on high-resolution spectra. However, these methods are sensitive to noise and unsuitable for ultra-low-resolution data. Given that the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) will acquire large volumes of ultra-low-resolution spectra, developing effective methods for ultra-low-resolution spectral analysis is crucial. In this work, we investigated the Fully Connected Residual Network (FCResNet) for simultaneously estimating atmospheric parameters ($T_\\text{eff}$, $\\log g$, [Fe/H]) and elemental abundances ([C/Fe], [N/Fe], [Mg/Fe]). We trained and evaluated FCResNet using CSST-like spectra (\\textit{R} $\\sim$ 200) generated by degrading LAMOST spectra (\\textit{R} $\\sim$ 1,800), with reference labels from APOGEE. FCResNet significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods (KNN, XGBoost, SVR) and CNN in prediction precision. For spectra with g-band signal-to-noise ratio greater than 20, FCResNet achieves precisions of 78 K, 0.15 dex, 0.08 dex, 0.05 dex, 0.10 dex, and 0.05 dex for $T_\\text{eff}$, $\\log g$, [Fe/H], [C/Fe], [N/Fe] and [Mg/Fe], respectively, on the test set. FCResNet processes one million spectra in only 42 seconds while maintaining a simple architecture with just 348 KB model size. These results suggest that FCResNet is a practical and promising tool for processing the large volume of ultra-low-resolution spectra that will be obtained by CSST in the future.",

To investigate the effects of RDs on proton kinetics, we model a pair of switchback-boundary-like RDs with a hybrid Particle-In-Cell (PIC) approach in a 2D system. We find that, at one of the boundary RDs, a significant population of protons remains trapped over long times, creating a secondary beam-like component with temperature anisotropy $T_\\perp/T_\\|\\gtrsim4$ in the proton velocity distribution function that excites ion cyclotron waves within the downstream portion of the transition layer. Further analysis suggests that the static electric field in the vicinity of the RD is the key factor in trapping the protons. This work indicates that switchback boundaries could represent a viable environment for the creation of proton beams in the heliosphere; it also highlights the need to investigate RD sub-structures, especially the embedded current systems of interplanetary RDs. Finally, this paper underscores the importance of high-resolution observations of the solar wind velocity distributions around RDs.",

Wardenier 36 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables, accepted to Nature Communications Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The elemental compositions of exoplanets encode information about their formation environments and internal structures. While volatile ratios such as carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) are used to trace formation location, the rock-forming elements - magnesium (Mg), silicon (Si), and iron (Fe) - govern interior mineralogy and are commonly assumed to reflect the host star's abundances. Yet this assumption remains largely untested. Ultra-hot Jupiters, gas-giant exoplanets with dayside temperatures above 3000 K, provide rare access to refractory elements that remain gaseous. Here we present high-resolution thermal emission spectroscopy of the exoplanet WASP-189b (Teq = 3354^{+27}_{-34} K) obtained with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) on Gemini South. We detect neutral iron (Fe I), magnesium (Mg I), silicon (Si I), water (H_2O), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydroxyl (OH) at signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 4, and retrieve their elemental abundances. We show that the Mg/Si, Fe/Mg, and Si/Fe ratios are consistent with stellar values, while the refractory-to-volatile ratio is enhanced by roughly a factor of ~2. These findings demonstrate that giant-planet atmospheres can preserve stellar-like rock-forming ratios, providing an empirical validation of the stellar-proxy assumption that underpins planetary composition and formation models across exoplanet systems.",

By dynamically coupling magnetically mediated spin-down to tidally induced spin-up from close orbiting substellar companions, we show that tides from sub-stellar companions may explain these trends. In particular, brown dwarf companions can delay the spin-down and explain the dearth of field, late-type M dwarfs with intermediate rotation periods. We find that tidal forces also strongly influence stellar X-ray activity evolution, so that methods of gyrochronological aging must be generalized for stars with even sub-stellar companions. We also discuss how the theoretical predictions of the spin evolution model can be used with future data to constrain the population distribution of companion orbital separations.",

Published in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) hosts 12 known Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, seven of which are apparently single. Their formation is a challenge for current stellar evolution models because line-driven winds are generally assumed to be quenched at a metallicity of Z < 0.004. Here, we present a set of mesa models of single stars with zero-age main sequence masses of 20 - 80 Msun considering different initial rotation speeds ({\\Omega} = 0 - 0.7 {\\Omega}_c), metallicities (Z = 0.002 - 0.0045), and wind mass-loss models (optically thin and thick winds). We show that if we account for optically thick winds, fast rotating ({\\Omega} = 0.6 {\\Omega}_c) single metal-poor O-type stars (with M > 20 Msun) shed their envelope and become WR stars even at the low metallicity of the SMC. The luminosity, effective temperature, evolutionary timescale, surface abundance, and rotational velocity of our simulated WR stars are compatible to the WRs observed in the SMC. We speculate that this scenario can also alleviate the excess of giant stars across the Humphreys-Davidson limit. Our results have key implications for black hole masses, (pair instability) supernova explosions, and other observable signatures.",

We present a comprehensive analysis of seven red supergiants, for which we searched evidence of episodic mass loss, in three low-metallicity galaxies: NGC~6822, IC~10, and WLM. Initially, the spectral classification of their optical spectra was refined and compared to previous reported classifications, finding four sources that display spectral variability. We derived the physical properties of five of them using the \\textsc{marcs} atmospheric models corrected for nonlocal thermal equilibrium effects to measure stellar properties from our new near-infrared spectra, such as the effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and microturbulent velocity. Additional empirical and theoretical methods were employed to calculate effective temperatures, finding consistent results. We constructed optical and infrared light curves, discovering two targets in NGC~6822 with photometric variability between 1 and 2.5 mag in amplitude in r and ~ 0.5 mag in the mid-infrared. Furthermore, we discovered a candidate-dimming event in one of these sources. Periods for three red supergiants were determined using epoch photometry, which were consistent with the empirical estimations from literature period-luminosity relations. Our comprehensive analysis of all the available data for each target provides evidence for episodic mass loss in four red supergiants.",

Updated 21/11/2025 to fix a typo in base density value. Updated 11/12/2025 to fix value of the orbital period of HIP 15429 in Introduction Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present a detailed analysis of the early post-mass-transfer binary HD 698 (V742 Cas) combining high-resolution optical spectroscopy, long-baseline interferometry, and radiative-transfer modeling. Counter-phased radial-velocity curves yield a circular orbit with P=55.927+/-0.001 d and component masses M_Be=7.48+/-0.07 M_sun and M_comp=1.23+/-0.02 M_sun. The Be primary is traced by broad H alpha wings, while narrow metallic absorption lines arise from a slowly rotating companion. The interferometric separation implies a dynamical distance of 888+/-5 pc. The spectral energy distribution is reproduced with E(B-V)=0.321+/-0.016 and a viscous decretion disk of base density rho_0~5x10^-12 g cm^-3 at r=R_eq, declining radially as rho(r)~r^-n with n=3.0. The companion is luminous and inflated, with T_eff=10.0(+0.2,-0.1) kK, R_comp=13.1+/-0.2 R_sun, and log(L/L_sun)=3.19, contributing significantly to the flux (L_comp/L_Be~0.3). Spectral line mismatches further suggest a hydrogen-poor, CNO-processed atmosphere, consistent with a stripped-envelope star. HD 698 thus adds to the emerging class of Be+bloated OB binaries, capturing a brief post-mass-transfer phase when the donor remains spectroscopically detectable prior to the subdwarf stage.",

Given their substantially larger dataset including radial velocity measurements, which are not available in our analysis, we are withdrawing to incorporate additional observations and ensure the integrity of our results before resubmission Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present the first detailed photometric characterization of TIC 470127886, a previously unstudied multi-periodic variable star discovered in TESS photometry. Analysis of 145,374 high-cadence observations spanning 696 days (944-day baseline, 2023 January-2024 October) across 10 sectors (60, 59, 58, 53, 52, 73, 86, 79, 78, 85) reveals complex periodic variability with a primary period of 5.544527 +/- 0.004307 days and false alarm probability 1.47 x 10^-87. Lomb-Scargle analysis identifies three significant periods at 5.545, 5.801, and 8.874 days with amplitudes of 15,702, 12,772, and 12,670 ppm. The phase-folded light curve shows smooth, sinusoidal morphology consistent with ellipsoidal variation from tidal distortion in a close binary, with no eclipse features. A three-component sinusoidal model, appropriate for ellipsoidal variables, provides excellent fit quality. Validation tests confirm signal authenticity and persistence, and systematic checks verify no contamination from nearby stars (>3 mag fainter). We classify TIC 470127886 as an ellipsoidal variable candidate with 0.70 confidence, with multi-period behavior suggesting additional variability mechanisms beyond tidal distortion. This work demonstrates high-precision characterization of complex multi-periodic variables in TESS photometry.",

However, the dynamics of interchange reconnection in the low corona might be more complex than recognized before in higher temporal and spatial resolutions. Using unprecedentedly high-resolution observations from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) onboard the Solar Orbiter, we analyze the dynamics of interchange reconnection in a small-scale fan-spine-like topology. Interchange reconnection that continuously occurs around the multi-null points of the fan-spine-like system exhibits a quasi-periodicity of ~200 s, nearly covering the entire evolution of this system. Continuous evolution and reversal of multiple current sheets are observed over time near the null point. These results reveal that the dynamics of interchange reconnection are likely modulated by the emerging magnetic structures, such as mini-filaments and emerging arcades. Moreover, a curtain-like feature with a width of 1.7 Mm is also observed near the interchange reconnection region and persistently generates outflows, which is similar to the separatrix curtain reported in the pseudo-streamer structure. This study not only demonstrates the complex and variable reconnection dynamics of interchange reconnection within small-scale fan-spine topology but also provides insights into the self-similarity of magnetic field configurations across multiple temporal and spatial scales.",

Leisawitz Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) A plethora of astronomical science cases can only be achieved with high angular resolution observations, and we can expect the number of these to grow as astronomers are constrained by the size limitations of single-aperture space telescopes, making space-based interferometry inevitable. However, the enabling technologies do not have flight heritage at the system level, and the concept remains immature to much of the community, meaning no direct-detection synthetic-aperture space-based interferometer has yet flown and an opportunity exists for the UK to take a world leading role. Here we propose the SPace-based InterFerometry Feasibility (SPIFF) Project as a program to address both issues simultaneously by: 1) completing a thorough survey of the science cases across the EM spectrum that would directly benefit from, or be impossible without, space-based interferometry; 2) down selecting key requirements via a Science Traceability Matrix mapping exercise; 3) host a workshop for the UK astronomical community to consolidate these findings; 4) build a technology demonstration mission to raise TRL and achieve flight heritage of critical technologies. Such a program positions the UK as the partner of choice for any future NASA or ESA space-based interferometry mission, allowing the UK to lead groundbreaking scientific discoveries, while also directly benefiting the UK industrial base by advancing domestic exportable technologies and building direct synergy with other UK space priorities. Indeed, the UK is uniquely positioned to lead in space-based interferometry, possessing a rare trifecta of domestic strengths: world-class expertise in ground-based interferometry and space-based instrumentation; commercial entities developing mission-critical technologies; and scientists whose research spans the full range of science cases that would benefit directly from space-based interferometry.",

CubeSats are compact and cost-effective satellite platforms that have emerged as versatile tools for scientific exploration and technology demonstrations in space. NUTEx is an imaging telescope operating in the 200-300 nm wavelength range, intended for deployment on a micro-satellite bus. The optical system is based on a Ritchey Chretien (RC) telescope configuration, featuring a 146 mm primary mirror. The detector is a photon-counting microchannel plate (MCP) device with a solar-blind photocathode, paired with an in-house developed readout unit. The instrument has a wide field of view (FoV) of 4 deg, a peak effective area of approximately 18 sq cm at 260 nm, and can reach a sensitivity of 21 AB magnitude (SNR = 5) in a 200 second exposure. The primary scientific objective of NUTEx is to monitor the night sky for transient phenomena, such as supernova remnants, flaring M-dwarf stars, and other short-timescale events. The payload is currently scheduled for launch in Q2 2026. This paper presents the NUTEx instrument design, outlines its scientific goals and capabilities, and provides an overview of the electronics and mechanical subsystems, including structural analysis.",

Jow, Ue-Li Pen Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Current pulsar timing array (PTA) analyses do not take full advantage of pulsar distance information, thereby missing out on improved angular resolution and on a potential factor-of-two gain in detection sensitivity for individual gravitational-wave (GW) sources. In this work, we investigate the impact of precise pulsar distance measurements on angular resolution as an extension to previous work measuring the angular resolution of a dense, isotropic PTA [Jow et al., 2025]. We present a coherent map-making technique that utilizes precise pulsar distance measurements to reach the diffraction-limited resolution of an individual source: $\\delta \\theta_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\sim (1/\\mathrm{SNR})(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{GW}}/r) \\approx 2~\\mathrm{arcmin}$, where the SNR refers to the detection strength of the source. With this level of angular resolution, identifying an EM counterpart may become feasible, enabling multi-messenger follow-up. We show that for $\\rm SNR=10$, which may be the current sensitivity level using a coherent analysis, the diffraction limit is reached with roughly 9 pulsars. Moreover, angular resolution scales sharply with the number of known pulsar distances as $\\sim (1/\\mathrm{SNR})^{N_{\\mathrm{dist}}/2}$. Thus, each additional pulsar with high signal-to-noise timing and precise distance measurement can improve PTA resolution by an order of magnitude. The distance to the best-timed millisecond pulsar (PSR J0437$-$4715) is already constrained to sub-parsec levels. We argue, therefore, that a coherent analysis of PTA data, fully incorporating pulsar distance information, is timely.",

It is therefore urgent that, as astronomers, we collectively work to protect the Earth, allowing future generations the opportunity to continue to uncover the secrets of the cosmos.

Motivated by this, we propose the Eschatian Hypothesis: that the first confirmed detection of an extraterrestrial technological civilization is most likely to be an atypical example, one that is unusually \"loud\" (i.e., producing an anomalously strong technosignature), and plausibly in a transitory, unstable, or even terminal phase. Using a toy model, we derive conditions under which such loud civilizations dominate detections, finding for example that if a society is loud for only $10^{-6}$ of its lifetime, it must emit ${\\gtrsim}1$% of its total observable energy budget during that phase to outrun quieter populations. The hypothesis naturally motivates agnostic anomaly searches in wide-field, multi-channel, continuous surveys as a practical strategy for a first detection of extraterrestrial technology.",

Arenberg, Chris Stark, Blake Shepherd, Victoria S. Meadows, Aki Roberge, Tyler D. Robinson, Robert Podgurski Accepted for Publication in SPIE JATIS Special Section: \"Habitable Worlds Observatory Pre-Formulation Science, Architecture Concepts, and Technology Maturation\" Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) A large space-based telescope aimed at detecting and characterizing the atmospheres of Earth-like planets orbiting Sun-like stars will require unprecedented contrast and stability. However, damage to the primary mirror due to micrometeoroid impacts will provide a stochastic, time-dependent source of stray light in the coronagraph's field of view that could significantly lengthen exposure times and reduce the expected science yield. To better quantify the impact of stray light and inform the Habitable Worlds Observatory mission design process, we present estimates of stray light in different micrometeoroid damage scenarios for a broad range of targets, and use that to find the expected decrease in science yield (i.e., the expected number of detected exoEarth candidates). We find that stray light due to micrometeoroid damage may significantly reduce yield, by 30% -- 60% in some cases, but significant uncertainties remain due to the unknown maximum expected impactor energy, and the relationship between impact energy and expected crater size. Micrometeoroid damage therefore needs further exploration, as it has the potential to reduce scientific yield, and in turn drive the development of mitigation strategies, selection of telescope designs, and selection of observing priorities in the future.",

Nevertheless, a robust statistical analysis can be performed to enable the estimation and testing of angular power spectral models for the SGWB without specifying distributional assumptions. Here, the technical aspects of the method are discussed in detail. Moreover, a new, consistent estimator for the covariance of the angular power spectrum is derived. The proposed approach is applied to data from the third observing run (O3) of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo.",

Dillon, Kartik Mandar, Zachary E. Martinot, Robert Pascua, Piyanat Kittiwisit, James E. Aguirre 20 pages, 8 figures, Published to RASTI Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The detection and characterization of the 21cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) demands extraordinary precision in radio interferometric observations and analysis. For modern low-frequency arrays, achieving the dynamic range necessary to detect this signal requires simulation frameworks to validate analysis techniques and characterize systematic effects. However, the computational expense of direct visibility calculations grows rapidly with sky model complexity and array size, posing a potential bottleneck for scalable forward modeling. In this paper, we present fftvis, a high-performance visibility simulator built on the Flatiron Non-Uniform Fast-Fourier Transform (finufft) algorithm. We show that fftvis matches the well-validated matvis simulator to near numerical precision while delivering substantial runtime reductions, up to two orders of magnitude for dense, many-element arrays. We provide a detailed description of the fftvis algorithm and benchmark its computational performance, memory footprint, and numerical accuracy against matvis, including a validation study against analytic solutions for diffuse sky models. We further assess the utility of fftvis in validating 21cm analysis pipelines through a study of the dynamic range in simulated delay and fringe-rate spectra. Our results establish fftvis as a fast, precise, and scalable simulation tool for 21cm cosmology experiments, enabling end-to-end validation of analysis pipelines.",

Patru Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) GRAVITY+ improves by orders of magnitude the sensitivity, sky-coverage and contrast of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). A central part of this project is the development of Gravity Plus Adaptive Optics (GPAO), a dedicated high-order and laser-guide star Adaptive Optics (AO) system for VLTI. GPAO consists of four state-of-the-art AO systems equipping all 8m-class Unit Telescopes (UTs) for the wavefront correction of the VLTI instruments. It offers both visible and infrared Natural Guide Star (NGS) and Laser Guide Star (LGS) operations. The paper presents the design, operations and performances of GPAO. We illustrate the improvement brought by GPAO with interferometric observations obtained during the commissioning of the NGS mode end-2024. These science results include the first optical interferometry observations of a redshift $z\\sim4$ quasar, the spectroscopy of a cool brown-dwarf with magnitude $K\\sim 21.0$, the first observations of a Class I young star with GRAVITY, and the first sub-micro arcsecond differential astrometry in the optical. Together with the entire GRAVITY+ project, the implementation of GPAO is a true paradigm shift for observing the optical Universe at very high angular resolution.",

John Tomsick submitted to ApJ the 23th of october 2025 Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a Compton telescope designed to survey the 0.2 - 5 MeV sky, consisting of a compact array of cross-strip germanium detectors. It is planned to be launched in 2027 into an equatorial low-Earth (530 km) orbit with a prime mission duration of 2 years. The observation of MeV gamma rays is dominated by background, mostly from extragalactic and atmospheric photon but also from the activation of the detector materials induced by cosmic-ray interactions. Thus, background simulation and identification are crucial for the data analysis. In this work we perform Monte Carlo simulations of the background for the first 3 months in orbit, and we extrapolate the results to 2 years in orbit, in order to determine the build-up of the activation due to long-lived isotopes. We determine the rates of events induced by the background that are reconstructed as Compton events in the simulated COSI data. We find that the extragalactic background photons dominate at low energies (<660 keV), while delayed activation from cosmic-ray primaries (proton/alpha) and albedo photons dominate at higher energies. As part of this work, a comparison at low latitude (<1 deg) between recent measurement of the SAA by the High-Energy Particle Detector (HEPD-01) on board the China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES-01) and the AP9/AE9 model has been made, showing an overestimation of the flux by a factor 9 by the model. The systematic uncertainties associated with these components are quantified. This work marks a major step forward in estimating and understanding the expected background rates for the COSI satellite mission.",

We present key individual software contributors, their affiliated institutes and countries of high-impact software in astronomy & astrophysics. We consider the number of citations to papers using the software and the number of person-days from their git repositories, as proxies for impact and complexity, respectively. We find that half of the mapped development is through US-affiliated institutes, and a large number of high-impact projects are led by a single person.

Catalogs and code available at this https URL Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We re-examine the expected yield of Gaia astrometric planet detections using updated models for giant-planet occurrence, the local stellar population, and Gaia's demonstrated astrometric precision. Our analysis combines a semi-analytic model that clarifies key scaling relations with more realistic Monte Carlo simulations. We predict $7{,}500 \\pm 2{,}100$ planet discoveries in the 5-year dataset (DR4) and $120{,}000 \\pm 22{,}000$ over the full 10-year mission (DR5), with the dominant error arising from uncertainties in giant-planet occurrence. We evaluate the sensitivity of these forecasts to the detection threshold and the desired precision for measurements of planet masses and orbital parameters. Roughly $1{,}900 \\pm 540$ planets in DR4 and $38{,}000 \\pm 7{,}300$ planets in DR5 should have masses and orbital periods determined to better than $20$%. Most detections will be super-Jupiters ($3$ - $13 M_{\\rm J}$) on $2$ - $5$AU orbits around GKM-type stars ($0.4$ - $1.3 M_\\odot$) within $500$ pc. Unresolved binary stars will lead to spurious planet detections, but we estimate that genuine planets will outnumber them by a factor of $5$ or more. An exception is planets around M-dwarfs with $a < 1$AU, for which the false-positive rate is expected to be about $50$%.

While liquid argon and liquid xenon TPCs have been extensively employed in the field of direct dark matter detection, successful development of LHe TPCs has not yet been achieved. Launched in 2020, our project has made significant progress since then. These advancements have convinced us that a single-phase LHe TPC is technologically feasible. Compared to liquid xenon and liquid argon TPCs, one of the unique challenges for LHe TPCs is event overlap caused by the 13-second lifetime scintillation. We will demonstrate that this overlap can be entirely mitigated when the LHe temperature is maintained near 1.0 K. At this temperature, electron mobility is three orders of magnitude higher than at approximately 4.0 K, which is the temperature we initially proposed for the LHe TPC.",

TOI-2267 hosts two Earth-sized planets (TOI-2267 b, $1.00\\pm0.11 R_{\\oplus}$, and TOI-2267 c, $1.14\\pm0.13 R_{\\oplus}$, if orbiting the primary star; or $1.22\\pm0.29 R_{\\oplus}$ and $1.36\\pm0.33 R_{\\oplus}$, respectively, if orbiting the secondary star) with orbital periods of 2.3 and 3.5 days. This system also contains a third Earth-sized planet candidate with an orbital period of 2.0 days that was previously identified as a likely planet with a low false-positive probability, but could not be firmly validated due to the lack of independent observations beyond TESS data. We combine two new transit observations from the 5.1m Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory with archival TESS data and high-resolution imaging to statistically validate the planetary nature of TOI-2267 d ($0.98\\pm0.09 R_{\\oplus}$ if orbiting the primary star, or $1.77\\pm0.43 R_{\\oplus}$ if orbiting the secondary star) using the updated TRICERATOPS+ pipeline. We attempt to determine the host star for TOI-2267 d using transit shape stellar density analysis, but are unable to conclusively assign a host. Our validation of TOI-2267 d suggests that TOI-2267 is either the first known double transiting M dwarf binary system, or hosts three planets in an extremely compact orbital configuration.",

Jose, Liton Majumdar Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal; 28 pages, 8 figures, and 8 tables Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The search for potentially habitable exoplanets centers on detecting biosignature molecules in Earth-like atmospheres, which makes it essential to understand their detectability under biologically and geologically influenced conditions. In this study, we model the reflection and thermal emission spectra of such atmospheres across the UV/VIS/NIR and mid-IR regions and simulate their detectability with future mission concepts such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) and the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE). We employ Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model data, based on Earth's atmosphere, to derive temperature pressure profiles and couple them with a 1D photochemical model to assess the detectability of these molecules in Earth analogs located 10 parsecs away. We investigate the dominant reaction pathways and their contributions to the atmospheric composition of an Earth analog, with a focus on how they shape the resulting molecular signatures. We also examine the role of surface boundary conditions, which indirectly trace the effects of biological and geological processes, on the detectability of these molecules using HWO- and LIFE-type mission concepts. Our findings indicate that O3 is detectable with both mission concepts, while H2O requires specific surface humidity levels for detection with LIFE and shows only potential detectability with HWO. CO2 is detectable with LIFE. Both N2O and CH4 require continuous surface outgassing for potential detection with LIFE, and CH4 further requires low surface humidity to prevent masking by water features. Our work highlights the feasibility of characterizing the atmospheres of Earth analogs in the UV/VIS/NIR and mid-IR domains using HWO- and LIFE-type mission concepts and offers guidance for the development of future missions operating in these spectral regions.",

Formulation Pierre Auclair-Desrotour, Mohammad Farhat, Gwenaël Boué, Jacques Laskar 17 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph) Atmospheric thermal tides arise from the diurnal contrast in stellar irradiation. They exert a significant influence on the long-term rotational evolution of rocky planets because they can accelerate the planetary spin, thereby counteracting the decelerating effect of classical gravitational tides. Consequently, equilibrium tide-locked states may emerge, as exemplified by Venus and hypothesised for Precambrian Earth. Quantifying the atmospheric thermal torque and elucidating its dependence on tidal frequency -- both in the low- and high-frequency regimes -- is therefore essential. In particular, we focus here on the resonance that affected early Earth, which is associated with a forced Lamb wave. Within the framework of linear theory, we develop a new analytical model of the atmospheric response to both gravitational an thermal tidal forcings for two representative vertical temperature profiles that bracket the atmospheres of rocky planets: (i) an isothermal profile (uniform temperature) and (ii) an isentropic profile (uniform potential temperature). Dissipative processes are incorporated via Newtonian cooling. We demonstrate that the isothermal and isentropic cases are governed by the same general closed-form solution, and we derive explicit expressions for the three-dimensional tidal fields (pressure, temperature, density and wind velocities) throughout the spherical atmospheric shell. These results constitute the foundation for two forthcoming papers, in which analytical formulae for the thermotidal torque will be presented and compared with numerical solutions obtained from General Circulation Models (GCMs).",

Accepted for publication in MNRAS Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The leading hypothesis for the origin of the Moon, that of a single giant impact, faces significant challenges. These include either the need for an impactor with a near-identical composition to Earth or an extremely high-mass or high-energy impact to achieve near-complete material mixing. In this paper we explore an alternative, the \"multiple impact hypothesis\", which relaxes the compositional constraints on both the target and projectile, and allows for the consideration of more probable, less extreme impacts that steadily grow the Earth and Moon to their current size over several impact events. Using the hydrodynamical code SWIFT, we simulate \"chains\" of impacts and follow the growth of a moon around a planet analogous to our own. Our results demonstrate that chains of three or more impacts can produce systems comparable to the Earth-Moon system whilst achieving higher compositional similarities than the canonical giant impact scenario. This presents the multiple impact hypothesis as a promising alternative to the single large impact scenario for the origin of the Moon.",

Turner Paper published in Nature Astronomy at this https URL. This preprint is the original submitted version before peer-review Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Recent transit observations of K2-18b and TOI-270d revealed strong molecular absorption signatures, lending credence to the idea that temperate sub-Neptunes (T$_\\mathrm{eq}$=250-400K) have upper atmospheres mostly free of aerosols. These observations also indicated higher-than-expected CO$_2$ abundances on both planets, implying bulk compositions with high water mass fractions. However, it remains unclear whether these findings hold true for all temperate sub-Neptunes. Here, we present the JWST NIRSpec/PRISM 0.7-5.4$\\mathbf{\\mu}$m transmission spectrum of a third temperate sub-Neptune, the 2.4R$_\\oplus$ planet LP 791-18c (T$_\\mathrm{eq}$=355K), which is even more favorable for atmospheric characterization thanks to its small M6 host star. Intriguingly, despite LP 791-18c's radius, mass, and equilibrium temperature being in between those of K2-18b and TOI-270d, we find a drastically different transmission spectrum. While we also detect methane on LP 791-18c, its transit spectrum is dominated by strong haze scattering and there is no discernible CO$_2$ absorption. Overall, we infer a deep metal-enriched atmosphere (246-415$\\times$solar) for LP 791-18c, with a CO$_2$-to-CH$_4$ ratio smaller than 0.07 (at 2$\\sigma$), indicating less H$_2$O in the deep envelope of LP 791-18c and implying a relatively dry formation inside the water ice-line. These results show that sub-Neptunes that are near-analogues in density and temperature can show drastically different aerosols and envelope chemistry, and are intrinsically diverse beyond a simple temperature dependence.",

We examine two acoustic wave (AW) modes with periods of 11 minutes (AW1) and 5.5 minutes (AW2) propagating from 100 to 320 km altitude using a radial molecular kinetics model. The wave-driven heating was reduced by 40-56% with cycle-averaged temperature gradient $\\langle dT/dr \\rangle$ decreasing from 9.4 K per scale height H0 to 5.6 K/H$_0$ for AW1 and from 4.4 K/H$_0$ to 1.9 K/H$_0$ for AW2 when accounting for planetary curvature. While the growth in wave density amplitude was attenuated for the 1D radial geometry as well, the heating differences are more pronounced, with both effects driven by geometric spreading accumulating as waves propagate into increasingly rarefied regions. These findings suggest that accounting for curvature effects is crucial when conducting DSMC estimates of acoustic wave contributions to thermospheric heating and atmospheric escape, as Cartesian-based derived counterparts may be overestimated by factors of 1.7-2.3 for these frequencies.",

Sharma, Varun Sheel, Martin Pätzold Space Physics (physics.space-ph); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Venus, in the absence of an intrinsic magnetic field, undergoes a direct interaction between its ionosphere and the solar wind. Previous missions, including Mariner, Venera, and the Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO), reported a recurring localized increase in electron density, often termed a \"bulge,\" at altitudes between 160 and 200 km. This study investigates this topside bulge using over 200 dayside electron density profiles derived from the Venus Radio Science experiment (VeRa) onboard the Venus Express (VEX). We employ an automated, gradient-based classification algorithm to provide a quantitative and reproducible method for identifying and categorizing the bulge morphology into three types. Type 1 profiles exhibit a distinct secondary peak above the main V2 layer. Type 2 profiles display a shoulder-like feature near the bulge altitude. Type 3 bulges are not visually apparent but can be identified through residuals obtained after subtracting a Chapman layer fit to the V2 peak. The bulge is detected in over 80\\% of the analyzed profiles, with a higher occurrence during periods of low solar activity and at lower solar zenith angles (SZA). Type 1 morphologies are only observed at low latitudes (within $\\pm 40^\\circ$). The peak altitude of the bulge negatively correlates with SZA, suggesting that thermospheric cooling toward the terminator significantly influences the bulge altitude. The occurrence patterns and morphological characteristics indicate that the bulge is likely influenced by external drivers, such as solar wind interaction, rather than being solely a result of local photochemical processes.",

By more than doubling the sample of saturnian irregular moon orbits, including pushing to smaller sizes, we can now see finer detail in their orbital distribution. We note the emergence of potential subgroups associated with each of Siarnaq and Kiviuq within the Inuit group. We find that in the inclination range 157-172 degrees the ratio of smaller moons (diameters less than 4 km) to larger moons (diameters greater than 4 km) is significantly larger than that of any other inclination range in the retrogrades. We denote this subset of the Norse group as the Mundilfari subgroup after its largest member. The incredibly steep slope of the Mundilfari subgroup's size distribution, with a differential power law index of q = 6, strengthens the hypothesis in Ashton et al.

We introduce a new dynamic model to describe the forms of the striae observed in comets Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1), West (C/1975 V1), and Seki-Lines (C/1962 C1). Charged particles made of refractory materials, with radii less than 0.5micrometer, are expelled from the comet's nucleus and accelerated by Lorentz forces near the nucleus. These particles decay many times to form striae, which have a lifespan of less than about 100 days at a distance of 1 astronomical unit from the sun. Over time, they continue to decay and eventually disappear from view. The following dynamic model explains these material science processes. Particles expelled from the comet's nucleus are subjected to three forces: solar gravity, solar radiation pressure, and Lorentz forces near the nucleus. As these particles decrease in size, the Lorentz forces and radiation pressure cause fluctuations, increasing and decreasing to form striae. This model, which is less of a dynamic approximation than previous theories (FLM3), explains the structure of the striae, enables predictions of their luminosity, and clarifies their origin.",
