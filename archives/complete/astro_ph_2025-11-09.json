      "abstract": "Density reconstruction from biased tracers: Testing the equivalence principle through consistency relations Lawrence Dam, Omar Darwish Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Consistency relations of large-scale structure offer a unique and powerful test of the weak equivalence principle (EP) on cosmological scales. If the EP is violated, different tracers will undergo different accelerations in response to a uniform gravitational field, and this loss of universality manifests as a dipole with a characteristic $1/K$ scale dependence in the squeezed limit of the bispectrum. In this work we show that such a violation can be identified with a particular anti-symmetric {modulation} in the local cross-power spectrum of distinct tracers. Based on this observation, we propose to test the EP using quadratic estimators as a more practical alternative to the conventional approach of directly estimating the bispectrum. We apply our quadratic estimator to a DESI-like survey and forecast constraints on the overall amplitude of EP violation. Including mildly nonlinear scales in our reconstruction ($k_\\mathrm{max}\\simeq0.15\\, h\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), we find that our estimator is competitive with the more exhaustive direct bispectrum approach. This means surveys like DESI can already benefit from the quadratic estimator approach.",

Unlike GW signals, non-stationary noise can appear in both the GW-signal quadrature and the orthogonal quadrature, which is usually not measured. Simultaneous sensing of this orthogonal quadrature provides a witness channel that can be used to reconstruct the disturbance in the signal quadrature enabling a subtraction of non-stationary noise. Here, we present the concept of quadrature witness that is compatible with frequency-dependent squeezing, which is already used to simultaneously reduce photon shot noise and photon radiation pressure noise. We demonstrate that implementing this approach in a GW detector could reduce noise caused by loud back-scatter events, thereby improving the overall sensitivity and robustness of GW observatories.",

Chechetkin Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The appearance and specific properties of the structures in the local Universe are studied by means of the Vlasov kinetic technique. The role of the cosmological constant in the local structure formation is considered via the theorem on the general function satisfying the identity of the gravity of sphere and of point mass. Then, the Hubble tension is naturally explained as a result of two flows, local and global one, with non-coinciding Hubble parameters. The linearized Vlasov-Poisson equation with the cosmological term is shown to lead to van Kampen's waves, of Landau damping and then to aperiodic structures. The aperiodicity thus is emerging as a intrinsic feature of the filamentary and void structure of the local Universe, revealing the self-consistent field mechanism of its formation. The damping of the aperiodicity then is predicted and can be observationally traced upon the increase of the scale of the filaments.",

Kobayashi, Kazunori Kohri Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) In this paper, we explain the recently reported a nHz-band gravitational-wave background from NANOGrav 15-year through the merger of binary super-massive black holes with masses of $10^9 M_{\\odot}$ formed by the growth of primordial black holes. When a primordial black hole accretes at a high accretion rate, it emits a large number of high-energy photons. These heat the plasma, causing high-redshift cosmological 21cm line emission. Since this has not been detected, there is a strict upper bound on the accretion rate. We have found that with the primordial black hole abundance $10^{-14} \\lesssim f_{\\rm PBH} \\lesssim 10^{-12}$ and the mass $1 M_{\\odot} \\lesssim m_{\\rm PBH} \\lesssim 10^3 M_{\\odot}$, we successfully fit the nHz band gravitational wave background from NANOGrav 15-year while avoiding the 21 cm line emission.

However, these methods are limited by observational uncertainties arising from multiple unknown and periodic physical effects, which substantially complicate subsequent data analysis. To mitigate these issues and improve data fidelity, we propose the Artificial Pulsar Polarization Arrays (APPA): a satellite network comprising multiple pulsed signal transmitters and a dedicated receiver satellite. In order to constrain the axion-photon coupling parameter $g_{a\\gamma}$, we generate simulated observations using Monte Carlo methods to investigate APPA's sensitivity via two complementary approaches: Bayesian analysis and frequentist analysis.

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We demonstrate that the properties of eccentric gravitational wave (GW) signals enhance the detectability of GW phase shifts caused by environmental effects (EEs): The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEs can be boosted by up to $\\ell_{\\rm max}^{1 - n}$ with respect to corresponding circular signals, where $\\ell_{\\rm max}$ is the highest modeled eccentric GW harmonic and $n$ is the frequency scaling of the GW dephasing prescription associated to the EE. We investigate the impact on a population level, adopting plausible eccentricity distributions for binary sources observed by LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (A+ and A\\# sensitivities), as well as Cosmic Explorer (CE) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). For sources in the high eccentricity tail of a distribution ($e \\gtrsim 0.2$ at 10 Hz), phase shifts can systematically be up to $\\ell_{\\rm max}^{1 - n}$ times smaller than in a corresponding circular signal and still be detectable. For typical EEs, such as Roemer delays and gas drag, this effect amounts to SNR enhancements that range from $10^2$ up to $10^5$. For CE and ET, our analysis shows that EEs will be an ubiquitous feature in the eccentric tail of merging binaries, regardless of the specific details of the formation channel. Additionally, we find that the joint analysis of eccentricity and phase shift is already plausible in current catalogs if a fraction of binaries merge in AGN migration traps.",

When analyzed in the context of General Relativity (GR), the latest DESI data favor a dynamical dark energy (DDE) equation of state, $w(z)$, that crosses the phantom divide line $w=-1$. However, this framework prefers a lower Hubble constant, $H_0$, than Planck 2018, thereby worsening the tension with local measurements. This phantom crossing is a key feature that cannot be achieved by minimally coupled scalar fields (quintessence) within GR. This suggests the need for a new degree of freedom that can simultaneously: (A) increase the best-fit value of $H_0$ in the context of the DESI DR2 data, and (B) allow the crossing of the $w=-1$ line within a new theoretical approach. We argue that both of these goals may be achieved in the context of Modified Gravity (MG), and in particular, Scalar-Tensor (ST) theories, where phantom crossing is a natural and viable feature. We demonstrate these facts by analyzing a joint dataset including DESI DR2, Pantheon+, CMB, and growth-rate (RSD) data in the context of simple parametrizations for the effective gravitational constant, $\\mu_G(z) \\equiv G_{eff}/G_N$, and the DDE equation of state, $w(z)$. This MG framework significantly alleviates the tension, leading to a higher inferred value of $H_0 = 70.6 \\pm 1.7 \\, \\text{km s}^{-1} \\text{Mpc}^{-1}$. We also present a systematic, data-driven reconstruction of the required underlying ST Lagrangian and provide simple, generic analytical expressions for both the non-minimal coupling $F(\\Phi) = 1+\\xi\\Phi^{2}e^{n\\Phi}$ and the scalar potential $U(\\Phi) = U_{0}+ae^{b\\Phi^{2}}$, which well-describe the reconstructed functions.",

As a first step, we implement the linearized dark energy stress-energy tensor and scalar field equations, providing the groundwork for a future full Horndeski theory extension. We validate KGB-evolution by comparing its power spectra against linear predictions from hi$\\_$class, finding excellent agreement on large scales at low redshifts and over all scales at high redshifts. We demonstrate that nonlinear growth of matter and metric perturbations on small scales drives the linearized dark energy field into a nonlinear clustering regime, which in turn feeds back on the growth of cosmic structure. In contrast to the $k$-essence limit, a nonzero braiding considerably amplifies this backreaction, producing a significantly stronger alteration of structure formation in the kinetic gravity braiding model.",

Studying neutron stars both in isolation, with X-ray measurements and pulse profiling, and in dynamic events, such as neutron star mergers, have provided insight into these high nuclear densities. Though nominally congruent, here we highlight impact of implicit assumptions embedded in joint analysis of these messengers and their systematic impact on EoS inference. We show that astrophysical assumptions and EoS framework can have a larger effect on inferred EoS than individual contemporary neutron star observations. Performing a proof-of-concept demonstration using the chronologically first few observational constraints, after the application of 5 to 6 observational constraints, additional observations provided diminishing returns and modified the inferred EoS by shifting the radius of a 1.4 $\\unit{M_\\odot}$ NS by $\\sim$ 0.1 km. By contrast, astrophysical priors, specifically the spin and mass ratio motivated by astrophysical source population uncertainties, and EoS framework tend to impact EoS inference much more substantially by shifting the 1.4 $\\unit{M_\\odot}$ NS radius by $\\sim$ 0.5 km and by modifying shape of inferred mass-radius relationship. The inferred EoS depends strongly on the adopted choice of spectral parameterizations: when we employ a framework which explicitly enforces causality, we find a strong phase-transition-like feature at $\\sim 10^{14.5}$ g cm$^{-3}$.",

They alter the local propagation of light in a significant way if the ratio of spacetime curvature to the non-minimal coupling is of order one. Spacetime curvature can become appreciable around black holes, and yet the effect of non-minimal couplings on electromagnetic observations of black holes remains underexplored. A particular feature of the non-minimal coupling between the electromagnetic field-strength and the Riemann tensor is that it generates two distinct photon rings for different polarizations. Working within the paradigm of lensing bands and focusing on the $n = 1$ lensing band, we illustrate by which diagnostics a modified light propagation may be distinguished from a modified spacetime geometry and how constraints on the value of the non-minimal coupling can be obtained",

However, all galaxy catalogs are incomplete, i.e. they only include a subset of all galaxies, typically being biased towards the bright end of the luminosity distribution. This sub-selection systematically affects the dark siren inference of the Hubble constant $H_0$, so a completeness relation has to be introduced that accounts for the missing objects. In the literature it is standard to assume that the missing galaxies are uniformly distributed across the sky and that the galaxy magnitude distribution is known. In this work we develop a novel method which improves upon these assumptions and reconstructs the underlying true galaxy field, respecting the spatial correlation of galaxies on large scales. In our method the true magnitude distribution of galaxies is inferred alongside the spatial galaxy distribution. Our method results in an improved three-dimensional prior in redshift and sky position for the host galaxy of a GW event, which is expected to make the resulting $H_0$ posterior more robust. Building on our previous work, we make a number of improvements, and validate our method on simulated data based on the Millennium simulation.

      "abstract": "Revealing Hidden Cosmic Flows through the Zone of Avoidance with Deep Learning Alexandra Dupuy, Donghui Jeong, Sungwook E. Hong, Ho Seong Hwang, Juhan Kim, Hélène M. Courtois 20 pages, 15 figures, 1 interactive figure available online on Sketchfab, accepted for publication in ApJ Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present a refined deep-learning-based method to reconstruct the three-dimensional dark matter density, gravitational potential, and peculiar velocity fields in the Zone of Avoidance (ZOA), a region near the galactic plane with limited observational data. Using a convolutional neural network (V-Net) trained on A-SIM simulation data, our approach reconstructs density or potential fields from galaxy positions and radial peculiar velocities. The full 3D peculiar velocity field is then derived from the reconstructed potential. We validate the method with mocks that mimic the spatial distribution of the Cosmicflows-4 (CF4) catalog and apply it to actual data. Given CF4's significant observational uncertainties and since our model does not yet account for them, we use peculiar velocities corrected via an existing Hamiltonian Monte Carlo reconstruction, rather than raw catalog distances. Our results demonstrate that the reconstructed density field recovers known galaxy clusters detected in an H \\textsc{i} survey of the ZOA, despite this dataset not being used in the reconstruction. This agreement underscores the potential of our method to reveal structures in data-sparse regions. Most notably, streamline convergence and watershed analysis identify a mass concentration consistent with the Great Attractor, at $(l, b) = (308.4^\\circ \\pm 2.4^\\circ, 29.0^\\circ \\pm 1.9^\\circ)$ and $cz = 4960.1 \\pm 404.4,{\\rm km/s}$, for 64\\% of realizations. Our method is particularly valuable as it does not rely on data point density, enabling accurate reconstruction in data-sparse regions and offering strong potential for future surveys with more extensive galaxy datasets.",

Using Jiutian simulations, we construct a mock galaxy catalog to $z=3$ covering 100 deg$^2$, which incorporates the instrumental and observational effects of the CSST. We divide the galaxy sample into seven photometric-redshift (photo-$z$) tomographic bins and identify 2D voids within each bin using the Voronoi tessellation and watershed algorithm. We measure the angular cross-power spectrum between the void distribution and the weak lensing signal, and estimate the covariance matrix via jackknife resampling combined with pseudo-$C_{\\ell}$ approach to account for the partial sky correction. We employ the Halo Void Dust Model (HVDM) to model the void-matter cross-power spectrum and adopt the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique to implement the constraints on the cosmological and void parameters. We find that our method can accurately extract the cosmological information, and the constraint accuracies of some cosmological parameters from the void-lensing analysis are comparable or even tighter than the weak lensing only case. This demonstrates that the void-lensing serves as an effective cosmological probe and a valuable complement to galaxy photometric surveys, particularly for the Stage-IV surveys targeting the high-redshift Universe.",

Photometry Sayed Shafaat Mahmud, Adiba Amira Siddiqa, Cosmin Ilie 12 pages, 6 figures, submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The formation of the first stars in the universe could be significantly impacted by the effects of Dark Matter (DM). Namely, if DM is in the form of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), it could lead to the formation (at $z\\sim 25-10$) of stars that are powered by DM annihilations alone, i.e. Dark Stars (DSs). Those objects can grow to become supermassive ($M\\sim 10^6 \\Msun$) and shine as bright as a galaxy ($L\\sim 10^8 \\Msun)$. Using a simple $\\chi^2$ minimization, the first three DSs photometric candidates (i.e. \\JADESeleven, \\JADEStwelve, and \\JADESzthirteen) were identified by \\cite{Ilie:2023JADES}. Our goal is to develop tools to streamline the identification of such candidates within the rather large publicly available high redshift JWST data sets. We present here the key first step in achieving this goal: the development and implementation of a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) search for Dark Star candidates, using data from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) photometric catalog. Our method reconfirms JADES-GS-z13 and JADES-GS-z11 as dark star candidates, based on the chi-squared goodness of fit test, yet they are $\\sim10^4$ times faster than the Neadler-Mead $\\chi^2$ minimization method used in \\cite{Ilie:2023JADES}. We further identify six {\\it new photometric} Dark Star candidates across redshifts $z \\sim 9$ to $z \\sim 14$. These findings underscore the power of neural networks in modeling non-linear relationships and efficiently analyzing large-scale photometric surveys, advancing the search for Dark Stars.",

Submitted to ApJ Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) A key task in cosmology is to test the validity of general relativity (GR) at cosmological scales and, therefore, to distinguish between dark energy and modified gravity (MG) as the driver of the late-time cosmic acceleration. The decay rate ($DR$) of cosmological gravitational potential, being sensitive to gravity and being immune to various astrophysical uncertainties, enables GR tests independent to other structure growth probes. Recently we have measured $DR$ at $0.2\\leq z\\leq 1.4$, combining the DR9 galaxy catalog from the DESI imaging surveys and Planck cosmic microwave background maps \\citep{arXiv:2411.12594}. Here we use this measurement to test gravity, and restrict the analysis to one-parameter extensions to the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We consider four one-parameter MG parameterizations. One is $f(a)=\\Omega_m^\\gamma(a)$. The other three adopt the gravitational slip parameter $\\eta=1$ and consider variations in the effective gravitational constant $G_{\\rm eff}/G$ with the parameterization $\\Sigma(a)=\\Sigma_\\Lambda \\Omega_\\Lambda(a)/\\Omega_\\Lambda$, $\\Sigma(a)=\\Sigma_1 a$ or $\\Sigma(a)=\\Sigma_2 a^2$. We find $\\gamma=0.47^{+0.22}_{-0.15}$, consistent with the GR prediction $\\gamma\\simeq 0.55$. We also find $\\Sigma_\\Lambda=0.018^{+0.052}_{-0.053}$, $\\Sigma_1=0.020^{+0.065}_{-0.062}$, and $\\Sigma_2=0.027^{+0.067}_{-0.069}$, fully consistent with the GR case of $\\Sigma=0$, regardless of parameterizations of $\\Sigma(a)$. The constraining power is already competitive, while a factor of 2 further improvement is expected for the upcoming full-sky galaxy surveys.",

Intriguingly, the data favor a transition of the dark energy equation of state across $w=-1$, a hallmark of the Quintom scenario. In this paper, we consider a different approach to the dynamical nature of dark energy by investigating its interaction with ordinary matters, specifically the Chern-Simons (CS) interaction with photons. In cosmology, this interaction rotates the polarized plane of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons, which induces non-zero polarized TB and EB power spectra. We forecast this measurement with the Ali CMB Polarization Telescope (AliCPT) experiment. We take the best-fit value of the isotropic rotation angle from Planck data as our fiducial input. We project that 11 module-year (modyr) of observations will yield an improved detection sensitivity with a significance $\\sim 5\\sigma$, given a calibration precision of $0.1^\\circ$ in the polarization angle. We also forecast AliCPT's sensitivity to the amplitude of a scale invariant spectrum of the anisotropic polarization rotation field. With $50$~modyr of observations, the large-aperture configuration is expected to reach $\\sigma_{A_{\\mathrm{CB}}}\\sim10^{-2}$, offering a sixfold improvement over the small-aperture design and enabling competitive tests of spatial fluctuations in the dark energy field.",

      "abstract": "Parameterizing Noise Covariance in Maximum-Likelihood Component Separation Goureesankar Sathyanathan, Josquin Errard, Soumen Basak Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We introduce a noise-aware extension to the parametric maximum-likelihood framework for component separation by modeling correlated $1/f^\\alpha$ noise as a harmonic-space power law. This approach addresses a key limitation of existing implementations, for which a mismodelling of the statistical properties of the noise can lead to biases in the characterization of the spectral laws, and consequently biases in the recovered CMB maps. We propose a novel framework based on a modified ridge likelihood embedded in an ensemble-average pipeline and derive an analytic bias correction to control noise-induced foreground residuals. We discuss the practical applications of this approach in the absence of true noise information, leading to the choice of white noise as a realistic assumption. As a proof of concept, we apply this methodology to a set of simplified, idealized simulations inspired by the specifications of the proposed ECHO (CMB-Bh$\\overline{a}$rat) mission, which features multi-frequency, large-format focal planes. We forecast the $95 \\%$ upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r_{95}$, under a suite of realistic noise scenarios. Our results show that for an optimistic full sky observation, ECHO can achieve $r_{95}\\leq 10^{-4}$ even in the presence of significant correlated noise, demonstrating the mission's capability to probe primordial gravitational waves with unprecedented sensitivity. Without degrading the statistical performance of the traditional component separation, this methodology offers a robust path toward next-generation B-mode searches and informs instrument design by quantifying the impact of noise correlations on cosmological parameter recovery.",

To address this, we release $\\texttt{unimpeded}$, a publicly available Python library and data repository providing pre-computed nested sampling and MCMC chains. We apply this resource to conduct a systematic analysis across a grid of eight cosmological models, including $\\Lambda$CDM and seven extensions, and 39 datasets, including individual probes and their pairwise combinations. Our model comparison reveals that whilst individual datasets show varied preferences for model extensions, the base $\\Lambda$CDM model is most frequently preferred in combined analyses, with the general trend suggesting that evidence for new physics is diluted when probes are combined. Using five complementary statistics, we quantify tensions, finding the most significant to be between DES and Planck (3.57$\\sigma$) and SH0ES and Planck (3.27$\\sigma$) within $\\Lambda$CDM. We characterise the $S_8$ tension as high-dimensional ($d_G=6.62$) and resolvable in extended models, whereas the Hubble tension is low-dimensional and persists across the model space.

Tucker (DES Collaboration) 38 pages, 14 figures, submitted Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Machine Learning (cs.LG) Data-driven approaches using deep learning are emerging as powerful techniques to extract non-Gaussian information from cosmological large-scale structure. This work presents the first simulation-based inference (SBI) pipeline that combines weak lensing and galaxy clustering maps in a realistic Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) configuration and serves as preparation for a forthcoming analysis of the survey data. We develop a scalable forward model based on the CosmoGridV1 suite of N-body simulations to generate over one million self-consistent mock realizations of DES Y3 at the map level. Leveraging this large dataset, we train deep graph convolutional neural networks on the full survey footprint in spherical geometry to learn low-dimensional features that approximately maximize mutual information with target parameters. These learned compressions enable neural density estimation of the implicit likelihood via normalizing flows in a ten-dimensional parameter space spanning cosmological $w$CDM, intrinsic alignment, and linear galaxy bias parameters, while marginalizing over baryonic, photometric redshift, and shear bias nuisances. To ensure robustness, we extensively validate our inference pipeline using synthetic observations derived from both systematic contaminations in our forward model and independent Buzzard galaxy catalogs. Our forecasts yield significant improvements in cosmological parameter constraints, achieving $2-3\\times$ higher figures of merit in the $\\Omega_m - S_8$ plane relative to our implementation of baseline two-point statistics and effectively breaking parameter degeneracies through probe combination. These results demonstrate the potential of SBI analyses powered by deep learning for upcoming Stage-IV wide-field imaging surveys.",

Spectroscopy Adiba Amira Siddiqa, Sayed Shafaat Mahmud, Cosmin Ilie 9 pages, 4 figures, submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Some of the first stars in the Universe might be powered by Dark Matter (DM) annihilations, rather than nuclear fusion. Those objects, i.e. Dark stars (DS), offer a unique window into understanding DM via the observational study of the formation and evolution of the first stars and their Black Hole (BH) remnants. In \\cite{NNSMDSPhot} (Paper~I) we introduced a feedforward neural network (FFNN) trained on synthetic DS photometry in order to detect and characterize dark star {\\it photometric} candidates in the early universe based on data taken with the NIRCam instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In this work we develop a FFNN trained on synthetic DS spectra in order to identify {\\it spectroscopic} dark star candidates in the data taken with JWST's NIRSpec instrument. In order to validate our FFNN model we apply it to real data for the four spectroscopic Supermassive Dark Star (SMDS) candidates recently identified in \\cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar} and reconfirm that indeed \\JADESeleven, \\JADESzthirteen, \\JADESfz, and \\JADESfo have spectra that are consistent with those of Supermassive Dark Stars. The main advantage of our FFNN model, in comparison to the Nedleaer-Mead Monte Carlo parameter estimator used in \\cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}, is that the approach introduced here predicts parameters in milliseconds, over 10,000 times faster than the traditional method used in \\cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}. With this in mind, the FFNN model we developed and validated in this work will be adapted for Bayesian uncertainty analyses and automatic analyses of NIRSpec publicly available data for high redshift objects. This study establishes a robust and efficient tool for probing Dark Stars and understanding their role in cosmic evolution.",

In this study, we present a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations targeting high-redshift ($z \\geq 10$) galaxies with dark matter halo masses in the range $10^{10} - 10^{11}\\ {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ at $z=10$, using state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulation codes (Enzo, Ramses, Changa, Gadget-3, Gadget-4, and Gizmo). This study aims to evaluate the convergence of the participating codes and their reproducibility of high-redshift galaxies with the galaxy formation model calibrated at relatively low redshift, without additional physics for high-redshift environments. The subgrid physics follows the AGORA CosmoRun framework, with adjustments to resolution and initial conditions to emulate similar physical environments in the early universe. The participating codes show consistent results for key galaxy properties (e.g., stellar mass), but also reveal notable differences (e.g., metallicity), indicating that galaxy properties at high redshifts are highly sensitive to the feedback implementation of the simulation. Massive halos (${\\rm M}_{\\rm halo}\\geq5\\times10^{10}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ at $z=10$) succeed in reproducing observed stellar masses, metallicities, and UV luminosities at $10\\leq z\\leq12$ without requiring additional subgrid physics, but tend to underpredict those properties at higher redshift. We also find that varying the dust-to-metal ratio modestly affects UV luminosity of simulated galaxies, whereas the absence of dust significantly enhances it. In future work, higher-resolution simulations will be conducted to better understand the formation and evolution of galaxies at Cosmic Dawn.",

Zitrin 26 pages, 9 figures, 11 tables, published in A&A Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The strongly lensed Supernova (SN) Encore at a redshift of $z = 1.949$, discovered behind the galaxy cluster MACS J0138$-$2155 at $z=0.336$, provides a rare opportunity for time-delay cosmography and studies of the SN host galaxy, where previously another SN, called SN Requiem, had appeared. To enable these studies, we combine new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging, archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, and new Very Large Telescope (VLT) spectroscopic data to construct state-of-the-art lens mass models that are composed of cluster dark-matter (DM) halos and galaxies. We determine the photometric and structural parameters of the galaxies across six JWST and five HST filters. We use the color-magnitude and color-color relations of spectroscopically-confirmed cluster members to select additional cluster members, identifying a total of 84 galaxies belonging to the galaxy cluster. We construct seven different mass models using a variety of DM halo mass profiles, and explore both multi-plane and approximate single-plane lens models. As constraints, we use the observed positions of 23 multiple images from eight multiply lensed sources at four distinct spectroscopic redshifts. In addition, we use stellar velocity dispersion measurements to obtain priors on the galaxy mass distributions. We find that six of the seven models fit well to the observed image positions. Mass models with cored-isothermal DM profiles fit well to the observations, whereas the mass model with a Navarro-Frenk-White cluster DM profile has an image-position $\\chi^2$ value that is four times higher. We build our ultimate model by combining four multi-lens-plane mass models and predict the image positions and magnifications of SN Encore and SN Requiem. Our work lays the foundation for building state-of-the-art mass models of the cluster for future cosmological analysis and SN host galaxy studies.",

D 112, 083548 (2025) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Scalar dark matter is a viable alternative to particle dark matter models such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPS). This is particularly the case for scalars with a low mass $m \\gtrsim 10^{-21} {\\rm eV}$ as required to make quantum effects macroscopic on galactic scales. We point out that by synchronising the measurements of arrival times of pairs of pulsars, Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA) could probe ultralight dark matter (ULDM) scenarios with a mass $10^{-23} {\\rm eV}\\lesssim m \\lesssim 10^{-19} {\\rm eV}$ that is greater than the one reached in standard analysis. The upper limit on the mass $m$ is set by the time lag $\\Delta t$ between the observations of the two pulsars and could be pushed above $10^{-19} {\\rm eV}$ for $\\Delta t$ smaller than one hour. However, for these high scalar masses only very high density dark matter clouds could be detected and the capture rate of neutron stars is too low to provide sufficient statistics. Significant detection probabilities would thus require direct dark-matter-baryon interactions that favor the formation of neutron stars within such dark matter clouds, or the discovery of black hole/pulsar binary systems, taking advantage of the dark matter spike generated by the black hole.",

It is well known that spatial gradient terms lead to a failure of this approximation, particularly at the transition from slow-roll to ultra-slow-roll phase.

Interestingly, while the homogeneous solution for $\\Pi$ accurately captures the dynamics across the first transition, it is the homogeneous solution for ${\\cal R}$ that becomes valid across the second. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the spatial curvature term introduced in the extended $\\delta N$ formalism of \\cite{Artigas:2024ajh} can be interpreted as arising from the contribution of $\\Pi$ to the energy density perturbation.

We use the largest simulation run in the hydrodynamic MillenniumTNG project. By stacking haloes in bins of halo mass, redshift, mass-dependent properties such as peak height and concentration, and halo formation history, we measure the shape of the logarithmic slope of the density profile of dark matter haloes. Our results show that the splashback depth has a strong dependence on the halo mass which follows a power law $\\mathcal{D}\\propto\\left(\\log_{10}M\\right)^{2.8}$. Properties with strong correlation with halo mass demonstrate similar dependence. The splashback width has the strongest dependence on halo peak height and follows a power law $\\mathcal{W}\\propto\\nu^{-0.87}$. We provide the fitting functions of the splashback depth and width in terms of halo mass, redshift, peak height, concentrations and halo formation time. The depth and width are therefore considered to be a long term memory tracker of haloes since they depend more on accumulative physical properties, e.g., halo mass, peak height and halo formation time. They are shaped primarily by the halo's assembly history, which exerts a stronger influence on the inner density profile than short-term dynamical processes. In contrast, the splashback features have little dependence on the short term factors such as halo mass accretion rate and most recent major merger time. The splashback depth and width can therefore be used to complement information gained from quantities like the point of steepest slope or truncation radius to characterise the halo's history and inner structure.",

Due to their short durations and cosmological distances, their dispersion measure (DM) - redshift ($z$) relation is useful for constraining cosmological parameters and detecting the baryons in the Universe. The increasing number of localized FRBs in recent years has provided more precise constraints on these parameters. However, the larger dataset reveals limitations in the widely used probability density function ($p_{\\rm diff}$) for ${\\rm DM}_{\\rm diff}$, which refers to the diffuse electron term of FRB DM. In this project, we collect 117 of the latest, localized FRBs, discuss the effect of a more accurate $\\sigma_{\\rm diff}$, which is a parameter in $p_{\\rm diff}$ and once thoughts as ``effective standard deviation'', and more clearly rewrite their likelihood to better constrain the parameters above. We find that the widely used approximation $\\sigma_{\\rm diff} \\sim F/\\sqrt{z}$ only works under contrived assumptions and shows the greatest deviation from the true standard deviation in low redshift. In general, one should use an accurate method to derive this parameter from $p_{\\rm diff}$.

Revised version with minor changes after addressing the (ApJ) reviewer's comments Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The peak model of structure formation was built more than fifty years ago with the aim to address the origin of dark matter halo rotation in the tidal torque theory (TTT). Paradoxically, it has allowed one to explain and reproduce all halo properties found in cosmological simulations except their rotation, which remains to be understood. With the present two Papers we remedy this anomaly. In Paper I we derived the angular momentum (AM) of protohalos centered on triaxial peaks of suited scale, taking into account that, to leading order, their density profile is smooth and homogeneous. Here we use that result to derive the AM of these objects, accounting for the fact that their actual density profile is slightly outward decreasing and lumpy so that they do not collapse monolithically at once, but progressively from inside out, undergoing mergers during the process. By monitoring in detail their resulting mass and AM growth, we characterize the spin distribution of final halos and the precise mass and radial distribution of their inner mean specific AM. The results obtained explain and reproduce the rotational properties of simulated halos.",

PyFowl code is available at this https URL Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We analyze the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 data using predictions from the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS). Specifically, we fit three two-point observables (3$\\times$2pt), galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and cosmic shear, using the one-loop expressions for the projected angular correlation functions. We validate our pipeline against numerical simulations and we check for several internal consistencies before applying it to the observational data. Fixing the spectral tilt and the baryons abundance, we measure $S_8=0.833\\pm 0.032$, $\\Omega_m = 0.272\\pm 0.022$, and $h = 0.773\\pm 0.049$, to about $3.8\\%$, $8.1\\%$, and $6.3\\%$, at $68\\%$CL, respectively. Our results are consistent at the $\\sim 1.5-2\\sigma$ level with those from Planck and the BOSS full-shape analyses, as well as with those from DES collaboration 3$\\times$2pt analysis combined with a Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis prior and a Planck prior on $n_s$. The shift in the posterior compared to DES collaboration results highlights the impact of modeling, scale cuts, and choice of prior. The theory code and likelihood used for our analyses, \\texttt{PyFowl}, is made publicly available.",

Werk, Yi Zhang 21 pages, 18 figures, accepted in MNRAS, DPMhalo software available via this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We develop and present the Descriptive Parametric Model (DPM), a tool for generating profiles of gaseous halos (pressure, electron density, and metallicity) as functions of radius, halo mass, and redshift. The model assumes single-phase, spherically symmetric, volume-filling warm/hot gas. The DPM framework enables mock observations of the circumgalactic medium (CGM), group halos, and clusters across a number of wavebands including X-ray, sub-millimeter/millimeter, radio, and ultraviolet (UV). We introduce three model families calibrated to reproduce cluster profiles while having different extrapolations to the CGM -- (i) self-similar halos, (ii) a reduced gas model for lower halo masses, and (iii) a model with shallower radial slopes at lower masses. We demonstrate how our z=0.0-0.6 models perform when applied to stacked and individual X-ray emission profiles, measurements of the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect, electron dispersion measures from fast radio bursts, O VI absorption, and UV-derived pressures. Our investigation supports models that remove baryons from halos more effectively and have shallower profiles at lower halo mass. We discuss biases and systematics when modelling observables using consistent hot gaseous halo models for all wavebands explored. We release the DPMhalo code to encourage the use of our framework and new formulations in future investigations. Included with the DPMhalo distribution is a set of recent observations that allow the reproduction of most plots in this paper.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Imaging of optical Galactic cirrus, the spatially resolved form of diffuse Galactic light, provides important insights into the properties of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) in the Milky Way. While previous investigations have focused mainly on the intensity characteristics of optical cirrus, their morphological properties remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employ several complementary statistical approaches -- local intensity statistics, angular power spectrum / $\\Delta$-variance analysis, and Wavelet Scattering Transform analysis -- to characterize the morphology of cirrus in deep optical imaging data. We place our investigation of optical cirrus into a multi-wavelength context by comparing the morphology of cirrus seen with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array to that seen with space-based facilities working at longer wavelengths (Herschel 250 $\\mu m$, WISE 12$\\mu m$, and Planck radiance), as well as with structures seen in the DHIGLS HI column density map. Our statistical methods quantify the similarities and the differences of cirrus morphology in all these datasets. The morphology of cirrus at visible wavelengths resembles that of far-infrared cirrus more closely than that of mid-infrared cirrus; on small scales, anisotropies in the cosmic infrared background and systematics may lead to differences. Across all dust tracers, cirrus morphology can be well described by a power spectrum with a common power-law index $\\gamma\\sim-2.9$. We demonstrate quantitatively that optical cirrus exhibits filamentary, coherent structures across a broad range of angular scales. Our results offer promising avenues for linking the analysis of coherent structures in optical cirrus to the underlying physical processes in the ISM that shape them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these morphological signatures can be leveraged to distinguish and disentangle cirrus from extragalactic light.",

V2 fixed typo in title Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The first Euclid Quick Data Release contains millions of galaxies with excellent optical and near-infrared (IR) coverage. To complement this dataset, we investigate the average far-IR properties of Euclid-selected main sequence (MS) galaxies using existing Herschel and SCUBA-2 data. We use 17.6deg$^2$ (2.4deg$^2$) of overlapping Herschel (SCUBA-2) data, containing 2.6 million (240000) MS galaxies. We bin the Euclid catalogue by stellar mass and photometric redshift and perform a stacking analysis following SimStack, which takes into account galaxy clustering and bin-to-bin correlations. We detect stacked far-IR flux densities across a significant fraction of the bins. We fit modified blackbody spectral energy distributions in each bin and derive mean dust temperatures, dust masses, and star-formation rates (SFRs). We find similar mean SFRs compared to the Euclid catalogue, and we show that the average dust-to-stellar mass ratios decreased from z$\\simeq$1 to the present day. Average dust temperatures are largely independent of stellar mass and are well-described by the function $T_2+(T_1-T_2){\\rm e}^{-t/\\tau}$, where $t$ is the age of the Universe, $T_1=79.7\\pm7.4$K, $T_2=23.2\\pm0.1$K, and $\\tau=1.6\\pm0.1$Gyr. We argue that since the dust temperatures are converging to a non-zero value below $z=1$, the dust is now primarily heated by the existing cooler and older stellar population, as opposed to hot young stars in star-forming regions at higher redshift. We show that since the dust temperatures are independent of stellar mass, the correlation between dust temperature and SFR depends on stellar mass. Lastly, we estimate the contribution of the Euclid catalogue to the cosmic IR background (CIB), finding that it accounts for >60% of the CIB at 250, 350, and 500$\\mu$m. Forthcoming Euclid data will extend these results to higher redshifts, lower stellar masses, and recover more of the CIB.",

      "abstract": "Photon Orbit Signatures in Spectra of Black Hole Accretion Disks Daniel C. M. Palumbo, George N. Wong, Angelo Ricarte 8 pages, 5 figures, accepted to ApJL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Light orbiting an accreting black hole may impact the disk or jet multiple times before escaping to the observer, at a variety of angles with respect to the local magnetic field. In this letter, we characterize the imprints of these long path lengths and disparate magnetic field impacts in synchrotron spectra of hot accretion disks, as the strongly lensed ``photon ring'' exhibits a higher synchrotron turnover frequency in each lensed sub-image. We apply tools of varying complexity: first, we develop a minimal, unlensed one-zone model that isolates the first two sub-images of the accretion flow. By varying the magnetic field geometry encountered by each sub-image, we show that distinctive spectral signatures emerge in both total intensity and fractional linear polarization. Second, we examine a semi-analytic radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model, in which we find that there is generally a frequency at which the first indirect image outshines the direct image even in total flux density. Lastly, we demonstrate that even general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation snapshots show this spectral character. We find a typical correction to the unresolved spectrum of order $10\\%$ near the turnover frequency that grows with increasing viewing inclination, growing to order unity at higher frequencies. We predict sensitive spectral studies of the cores of Messier 87* and Sagittarius A* at frequencies exceeding $300$ GHz to constrain the existence of the photon ring even without imaging, with prospects for photon ring detection even in other sources with unresolved shadows.",

Karthik Yadavalli, Qinan Wang High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) In this paper, we first present observations of SN~2024acyl, a normal Type Ibn supernova with a large projected offset ($\\sim$35~kpc) from its host galaxy. The low star-formation rate measured at the explosion site raises the possibility that the progenitor of SN~2024acyl may not have been a massive star. We then examine, more broadly, the spectral diversity of Type Ibn supernovae around 20--35 days after peak brightness and identify two distinct groups: Group I, which shows bluer rest-frame optical color and narrower He~I emission lines; and Group II, which shows redder rest-frame optical color and broader He~I lines. Group~I also tends to show higher peak luminosities. The diversity we identify appears to be closely connected to the diversity observed around peak and to persist into late phases ($>80$ days after peak). Given its redder color and broader He~I lines, we classify SN~2024acyl as belonging to Group II. Based on the current dataset, we find no clear connection between this spectral diversity and either the host environments of Type Ibn SNe or their pre-explosion activity. The observed diversity in Type Ibn SNe likely reflects differences in circumstellar material properties and/or explosion energetics. These differences could result from a range of progenitor properties, such as different helium star mass, orbital period and companion type if they are in binary systems, and may indicate fundamentally diverse progenitors. Whether a continuous distribution exists between the two groups remains to be determined and will require further data to explore.",

Study of head-tail galaxies provides us with fruitful insights into the mechanisms of shock waves and turbulence, as well as magnetic-field amplification and cosmic-ray acceleration. A recent MeerKAT observation revealed that a head-tail galaxy in the galaxy cluster, Abell 3322, exhibits a peculiar ``Omega\" structure in its shape. In this paper, we investigated this Omega-tail galaxy using the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). We found that the southern jet tends to be brighter than the northern jet, with a brightness ratio of about 2. This can be attributed to Doppler boost and the inclination of the jets. Our broadband data suggest that the radio spectrum becomes steeper along the jet propagation direction, and the cosmic-ray aging model with a weak reacceleration of cosmic rays is preferable to explain the index profile. We further found a gradient of the spectral index perpendicular to the jet propagation. We discussed the origin of the gradient and suggested that a shock wave along one side of the jets is present. The resultant ram pressure as well as the backflow made at the early stage of the jet may produce the tail component of this Omega-tail galaxy, while the observed Omega-shape structure is more likely due to a twin vortex seen in the low Reynolds number flow.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of certain BL Lac objects (BL Lacs) exhibit an additional hard $\\gamma$-ray component in the TeV energy range that surpasses the predictions of the one-zone leptonic jet model. The origin of this excess emission remains unclear. In this study, we selected five BL Lacs whose SEDs display a very hard intrinsic spectrum in the TeV band and successfully reproduced their broadband SEDs using a two-zone lepto-hadronic model. Within this framework, the emission observed in the optical, X-ray, GeV $\\gamma$-ray, and sub-TeV $\\gamma$-ray bands is modeled using the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton radiation processes of the relativistic electrons in the jets. Meanwhile, the TeV excess is attributed to $\\gamma$-ray emission resulting from the photomeson ($p\\gamma$) process via $\\pi^0$ decay occurring within advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). This scenario requires a hard proton spectrum with a spectral index of $p \\sim 1.6-1.7$ and a cutoff energy ranging from 30 to 90 TeV, as well as a relatively large ADAF radius. Such hard proton spectra suggest that the dominant acceleration mechanisms are likely magnetic reconnection and/or stochastic acceleration processes within ADAFs. Additionally, the emission from the cascaded electrons results in a bump in the keV--MeV band; however, it is overwhelmed by the jet emission. Although the hadronuclear ($pp$) process cannot be entirely ruled out, it would necessitate an even harder proton spectrum and a higher cutoff energy compared to the $p\\gamma$ process, making it a less favorable explanation for the observed TeV excess.",

Determining its physical origin is key to mapping accretion geometry but remains unresolved. We perform a novel phase-resolved analysis on a newly discovered quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the active galactic nucleus 1ES 1927+654. For the first time in a supermassive black hole (SMBH), we detect a unique `U'-shaped QPO lag-energy spectrum and observe coronal spectral variability over the QPO phase. We find that the QPO is adequately explained by plasma resonant oscillations within a corona. Modeling of QPO spectral properties and reverberation mapping reveal that the corona is contracting and confined to only a few gravitational radii regions near the SMBH, consistent with theoretical predictions for a decreasing QPO period of near 10 minutes. These results present the first observational evidence for an oscillating and contracting compact corona around an SMBH.",

Kavanagh Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Thanks to a recent observation with XMM-Newton, we discovered periodic pulsations at P= 9.6652 +/- 0.0002 s in a new ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) in the galaxy NGC 4631. This source, dubbed as X-8, shows one of the largest spin-up rates ever observed, dP/dt = (-9.6 +/- 0.5)*1E-8 s/s. These findings indicate that the compact object is a neutron star, and X-8 is a new member of the pulsating ULX class. The 0.3-10 keV luminosity of X-8 is ~3.4E39 erg/s, and its X-ray spectrum can be described by an absorbed disk blackbody or a cut-off power law, similar to what is observed in other pulsating ULXs. We discuss two possible causes for the large spin-up rate: Doppler shift from orbital motion of the neutron star and intrinsic spin-up due to accretion torque. This new ULX pulsar adds a key source to the small known population, and will enable future studies to better constrain the physical mechanisms responsible for their super-Eddington luminosities.",

The temporal and the spectral properties of this component do not appear compatible with the extrapolation of the beamed blazar-like emission of the inner, pc-scale jet. We explore the possibility that the VHE component is produced in the jet at kpc scale through the inverse Compton emission of a population of ultra-high energy electrons (with Lorentz factor $\\gamma\\sim 10^8$). In the model these electrons are accelerated through the shear acceleration mechanism, and they also account for the still puzzling X-ray emission of knots detected by {\\it Chandra} in the large-scale jets of several powerful quasars (including 3C273). In our scenario the VHE component can be interpreted as the integrated emission from the two brightest knots of the 3C273 jet. We speculate that the decay of the emission on the timescale of $\\sim 3$ years could be accounted for by the scenario if the VHE radiation is produced in some compact regions in the downstream flow of a recollimation shock.",

Recent MHD simulations suggest that these structures play an important role in particle transport and acceleration; however, MHD is inapplicable in most of our Universe, where the plasma is so hot or diffuse that Coulomb collisions are negligible. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the intermittent properties of collisionless large-amplitude turbulence in electron-positron plasmas via fully kinetic 3D simulations, exploring a wide range of $\\delta B / B_0$ and scale separations between the turbulence driving scale, $L$, and kinetic scales, $c/\\omega_{\\rm p}$. The steady-state collisionless turbulence in our simulations broadly resembles that of MHD, but the development of pressure anisotropy steepens the scaling between magnetic field strength, $B$, and scalar field-line curvature, $K_\\parallel$ -- yielding $B \\propto K_\\parallel^{-3/4}$ -- and consequently modifies the power-law slope of the probability density function of $K_\\parallel$; this slope hardens from $K_\\parallel^{-2.5}$ to $K_\\parallel^{-2.0}$ as $\\delta B / B_0$ increases from 4 to 140. Pressure anisotropy also triggers mirror and firehose instabilities, with the volume-filling fractions of these fluctuations increasing with $\\delta B / B_0$; for our largest $\\delta B / B_0$, $20\\%$ of the volume is mirror-unstable and $6\\%$ is firehose-unstable. Both the curvature and the Larmor-scale fluctuations in collisionless large-amplitude turbulence are expected to significantly influence cosmic ray transport and acceleration in the interstellar medium of our Galaxy and the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters.",

Lin Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Stars embedded in the inner pc region of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) experience extreme accretion conditions that significantly alter their evolution. We present one-dimensional MESA simulations of stars growing and decaying within AGN disks, implementing radiative-feedback-regulated accretion which limits stellar growth near the Eddington luminosity, as well as wind-driven mass loss. Unlike stand-alone stars in the field, these embedded stars follow unique evolutionary tracks with well-determined mass evolution and chemical yields. We distinguish two regimes: ``immortal\" stars that indefinitely remain on the main sequence due to efficient hydrogen mixing; and ``metamorphic\" stars that evolves off the main sequence, ultimately enriching the disk with heavy elements upon hydrogen and helium exhaustion in their cores. Results indicate that embedded stars in AGN disks can attain large masses, but gas retention and limited mixing likely render the ``immortal\" track unsustainable. We show radiative feedback plays a critical role in preventing runaway growth, since it regulates the inflow to at most of order-unity the Eddington-limited mass-loss rate. Embedded metamorphic stars significantly enrich AGN disks with helium and $\\alpha$-elements, potentially explaining the observed high metallicity in broad-line regions (BLR) without excessive helium enrichment. This study underscores the critical interplay between stellar feedback and accretion physics in shaping the stellar populations and chemical evolution within AGN disks.",

Here, we present a deep neural network that can reconstruct the main neutrino properties of interest from the raw waveforms recorded by the radio antennas: the neutrino direction, the energy of the particle shower induced by the neutrino interaction, and the event topology, thereby estimating the neutrino flavor. For the first time, we predict the full posterior PDF for the energy and direction reconstruction via neural posterior estimation utilizing conditional normalizing flows, enabling event-by-event uncertainty prediction. We improve over previous reconstruction algorithms and obtain a median resolution of 0.30 log(E) and 18 square degrees for a 'shallow' detector component and 0.08 log(E) and 28 square degrees for a 'deep' detector component for neutral current (NC) events at a shower energy of 1 EeV. This deep learning approach also allows us to reconstruct the more stochastic $\\nu_e$ - charged current (CC) events.

The octupole-order perturbation on the inner binary from the tertiary can induce extreme eccentricities and cause orbital flips of the binary, but short-range forces such as those due to General Relativity (GR) may suppress extreme eccentricity excitations. In this paper, we consider restricted hierarchical three-body systems, where the inner binary has a test-mass component. We investigate the maximum possible eccentricity (called \"limiting eccentricity\") attainable by the inner binary under the influence of the tertiary perturbations and GR effect. In systems with sufficiently high hierarchy, the double averaging (DA) model is a good approximation; we show that the orbits which can flip under the octupole-order perturbation reach the same limiting eccentricity, which can be calculated analytically using the quadrupole-order Hamiltonian. In systems with moderate hierarchy, DA breaks down and the so-called Brown Hamiltonian is often introduced as a correction term; we show that this does not change the limiting eccentricity. Finally, we employ the single averaging (SA) model and find that the limiting eccentricity in the SA model is higher than the one in the DA model. We derive an analytical scaling for the modified limiting eccentricity in the SA model.",

It rises to an absolute magnitude peak of about -17.58 mag in 10.6 days, and displays a rapid linear post-peak light-curve decline in all bands, similar to most SNe Ibn. The optical pseudobolometric light curve peaks at ($3.5\\pm0.8) \\times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with a total radiated energy of $(5.0\\pm0.4) \\times 10^{48}$ erg. The spectra are dominated by a blue continuum at early stages, with narrow P-Cygni \\Hei~lines and flash-ionisation emission lines of C {\\sc iii}, N {\\sc iii}, and He {\\sc ii}. The P-Cygni \\Hei~features gradually evolve and become emission-dominated in late-time spectra. The \\Ha~line is detected throughout the entire spectral evolution, which indicates that the CSM is helium-rich with some residual amount of H. Our multiband light-curve modelling yields estimates of the ejecta mass of $M_{ej}$ = $0.98^{+0.30}_{-0.20} \\, \\msun$, with a kinetic energy of $E_{k} = 0.13^{+0.03}_{-0.02} \\times 10^{51}$ erg, and a $^{56}Ni$ mass of $M_{\\mathrm{Ni}} = 0.017 \\, \\msun$. The inferred CSM properties are characterised by a mass of $M_{\\rm{CSM}} = 0.39^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ \\msun, an inner radius of $R_0$=$15.6^{+1.9}_{-2.0}$ AU, and a density $\\rho_{CSM} = (1.32\\pm0.22)\\times10^{-11} \\, \\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-3}}$. The multi-epoch spectra are well reproduced by the CMFGEN/ \\texttt{he4p0} model, corresponding to a He-ZAMS mass of 4~M$_\\odot$. These findings are consistent with a scenario of an SN powered by ejecta-CSM interaction, originating from a low-mass helium star that evolved within an interacting binary system where the CSM with some residual hydrogen may originate from the mass-transfer process. In addition, a channel of core-collapse explosion of a late-type Wolf-Rayet star with H, or an Ofpe/WN9 star with fallback accretion, cannot be entirely ruled out.",

Lett. 132 (2024) 021001 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We show, for the first time, radio measurements of the depth of shower maximum ($X_\\text{max}$) of air showers induced by cosmic rays that are compared to measurements of the established fluorescence method at the same location. Using measurements at the Pierre Auger Observatory we show full compatibility between our radio and the previously published fluorescence data set, and between a subset of air showers observed simultaneously with both radio and fluorescence techniques, a measurement setup unique to the Pierre Auger Observatory. Furthermore, we show radio $X_\\text{max}$ resolution as a function of energy and demonstrate the ability to make competitive high-resolution $X_\\text{max}$ measurements with even a sparse radio array. With this, we show that the radio technique is capable of cosmic-ray mass composition studies, both at Auger and at other experiments.",

Dobre High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA), part of the Pierre Auger Observatory, is currently the largest array of radio antenna stations deployed for the detection of cosmic rays, spanning an area of $17$ km$^2$ with 153 radio stations. It detects the radio emission of extensive air showers produced by cosmic rays in the $30-80$ MHz band. Here, we report the AERA measurements of the depth of the shower maximum ($X_\\text{max}$), a probe for mass composition, at cosmic-ray energies between $10^{17.5}$ to $10^{18.8}$ eV, which show agreement with earlier measurements with the fluorescence technique at the Pierre Auger Observatory. We show advancements in the method for radio $X_\\text{max}$ reconstruction by comparison to dedicated sets of CORSIKA/CoREAS air-shower simulations, including steps of reconstruction-bias identification and correction, which is of particular importance for irregular or sparse radio arrays. Using the largest set of radio air-shower measurements to date, we show the radio $X_\\text{max}$ resolution as a function of energy, reaching a resolution better than $15$ g cm$^{-2}$ at the highest energies, demonstrating that radio $X_\\text{max}$ measurements are competitive with the established high-precision fluorescence technique. In addition, we developed a procedure for performing an extensive data-driven study of systematic uncertainties, including the effects of acceptance bias, reconstruction bias, and the investigation of possible residual biases. These results have been cross-checked with air showers measured independently with both the radio and fluorescence techniques, a setup unique to the Pierre Auger Observatory.",

Payne Updated to reflect the version published in Science Advances High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present the class of extreme nuclear transients (ENTs), including the most energetic single transient yet discovered, Gaia18cdj. Each ENT is coincident with its host-galaxy nucleus and exhibits a smooth ($<$$10$% excess variability), luminous ($2\\times$$10^{45}$ to $7\\times$$10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$), and long-lived ($>$$150$ days) flare. ENTs are extremely rare ($\\geq$$1$$\\times$$10^{-3}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$) compared to any other known class of transients. They are at least twice as energetic ($0.5\\times10^{53}$ to $2.5\\times10^{53}$ erg) as any other known transient, ruling out supernova origins. Instead, the high peak luminosities, long flare timescales, and immense radiated energies of the ENTs are most consistent with the tidal disruption of high-mass ($\\gtrsim$$3$ M$_{\\odot}$) stars by massive ($\\gtrsim$$10^8$ M$_{\\odot}$) supermassive black holes (SMBHs). ENTs will be visible to high redshifts ($z\\sim4$ to $6$) in upcoming surveys, providing an avenue to study the high-mass end of the SMBH mass distribution, complementing recent studies of actively accreting SMBHs at high redshifts with the James Webb Space Telescope.",

Timing analyses reveal type-B and type-C Quasi-periodic Oscillations across different spectral states, often associated with episodic radio ejections. Broadband ($0.7-60$ keV) spectral modeling, employing disc, Comptonization, and reflection components, reveals degeneracies in constraining disc-corona geometries. Polarimetric measurements in $2-8$ keV band detect significant polarization degrees (PDs) ranging from $3-20.6\\%$ ($1.2-21.4\\%$) in harder (softer) states, with moderate to strong energy dependence, except for LMC X$-1$, Swift J$151857.0-572147$, and MAXI J1744$-$294, where no significant polarization is detected. We report polarization detections of Cyg X$-3$ (PD $\\sim 21.4\\%$, SIMS), LMC X$-3$ (PD $\\sim 2.4\\%$, HSS) and IGR J$17091-3624$ (PD $\\sim 9\\%$, LHS) using recent {\\it IXPE} observations. A positive correlation is found between PD and Comptonized photon fraction ($cov_{\\rm frac}$), while an anti-correlation is observed with disc-to-Comptonized flux ratio ($F_{\\rm ratio}$) across spectral states. Combined timing, spectral, and polarimetric results, together with constraints from radio jet observations, suggest a radially extended corona within a truncated disc for Cyg X$-1$, Swift J$1727.8-1613$, IGR J$17091-3624$, and GX $339-4$, whereas the disc-corona geometry remains poorly constrained for 4U $1957+115$, LMC X$-3$, and 4U $1630-47$. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding accretion geometries and highlight prospects for future X-ray polarimetric studies.",

Prochaska, S. D. Ryder, R. M. Shannon, N. Tejos, A. G. Mannings Accepted for publication to PASA. 19 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Impulsive radio signals such as fast radio bursts (FRBs) are imprinted with the signatures of multi-path propagation through ionised media in the form of frequency-dependent temporal broadening of the pulse profile (scattering). The dominant source of scattering for most FRBs is expected to be within their host galaxies, an assumption which can be tested by examining potential correlations between properties of the FRBs and global properties of their hosts. Using results from the CRAFT survey, we investigate correlations across a range of host galaxy properties against attributes of the FRB that encode propagation effects: scattering timescale tau, polarisation fractions, and absolute Faraday rotation measure. From 21 host galaxy properties considered, we find three correlated with tau, including the stellar surface density (or compactness; Pearson p-value p = 0.002 and Spearman p = 0.010), mass-weighted age (Spearman p-value p = 0.009), and a weaker correlation with gas-phase metallicity (Spearman p = 0.017). Weakly significant correlations are also found with Halpha equivalent widths and gravitational potential. From 10,000 trials of reshuffled datasets, we expect 2 strong Spearman correlations only 2% of the time, and three weaker correlations in 6.6% of cases. Compact host galaxies may have more ionised content which scatters the FRB further. No correlation is seen with host galaxy inclination, which weakens the case for an inclination bias, as previously suggested for samples of localised FRBs. A strong (p = 0.002) correlation is found for absolute rotation measure with optical disc axis ratio b/a; greater rotation measures are seen for edge-on host galaxies. Further high-time resolution FRB detections, coupled with localisation and detailed follow-up on their host galaxies, are necessary to corroborate these initial findings and shed further light into the FRB mechanism.",

AGN flares are extreme outbursts that deviate from this typical behavior and may trace a range of energetic physical processes. Using six years of data from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Data Release 23, we conduct a systematic search for AGN flares among a sample of well-sampled AGNs and AGN candidates. We construct two catalogs: the AGN Flare Coarse Catalog (AGNFCC), containing 28,504 flares identified via Bayesian blocks and Gaussian Processes, and the AGN Flare Refined Catalog (AGNFRC), comprising 1,984 high-confidence flares selected using stricter criteria. We analyze their spatial distribution, temporal characteristics, host AGN type and potential origins. Some flares can be associated with known supernovae, tidal disruption events, or blazars, and a few may be linked to binary black hole mergers or microlensing events. These catalogs provide a valuable resource for studying transient phenomena in AGNs and are publicly available at this https URL.",

We collected a rich set of optical and infrared follow-up observations of its rapidly fading afterglow using a suite of telescopes including the W. M. Keck Observatory, the Gemini telescopes, the Magellan Baade Telescope, the Victor M. Blanco 4-meter telescope, and the Fraunhofer Telescope at Wendelstein Observatory. Our analysis reveals that the afterglow emission is well described by forward shock emission from a highly obscured relativistic jet. Deep photometric observations of the host galaxy reveal a massive (10^10.66 solar masses), dusty, and extremely asymmetric system that is consistent with two galaxies undergoing a major merger. The galactocentric offset, host galaxy properties, and jet characteristics disfavor a jetted TDE around a supermassive black hole but do not definitively distinguish between competing progenitor scenarios. We find that the afterglow and host are consistent with a range of progenitors including an atypical collapsar, a merger between a helium star and a stellar mass black hole, the disruption of a star by a stellar mass compact object (micro-TDE), and the tidal disruption of a star by an off-nuclear intermediate mass black hole.",

For PSR J1649+2533, our results suggest mode changing rather than subpulse drifting as previously reported at lower frequencies. For PSR J1752+2359, we confirm its quasi-periodic switching between distinct emission states, but further show that the so-called \"quasi-null\" or \"RRAT-like\" state actually consists of persistent low-level emission superposed with occasional bright pulses. For PSR J1819+1305, our data confirm the modulation reported earlier, while additional weaker features are also seen. For PSR J1916+1023, we detect both nulling and subpulse drifting, but find no clear evidence of direct interaction between them. These results provide new insights into the diverse manifestations of pulsar nulling, highlight the capability of FAST to detect subtle emission states, and add to the growing body of work on pulsar emission variability.",

In this paper, we search for neutrinos from this failed supernova using data from Super-Kamiokande (SK). Based on the estimated time of black hole formation inferred from optical and infrared observations, we define a search window for neutrino events in the SK data. Using this window, we develop a dedicated analysis method for failed supernovae and apply it to M31-2014-DS1, by conducting a cluster search using the timing and energy information of candidate events. No significant neutrino excess is observed within the search region. Consequently, we place an upper limit on the electron antineutrino luminosity from M31-2014-DS1 and discuss its implications for various failed SN models and their neutrino emission characteristics. Despite the 18 MeV threshold adopted to suppress backgrounds, the search remains sufficiently sensitive to constrain the Shen-TM1 EOS, yielding a 90% confidence level upper limit of 1.76 \\times 10^{53} erg on the electron antineutrino luminosity, slightly above the expected value of 1.35 \\times 10^{53} erg.",

Remnants of partial TDEs are expected to be plentiful in our Galactic center, where at least six unexplained, diffuse, star-like \"G objects\" have already been detected which may have formed via interactions between stars and the SMBH. Using numerical simulations, this work aims to identify the characteristics of TDE remnants. We take 3D hydrodynamic FLASH models of partially disrupted stars and map them into the 1D stellar evolution code MESA to examine the properties of these remnants from tens to billions of years after the TDE. The remnants initially exhibit a brief, highly luminous phase, followed by an extended cooling period as they return to stable hydrogen burning. During the initial stage (< 100,000 yr) their luminosities increase by orders of magnitude, making them intriguing candidates to explain a fraction of the mysterious G objects. Notably, mild TDEs are the most common and result in the brightest remnants during this initial phase. However, most remnants exist in a long-lived stage where they are only modestly offset in temperature and luminosity compared to main-sequence stars of equivalent mass. Nonetheless, our results indicate remnants will sustain abnormal, metal-enriched envelopes that may be discernible through spectroscopic analysis. Identifying TDE survivors within the Milky Way could further illuminate some of the most gravitationally intense encounters in the Universe.",

Prague) in press in Universe, 28 pages, 5 figures, 1 table Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Dynamical friction implies a consistency check on any system where dark matter particles are hypothesised to explain orbital dynamics requiring more mass under Newtonian gravity than is directly detectable. Introducing the assumption of a dominant dark matter halo will also imply a decay timescale for the orbits in question. A self-consistency constraint hence arises, such that the resulting orbital decay timescales must be longer than the lifetimes of the systems in question. While such constraints are often trivially passed, the combined dependencies of dynamical friction timescales on the mass and orbital radius of the orbital tracer and on the density and velocity dispersion of the assumed dark matter particles leads to the existence of a number of astronomical systems where such a consistency test is failed. Here, we review cases from stars in ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, galactic bars, satellite galaxies, and, particularly, the multi-period mutual orbits of the Magellanic Clouds, as recently inferred from the star formation histories of these two galaxies, as well as the nearby M81 group of galaxies, where introducing enough dark matter to explain observed kinematics leads to dynamical friction orbital decay timescales shorter than the lifetimes of the systems in question. Taken together, these observations exclude dark matter halos made of particles as plausible explanations for the observed kinematics of these systems.",

Hopkins 22 pages, 9 figures, submitted to ApJ, comments are most welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) It is widely believed that the ultraviolet background produced during the epoch of reionization conspires against the formation of low-mass galaxies. Indeed, this mechanism is often invoked as a solution to the so-called `missing satellites problem.' In this paper we employ FIREbox, a large-volume cosmological simulation based on the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) physics model, to characterize the mechanisms governing galaxy ignition in the post-reionization era. By carefully matching recently-ignited halos (with stellar ages below $100$ Myr) to halos that failed to form any stars, we conclude that the presence of cold-dense gas and halo concentration help incite the process of galaxy formation. Concretely, we find that $100\\%$ of recently-ignited halos experience cold-dense gas enhancements relative to their matched failed counterparts. Likewise, approximately $83\\%$ display enhancements in both cold-dense gas and Navarro-Frenk-White concentration ($c_{\\rm NFW}$), while the remaining $\\sim17\\%$ exhibit enhanced cold-dense gas content and suppressed $c_{\\rm NFW}$ values. Lastly, our simulation suggests that galaxy ignition can occur as late as $z=2$, potentially allowing us to observationally catch this process `in the act' in the forseeable future.",

This work presents a theoretical investigation of the very-high redshift Universe using the state-of-the-art GALaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) model, run on merger trees from the Planck-Millennium $N$-body simulation. We show that GAEA successfully reproduces a wide range of high-$z$ observational estimates including: the galaxy stellar mass function up to $z\\sim13$ and the total (galaxies and AGN) UV luminosity function (LF) up to $z\\sim10$. We find that the AGN UV emission represents an important contribution at the bright end of the UVLF up to $z\\sim8$, but it is negligible at higher redshift. Our model reproduces well the observed mass-metallicity relation at $z\\leq4$, while it slightly overestimates the normalization of the relation at earlier cosmic epochs. At $z\\geq11$, current UVLF estimates are at least one order of magnitude larger than model predictions. We investigate the impact of different physical mechanisms, such as an enhanced star formation efficiency coupled with a reduced stellar feedback or a negligible stellar feedback at $z>10$. In the framework of our model, both the galaxy stellar mass and UV luminosity functions at $z\\geq10$ can be explained by assuming feedback-free starbursts in high-density molecular clouds. However, we show that this model variant leads to a slight increase of the normalization of the $z\\geq10$ mass-metallicity relation, strengthening the tension with available data. A model with negligible stellar feedback at $z>10$ also predicts larger numbers of massive and bright galaxies aligning well with observations, but it also overestimates the metallicity of the interstellar medium. We show that these model variants can in principle be discriminated using the relation between the star formation rate and galaxy stellar mass.",

Comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Gas accretion, hot ($\\sim 10^6\\,{\\rm K}$) atmospheres, and a tilt between the rotation axes of the disc and the atmosphere are all robust predictions of standard cosmology for massive star-forming galaxies at low redshift. Using idealized hydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate that the central regions of hot galaxy atmospheres continuously condense into cool ($\\sim10^4\\,{\\rm K}$) discs, while being replenished by an inflow from larger scales. The size and orientation of the condensed disc are determined by the angular momentum of the atmosphere, so it is large and often tilted with respect to the pre-existing galaxy disc. Continuous smooth accretion from hot atmospheres can thus both provide the necessary fuel for star formation and explain the observed ubiquity of extended and warped HI discs around local spirals. In this hot accretion scenario, cool gas observations cannot be used to trace the source of the HI, warps out to halo radii, consistent with recent indications of a lack of $21\\,{\\rm cm}$ emission from the halos of nearby galaxies (the `HI desert'). Observations of HI warps formed via hot accretion can be used to constrain the angular momentum, accretion rate, and gas metallicity of hot galaxy atmospheres, important parameters for disc galaxy evolution that are hard to determine by other means.",

To be submitted to the Open Journal of Astrophysics - comments welcome. Code to reproduce all results/figures provided at this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) are an essential tool for galaxy evolution science with JWST. However, for deep surveys with more limited filter sets (i.e. $N_{\\text{filt}} \\sim6$) such as large pure parallel surveys, the most commonly used template-fitting based photo-$z$ approaches can yield highly confident but spurious results for high-$z$ populations of interest. The utility and legacy value of these datasets could therefore be negatively impacted. To address this challenge, we present an application of machine learning (ML) based photo-$z$ techniques to deep JWST photometric datasets. We employ two different ML algorithms, using Gaussian processes and nearest-neighbour estimates, alongside a more standard template fitting approach. We show that simple nearest-neighbour based estimates can provide more accurate photo-$z$s than template fitting out to $z\\sim8$, as well as reducing the fraction of catastrophic outliers by a factor of $\\sim2-3$. Additionally, `hybrid' estimates combining template and ML can yield further improvements in overall accuracy and reliability while retaining some ability to predict photo-$z$ out to $z > 10$. The nearest-neighbour only or hybrid estimates can achieve photo-$z$s with robust scatter of $\\sigma_{\\text{NMAD}}\\sim0.03-0.04$ and outlier fractions of $\\sim3-10\\%$ between $0 < z \\lesssim 8$ from just 6 NIRCam bands, with negligible additional computational costs compared to standard template fitting. Our methodology is easily adaptable to alternative datasets, filter combinations or training samples. Overall, our results highlight the potential for even simple ML techniques to enhance the scientific return of JWST pure parallel and wide-area surveys.",

Mundy 43 pages, 24 figures. Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We characterize the physical conditions and energy budget of the M16 H II region using SOFIA FEEDBACK observations of the [C II] 158 $\\mu$m line. The O stars in the $\\sim 10^{4}~{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ NGC 6611 cluster powering this H II region have blown at least 2 cavities into the giant molecular cloud: the large M16 cavity and the small N19 bubble. We detect the spectroscopic signature of an expanding photodissociation region shell towards N19, and traces of a thin, fragmented expanding shell towards M16. Our [C II] observations are resolved to 0.5 km s$^{-1}$ and 15.5$^{\\prime\\prime}$ and analyzed alongside similarly resolved CO J=3$-$2 observations as well as archival data ranging from the radio to X-ray tracing a variety of gas phases spanning dense $\\sim$10 K molecular gas, $10^{4}$ K photoionized gas, and million-K collisionally ionized plasma. With this dataset, we evaluate the coupling of energetic feedback from NGC 6611 and the O9 V star within N19 to the surrounding gas. Winds from NGC 6611 have blown a 20 pc radius cavity constrained in size along the major axis of the natal giant molecular filament, and much of the mechanical wind energy ($>$90%) has escaped through breaches in the $\\lesssim 10^{4}~{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ shell. Reservoirs of dense gas remain within a few parsecs of the cluster. N19, younger than M16 by $\\gtrsim 10^6$ yr, is driven by a combination of mechanical wind energy and thermal pressure from photoionized gas and has swept up $\\sim 10^{3}~{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ into neutral atomic and molecular shells.",

Forbes, Guacimara García-Bethencourt, Jean P Brodie, Noam Libeskind, Warrick J. Couch, Johanna Hartke 10 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) In this work, we compare galaxies from the NIHAO and HESTIA simulation suites to ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) with spectroscopically measured dynamical masses. For each observed UDG, we identify the simulated dark matter halo that best matches its dynamical mass. In general, observed UDGs are matched to simulated galaxies with lower stellar masses than they are observed to have. These simulated galaxies also have halo masses much less than would be expected given the observed UDG's stellar mass and the stellar mass -- halo mass relationship. We use the recently established relation between globular cluster (GC) number and halo mass, which has been shown to be applicable to UDGs, to better constrain their observed halo masses. This method indicates that observed UDGs reside in relatively massive dark matter halos. This creates a striking discrepancy: the simulated UDGs are matched to the dynamical masses of observed ones, but not their total halo masses. In other words, simulations can produce UDGs in halos with the correct inner dynamics, but not with the massive halos implied by GC counts. We explore several possible explanations for this tension, from both the observational and theoretical sides. We propose that the most likely resolution is that observed UDGs may have fundamentally different dark matter halo profiles than those produced in NIHAO and HESTIA. This highlights the need for a simulation that self-consistently produces galaxies of a stellar mass of $\\sim 10^8 M_\\odot$ in dark matter halos that exhibit the full range of large dark matter cores to cuspy NFW-like halos.",

      "abstract": "Machine-Learning Estimation of Energy Fractions in MHD Turbulence Modes Jiyao Zhang, Yue Hu 10 pages, 6 figures, submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence plays a central role in many astrophysical processes in the interstellar medium (ISM), including star formation, heat conduction, and cosmic-ray scattering. MHD turbulence can be decomposed into three fundamental modes-fast, slow, and Alfvén-each contributing differently to the dynamics of the medium. However, characterizing and separating the energy fractions of these modes was challenging due to the limited information available from observations. To address this difficulty, we use 3D isothermal and multiphase MHD turbulence simulations to examine how mode energy fractions vary under different physical conditions. Overall, we find that the Alfvén and slow modes carry comparable kinetic-energy fractions and together dominate the turbulent energy budget in multiphase media, while the fast mode contributes the smallest fraction. Relative to isothermal conditions, multiphase simulations exhibit an enhanced fast-mode energy fraction. We further introduce a machine-learning-based approach that employs a conditional Residual Neural Network to infer these fractions directly from spectroscopic data. The method leverages the fact that the three MHD modes imprint distinct morphological signatures in spectroscopic maps owing to their differing anisotropies and compressibilities. Our model is trained on a suite of isothermal and multiphase simulations covering typical ISM conditions. We further demonstrate that our machine learning model can robustly recover the mode fractions from spectroscopic observables, achieving mean absolute errors of approximately 0.05 for seen data and 0.1 for unseen data.",

Submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Classical Cepheids are among the most important distance calibrators and play a crucial role in the calibration as the first rung of the extragalactic distance ladder. Given their typical age, they also constitute an optimal tracer of the young population in the Galactic disc. We aim to increase the number of available DCEPS with high-resolution spectroscopic metallicities, to study the galactocentric radial gradients of several chemical elements and analyse the spatial distribution of the Galactic young population of stars in the Milky Way disc. We performed a complete spectroscopical analysis of 136 spectra obtained from three different high-resolution spectrographs, for a total of 60 DCEPs. More than half have pulsational periods longer than 15 days, up to 70 days, doubling the number of stars in our sample with P>15d. We derived radial velocities, atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances up to 33 different species. We present an updated list of trusted spectroscopic lines for the detection and estimation of chemical abundances. We used this new set to revisit the abundances already published in the context of the C-MetaLL survey and increase the number of available chemical species. For the first time (to our knowledge), we present the estimation of abundances for Dysprosium, as well as a systematic estimation of Erbium, Lutetium and Thorium abundances. We calculate a galactic radial gradient for [Fe/H] with a slope of $-0.064\\pm0.002$, in good agreement with recent literature estimation. The other elements also exhibit a clear negative radial trend, with this effect diminishing and eventually disappearing for heavier neutron-capture elements. Depending on the proposed spiral arms model present in several literature sources, our most external stars agree on tracing either the Perseus, the Norma-Outer or both the Outer and the association Outer-Scutum-Centaurus (OSC) arms.",

Nidever 43 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) In addition to comprehensive surveys of the Milky Way bulge, disk, and halo, the Apache Point Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) project observed seven dwarf spheroidal satellites (dSphs) of the Milky Way: Carina, Sextans, Sculptor, Draco, Ursa Minor, Bootes 1, and Fornax. APOGEE radial velocities, stellar parameters, and Gaia EDR3 proper motions are used to identify member stars in the vicinity of each dwarf. To properly analyze the abundance patterns of these galaxies, a novel procedure was developed to determine the measurable upper limits of the APOGEE chemical abundances as a function of the effective temperature and the spectral signal-to-noise ratio. In general, the APOGEE abundance patterns of these galaxies (limited to [Fe/H] $>$ -2.5) agree with those found in high-resolution optical studies after abundance offsets are applied. Most of the galaxies studied have abundance patterns that are distinctly different from the majority of stars found in the MW halo, suggesting that these galaxies contributed little to the MW halo above [Fe/H] $>$ -2.0. From these abundance patterns, we find that these dSphs tend to follow two types of chemical evolution paths: episodic and continuous star formation, a result that is consistent with previous photometric studies of their star formation histories. We explore whether mass and/or environment have an impact on whether a galaxy has an episodic or continuous star formation history, finding evidence that, in addition to the galaxy's mass, proximity to a larger galaxy and the cessation of star formation may drive the overall shape of the chemical evolution.",

The high-velocity jet is enveloped by a lower-velocity outflow cavity, containing bright knots that show enhanced molecular intensities and elevated excitation temperatures. Along the outflow, we have identified 35 transitions from 22 molecular species. By analyzing the spatial distribution and kinematics of these molecular lines, we find that the molecular inventory in the outflow is regulated by three processes: (i) direct entrainment from the natal molecular core by the outflow; (ii) shock-induced release of molecules or atoms from dust grains; and (iii) thermal desorption and gas-phase reactions driven by shock heating. These results confirm that outflows are not only dynamical structures but also active chemical factories, where entrainment, shocks, and thermal processing jointly enrich the molecular content. Our findings confirmed that outflow chemistry has multi-origin nature, and provide critical insights into chemical evolution during high-mass star formation.",

Accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We use the deep NIRCam and MIRI imaging from the JWST PRIMER survey to study the properties of (sub)mm sources detected by ALMA in the centre of the COSMOS field, with the aim of better constraining the history of dust-enshrouded star formation. The wealth of ALMA data in this field enabled us to isolate a robust sample of 128 (sub)mm sources within the 175 sq. arcmin of the PRIMER COSMOS survey footprint, spanning two decades in (sub)mm flux density. The JWST imaging is deep/red enough to reveal secure galaxy counterparts for all of these sources. Moreover, 52% of the galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts, enabling us to refine the photo-zs for the remaining galaxies. Armed with this robust redshift information, we calculate the star-formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses of all 128 ALMA-detected galaxies, and place them in the context of other galaxies in the field. We find that the vast majority of star formation is dust-enshrouded in the ALMA-detected galaxies, with SFR ranging from ~1000 down to ~20 solar masses per year. We also find that virtually all (126/128) have high stellar masses, at all redshifts, with log(M/Msun) > 10. The unusually high quality of our sample enables us to make a robust estimate of the contribution of the ALMA-detected galaxies to cosmic star-formation rate density from z = 2 out to z = 7. Finally, to correct for the fact that the deep ALMA pointings cover < 20% of the PRIMER COSMOS area, we use our knowledge of all other massive galaxies in the field to produce a completeness-corrected estimate of dust-enshrouded star-formation rate density over cosmic time. This confirms that UV-visible star formation dominates at z > 4, but also indicates that dust-enshrouded star formation likely still made a significant contribution at higher redshifts: extrapolation of our results suggest a ~20% contribution at z = 8, and potentially still ~5% at z = 10.",

The [CII]158$\\mu$m and Ly$\\alpha$ lines are found in the middle of two clumps (the brightest clump) in Himiko (CR7), suggesting that the distribution of neutral gas does not always coincide with that of ionized gas or stars in merging processes. We find that some of the clumps have broad [OIII] components (250--400$~\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$) in Himiko and CR7, likely tracing outflow and tidal features, while the central clump in Himiko presents a broad H$\\alpha$ ($\\sim1000~\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$) line explained by an AGN with a low mass black hole of $M_\\mathrm{BH}=10^{6.6}~M_\\odot$, which contribute to the extended and bright nature of Himiko and CR7.

Gladders 27 pages, 16 figures. Submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) At present, the best opportunity for detailed Lyman Continuum escape studies is in gravitationally lensed galaxies at z >~ 2. Only one such galaxy currently exists in the literature with sufficient spatial magnification: The Sunburst Arc at redshift z = 2.37. Here, we present rest-frame optical JWST NIRSpec integral field observations of the Sunburst Arc that cover a large fraction of the source plane. From this dataset, we generate precise maps of ISM kinematics, dust geometry, ionization, and chemical enrichment. We extract a stacked spectrum of five gravitationally lensed images of the Lyman-Continuum leaking cluster, as well as an magnification-corrected, integrated spectrum of most of the galaxy, enabling a direct comparison to other LyC leakers in the literature. We find that the galaxy rotates but also shows strong, possibly dominant, signatures of turbulence, which are indicative of recent or ongoing major interaction. The cluster that leaks ionizing photons shows little variation in kinematics or dust coverage, but dramatically elevated ionization, indicating that photoionization is the predominant mechanism that creates paths for LyC escape. We conjecture that tidal stripping of H I gas due to an interaction could have removed a large portion of the neutral ISM around the LyC emitting cluster, making it easier for the cluster to completely ionize the rest.",

While the widely accepted swing-amplification theory provides a qualitative framework for their formation, the detailed physical processes remain incompletely understood. Previous studies have shown that the bar formation timescale in isolated galaxies depends exponentially on the disk mass fraction (the so-called \"Fujii relation\") and linearly on disk hotness and thickness. However, the influence of dark matter halo spin on bar formation has not been systematically investigated. In this work, we construct a suite of $N$-body models of disk and halo with varying disk mass fractions and amounts of random motions. By introducing prograde and retrograde spins in the dark matter halo, we explore how halo spin modifies the established empirical relations governing bar formation timescales. We find that these relations remain valid in both prograde and retrograde halo spin models. For rapid bar formation (short timescale), the effect of halo spin is nearly negligible. In contrast, for moderately slow bar formation, prograde (retrograde) halo spin tends to accelerate (suppress) bar onset. In cases of extremely slow bar formation, halo spin introduces a stronger but more stochastic influence. These trends might arise from the exchange of angular momentum between the stellar disk and the dark matter halo.",

Fixed aperture photometry of the comet is well described by a power law function of heliocentric distance, rH, with the exponent (``index\") n = 3.8+/-0.3 across the 4.6 au to 1.8 au distance range (phase function 0.04+/-0.02 magnitude/degree assumed). This indicates that the dust production rates vary in proportion to rH**(-1.8+/-0.3). An rH**(-2) variation is expected of a strongly volatile material, and consistent with independent spectroscopic observations showing that carbon dioxide is the primary driver of activity. The measured heliocentric index is unremarkable in the context of solar system comets, for which n is widely dispersed, and provides no basis on which to describe 3I as either dynamically old (thermally processed) or new (pristine). The morphology of the comet changes from a Sun-facing dust fan in the early 2025 July observations, to one dominated by an antisolar dust tail at later dates. We attribute the delayed emergence of the tail to the large size (effective radius 0.1 mm) and slow ejection (5 m/s) of the optically dominant dust particles, and their consequently sluggish response to solar radiation pressure. Small (micron-sized) particles may be present but not in numbers sufficient to dominate the scattering cross-section. Their relative depletion possibly reflects interparticle cohesion, which binds small particles more effectively than large ones. A similar preponderance of 0.1 mm grains was reported in 2I/Borisov. However, 2I differed from 3I in having a much smaller (asteroid-like) heliocentric index, n = 1.9+/-0.1. Dust production rates in 3I are 180 kg/s at 2 au, compared with 70 kg/s in 2I/Borisov at the same distance.",

Observed SEDs are compared with theoretical models to characterize the central stars and their circumstellar dust envelopes and to estimate distances. For the LMC, a set of best-fitting CAGB models is derived by fitting observed SEDs with radiative transfer models, utilizing the galaxy's well-established distance. For Galactic CAGB stars, where Gaia DR3 parallaxes are uncertain, we estimate distances by fitting observed SEDs with the CAGB models validated against LMC stars, and for Mira variables, from the period-magnitude relation calibrated with LMC Miras. A comparison of these approaches demonstrates that the SED-based distances are both reliable and practical for a large sample of Galactic CAGB stars. We find that CAGB stars in both galaxies show broadly similar infrared properties, although the LMC sample lacks stars with extremely thick dust envelopes.",

Duarte Published in Journal of High Energy Astrophysics (2026) 50:100505 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) White Dwarfs (WDs), the final evolutionary stage of most stars, are frequently modeled considering only a dense plasma matter. However, their potential interaction with dark matter (DM), especially in galactic halos where DM is expected to be prevalent, may lead to significant consequences. This work proposes a novel EoS (EoS) that consistently incorporates both hot dense plasma and cold dark matter (CDM) contributions in hot WDs. The hot dense plasma EoS is extended to include thermal and radiative contributions. At the same time, the CDM component is modeled as a linear fluid, with the coupling constant $\\alpha$ determined self-consistently within the star. A smooth phase transition between hot dense plasma and CDM regimes is introduced via a hyperbolic mixing function that depends on local energy density and stellar temperature. Our results show that the inclusion of CDM leads to an increase in the WD radius by approximately $12\\%$ and a total mass enhancement of $0.7\\%$, compared to standard hot WD models without lattice effects. These results highlight the importance of considering CDM in stellar modeling and suggest that WDs may serve as indirect probes for the astrophysical properties of dark matter.",

Blume, Bradley Hindman Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Though Rossby waves have been observed on the Sun, their radial eigenfunctions remain a mystery. The prior theoretical work either considers quasi-2D systems, which do not apply to the solar interior, or only considers fully radiative or fully convective atmospheres. This project calculates the radial eigenfunctions for Rossby waves in a deep atmosphere for a general stratification. Here, we use the $\\beta$-plane approximation to derive a vertical equation in terms of the Lagrangian pressure fluctuation $\\delta P$, and we then calculate radial eigenfunctions for Rossby waves in a standard solar model, Model S. We find that working in the Lagrangian pressure fluctuation results in cleaner wave equations that lack internal singularities that have been encountered in prior work. The resulting radial wave equation makes it abundantly clear that there are two wave cavities in the solar interior, one in the radiative interior and another in the convection zone. Surprisingly, our calculated radial vorticity eigenfunctions for the radiative interior modes are nearly constant throughout the convection zone, raising the possibility that they may be observable at the solar surface.",

Accepted to Astronomy Reports, 2025 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Solar activity is a process driven by many independent but interconnected phenomena. Although the 11-year cycle is the result of operation of the dynamo mechanism, the cause of longer secular variations is not clear. In search of such a cause, it was proposed to take into account the influence of the planetary system. In order to verify the idea, we consider the action of all planets in the solar system reduced to the effect of a single barycenter. The tidal force is decomposed into radial and meridional components. The radial tidal force is too small compared to the powerful radial gravity of the Sun. The meridional force is not compensated for by solar gravity and depends on latitude. As the latitude of the barycenter changes quite slowly, the sign of this component changes over a characteristic time scale of about 5 years, during which the meridional acceleration constantly acts on the surface of the Sun. This could ultimately lead to speeds of several meters per second and, in principle, could significantly change the speeds of the meridional currents involved in generating the magnetic field. However, it turned out that the calculated speed variation does not agree with the observed periodicity of solar activity. Earlier, the relation was analyzed between the activity periods on solar-type stars and the rotation periods of exoplanets, and no correspondence was observed either. Thus, the planetary hypothesis as a cause of long-term modulation of solar activity is not confirmed.",

Shen 27 pages, 11 figures (2 animations) Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) During mid-May 2024, active region (AR) 13664 produced a series of M- and X-class flares along with several coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that resulted in exceptionally strong aurora at Earth. This study presents in-situ solar energetic particle (SEP) ion composition data from Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory Ahead (STA), Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), and Parker Solar Probe (PSP) as their magnetic connectivity to AR 13664 varied throughout the event period. Between 08 to 24 May, STA was separated by 12° in longitude from ACE at 0.96 AU. SEP intensities rose gradually due to merged CMEs from AR 13664. On 13 May, an M6 flare was followed by a rapid-onset SEP event at STA, although velocity dispersion analysis yielded no clear path length or release time. PSP, 95° longitudinally separated from Earth at 0.74 AU, observed gradually increasing SEP intensities beginning 11 May, followed by a jump in both SEP intensity and magnetic field (>100 nT) on 16 May. These early event intervals display stepwise SEP increases, consistent with the passage of successive CMEs. On 20 May, an X16.5 flare from AR 13664 produced an Fe-rich SEP event observed at all three spacecraft despite their wide longitudinal separations. Throughout the period, Fe/O ratios ranged from <0.01 to >0.8 and increased with energy between 1 to 100 MeV/nuc. This trend deviates from the typical energy-dependent decrease expected from diffusive shock acceleration and suggests more complex scenarios, possibly involving variable suprathermal seed populations or species-dependent transport.",

Based on these calculations, we derive profiles for various transport coefficients. Our results demonstrate that thermal conductivity in partially ionized media, both parallel and perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field, is dominated by neutral particles. The perpendicular thermal conductivity components show weak dependence on the ion Hall parameter and remain comparable in magnitude to their parallel counterparts. Wave damping through neutral thermal conductivity may contribute significantly to solar atmospheric heating.

Kato 18 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables, accepted for a publication in MNRAS Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Dwarf nova (DN) superoutbursts are accompanied by superhumps, which change their periods and profiles over a superoutburst. We present the TESS and ground-based observations of nine WZ Sge-type DNe and candidates in superoutburst. In TCP J23580961$+$5502508, ASASSN-23ba, PNV J19030433$-$3102187, V748 Hya, and ASASSN-25ci, we confirmed double-peaked oscillations called early superhumps, which are regarded as the unambiguous feature of WZ Sge-type DNe. On the other hand, the superhump and outburst properties of MO Psc and V1676 Her suggest that they may not be a member of WZ Sge-type DNe. The 2022 superoutburst of a confirmed WZ Sge-type DN TCP J05515391$+$6504346, however, lacked an early superhump phase. We find superhumps in a WZ Sge-type DN ASASSN-20mq during its rebrightening outburst. Thanks to the continuous coverage of TESS, we find the broken-powerlaw rise of the outburst light curve in V748 Hya and PNV J19030433$-$3102187, previously found in only one WZ Sge-type DN observed by Kepler. Early superhumps appeared when the system reached $\\simeq40$% of the outburst peak flux. No orbital modulation from a hot spot is detected before and after this. This non-detection of orbital humps on the early rise of V748 Hya constrains that the corresponding mass transfer rate should be below $\\simeq1\\times10^{16}$ g s$^{-1}$, disfavouring an enhancement of a mass transfer rate by an order of magnitude or larger, even if it occurs. The contentious TESS observations also confirm the coexistence of early and ordinary superhumps during their transition and $\\leq$2-cycle duration of stage A--B superhump transition in V748 Hya.",

Lloveras Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Solar filaments are cool and dense plasma structures suspended in the solar corona against gravity. We present observations of a quiescent filament eruption that occurs on 13 July 2015. The eruption is associated with a two-ribbon GOES B8.9 class flare. Photospheric magnetic flux cancellation is present below the filament during days. This builds up a flux rope which progressively rises until it gets unstable, first leading to a confined eruption and pre-flare brightenings, then to an ejection which starts $\\approx$ 20 min later with the flare onset. An interesting feature of this event is the presence of a large circular brightening formed around the erupting region. This brightening is produced due to interchange reconnection of the ejected magnetic configuration with the surrounding open magnetic field. This null-point topology is confirmed by a potential-field extrapolation. The EUV loops located on the southern side of the filament eruption first contract during the null-point reconnection, then expand as the flux rope is ejected. The associated CME has both a classical flux rope shape and plasma ejected along open field lines on the flux rope side (a trace of interchange reconnection). Finally, we set all this disparate observations within a coherent framework where magnetic reconnection occurs both below and above the erupting filament.",

Observed data coupled with radiation transfer models in physical conditions representative of stars, planets, kilonovae, and ISM, yield constrains on their physical structure, gas flow dynamics at the surface, mass loss, and detailed chemical composition of the systems. All these core astrophysical parameters are just as reliable as the physical quality of the models that are employed for simulations of radiation transfer. Recent advances in multi-D transfer modeling with Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) in inhomogeneous time-dependent systems revealed systematic shortcomings of canonical models. Owing to major complexities of solving coupled multi-frequency RT equations in 3D geometry, a number of approximations have been introduced. This review presents an overview of the physical problem, standard solutions, and recent methodological advances. We also provide an overview of main results in the area of 3D NLTE radiation transfer and its applications to modeling diverse astrophysical environments, including FGKM type- and OBA-type stars, multi-epoch spectra of kilonovae, and atmospheres of rocky and gaseous exoplanets.",

Johnson, Jiadong Li, Bo Zhang Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We investigated a volume-limited sample of LAMOST main-sequence stars with masses from 0.25 to 1 $M_{\\odot}$ and distances of 150-350 pc to explore how the stellar initial mass function (IMF) varies with metallicity. We corrected the spectroscopic selection function by comparing the stellar number densities with the photometric ones at the same colour and magnitude. From these corrected number density distributions, we derived IMFs for each metallicity sub-samples. Fitting a broken power-law function in each IMF with a fixed break point at 0.525 $M_{\\odot}$, we found the power-law indices increase with [Fe/H] for both mass regimes: $\\alpha_1$ (mass $\\leq$ 0.525 $M_{\\odot}$) rises from 0.54 $\\pm$ 0.21 to 1.40 $\\pm$ 0.07 and $\\alpha_2$ (mass>0.525 $M_{\\odot}$) grows from 1.40 $\\pm$ 0.16 to 1.86 $\\pm$ 0.04 as [Fe/H] varies from -1 to +0.5 dex. It demonstrates that low-mass stars make up a larger fraction in metal-rich environments than in metal-poor ones. We performed simulations to assess the impact of unresolved binaries on the IMF power-law indices. After correction, the binary-adjusted $\\alpha$ values retained a similar metallicity-dependent trend. Furthermore, by examining the IMF of the aggregate sample, we found the corrected indices ($\\alpha_{\\rm{1,corr}} = 1.48 \\pm 0.03$ , $\\alpha_{\\rm{2,corr}} = 2.17 \\pm 0.03$) are consistent with Kroupa's IMF values ($\\alpha_1 = 1.3 \\pm 0.5$ and $\\alpha_2 = 2.3 \\pm 0.3$). Finally, we verified the robustness of our results by testing different break points and mass bin sizes, confirming that the IMF's dependence on [Fe/H] remains consistent.",

Sundqvist, Andreas A.C. Sander Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The atmospheres of massive O-type stars (O stars) are dynamic, turbulent environments resulting from radiatively driven instabilities over the iron bump, located slightly beneath the stellar surface. Here, complex radiation hydrodynamic processes affect the structure of the atmosphere as well as the formation of spectral lines. In quantitative spectroscopic analysis, the effects of these processes are often parametrized with ad hoc techniques and values. This work is aimed at exploring how variation of basic atmospheric parameters affects the dynamics within the subsurface turbulent zone. We also explore how this turbulence relates to absorption lines formed in the photosphere for a broad range of O stars at solar metallically. The work in this paper centers around a grid of 2D, radiation-hydrodynamic O-star atmosphere and wind simulations, where the turbulent region is an emergent property of the simulation. For each of the 36 models in the grid, we derived the turbulent properties and correlated them to an estimate of turbulent line broadening imposed by the models' velocity fields. Our work suggests that the subphotospheric turbulent velocity in O-stars scales approximately with the square of the Eddington arameter, $\\Gamma_{\\rm e}$. We also find a linear correlation between subphotospheric turbulent velocity and the line broadening of several synthetic photospheric absorption lines. Radiation carries more energy than advection throughout the atmosphere for all models in the grid; however, for O-type supergiants, the latter can account for up to 30 \\% of the total flux at the peak of the iron bump.",

To assess CME geoeffectiveness, among other scientific goals, it is necessary to reliably identify and characterize their morphology and kinematics in coronagraph images. Current methods of CME identification are either subjected to human biases or perform a poor identification due to deficiencies in the automatic detection. In this approach, we have trained the deep convolutional neural model Mask R-CNN to automatically segment the outer envelope of one or multiple CMEs present in a single difference coronagraph image. The empirical training dataset is composed of 10^5 synthetic coronagraph images with known pixel-level CME segmentation masks. It is obtained by combining quiet coronagraph observations, with synthetic white-light CMEs produced using the GCS geometric model and ray-tracing technique. We found that our model-based trained Mask R-CNN infers segmentation masks that are smooth and topologically connected. While the inferred masks are not representative of the detailed outer envelope of complex CMEs, the neural model can better differentiate a CME from other radially moving background/foreground features, segment multiple simultaneous CMEs that are close to each other, and work with images from different instruments. This is accomplished without relying on kinematic information, i.e. only the included in the single input difference image. We obtain a median IoU=0.98 for 1.6*10^4 synthetic validation images, and IoU=0.77 when compared with two independent manual segmentations of 115 observations acquired by the COR2-A, COR2-B and LASCO C2 coronagraphs. The methodology presented in this work can be used with other CME models to produce more realistic synthetic brightness images while preserving desired morphological features, and obtain more robust and/or tailored segmentations.",

Herczeg, Bo Reipurth Accepted by ApJ Letters. 10 pages, including 5 figures Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) FU Ori outbursts are thought to play an important role in stellar assembly and the evolution of protoplanetary disks. However, the progenitor young stellar objects are largely uncharacterized. We obtained a low-resolution optical spectrum of HBC 722 before its FU Ori outburst as part of a survey of young stellar objects in the North America Nebula. The spectrum yields a spectral type of M3.3$\\pm$0.4, which when combined with archival photometry allows us to measure the stellar and accretion properties of a young star prior to its FU Ori outburst. The pre-outburst accretion rate of $7\\times10^{-9}$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ is high for a protoplanetary disk around an M3-M3.5 star, though about 15,000 times weaker than the accretion rate during the outburst. The pre-outburst variability, inferred from archival B-band photometry, is about a factor 5 with a standard deviation of 0.16 dex and is consistent with variable accretion onto young low-mass stars. The stellar radius is larger than the radius of accreting young stars of similar spectral type by a factor of two. The extinction to HBC 722 is $\\sim 1.45\\pm0.3$~mag, lower than the 2.5--3.7~mag extinction values measured during the outburst. The u-band photometry plays an especially important role in constraining the veiling at longer wavelengths and therefore also the extinction and photospheric luminosity.",

Huertas-Roldán, G. Ouerfelli Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The coexistence of PAHs and the C$_{60}$ fullerene in different astrophysical environments can give rise to the formation of new complex species denoted as PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts, which may contribute to the infrared (IR) emission observed. These PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts have been previously reported experimentally due to the high reactivity between PAHs and C$_{60}$. From the astrophysical point of view, however, they have not been considered in detail yet. Here we have performed a combined experimental and theoretical study in order to characterize the IR spectra of PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts, including multiple adducts. By using new advanced experimental techniques, we have been able to synthesize some specific PAH-C$_{60}$ adduct isomers, and measured their IR spectra. These experimental data are used to correct their harmonic scaled spectra, as obtained from quantum-chemistry calculations performed at the DFT level under the B3LYP-GD3/6-31+G(d) approach. This way, we simulate the IR ($\\sim$3$-$25 $\\mu$m) spectra of multiple PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts, composed by a different number of PAH units: mostly one or two units. In addition, the chemical kinetics data available in the literature are used to tentatively estimate the possible order of magnitude of the abundances of these PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts using the available observational data. Essentially, our results reveal a possible strong modification of the IR spectra when astronomically estimated abundances are considered. Several spectral peculiarities are observed, such as a broad $\\sim$3.4-3.6 $\\mu$m feature, and important modifications in the 6-10 and 12-16 $\\mu$m spectral regions together with contributions to the C$_{60}$ features at 7.0 and 18.9 $\\mu$m. Interestingly, these PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts lack aliphatic CH bonds, but they display IR features around 3.4 $\\mu$m, challenging previous interpretations of this astronomical feature.",

The DYNAMO-VLBA project utilizes the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) to study tight binary and multiple pre-main sequence stars, whose components have detectable radio emission and typical separations on the order of milli-arcseconds. Such systems cannot be resolved by Gaia, making VLBI an essential tool for the study of their orbital parameters and, eventually, the determination of their mass. Here, we report VLBA dynamical mass measurements of the individual stars in the S1 system in Ophiuchus and EC\\,95 in Serpens. S1 is the most luminous and massive stellar member of the nearby Ophiuchus star-forming region. We find that the primary component, S1A, has a mass of $4.11 \\pm 0.10\\,M_{\\odot}$. This is significantly less than the value of $\\sim6\\,M_{\\odot}$ expected from theoretical models given the location of S1A on the HR diagram. The secondary, S1B, has a mass of $0.831 \\pm 0.014\\,M_{\\odot}$ and is most likely a T Tauri star.

By varying the fluctuation-to-mean magnetic-field ratio $\\delta B_0/B_0$, we examine curvature $\\kappa$ statistics and their connection to particle acceleration. The curvature probability densities display broad power-law wings, scaling linearly in $\\kappa$ below the peak and developing hard high-$\\kappa$ tails for $\\delta B_0/B_0 \\gtrsim 1$. As the mean field strengthens, the high-$\\kappa$ tails steepen, and large-curvature events are suppressed when $\\delta B_0/B_0 \\ll 1$. The probability density functions of magnetic field-line contraction, ${\\bf v}_E \\cdot {\\bf \\kappa}$, with ${\\bf v}_E$ the field-line velocity, develop power-law tails well described by a symmetric Pareto distribution, characteristic of stochastic energy exchanges, with the tails becoming harder as $\\delta B_0/B_0$ increases. Our guiding-center analysis shows that curvature-drift acceleration accounts for a substantial fraction of the energization via the motional electric field, and that it strengthens with increasing $\\delta B_0/B_0$. For well-magnetized particles, curvature-drift acceleration typically exceeds ${\\bf\\nabla}B$ drift, polarization drift, and betatron contributions. These results identify curvature-drift acceleration as a principal pathway through which magnetized turbulence transfers energy to nonthermal particles in astrophysical plasmas.",

Abdulla, Hamid M. Al-Naimiy Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of observations carried out on the exoplanet HAT-P-25 b at the Sharjah Astronomical Observatory (SAO). We have employed two distinct filters, namely, the Luminoso (L) and Visual (V) filters. Our research aims to discern any variations in transit depth or exoplanet size resulting from the use of these different filters. The primary focus of this study is to determine the exoplanet's size relative to its host star using the transit method. The application of different filters was expected to introduce subtle variations in size, influenced by factors such as the exoplanet's atmosphere. Notably, our findings reveal that the exoplanet's size appears larger when observed through the L filter compared to the V filter. Throughout the analytical process, we employed the TRASCA model to determine the transit depth for each epoch. Fixed parameters, including the orbital period of the exoplanet (P, measured in days) and the transit duration (measured in minutes), were utilized in these calculations. Our results indicate that the transit depths observed with the L filter were greater than those with the V filter, measuring 0.0238 magnitudes and 0.0200 magnitudes, respectively. These values deviate from the reference result of 0.0204 magnitudes.",

The elusive physical processes responsible for the generation of the different types of this wind are a topic of active debate. Recent observations reveal intermittent jets, with kinetic energy in the picoflare range, emerging from dark areas of a polar coronal hole threaded by open magnetic field lines. These could substantially contribute to solar wind. However, their ubiquity and direct links to solar wind have not been established. Here, we report a unique set of remote-sensing and in situ observations from the Solar Orbiter spacecraft that establish a unified picture of fast and Alfvénic slow wind, connected to the similar widespread picoflare jet activity in two coronal holes. Radial expansion of coronal holes ultimately regulates the speed of the emerging wind.",

Pallé 16 pages, 15 figures (including 4 in the appendix), 6 tables (including 1 in the appendix), accepted for publication in MNRAS Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The measurements of pressure-mode and mixed-mode oscillation frequencies in subgiant stars offer a unique opportunity to probe their internal structures -- from the surface to the deep interior -- and to precisely determine their global properties. We have conducted a detailed asteroseismic analysis of the benchmark subgiant $\\mu$ Herculis using eight seasons of radial velocity observations from the SONG-Tenerife, and have determined its mass, radius, age, and surface helium abundance to be $1.105_{-0.024}^{+0.058}$ M$_\\odot$, $1.709_{-0.015}^{+0.030}$ R$_\\odot$, $8.4_{-0.1}^{+0.4}$ Gyr, and $0.242^{+0.006}_{-0.021}$, respectively. We have demonstrated that simultaneously fitting the helium glitch properties, oscillation frequencies, and spectroscopic observables yields a more accurate inference of the surface helium abundance and hence stellar age. A significant discrepancy between the observed extent of the helium ionization zone and that predicted by stellar models is identified and examined, underscoring potential limitations in the current modelling of stellar interiors. Our analysis confirms that the helium glitch originates from the region between the two stages of helium ionisation, i.e. from the $\\Gamma_1$ peak, rather than from the second helium ionisation zone itself. Within the conventional formalism, this implies that the glitch analysis characterises the region located between the two helium ionisation zones.",

Pignatari Accepted for publication in A&A Letters. 9 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Carbon-oxygen (C-O) shell mergers in massive stars play a crucial role in both nucleosynthesis and the final stages of stellar evolution. These convective-reactive events significantly alter the internal structure of the star shortly before core collapse. We investigate how the enhanced production of light particles (especially protons) during a C-O shell merger, relative to classical oxygen shell burning, affects the energy balance and evolution of the convective shell. We derive the budget for direct and reverse nucleosynthesis flows across all relevant nuclear reactions from stellar evolution models, and we assess the relative energy produced. We find that proton capture reactions on 32,34S, 31P, and 38Ar (SPAr) dominate the nuclear energy production in typical C-O shell mergers as predicted by 1D stellar models. Their combined energy output is approximately 400 times greater than that of C and O fusion under the same conditions. Our results highlight the critical importance of including these proton-capture reactions in simulations of convective-reactive burning. This work suggests that excluding their contribution can lead to inaccurate modeling of the dynamics and nucleosynthesis in advanced stellar evolutionary phases. Such results will need to be confirmed by new 1D stellar simulations and 3D hydrodynamics models.",

The main phases of six geomagnetic storms occurring in the year 2023 (ascending phase of the present solar cycle) are considered for this study. The ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) measurements derived from GPS receivers covering the Antarctic region are used for probing the electron density perturbations during these events. Auroral precipitation maps are shown to illustrate the locations of the GPS stations relative to particle precipitation. SuperDARN maps are shown to understand the effects of plasma convection over these locations. Correlation between the enhanced TEC observations with the auroral precipitation (R $\\sim$ 0.31) and the plasma convection (R $\\sim$ 0.88) reveals that the latter is more responsible for causing significant enhancements in the diurnal maximum values of TEC over the Antarctic region in comparison to the former. Therefore, this work shows correlation studies between two physical processes and ionospheric density enhancements over the under-explored south polar region under strong levels of geomagnetic activity during 2023.",

Using photometric data from the TESS Full-Frame-Images we have performed a transit search for exoplanets with post-main sequence hosts to search for the imprints of these impacts on the giant planet population. We detect 130 short period planets and candidates, thirty-three of which are newly discovered candidates, from a sample of 456,941 post-main sequence stars spanning the evolutionary stages from the end of the main sequence to the bottom of the red giant branch. We measure an occurrence rate of $0.28 \\pm 0.04$% for short period giant planets orbiting post-main sequence stars. We also measure occurrence rates for two stellar sub-populations, measuring values of $0.35 \\pm 0.05$% for a sub-population representing the earliest stages of post-main sequence evolution and $0.11^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$% for a sub-population of more evolved stars. We show that the giant planet occurrence rate decreases with increasing stellar evolution stage, with a larger occurrence rate decrease observed for shorter period planets. Our results are clear evidence that the population of short period giant planets is being sculpted by the post-main sequence evolution of the host stars, and we conclude that this is most likely through the destruction of these giant planets through the increased strength of planet-star tidal interactions resulting in the rapid tidal decay of the planets' orbits.",

      "abstract": "Novel Numerical Methods for Accurate Space Thermal Analysis: Enforcing View Factors and Modeling Diffuse Reflectivity Bernat Frangi Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Accurate thermal analysis is crucial for modern spacecraft, driving demand for reliable modeling tools. This research advances space thermal modeling by improving the simulation accuracy and efficiency of radiative heat transfer, the dominant mode of heat exchange in space. To this end, we incorporate diffuse reflectivity using the Gebhart method, which computes radiative exchange factors (REFs) from geometric view factors. The view factors, obtained via Monte Carlo ray tracing (MCRT), require post-processing to mitigate statistical errors. Critically, existing correction schemes cannot simultaneously enforce closure and reciprocity for open systems. This research addresses this gap by proposing two novel enforcement methods: (i) a least-squares optimization with non-negativity rectification (NNR) and small positive value avoidance (SPVA), and (ii) an iterative enforcement algorithm. To ensure consistency across different discretization levels, this work also introduces the multi-node surface model relations to formalize the connection between sub-face, face, and node representations of view factors and REFs. A simple case study demonstrates a substantial reduction in mean absolute error (MAE): the least-squares method achieves an 81% MAE reduction, while the iterative method offers the best balance of accuracy (56% MAE reduction) and computational efficiency. A second case study shows that including diffuse reflections decreases the steady-state temperature of a plate by $4^{\\circ}C$, reinforcing that reflected radiation reduces net absorption. This work introduces and validates computationally efficient methods for integrating diffuse reflectivity into space thermal analyses and for consistently coupling multi-node surface radiative models. The results enable more accurate and robust thermal predictions for spacecraft systems.",

Wu Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Homodyne Quadrature interferometers (HoQI) are an interferometric displacement sensing scheme proven to have excellent noise performance, making them a strong candidate for sensing and control schemes in gravitational wave detector seismic isolation. Like many interferometric schemes, HoQIs are prone to nonlinear effects when measuring displacements. These nonlinearities, if left unsuppressed, would substantially limit the use cases of HoQIs. This paper first shows a means of measuring and quantifying nonlinearities using a working HoQI and a mechanical resonator. We then demonstrate a method for real-time correction of these nonlinearities and several approaches for accurately calibrating the correction technique. By correcting in real time, we remove one of the biggest obstacles to including HoQIs in upgrades to future gravitational wave detectors. Finally, we discuss how to post correct data from HoQIs, suppressing even further the nonlinearity-induced errors, broadening the appeal of such sensors to other applications where measurement data can be reconstructed after the fact. We demonstrate all of this on a working HoQI system and show the measured suppression of nonlinear effects from each of these methods. Our work makes HoQIs a more broadly applicable tool for displacement sensing.",

Catalogs and code available at this https URL Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We re-examine the expected yield of Gaia astrometric planet detections using updated models for giant-planet occurrence, the local stellar population, and Gaia's demonstrated astrometric precision. Our analysis combines a semi-analytic model that clarifies key scaling relations with more realistic Monte Carlo simulations. We predict $7{,}500 \\pm 2{,}100$ planet discoveries in the 5-year dataset (DR4) and $120{,}000 \\pm 22{,}000$ over the full 10-year mission (DR5), with the dominant error arising from uncertainties in giant-planet occurrence. We evaluate the sensitivity of these forecasts to the detection threshold and the desired precision for measurements of planet masses and orbital parameters. Roughly $1{,}900 \\pm 540$ planets in DR4 and $38{,}000 \\pm 7{,}300$ planets in DR5 should have masses and orbital periods determined to better than $20$%. Most detections will be super-Jupiters ($3$ - $13 M_{\\rm J}$) on $2$ - $5$AU orbits around GKM-type stars ($0.4$ - $1.3 M_\\odot$) within $500$ pc. Unresolved binary stars will lead to spurious planet detections, but we estimate that genuine planets will outnumber them by a factor of $5$ or more. An exception is planets around M-dwarfs with $a < 1$AU, for which the false-positive rate is expected to be about $50$%. To support community preparation for upcoming data releases, we provide mock catalogs of Gaia exoplanets and planet-impostor binaries.",

Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will commence full-scale operations in 2026, yielding an unprecedented volume of astronomical images. Constructing an astronomical catalog, a table of imaged stars, galaxies, and their properties, is a fundamental step in most scientific workflows based on astronomical image data. Traditional deterministic cataloging methods lack statistical coherence as cataloging is an ill-posed problem, while existing probabilistic approaches suffer from computational inefficiency, inaccuracy, or the inability to perform inference with multiband coadded images, the primary output format for LSST images. In this article, we explore a recently developed Bayesian inference method called neural posterior estimation (NPE) as an approach to cataloging. NPE leverages deep learning to achieve both computational efficiency and high accuracy. When evaluated on the DC2 Simulated Sky Survey -- a highly realistic synthetic dataset designed to mimic LSST data -- NPE systematically outperforms the standard LSST pipeline in light source detection, flux measurement, star/galaxy classification, and galaxy shape measurement. Additionally, NPE provides well-calibrated posterior approximations. These promising results, obtained using simulated data, illustrate the potential of NPE in the absence of model misspecification. Although some degree of model misspecification is inevitable in the application of NPE to real LSST images, there are a variety of strategies to mitigate its effects.",

The code used in this work is available at this https URL Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Precise radial velocity (RV) measurements are a crucial tool for exoplanet discovery and characterization. Today, the majority of these measurements are derived from Echelle spectra in the optical wavelength region using cross-correlation techniques. Although for certain stars these approaches can produce RVs with sub-1 m~s$^{-1}$ measurement errors, for many others, we are now in a regime where instrumental precision is fundamentally below the intrinsic RV variations of the star that result from astrophysical processes that can be correlated in both time and wavelength. We explore new methods for measuring exoplanet orbital parameters that take advantage of the fact that RV data sets are fundamentally multi-wavelength. By analyzing NEID extremely precise radial velocity (EPRV) data of three known exoplanet systems, we show that fitting a single Keplerian model to multi-wavelength RVs can produce a factor of 1.5 -- 6.8 better $M_p \\sin i$ uncertainties compared to fitting RVs that are derived from a weighted average across wavelength.",

However, the spatial variation of this amplification capacity on the Moon remains unclear. Here, we numerically simulate the lunar response to GWs by fully considering the fluctuant topography and laterally heterogeneous interior structures. Our results show that most regions on the Moon can amplify GWs with a ratio over 2, a finding significantly higher than previous estimations. Particularly, the amplification ratio can even reach factors of tens at the resonant frequency of ~0.015 Hz on the highlands surrounding the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin, where the regional crust is the thickest. Our findings establish the thick-crust regions as critical zones of GW amplification, which is essential for future landing site selection and instrumental setting for GW detection on the Moon.",

Speagle, Dang Pham Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) This decade has seen the first measurements of extrasolar planetary obliquities, characterizing how an exoplanet's spin axis is oriented relative to its orbital axis. These measurements are enabled by combining projected rotational velocities, planetary rotation periods, and astrometric orbits for directly-imaged super-Jupiters. This approach constrains both the spin axis and orbital inclination relative to the line of sight, allowing obliquity measurements for individual systems and offering new insights into their formation. To test whether these super-Jupiters form more like scaled-up planets or scaled-down stars, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework to infer their population-level obliquity distribution. Using a single-parameter Fisher distribution, we compare two models: a planet-like formation scenario ($\\kappa=5$) predicting moderate alignment, versus a brown dwarf-like formation scenario ($\\kappa=0$) predicting isotropic obliquities. Based on a sample of four young super-Jupiter systems, we find early evidence favoring the isotropic case with a Bayes factor of 15, consistent with turbulent fragmentation.",

Huang, Y.-Y. Chang, A. G. Sreejith, K. France, L. C. Chang, W.-H. Ip Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) in close orbits around early-type stars provide natural laboratories for studying atmospheric escape and star-planet interactions under extreme irradiation and wind conditions. The near-ultraviolet (NUV) regime is particularly sensitive to extended upper atmospheric and magnetospheric structures. We investigate whether star-planet interactions in the WASP-189 system could plausibly account for the early ingress feature suggested by NUV transit fitting models. We analyzed three NUV transits of WASP-189b observed as part of the Colorado Ultraviolet Transit Experiment (CUTE), which employs a 6U CubeSat dedicated to exoplanet spectroscopy. To explore whether the observed transit asymmetry could plausibly arise from a magnetospheric bow shock (MBS), we performed magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations using representative stellar wind velocities and planetary atmospheric densities. During Visit 3, we identified an approximately 31.5-minute phase offset that is consistent with an early ingress. Our MHD simulations indicate that with a wind speed of 573 km s-1 and an upper atmospheric density of about 4.6e-11 kg m-3, a higher-density zone due to compression can form ahead of the planet within five planetary radii where the fast-mode Mach number falls below ~0.56, even without a MBS. Shock cooling and crossing time estimates suggest that such a pileup could produce detectable NUV absorption. Our results indicate that while MBS formation is feasible for WASP-189b, low stellar-wind speeds favor NUV-detectable magnetic pileups over classical bow shocks and enhance the potential detectability of early-ingress signatures.",

      "abstract": "Spectroscopic analysis of hydrogen and silicon in bright fireballs: New insights into meteoroid composition V. Vojáček, J. Borovička, P. Spurný Accepted by Astronomy & Astrophysics journal Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We present a study of the high-temperature spectral component in meteor fireballs, with a particular focus on neutral hydrogen at 656.28 nm and ionised silicon doublet at 634.71 nm and 637.14 nm. By analysing spectra from the European Fireball Network (EN) that exhibit H$\\alpha$ and Si~II emissions, we investigated the relationship between H and Si abundances across different meteoroid types. The plasma temperature of the high-temperature component remains independent of meteor velocity. This allows us to directly compare relative intensities of volatile hydrogen with less volatile silicon in bodies with different velocities. Our results confirmed that the H/Si value remains largely independent of meteor velocity. We show a positive correlation with photometric mass for cometary meteoroids, suggesting that larger bodies better preserve their volatile content, namely hydrogen. This correlation persists across the meteor showers, showing a physical process related to volatile preservation rather than specific parent body composition. Our data suggest that the abundance of hydrogen in large cometary meteoroids is not only higher than in CI chondrites, but is also comparable to or higher than the measured abundances in small particles of dust from Halley's comet, depending on the assumed plasma conditions. This work brought new constraints on the distribution and preservation of volatile elements in Solar System bodies and new insights into the potential delivery mechanisms of water to Earth. The prevalence of hydrogen in larger cometary meteoroids supports models where comets could be significant contributors to Earth's volatile inventory.",

Coleman, Sierk E. van Terwisga Accepted for publication in MNRAS. 7 pages, 4 figures Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) FUV radiation from massive stars launch photoevaporative winds from the outer regions of protoplanetary discs around other stars, removing gas and dust. Observations have identified a relation between the median dust disc mass and the external UV field strength. Here we use disc evolutionary models to explore how this relation evolves over time, and with respect to other stellar and disc properties. We find that the slope for the relationship $\\lambda_{\\rm UV}$ flattens over time as populations age, possibly explaining the differences seen between the L1641-N and L1641-S clusters in Orion A. We determine that $\\lambda_{\\rm UV}$ depends on the stellar mass where more massive stars exhibit steeper gradients than their lesser counterparts, in agreement with the differences seen between Herbig and T Tauri stars. Additionally, the strength of the mechanism for angular momentum transport, either viscosity or MHD disc winds, is found to significantly affect $\\lambda_{\\rm UV}$ with stronger $\\alpha$ values reducing $\\lambda_{\\rm UV}$ due to more material accreting on to the central stars in weaker UV environments. Estimates of $\\lambda_{\\rm UV}$ from observations of L1641 place preliminary constraints on $\\alpha$ to be between $10^{-3.5}$--$10^{-2.5}$, consistent with literature estimates. Further observations in different regions and better classifications of stellar masses will allow us to place stringent constraints on disc evolution properties, improving our understanding of how protoplanetary discs evolve.",

Pfeil Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Coagulation of dust particles in protoplanetary disks is the first step on the journey to the formation of planets. The surface free energy (SFE) of the dust particles determines the effectiveness of particles sticking to each other after collision, as well as the critical collision velocity above which fragmentation will occur. Studies of SFE have focused on the simplest silicate, silica, usually at standard temperature and pressure. However, protoplanetary dust grains have a wide variety of mineralogical compositions, temperatures, and a low-pressure environment lacking in water vapor. We perform molecular dynamics simulations using a ReaxFF-type potential of the SFE of silica, albite, and anorthite at temperatures ranging from 30 to 700 K in a true vacuum. We find that the SFE drops by tens of percent with increasing temperature or shifting to more complex silicate compositions. More dramatically, we find that the values of the SFE in a vacuum are two orders of magnitude higher than those usually measured in terrestrial laboratories. Our results confirm previous work that suggests that hydroxylation by monolayers of water produces this reduction in SFE in experiments. The coagulation of dust grains thus appears to depend critically on the cleanliness of their surfaces, as well as their temperature and composition.",

However, while second- or even third-order resonances were deemed unlikely due to their weaker strength, they have been observed in some planetary systems (e.g. TOI-178 bc: 5:3, TOI-1136 ef: 7:5, TRAPPIST-1 bcd: 8:5-5:3). We performed $>6,000$ Type-I simulations of multi-planet systems that mimic the observed {\\it Kepler} sample in terms of stellar mass, planet size, multiplicity, and intra-system uniformity over a parameter space encompassing transitional and truncated disks. We found that Type-I migration coupled with a disk inner edge can indeed produce second- and third-order resonances (in a state of libration) in $\\sim 10\\%$ and 2\\% of resonant-chain systems, respectively. Moreover, the relative occurrence of first- and second-order MMRs in our simulations is consistent with observations (e.g. 3:2 is more common than 2:1; while second-order 5:3 is more common than 7:5). The formation of higher-order MMRs favors slower disk migration and a smaller outer planet mass. Higher-order resonances do not have to form with the help of a Laplace-like three-body resonance as was proposed for TRAPPIST-1. Instead, the formation of higher-order resonance is assisted by breaking a pre-existing first-order resonance, which generates small but non-zero initial eccentricities ($e\\approx10^{-3}$ to 10$^{-2}$). We predict that 1) librating higher-order resonances have higher equilibrium $e$ ($\\sim 0.1$); 2) are more likely found as an isolated pair in an otherwise first-order chain; 3) more likely emerge in the inner pairs of a chain.",
