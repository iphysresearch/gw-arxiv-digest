      "abstract": "Bayesian optimisation for Bayesian evidence (BOBE) -- a fast and efficient likelihood emulator for model selection Nathan Cohen, Jan Hamann, Ameek Malhotra Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) The formalism of Bayesian model selection provides a very elegant way of ranking different physical models in terms of how compatible they are with a given set of observed data. However, its practical application is often hampered by the challenge of having to compute the Bayesian evidence - a multi-dimensional integral over the product of likelihood and prior probability. This usually necessitates a large number of function calls to the likelihood, which may become prohibitive in case of \"slow\", costly to evaluate likelihoods. A possible solution to this problem lies in approximating the slow full likelihood by a fast emulated likelihood. In this paper, we introduce BOBE (Bayesian Optimisation for Bayesian Evidence), a method to construct a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)-based emulator. BOBE utilises a Bayesian Optimisation algorithm designed specifically to (i) provide a realistic estimate of the emulator's uncertainty and its impact on the evidence calculation, and (ii) minimise the number of likelihood evaluations required in order to meet a given evidence accuracy goal. We apply it to a number of toy examples as well as actual cosmological likelihoods, and demonstrate that training the emulator to a sufficient accuracy takes a factor of $O(10^3)$ fewer direct likelihood evaluations than would be needed if one were to directly compute the evidence integral via nested sampling. BOBE's overhead is independent of the likelihood computation time $t_L$, making it particularly useful for \"expensive\" likelihoods with $t_L \\gtrsim 1$~s. BOBE is written in Python, supports MPI parallelisation, takes advantage of automatic differentiation and just-in-time-compilation provided by JAX, can straightforwardly be implemented with cosmological data analysis frameworks such as Cobaya, and is available for download from this https URL.",

We find that the extrapolated linear density contrast computed from the spherical collapse model is suppressed when the strength of momentum transfer is increased. Using the Sheth-Tormen mass function, the cluster number counts are computed. The minimum mass limit in the mass integration for each redshift bin is determined by matching the predicted number counts from the $\\Lambda$CDM model with the result from eROSITA surveys. We find that the number of clusters is maximal at a higher redshift bin, and the number of clusters in a maximum redshift bin is enhanced when the strength of momentum and energy transfers increases due to the reduction of extrapolated linear density contrast. Setting the parameters of the dark energy model with momentum coupling according to the observational constraints in \\cite{bestfit}, the predicted number counts from the coupled dark energy is larger than the result from eROSITA surveys. The statistical analysis yields a $p$-value of 0.189 for the proposed model relative to $\\Lambda$CDM. Consequently, there is no statistically significant evidence of an improved fit over the standard $\\Lambda$CDM framework based on the eROSITA cluster number counts.",

Lozanov, Misao Sasaki, Jan Tränkle 11 pages + appendices, 5 figures Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Under certain conditions, the oscillating inflaton condensate filling the Universe after inflation can fragment and form so-called oscillons. These long-lived soliton-like field configurations can dominate the Universe for several $e$-folds of expansion, leading to an early matter-dominated phase preceding the standard radiation era. In this paper we show how the rapid final decay of the oscillons leads to an enhanced production of induced gravitational waves, whose energy density can saturate the observational bound on the effective number of relativistic species. We leverage this bound to constrain the inflaton mass, cubic, and quartic self-coupling in generic models that admit oscillon formation, providing novel and complementary constraints in regions of parameter space that are inaccessible with cosmic microwave background observations alone.",

To enhance sensitivity to this targeted population, we incorporate a redshift-corrected population model informed by radio observations of Galactic double neutron star systems. The search identifies a significant trigger with a false-alarm rate of one per fifty years and a network signal-to-noise ratio of 9.7. This trigger was first reported in low-latency processing as S231109ci and subsequently listed in the GWTC-4.0 catalog as GW231109_235456, a subthreshold candidate. Accounting for a trials factor of five arising from four previous searches in GWTC-4.0 and this new search, the false-alarm rate of the candidate is approximately one per ten years. If the event is of astrophysical origin, the inferred source properties indicate component masses of 1.40 to 2.24 solar masses for the primary and 0.97 to 1.49 solar masses for the secondary, yielding a total mass of 2.95 solar masses with an uncertainty of plus 0.38 and minus 0.07 solar masses. The event is localized to a region of 450 square degrees enclosing ninety percent probability at a luminosity distance of 165 megaparsecs with an uncertainty of plus 70 and minus 69 megaparsecs. Assuming the signal arises from a binary neutron star merger, we estimate the local merger rate to lie between 53 and 342 per cubic gigaparsec per year.",

Ferreira, Carlos García-García Accepted and forthcoming in PRD Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Current cosmological data seem to show that dark energy is evolving in time and that it possibly crossed the phantom divide in the past. So far the only theories that lead to such a behavior involve a non-trivial coupling between dark energy, in the form of a scalar field, and the gravitational or matter sector. We show that there is another possibility involving both a non-trivial kinetic sector in a cubic Galileon theory and a scalar field potential that breaks the Galileon shift symmetry, which can lead to a similar phenomenology on large scales. We perform a full Bayesian analysis using the latest cosmological data, including DESI DR2 BAO measurements, type Ia SNe measurements from DESY5, Union3, and Pantheon+, and CMB data from Planck and ACT. We find that it is statistically strongly favored over a Universe dominated by a cosmological constant (with a Bayes factor of $\\log B\\simeq 6.5$). Yet, as with other non-minimally coupled theories, it has severe ancillary gravitational effects. These can be mitigated to some extent, but as with other viable theories, the penalty is ever more elaborate scalar field models of dark energy.",

Using the prediction that these hierarchically-merged black holes have dimensionless spin magnitudes of $\\chi \\approx 0.69$, we identify a subpopulation in the gravitational-wave data consistent with a hierarchical-merger origin in dense star clusters. This subpopulation's primary mass distribution peaks at $16.7^{+3.1}_{-4.6},\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, which is approximately twice as large as its secondary mass distribution's mode ($8.0^{+29.7}_{-2.3},\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$), and its spin tilt distribution is consistent with isotropy. Our inferred secondary mass distributions imply that isolated binary evolution may still be needed to explain the entirety of the $9\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ peak. Surprisingly, we find that the rate of hierarchical mergers may evolve more steeply with redshift than the rest of the population ($98.5\\%$ credibility): the fraction of all binary black holes that are hierarchically formed at $z=0.1$ is $0.05^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$, compared to $0.17^{+0.13}_{-0.12}$ at $z=1$. This provides an explanation for the previously-discovered broadening of the effective spin distribution with redshift. Our results have implications for star cluster formation histories, as they suggest the potential existence of a high-redshift population of massive, compact clusters.",

Analyzing the latest catalog binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors, we identify a subpopulation with primary spins consistent with such hierarchical mergers.

Medinaceli 17 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables, including appendices Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Weak lensing surveys require accurate correction for the point spread function (PSF) when measuring galaxy shapes. For a diffraction-limited PSF, as arises in space-based missions, this correction depends on each galaxy SED. In the Euclid mission, galaxy SED reconstruction, a tasks of the photometric-redshift processing function (PHZ PF), relies on broad- and medium-band ancillary photometry. The limited wavelength sampling of the Euclid VIS passband and signal-to-noise ratio may affect the reconstruction accuracy and translate into biases in the weak lensing measurements. In this study, we present the methodology, which is employed in the Euclid PHZ PF, for reconstructing galaxy SEDs at 55 wavelengths, sampling the VIS passband every 10 nm, and we assess whether it fulfils the accuracy requirements imposed on the Euclid PSF model. We employ both physics- and data-driven methods, focusing on a new approach of template-based flux correction and Gaussian processes, and we introduce an SED metric whose bias propagates into PSF quadrupole moment errors. Our findings demonstrate that Gaussian processes and template fitting meet the requirements only in specific, but complementary, redshift intervals. We therefore propose a hybrid approach, which leverages both methods. This solution proves to be effective in meeting the Euclid accuracy requirements for most of the redshift range of the survey. Finally, we investigate the impact on the SED reconstruction of a new set of 16 evenly-spaced medium-band filters for the Subaru telescope, providing quasi-spectroscopic coverage of the VIS passband. This study shows promising results, ensuring accurate SED reconstruction and meeting the mission PSF requirements. This work thus provides not only the methodological foundation of galaxy SED reconstruction in the Euclid PHZ PF, but also a roadmap for future improvements using a new medium-band survey.",

Dupke, Yolanda Jiménez-Teja Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present a comprehensive reanalysis of the dynamical state of the high-redshift galaxy cluster SPT-CL J2215-3537 (z = 1.16), using the full set of available Chandra observations to characterize the thermodynamic and morphological properties of the intracluster medium. Although previously identified as one of the most distant dynamically relaxed systems based on X-ray morphological statistics, we find compelling evidence that SPT-CL J2215-3537 displays some level of dynamical activity. This includes temperature anisotropies consistent with the first detection of a pair of core-sloshing cold fronts at z > 1. We identify a ghost cavity candidate and estimate its mechanical power as log10(Pcav/10^42 erg s^-1) = 2.66 +- 0.23, confirming that radiative cooling strongly exceeds active galactic nucleus feedback heating. We show that SPT-CL J2215-3537 is likely in a short transient phase preceding the onset of a self-regulated cooling-feedback cycle. We recalculate traditional X-ray morphological parameters and discuss how non-self-similar evolution of parameters sensitive to the surface brightness cuspiness can bias dynamical classifications at high redshift.",

The required Lyman continuum (LyC) photon budget may naturally arise from the unexpectedly high galaxy number densities revealed by JWST, reducing the need for scenarios invoking very high LyC escape fractions ($f_{\\rm esc}\\gtrsim0.2$) or dominant contributions from ultra-faint galaxies ($M_{\\rm UV}>-15$) in the standard $\\Lambda$CDM framework. In this work, we model the reionization history under the Early Dark Energy (EDE) paradigm -- originally proposed to ease the Hubble tension -- which also explains the observed over-abundance of high-$z$ galaxies without extreme star formation efficiencies. The EDE model yields reionization histories consistent with current constraints while requiring only moderate LyC escape fractions and UV luminosity densities ($f_{\\rm esc}\\sim 0.05-0.1$, $M_{\\rm UV}\\lesssim -17$ to $-15$). Our results suggest that, once key astrophysical parameters are better constrained, the reionization history could serve as an independent and complementary probe of EDE cosmologies.",

Trigui Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The cosmological principle assumes the isotropy of the Universe at large scales. It is a foundational assumption in the $\\Lambda$CDM model, which is the current standard model of cosmology. Recent tensions give legitimacy to investigating the possibility of anisotropies in the Universe. The large sky coverage achieved by the Zwicky Transient Facility survey (ZTF) allows us to test the veracity of the cosmological principle using observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). In this article, we develop a methodology to measure potential anisotropies in the Hubble constant $H_0$. We test our method on realistic simulations of the second data release (DR2) of ZTF SNe Ia in which we introduce a dipole. We develop an unbiased method both to introduce a dipole in the simulations and to recover it. We test a potential $H_0$ dependency of our method while varying the dipole amplitude. We analyse the impact of introducing large-scale structures in the simulations and the efficiency of using a volume-limited sample, which is an unbiased subsample of the ZTF SNe Ia sample. Finally, we build an error model applied to the recovered dipole amplitude ($\\Delta H_0$) and its direction ($\\alpha_0$, $\\delta_0$). Our analysis allows us to recover a dipole with an error on the amplitude of $0.33\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$, and uncertainties of $3.4^\\circ$ and $6.1^\\circ$ on the right ascension and declination, respectively, for an initial dipole amplitude of $\\Delta H_0 = 3\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$. The resulting dipole is independent of the chosen $H_0$ value and sky coverage. This paper paves the way for a future precise ZTF dipole investigation.",

We analysed 15 years of Fermi-LAT data, constructing UGRB intensity maps in ten energy bins (0.5-1000 GeV), and cross-correlated them with KiDS-Legacy shear in six tomographic bins. The measurements were performed using angular power spectra estimated with the pseudo-$C_\\ell$ method. No significant cross-correlation is found.

Strategically located near the equator at Kutunse, Ghana, the telescope offers nearly full-sky coverage (-77 degrees to +88 degrees declination), making it a valuable asset for time-domain astronomy, transient surveys, and global VLBI networks. This work documents the technical evolution of the facility, including beam-waveguide optics, dual-polarization C-band receivers (5 and 6.7 GHz), and recent backend upgrades culminating in the integration of a hydrogen maser, wideband ROACH2 system, and enhanced control and pointing infrastructure. We report early science results from high-resolution spectral-line observations of 6.7 GHz Class II methanol masers, pulse timing of PSR J0835-4510 (Vela), and successful VLBI fringe detections on intercontinental baselines. Simulations and commissioning tests confirm high aperture efficiency (>77%), low sidelobe levels, and robust time stability across the signal chain. These outcomes validate the GRAO's readiness for both standalone and networked operations. As the first operational node in West Africa contributing to the African VLBI Network, GRAO plays a critical role in advancing the continent's participation in global radio astronomy, capacity building, and the preparatory phase of the Square Kilometre Array.",

To simulate this emission, jet dynamics in galaxy clusters must be coupled to electron spectral modelling. We run magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a single AGN jet outburst in a Perseus-like galaxy cluster and adopt a sub-grid model for the acceleration of cosmic ray protons and electrons at unresolved internal shocks in the jet. We evolve cosmic ray electron spectra along Lagrangian trajectories using the Fokker-Planck solver Crest and compute the non-thermal emission using Crayon+. The resulting total electron spectrum reaches a steady-state slope at high momenta, with a gradually decreasing normalization over time, while the lower-momentum portion continues to resemble a freely cooling spectrum. The interaction of the jets with the turbulent cluster environment inflates lobes which rise buoyantly, induce amplification of the magnetic fields and uplift old cosmic ray populations in the wake of the bubbles. We connect radio spectral indices to electron injection ages: at a given radio frequency, weaker magnetic fields are illuminated by higher momenta electrons, whose age is determined by the last injection event. On the other hand, stronger magnetic fields are illuminated by lower momenta electrons, whose age is determined by the maximum energy injection event in the past. This powerful approach allows us to relate the underlying MHD properties to electron spectra and the resulting radio synchrotron emission, thereby enabling us to infer the underlying physics from observed radio properties.",

Schmidt, Ziang Yan, the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration 22 pages, 11 figures, for submission to MNRAS Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Most LSST extragalactic science will rely on photometric redshifts (photo-$z$) to extract distance information for the galaxies. However, an incomplete or non-representative training set can introduce bias into photo-$z$ estimation. It is necessary to understand how various forms of training set imperfection, such as incompleteness and non-trivial spectroscopic target selection, affect photo-$z$ estimation algorithms, and to identify metrics best-suited to quantify the impact. This work aims to systematically study metrics for diagnosing how various photo-$z$ methods react to certain types of training set incompleteness and non-representativeness. We use methods available through the open-source Python library Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers (RAIL) to systematically test the algorithms CMNN, GPz, FlexZBoost, and PZFlow on mock training data degraded in accordance with several existing spectroscopic sky surveys, as well as under conditions of inverse redshift incompleteness, which approximately mimics observed patterns of incompleteness at high redshift. We employ the algorithm TrainZ as a control. Finally, we quantify photo-$z$ algorithm performance using a variety of statistical metrics implemented externally to RAIL. We determine that the Kullback-Liebler Divergence, Wasserstein Distance, and Probability Integral Transform are particularly informative metrics with which to assess the impact of training set imperfection on algorithmic performance. We also find that inverse redshift incompleteness effects alone lack the complexity to realistically represent anticipated training data.",

As part of the POLAMI program, we have conducted 14 years of 1 mm and 3 mm polarization monitoring of a sample of gamma-ray-bright blazars with the IRAM 30-m telescope, complemented here with long-term optical polarimetric observations from multiple facilities. We aim to test whether current models of parsec-scale jet physics are consistent with observed multi-band polarization behavior. Using a Bayesian framework, we derive intrinsic mean flux densities and modulation indices for total flux and fractional polarization, and characterize EVPA variability using circular statistics. We then examine how these quantities reflecting variability properties across millimeter and optical bands relate to synchrotron peak frequency, jet orientation, and radio/gamma-ray luminosities. BL Lac objects exhibit, on average, higher fractional polarization and lower EVPA variability than FSRQs at all wavelengths. Fractional polarization increases with frequency, consistent with increasingly ordered magnetic fields at shorter wavelengths. BL Lacs also show more frequent alignment of EVPAs between optical and millimeter bands, whereas FSRQs display weaker coherence. EVPA variability correlates positively with radio and gamma-ray luminosities and negatively with synchrotron peak frequency, most strongly in the optical. We further find a positive correlation between EVPA spread and fractional polarization variability, suggesting a direct link between magnetic-field structure and polarization dynamics.",

Wang (NJU) 15 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Growing evidence indicates that some fast radio bursts (FRBs) reside in dense, magneto-ionic environments where extrinsic propagation effects can substantially reshape the observed signal. Within a 1D Gaussian plasma-lens framework, we show that small, monotonic variations in the incidence angle of the FRB wavefront naturally generate both downward and upward sub-burst frequency drifts. We further demonstrate that distinct lensed paths that probe different rotation measures (RMs), can produce orthogonal polarization-angle (PA) jumps at gigahertz frequencies. In this picture, a $\\sim 90^\\circ$ PA transition requires only a modest RM contrast of order a few $\\times10~\\rm{rad~m^{-2}}$ between the multiple images. The chromatic activity of FRB 20180916B-earlier and narrower activity windows at higher frequencies-can be explained as preferential magnification near the outer caustic. Finally, the intrinsic resolution of a plasma lens provides an upper limit on the transverse emission size: lenses located close to the source yield magnetospheric-scale constraints and offer a practical means of discriminating between inner- and outer-magnetospheric emission scenarios. These results suggest that plasma lensing could account for multiple complex observational features of FRBs and may play a non-negligible role in modulating their observable properties.",

In this work we generalise the super-comoving variables used in studies of cosmological structure formation to our local spherical flow model, which make it significantly easier to derive analytical solutions and analyse the interactions of more complex flows with the background. We show that a wide class of solutions to the local spherical flow model can be obtained via a mapping from the corresponding solutions in regular Cartesian flows. The rescaling of time in the transformation results in a modification of the linear instabilities that can occur in spherical flows, causing them to have a time dependent growth rate in the physical time coordinate, and can prevent slower instabilities from operating. Finally, we show that the small scale flows in isotropic contraction/expansion can be mapped directly to Cartesian, inviscid, incompressible hydrodynamics, meaning that one expects a form of rescaled Kolmogorov-turbulence at the small scale of isotropically contracting/expanding flows.",

Sánchez-Conde, Alejandra Aguirre-Santaella Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We have used Auriga -- a set of state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of Milky Way-size systems -- to study the impact of baryons on the Galactic subhalo population. A DM-only run counterpart of Auriga allows us to compare results with and without baryons. We repopulate the original suites with low-mass subhalos orders of magnitude lighter than the mass resolution limit, starting from a detailed characterization of Auriga data in the well-resolved subhalo mass range. The survival of low-mass subhalos to tidal forces is unclear and under debate nowadays, thus in our study we stay agnostic and consider two different levels of subhalo resilience to tidal stripping ('fragile' and 'resilient' subhalos). We find baryons to alter the Galactic substructure significantly, by decreasing its overall abundance by a factor $\\sim2.4$ (fragile) and $\\sim1.9$ (resilient) and subhalo concentration -- here defined in terms of maximum circular velocity -- by $\\sim1.5$ with respect to the DM-only scenario. This has important consequences for indirect searches of DM. As an example, we investigated the case of using unidentified gamma-ray sources to set constraints on the DM particle properties, assuming some of them may be dark satellites. We find the DM annihilation cross-section constraints to worsen by a factor $\\sim3.6$ in the most realistic scenario of including baryons, compared to DM-only simulations in the 'fragile' setup. Yet, a stronger resilience of subhalos to tidal stripping improves these DM limits by a factor $\\sim4.5$ and $\\sim10$ compared to the DM-only and hydrodynamical 'fragile' cases, respectively. Our results show the importance of including baryons to properly characterize the Galactic subhalo population, as well as to propose the most optimal subhalo search strategies, not only via its potential DM annihilation products but also through their gravitational signatures.",

Lett. 136, 021001 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present the tightest cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing constraints to date on the growth of structure by combining CMB lensing measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and \\textit{Planck}. Each of these surveys individually provides lensing measurements with similarly high statistical power, achieving signal-to-noise ratios of approximately 40. The combined lensing bandpowers represent the most precise CMB lensing power spectrum measurement to date with a signal-to-noise ratio of 61 and an amplitude of $A_\\mathrm{lens}^\\mathrm{recon} = 1.025 \\pm 0.017$ with respect to the theory prediction from the best-fit CMB \\textit{Planck}-ACT cosmology. The bandpowers from all three lensing datasets, analyzed jointly, yield a $1.6\\%$ measurement of the parameter combination $S_8^\\mathrm{CMBL} \\equiv \\sigma_8\\,(\\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.25} = 0.825^{+0.015}_{-0.013}$. Including Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data improves the constraint on the amplitude of matter fluctuations to $\\sigma_8 = 0.829 \\pm 0.009$ (a $1.1\\%$ determination). When combining with uncalibrated supernovae from \\texttt{Pantheon+}, we present a $4\\%$ sound-horizon-independent estimate of $H_0=66.4\\pm2.5\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}} $. The joint lensing constraints on structure growth and present-day Hubble rate are fully consistent with a $\\Lambda$CDM model fit to the primary CMB data from \\textit{Planck} and ACT. While the precise upper limit is sensitive to the choice of data and underlying model assumptions, when varying the neutrino mass sum within the $\\Lambda\\mathrm{CDM}$ cosmological model, the combination of primary CMB, BAO and CMB lensing drives the probable upper limit for the mass sum towards lower values, comparable to the minimum mass prior required by neutrino oscillation experiments.",

We create mock observations of the galaxies ($5 \\leq z \\leq 8$) in ASTRID, and find seventeen which fit the color and size criteria of LRDs. These LRDs are galaxies with high stellar masses ($\\rm log(M_*/M_{\\odot}) \\geq 9.7$), and massive black holes ($\\rm log(M_{BH}/M_{\\odot}) \\geq 6.8$). The host galaxies are dense, with stellar half mass radii ($\\rm 325\\,pc \\leq r_{{\\rm half},*} \\leq 620\\,pc$), and dust attenuation in the F444W band above 1.25. Their star formation has been recently quenched. They host relatively bright AGN that are dust-obscured and contribute significantly to the rest-frame optical red slope and have relatively low luminosity in the rest-frame ultraviolet, where the host galaxy's stars are more dominant. These LRDs are in an evolutionary phase of miniquenching that is the result of AGN feedback from their massive black holes. The LRDs in ASTRID are bright with F444W magnitudes of $23.5-25.5$. The less massive and fainter galaxies in ASTRID lack the dust concentration necessary to produce the red slope of an LRD, though this could be an effect of limited resolution. Most of the highest Eddington black holes are not LRDs due to insufficient dust attenuation from their host galaxies, which are also experiencing relatively high star formation rates. This results in their spectra being too flat, despite their highly accreting black holes.",

Magnier, Armin Rest, Qinan Wang 21 pages, 10 figures; published in MNRAS Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are standardisable candles: their peak magnitudes can be corrected for correlations between light curve properties and their luminosities to precisely estimate distances. Understanding SN Ia standardisation across wavelength improves methods for correcting SN Ia magnitudes. Using 150 SNe Ia from the Foundation Supernova Survey and Young Supernova Experiment, we present the first study focusing on SN Ia standardisation properties in the z band. Straddling the optical and near-infrared, SN Ia light in the z band is less sensitive to dust extinction and can be collected alongside the optical on CCDs. Pre-standardisation, SNe Ia exhibit less residual scatter in z-band peak magnitudes than in the g and r bands. SNe Ia peak z-band magnitudes still exhibit a significant dependence on light-curve shape. Post-standardisation, the z-band Hubble diagram has a total scatter of RMS $ = 0.195$ mag. We infer a z-band mass step of $\\gamma_{z} = -0.105 \\pm 0.031$ mag, which is consistent within $1\\sigma$ of that estimated from gri data, assuming $R_{V} = 2.61$. When assuming different $R_{V}$ values for high and low mass host galaxies, the z-band and optical mass steps remain consistent within $1\\sigma$. Based on current statistical precision, these results suggest dust reddening cannot fully explain the mass step. SNe Ia in the z band exhibit complementary standardisability properties to the optical that can improve distance estimates. Understanding these properties is important for the upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory and Nancy G. Roman Space Telescope, which will probe the rest-frame z band to redshifts 0.1 and 1.8.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We investigate the cosmological constraints from the void-lensing cross-correlation assuming the $w$CDM model for the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) photometric survey. Using Jiutian simulations, we construct a mock galaxy catalog to $z=3$ covering 100 deg$^2$, which incorporates the instrumental and observational effects of the CSST. We divide the galaxy sample into seven photometric-redshift (photo-$z$) tomographic bins and identify 2D voids within each bin using the Voronoi tessellation and watershed algorithm. We measure the angular cross-power spectrum between the void distribution and the weak lensing signal, and estimate the covariance matrix via jackknife resampling combined with pseudo-$C_{\\ell}$ approach to account for the partial sky correction. We employ the Halo Void Dust Model (HVDM) to model the void-matter cross-power spectrum and adopt the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique to implement the constraints on the cosmological and void parameters. We find that our method can accurately extract the cosmological information, and the constraint accuracies of some cosmological parameters from the void-lensing analysis are comparable or even tighter than the weak lensing only case. This demonstrates that the void-lensing serves as an effective cosmological probe and a valuable complement to galaxy photometric surveys, particularly for the Stage-IV surveys targeting the high-redshift Universe.",

We also develop a binned bispectrum estimator that works directly using maps of different frequency channels, capable of determining the bispectrum of multiple components at the same time, shifting the traditional approach to non-Gaussianity estimation from a cleaned map to the component separation step, for a better handling of foreground uncertainty. We test our method on 400 E and B polarization simulations based on the LiteBIRD experiment, containing the two main sources of contamination for CMB polarization experiments: polarized dust and synchrotron emission. We show that the bispectrum does not improve the precision of the power spectrum estimation or of the spectral parameters. However, we are capable of recovering the correct 3-point correlator of the foregrounds and standard constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity in a coherent multi-frequency and multi-component framework. The advantage of our approach is that it combines data in an optimal way accounting for the power spectrum and the bispectrum of the various components, which is not true for the standard approach.",

Wuensche, Chang Feng, Edmar C. Gurjão Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Context. Building on the transformative success of optical redshift surveys, the emerging technique of neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping (IM) offers a novel probe of large-scale structure (LSS) growth and the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe. Aims. We present cosmological forecasts for the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from Integrated Neutral Gas Observations (BINGO), a pioneering HI IM experiment, quantifying its potential to constrain the Planck-calibrated $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology and extensions to the $w_0w_a$CDM dark energy model. Methods. For BINGO's Phase~1 configuration, we simulate the HI IM signal using a lognormal model and incorporate three dominant systematics: foreground residuals, thermal noise, and beam resolution effects. Using Bayesian inference, we derive joint constraints on six cosmological parameters ($\\Omega_b h^2$, $\\Omega_c h^2$, $100\\theta_s$, $n_s$, $\\ln 10^{10} A_s$, and $\\tau_r$) alongside 60 HI parameters ($b_{\\rm HI}^i$, $\\Omega_{\\rm HI}^i b_{\\rm HI}^i$) across 30 frequency channels. Results. Our results demonstrate that combining BINGO with the Planck 2018 CMB dataset tightens the confidence regions of cosmological parameters to $\\sim$40\\% the size of those from Planck alone, significantly improving the precision of parameter estimation. Furthermore, BINGO constrains the redshift evolution of HI density and delivers competitive measurements of the dark energy equation of state parameters ($w_0$, $w_a$). Conclusions. These results demonstrate BINGO's potential to extract significant cosmological information from the HI distribution and provide constraints competitive with current and future cosmological surveys.",

Hirata, Katherine Laliotis, Masaya Yamamoto, Emily Macbeth, M. A. Troxel 25 pages, 10 figures, matches version accepted by ApJ Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) For weak gravitational lensing cosmology with the forthcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, image coaddition, or construction of oversampled images from undersampled ones, is a critical step in the image processing pipeline. In the previous papers in this series, we have re-implemented the {\\sc Imcom} algorithm, which offers control over point spread functions in coadded images, and applied it to state-of-the-art image simulations for Roman. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of {\\sc Imcom} hyperparameters on the quality of measurement results. We re-coadd the same $16$ blocks ($1.75 \\times 1.75 \\,{\\rm arcmin}^2$, $2688 \\times 2688$ pixels each) from OpenUniverse2024 simulations with $26$ different configurations in each of $5$ bands. We then compare the results in terms of $12$ objective evaluation criteria, including internal diagnostics of {\\sc Imcom}, properties of coadded noise frames, measurements of injected point sources, and time consumption. We demonstrate that: i) the Cholesky kernel is the best known linear algebra strategy for {\\sc Imcom}, ii) for our measurements, a wide Gaussian target output PSF outperforms a smoothed Airy disk or a narrow Gaussian, iii) kernel-specific settings are worth considering for future coaddition, and iv) {\\sc Imcom} experimental features studied in this work are either inconsequential or detrimental. We end this paper by discussing current and next steps of {\\sc Imcom}-related studies in the context of Roman shear and clustering measurements.",

In order to verify the idea, we perform two-dimensional neutrino-radiation hydrodynamic simulations coupled with the DP production with the masses of 0.3 and 0.45\\,MeV. We find that the shock revival does not happen until the end of the simulations when $\\epsilon\\gtrsim3\\times10^{-9}$. The photon-DP mixing parameter above this value can be excluded by the failing supernova argument. Interestingly, our constraint roughly coincides with the one reported by the previous studies which adopted the post-processing framework.

A&A submitted Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Gravitationally lensed quasars are viable cosmic tools for constraining a diversity of fundamental astrophysical phenomena; They enable identification of faint, low-mass supermassive black holes, provide unique constraints on the intervening intergalactic or interstellar medium in their sightlines, and can be used to determine key cosmological quantities such as the Hubble constant, $H_0$. However, they are rare phenomena, and it has proven difficult to define efficient, unbiased selection methods.} In this study, we report the independent spectroscopic identification of a remarkable triple-lensed quasar at $z=2.67$, identified based on astrometric measurements from the {\\em Gaia} mission, previously identified in Pan-STARRS. Furthermore, a larger spectroscopic follow-up survey of {\\em Gaia}-detected candidate lensed quasars. We characterize in detail the three mirror images of the quasar and their spatial and temporal spectroscopic coverage, with focus on the emission-line properties which shows variation across sigthlines and temporal evolution over the $\\sim 11$months spectroscopic campaign. We construct a lens model of the foreground source from a combination of the multiple spectra and deep optical imaging, providing a robust halo mass of $M_{\\rm h} = (2.78 \\pm 0.05)\\times 10^{10}M_\\odot$. Based on the lens model, the time delay between each sightline is translated into an intrinsic quasar time, allowing us to construct a quasar timeseries over $\\sim18$months with monthly cadence. Over months timescales the broad emission lines vary in both velocity offset and equivalent width (EW) as well as an overall increase in ionization. This exemplary triple-lensed quasars demonstrates the viability of identifying such rare lens configurations based purely on the astrometric measurements from the {\\em Gaia} mission, which we here provide optimized selection criteria for, for future studies.",

Dawson 12 pages, 8 figures, submitted to A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Notoriously hard to detect and study, isolated neutron stars (NS) could provide valuable answers to fundamental questions about stellar evolution and explosion physics. With the upcoming Roman Space Telescope, scheduled for launch in 2026, a new and powerful channel for their detection - astrometric microlensing - will become available. We set out to create a realistic sample of simulated gravitational microlensing events as observed by Roman with the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey. We focus in particular on the population of NS lenses, which has until now been largely understudied. We use state-of-the-art Galactic models tailored for application to microlensing by compact objects. We simulate four different NS populations with Maxwellian natal kick distributions: $\\bar{v} = (150, \\ 250, \\ 350, \\ 450)$ km/s. We apply projected Roman precision, cadence, and detectability criteria. We find the parameter space $\\log_{10} t_{\\rm E}$ - $\\log_{10} \\theta_{\\rm E}$, which will be accessible to Roman observations, to be maximally efficient for classification of stellar remnants. We find a feature in this space that is characteristic to NS; using this feature, optimal samples of NS candidates can be constructed from Roman-like datasets. We describe the dependence of observable parameter distributions on the assumed mean kick velocities. As the effects of natal kicks are very complex and mutually counteracting, we suggest more detailed studies focused on the dynamics of NS are needed in anticipation of Roman and future surveys. We estimate Roman will observe approximately $11\\,000$ microlensing events - including $\\sim100$ with NS lenses - whose both photometric and astrometric signal are detectable; the event yield decreases by $38\\%$ if gap-filling low-cadence observations are not included. We make all simulated microlensing event datasets publicly available in preparation for Roman data.",

Initially focused on detecting gamma-ray bursts at high-altitude sites, LAGO has evolved into a multidisciplinary forum for astroparticle physics, space weather studies, and environmental monitoring. Its detectors operate from sea level to over 4300 meters above sea level (m a.s.l.) in diverse geomagnetic and atmospheric conditions. The ARTI-MEIGA simulation framework is a key development that models the entire cosmic-ray interaction chain, enabling site-specific simulations to be integrated into FAIR-compliant workflows. LAGO also plays a significant role in regional education and training through partnerships with ERASMUS+ projects, positioning itself as a hub for research capacity building. New contributions emerging from the collaboration include volcano muography, neutron hydrometry for precision agriculture, and space weather monitoring in the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly.

With the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), the Deeper, Wider, Faster programme (DWF) probes a unique parameter space with its deep (median of $g\\sim22.2$ AB mag), minute-cadence imaging. In this work, we present DWF's first data release which comprises high cadence photometry extracted from $\\sim$12000 images and 166 hours of telescope time. We present a novel data processing pipeline, $\\texttt{dwf-postpipe}$, developed to identify sources and extract their light curves. The accuracy of the photometry is assessed by cross-matching to public catalogues. In addition, we injected a population of synthetic GRB afterglows into a subset of the DWF DECam imaging to compare the efficiency of our pipeline with a standard difference imaging approach. Both pipelines show performance and reliably recover injected transients with peak magnitudes $g<22$ AB mag with an efficiency of $97.24^{+0.7}_{-1.0}$ percent for \\texttt{dwf-postpipe} and $96.14^{+0.9}_{-1.1}$ percent for a difference imaging approach. However, we find that $\\texttt{dwf-postpipe}$ is less likely to recover transients appearing in galaxies that are brighter or comparable in brightness to the transient itself. To demonstrate the power of the data in this release, we conduct a search for uncatalogued variable stars in a single night of DWF DECam imaging and find ten pulsating variables, two eclipsing binaries and one ZZ ceti. We also conduct a search for variable phenomena in the Chandra Deep Field South, a Rubin deep drilling field, and identify two flares from likely UV ceti type stars.",

By reanalyzing the 2022 outburst data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), we found the spin frequency and orbital parameters from the observations in 0.3-5 keV. For the 2025 outburst, we reported the detection of pulsations with the Einstein Probe (EP). Based on the $\\sim$3-year baseline between these two outbursts, we measured a significant long-term spin-down rate of $\\dot\\nu = (-5.73 \\pm 0.28) \\times 10^{-14}~{\\rm Hz~s^{-1}}$. Assuming that the quiescent spin-down is driven by magnetic dipole radiation, we inferred a spin-down luminosity of $L \\approx 1.1 \\times 10^{36}~{\\rm erg~s^{-1}}$ and a surface dipolar magnetic field of $B \\approx (7.3 - 10.4) \\times 10^8$ G. Furthermore, we conducted a deep radio pulsation search with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) during the X-ray quiescent state in 2024, resulting in a non-detection with a 7$\\sigma$ flux density upper limit of 12.3 $\\mu$Jy. This corresponds to a radio efficiency upper limit of $\\xi < 2.8 \\times 10^{-10}$, which is significantly lower than that of typical millisecond pulsars with a similar spin-down power. This profound radio pulsation faintness can be explained by two primary scenarios: either a geometric effect, wherein the pulsar's radio beam is directed away from our line of sight, or a physical suppression of the emission mechanism, potentially caused by a persistent low-level accretion flow during the X-ray quiescent state.",

We aim to understand the influence of radiative cooling on plasmoid formation within black hole accretion flows that are threaded by multi-loop magnetic field this http URL. We conducted two- and three-dimensional two-temperature general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. By varying the magnetic loop sizes and the mass accretion rate, we explored how radiative cooling alters the accretion dynamics, disk structure, and the properties of reconnection-driven plasmoid this http URL. Our results demonstrate that radiative cooling suppresses the transition to the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state by reducing magnetic flux accumulation near the horizon. It significantly modifies the disk morphology by lowering the electron temperature and compressing the disk, which leads to increased density at the equatorial plane and decreased magnetization. Within the current sheets, radiative cooling triggers layer compression and the collapse of plasmoids, shortening their lifetime and reducing their size, while the frequency of plasmoid events increases. Moreover, we observe enhanced negative energy-at-infinity density in plasmoids near the ergosphere, with its peaks corresponding to plasmoid this http URL. Radiative cooling plays a critical role in shaping both macroscopic accretion flow properties and microscopic reconnection phenomena near black holes. This suggests that radiative cooling may modulate black hole energy extraction through reconnection-driven Penrose processes, highlighting its importance in models of astrophysical black holes.",

It is a positive quantity and bounded by causality. It is defined as the rate of change of pressure with respect to the system's density. In this article, we derive a covariant equation for the sound wave and demonstrate how the wave equation is modified in the general relativistic formalism. One can then define an effective speed of sound by attenuating the usual definition of sound speed with the gravitational metric potential. The general relativistic curvature effect is observed to reduce the speed of sound when computed inside a neutron star. This effectively makes the star relatively softer (according to the equation of state). The change in the effective sound speed can be easily visualised if one redefines the non-radial modes in terms of it. The modes do not change, but the space-time curvature reduces the amplitude of the oscillation modes. The formalism is suited for studying astrophysical compact objects.",

Unsal 26 pages, 10 figures, 11 tables. Accepted for publication in ApJS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has produced the largest database of all-sky observations in gamma rays with its continuous data with high time and energy resolutions. These data contain a wealth of unidentified transient events that did not trigger the detectors for various reasons. We conducted extensive searches to identify such untriggered transient events observed with GBM in 11 years (July 2010 - June 2021). In particular, we employed four different search modes with various energy ranges (mainly below 300 keV) and time resolutions (from 8 ms to 2 s), utilizing three statistical methods (signal-to-noise ratio, Poisson, and Bayesian statistics), each with different effectiveness in identifying specific classes of transients. Moreover, we developed algorithms for known-event flagging as well as unknown-event classification for our candidate events found in the searches. In this paper, we present our search methodologies, event flagging and classification algorithms and the resulting comprehensive event catalog. The catalog contains more than a million events in total, including known events such as gamma-ray bursts, soft-gamma repeater bursts, galactic X-ray source activities, terrestrial gamma flashes, and solar flares. For each candidate event, the catalog presents the event time, detection significance, event duration, hardness ratios, known-event flagging results, and classification probabilities. Our short-transient catalog significantly expands the currently-existing list of known events and complements the GBM trigger catalog. The event database with filtering capabilities is also publicly available at this https URL, which allows users to retrieve event information based on their input queries along with the event lightcurves.",

From pulsar radio observation, it is seen that a couple of pulsars reveal new emission components at higher radio frequencies, although they show single-component emission at lower frequencies. We develop a brief outline, fostering inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of the low-frequency radio photons as a vulnerable source of scattering, susceptible to explaining the evolution of new components of some radio pulsars at higher bands. We couple the conventional curvature radiation (CR) mechanism and ICS, and suggest that the spectral convolution of the flux component individually from CR and the modulated template due to the ICS scattered component can be combined to reproduce such signatures associated with the diverse morphology of the integrated pulse profile. We reproduce the beam frequency diagram, the geometrical variation of different parameters of the emission geometry, as well as the multi-frequency evolution from theory. We have suitably tuned the input parameter space and given the combination of parameters that can tune to a particular scattered frequency in tabulated form. We conclude that ICS may be a responsible process for describing the emergence of new components in higher radio emission bands.",

We present LHAASO observations of DA~495, revealing an energy-dependent morphology, where an extended source with $r_{39}=0.19^{\\circ}\\pm0.02^{\\circ}$ is detected by WCDA (0.4-15~TeV), and a point-like source with a 95\\% upper limit of $r_{39}=0.11^{\\circ}$ is observed by KM2A ($>25~\\mathrm{TeV}$). The spectrum of the source extends beyond 100~TeV with a break or cutoff at a few tens of TeV. Our X-ray data analysis, based on Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, shows that the X-ray emission of DA~495 extends well to $\\sim 6^{\\prime}$, significantly larger than the size previously reported. The broadband spectral energy distribution across radio, X-ray and TeV $\\gamma$-ray bands is phenomenologically described by a one-zone leptonic model, yielding an average magnetic field of $\\sim$ 5 $\\mathrm{\\mu G}$, while Fermi-LAT spectral analysis indicates a likely presence of a $\\gamma$-ray pulsar within the system. A time-dependent model, in which particle transport is convection-dominated in the inner region (within $\\sim100^{\\prime\\prime}$) and diffusion-dominated in the outer region, successfully reproduces the observed radial profiles of X-ray surface brightness and spectral index, and also accounts for the TeV $\\gamma$-ray emission detected by LHAASO, suggesting that DA~495 represents an evolved PWN with ongoing particle escape that gives rise to a TeV halo component -- that is, a PWN+halo system.",

We performed a broadband timing and spectral analysis using the optical and X-ray data of eRASSU J012422.9-724248. Using the X-ray observations with eROSITA, Swift, NuSTAR and optical data from the optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) and the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO), we confirm the nature of eRASSU J012422.9-724248 as a Be/X-ray binary (BeXRB) pulsar in the Magellanic bridge. The position is coincident with that of an early-type star (OGLE ID SMC732.10.7). We detect the spin period at 341.71 s in NuSTAR data and infer a period of 63.65 days from the 15 year monitoring with OGLE, that we interpret as the orbital period of the system. A tentative CRSF at ~12.3 keV is identified in NuSTAR spectra with ~1.8-sigma. The source appears to show a persistent X-ray luminosity and an optical magnitude transition on the long timescale. We propose eRASSU J012422.9-724248 is a new member of the class of persistent BeXRBs.",

Kimura, Kohei Inayoshi High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Little Red Dots (LRDs) are enigmatic, compact, red galaxies at high redshift, $z\\sim 4$-$7$, discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope. Broad emission lines in the absence of X-ray and radio counterparts suggest that they host accreting supermassive black holes embedded in dense gaseous envelopes. This black-hole-envelope configuration facilitates efficient photohadronic interactions and neutrino production. Remarkably, their observed source number density and luminosity are compatible with the energetics of the diffuse neutrino background. We consider that relativistic jets and outflows are launched from the black hole and propagate through low-density polar funnels within envelopes, where particle acceleration and neutrino emission occur. This leads to LRDs being effectively hidden sources. Our analytic and numerical calculations show that, in an optimistic scenario, LRDs can contribute $\\sim 30\\%$ of the observed diffuse background at TeV$-$sub-PeV energies, predominantly through photomeson production. At high neutrino energies, $\\gtrsim 10^{5.5}~{\\rm GeV}$, inverse-Compton cooling of muons modifies the resulting flavor ratio, providing a distinctive diagnostic for IceCube-Gen2 and other upcoming neutrino telescopes.",

We present a pivotal insight: matter density fluctuations characterized by red spectra ($\\nu<0$), naturally arising in stratified supernova environments, can suppress such instabilities by inducing accelerated decoherence. By deriving exact analytical solutions for two-flavor evolution in red turbulent matter-where correlations grow as $t^{|\\nu|}$-we uncover a novel acceleration of coherence loss. This dynamical decoherence mechanism raises an effective energy barrier against the collective growth of flavor instabilities. Translating our master-equation results into an effective damping rate for FFC linear analysis, we find that realistic red turbulence ($\\nu \\sim -1$, fluctuation strength $\\xi_\\nu \\sim 0.1$) can elevate the FFC threshold by a factor of $\\sim 3-5$, potentially stabilizing regions that would otherwise undergo explosion-killing flavor equilibration (or vice versa). Our work provides the first analytical criterion for FFC suppression in turbulent media and identifies red turbulence as a critical, physics-grounded ingredient missing from current supernova models.",

Romani 7 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The intrabinary shocks (IBS) in spider pulsars emit non-thermal synchrotron X-rays from accelerated electrons and positrons in the shocked pulsar wind, likely energized by magnetic reconnection. The double-peaked X-ray light curves from these shocks have been well characterized in several spider systems. In this paper, we analyze Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observations of the redback pulsar J1723$-$2837 to examine the expected synchrotron polarization. Using advanced extraction methods that include spatial, temporal, and particle background weights, we constrain the polarization of the IBS. We compare different models for the magnetic field in the radiation zone and find that the best fit prefers a striped pulsar wind model over other polarized models, with maximum polarization degree of the IBS emission component $\\Pi_{\\rm IBS}=36^{+16}_{-15}\\%$, in addition to an unpolarized non-IBS component. Since this is only 2.4$\\sigma$, we cannot claim strong preference over an unpolarized model; we report a $99\\%$ confidence level upper limit on the total polarization of both IBS and non-IBS components $\\Pi_{99}<36\\%$, which is improved over the $50\\%$ limit obtained in previous work. The best-fit polarization of the IBS component is consistent with numerical simulations. Detailed tests of such models are accessible to future measurements.",

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a study of Pseudo-LRD-NOM (Pseudo little red dot with no metal lines), a highly magnified low-mass galaxy behind the lensing cluster Abell 370 at z=5.96. We classify this object as a pseudo-LRD because its red rest-frame optical colour is mainly driven by a prominent Halpha line (with EW0 >~ 800 Angstroms) present in its JWST NIRSpec spectrum. Halpha is dominated by a narrow component and also has a minor broad component indicative of an active black hole with M_BH = 2.9x10^6 Msun. A narrow Hbeta emission line is also detected (with S/N = 8), producing a Balmer decrement (narrow) Halpha/Hbeta = 11. The rest-frame UV spectral slope is beta_UVspec = -1.2. All these features can be ascribed to high dust attenuation. However, no [OIII]5007 or any other metal lines are detected in the spectrum, so [OIII]5007/Hbeta < 0.25, at odds with a simple dust-attenuation explanation. Accounting for all the spectral properties requires the model of a starburst with moderate colour excess E(B-V)=0.18-0.45, high gas density (n_H >~ 10^6 cm^{-3}) and extremely low gas/stellar metallicities (Z = 0.01-0.1 Zsun). The demagnified stellar mass is 1.62^{+1.54}_{-0.79} x10^7 Msun and the stellar-mass surface density is Sigma* = 418^{+725}_{-310} Msun/pc^2, similar to that of massive/nuclear star clusters. Pseudo-LRD-NOM provides evidence of massive black-hole growth occurring in a high-density, dusty starburst which is at the early stages of its chemical enrichment, and is likely a precursor to a real LRD.",

Accepted for publication on A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) In the last few years, a few supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have shown short-term (of the order of hours) X-ray variability. Given the limited size of the sample, every new addition to this class of SMBHs can bring invaluable information. Within the context of an automated search for X-ray sources showing flux variability in the \\textit{Chandra} archive, we identified peculiar variability patterns in 2MASX J12571076+2724177 (J1257), a SMBH in the Coma cluster, during observations performed in 2020. We investigated the long-term evolution of the flux, together with the evolution of the spectral parameters throughout the \\textit{Chandra} and \\textit{XMM-Newton} observations, which cover a time span of approximately 20 years. We found that J1257 has repeatedly shown peculiar variability over the last 20 years, on typical timescales of $\\simeq20-30$ ks. From our spectral analysis, we found hints of a softer-when-brighter behaviour and of two well-separated flux states. We suggest that J1257 might represent a new addition to the ever-growing size of relatively low mass SMBHs ($M\\simeq10^6-10^7\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$) showing extreme, possibly quasi-periodic X-ray variability on short time scales. The available dataset does not allow for a definitive classification of the nature of the variability. However, given the observed properties, it could either represent a quasi-periodic oscillation at particularly low frequency or be associated with quasi-periodic eruptions in an AGN with peculiar spectral properties.",

To solve the inverse problem of inferring the progenitor properties of binaries that evolve into SS$\\,$433-like systems, we use an iterative, simulation-based calibration framework that combines Bayesian inference with the isolated binary-evolution code COSMIC. Using six measured properties of SS$\\,$433 and the dynamic nested sampler $\\texttt{dynesty}$, we explore a ten-dimensional space of possible progenitor masses, orbits, mass-transfer histories, and natal-kick velocities. This approach identifies the regions of parameter space most consistent with SS$\\,$433 and allows us to iteratively refine the resulting progenitor distributions. We find 90% confidence intervals for the progenitor initial primary mass of (8, 11) M$_\\odot$, secondary mass of (32, 40) M$_\\odot$, orbital period of (136, 2259) days, eccentricity of (0.26, 0.6), common-envelope efficiency of (0.44, 0.76), accreted fraction during stable mass transfer of (0.22, 0.6), and black-hole natal-kick magnitude of (5, 68) km/s. These results show that direct probabilistic inference of X-ray binary progenitors can yield new constraints on the formation of extreme accretion systems like SS$\\,$433, which has important implications for theoretical expectations of the population of SS$\\,$433-like systems in the Galaxy and their connection with cosmic ray observations.",

Using realistic luminosity-dependent density evolution (LDDE) functions derived from observed gamma-ray luminosity functions for FSRQs and BL Lacs, we calculate the redshift evolution of the cosmic ray source population through integrated luminosity functions. The diffuse UHECRs flux from these sources is modelled by propagating nuclei through extragalactic space, including energy losses from interactions with cosmic photon backgrounds. The resulting UHECRs spectra are compared with observational data from the Pierre Auger Observatory and the Telescope Array, with fluxes normalised at reference energies. We also construct illustrative full skymaps of the integral UHECRs flux from $10$ EeV to $100$ EeV using the \\textsc{HEALPix} framework, assuming a uniform distribution of synthetic sources and including energy-dependent magnetic diffusion. The regions of higher flux in the maps arise naturally from propagation effects and the limited UHECRs horizon. Our results indicate that LDDE-modelled AGNs could contribute significantly to the observed diffuse UHECRs flux and provide constraints on their role as potential sources.",

Despite the extraordinary brightness, GECAM-C has accurately measured both the bright prompt emission and flare emission of GRB 221009A without instrumental effects, offering a good opportunity to study the relation between them. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of flare emission of GRB 221009A, which is composed of a series of flares. Among them, we identify an exceptionally bright flare with a record-breaking isotropic energy $E_{\\rm iso} = 1.82 \\times 10^{53}$ erg of GRB flares. It exhibits the highest peak energy ever detected in GRB flares, $E_{\\rm peak} \\sim 300$ keV, making it a genuine gamma-ray flare. It also shows rapid rise and decay timescales, significantly shorter than those of typical X-ray flares observed in soft X-ray or optical band, but comparable to those observed in prompt emissions. Despite these exceptional properties, the flare shares several common properties with typical GRB flares. We note that this is the first observation of a GRB flare in the keV-MeV band with sufficiently high temporal resolution and high statistics, which bridges the last gap between prompt emission and flare.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We conduct a population synthesis study using the binary population synthesis code compas to explore the formation of circumbinary disks (CBDs) following the common envelope evolution (CEE) phase of a giant star and a neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH). We focus on massive binary systems that evolve into double compact object (DCO) binaries after the exposed core of the giant collapses to form a second NS or BH. A CBD around the binary system of the giant's core and the compact object alters the orbital evolution of the binary. We parameterize the conditions for CBD formation in post-CEE binaries and present characteristics of DCO progenitors that are likely or unlikely to form CBDs. We find that CBD formation is most common in BH-BH binaries and NS-NS binaries that are expected to merge within Hubble time. Furthermore, we find that the interaction of the CBD with the core - NS/BH system at the termination of the CEE reduces the expected rate of DCO mergers, regardless of whether these binaries tighten or expand due to this interaction. If the binary system loses angular momentum to the CBD, it may produce a luminous transient due to a merger between the NS/BH and the core of the giant rather than gravitational wave sources. Thus, accounting for post-CEE CBD formation and its interaction with the binary system in population synthesis studies is significant for obtaining reliable predictions of the gravitational wave event rates expected by current detectors.",

Submitted to ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic observations of the nearby Type II supernova SN\\,2024ggi from 250 and 420 days after the explosion. Comparing the evolution of the [\\ion{O}{1}] at 6300, 6363 \\textÅ doublet normalized to the continuum with spectral models from the literature, we estimate a progenitor star zero-age main-sequence mass ($M_{\\mathrm{ZAMS}}$) of $\\approx 14$ M$_\\odot$. This value is consistent with $M_{\\mathrm{ZAMS}}$ reported in the literature from independent methodologies. The nebular spectra are used to study the structure of the inner ejecta. The broad H$\\alpha$ line has a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of $\\simeq 3900$ km s$^{-1}$, with small deviations from a symmetric Gaussian profile centred at zero velocity, and the [\\ion{O}{1}] doublet is blue-shifted by $\\approx -940$ km s$^{-1}$. In the NIR, the nebular spectra reveal double-peaked emission features of \\ion{Mg}{1} and [\\ion{Fe}{2}] lines, suggesting a bipolar distribution of intermediate mass and iron peak elements in the line-of-sight. Such a double-peaked feature in these NIR lines has not been previously reported. No corresponding asymmetries are observed in the hydrogen lines, suggesting that the asymmetry is mostly confined to intermediate mass and iron peak elements in the innermost core of the supernova ejecta. Additionally, we detect first-overtone carbon monoxide (CO) emission at $2.3$ $\\mu$m from 250 to 319 days in the NIR.",

One of the most profound consequences of that is the change in relationship between the frequency and the wave number of electromagnetic waves propagating in plasma in the presence of such magnetic fields when compared to the case without these fields. Furthermore, magnetic fields alter electromagnetic wave interaction with relativistic plasma waves, resulting in different outcomes for particle and radiation generation. For a relativistic plasma wave-based photon acceleration this leads to an increased frequency gain, and, thus, potentially to higher efficiency. The influence of a magnetic field leads to quantitative and qualitative change in the properties of photon acceleration, amplifying the increase in the electromagnetic wave frequency.",

Fraser-McKelvie, Jiayi Sun, Adam Watts 25 pages, 12 figures, Accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present high-resolution Very Large Array (VLA) continuum observations at S-band ($3$ GHz, $560$ pc scale) and X-band ($10$ GHz, $200$ pc scale) of the ram-pressure-stripped Virgo galaxy NGC 4522, to investigate the characteristics of its radio continuum, spectral index, and magnetic field under the influence of the intracluster medium (ICM). The total radio continuum shows an asymmetry that extends northwest, mirroring the HI gas distribution, but showing distinct features in the extraplanar regions. The spectral index steepens systematically from $\\alpha\\sim-0.6$ in the main disk to $\\alpha\\sim-1.1$ in the outer disk. We find that the spectral index behavior of the outer disk is mainly due to an ICM shock that can re-accelerate electrons and a significant reduction of thermal emission. Intriguingly, extraplanar clouds exhibit exceptionally flat spectral indices ($\\alpha\\sim-0.2$ to $0$), resulting from a combination of significantly enhanced thermal emission and pronounced spectral aging of the non-thermal component. Although some of these regions correlate with H$\\alpha$, others do not. We propose that the mixing between the ICM and interstellar medium (ISM) is an alternative mechanism that enhances thermal emission independently of star formation. Polarized continuum emissions are highly asymmetric, preferentially distributed along the ICM wind side, and the polarization fraction increases radially outward from the galactic midplane, indicating that the polarized emission is strongly influenced by the ICM wind. Our results show how and where the ICM substantially affects the ISM, and also demonstrate that high-frequency observations are crucial for analyzing the radio continuum of ram pressure stripping galaxies.",

They are generally photon energy converters, absorbing short wavelength radiation and emitting long wavelength radiation. Sixty years ago in 1965, thermal emission from dust grains in the interstellar medium was discovered. This tutorial is a summary of the physics of thermal dust continuum emission and how to use observations of the intensity and flux density of dusty objects to calculate physical properties such as mass, column density, luminosity, dust temperature, and dust opacity spectral index. Equations are derived, when feasible, from first principles with all limits and assumptions explicitly stated. Properties of dust opacities appropriate for different astrophysical environments (e.g. diffuse ISM, dense cores, protoplanetary disks) are discussed and tabulated for the wavelengths of past, current, and future bolometer cameras. Corrections for observations at high redshift as well as the effects of telescope measurement limitations are derived. We also update the calculation of the mean molecular weight in different ISM environments and find that it is 1.404 per H atom, 2.809 per H2 molecule, and 2.351 per gas particle assuming protosolar metallicity and the latest values of the ISM gas phase abundances of metals.",

The HI is resolved at the highest redshift with the 7.5 arcsec beam of CHILES and 43 kpc linear scale, with all four galaxies having extended HI. Three are massive galaxies (Mstellar > 3 e10 Mo), with HI masses of 1.6 - 6.7 e10 Mo, and active star formation (3 - 30 Mo/yr). The morphology and kinematics of the galaxies vary from regular to disturbed, including an asymmetric HI disk surrounding the fourth smaller galaxy (Mstellar ~ e9 Mo). CO(1-0) observations of the sample, obtained with the LMT, confirm the redshifts of three of the four galaxies and we derive H2 masses of 0.4 - 5.2 e10 Mo. JWST imaging with four combined NIRCam filters reveals disturbed stellar components with compact knots in two of the galaxies. We combine our new higher-redshift galaxies with previously published observations to conduct a more complete study of HI and H2 evolution in the redshift range 0 - 0.5. With our HI flux-limited observations compared to similar lower redshift galaxies with high stellar mass (Mstellar > e10 Mo), the results show the mean H2/HI ratio at the highest redshift is 10.3 +- 3.4 larger than the mean H2/HI ratio in the local Universe.",

Large-scale imaging surveys present unprecedented opportunities to expand the sample of cluster lenses. In this study, we adopt a deep learning-based approach to identify cluster lenses from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, utilizing the catalog of galaxy cluster candidates identified by Zou et al. (2021). Our lens-finder employs a ResNet-18 architecture, trained with mock images of cluster lenses as positives and observational images of cluster scale non-lenses as negatives. We do an iterative operation to increase the completeness of our work, namely adding the found true positive samples back to the training set and training again for several times. Human inspection is conducted to further refine the candidates, categorizing them into grades (A, B, C) according to the significance of the strongly lensed arcs. Reviewing all 540,432 objects in Zou's catalog, we discover 485 high-confidence cluster lens candidates with a cluster $M_{500}$ range of $10^{13.67\\sim14.97}M_{\\odot}$ and a Brightest Central Galaxy (BCG) redshift range of $0.04\\sim0.89$. After excluding the lens candidates listed in previous studies, we identify 247 newly discovered cluster lens candidates, including 16 grade A, 90 grade B, and 141 grade C. This catalog of cluster lens candidates is publicly available online, and follow-up observations are encouraged to confirm and conduct thorough investigations of these systems.",

At $z\\gtrsim 3.5$, star-forming galaxies occupy a common locus, indicating that ISM ionizing conditions at fixed gas-phase metallicity do not evolve strongly at these early cosmic times. There is a connection between ISM ionizing conditions and the chemical abundance patterns (i.e., $\\alpha$/Fe) in massive stars providing the ionizing radiation field. Therefore, the lack of evolution in ISM ionizing conditions at $z\\gtrsim 3.5$, followed by evolution towards a softer ionizing spectrum at fixed nebular metallicity as cosmic time proceeds to $z\\sim 2$ and lower redshift mirrors the chemical abundance patterns in Milky Way stars as a function of iron abundance.

The magnetic field orientations across multiple scales suggests that the magnetic field dominates at the cloud scale, whereas gravity likely governs the structures at the core (0.01$-$0.1 pc) and condensation ($\\le$ 0.01 pc) scales. Furthermore, the study on the angular difference between the orientations of the local gravity gradient and the magnetic field suggests that the magnetic field predominantly governs the dynamics in the diffuse regions, while gravity and star formation feedback become increasingly significant within the dense regions.

The broad component of H$\\alpha$ has a FWHM of $2721 \\pm 200\\ {\\rm km\\ s^{-1}}$, corresponding to a black hole mass of $M_{\\rm BH}=2.90^{+2.35}_{-1.28}\\times 10^7 M_\\odot$ and a black hole-to-stellar mass ratio of $\\log (M_{\\rm BH}/M_{\\rm stellar}) = -1.58^{+0.45}_{-0.34}$. The Balmer decrement ($\\rm H\\alpha/H\\beta$) yields a dust attenuation of $\\rm A_V \\approx 1.15 \\pm 0.23$, indicating that this system is less dust-rich than some \"little red dots\". Furthermore, we perform SED fitting using both stellar and AGN models. The results show that the UV and optical wavelengths are dominated by star-forming regions, while the AGN component contributes primarily at longer wavelengths. This work provides new insights into the interplay between star formation, neutral gas, and potential AGN activity in galaxies during the EoR.",

Williams 17 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication at A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Nearby galaxies exhibit a variety of structures, including central rings, similar to the MW Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). These rings are common in barred galaxies and can be gas-rich and highly star-forming. We aim to study molecular gas content and star formation rate of central rings within nearby galaxies and link them to global galaxy properties (e.g. bar morphology). We utilize $1\\,$'' resolution CO(2-1) PHANGS-ALMA observations, visually identify 20 central rings and determine their properties. For $14$ rings, SFR surface density maps are available. We derive ring geometry, integrated molecular gas masses, SFRs, depletion times, and compare them to host galaxy and bar properties. Molecular gas is a good tracer for central rings: Previous studies used ionized gas and dust tracers to identify central rings in galaxies of similar morphological types as this study. In comparison, we find similar fractions of galaxies hosting central rings and similar radii distributions. The gaseous central rings have typical radii of $400_{-150}^{+250}\\,$pc, molecular gas masses of $\\log(M_\\text{mol}/M_\\odot){\\sim}8.1_{-0.23}^{+0.17}$, and SFRs of $0.21_{-0.16}^{+0.15}\\,M_\\odot/\\text{yr}$, thus contributing $5.6_{-2.1}^{+4.5}\\,\\%$ and $13_{-5}^{+10}\\,\\%$ to their host galaxies' molecular gas mass and SFR. The MW CMZ sits at the lower end of the radius, molecular gas mass, and SFR distribution, but it has a similar molecular gas mass and SFR fraction, and depletion time. Longer bars contain more massive molecular central rings, but we find no correlation between bar strength and the ring's molecular gas content. Although absolute central ring properties likely depend on host galaxy properties, the similarities between the MW CMZ and PHANGS central rings in relative parameters suggest that the processes of gas inflow and star formation are similar for central rings across nearby galaxies.",

Spectral Energy Distributions, Star Formation Histories, and the Infrared-Radio Correlation of the 850 $μ$m-selected SMGs Xin Zeng, Yiping Ao, Ken Mawatari, Hideki Umehata Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We analyze the spectral energy distributions (SEDs), star formation histories (SFHs), and infrared-radio correlation (IRRC) of 221 850 $\\mu$m-selected submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the SSA22 deep field. The median mass-weighted age is 567 Myr. Most galaxies in our sample began forming $\\sim$ 1.68 Gyr after the Big Bang, entered the `SMG phase' after $\\sim$ 1 Gyr of evolution -- when they are predominantly observed -- and largely transitioned out of the `SMG phase' to become quiescent within an additional $\\sim$ 0.2 Gyr. A subset of massive galaxies shows rapid early assembly with high star formation efficiencies ($\\sim$0.2-0.8). The majority of SMGs reside at the high-mass end of the star-forming main sequence, with a characteristic stellar mass of $M_{star} \\sim 10^{11}$ M$_\\odot$, above which galaxies are predominantly either on the main sequence or already quenched. We observe a downsizing trend: more massive galaxies tend to ``mature\" earlier, completing their major episodes of star formation at higher redshifts compared to lower-mass systems. Our sample contributes $\\sim$ 21% (28%) to the cosmic star formation rate density (stellar mass density), including the overdensity, with its relative contribution peaking at 50-60% in the redshift range $z=2.5-3.5$. We suggest that 850 $\\mu$m surveys may miss a population of faint, warm galaxies at $z \\geq 1$-2. The median infrared-radio correlation parameter $q_{IR}$ is 2.37, evolving as $(1+z)^{-0.11}$, likely due to AGN contributions at high redshift and intrinsic differences between low- and high-redshift populations.",

They are direct stellar probes to identify the galaxy progenitors of haloes and the intracluster light. Even with new facilities, reaching higher angular resolution and sensitivity, xPNe are the only stellar tracers that can be directly and singularly detected and characterised out to 100 Mpc distance, making them crucial for tracing halo and intracluster light assembly. New wide-field spectroscopic instruments at 10+meter-class telescopes will allow the unprecedented characterisation of xPN populations from galaxy centres to their diffuse outskirts. Panoramic integral-field spectroscopy will enable the simultaneous study of xPN and stellar population properties, establishing their use as age- and metallicity-tracers while also improving post-AGB stellar evolution models.",

R., Cortesi A., Telles E., Kanaan A., Ribeiro T., Schoenell W Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics 18 pages, 28 figures, 4 tables Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) In the context of pre-processing -- a scenario in which galaxies quench their star formation within substructures before falling into clusters -- we investigate the impact of environment on the physical and morphological properties of galaxies in Compact Groups (CGs), focusing specifically on a sample of Star-Forming Compact Groups (SFCGs). Our aim is to characterize the physical and morphological properties of galaxies in SFCGs, analogues of the Blue Infalling Group, and to understand how the environment influences their evolution. We use photometric techniques to derive stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs). Morphological parameters are extracted from DECaLS images, obtaining parametric properties such as the Sérsic index ($n$) and effective radius ($R_{\\mathrm{e}}$) using GALFITM, as well as non-parametric indices -- including the Gini coefficient, $M_{20}$, and asymmetry -- from the same data. These indicators allow us to classify galaxies into E/S0/Sa, Sb/Sc/Ir, and merger types. All measurements are compared to a control sample of field galaxies to assess environmental effects. We find no significant differences in $n$ and $R_{\\mathrm{e}}$ between SFCG and field galaxies, in contrast to results reported for other CG samples. However, SFCG galaxies exhibit higher specific star formation rates (sSFRs) than their field counterparts. Approximately $16\\%$ of SFCG galaxies show merger features and elevated asymmetry. These mergers also present enhanced SFRs compared to both other SFCG types and the field population. We propose that SFCGs represent an earlier evolutionary phase of CGs, supported by their lower velocity dispersions and moderate crossing times, in addition to the observed SFR enhancement and the absence of pronounced morphological transformation. Galaxy mergers in this phase appear to enhance, rather than suppress, star formation.",

Smith 23 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables, accepted at ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We apply the angular two-point correlation function (TPCF) to the spatial distribution of young star clusters (YSCs) in four nearby star forming galaxies (NGC 628, NGC 4449, M51, and M83) in order to investigate their underlying hierarchical structuring. Using newly constructed catalogs of YSCs in the emerging phase (eYSCs), identified in the infrared with JWST, and optical YSCs detected in archival HST data, we compute TPCFs for various cluster samples and age bins across the four galaxies as part of the FEAST (Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star ClusTers) program. We find clear evidence of hierarchical structuring, especially in eYSCs and YSCs with ages < 10 Myr (referred to as oYSCs), which show similar TPCFs within each galaxy. NGC 628 exhibits a clear distinction between the TPCFs of eYSCs and oYSCs, implying a shorter randomization timescale. In contrast, clusters aged 10 to 300 Myr exhibit progressively more random spatial distributions, becoming effectively random after $\\sim$ 100 Myr, consistent with earlier studies. The two-dimensional fractal index $D_2$ of the YSCs underlying distribution is calculated from model fits to TPCFs. Our values of $D_2$ derived from the youngest YSC populations align better with the expected value of $D_2 \\sim $1.3 for a universal star formation process compared to previous findings.",

Stanton 12 pages, 7 figures, submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present JWST/NIRSpec PRISM observations of a robust galaxy candidate at $z\\simeq14$, selected from pure-parallel NIRCam imaging; PAN-z14-1. The NIRSpec spectrum allows confirmation of this source at $z_{\\rm spec}=13.53^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$ through modeling of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ break. PAN-z14-1 is the fourth most distant galaxy known to date and is extremely luminous ($M_{\\rm UV}=-20.6\\pm0.2$), with a blue UV-continuum slope ($\\beta=-2.26\\pm0.08$) and a large physical size ($r_{\\rm c}=233\\pm10\\, \\rm pc$). We fail to detect any rest-frame UV emission lines at $\\geq 2\\sigma$ significance, with upper limits sufficiently constraining to exclude the possibility of strong line emission. In terms of its physical properties, PAN-z14-1 is remarkably similar to the previously confirmed $z_{\\rm spec}=14.18$ galaxy GS-z14-0. The lack of strong emission lines and large physical size is consistent with an emerging picture of two potentially distinct galaxy populations at $z>10$, distinguished by star-formation rate surface density. In this scenario, PAN-z14-1 is a second example of a ``normal'', extended, luminous, star-forming galaxy at $z \\simeq 14$, and differs markedly from the other class of extremely compact galaxies with strong emission lines recently uncovered at extreme redshifts with JWST. These results highlight the importance of further spectroscopic confirmation of $z>10$ galaxy candidates in order to fully understand the diversity of properties displayed by the first galaxies.",

Exploiting this, we compare asteroseismic masses of red giants with the same [C/N] and but different evolutionary states. We find bulk differences between stars at the beginning of the red giant branch and in the subsequent evolutionary phase, the red clump, providing a direct constraint on the strength of net RGB mass loss in field stars. We find that net mass loss decreases with metallicity and mass, matching recent studies for field giants, but contradicting expectations from the widely used Reimers' mass loss formula. We propose a mass- and metallicity-dependent Reimers' $\\eta$ calibration that reproduces the empirical trends that we see. In addition, we identify 207 stars (3.33% of our sample) that are clear outliers from their population in these birth mass bins, which we believe are likely candidates for mass transfer events. These stars do not show any obvious discrepancies in abundances or binary properties from their counterparts. This population should be accounted for in Galactic archaeological studies.

For the jet morphology, we measure the PA at multiple epochs by applying the Larson-Sekanina Rotational Gradient filter to Hubble Space Telescope images between November 20, 2025 and December 27, 2025, and model the phase-folded PA curve with weighted least-squares Fourier series up to two harmonics while scanning trial periods P to identify minima in \\c{hi}2(P). For the photometry, we adopt the best-fit period from an independent 30-minute binned analysis (from a 0.25 meter telescope MPC L92) based on a refined \\c{hi}2(P) profile for a sinusoidal model with nightly offsets. We find that the jet-PA modulation gives a period Pjet = 7.20 +/-0.05 h (adopting a conservative uncertainty dominated by sparse sampling and systematics), while the photometry yields Pphot = 7.136+/-0.001 h (formal 1{\\sigma} uncertainty). Although the periods differ slightly, the offset is plausibly attributable to non-Gaussian systematics and aliasing. The combined data supports a post-perihelion rotation period of 7.1 h associated with precession of the jet structure around the rotation axis by 20°. The rotation axis is aligned with the sunward direction to within 20°",

(2016, 2019) survey. Three different morphologies are observed: elongated or double-peak string-like structure (6 out of 23 cases), a collection of distinct continuum peaks (4 out of 23 cases), and single compact sources (13 out of 23 cases). The majority of H$_2$O maser spots detected are within a sky-projected distance of $\\sim5,000$ au from the radio continuum peaks and tend to be well aligned and distributed in an elongated structure when more than three spots are observed. We generally recover less emission than Rosero et al. (2016, 2019), which together with the fact that more than half of the jet candidates in our survey appear mostly compact, suggest core/halo shock structures even on small scales. We also detected proper motion in 10 cases and measured an average projected velocity of approximately 120 km s$^{-1}$. Radio brightness variability is detected in at least two cases, possibly due to weak accretion bursts. This work, together with our previous molecular jet study, provides further evidence that support the main source of ionization in the studied sources is shocks, yet collimation is only observed in 4 cases. We conclude that the available data supports the thermal jet classification of 7 sources, and the ionized jet interpretation is further supported in 16 sources.",

The planetary signal was captured by the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) and the DECam Rogue Earths and Mars Survey (DREAMS). DREAMS's minute-cadence observations break the central/resonant degeneracy in the binary-lens models. The color of the faint source star ($I=22$) is measured from the DREAMS's $r - z$ color. The planetary system has a planet-host mass ratio of $q \\sim 5 \\times 10^{-4}$. A Bayesian analysis yields a host-star mass of $\\sim 0.3\\,M_\\odot$, a planetary mass of $\\sim 40\\,M_{\\oplus}$, a projected planet-host separation of $\\sim 1.6~\\mathrm{au}$, and a lens distance of $\\sim 7.5~\\mathrm{kpc}$. Based on the photometric precision achieved by DREAMS for this event, we simulate free-floating planet (FFP) detections and find that DREAMS is sensitive to Mars-mass FFPs in the Galactic bulge and Moon-mass FFPs in the Galactic disk.",

Shafter, Kamil Hornoch 26 pages, 11 figures, 8 tables; accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Supplements Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The peak luminosities and rates of decline for a large sample of novae recently published by Clark et al. have been analyzed using the Yaron et al. nova models to estimate fundamental properties of the M31 nova population. The apparent white dwarf (WD) mass distribution is approximately Gaussian with a mean $\\langle M_\\mathrm{WD} \\rangle = 1.16\\pm0.14~M_{\\odot}$. When corrected for recurrence-time bias, the mean drops to $\\langle M_\\mathrm{WD} \\rangle = 1.07~M_\\odot$. The average WD mass of the M31 nova sample is found to be remarkably similar to that found by Shara et al. in their study of 82 Galactic novae, but $\\sim0.15~M_\\odot$ more massive than the mean recently determined by Schaefer in his comprehensive study of more than 300 systems. As expected, the average WD mass for the recurrent novae included in the M31 sample, $\\langle M_\\mathrm{WD} \\rangle = 1.33\\pm0.08~M_{\\odot}$, is significantly higher than that for novae generally. Other parameters of interest, such as the accretion rate, velocity of the ejecta, and the predicted recurrence time, are characterized by skewed distributions with large spreads about means of $\\langle \\log \\dot M ~(M_\\odot~\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}) \\rangle \\simeq -9.27$, $\\langle V_\\mathrm{max} \\rangle \\simeq 1690~\\mathrm{km~s}^{-1}$, and $\\langle \\log P_\\mathrm{rec}~\\mathrm{(yr)} \\rangle \\simeq 4.39$, respectively. The role of hibernation in affecting the $\\dot M$ and $P_\\mathrm{rec}$ distributions is briefly discussed. Finally, the nova properties were studied as a function of apparent position (isophotal radius) in M31, with the preponderance of evidence failing to establish any clear dependence on stellar population.",

Yang Accepted for publication by Astronomy & Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revolutionizing our understanding of the Universe by unveiling faint, near-infrared dropouts previously beyond our reach, ranging from exceptionally dusty sources to galaxies up to redshift $z \\sim 14$. In this paper, we identify F200W-dropout objects in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey which are absent from existing catalogs. Our selection method can effectively identify obscured low-mass ($\\log \\text{M}_* \\leq 9$) objects at $z \\leq 6$, massive dust-rich sources up to $z \\sim 12$, and ultra-high-redshift ($z > 15$) candidates. Primarily relying on NIRCam photometry from the latest CEERS data release and supplementing with Mid-Infrared/(sub-)mm data when available, our analysis pipeline combines multiple SED-fitting codes, star formation histories, and CosMix - a novel tool for astronomical stacking. Our work highlights three $2<z<3$ dusty dwarf galaxies which have larger masses compared to the typical dusty dwarfs previously identified in CEERS. Additionally, we reveal five faint sources with significant probability of lying above $z>15$, with best-fit masses compatible with $\\Lambda$CDM and a standard baryons-to-star conversion efficiency. Their bi-modal redshift probability distributions suggest they could also be $z<1.5$ dwarf galaxies with extreme dust extinction. We also identify a strong line emitter galaxy at $z \\sim 5$ mimicking the near-infrared emission of a $z \\sim 13$ galaxy. Our sample holds promising candidates for future follow-ups. Confirming ultra high-redshift galaxies or lower-z dusty dwarfs will offer valuable insights into early galaxy formation, evolution with their central black holes and the nature of dark matter, and/or cosmic dust production mechanisms in low-mass galaxies, and will help us to understand degeneracies and contamination in high-z object searches.",

      "abstract": "Amaryllis: a digital twin of the earliest galaxies in the Universe Mahsa Kohandel, Andrea Pallottini, Andrea Ferrara 11 pages, 5 figures, Published in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Synergies between JWST and ALMA are unveiling a population of bright, super-early ($z>10$) galaxies, including systems like GS-z14-0 ($z=14.2$) and GHZ2 ($z=12.3$) with extreme FIR line ratios ([OIII] 88$\\,$um / [CII] 158$\\,$um $>3$) that challenge galaxy formation models. To address this, we identify a synthetic analog of these sources, \"Amaryllis\", within the SERRA zoom-in simulations, and track its evolution from $z=16$ to $z=7$. During this period, Amaryllis grows from $\\log(M_\\star/M_{\\odot}) \\sim 7.4$ to $10.3$, linking super-early progenitors to the massive galaxy population at the end of reionization. At $z \\sim 11.3$, Amaryllis closely matches the observed properties of GS-z14-0, including $M_\\star$, SFR, and the luminosity of FIR ([OIII] 88$\\,$um) and UV (e.g. CIII]$\\,1908$) lines. We find that high [OIII]/[CII] ratios appear during short, merger-driven starburst episodes, when low metallicity ($Z \\sim 0.1\\,Z_{\\odot}$) and high ionization conditions ($U_{\\mathrm{ion}} \\sim 0.3$) push the ISM far from equilibrium. These extreme FIR line ratios are thus transient and linked to major mergers that ignite strong ionized gas outflows. Strikingly, despite this dynamical activity, Amaryllis develops a rotation-supported gaseous disk ($V/\\sigma \\sim 4$-6) by $z \\sim 11$, while stars remain dispersion-dominated. This coexistence of ordered gas rotation and merger-driven disturbances occurs within a massive yet typical $\\Lambda$CDM halo, enabling disk formation even at cosmic dawn.",

These data provide an unprecedented view of the galaxy's interstellar medium (ISM) and allow us to resolve ionised nebulae at a spatial scale of $\\approx$5 pc. We identified and catalogued 131 HII regions, down to H\\alpha luminosities of $\\approx 5\\times$10$^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$, one order of magnitude fainter than previous surveys on nearby galaxies beyond the Local Group, and we compared these regions with the spatial distribution of ionising stars and embedded star clusters. For each region, we extracted the corresponding integrated optical spectra and measured the intensity of key optical emission lines (H\\beta, [OIII], [NII], H\\alpha, [SII], [SIII]), other weaker optical lines when detectable, and Paschen lines to characterise the physical properties of the ioinised gas, such as density, dust attenuation, and metallicity. Our spatially resolved line ratio and flux maps reveal a remarkable diversity in ionisation properties, from dust-obscured regions hosting young stellar objects to highly ionised bubbles exhibiting high [OIII]/H\\beta ratios. Our data reveal a diversity of ionisation fronts, ranging from well-defined to partial to absent. The radial profiles we obtained indicate the presence of both optically thin (density-bounded) HII regions permitting the escape of ionising photons and fully ionised, optically thick (ionisation-bounded) HII regions. The richness of this MUSE mosaic offers an unprecedented view of the ionised ISM at $\\approx$5 pc resolution, providing direct insight into how stellar feedback shapes its environment.",

Accepted for publication in Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We estimate key parameters for the Galactic globular clusters NGC1904 and NGC4372 and update the parameters for NGC288, NGC362, NGC5904, NGC6205, and NGC6218, which were analysed in our previous papers. We fit various colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of the clusters using isochrones from the DSED and BaSTI. The CMDs are constructed from data sets provided by the HST, Gaia, SMSS, a large compilation of Stetson, and other sources, using multiple filters for each cluster. Our cross-identification of almost all the data sets with those from Gaia or HST allows us to use their astrometry to precisely select cluster members in all the data sets. We obtain the following estimates for NGC288, NGC362, NGC1904, NGC4372, NGC5904, NGC6205 and NGC6218, respectively: metallicities [Fe/H]$=-1.28$, $-1.26$, $-1.64$, $-2.28$, $-1.33$, $-1.56$, and $-1.27$ dex; ages $12.94$, $10.33$, $13.16$, $12.81$, $11.53$, $12.75$, and $13.03$ Gyr; distances $8.83$, $9.00$, $12.66$, $5.17$, $7.24$, $7.39$, and $4.92$ kpc; reddenings $E(B-V)=0.022$, $0.029$, $0.031$, $0.545$, $0.045$, $0.024$, and $0.210$ mag; extinctions $Av=0.09$, $0.09$, $0.11$, $1.58$, $0.13$, $0.09$, and $0.67$ mag; and extinction-to-reddening ratio $Rv=3.9$, $3.0$, $3.8$, $2.9$, $2.9$, $3.6$, and $3.2$. We confirm that the differences in horizontal branch morphology among the 16 Galactic globular clusters analysed in our studies can be explained by variations in their metallicity, age, mass-loss efficiency, and the loss of low-mass members during cluster evolution. Accordingly, most clusters indicate a relatively high mass-loss efficiency, consistent with the Reimers mass-loss law with $\\eta>0.3$.",

Whitworth 14 pages, 10 figures, submitted to MNRAS Comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Cloud-cloud collisions are expected to trigger star formation by compressing gas into dense, gravitationally unstable regions. However, the role of magnetic fields in this process is unclear. We use SPH to model head-on collisions between two uniform density clouds, each with mass $500 \\,$M$_{\\odot}$, initial radius 2 pc, and embedded in a uniform magnetic field parallel to the collision velocity. As in the nonmagnetic case, the resulting shock-compressed layer fragments into a network of filaments. If the collision is sufficiently slow, the filaments are dragged into radial orientations by non-homologous gravitational contraction, resulting in a $\\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphology, which spawns a centrally concentrated monolithic cluster with a broad mass function shaped by competitive accretion and dynamical ejections. If the collision is faster, a $\\textit{Spiders Web}$ of intersecting filaments forms, and star-systems condense out in small subclusters, often at the filament intersections; due to their smaller mass reservoirs, and the lower probability of dynamical ejection, the mass function of star-systems formed in these subclusters is narrower. Magnetic fields affect this dichotomy quantitatively by delaying collapse and fragmentation. As a result, the velocity threshold separating $\\textit{Hub Filament}$ and $\\textit{Spiders Web}$ morphologies is shifted upward in magnetised runs, thereby enlarging the parameter space in which $\\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphologies form, and enhancing the likelihood of producing centrally concentrated clusters. Consequently, magnetic fields regulate both the morphology and timing of star formation in cloud-cloud collisions: they broaden filaments, delay the onset of star formation, and promote the formation of $\\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphologies, monolithic clusters and high-mass star-systems.",

Physical Origin Po-Sheng Ou, Ke-Jung Chen 18 pages, 18 figures, Accepted for publication in ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) This study investigates the physical origin of the critical metallicity required for the formation of cool supergiants, as revealed by stellar evolution models. Using grids of stellar models, we show that the terminal-age main-sequence (TAMS) radius, $R_{\\rm TAMS}$, defines a threshold that determines whether a star of a given mass can evolve into the red supergiant (RSG) phase. Metallicity influences the supergiant outcome because it modifies $R_{\\rm TAMS}$ through its effects on opacity and nuclear energy generation, as demonstrated by our stellar models and dimensional analysis based on homology relations. The value of $R_{\\rm TAMS}$ sets the initial radius for post-main-sequence expansion and therefore controls the envelope radius reached at subsequent core-evolution stages. Higher-metallicity stars develop larger $R_{\\rm TAMS}$ and rapidly expand into the stable RSG regime during core helium burning. In contrast, lower-metallicity stars have smaller $R_{\\rm TAMS}$ and advance to more evolved core helium or carbon-burning stages while retaining compact envelopes, thereby preventing expansion into the RSG regime during core helium burning. Our results explain the origin of the critical metallicity and offer insight into the evolution of metal-poor massive stars in the early universe.",

To this end, we have developed Metal Pipe, a new code for determining stellar parameters and abundances, which is designed for use across a wider range of spectral types than many commonly used codes. It combines the widely-used package MOOG with photometric stellar parameters, a user-supplied high-resolution spectrum, and a newly curated list of spectral lines. Metal Pipe outputs values for $T_{\\rm{eff}}$, $\\log{(g)}$, $M_*$, $R_*$, and $L_*$ from isochrones, and abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Ti, and Fe from MOOG. In this paper, we describe the Metal Pipe algorithm and tests of Metal Pipe against previous abundance measurements on archival HIRES spectra of 503 F, G, and K type stars. We find RMS scatters of ~100 K in $T_{\\rm{eff}}$, ~0.10 dex in $\\log{(g)}$, and ~0.10 dex for all measured abundances. These values are comparable to estimated measurement uncertainties, verifying Metal Pipe for continued use in building a detailed abundance catalog. Future papers in this series will test Metal Pipe's applicability to late K and M dwarf stars, and provide other improvements.",

Habbal, Shaheda Begum Shaik, Zachary Bailey, Nathalia Alzate, Riddhi Bandyopadhyay, Miloslav Druckmüller, Simone Di Matteo, Sage Constantinou Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) High-resolution total solar eclipse (TSE) white light (WL) images are the only observations at present to capture coronal structures over an uninterrupted field of view (FoV) of at least 10 solar radii (Rs) starting from the solar limb. They were the first to report the presence of vortex rings originating within the prominence-corona transition region (PCTR). They also captured CMEs and Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instabilities at different phases of their evolution. While the evolution of CMEs and KH waves is relatively well-documented, little is known about the survivability of vortex rings beyond the FoV of the TSE images. In this study, we use seven TSE images and non-contemporaneous WL images acquired by the Wide-Field Imager for Parker Solar PRobe (WISPR) to track the spatial evolution of vortex rings, KH waves, and CMEs. The size trend versus radial distance for vortex rings and KH waves are found to be shallower below 1.5 Rs than beyond 3 Rs, while the CMEs observed beyond 3 Rs show a unique slope. The WISPR time series yield an average speed of 249.02 +/- 25.3 km/s for the vortex rings beyond 3 Rs, that when combined with their size yields a speed of 19.39 +/- 3.20 km/s below 1 Rs. These values are remarkably consistent with the acceleration profile of the slow solar wind over the same distance. This study provides strong empirical evidence that vortex rings, which originate at the PCTR with complex magnetic structures, do not dissipate as they expand away from the Sun with the solar wind.",

By analysing the light curves of the ZZ Ceti star WD 1310+583, we aim to determine its pulsational frequencies and to give constraints on the main stellar parameters using the tools of asteroseismology. Methods. We performed the Fourier analysis of the TESS light curves of WD 1310+583 and selected the possible pulsational modes. We also used spectroscopic data collected with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph of the Hubble Space Telescope to give constraints for the asteroseismic analysis. We perform the latter with period-to-period fits using fully evolutionary white dwarf models. Results. The star presented in this paper shows a particularly large number (41) of pulsational frequencies, which provides a potential opportunity for detailed asteroseismic investigations. We found a mean period spacing of ~40.5 seconds, which allows us to state that the stellar mass of WD 1310+583 would be larger than ~0.57 M_Sun. We also attempted an asteroseismological analysis by performing period-to-period fits, but we were unable to find a single statistically significant asteroseismological solution. We adopted a tentative solution consisting of a white dwarf model with M* = 0.632 M_Sun, Teff = 11 702 K, and an asteroseismic distance d = 27.75 +0.17/-0.15 pc, which is significantly smaller than the one predicted by Gaia (d = 30.79 +/- 0.2 pc).

Rusk, Benjamin Gullick 13 pages, 9 figures, to be submitted to The Open Journal of Astrophysics Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Brown dwarfs that gain mass through binary interactions may be pushed above the boundary that divides brown dwarfs from low-mass stars: the hydrogen burning limit (HBL). Some of these objects will make their way to the main sequence and may eventually be indistinguishable from ordinary low-mass stars, while others will remain brown dwarf-like, unable to burn hydrogen at a high enough rate to power their surface luminosity. We study the evolution of both types of object to provide a taxonomy and testable observational predictions for these objects depending on their evolutionary path. Using MESA simulations, we find that a subset of the objects that will eventually become stars experience an extended luminosity plateau, where their surface luminosity remains nearly constant on 100 Myr - Gyr timescales. We find that the plateau timescale is set by the amount of energy required to re-heat the cores of these objects to a level sufficient to sustain convection. The timescales required for the cores of these objects to \"unfreeze\" and arrive at the main sequence is long enough that surveys may be able to find objects in this evolutionary stage. These objects, along with those that never reach the main sequence, occupy a unique space in a mass-luminosity diagram, and would provide a unique constraint on binary mass transfer physics.",

Heinemann, Jens Pomoell, Manuela Temmer Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) models are widely used to study the solar corona and form the basis for solar wind forecasting, yet often fail to reproduce observed properties of coronal holes. We analyze 702 observed coronal holes between 2010 and 2019 and compute corresponding PFSS magnetic field extrapolations to examine their magnetic topology and loop statistics, comparing them with quiet Sun regions. Our goal is to determine how observed coronal holes are represented in a PFSS model and to identify sources of known discrepancies. We find that low-lying loops covering the weak, balanced background field in coronal holes are statistically smaller and narrower than in quiet Sun regions, with a median height strongly correlated to the coronal holes mean magnetic flux density (cc_Pearson = 0.81). This suggests that at low altitudes, the coronal hole magnetic topology is primarily governed by its flux density, unlike in quiet Sun regions. Coronal holes also contain loops extending much higher into the corona than typical quiet Sun loops, although it is unclear if these are truly closed or reflect source surface height limitations. Overall, differences in modeled magnetic structures of coronal holes and quiet Sun regions are evident, even when the PFSS model does not indicate any open fields. These results suggest that observed coronal holes correspond to distinct photospheric magnetic structures, and that discrepancies with PFSS models reflect modeling limitations rather than the absence of coronal holes.",

By examining archival light curves for periodic signals, we identify that four of the 32 objects ($13^{+8}_{-4}$%) exhibit photometric variability. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting allowed us to derive radii, luminosities, and gravity masses, as well as to characterise the infrared excesses observed in six sources. A notable discovery is the identification of a 1.87 d period in the ZTF light curves of WD1342+443 and weak emission lines in the optical spectra of this star, which strongly indicate an irradiation effect system. Our SED fit indicates the presence of cool dust, which must be located farther from the star, and that any companion with a spectral type earlier than L2.0 would appear in the SED. This leads us to speculate that WD1342+443 might have an irradiated, sub-stellar companion. We also highlight that we uncovered, for the first time, a 4.23 d photometric period in the well-known, close DA+dM binary WD0232+035, based on TESS data. We find that the phase and amplitude of the light curve variations are consistent with expectations from an irradiation effect. Intriguingly, we detected an additional, mysterious period at 1.39 d, which is approximately one-third of the orbital period. Moreover, we revisited the longstanding discrepancy between Kiel and gravity masses for the hottest WDs. To address this, we explored fully metal line blanketed model atmospheres as a potential solution, contrasting them with the results from pure H and H+He models. Our results show that including metal opacities does not resolve the discrepancy - in fact, it slightly deteriorates the agreement. Finally, we reaffirm the previously observed correlation between He abundance and luminosity.",

Casey, Jon A. Holtzman, Timothy D. Brandt, Jose G. Fernandez-Trincado Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Applications (stat.AP) Near-infrared (NIR) detectors -- which use non-destructive readouts to measure time-series counts-per-pixel -- play a crucial role in modern astrophysics. Standard NIR flux extraction techniques were developed for space-based observations and assume that source fluxes are constant over an observation. However, ground-based telescopes often see short-timescale atmospheric variations that can dramatically change the number of photons arriving at a pixel. This work presents a new statistical model that shares information between neighboring spectral pixels to characterize time-variable observations and extract unbiased fluxes with optimal uncertainties. We generate realistic synthetic data using a variety of flux and amplitude-of-time-variability conditions to confirm that our model recovers unbiased and optimal estimates of both the true flux and the time-variable signal. We find that the time-variable model should be favored over a constant-flux model when the observed count rates change by more than 3.5%. Ignoring time variability in the data can result in flux-dependent, unknown-sign biases that are as large as ~120% of the flux uncertainty. Using real APOGEE spectra, we find empirical evidence for approximately wavelength-independent, time-dependent variations in count rates with amplitudes much greater than the 3.5% threshold. Our model can robustly measure and remove the time-dependence in real data, improving the quality of data-model comparison. We show several examples where the observed time-dependence quantitatively agrees with independent measurements of observing conditions, such as variable cloud cover and seeing.",

Wu Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Signal Processing (eess.SP); Applied Physics (physics.app-ph) The active impedance is a fundamental parameter for characterizing the behavior of large, uniform phased array antennas. However, its conventional calculation via the mutual impedance matrix (or the scattering matrix) offers limited physical intuition and can be computationally intensive. This paper presents a novel derivation of the active impedance directly from the radiated beam pattern of such arrays. This approach maps the scan-angle variation of the active impedance directly to the intrinsic angular variation of the beam, providing a more intuitive physical interpretation. The theoretical derivation is straightforward and rigorous. The validity of the proposed equation is conclusively confirmed through full-wave simulations of a prototype array. This work establishes a new and more intuitive framework for understanding, analyzing and accurately measuring the scan-dependent variations in phased arrays, which is one of the main challenges in modern phased array designs. Consequently, this novel formalism is expected to expedite and simplify the overall design and optimization process for next-generation, large-scale uniform phased arrays.",

These measurements are usually performed during bright moon periods while the instruments' primary purpose -- gamma-ray observations -- cannot be fulfilled. The Mobile Intensity Interferometer for Stellar Observations was designed as a proof of concept for a purpose-built intensity interferometer. Using acrylic Fresnel lenses 1 m in diameter with 1.2 m focal length, a compact, economical and lightweight design was realised. The detector fixture allows for translation in the z-axis to adjust for measurements at different wavelengths (and therefore focal points) and easy swapping of the detector in its entirety. Both mobility and scalability in quantity of this design allow for specific targeting of projected baselines and orientations based on the target. Particularly for potential binary systems, selective coverage of a target's u-v plane is essential to probing the characteristics accurately. A first campaign demonstrated the capability of these Fresnel lens telescopes by measuring the spatial coherence curve of Arcturus ($\\alpha$ Boo). In an observation time of less than 11 h, the angular diameter was measured with milliarcsecond precision, in agreement with the values in the literature.",

Using a neural encoder trained exclusively on non-Gaussian instrumental glitches, we perform strict zero-shot anomaly analysis on rolling-element bearings without retraining, fine-tuning, or target-domain labels. On the IMS-NASA run-to-failure dataset, the operator yields a monotonic health index HI(t) = s0.99(t)/tau normalized to an early-life reference distribution, enabling fixed false-alarm monitoring at 1-q = 1e-3 with tau = Q0.999(P0). In discrete fault regimes (CWRU), it achieves strong window-level discrimination (AUC_win about 0.90) and file-level separability approaching unity (AUC_file about 0.99). Electrically dominated vibration signals (VSB) show weak, non-selective behavior, delineating a physical boundary for transfer. Under a matched IMS controlled-split protocol, a generic EfficientNet-B0 encoder pretrained on ImageNet collapses in the intermittent regime (Lambda_tail about 2), while the interferometric operator retains strong extreme-event selectivity (Lambda_tail about 860), indicating that the effect is not a generic property of CNN features. Controlled morphology-destruction transformations selectively degrade performance despite per-window normalization, consistent with sensitivity to coherent time-frequency organization rather than marginal amplitude statistics.",

Designed to search for Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) above 10$^{21}~$eV and capable of placing a stringent upper limit on their flux at these extreme energies, paving the way to future space-based UHECR observatories, Mini-EUSO has completed more than 150 observation sessions over five years, accumulating approximately 750 hours of data. The mission has produced the first global UV emission maps of Earth and provided valuable insights into lightning phenomena and Transient Luminous Events (TLEs), such as elves, as well as artificial light sources and meteors. Notably, Mini-EUSO has conducted the first systematic space-based meteor survey, detecting over 22,000 meteors and identifying three interstellar candidates. Among the observed TLEs, the most interesting class of phenomena are elves, which appear as expanding ring-shaped structures occurring at $\\sim$90 km altitude. Mini-EUSO has detected elves with varying structures and different numbers of concentric rings, from single-ring up to five rings. Thanks to its imaging capabilities, fast time resolution, and favorable observational geometry, Mini-EUSO is uniquely suited to studying this kind of lightning phenomena, providing unprecedented insight into their dynamics. Additionally, the instrument has demonstrated the capability of a space-based detector to identify short light transients resembling extensive air shower signals while distinguishing them from those produced by UHECRs.

Open to comments from the community Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Planned and future missions, including the Habitable Worlds Observatory, will aim to image Earth-like exoplanets around Sun-like stars in reflected light. Determining whether an exoplanet is in the habitable zone of its star may be difficult in multi-planet systems when the observer does not know in advance which detection corresponds to which planet. This \"confusion\" problem will be a concern for future missions due to the high occurrence rate of multi-planet systems, and will be exacerbated by lack of prior knowledge about planets' orbital parameters or characteristics. We address the planet-detection confusion problem by developing a photometry model and new orbit ranking scheme to augment a \"deconfuser\" tool and account for phase variation exhibited by planets throughout their orbits. We demonstrate the new ranking scheme as a proof-of-concept on a subset of highly confused simulated multi-planet systems among three inclination groupings (low, medium, and high). We find that incorporating photometry improves differentiation of previously confused orbits in more than half of these particularly challenging cases. These results emphasize that photometry is useful for orbit discrimination and deconfusion of directly imaged multi-planet systems, and should be considered when fitting orbits to detections.",

Owen Accepted for publication in MNRAS Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We investigate the long-term impact of disc photoevaporation on the dynamical stability and evolution of giant planet pairs in mean motion resonances. Using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with FARGO3D, in which we have included mass-loss due to photoevaporation, we explore a parameter space covering disc mass, viscosity, planet mass, and resonance type. We find that strong photoevaporation depletes gas in the common gap between the planets, slowing migration and suppressing planet-disc interactions that typically lead to resonance breaking and eccentricity damping. This stabilising effect is most significant for 3:2 resonances, which are more prone to disruption due to the reduced planet spacing. In contrast, 2:1 resonances are generally more robust but can still be destabilised at high disc mass and moderate-to-strong photoevaporation due to asymmetric torques. Photoevaporation can therefore stabilise resonances that would otherwise break, or conversely disrupt resonances that are natively more stable. Even in cases where photoevaporation does not directly affect resonance stability, it typically results in increased planetary eccentricities. These results highlight the complex, system-dependent nature of resonance evolution, with implications for the final orbital architectures of giant planet systems and their detectability via astrometry from missions such as Gaia.",

Since their initial discovery around 47 UMa, they have attracted significant interest, yet their formation mechanisms remain uncertain, underscoring the need to expand the known population. In this work, we combine RV data with Gaia astrometry using Hipparcos-Gaia proper-motion anomalies over a 25-year baseline. By jointly modeling both datasets with the MCMC framework, we constrain planetary masses, orbital inclinations, and three-dimensional orbital architectures. This reduces RV degeneracies and improves mass determinations. Four cold Jupiters are reported: HD 68475 b and HD 100508 b are each the first confirmed planet in their systems, with orbital periods $7832_{-323}^{+463}$ d and $5681\\pm42$ d and dynamical masses of $5.16_{-0.47}^{+0.53} M_{\\text{Jup}}$ and $1.2_{-0.18}^{+0.30} M_{\\text{Jup}}$, respectively.

HD 68475 b is a promising candidate for future direct imaging with ELT/METIS. We identified a Jupiter analog with the longest known orbital period among planets with masses between 0.5 and 2 $M_{\\text{Jup}}$, implying that a substantial population of cold Jupiters likely awaits discovery by Gaia.

Effects of diffraction, interferences, and stellar diameter Bruno Sicardy, Luc Dettwiller 20 pages, 15 figures, 3 tables, accepted in Astronomy and Astrophysics Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Central flashes occur during stellar occultations by solar system objects. We catalog diffraction effects on the flash with point-like stars, monochromatic waves and spherical transparent atmosphere. Diffraction involves the Huygens principle, the Sommerfeld lemma and the stationary phase method, while finite stellar diameter cases involve Clausius' theorem. For point-like stars, the central flash shape is that of the classical Poisson spot, but with larger height. For tenuous atmospheres that cannot focus the stellar rays at shadow center, the flash is amplified by the factor (R_0/r_0)^2 compared to the Poisson spot, where R0 and r0 are the object and the shadow radii, respectively. For denser atmospheres that can focus the rays at shadow center, the flash peaks at 2[(pi*R/lambda_F})^2]*phi0, where R is the central flash layer radius, lambda_F is the Fresnel scale and phi0 is the flux that would be observed at shadow center without focusing. For isothermal atmospheres with scale height H, the height is 2(R*H)(pi/lambda_F)^2. Fringes surrounding the central flash are separated by lambda_P=lambda_F^2/R, related to the separation between the primary and secondary stellar images. For a projected stellar diameter D*>lambda_P, the flash is described by complete elliptic integrals, and has full width at half maximum of 1.14D* and peak value 8H/D*. For Earth-based occultations by Pluto and Triton observed in the visible with point-like stars, diffraction causes flashes with very large heights ~10e4-10e5, spread over a very small meter-sized region in the shadow plane. In practice, the flash is usually smoothed by the stellar diameter, but still reaches high values of ~50 and ~200 during Pluto and Triton occultations, respectively. Diffraction dominates when using millimeter wavelengths or longer. Effects of departure from sphericity, atmospheric waves and stellar limb darkening are discussed.",

Sturm 21 pages, 11 figures, published in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Direct observations of exoplanet and brown dwarf companions with near-infrared interferometry, first enabled by the dual-field mode of VLTI/GRAVITY, provide unique measurements of the objects' orbital motions and atmospheric compositions. Here, we compile a homogeneous library of all exoplanet and brown dwarf K-band spectra observed by GRAVITY thus far. We re-reduced all the available GRAVITY dual-field high-contrast data and, where companions are detected, extract their ~2.0-2.4 $\\mu$m K-band contrast spectra. We then derived stellar model atmospheres for all employed flux references, which we used to convert the companion contrast into companion flux spectra. Solely from the resulting GRAVITY spectra, we extracted spectral types, spectral indices, and bulk physical properties for all companions. Finally, and with the help of age constraints from the literature, we also derived isochronal masses for most companions using evolutionary models. The resulting library contains R ~ 500 GRAVITY spectra of 39 substellar companions from late M to late T spectral types, including the entire L-T transition. Throughout this transition, a shift from CO-dominated late M- and L-type dwarfs to CH4-dominated T-type dwarfs can be observed in the K-band. The GRAVITY spectra alone constrain the objects' bolometric luminosity to typically within $\\pm$0.15 dex. The derived isochronal masses agree with dynamical masses from the literature where available, except for HD 4113 c for which we confirm its previously reported potential underluminosity. Medium-resolution spectroscopy of substellar companions with GRAVITY provides insight into the carbon chemistry and the cloudiness of these objects' atmospheres. It also constrains these objects' bolometric luminosities which can yield measurements of their formation entropy if combined with dynamical masses, for instance from Gaia and GRAVITY astrometry.",

      "abstract": "A JWST Transit of a Jupiter Analog I: Constraints on the Oblateness of Kepler-167e Ben Cassese, David Kipping, Quentin Changeat, Daniel A. Yahalomi, Justin Vega, Yayaati Chachan, Billy Edwards, Alex Teachey Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) In October 2024 JWST observed a transit of Kepler-167e, a Jupiter-analog planet on a 1000+ day orbit. These observations, recorded over a long baseline of nearly 60 hours, were designed to search for signatures of planetary oblateness and/or exomoons comparable to Ganymede. In this first in a series of studies analyzing these data we report on constraints on Kepler-167e's oblateness. We explored a large grid of data reduction pipelines and modeling choices, including a new entirely independent reduction pipeline (\"katahdin\") and two new treatments for limb darkening. We find that under a Bayesian model comparison framework the data are fit equally well by both spherical and oblate planet models, and that our ability to constrain the oblateness is negatively impacted by the influence of exposure-long trends. Using the most conservative of our posteriors, we place a 95% upper bound on the projected oblateness of $f<0.097$, which corresponds to a rotation period of $P\\geq7.11$ hours if the planet's spin axis is aligned with the sky plane. We note, however, that the final bound depends on the choice of reduction pipeline and systematics model, and that our suite of end-to-end analyses produced bounds as low as $f<0.065$ at 95%. We conclude that leveraging JWST to make tighter constraints on planetary oblateness will require further investigation into mitigating exposure-long trends and correlated noise.",
