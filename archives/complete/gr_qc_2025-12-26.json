Restricting to the stringy value $\\gamma=1$ of the dilaton coupling constant, we report on the existence of a one parameter family of eBHs which are free of pathologies, provided their magnetic and electric charges are equal. An understanding of this condition is found from a study of the near horizon limit of the solutions, both perturbative closed form and numerical solutions being presented.",

Comments are welcome General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The coming decade will be crucial for determining the final design and configuration of a global network of next-generation (XG) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, including the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE). In this study and for the first time, we assess the performance of various network configurations using neural posterior estimation (NPE) implemented in Dingo-IS-a method based on normalizing flows and importance sampling that enables fast and accurate inference. We focus on a specific science case involving short-duration, massive and high-redshift binary black hole (BBH) mergers with detector-frame chirp masses $M_{\\mathrm{d}} > 100$ M$_\\odot$. These systems encompass early-Universe stellar and primordial black holes, as well as intermediate-mass black-hole binaries, for which XG observatories are expected to deliver major discoveries. Validation against standard Bayesian inference demonstrates that NPE robustly reproduces complex and disconnected posterior structures across all network configurations. For a network of two misaligned L-shaped ET detectors (2L MisA), the posterior distributions on luminosity distance can become multimodal and degenerate with the sky position, leading to less precise distance estimates compared to the triangular ET configuration. However, the number of sky-location multimodalities is substantially lower than the eight expected with the triangular ET, resulting in improved sky and volume localization. Adding CE to the network further reduces sky-position degeneracies, and the better performance of the 2L MisA configuration over the triangle remains evident.",

      "abstract": "Visualization and analysis of the curvature invariants in the Alcubierre warp-drive spacetime José Rodal General Relativity and Gravitation, Published: 18 November 2023, Volume 55, article number 134, (2023) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In the Alcubierre warp-drive spacetime, we investigate the following scalar curvature invariants: the scalar $I$, derived from a quadratic contraction of the Weyl tensor, the trace $R$ of the Ricci tensor, and the quadratic $r1$ and cubic $r2$ invariants from the trace-adjusted Ricci tensor. In four-dimensional spacetime the trace-adjusted Einstein and Ricci tensors are identical, and their unadjusted traces are oppositely signed yet equal in absolute value. This allows us to express these Ricci invariants using Einstein's curvature tensor, facilitating a direct interpretation of the energy-momentum tensor. We present detailed plots illustrating the distribution of these invariants. Our findings underscore the requirement for four distinct layers of an anisotropic stress-energy tensor to create the warp bubble. Additionally, we delve into the Kretschmann quadratic invariant decomposition. We provide a critical analysis of the work by Mattingly et al., particularly their underrepresentation of curvature invariants in their plots by 8 to 16 orders of magnitude. A comparison is made between the spacetime curvature of the Alcubierre warp-drive and that of a Schwarzschild black hole with a mass equivalent to the planet Saturn. The paper addresses potential misconceptions about the Alcubierre warp-drive due to inaccuracies in representing spacetime curvature changes and clarifies the classification of the Alcubierre spacetime, emphasizing its distinction from class $B$ warped product spacetimes.",

Despite the extensive study of $f(R,T)$ gravity, the asymptotic implications of quadratic trace couplings in scalar field cosmology remain largely unexplored. We focus on a specific form given by $ f(R,T^\\phi) = R + \\alpha T^\\phi + \\beta (T^\\phi)^2/2$, in which the parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ control the strength of non-minimal couplings between geometry and matter. We derive the set of cosmological equations for a spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic universe and construct the autonomous system of first-order differential equations using a compact set of dimensionless variables. This formulation provides a foundation for the qualitative analysis of the asymptotic behavior. We identify and classify all critical points and analyze their stability properties. Finally, the energy conditions and the presence of dynamical instabilities are examined. We study the general scenario $\\alpha \\neq 0$ and $\\beta \\neq 0$, along with the subcases $\\alpha = 0$ and $\\beta = 0$, in order to compare with minimally coupled quintessence $\\alpha = \\beta = 0$. We find that the quadratic term in $T^\\phi$ admits late-time accelerated de Sitter-like critical solutions at the background level. However, several accelerated points lie in a degenerate scalar sector with $Q_s=0$, where the standard linear perturbation criteria are inconclusive, while the quasi-de Sitter point with $Q_s>0$ is of saddle type. Therefore, establishing full perturbative viability requires going beyond the linear analysis in the degenerate sector.",

They play extremely important roles in black hole shadows, gravitational lensings, quasi-normal modes, and spacetime topological properties. The development of analytical methods for these circular orbits has also drawn extensive attention. In our recent work, \\href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. D \\textbf{106}, L021501 (2022)}, a geometric approach to circular photon orbits was proposed for spherically symmetric spacetimes. In the present study, we give an extension of this geometric approach from spherically symmetric spacetimes to axially symmetric rotational spacetimes. In such a geometric approach, light rings in the equatorial plane are determined through the intrinsic curvatures in the optical geometry of Lorentz spacetime, which gives rise to a Randers-Finsler geometry for axially symmetric spacetimes. Specifically, light rings can be precisely determined by the condition of vanishing geodesic curvature, and the stability of light rings is classified through the intrinsic flag curvature in Randers-Finsler optical geometry. This geometric approach presented in this work is generally applicable to any stationary and axially symmetric spacetime, without imposing any restriction on the spacetime metric forms. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous demonstration to show that our geometric approach yields completely equivalent results with those derived from the conventional approach (based on the effective potential of photons).",

In this work, we seeked for a possibility of realising the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole as a correlated qubit system, where each of the event horizon is treated as a qubit and both of them are correlated in a way that two qubits could be. By identifying the entropies of subsystems to those of qubits, we successfully constructed the reduced density matrices of the two subsystems as well as the density matrix for the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole, modelled as 2-correlating qubits. Moreover, our results suggested that when the gravitational effect has its role in the qubit systems, supposedly like black holes, the correlation between qubits are constrained with a lower bound more stringent than the so-called Araki-Lieb triangle inequality.",

Venkataratnam General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) In this work, we present a comprehensive semiclassical analysis of black hole radiation in a spatially flat FRW Universe for two fundamental nonclassical states: the Squeezed Number State (SNS) and the Coherent Squeezed Number State (CSNS). Unlike thermally modified earlier studies, SNS and CSNS constitute fully non-thermal, number-state-dependent quantum configurations. By embedding these states within the framework of semiclassical theory of gravity, we derive state-resolved expressions for the Hawking temperature, entropy variation, and corresponding mass loss of an evaporating black hole. The influence of the squeezing parameter $\\rho$ and number state parameter $n$ on Hawking emission is examined through a series of analytical results supported by twelve detailed plots. The analysis reveals that the Hawking temperature exhibits monotonic growth with increasing $\\rho$ and $n$, thereby elevating the effective temperature experienced at the black hole horizon. The entropy variations $\\Delta \\mathbb{S}_{\\mathrm{SNS}}$ and $\\Delta \\mathbb{S}_{\\mathrm{CSNS}}$ show strong nonlinear enhancement, especially at moderate and large squeezing values. Overall, the study extends earlier thermal squeezed-state approaches to a fully number-state-resolved framework, highlighting the sensitivity of Hawking emission to nonclassical quantum configurations.

We develop a hybrid numerical framework to signify nonperturbative effects on the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background sourced by primordial curvature perturbations, focusing on the acoustic channel (fluid motions). Fully general-relativistic, spherically symmetric simulations are used to extract nonperturbative sound-shell profiles from isolated curvature peaks; these profiles are then embedded into three-dimensional lattice evolutions of relativistic hydrodynamics coupled to transverse-traceless metric perturbations to compute the acoustic GW spectra. The acoustic signal has a peak frequency determined by the comoving shell thickness, and its amplitude is extremely sensitive to the mean comoving separation of peaks, scaling approximately as $R_{*c}^{-7}$. We find a robust causal low-frequency tail $\\propto k^{3}$, and the nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions can enhance the ultraviolet power. Comparing with SIGWs computed perturbatively from the same real-space configuration, we show that acoustic GWs can be amplified by an order of magnitude and display a peak shifted to a lower frequency in the large-amplitude regime. These results highlight the importance of nonperturbative effects for accurate predictions of stochastic GW signals induced from primordial curvature perturbations.",

We demonstrate that a natural one-parameter generalization to a quadratic model $\\sim L+L^2$ in the Lovelock invariant $L=R+\\frac{\\alpha}{4}{\\cal G}$ ($\\cal G$ is the Gauss--Bonnet term), can effectively resolve this minor tension. Scalar-tensor formulation of this theory yields an Einstein-frame Starobinsky-type scalar potential augmented by Gauss--Bonnet and derivative couplings, which modify the inflationary slow-roll dynamics. We show that a non-zero coupling $\\alpha$ for the Gauss-Bonnet term can shift $(n_s, r)$ along a trajectory that brings the predictions into better agreement with the ACT likelihood. We also find that $L+L^2$ gravity, in its scalar-tensor formulation, is equivalent to Higgs inflation coupled to the Gauss--Bonnet term, and belongs to the Horndeski/galileon class of modified gravities.

By classifying these spacetimes into three fundamental types, Type I (Kretschmann scalar K_max increasing with mass M), Type II (mass-independent K_max), and Type III (K_max decreasing with M), we demonstrate how subtle variations in the core geometry imprint distinguishable features on the BH shadow. A detailed analysis of photon dynamics reveals that the parameters {\\alpha} and n, which control the deviation from Schwarzschild geometry and the radial decay of the regularizing factor, respectively, systematically alter the properties of the photon sphere. These intrinsic geometric differences propagate outward: for fixed parameters, Type III BHs, with the most compact photon sphere, produce the smallest and brightest shadows, whereas Type I BHs yield the largest and dimmest ones. Shadow computations under both static and infalling spherical accretion models confirm that the curvature-based classification directly corresponds to observable differences. Critically, Type III BHs exhibit the strongest sensitivity to parameter variations, making them optimal probes for constraining the underlying spacetime geometry. Our work reveals that even among nonsingular BHs sharing the same asymptotic core, differences in internal curvature are reflected in the shadow morphology, thereby providing a new pathway to test quantum-gravity-inspired models using upcoming high-resolution observations.",

Comments are welcome General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Gravitational waves provide a unique window into gravity, cosmology, and high-energy physics, enabling the exploration of fundamental phenomena across a wide range of scales. This review presents a coherent and pedagogical framework that bridges foundational theory with observational frontiers. We begin by developing the theory of gravitational radiation within linearized general relativity, deriving gravitational waves as solutions to the linearized Einstein equations and clarifying their physical interpretation, polarization states, and key properties. We then deepen the discussion through a geometric perspective, tracing the connection between gravitational radiation and the algebraic structure of the Weyl tensor and its role in defining energy and angular momentum in asymptotically flat spacetimes. Extending beyond flat backgrounds, we examine gravitational waves in an expanding universe, following their evolution across cosmological epochs and their generation during inflation. Within this setting, we discuss adiabatic modes and consistency relations that reveal universal properties of long-wavelength perturbations, and derive the inflationary spectrum of vacuum gravitational waves together with their contribution to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. We also survey the main observational strategies for detecting gravitational waves across a broad frequency range, including cosmic microwave background polarization, pulsar timing arrays, ground- and space-based laser interferometers, and resonant cavity detectors. We then discuss the astrophysical and cosmological mechanisms responsible for generating gravitational radiation. We conclude by summarizing the current status of the field and outlining promising directions for future theoretical and observational developments.",

Unfortunately, it turned out to be very difficult of getting consistent massive gravity theory due, among other things, to ghost appearance and strong coupling break-down problems. Of course, even though since the work of de Rham, Gabadadge and Tolley; the ghost problem appears overcame; things remain unchanged for the strong coupling break-down problem which is the problem that a massive gravity of experimentally viable graviton mass $m$ has (in comparison of standard massless gravity theory) a very low cutoff-scale $\\Lambda_3= \\Big[m^2M_P\\Big]^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ above which the theory fails; a problem what must be resolved if we want massive gravity be a consistent physical theory which can pretend to describe nature. Now as we know, one of the better way of overcoming this strong coupling break-down problem of massive gravity is to have a dynamical Higgs mechanism for gravity capable of providing a clear-cut way of making the graviton massless dynamically above the cutoff-scale $\\Lambda_3$; a challenge what turned out to be difficult to surmount. It is this difficult that I overcome in the present paper by showing that it is quite possible of getting a four-dimensional modified massless gravity theory which becomes dynamically massive through for example the dynamical standard model electroweak phase transition. More precisely, I propose the first example of dynamical Higgs mechanism for dRGT gravity permitting to overcome the strong coupling break-down problem of dRGT gravity.",

Based on recent works: arXiv:2409.02200, arXiv:2505.01272 General Physics (physics.gen-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We explore the paradigm of pre-geometric gravity, where spacetime geometry and the gravitational field are not fundamental but emerge from the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of a larger gauge symmetry. Specifically, we consider a gauge theory based on the de Sitter $SO(1,4)$ or anti-de Sitter $SO(3,2)$ group, formulated on a manifold without a prior metric structure. General covariance is maintained by constructing Lagrangian densities using the Levi-Civita symbol. The SSB is triggered by an internal vector field $\\phi^A$, which reduces the symmetry to the Lorentz group $SO(1,3)$ and dynamically generates a spacetime metric. We analyze two specific models: the MacDowell-Mansouri formulation, which yields the Einstein-Hilbert action plus a cosmological constant and a Gauss-Bonnet term, and the Wilczek model, which produces a pure Einstein-Hilbert action with a cosmological constant. In both cases, the observed Planck mass and the small cosmological constant emerge from a see-saw mechanism dependent on the symmetry-breaking scale. We then present the Hamiltonian formulation of this pre-geometric theory, demonstrating that it possesses three number of physical degrees of freedom, corresponding to a massless graviton and a massive scalar. Integrating out the massive scalar, the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner Hamiltonian of General Relativity is obtained after SSB. This establishes a foundational bridge between pre-geometric theories and canonical quantum gravity approaches like Loop Quantum Gravity, and allows for the formulation of a pre-geometric Wheeler-DeWitt equation.",

      "abstract": "Testing conformal gravity using the supermassive black hole NGC 4258 Diego A. Martínez-Valera, Alfredo Herrera-Aguilar General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this paper, we perform a Bayesian statistical fit to estimate the free parameters of a nonsingular black hole in conformal gravity by employing megamaser astrophysical data of the supermassive black hole hosted at the center of the active galactic nucleus of NGC 4258. This estimation has been carried out by taking into account a general relativistic approach, which makes use of the positions on the sky of the photon sources and the frequency shift observations from the water megamaser system in circular motion around the black hole. Within the framework of conformal gravity, a way to eliminate the singularity at r = 0 from the Schwarzschild spacetime is by introducing a conformal factor characterized by a length scale parameter l and an integer parameter N. Therefore, the spacetime geometry depends on the mass of the black hole, and the conformal gravity parameters l and N. In this work, we estimate the mass-to-distance ratio M/D and the length scale ratio l/D with fixed values of the integer parameter N = 1, 2, considering the geodesics of conformally/non-conformally coupled massive particles. This method leads to posterior Gaussian distributions for all parameters, thus yielding a most probable value for the parameter l for both conformally/non-conformally coupled particles, in contrast to previous constraints based on X-ray astrophysical data, where an upper bound for the parameter l has been established. Furthermore, we obtain new physical properties regarding the existence of the ISCO radius for this nonsingular spacetime in the case of non-conformally coupled particles.",

B 872 (2026) 140092 General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate the scenario of black holes coupled with the Euler-Heisenberg nonlinear electromagnetic field in the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity. The black hole solutions for electrically charged, magnetically charged and the dyonic case are separately analyzed, and we discuss the scalar curvature and the energy conditions of the black hole spacetime. In the magnetic charge solution, the $f(R,T)$ correction appears in the $1/r^6$ Euler-Heisenberg electromagnetic field correction term, while the electrically charged black hole solution exhibits an $r^2$ term in the metric function, corresponding to an effective cosmological constant $\\Lambda_\\text{eff} = \\beta/(3\\pi)$, inducing asymptotically anti-de Sitter or de Sitter spacetimes depending on the sign of the coupling parameter $\\beta$. The dyonic solution is obtained through vacuum polarization quantum electrodynamics corrections, where electromagnetic duality is broken and the solution contains higher-order correction terms. The relationship between the event horizon and charge of dyonic extreme black holes is studied. Furthermore, we investigate the effective metric, photon trajectories, and innermost stable circular orbit under nonlinear electromagnetic effects, providing images of photon geodesic for varying electric and magnetic charge strengths and $f(R,T)$ coupling parameter.",

      "abstract": "Black Holes as Non-Abelian Anyon Condensates: Implications for the Information Paradox Sabin Roman General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We model black holes as condensates of non-Abelian anyons forming a thin, topologically ordered, timelike shell located just outside the would-be horizon, while the interior settles into a regular, effectively empty constant-curvature vacuum. The horizon degrees of freedom are described by a finite, constrained fusion Hilbert space whose dimension, together with a quantized area spectrum, reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and yields logarithmic and inverse-area corrections. To characterize the shell's thermodynamics, we introduce an effective collective Hamiltonian with global constraint modes; fluctuations of these constrained modes generate a logarithmic entropy correction that is consistent with the corrections obtained from area quantization. Combining the fusion-state degeneracy with the discrete area spectrum leads to a nonuniform, discrete black-hole mass spectrum and a corresponding thermally weighted emission profile. The Hawking temperature is recovered at leading order from classical equipartition on the shell, with systematic corrections controlled by the discrete spectrum. Quantum information is stored nonlocally in the fusion channels of the condensate, providing a finite microscopic Hilbert space for horizon degrees of freedom without explicitly invoking bulk trans-horizon entanglement. To address formation and consistency, we embed the shell in conformal gravity, used as an effective classical framework in the high-curvature regime, and construct a local, nonsingular matching between the regular interior, the shell, and a Schwarzschild-like exterior. The framework implies microscopic spectral discreteness and, for weak shell reflectivity, the possibility of late-time gravitational-wave echoes. Overall, our results provide a concrete microscopic model for black-hole thermodynamics and connect horizon microphysics to ideas from topological quantum computation.",

We focus on a higher-order Generalized Uncertainty Principle, beyond the quadratic form. This generalized GUP introduces two free parameters, and we determine the modified Friedmann equation. This framework leads to a perturbative cosmological model that naturally reduces to $\\Lambda$CDM in an appropriate limiting case of the deformation parameters. We construct the modified cosmological scenario, analyze its deviations from the standard case, and examine it as a mechanism for the description of dynamical dark energy. To constrain the model, we employ Cosmic Chronometers, the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from the DESI DR2 release, and Supernova data from the PantheonPlus and Union3 catalogues. Our analysis indicates that the modified GUP model is statistically competitive with the $\\Lambda$CDM scenario, providing comparable or even improved fits to some of the combined datasets. Moreover, the data constrain the deformation parameter of the GUP model, with the preferred value found to be negative, which corresponds to a phantom regime in the effective dynamical dark energy description.",

In the geometric optics approximation, waves follow null geodesics to the singularity. However, outside the geometric optics regime, the behavior of wave propagation can be rich and nuanced, even in such extreme habitats. In this work, we show that axial gravitational perturbations in the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole can form overdamped (non-oscillatory) quasibound states that decay before reaching the singularity. Using Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates to avoid coordinate ambiguities, we identify these modes and analyze their eigenfunctions. Contrary to earlier claims, we find that the Regge-Wheeler master function of these modes have non-zero amplitude at the future event horizon but decay before interacting with the singularity. We consider observations of the modes along timelike geodesics. This work suggests that certain gravitational fluctuations can hover transiently within the black-hole interior, challenging common assumptions about wave behavior in uncharted and extreme regions of spacetime.",
