      "abstract": "Gravitational Waves from the Big Bang Lucas Martins Barreto Alves General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) For millennia, humanity has relied exclusively on light$\\unicode{x2014}$initially visible light and, later, broader and broader portions of the electromagnetic spectrum$\\unicode{x2014}$to observe the universe. In the past decade, a remarkable chapter in extending astronomy beyond electromagnetic antennas has been concretized: the dawn of gravitational-wave astronomy has opened a new observational window into the cosmos. Among the many new astronomical sources we may now look for and study through their gravitational-wave signals, the Big Bang is surely among the most fascinating. Gravitational waves give us concrete hope of directly observing the primordial universe, whose light, emitted more than 13.7 billion years ago, is blocked from reaching our telescopes. This dissertation is aimed at the study of gravitational waves from cosmic inflation, the main scientific paradigm for the very early universe. Therefore, the text is divided into chapters on gravitational waves, inflationary cosmology, and inflationary gravitational waves. More specifically, our discussion will be steered by the endeavor to explain how the gravitational-wave signal sought by the NANOGrav observatory could have originated in the primordial universe.",

      "abstract": "Krylov Complexity in Canonical Quantum Cosmology Meysam Motaharfar, Maxwell R. Siebersma, Parampreet Singh General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph) We explore Krylov complexity for two exactly solvable models, one in the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) quantum cosmology and another in loop quantum cosmology (LQC), for a spatially flat, homogeneous, and isotropic universe sourced with a massless scalar field, which serves the role of clock. While the WDW quantization of this model cannot avoid the big bang/big crunch singularity, it is replaced by a big bounce in LQC. We construct the Krylov basis analytically by applying the Lanczos algorithm and evaluate both the Krylov state and operator complexity. In regimes where the wave function of the universe is sharply peaked, our results indicate that the Krylov complexity grows quadratically with the scalar field clock for the state and operator complexities in both the WDW quantum cosmology and LQC. We further show that operator complexity is exactly twice the state complexity in these regimes. We discuss the interpretation of the global behavior of these systems by calculating the Krylov entropy for both quantum cosmological frameworks. We observe that in LQC, the Krylov complexity and entropy remain finite at the bounce, whereas in the WDW quantum cosmology, they diverge at the big bang/crunch singularity. Our work paves the way for computing Krylov complexity in more intricate quantum cosmological models, including those exhibiting phenomena such as quantum chaos.",

      "abstract": "Efficient Search for Detection Candidates Using a Peak Finder Strategy for All-Sky-All-Frequency Gravitational Wave Radiometer Arindam Sharma, Deepali Agarwal, Sanjit Mitra General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The first all-sky-all-frequency (ASAF) radiometer search was conducted using data from the first three observing runs of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. The significance of this search lies in its fast and unmodeled approach, leveraging a cross-correlation technique to identify common signals across the detector network. As a result, this method serves as an excellent alternative to search for unknown or poorly modeled continuous wave sources and narrowband components of the gravitational wave (GW) background. For continuous wave sources whose waveform can be modeled, this method can serve as the first stage of a hierarchical scheme by identifying sub-threshold candidates to be followed up with more optimal but computationally expensive searches. The ASAF search, however, presently suffers from beam smearing, where multiple candidates may arise due to the same noise fluctuations, detector artifact, or a GW source. This can reduce the detection probability in follow-up analyzes, especially with limited computing resources. To mitigate this issue and reduce the number of correlated and unnecessary candidates, we introduce a novel Peak Finder algorithm. This algorithm helps identifying the most representative candidates while preserving detection sensitivity, thereby allowing follow up of a much larger number of independent candidates. The reduction in correlated samples leads to a significant reduction in False Dismissal Rate (FDR) using the Peak Finder method compared to the Full-sky method. For instance, following up 2 Peak Finder candidates at 30 Hz reduces FDR by a factor of 3.",

Gavrilik 13 pages (two-column sty), 6 figures, to appear in Ukrainian Journal of Physics General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) In this paper, we derive the $\\mu$-deformed Einstein field equations from the generalized thermodynamic functions of the $\\mu$-deformed analog of Bose gas model, applying the (adapted) Verlinde's approach. The basic role of deformation parameter is shown: it provides the possibility to vary the value of the cosmological constant. Due to this, we suggest an interesting treatment of the cosmological constant (CC) problem within the framework of $\\mu$-deformation. Namely, viewing the derived $\\mu$-deformed CC as an effective one and varying the parameter $\\mu$ appropriately, we gain the possibility to drastically reduce the CC, so as to get for it the realistic value.

Conventional Wave Front Sensing technique (WFS), which relies on the beat between the carrier and phase-modulated (PM) sidebands, is dominated by arm-axis signals when the carrier resonates in the full interferometer. This dominance limits the detection of other optical axes, such as the Power Recycling Cavity (PRC) and incident beam axes. To address this problem, we propose a novel sensing technique, \"Phase-Modulated-sideband $\\times$ Phase-Modulated-sideband Wave Front Sensing\" (PMPMWFS), which demodulates the beat signal at the difference frequency between two anti-resonant PM sidebands. We derived the theoretical response of PMPMWFS and experimentally demonstrated it using the Power-Recycled X-arm (PRXARM) configuration of KAGRA. The results show that PMPMWFS effectively decouples angular fluctuation signals of the PRC and incident beam from those of the arm cavity and provides orthogonal signal components for the end mirror of the arm cavity. Furthermore, feedback control using PMPMWFS achieved stable interferometer locking for over one hour. These results demonstrate that PMPMWFS offers an effective sensing method for decoupling multiple alignment degrees of freedom in future gravitational-wave detectors.",

On the backdrop of this concept, this paper introduces a novel, anisotropic compact star model whose stability and structure are governed by the presence of quintessence field, defined by the parameter $ w_{Q} (-1<w_{Q}<-\\frac{1}{3}) $ and which admits conformal symmetry. The construction of the model relied on the Durgapal-Fuloria (DP) metric formulation.

To explore the dark energy behavior, we assume an oscillatory parametric equation of state, $\\omega(z) = \\omega_0 + b \\sin[\\log(1+z)]$, which allows smooth deviations from the cosmological constant. Using a joint MCMC analysis with the latest Hubble 31 chronometer data, DESI DR2 BAO measurements, and Type Ia supernova samples (Pantheon+, DES-SN5Y and Union 3), we obtain well-constrained parameters around $H_0 \\simeq 67.2~\\text{km s}^{-1}\\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\\omega_0\\approx-0.5$, consistent with Planck 2018 and other current observations.

Ghosh General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate strong gravitational lensing by a charged loop quantum gravity (LQG) black hole obtained through the polymerisation scheme of Borges \\textit{et al.} \\cite{Borges:2023fog}. These effective geometries replace the Reissner--Nordström singularity with a symmetric transition surface and admit an extremal, cold remnant determined by the minimal area gap in LQG. In turn, we derive the null geodesic equations, investigate the photon effective potential, and obtain expressions for the photon-sphere radius and critical impact parameter. We compute the weak-field deflection angle and Einstein ring size, highlighting the deviations induced by the polymerisation parameter and the Barbero--Immirzi parameter. In the strong-field regime, we compute the strong deflection coefficients $(\\bar{a},\\bar{b})$ and evaluate the lensing observables $\\theta_\\infty$, $s$, and $r_{\\rm mag}$. Unlike the Reissner--Nordström case, the LQG corrections enhance the deflection angle and increase the angular separation of relativistic images, with deviations growing as the geometry approaches the LQG remnant limit. We further compute the corresponding observables for Sgr~A* and M87*, finding that the quantum-gravity modifications lie within the potential sensitivity of next-generation VLBI facilities. For M87*, the angular separation $s\\in(0.05712,0.19123)\\,\\mu\\text{as}$, while it is $s\\in(0.07595,0.25426)\\,\\mu\\text{as}$ for Sgr A*.

Abstract shortened to meet arXiv policy requirements General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) In this work we examine the internal structure of compact stars within an extended gravitational framework described by the function $f(\\mathcal{R},\\mathcal{G},\\mathcal{T})$. Throughout this work, the quantity $\\mathcal{R}$ refers to the curvature scalar formed from the Ricci tensor. The term $\\mathcal{G}$ denotes the Gauss--Bonnet curvature invariant, while $\\mathcal{T}$ corresponds to the trace obtained by contracting the matter energy-momentum tensor. Our analysis is directed toward massive radio pulsars with masses above $1.8\\,M_{\\odot}$, which provide an exceptional testing ground for gravity under conditions inaccessible to laboratory experiments.

The results indicate that in all the three cases, the charged black hole spacetime undergoes scalarization at low temperatures. Notably, the spherical topology is unique in that its domain of scalarization theoretically extends to much higher temperatures under low pressure in the extended phase space. Moreover, the scalarization process in the spherical case exhibits complex phase transition behaviors without additional non-linear terms, which are similar to those in the planar and hyperbolic topologies with the assistance of non-linear terms. With increasing pressure in the extended phase space, the condensate of the scalarization in all three cases undergoes a transition from the first-order style to a cave-of-wind style. This study provides deeper insight into the zeroth-order phase transition during black hole scalarization and reveals the complete phase structure of black holes in the extended phase space.",

These spacetimes violated the Weak Energy Condition (WEC). Lentz proposed a new type of warp drive in 2020. It was claimed that this warp spacetime has non-negative energy density and can therefore be sourced by a classical plasma. We demonstrate that Lentz's claim is incorrect. We begin with a direct calculation of the energy-momentum tensor of Lentz's warp drive in a Eulerian reference frame, and show that there are spacetime regions where the energy density is negative. We then examine the theoretical basis of Lentz's investigation and identify several derivation errors. The derivation errors can be somewhat ameliorated with a modified version of Lentz's geometry, which more closely respects the equalities and inequalities discussed by Lentz. Even so, we show that the modified geometry still violates the WEC even in the Eulerian reference frame. We conclude with a brief discussion of no-go theorems and their relationship to geometries of the kind proposed by Lentz.",

The secondary compact object, carrying a Proca hair, emits additional dipolar radiation that alters total energy flux relative to general relativity (GR). These modifications induce a secular drift in the orbital evolution of circular geodesic orbits, leading to measurable dephasing in the resulting EMRIs waveforms. By evaluating waveform mismatches between the Einstein-Proca framework and its GR counterpart, we show that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can distinguish the signatures of a light Proca field when black hole rotation is included. Furthermore, using a Fisher information matrix analysis, we forecast LISA's capability to place stringent constraints on the Proca mass with EMRIs signal from slowly rotating Kerr black holes. For representative EMRIs configurations, we find that LISA can detect or constrain Proca masses down to $\\mu_v\\sim 10^{-20}$eV, with typical fractional uncertainties at the level of tens percent, depending on the black-hole spin.",

Using impact parameters, we identify a closed subset of parameter space, the inner throat, where the radial potential has no real roots, and photons exhibit no radial turning points. In this region, at most two constant-latitude geodesics exist, one of which is aligned with the principal null direction. We also identify the forbidden polar-angle band that limits the range of geodesics reaching an asymptotic observer. We solve the geodesic equations analytically and numerically in Eddington-Finkelstein-like coordinates, obtaining mutually consistent results that correct and extend previously available formulae.

We establish a direct connection between these orbits and the spacetime fundamental structure, and demonstrate their stability against synchrotron radiation. We show that charged particles such as electrons and protons can exhibit O(1) latitude deviations at the ISCO radius and remain stable under synchrotron emission even for extremely small values of the black hole magnetic charge. We then extend the analysis to rotating MBHs, numerically computing the prograde and retrograde orbital branches and demonstrating how frame-dragging modifies their structure and stability regions. We show that these off-equatorial orbits are a unique feature of the magnetic charge, being forbidden in the analogous electrically charged Kerr-Newman spacetime.

In the presence of such a non-metricity, the length of vectors is preserved under autoparallel transport. We obtain the field equations assuming a vanishing total scalar curvature, implemented by a Lagrange multiplier, and investigate their cosmological implications. To do this, we derive the generalized Friedmann equations which now have terms involving the non-metricity and the Lagrange multiplier. Then, we consider two distinct cosmological applications of the model. First of all, by adopting distinct forms of these two basic variables and investigate the possibility of the existence of warm inflationary scenarios within the framework of these models. In particular, we consider the case that the non-metricity is described by a constant vector, and we show that with this assumption we recover standard general relativity. The scenario in which the Lagrange multiplier is a constant is also investigated, and we show that radiation can be created during the very early phases of expansion. The amount of radiation peaks at a certain time after which, there is a transition from an accelerating inflationary phase to a decelerating one. Moreover, we perform a detailed comparison of the predictions of the considered Schrödinger type cosmology with a set of observational data for the Hubble function, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, by adopting a simple linear form for the Lagrange density.

During the inspiral, the phase evolution is modified by several effects, primarily an additional scalar dipole radiation, which enters at -1PN order. This effect accelerates the inspiral when compared to general relativity, when including corrections up to 2PN. Using fully non-linear numerical simulations of quasi-circular, comparable mass binaries, we find that in the late stages the orbital dynamics are altered so that the overall effect is instead a decelerated merger phase for the modified gravity case. We attribute this to a change in the conservative dynamics, and show that at the late inspiral stage more energy must be emitted in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to induce a given change in frequency. In longer signals, this should lead to a distinctive switch between a faster and slower frequency evolution relative to general relativity as the binary approaches merger. This work suggests we should revisit existing constraints on the theory that are obtained assuming PN approximations apply up to merger, or based on order by order approximations that neglect backreaction effects on the metric, and shows the importance of including non-linear effects that modify the gravitational sector in the strong field regime.",

We obtain that positive self-interaction terms increase the maximum mass and compactness of E-FLS stars, allowing them to reach masses comparable to the Chandrasekhar limit without the need of ultralight bosonic masses. Moreover, in the limit where the real scalar field becomes massless, the solutions present larger effective radii and allow a broader range of stable solutions. Astrophysical images, generated via backward ray-tracing, show that these compact, self-interacting E-FLS stars produce strong gravitational lensing, yielding shadows that could visually mimic black holes, thus providing potential observational signatures detectable in ongoing electromagnetic surveys.",

D 112, 104071 (2025) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The PE for GW merger events relies on a waveform model calibrated using numerical simulations. Within the Bayesian framework, this waveform model represents the GW signal produced during the merger and is crucial for estimating the likelihood function. However, these waveform models may possess systematic errors that can differ across the parameter space. Addressing these errors in the current data analysis pipeline is an active area of research. We introduce parametrizations for the uncertainties in the amplitude and phase of the reference waveform model. When the error budget in the amplitude and phase of the waveform model, as a function of frequency, is known, it can be used as a prior distribution in the Bayesian framework. We also show that conservative priors can be used to quantify uncertainties in waveform modeling without any knowledge of waveform uncertainty error budgets. Through zero-noise injections and PE recoveries, we demonstrate that even 1%-2% of errors in relative phase to the actual waveform model, for a GW150914-like signal and advanced LIGO detector sensitivity, can introduce biases in the recovered parameters. These biases can be corrected when we account for waveform uncertainties within the PE framework. By analyzing a series of simulated signals from mergers with precessing orbits and recovering them using a non-spinning waveform model, we demonstrate that we can reduce the ratio of systematic errors to statistical errors. This approach allows us to address scenarios where specific physical effects are missing in waveform modeling. The code that implements our parametrization for performing PE is available as a Python package \"pycbc_wferrors_plugin\", compatible with the PyCBC open source GW analysis library.",

Several references added General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Gravitational wave (GW) data from observed binary black hole coalescences (BBHC) have been demonstrated in recent analyses to validate the Hawking Area Theorem (HAT) for black hole horizons. The result of such analyses is imposed here as a criterion of {\\it absolute} consistency on the logarithmic (in horizon area) corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking Area Formula (BHAF) for the black hole entropy, when these corrections are computed both from non-perturbative quantum fluctuations of spacetime in matter-free quantum general relativity, as well as arising due to perturbative quantum matter field fluctuations around a stationary classical black hole background spacetime. This criterion of absolute consistency is seen to be obeyed provided certain restrictions ensue on the spin-parity and number of species of the spectrum of quantum matter fluctuations. Such constraints appear to restrict the Beyond-Standard-Model (BSM) part of the matter fluctuation spectrum. Some species of the constrained, yet-unobserved BSM particle spectrum are currently under active consideration in particle cosmology as candidates for dark matter.",

D 112, 104054 (2025) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this work, we study the excitation of a compact star under the influence of external gravitational driving in the relativistic regime. Using a model setup in which a wave with constant frequency is injected from past null infinity and scattered by the star to future null infinity, we show that the scattering coefficient encodes rich information of the star. For example, the analytical structure of the scattering coefficient implies that the decay rate of a mode generally plays the role of ``star excitation factor'', similar to the ``black hole excitation factor'' previously defined for describing black hole mode excitations. With this star excitation factor we derive the transient mode excitation as a binary system crosses a generic mode resonance of a companion star during the inspiral stage. This application is useful because previous description of resonant mode excitation of stars still relies on the mode and driving force decomposition based on the Newtonian formalism. In addition, we show that the scattering phase is intimately related to the total energy of spacetime and matter under the driving of a steady input wave from infinity. We also derive the relevant tidal energy of a star under steady driving and compare that with the dynamic tide formula. We estimate that the difference may lead to $\\mathcal{O}(0.5)$ radian phase modulation in the late stage of the binary neutron star inspiral waveform.",

Version accepted for publication in PRD General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Ultralight bosonic fields around a rotating black hole can extract energy and angular momentum through the superradiant instability and form a dense cloud. We investigate the scenario involving two scalar fields, $\\phi$ and $\\chi$, with a coupling term $\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda\\phi\\chi^2$, which is motivated by the multiple-axion framework. The ultralight scalar $\\phi$ forms a cloud that efficiently produces $\\chi$ particles nonperturbatively via parametric resonance, with a large mass hierarchy, $\\mu_\\chi \\gg \\mu_\\phi$. Rather than escaping the system as investigated by previous studies, these $\\chi$ particles remain bound, orbiting the black hole. Moreover, the particle production occurs primarily at the peak of the cloud's profile, allowing $\\chi$ particles in quasicircular orbits to pass repeatedly through resonant regions, leading to cumulative amplification. This selective process naturally forms a dense ring of $\\chi$ particles, with a mass ratio to the cloud fixed by $(\\mu_\\phi/\\mu_\\chi)^2$. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism for generating bound-state particles via parametric resonance, which also impacts the evolution of the cloud. This process can be probed through its imprint on binary dynamics and its gravitational-wave signatures.",

Geometrically, we employ the hyperboloidal framework to explicitly implement Geroch's rigorous limiting procedures for families of spacetimes. This enables a controlled transition between Schwarzschild, de Sitter, and Nariai geometries. Numerically, we introduce the analytical mesh refinement technique into quasinormal mode calculations, successfully recovering -- within the appropriate limiting scenarios -- both known families of quasinormal modes: complex light ring modes and purely imaginary de Sitter modes. We interpret these results in terms of spectral instability, where the notions of stable and unstable modes depends on the specific spacetime limit under consideration. In the Schwarzschild limit, de Sitter modes appear as a destabilizing effect on the continuous branch cut at $\\omega = 0$. Conversely, the branch cut can be understood as emerging from an infinite accumulation of discrete modes at $\\omega = 0$ in the transitional regime. We propose a heuristic measure of QNM density to characterize this accumulation and highlight the need for a more rigorous study of potential branch cut instabilities -- especially relevant in the context of late-time gravitational wave signals. The proposed infrastructure provides a general and extensible framework for investigations in more complex spacetimes, such as Reissner--Nordström--de Sitter or Kerr--Newman--de Sitter.",

These models allow black holes to exist while having regulators that are larger than the horizon scale; it has been shown previously that this can lead to observable consequences in an astrophysical setting, for allowed choices for the regulator scale. Noting that substantial horizon-scale modifications of the metric will affect black hole thermodynamics and Hawking radiation, we study these metrics in the context of primordial black hole dark matter. Considering examples with de\\,Sitter and Minkowski cores, respectively, we study the effect of the regulator in these metrics on the allowed black hole mass ranges (or ``bands\"), the black hole temperature, specific heat and lifetime, and the bounds on the primordial black hole fraction of the total dark matter density from the observed extragalactic gamma ray background.",

We employ this general thermodynamic criterion to derive a set of inequalities that any superfluid mixture (with an arbitrary number of order parameters) must satisfy for a certain state of motion to be long-lived and unimpeded by friction. These macroscopic constraints complement Landau's original criterion, in that they hold at all temperatures, and remain valid even for gapless superfluids. Unfortunately, they are only necessary conditions for the existence of a frictionless hydrodynamic motion, since they presuppose the validity of a fluid description. However, they do provide sufficient conditions for stability against stochastic hydrodynamic fluctuations.

The complex scalar field \\psi evolves with time t, and its magnitude on the apparent horizon |\\psi_{h}| starts from zero, undergoes a sharp rise followed by rapid oscillations, and eventually converges to a constant value. The variation in the photon sphere radius r_{ps} is similar to that of the magnitude |\\psi_{h}|. Owing to the emergence of the complex scalar hair \\psi, the apparent horizon radius r_{h} starts increasing sharply and then smoothly approaches a stable value eventually. The shadow radius R_{sh} of the black hole with an accretion disk increases with time t_{o} at the observer's position. In the absence of an accretion disk, the shadow radius R_{sh} is larger and also increases as t_{o} increases. Furthermore, we slice the dynamical spacetime into spacelike hypersurfaces for all time points t. For the case with an accretion disk, the variation in R_{sh} is similar to that in the apparent horizon r_{h}, because the inner edge of the accretion disk extends to the apparent horizon. In the absence of an accretion disk, the variation in R_{sh} is similar to that in the photon sphere radius r_{ps}, because the black hole shadow boundary is determined by the photon sphere. As the variation in r_{ps} is induced by \\psi, it can be stated that the variation in the size of the shadow is similarly caused by the change in \\psi. Regardless of the presence or absence of the accretion disk, the emergence of the complex scalar hair \\psi causes the radius R_{sh} of the shadow to start changing. Moreover, we investigate the time delay \\Delta t of lights propagating from light sources to the observer. These findings not only enrich the theoretical models of dynamic black hole shadows but also provide a foundation for testing black hole spacetime dynamics.",

While quantum features of these states such as sub-Poissonian statistics or entanglement could in principle be measured at interferometric detectors, the tiny coupling of gravity to matter makes this extremely challenging.

In Einstein Cartan theory, torsion is embedded in the spacetime by adding an antisymmetric part in affine connection . We consider generalized version of the framework as $f(\\bar{R})$, $\\bar{R}$ being the scalar of the modified curvature tensor. $f(\\bar{R})$ gravity is recast in Einstein frame as non-minimally coupled scalar tensor theory where the scalar field gets coupled with a rank 2 antisymmetric torsion field through derivative couplings. We investigate whether the introduction of three additional torsion-dependent terms in Einstein frame help to realize a bounce. We first explore this cosmological system in the background of a homogeneous and isotropic FRW spacetime but inclusion of the torsion terms are insufficient to produce a bounce in this symmetric setting. Motivated by this limitation, we relax the symmetry and generalize the background to include inhomogeneity and anisotropy. In this setup, the dynamics is modified in such a way that a bouncing solution is possible without invoking phantom fields or energy condition violations. We have found the exact solutions of all the fields and reconstructed the modified gravity form. We have addressed the behaviour of the fields under perturbation and investigated the stability of the solutions.

We review the relevant evidence and argue that the fate of an extended test body is less clear. More precisely: we consider expanding McVittie spacetimes with a non-negative cosmological constant. In each member of this class, we identify a region of the spacetime such that an observer following an initially-ingoing timelike geodesic crosses the black hole horizon of the spacetime in a finite amount of proper time. The curvature behaves in interesting ways along these geodesics. In the case of a positive cosmological constant, curvature scalars (of zero, first and second order in derivatives), Jacobi fields and parallel propagated (p.p.) frame components of the curvature remain finite along timelike geodesics running into the black hole horizon. For a vanishing cosmological constant, scalar curvature terms of zero and first order as well as Jacobi fields remain finite in this limit. However, scalar curvature terms of second order diverge, and we show that there are p.p.\\ frame components of the curvature tensor that also diverge in this limit.

In particular, we show that the set of well-behaved scale-dependent gravity theories can be fully embedded into scalar-tensor theories in a unique way. Conversely, there are multiple ways to write a scalar-tensor theory as a scale-dependent theory. This equivalence is established both on the level of the actions and on the level of field equations. We find that, in the context of this equivalence, the scale-setting relation $k(x)$ is naturally promoted to a dynamical field, which is made manifest by including a corresponding kinetic term in the scale-dependent action. In addition, we demonstrate that the new equivalence fits well into the framework of existing equivalences involving the aforementioned theories and $f(R)$-gravity. Finally, we apply the equivalence relations to explicit examples from both scale-dependent gravity and scalar-tensor theories.",

      "abstract": "Regularized Black Hole Solution from a New String Cloud Source C. R. Muniz, Jonathan Alves Rebouças, Leonardo Tavares de Oliveira, Francisco Tiago Barboza Sampaio, Francisco Bento Lustosa General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We construct a new family of regular black hole solutions supported by the novel Letelier-Alencar string cloud and regularized through a rational Dagum-type distribution. The regulator smooths the matter profile and ensures finite curvature invariants, yielding a geometry that interpolates between a string-cloud exterior and an anti--de Sitter core. We analyze the energy conditions, identifying where the null, weak, dominant and strong conditions hold or fail across the core and exterior. The parameter space for horizon formation is mapped and the thermodynamic propertie -- mass, Hawking temperature, entropy and heat capacity -- are derived; notably, the entropy depends only on the regularization scale while the string parameter modifies temperature and heat capacity. Employing Rényi non-extensive entropy and the topological thermodynamics approach, we show the non-extensive deformation stabilizes the system and removes the standard phase transition. Finally, we compute the shadow radius and derive constraints compatible with current Event Horizon Telescope bounds for Sgr~A* and M87*.",

Senjaya, (Eq. 3), is indeed consistent with the corrected (typo-free) density General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In a recent article, the author of Ref. [EPJC 85 (2025) 1256] constructed an exact solution describing a static, spherically symmetric black hole embedded in a Dehnen-($\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$) type dark matter halo with the parameter choice $\\alpha=1,\\,\\beta=4,\\,\\gamma=1/2$. The author first derived the density profile, which was subsequently integrated to obtain the mass profile, and this mass profile was then employed in constructing the exact metric solution. In this comment, we demonstrate that both the density profile and the mass profile obtained in Ref. [EPJC 85 (2025) 1256] contain fundamental mathematical errors that invalidate the subsequent analysis.",

      "abstract": "Feynman Diagrams for Matter Wave Interferometry Jonah Glick, Tim Kovachy Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph) We introduce a new theoretical framework based on Feynman diagrams to compute phase shifts in matter wave interferometry. The method allows for analytic computation of higher order quantum corrections, beyond the traditional semi-classical approximation. These additional terms depend on the finite size of the initial matter wavefunction and/or have higher order dependence on $\\hbar$. We apply the method to compute the response of matter wave interferometers to power law potentials and potentials with an arbitrary spatial dependence. The analytic expressions are validated by comparing to numerical simulations, and estimates are provided for the scale of the quantum corrections to the phase shift response to the gravitational field of the earth, anharmonic trapping potentials, and gravitational fields from local proof masses. We find that for certain experimentally feasible parameters, these corrections are large enough to be measured, and could lead to systematic errors if not accounted for. We anticipate these corrections will be especially important for trapped matter wave interferometers and for free-space matter wave interferometers in the presence of proof masses. These interferometers are becoming increasingly sensitive tools for mobile inertial sensing, gravity surveying, tests of gravity and its interplay with quantum mechanics, and searches for dark energy.",

Mishra 18 pages, 29 figures. New version matches MNRAS's accepted manuscript General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) We investigate the properties of neutron stars within the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity by incorporating rotational effects through a slowly rotating metric. We derive the modified TOV equations and calculate the angular velocity profiles and moments of inertia (MOI) for linear, quadratic, exponential, and logarithmic $f(Q)$ models. Our results show that deviations in the MOI are more pronounced than those in the stellar mass profiles, suggesting that rotational observables are highly sensitive to geometric corrections. We also calculate a quasi-universal relation between the dimensionless MOI and compactness ($\\bar{I}$-$C$). The linear and quadratic models are generally consistent with observational data from PSR J0737-3039A, although the deviations are small and difficult to distinguish from General Relativity due to inherent EoS variability. On other hand, the logarithmic and exponential models show larger deviations (over 20 %), exceeding the EoS-induced uncertainty reported by Suleiman & Read (2024), highlighting the relation's sensitivity to the $f(Q)$ gravity model. These results indicate that $f(Q)$ gravity could potentially be tested in the strong-field regime and point to a direction for future studies, such as investigating EoS-insensitive quasi-universal relations, like the $\\bar{I}(\\Lambda)$ relations, within the $f(Q)$ framework. Such relations may provide a clearer pathway for exploring possible signatures in strong-field gravity when combined with more precise future observations.",
