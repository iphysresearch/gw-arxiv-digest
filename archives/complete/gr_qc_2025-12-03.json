By deriving the event horizon from the lapse function, we demonstrate that both the string cloud parameter and the electromagnetic background parameter significantly modify the horizon radius compared to the Schwarzschild case. Consequently, thermodynamic quantities-including the Hawking temperature, Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and heat capacity-become explicit functions of these additional parameters, with the heat capacity exhibiting divergences that signal phase transitions. We analyze the motion of massive test particles in this spacetime, deriving the effective potential and calculating the innermost stable circular orbit radius, which governs the inner edge of accretion disks and influences orbital stability. Scalar perturbations are examined through the associated effective potential, and quasinormal mode frequencies are computed using the sixth-order WKB approximation; the negative imaginary parts confirm the stability of the black hole under such perturbations. We also study the photon sphere structure, black hole shadow radius, and photon trajectories, showing how the interplay between string clouds and the electromagnetic background shapes the optical properties of this spacetime. Finally, we investigate weak gravitational lensing phenomena by deriving the deflection angle for both massive particles and photons using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem applied to the optical geometry. The results exhibit notable deviations from the Schwarzschild geometry, with the string cloud enhancing the deflection through a $(1-\\alpha)^{-1}$ factor while the electromagnetic parameter introduces competing corrections at second order.",

The parameter space regions that satisfy the energy extraction condition, as well as the efficiency and power of the extracted energy, are analyzed. The study shows that the presence of a negative cosmological constant extends the range of dominant reconnection radial locations where the energy extraction condition is met, and enables energy extraction even from black holes with relatively low spin. Furthermore, the influence of the negative cosmological constant on energy extraction is modulated by the extent of the dominant reconnection radial region: a more negative cosmological constant enhances the extracted energy, efficiency, and power, particularly for smaller dominant reconnection radii. These results demonstrate that the energy extraction from Kerr-AdS black holes is more favorable than that from their asymptotically flat counterparts. Our results highlight the crucial role of the cosmological constant in energy extraction via magnetic reconnection.",

We derive the gravitational radiation-reaction force for nonspinning eccentric orbits within the effective-one-body (EOB) description for the massless scalar-tensor theories up to 1.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order. The effects in such theories start at $1/c^3$ and interestingly, the 1.5PN order effect is due to the radiation reaction square effects which is a conservative effect. The results derived here can be implemented in the quasi-circular EOB-based waveform models to construct waveform templates for generic orbit binaries within massless scalar-tensor theories of gravity.",

In addition to the well-known asymptotic quantities such as the Bondi-Sachs energy-momentum, the BMS charges and NP constants of this spacetime are computed. Explicit calculations of the latter are relatively scarce in the literature. Moreover, it has been proven that the NP constants of asymptotically flat, stationary, vacuum, and algebraically special spacetimes vanish (for instance, those of the Kerr spacetime). A by-product of the present analysis is to show that the algebraically special condition in the aforementioned result appears to be crucial, since the q-metric provides a counterexample to the conjecture that all asymptotically flat, stationary, vacuum, and asymptotically algebraically special spacetimes (a weaker version of the algebraically special condition) have vanishing NP constants.",

To assess the impact of scalar hair on accretion-flow imaging self-consistently, we construct an analytical model of a geometrically thick, magnetized disk around a rotating hairy black hole in Horndeski theory and analyze its 230 GHz image morphology. We find that scalar hair modestly alters the inflow and magnetic-field structure but strengthens gravitational redshift, markedly reducing the total flux and lensed ring brightness through relativistic transfer and spectral-shift effects. Moreover, we highlight a previously unexplored channel: the maximum interferometric diameter of the first photon ring responds strongly to the hair parameter but shows little dependence on accretion-flow details, making it a promising observable for constraining black-hole hair with future space-based interferometry.",

Its dynamics is studied in both dust-only and scalar-field scenarios, and compared with that of two other non-singular models as well as the classical standard cosmology. The results show that, although all three non-singular cosmologies share identical late-time behavior and allow for a natural embedding of inflation in the scalar-field setting, they exhibit qualitatively distinct non-singular features at very early times. In particular, the new cosmology approaches Minkowski spacetime in the limits of both the infinite past and the infinite future, thereby manifesting an intriguing symmetry between the two asymptotic regimes.",

Duque General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Fermions are coupled to the Einstein-Cartan system in the canonical formulation, including the cosmological, the Barbero-Immirzi, and the non-minimal coupling constants. The resulting ten first-class constraints generate gauge transformations that are on-shell equivalent to spacetime diffeomorphisms and SL(2,C) transformations. The gravitational second-class constraints receive fermionic contributions, which can be implemented by use of Dirac brackets or by solving them directly. Furthermore, we identify new fermionic (second-class) constraints that are necessary to recover the Dirac-fermion theory by relating the momenta to the configuration variables on dynamical solutions; this fermionic phase-space reduction is accomplished by use of corresponding Dirac brackets. The theory remains well-defined off the second-class constraint surfaces with ten additional degrees of freedom - six of which are gravitational and the remaining four are fermionic. Discrete (CPT) symmetries as well as implications for canonical quantization and modified theories of gravity with fermions are discussed.",

Perez Teruel General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Modified dispersion relations (MDRs) arise in many quantum-gravity approaches, often in non-polynomial or non-analytic form beyond the reach of effective field theory (EFT). Logarithmic, exponential and trigonometric MDRs appear in causal set theory, nonlocal gravity and $\\kappa$-Poincaré models, while Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) yields polymeric (sine), holonomy, inverse-triad and semiclassical corrections. Using the geometric framework of Ref.~\\cite{GRP}, we analyse the intrinsic curvature of the associated energy--momentum surfaces, where negative curvature ensures hyperbolic and stable propagation, and curvature sign changes or critical points indicate kinematical instabilities or new invariant scales. We apply this method exhaustively to all major MDRs derived in LQG and find that they remain strictly hyperbolic in the entire phenomenologically relevant regime, with no elliptic patches or critical branching. The same framework provides universal constraints on representative logarithmic, exponential and trigonometric MDRs beyond EFT. Thus, geometric criteria yield a unified and coordinate-independent assessment of stability, thresholds and invariant scales, and demonstrate the robustness of MDRs emerging from LQG.",

We compute these ratios for the general case when the QQNM is not one of the linear QNMs, for the $(l,m)$ channel $(2,2) \\times (2,2) \\to (4,4)$. We find an excellent match with numerical simulations. We also discuss where and why the method can fail, for example, for the channel $(2,0) \\times (2,0) \\to (2,0)$ where we can only get crude estimates for the nonlinearity ratio. Motivated by recent studies on nonlinear ringdown at the horizon, we also compute the nonlinearity ratios at the horizon. We find that the ratio both at the horizon and infinity is insensitive to different choices of regularization of the source term in the second order perturbations. We also discuss amplitudes of QQNMs sourced by linear overtones. Finally, we discuss the issues that must be resolved within this method to do precision analysis of nonlinear ringdown.",

This solution describes an asymmetric wormhole connecting two different asymptotically flat spacetimes (two universes) in which there are in general different observed masses and charges. It is shown that, by suitably adjusting the values of free system parameters, at one end of the wormhole, one can obtain the values of the observed mass and charge typical of the Standard Model particles, whereas at the other end of the wormhole these physical quantities acquire the Planck values. Such a configuration incarnates Wheeler's idea of ``mass without mass'' and ``charge without charge'', and can be thought of as a model of a classical charge possessing a spin.",

We impose a general relativistic radiative transfer equation to determine the synchrotron emission from thermal electrons and generate horizon-scale images. In the RIAF-like model, we notice that the corresponding photon ring and central dark region are expanded with the aid of the PFDM parameter $\\eta$, with brightness asymmetries originating at higher inclination angles and closely tied to flow dynamics and emission anisotropy. The fundamental difference between isotropic and anisotropic radiation is that anisotropy introduces vertical distortions in the higher-order images, resulting in an elliptical appearance. For the Hou disk model, the observed images produce narrower rings and dark interiors, while polarization patterns trace the brightness distribution and changes with the variations of the inclination angle and PFDM parameter $\\eta$, which reflects the spacetime signature. All these results indicate that the observed intensity and polarization characteristics in the framework of thick disk models may serve as valuable probes of underlying spacetime geometry and the accretion-dynamics close to the horizon.",

To incorporate the global features of the GCG into this analysis, we employ the McVittie metric, which describes a black hole embedded in an expanding cosmological background. Within this framework, accretion is studied while consistently accounting for the backreaction on the metric components. Using a perturbative approach, we derive an expression for the effective black hole mass and for the evolution of both the black hole and cosmological apparent horizons under accretion. The analysis is performed in two distinct cosmological regimes: first, a matter-dominated era, and subsequently, a de Sitter era. In both cases, it is possible to determine analytically the instant in which accretion begins. For the matter-dominated era, the analytical expression shows that the greater the amount of matter available for accretion, the longer the accretion takes to start.",

We develop a mathematically consistent framework for signature-changing black holes by revisiting the $(2+1)$-dimensional BTZ metric, which undergoes a Lorentzian-to-Euclidean transition at the horizon. We identify and resolve a critical inconsistency in previous regularization schemes concerning second-order distributional terms $\\varepsilon''(r)$, introducing a \\emph{modified Hadamard regularization} that is rigorously defined within distribution theory. This yields a vacuum solution without surface layers or impulsive waves. Geodesic analysis shows that infalling observers require infinite proper time to reach the horizon, and curvature remains finite everywhere. Furthermore, we establish the physical viability of the solution by proving its linear stability, demonstrating consistent quantum scalar field propagation across the horizon, and reinterpreting the $r=0$ singularity as a removable topological boundary. Our work places signature change and the associated \\emph{atemporality} on a solid foundation as a robust mechanism for singularity resolution.",

Using Bondi Sachs expansions, we identify the independent radiative data and derive the effective Bondi mass aspect, whose balance law receives an additional positive definite flux from the vector sector. This leads to modified displacement, spin, and center of mass memory (CM) expressions, where the gravitational contributions retain their General Relativity (GR) form and the vector field enters only through well defined flux terms. We also describe persistent vector memory effects associated with the leading angular vector mode, which are gauge invariant but do not affect the leading tidal observables. The BMS transformations act kinematically as in GR. Tensor vacua remain supertranslation degenerate, whereas the vector vacuum, defined by the vanishing vector field, is nondegenerate. All results reduce continuously to GR when the coupling is removed, isolating the precise channels through which vector curvature interactions modify the infrared dynamics.",

In this work, we develop a formalism to study the geometry of \\textit{general} horizons (i.e. characterized by any $\\mathcal{K}$), based on encoding the zeroth and first transverse derivatives of $\\mathcal{K}$ on null hypersurfaces detached from any ambient spacetime. We introduce the notions of \\textit{$\\mathcal{K}$-tuple} and \\textit{non-isolation tensor}. The former encodes the order zero of $\\mathcal{K}$, while the latter is a symmetric $2$-covariant tensor that codifies the ``degree of isolation\" of a horizon. In particular, the non-isolation tensor vanishes for homothetic, Killing and isolated horizons. As an application we derive a \\textit{generalized near-horizon equation}, i.e., an identity that holds on any horizon (regardless of its topology or whether it contains fixed points), which relates the non-isolation tensor, a certain torsion one-form, and curvature terms. By restricting this equation to a cross-section one can recover the near-horizon equation of isolated horizons and the master equation of multiple Killing horizons. Our formalism allows us to prove two existence theorems for horizons. Specifically, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a non-degenerate totally geodesic horizon with any prescribed non-isolation tensor to be embeddable in a spacetime satisfying any (non-necessarily $\\Lambda$-vacuum) field equations. We treat first the case of arbitrary topology, and then show how the result can be strengthened when the horizon admits a cross-section.",

      "abstract": "Gravitational lensing inside and outside of a marginally unstable photon sphere in a general, static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically-flat spacetime in strong deflection limits Naoki Tsukamoto General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) It is believed that rays bent inside and outside photon spheres could affect partially the black hole shadow images by the Event Horizon Telescope and the rays near photon spheres would be detected by near-future space observations. The features of the rays near the photon spheres in not only black hole spacetimes but also exotic spacetimes would be important since one will need them to exclude black-hole mimickers. The deflection angles of the rays deflected by photon spheres diverge logarithmically and we can treat them by a strong-deflection-limit analysis. The error of the strong-deflection-limit analysis becomes large if antiphoton spheres exist in the spacetimes and the analysis breaks down when the photon spheres and the antiphoton spheres degenerate to form a marginally unstable photon sphere. This is because the deflection angles of the rays bent by the marginally unstable photon sphere diverge in powers. In this paper, we extend Eiroa, Romero, and Torres's method to gravitational lensing of rays inside and outside of the marginally unstable photon sphere in a general, static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically-flat spacetime in strong deflection limits and we apply it to a Reissner-Nordström spacetime and a Hayward spacetime with the marginally unstable photon sphere. We have also confirmed that the deflection angles in the strong deflection limits by the method converge correctly to the deflection angle without approximations, while there are the mismatches of the coefficient of the power-divergent term of the deflection angles of the rays deflected just outside of the marginally unstable photon sphere in a semi-analytic calculation by the author previously.",

Motivated by two guiding principles for single-field perturbations -- the non-deformation of the boundary metric and the vanishing of electromagnetic energy flux at the AdS boundary -- we impose a boundary condition for Reissner-Nordström-AdS (RN-AdS) black holes requiring both the metric and electromagnetic field-strength perturbations to vanish at the AdS boundary, which we term the physical field-vanishing (PFV) condition. Using the formulas for perturbation reconstruction, we translate the PFV condition into boundary conditions on the master functions: Dirichlet-type for odd-parity modes and Robin-type for even-parity modes. With these boundary conditions, we compute the quasinormal frequencies of RN-AdS black holes and identify new spectral features. The PFV prescription introduced here could be applied to other multifield perturbation systems in asymptotically AdS spacetimes.",

Central to these models is the noncommutative parameter, which plays a crucial role in determining stellar properties and enables the exploration of various astrophysical regimes. While pure Planckian effects pose significant challenges for observational detection, our findings suggest that lower energy scales may reveal exotic stellar objects with Earth and Sun-like masses that lack classical counterparts, potentially providing the first experimental evidence of non-classical gravity.

Using ionization estimates for neutral hydrogen, we obtain a new and robust lower bound on the mass of an extremal electrically charged black hole, exceeding $10^{14} M_\\odot$. For magnetic black holes, we compute the Lee-Nair-Weinberg instability and revisit early universe pair creation rates, including singular instantons that substantially enhance production, to demonstrate that the extreme charges required for stability are cosmologically implausible. Finally, we suggest that an extremal Kerr black hole could shed angular momentum via superradiant scattering from the stochastic gravitational wave background.

In the case of a massive entropic environment, the attractor Bunch--Davies vacuum plays a special role: it is the only state that can undergo full recoherence, whereas all excited initial states exhibit persistent loss of purity. To characterize this behavior, we parameterize excited Gaussian initial states by their Bogoliubov coefficients and compute the purity and Rényi-2 entropy of the reduced adiabatic state as information-theoretic indicators of decoherence dynamics. We find that excited states display \\emph{purity-freezing} at a non-zero plateau, where residual quantum correlations persist indefinitely, a qualitative departure from the complete recoherence observed for the Bunch--Davies vacuum.

The embedded geometry can represent a traversable wormhole (TWH), a one-way wormhole (OOWH), or a regular black hole (RBH). The resulting geometry is regular everywhere, eliminating any singularity or local de-Sitter core at the origin and on the brane location, where the regular geometry is given by the SV geometry. The throat of TWHs or OOWHs can extend into the extra dimension. The event horizon of RBH extends along the extra dimension, prompting speculation on the extension of entropy into this dimension. Although the induced geometry is characterized by tension, acting akin to a positive cosmological constant (thus potentially representing empty space), the induced four-dimensional geometry remains regular. There is no need to introduce additional energy sources on the brane to achieve this regularity. Hence, the brane's geometry, which may depict an RBH, TWH, or OWWH, is influenced by the geometric properties of the bulk",

Instead of curvature, the Teleparallel Theory attributes gravity to torsion $T$, which is related to the antysimmetric part of connection, and the Symmetric Teleparallel theory no longer preserves metricity, describing gravity through the non-metricity tensor $Q_{\\alpha\\mu\\nu}\\equiv \\nabla_\\alpha g_{\\mu\\nu}.$ These descriptions give form to what is known as geometrical trinity of gravity. Recently, the extensions of GR have been intensively investigated in order to solve the theoretical impasses which have arisen. In this sense, it is also useful to investigate the extensions of alternative descriptions of gravity, which leads us to the so-called $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ gravities. In this paper, we consider a family of $f(Q)$ models and obtain their corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-{Volkoff} equations applied to {polytropic} stars. Using numerical integration, it is possible to solve a system of differential equations and calculate, among other things, the maximum mass and mass-radius relation allowed.

Comments are welcome! General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this paper, we investigate the strong gravitational lensing effects and optical appearances around a spherically symmetric regular black hole, whose metric is derived from a non-singular collapsing dust ball model in asymptotically safe gravity. In this regular black hole spacetime, we obtain the analytical expression of the light deflection angle via calculating the strong field limit coefficients, and evaluate the lensing observables in strong field regime by supposing the regular black hole as the candidate of $M87^*$ and $SgrA^*$ supermassive black holes, respectively. Then, we study the optical appearances of an optically and geometrically thin spherical accretion around the regular black hole in this framework. Finally, we compare above results and show how much they differ from those obtained in the Schwarzschild black hole spacetime. We expect our results will be useful in the future to distinguish these non-singular black holes from their classical singular counterparts.",

This mechanism is known as the matter creation theory and this replaces the need of dark energy and modified gravity theories. We consider a two-fluid system consisting of a cold dark matter and a second fluid with constant barotropic equation of state. We performed detailed investigations of such cosmologies using the powerful techniques of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems. Considering a wide variety of the creation rates, we examine the phase space analysis of the individual scenario. According to our analyses, these scenarios predict decelerating unstable dark matter (or second fluid) dominated critical points, accelerating attractors dominated either by dark matter or the second fluid, accelerating scaling attractors in which dark matter and the second fluid co-exist. The regime of late-time accelerating expansion can be classified as either quintessence, phantom or driven by a cosmological constant. This huge variety of critical points makes these scenarios phenomenologically rich, and naturally suggests that such scenarios can be viewed as viable and potential alternatives to the mainstream cosmological models.",

Phys. 73, no. 9-10 (2025): e70024 General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The problem of time in canonical quantum gravity remains one of the most significant challenges, primarily due to the \"frozen\" formalism emerging from the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. Within the ADM formalism, we introduce a novel approach in which a scalar field is treated as a stochastic clock. By imposing a divergence-free condition on the scalar momentum, we integrate out quantum gravitational fluctuations and derive an effective noise term via the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. This noise drives dynamic adjustments in spacetime foliations, enabling a Schrodinger-like evolution that preserves diffeomorphism invariance and, upon noise averaging, maintains unitary evolution. Interestingly, by introducing stochastic variations in the foliations, the quantum indeterminacy of the clock recasts time as a diffusive process emerging from quantum fluctuations, where correlations between matter and geometry replace an absolute time parameter. This provides a potential pathway for understanding quantum time evolution while maintaining background independence in canonical quantum gravity.",

The primary focus is on static spherically symmetric solutions. Complementing previous work on black hole solutions, we study the effects on the solutions when the vector field does not lie at the minimum of its potential. We first investigate the flat spacetime limit, which can be viewed as a modified electrostatic model with a nonlinear interaction term. We study the stability of classical solutions generally and in the spherically-symmetric case. We also find that certain potentials, based on hypergeometric functions, yield a Hamiltonian bounded from below for the case of fixed spatial vector magnitude. With gravity, we solve for the spherically-symmetric metric and vector field, for a variety of choices of the potential energy functions, including ones beyond the quadratic potential like the hypergeometric potentials. Special case exact solutions are obtained showing Schwarszchild-Anti de Sitter and Reissner-Nordstrom spacetimes. We employ horizon and asymptotic analytical expansions along with numerical solutions to explore the general case with the vector field away from the potential minimum. We discover interesting features of these solutions including naked singularities, repulsive gravity, and rapidly varying gravitational field near the source.

As a representative parity-violating theory, dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) gravity has attracted significant attention in recent gravitational wave (GW) studies. Numerous works have constrained the dCS theory through GW observations using quasi-circular waveform templates. Since GW parameter estimation depends critically on waveform template accuracy, improved source modeling and waveform construction are essential for tighter constraints on parity-violating gravity. This work explores the dynamics and gravitational radiation from the binary black hole systems with orbital eccentricity and spin precession. By extending the quasi-Keplerian parameterization, we solve the equations of motion including leading-order dCS corrections and precession effects. Furthermore, the conservative sectors of the gravitational and scalar radiation are presented, the corresponding energy and angular momentum loss are calculated, and the orbital decay is also investigated. Notably, because of the non-zero monopole scalar radiation, carrying energy but not angular momentum, the zero-eccentricity orbit is no longer the final stable state of binaries under radiation reaction. This work provides the theoretical foundation for the complete waveform construction in dCS gravity, benefiting the future gravitational parity-symmetry tests.",

We find a perturbative upper bound on scalaron magnitude that matches Planck constraints on inflaton energy density near the pivot scale.

A distributional geometry-based, self-consistent quantum gravity model in which GR emerges from the collapse of a self-gravitating geon, resolving singularities, forbidding time machines, providing a geometric mechanism for inflation and primordial black holes, and offering a resolution of the gravity-related aspects of the measurement problem General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We develop a non-linear distributional renormalisation algebra for Gaussian Quantum Foam, built from sequences of scaled Gaussians on spacelike hypersurfaces of homotopic, globally hyperbolic spacetimes and their distributional limits. The algebra is closed under multiplication and second-order differentiation, with all non-linear operations defined on smooth representatives before taking the limit. Applied to the non-linear scalar-field wave equation for the shift vector, the wave operator converges to a linear combination of the Dirac measure and its second-order derivative, encoding a sharply localised curvature impulse that displaces the vacuum; in the correspondence limit, the equation reduces to the massless Klein-Gordon equation. Classical singularities are replaced by a well-defined distributional structure: the scalar Ricci projection is non-negative on the singular support and converges to a positive linear combination of the Dirac measure and its second-order derivative while away from the support, in the emerging classical spacetime, the strong energy condition is violated on open sets. The trace of the extrinsic curvature, the mean curvature, and the null expansions vanish on the support (no trapped surfaces). For finite values of the sequence index, there exist open neighbourhoods in which both the inward and outward null expansions are strictly negative; thus, locally and in a classical context, trapped surfaces can occur in those regions. The level sets of the global time function, together with their normal, become asymptotically null, yielding a limiting unstable characteristic hypersurface that fixes evolution by null data and forbids any extension into chronology-violating regions. Finally, it is argued that, within this framework, a gravity-induced spontaneous state reduction restores the Equivalence Principle in the emerging classical spacetimes.",

The near-origin behavior of the metric reveals a timelike singularity for electrically charged cases, in contrast to the spacelike singularity found in the uncharged case. We investigate thermodynamic stability in both the grand canonical and canonical ensembles. In the grand canonical ensemble, stability is determined by the positivity of both the Hessian determinant and the temperature. In the canonical ensemble, the sign of the heat capacity governs stability. We identify both first- and second-order phase transitions, including a van der Waals-like behavior characterized by instability at intermediate black hole sizes.

However, conventional calculations encountered two issues: the divergence of the partial-wave series and the divergence of the Poisson spot near the optical axis. These issues hinder the accurate calculation of lensed waveforms and the study of polarization and wave characteristics in the lensing process, especially near the optical axis. This work demonstrates that both divergences stem from the asymptotic expansion of the radial wave function. By computing the scattered wave function at finite radii and avoiding the asymptotic expansion, we naturally obtain convergent results. We compute scalar waves scattered by (1) a weak-gravity body with Newtonian potential and (2) a Schwarzschild BH with Regge-Wheeler potential. In both cases, we analyze the convergence of the partial-wave series and present finite-luminosity diffraction patterns, with a bright Poisson spot. The above calculations are compared with the Kirchhoff diffraction integral in the near-axis regions and give consistent results.

The Simflowny platform generates the code from a high-level specification of the computational system, producing code that runs with either the SAMRAI or AMReX infrastructure. The choice of AMReX enables compilation and execution on GPUs, running an order of magnitude faster than on CPUs at the node level. We validate the code against benchmark tests, reproducing previous results obtained with the SAMRAI infrastructure, and demonstrate its capabilities with simulations of neutron stars employing realistic tabulated equations of state. Resolution studies clearly demonstrate convergence faster than second order in the grid spacing. Scaling tests reveal excellent strong and weak scaling performance when running on GPUs.

This version closely follows the published article General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Herein we shall argue for the utility of \"spacetime geodesy\", a point of view where one delays as long as possible worrying about dynamical equations, in favour of the maximal utilization of both symmetries and geometrical features. This closely parallels Weinberg's distinction between \"cosmography\" and \"cosmology\", wherein maximal utilization of both the symmetries and geometrical features of Friedmann--Lemaitre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) spacetimes is emphasized. This \"spacetime geodesy\" point of view is particularly useful in those situations where, for one reason or another, the dynamical equations of motion are either uncertain or completely unknown. Several specific examples are discussed -- we shall illustrate what can be done by considering the physics implications of demanding spatially isotropic Ricci tensors as a way of automatically implementing the (isotropic) perfect fluid condition, without committing to a specific equation of state. We also consider the structure of the Weyl tensor in spherical symmetry, with and without the (isotropic) perfect fluid condition, and relate this to the notion of \"complexity\".

By constructing exact Bogoliubov transformations between inertial and accelerated mode bases, we analyze the induced excitations and identify a universal power-law decay in the excitation power spectrum and an alternating pattern in particle production. The spectrum's dependence solely on the acceleration, and not on the size of the box or the observer's position, highlights a kinematic universality akin to that seen in horizon thermodynamics. Generalization to time-dependent accelerations reveals a convolution structure for the Bogoliubov coefficients, with resonant oscillations selectively enhancing mode excitations. These results provide new analytical insights into the interplay between acceleration, confinement, and quantum excitations.",

Lütfüoğlu General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We analyze quasinormal modes, grey-body factors, and absorption cross-sections of a massive scalar field in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a Hernquist dark-matter halo. The quasinormal spectrum is obtained through the higher-order WKB method and verified by time-domain evolution, showing consistent results. The field mass increases the oscillation frequency and reduces the damping rate, producing longer-lived modes, while variations in the halo parameters lead to moderate shifts in the spectrum. The grey-body factors reveal a suppression of low-frequency transmission and a displacement of their main features toward higher frequencies, resulting in a corresponding shift in the absorption cross-section.",

Wassegh 8 pages, 10 figures, Independent research General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det) We present a synchronization-free differential observable for one-way inter-satellite laser ranging, designed to suppress first-order Doppler effects without requiring clock synchronization between spacecraft. The observable is constructed from successive pulse-interval differences, which isolate time-varying signatures while eliminating static and slowly varying biases. Applied to GRACE-FO Laser Ranging Interferometer (LRI) Level-1B data over four seasonal epochs in 2019, the method reveals a stable, spectrally narrow modulation at the orbital frequency. The amplitude and phase of the detected signature remain consistent across all datasets, demonstrating a deterministic, mission-internal origin. The detection is independently confirmed through synthetic-signal injection, shuffle-based significance testing, and cross-comparison with K-band ranging data. These results show that the proposed observable provides a sensitive diagnostic for identifying coherent orbital-period systematics that may remain hidden in conventional range-rate analysis. The method offers a pathway toward improved characterization of instrument and dynamical effects in current and future satellite gravity missions.",

Such a regime is currently accessible only through coalescing compact binaries. In this review, we summarize the status of testing GR with GW observations and discuss the lessons learned. We also touch upon the challenges we currently have in testing GR and the potential path forward to detect a credible violation of GR, should one exist in the data.",

Code and simulation data available at this https URL (DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17767216) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We present a complete and robust framework for non-singular bouncing cosmology in a closed universe, where the scalar field space is endowed with a regularized hyperbolic geometry. The field space metric $g^S_{\\chi\\chi} = (1 + e^{-2\\alpha\\phi/M_{\\mathrm{Pl}}})^{-1}$ is rigorously derived from fundamental physical principles: (i) exponential suppression during contraction enabling the bounce mechanism, (ii) asymptotic saturation to unity during inflation preserving perturbative unitarity, and (iii) positive-definiteness ensuring ghost-freedom. We prove that the sigmoid function emerges uniquely as the minimal-complexity solution satisfying these boundary conditions, with deep connections to hyperbolic geometry and cosmological $\\alpha$-attractors. Through comprehensive numerical validation, we demonstrate that the model achieves 60+ e-folds of inflation following a non-singular bounce without violating the Null Energy Condition. The sigmoid regularization expands the basin of attraction by $\\sim 10^{21}$ compared to the pure exponential metric, achieving 100\\% success rate across 16 orders of magnitude in initial velocities. The perturbation equations remain regular throughout the bounce, and the comoving curvature perturbation $\\mathcal{R}$ is conserved on super-Hubble scales. Observable predictions include spectral index $n_s \\approx 0.967$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \\approx 0.003$, in excellent agreement with Planck 2018 data and testable by next-generation CMB experiments.",

This spacetime explicitly reveals its global causal structure and trapping horizons, leading to the establishment of three possible fates: those without a globally trapped future; those without global trapping but containing bounded, Cauchy-foliated trapped regions; and those with a future that becomes completely globally trapped. This framework is illustrated through the evolution of a geometrically Schwarzschild-like black hole and a horizonless wormhole, thereby establishing the final, globally trapped fate as a novel theoretical possibility.",

By extending semiclassical wave packet theory to incorporate nonadiabatic effects, we introduce a momentum-space metric tensor -- the nonadiabatic metric. This metric gives rise to two velocity corrections, dubbed geometric and geodesic velocities, providing a unified and intuitive framework for understanding nonlinear and nonadiabatic transport phenomena beyond Berry phase effects. Furthermore, we show that the nonadiabatic metric endows momentum space with a curved geometry, recasting wave packet dynamics as forced geodesic motion. In this picture, the metric defines distances, the Berry connection acts as a gauge potential, band dispersion serves as a scalar potential, and the toroidal topology of the Brillouin zone imposes periodic boundary conditions. When the nonadiabatic metric is constant, it reduces to an effective mass, allowing electrons to behave as massive particles in flat bands. In a flat Chern band with harmonic attractive interactions, the two-body wave functions mirror the Landau-level wave functions on a torus.",
