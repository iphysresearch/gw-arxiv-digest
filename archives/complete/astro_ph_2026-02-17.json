Submitted to ApJ. Reproducibility package for data and figures at this https URL. Comments are welcome! High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The catalog of Gravitational Wave (GW) events is rapidly growing, providing key insights into the evolution of massive binaries and compact object formation. However, a key challenge is to explain the origin of exceptional events such as GW190814, among the most asymmetric mass-ratio mergers to date ($q\\approx 0.1$). We show that it shares an evolutionary pathway with the most unequal mass Galactic High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) 4U 1700-37/ HD 153919. We demonstrate this unique connection by utilizing a rich set of existing observational constraints for the HMXB and compute detailed binary evolution models to explain its formation history. We find that conservative mass transfer, along with a directed natal kick are essential to explain its current state. We show that this system is unlikely to form a GW source due to a failed Common Envelope (CE) phase in the future, in agreement with previous work. With additional models, we show that a similar pathway naturally forms GW190814-like events, provided the first phase of mass transfer remains conservative, and the first-born (lower mass) compact object receives a large natal kick ($\\gtrsim 100\\,\\mathrm{km/s}$) for the subsequent CE phase to be successful and form a asymmetric mass-ratio GW source. Anchored by the number of analogous Galactic HMXBs, we estimate rates for such GW events, which broadly agree with their observed rate. Our work demonstrates a unified formation pathway for highly asymmetric mass-ratio HMXBs and GW events. Moreover, it highlights the critical role of finding and characterizing local analogs in different evolutionary phases, and using them as a bridge to understand the origin of GW sources, especially the outliers like GW190814.",

However, standard analyses typically rely on \\emph{ad hoc} hotspot parameterizations rather than self-consistent physical models. While connecting surface heating directly to the magnetospheric geometry provides a more natural physical pathway, computing global magnetospheric solutions is too computationally expensive to perform on-the-fly during parameter inference. In this work, we bridge this gap by deriving fully analytic, first-principles expressions for surface return currents in mixed dipole--quadrupole magnetospheres. Working within force-free electrodynamics, we generalize the field-aligned current invariant $\\Lambda$, the crucial scalar that maps the far-zone magnetic structure to the near-zone heating rate, from the standard dipole approximation to arbitrary quadrupolar configurations. We demonstrate that even when the quadrupole component is sub-dominant in the far zone (the mixing regime), using a dipole-based heating prescription fails to capture the significant enhancement or suppression of the return-current density on the polar cap. Our consistent quadrupole-aware framework reveals that these multipolar currents redistribute the surface heating, leading to systematic discrepancies in predicted pulse profiles that are amplified by atmosphere beaming and can reach $\\sim 30\\%$ near pulse peaks. These results provide a rigorous analytic foundation for mapping global magnetic geometry to surface heating in multipolar magnetospheres, enabling physically consistent inference beyond the idealized dipole approximation.",

Accepted for publication in Physical Review D High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Fermi LAT observations of gamma-ray pulsars can be used to build a pulsar timing array (PTA) experiment to search for gravitational wave (GW) signals at nanohertz frequencies. At those frequencies, the dominant signal is expected to be a stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) produced by the incoherent superposition of the quasi-monochromatic GW emissions from a population of supermassive black hole binaries. While the radio PTAs have recently announced compelling evidence for a GWB signal with a power law spectrum of strain amplitude $\\approx2-3\\times10^{-15}$ (at the frequency of $1 {\\rm yr}^{-1}$), in 2022 an analysis of $12.5$ years of Fermi data for 35 pulsars led to an upper limit of $1\\times10^{-14}$ for the GWB amplitude. The analysis was carried out on times-of-arrival (TOAs) obtained by folding from six months up to one year of photon observations. A photon-by-photon approach was also tested to infer constraints on the GWB amplitude from individual pulsars, but without accounting for the cross-pulsar correlations that a GWB would induce. Here, we reanalyse the same dataset using a regularized likelihood method that correctly models cross-pulsar correlations directly from the photons, while additionally marginalising over the uncertain pulse profile shape. While the two methods are not expected to have significant differences in sensitivity, we prove through simulations of gamma-ray PTA datasets that the photon-by-photon method for GWB recoveries is, statistically, more robust. The resulting upper limit obtained for the GWB strain amplitude is $1.2\\times10^{-14}$, indicating that the improved method yields a consistent result with the previous analyses.",

Parameterizations of this kind place observers in a privileged position-specifically on the plane that divides the two hemispheres. To quantify potential deviations from the cosmological principle without presuming a special location, we develop a stochastic framework that parametrizes departures from statistical homogeneity and isotropy. The near-uniform temperature of the cosmic microwave background indicates that anisotropy is negligible (at the $\\lesssim 10^{-5}$ level) on the last scattering surface. This serves as a zero boundary condition, enabling the construction of an orthogonal basis of functions below the recombination redshift. Within this basis, we expand the relative deviation from the Hubble diagram of isotropic models (such as $\\Lambda$CDM or $w_0w_a$CDM) in a hierarchy of increasing resolution. Applying this approach, we test the cosmological principle using Type Ia supernovae, strong lensing time delays, and gravitational-wave standard sirens. For the class of large-scale anisotropies and low-order radial variations described by this framework, the current datasets are found to be consistent with statistical homogeneity and isotropy on gigaparsec scales.",

Matches published version Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Homogeneous and nearly-isotropic cosmological models are natural extensions of standard Friedmann cosmologies. Constraining their features is crucial, as any detection of their properties would impact our understanding of inflation and the cosmological principle. Since these models evolve as a set of non-interacting scalar, vector, and tensor modes on top of homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes, their imprints on cosmological observables, particularly the CMB, can be obtained using standard line-of-sight methods. This requires (1) that one resorts on Laplacian eigenmodes on spatially curved spaces and (2) that radial functions for these modes are analytically continued to accommodate complex (i.e., supercurvature) wavenumbers. We introduce two line-of-sight integrators implementing the evolution of the CMB anisotropies in these models: \\texttt{AniLoS}, a user-friendly and easy to modify \\texttt{Python} package, and \\texttt{AniCLASS}, an advanced and efficient extension of the Boltzmann solver \\texttt{CLASS}. We discuss possible initial conditions that could generate such fluctuations and provide illustrative examples using our codes.

We show that the correlation between Fourier components of pulsar timing residuals can be expressed using transfer functions; that are indicative of characteristic temporal correlations in a SGWB signal observed in a finite time window. These transfer functions, when convolved with the SGWB power spectrum and spatial correlation (Hellings \\& Downs curve), describe the variances and correlations of the pulsar timing residuals' Fourier coefficients. The convolutions are the exact frequency- and Fourier-domain representations of the time-domain covariance function. We derive explicit forms for the transfer functions for unpolarized and circularly polarized SGWB signals. We validate our results by comparing Gaussian theoretical expectation values with standard simulations based on point sources and our own covariance-matrix-based approach. The unified frequency- and Fourier-domain formalism provides a robust foundation for future PTA precision analyses and highlights the importance of temporal correlations in interpreting GW signals.",

What was the actual origin of these two words? There are many aspects hidden under this name, which are seldom explained. They are discussed here. To frame the analysis, help will be sought from the highly authoritative voices of two exceptional writers: William Shakespeare and Umberto Eco. Both have explored the tension existing between words and the realities they name. And this includes names given to outstanding theorems and spectacular discoveries, too. Stigler's law of eponymy is recalled in this context. These points will be at the heart of the quest here, concerning the concept of ``Big Bang\", which only a few people know what it means, actually. Fred Hoyle was the first to pronounce these words, in a BBC radio program, with a meaning that was later called inflation. But listeners were left with the image he was trying to destroy: the explosion of Lemaître's primeval atom (an absolutely wrong concept). Hoyle's Steady State will be carefully compared with inflation cosmology. They are quite different, and yet, in both cases, the possibility of creating matter/energy out of expanding space is rooted in the same fundamental principles: those of General Relativity. As is also, the possibility of having a universe with zero total energy, anticipated by R.C. Tolman, in 1934 already. It will be shown, how to obtain accelerated expansion from negative pressure; how to reconcile energy conservation with matter creation in an expanding universe; and a curious relation between de Sitter spacetime and Steady State cosmology. Concerning the naming issue, it will be remarked that, today, the same label ``Big Bang\" is used in very different contexts: (a) the Big Bang Singularity; (b) as the equivalent of cosmic inflation; (c) speaking of the Big Bang cosmological model; (d) to name a very popular TV program; and more.",

This work uses for the first time a closed-loop, non-linear, and time-varying dynamics implementation to simulate detailed angular jitters for the spacecraft and optical benches. In turn, this gives an improved expectation of the TTL contribution to the interferometric output. It is shown that the TTL coupling impact is limited given current estimates on the size of coupling coefficients. A time-domain Least Squares estimator is used to infer the TTL parameters from the simulated measurements. The bias and correlations limit the estimator in the case of regular datasets with amplified TTL coefficients to a relative error of $10\\%$, but the subtraction of the TTL signal still works well. For lower readout noises, the estimation error diverges, which can be mitigated using a regularization term. Alternatively, using sinusoidal maneuvers improves the inference to a high accuracy of $0.1\\%$ for TTL coefficients around the expected level, removing all correlations in the inferred parameters. This validates the maneuver design by Wegener et al. (2025) in this closed-loop setting.",

In detail, we incorporated 77,000 HST pixels, in addition to the known 106 point-like multiple images, in our modeling. We considered four different models to explore the effect of the relative weighting of the point-like multiple image positions and flux distribution of the SN host on the model optimization. When the SN host's extended image is included, we find that the statistical uncertainties of all 34 free model parameters are reduced by factors ranging from one to two orders of magnitude compared to the statistical uncertainty of the point-like only model, irrespective of the adopted different image weights. We quantified the remarkably increased level of precision with which the cluster's total mass and the predicted time delays of the SN Refsdal multiple image positions can be reconstructed. We also show the delensed image of the SN host, a spiral galaxy at zSN = 1.49, in multiple HST bands. In all those applications, we obtain a significant reduction of the statistical uncertainty, which is now below the level of even the small systematic uncertainty on the mass model that could be assessed by the different approaches. These results demonstrate that with extended image models of lensing clusters it is possible to measure the cluster's total mass distribution, the values of the cosmological parameters, and the physical properties of high-redshift sources with an unparalleled precision, making the typically not-quantified systematic uncertainties now crucial.",

This cross-covariance is essential for joint analyses that combine full-shape clustering information with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, as commonly performed in modern spectroscopic surveys. Our model builds on the disconnected contribution to the covariance and accounts for the damping of correlations due to the BAO reconstruction process. We validate our analytic prescription against numerical simulations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), testing both idealized cubic geometries and realistic survey configurations including complex footprints and fiber assignment effects. Despite neglecting survey window functions in the analytic calculation, we find excellent agreement with simulation-based covariances and demonstrate that cosmological parameter constraints are virtually unchanged when using our approximation. Our results show that the pre-post cross-covariance is sufficiently small that even approximate treatments are adequate for cosmological inference, opening a pathway toward fully analytic covariance matrices for next-generation galaxy surveys.",

Comments are welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The analysis of the large-scale clustering of quasars (QSO) observed by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) represents a promising avenue for constraining local Primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), parameterized by $f_{\\rm NL}$. The signal to be constrained is the scale-dependent bias induced in the 2-point clustering of the considered tracer sample. The resulting constraints on $f_{\\rm NL}$, however, are fully degenerate with the local PNG bias parameter $b_{\\phi}$, dependent on the assembly bias parameter $p$. Using IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations, we select a QSO sample reflecting the selection criteria and properties of DESI QSOs, and provide a robust prior for $p$, and thus for $b_{\\phi}$, building on the findings of Fondi et al. 2024. We find a distribution with mean $\\bar{p}\\simeq1.4$ with weak redshift dependence, stable to selection noise and consistent with the expected recent merger history typical of quasar-hosting halos. By comparing with the CAMELS simulations we demonstrate that this prior is robust to astrophysical assumptions and cosmic variance. Finally, applying this prior to the DESI DR1 dataset, we derive updated constraints on local PNG, obtaining $f_{\\rm NL}=-3.3\\pm9.2$.",

      "abstract": "On The Stability Of $H_0$ And The Inverse Distance Ladder B. Popovic, M. Sullivan Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The `Inverse Distance Ladder' uses relative-distance measurements with type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), anchored to an absolute distance scale from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and the cosmic microwave background (CMB), to provide an alternative measurement technique for the local expansion rate $H_0$. Using SNe Ia from the Dark Energy Survey and BAO measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, we show that the inverse distance ladder is unable to explain the Hubble Tension, anchored as it is to the CMB and its value of $H_0 = 67.4 \\pm 0.5$ kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. To do so, we first show that the suite of systematics considered in cosmology analyses with SNe Ia only move the inferred $H_0$ by $<0.1$kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, and second, we investigate the scale of redshift-dependent magnitude changes necessary to change the inferred inverse distance ladder $H_0$ from $67$ to the local network of distance measurements value of $73$, and the impact that this would have on other cosmological inferences with SNe Ia. We find that a change of $d\\mu/dz = 0.2$ mag would be necessary to infer an $H_0$ in concordance with local distance measurements, and that this $d\\mu/dz$ value would result in a Flat $\\Lambda$CDM $\\Omega_M = 0.23$, $10\\sigma$ discrepant with other cosmological probes, {indicating that the precision of SNe Ia measurements preclude the necessary redshift evolution for an $H_0$ of 74 kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$}. Therefore, we conclude that current SN Ia cosmology leaves little freedom for the inverse distance ladder to yield $H_0$ values significantly different from $67$ kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.",

Broadband polarimetric observations in the 2-8 GHz range of the gravitationally lensed system CLASS B1152+199 were carried out over five epochs spanning three months with a cadence of roughly 20 days, and the differential birefringence angle ($\\Delta\\,\\theta_{a,{\\rm lens}}$) between the lensed images were estimated. We also combined an archival observation that effectively increases the span to 9.5 yr to probe the effect of an oscillating ALP field imprinted as oscillating ${\\Delta\\,\\theta_{a,{\\rm lens}}}$ over time. Here we present a new technique for combining multi-epoch measurements of ${\\Delta\\,\\theta_{a,{\\rm lens}}}$ by considering the coherence of the ALP field, such that, ${\\Delta\\,\\theta_{a,{\\rm lens}}}$ over these observations are related. The time scale of coherence depends on the mass of the ALP field ($m_a$).

      "abstract": "GAME: Genetic Algorithms with Marginalised Ensembles for model-independent reconstruction of cosmological quantities Matteo Peronaci, Matteo Martinelli, Savvas Nesseris Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Genetic Algorithms (GA) are a powerful tool for stochastic optimisation and non-parametric symbolic regression, already widely used in cosmology. They are capable of reconstructing analytical functions directly from data points without introducing new physical models. A limitation of this approach is that while the reconstructed function is very efficient at reproducing the behaviour of the data points, non-observable quantities involving derivatives are particularly sensitive to stochasticity, hyperparameters, and to the choice of the best-fit function obtained by the GA, which implies the risk of the algorithm getting stuck in a local minimum. In this work we propose an update to the GA methodology for the reconstruction of analytical functions that involves computing a weighted average of an ensemble of GA configurations (\\texttt{GAME}). We define the weights via a quantity that accounts for both the goodness-of-fit of the points and the smoothness of the resulting function. We also present a practical method to analytically estimate and correct the errors on the averaged function by combining a path-integral approach with an ensemble variance. We demonstrate the improvement offered by \\texttt{GAME} methodology on a generic test function. We then apply the new methodology to a non-parametric reconstruction of the Hubble rate $H(z)$ using Cosmic Chronometers data and, assuming a flat Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker background and General Relativity, we infer the corresponding dark energy equation of state $w(z)$. Through consistency tests, we show that current data produces results compatible with $\\Lambda$CDM, and that Stage IV cosmology surveys will allow GA reinforced with \\texttt{GAME} methodology to become an even more competitive tool for discriminating between different models.",

We also indexed the authors' affiliations to put into context the global distribution of research and collaboration. Combining this data with the citation information of each paper allows us to understand how influential different papers have been on the progress of the field this year. Overall, these statistics highlight the general current state of the field, the hot topics people are working on and the different research communities across the globe and how they function.

Palencia Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Based on deep high resolution JWST images of AS1063, and after a careful masking of artifacts, extended features in the cluster, and background galaxies (including known lensed ones), we have identified tens of thousands of unresolved point sources in the central region of the galaxy cluster. We extended the identification of these point sources up to 1.18 Mpc from the center of the cluster using data in the second module. Most of these sources are expected to be globular clusters orbiting in the deep potential well of the cluster, but also the surviving compact cores of satellite galaxies. We study the distribution of the globular clusters and compared it with the distribution of mass from a lens model derived from the same JWST data. We find a very tight correlation between the two distributions, but also some differences, including a more concentrated distribution for the globular clusters than for dark matter. We explored the possibility of using the distribution of globular clusters as a proxy for the lensing mass. We find that a simple smoothing kernel can transform the discrete distribution of point sources into a continuous two-dimensional distribution that matches well the lensing convergence. This suggests that globular clusters can be used as tracers of the dark matter distribution in other massive clusters where gravitational lensing constraints are scarce but globular clusters can be detected more easily, for instance in low redshift galaxy clusters.",

The framework combines primordial non-equilibrium chemistry, metal-line cooling, IMF-sampled stellar evolution with SN feedback, and approximate Lyman-Werner (LW) and ionizing radiation transport. We run a suite of $1c{\\rm Mpc}/h$ box simulations with different initial conditions and resolutions from $z=127$ to $z=10$. The highest gas mass and spatial resolution in the fiducial simulation reach $\\sim10\\,{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ and $\\sim4\\,{\\rm pc}$, respectively. The model successfully reproduces the UV-inferred Pop II star formation rate density (SFRD) from recent JWST observations across all initial conditions, with only minor variation driven by local halo interactions and LW irradiation. We find that the volume filling factor of metal-enriched gas converges to $\\sim1\\%$ at $z=10$. Convergence is achieved once subhalos with $M_{\\rm subhalo}\\gtrsim 10^{6.5}\\,{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ are resolved, and the total stellar mass at $z=10$ is largely insensitive to initial conditions or the resolution considered in this work.

Wang 20 pages, 18 figures, accepted by PASA (11 February 2026), abbreviated abstract Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Spectral-line results from a new cryogenic phased array feed (cryoPAF) on the Murriyang telescope at Parkes are presented. This array offers a significant improvement in field of view, aperture efficiency, bandwidth, chromaticity and survey speed compared with conventional horn-fed receivers. We demonstrate this with measurements of sky calibrators and observations of 21-cm neutral hydrogen (HI) in the LMC and the nearby galaxy NGC 6744. Within 0.3 deg of the optical axis, the ratio of system temperature to dish aperture efficiency is 25 K and the ratio with beam efficiency is 21 K (at 1.4 GHz). For the previously measured $T_{sys} = 17$ K, respective efficiency values 0.7 and 0.8 are derived. Our HI observational results are in good agreement with previous results, although detailed comparison with multibeam observations of the LMC suggests that the earlier observations may have missed an extended component of low-column-density gas ($8\\times 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$). We use the cryoPAF zoom-band and wideband data to make a preliminary investigation of whether the large number of simultaneous beams (72) permits the use of novel data reduction methods to reduce the effects of foreground/background continuum contamination and RFI. We also investigate if these methods can better protect against signal loss for the detection of faint, extended cosmological signals such as HI intensity maps. Using robust higher-order singular value decomposition (SVD) techniques, we find encouraging results for the detection of both compact and extended sources, including challenging conditions with high RFI occupancy and significant sky continuum structure. Examples are shown that demonstrate that 3D SVD techniques offer a significant improvement in noise reduction and signal capture compared with more traditional layered 2D techniques.",

Yang 24 pages, 18 figures, submitted to A&A Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Modern time-domain surveys, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), detect far more extragalactic transients than can be spectroscopically classified. Photometric classification offers a scalable alternative, enabling the identification of larger, fainter, and higher-redshift supernova samples suitable for applications such as Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) cosmology. We present a feature-based photometric classifier for SNe detected by ZTF, with the primary goal of constructing a photometric SN Ia sample for cosmological analyses. Our approach utilises the autoencoder architecture of ParSNIP (Boone 2021) to capture the intrinsic diversity of SN light curves. We trained the model on a spectroscopically classified ZTF SN sample, incorporating a realistic noise augmentation procedure that simulates the flux uncertainties of fainter sources. Light curve features were used to train a gradient-boosted decision tree classifier, implemented in both binary (SN Ia vs. non-Ia) and multi-class configurations. We validated our classifier on independent, fainter ZTF data with and without noise augmentation. To evaluate real-time performance, we also applied our classifier to live ZTF alerts and conducted a spectroscopic classification survey within the ePESSTO+ collaboration. We found that noise augmentation significantly improves classification performance, particularly for fainter sources. Our binary classifier achieves an SN Ia recall of (98.1 $\\pm$ 0.4)%, averaged across five train-test splits. SN Ia recall exceeds 98% for events with a peak apparent magnitude up to 20 and more than 10 detections, and remains above 96% up to magnitude 20.5. Overall, 95% of sources were correctly classified in both binary and multi-class modes. Our classifier performs efficiently on real ZTF data and enables construction of a large photometric SN Ia sample for cosmology.",

A greater flux would be produced by more distant and massive halos, with larger velocity dispersions. We construct full-sky predictions for the gamma-ray emission from galaxy- and cluster-mass halos within $\\sim 200 {\\rm \\, Mpc}$ using a suite of constrained $N$-body simulations ($\\texttt{CSiBORG}$) based on the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies algorithm. Comparing to observations from the Fermi Large Area Telescope and marginalising over reconstruction uncertainties and other astrophysical contributions to the flux, we obtain constraints on the cross-section which are two (seven) orders of magnitude tighter than those obtained from dwarf spheroidals for $p$-wave ($d$-wave) annihilation. We find no evidence for either type of annihilation from dark matter particles with masses in the range $m_\\chi = 2-500{\\rm \\, GeV}/c^2$, for any channel. As an example, for annihilations producing bottom quarks with $m_\\chi = 10 {\\rm \\, GeV}/c^2$, we find $a_{1} < 2.4 \\times 10^{-21} {\\rm \\, cm^3 s^{-1}}$ and $a_{2} < 3.0 \\times 10^{-18} {\\rm \\, cm^3 s^{-1}}$ at 95% confidence, where the product of the cross-section, $\\sigma$, and relative particle velocity, $v$, is given by $\\sigma v = a_\\ell (v/c)^{2\\ell}$ and $\\ell=1, 2$ for $p$-, $d$-wave annihilation, respectively. Our bounds, although failing to exclude the thermal relic cross-section for velocity-dependent annihilation channels, are among the tightest to date.",

The simulation corresponds to a deep (1000 h) integration pointing over the 106 MHz-196 MHz frequency range. The sky components include the CD/EoR signal, extragalactic foreground emission featuring strong (over 5 Jy at 150 MHz) out-of-field sources and in-field sources down to 1 microJy at 150 MHz, and Galactic emission from the GSM2016 model complemented with small-scales structure beyond its native $\\sim 1$ deg resolution from a magneto-hydrodynamic simulation of the interstellar medium. Modeled errors include a partial de-mixing of the out-of-field sources, direction-dependent calibration errors leading to residual ionospheric effects, and direction-independent gain calibration errors, on top of thermal noise. Simulated observations are delivered as visibilities as well as imaging products with natural weighting. The true, uncorrupted, CD/EoR signal is also delivered, to allow an assessment of the efficacy of foreground-mitigation approaches. The codes used to generate these simulations are also delivered, so that new simulated datasets can be produced.

We show that such effects naturally manifest as finite-temperature self-energy corrections to the scalar mass term, leading to an additional contribution of the form \\(c\\,T^{p}\\phi^{2}\\) in the effective potential. In this work, we systematically investigate how these loop-induced, temperature-dependent corrections affect key phase transition parameters, including the nucleation temperature, latent heat release, and inverse duration parameter. These modifications influence both the strength and duration of the phase transition, which in turn determine the properties of the resulting stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background. Employing semi-analytic computational methods, we evaluate the GW spectra generated under these conditions and compare our predictions with the projected sensitivities of forthcoming detectors such as LISA, DECIGO, and BBO. Our analysis demonstrates that finite-temperature scattering effects of this kind can substantially strengthen first-order transitions and produce GW signals that lie within the reach of future observational facilities. The results establish a concrete thermal-field-theoretic origin for temperature-dependent modifications of the scalar potential and emphasize their importance in shaping early-Universe cosmological signatures.",

Betancort-Rijo, Francisco Prada, Tomoaki Ishiyama, Anatoly Klypin, José Ruedas Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present a new theoretical framework for the halo mass function (HMF) that accurately predicts the abundance of dark matter haloes across an exceptionally wide range in mass and redshift. Building on a generalised Press & Schechter model and triaxial collapse (GPS+), we predict the HMF in terms of the variance of the linear density field, with only a weak explicit dependence on halo mass and no explicit dependence on redshift. The GPS+ model naturally provides the correct normalization and high-mass behaviour without requiring empirical fitting. We calibrate and validate the GPS+ model using the Uchuu N-body simulation suite, which combines large cosmological volume and high mass resolution under Planck cosmology. Using six simulations with up to 300 realizations, we obtain precision HMF measurements spanning halo masses in the range 6.5 < log($M_{\\rm 200m}$/[h$^{-1}$ $M_{\\odot}$]) <16 over 0 < z < 20, with reduced cosmic variance. Across this full domain, the GPS+ model reproduces the simulated HMF with deviations typically below 10-20%. Comparison with the Sheth-Tormen (ST) model shows similar performance at z < 2, but markedly improved agreement at higher redshifts, where ST can deviate by 70-80% while our model remains within ~20%. Finally, we assess the impact of the halo mass definition: adopting the evolving virial overdensity of Bryan & Norman (1998) worsens agreement at low redshift and high masses, whereas M200m yields a more universal, nearly redshift-independent HMF.",

Introducing such a localized feature temporarily decelerates the slow-roll inflaton, amplifying the primordial curvature power spectrum into a sharp peak. Consequently, this enhancement sources a significant stochastic background of gravitational waves and leads to abundant formation of primordial black holes. Through eight benchmark cases, we show that the predicted abundances of primordial black holes can remain compatible with current observational limits, while the corresponding gravitational wave spectra peaking across a wide range of frequencies are accessible to future gravitational wave experiments in multiple observational bands.",

Hayes, Suhail Dhawan, Stephen Thorp, Justin D. R. Pierel, Nikki Arendse 31 pages, 14 figures; Published in MNRAS Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The delay in arrival time of the multiple images of gravitationally lensed supernovae (glSNe) can be related to the present-day expansion rate of the universe, $H_{0}$. Despite their rarity, Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (Rubin-LSST) is expected to discover tens of galaxy-scale glSNe per year, many of which will not be resolved due to their compact nature. Follow-up from ground- and space-based telescopes will be necessary to estimate time delays to sufficient precision for meaningful $H_{0}$ constraints. We present the Glimpse model (GausSN Light curve Inference of Magnifications and Phase Shifts, Extended) that estimates time delays with resolved and unresolved observations together for the first time, while simultaneously accounting for dust and microlensing effects. With this method, we explore best follow-up strategies for glSNe observed by Rubin-LSST. For unresolved systems on the dimmest end of detectability by Rubin-LSST, having peak i-band magnitudes of 22-24 mag, the time delays are measured to as low as 0.7 day uncertainty with 6-8 epochs of resolved space-based observations in each of 4-6 optical and NIR filters. For systems of similar brightness that are resolved by ground-based facilities, time delays are consistently constrained to 0.5-0.8 day precision with 6 epochs in 4 optical and NIR filters of space-based observations or 8 epochs in 4 optical filters of deep ground-based observations. This work improves on previous time-delay estimation methods and demonstrates that glSNe time delays of $\\sim10-20$ days can be measured to sufficient precision for competitive $H_{0}$ estimates in the Rubin-LSST era.",

Accepted for publication in MNRAS; in press Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations are essential tools for studying the formation and evolution of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes. While they reproduce many key observed properties of galaxies, their limited volumes have hindered comprehensive studies of the AGN and quasar populations. In this work, we leverage the FLAMINGO simulation suite, focusing on its large $(2.8$ $\\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ volume, to investigate two key observables of quasar activity: the quasar luminosity function (QLF) and quasar clustering. FLAMINGO reproduces the observed QLF at low redshift ($z \\lesssim 1$) and for faint quasars ($L_\\mathrm{bol} \\lesssim 10^{45}$ $\\mathrm{erg s^{-1}}$), but significantly underpredicts the abundance of bright quasars at $z \\approx 1$-$3$. Introducing a 0.75 dex log-normal luminosity scatter to represent unresolved small-scale variability boosts the number of bright quasars by upscattering lower-luminosity systems, thereby improving agreement with observations at the bright end. A decomposition of the QLF by black hole mass reveals that this boost is primarily driven by low-mass black holes radiating above the Eddington limit. Nevertheless, limitations remain in fully reproducing the rise and decline of the bright quasar population over cosmic time and in matching the black hole masses inferred from quasar spectra. Thanks to FLAMINGO's large volume, we can robustly sample rare, luminous quasars and measure their spatial clustering for $\\log_{10} L_\\mathrm{bol}/\\mathrm{erg s^{-1}} \\gtrsim 45.5$. The simulation reproduces the observed clustering across $0 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 3$, and the reduced luminosity dependence introduced by scatter aligns with observational trends. However, it underpredicts the clustering strength at $z \\approx 4$, consistent with other models and possibly reflecting high-redshift observational uncertainties.",

With groundbreaking discoveries ranging from the first detailed images of protoplanetary disks to the kinematics of galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization, ALMA has showcased the vast discovery potential of the (sub-)mm wavelength regime. However, in another 15 years from now--in the 2040s--the science landscape will have changed dramatically as new major observational facilities will have started their operations or have come towards advanced maturity in their scientific outcome (e.g., JWST, Rubin Observatory, ELT, Euclid, Gaia, Plato, Ariel, Roman Space Telescope, SPHEREx, LiteBIRD, LISA, SKA and others). At the same time, ALMA's current Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade will have been in place for ~10 years, and ALMA itself will have been operational for 30 years. To fully exploit this era, the community needs a next-generation facility operating at (sub-)mm wavelengths with capabilities far beyond those possible within ALMA's current infrastructure. To this end, ALMA2040 is a community-driven initiative to define the key scientific questions of the 2040s and translate them into a technical vision for a next-generation transformational (sub-)millimeter facility. Our goal with this document is to summarize the current status of the effort, synthesize outcomes from the 2025 workshops, outline next steps toward a reference design concept, and invite broad participation from the global mm/sub-mm community to help shape this future facility. In the following we provide details on the process and scope. We invite everyone who wishes to join the effort and/or contribute to the dedicated White Papers planned for 2026.",

Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are rare transients that provide important insights into the physics of galactic nuclei. A recently identified feature in their optical light curves is the presence of early bump-like structures (precursors) that appear before the onset of the main flare or during its rise. Aims. We aim to build and study the first sample of precursor TDEs in order to improve our understanding of these features, which could be key to revealing the origin of the optical emission in TDEs. Methods. We compiled all known precursor TDEs from the literature, searched for additional candidates, and analyzed them as a sample. Results. We find that precursor TDEs predominantly fall within the repeating TDE, fast TDE, and TDE in active galactic nucleus (AGN) subclasses. We reveal a positive correlation between the occurrence time of the precursors relative to the main peak and the central black hole mass. Conclusions. We suggest that the precursors appear due to interactions between the incoming stellar debris and the disk or leftover material from an earlier disruption (repeating and fast TDEs) or a stable pre-existing disk (TDEs in AGNs). Precursors are therefore potentially key signatures of repeating partial TDEs in previously quiescent galaxies.",

The mechanism requires strong magnetic fields in the upstream plasma entering the reconnection layer, and weaker, but still substantial, magnetic fields in the downstream regions. In this Letter, we estimate the coronal magnetic fields for three different magnetic energy dissipation mechanisms: plasmoid-dominated magnetic reconnection, fast collisionless reconnection, and magnetic field relaxation. We show that the lack of strong Faraday depolarization constrains viable models and can be used to benchmark numerical accretion flow models. We conclude by discussing the difficulties of disentangling the various effects that can depolarize the signals from BHXRBs at low energies. We furthermore emphasize that Faraday rotation is unlikely to play a role in the polarization of the coronal X-ray emission of active galactic nuclei.",

The pulsations display strong energy dependence and negative time lags of $\\sim$0.2--0.3 ms, with harder photons leading softer ones. The broadband spectra in both epochs are well described by a soft thermal component and Comptonized continuum, together with a prominent relativistic reflection component. As the outburst evolved, the continuum softened ($\\Gamma$ increasing from $\\sim$1.88 to $\\sim$1.99) and the coronal electron temperature decreased ($kT_{\\rm e}$ from $\\sim$31 to $\\sim$18 keV), consistent with enhanced Compton cooling at lower accretion rates.

Escher, Oliver C. Gorton, Erika M. Holmbeck, Gail C. McLaughlin, Cole D. Pruitt, Andre Sieverding, Rebecca Surman High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th) Reliable predictions of weak rapid neutron capture ($\\textit{r}$-process) abundances require a systematic treatment of nuclear physics uncertainties, especially neutron capture rates far from stability. We employ new neutron capture rates from cross sections calculated with Yet Another Hauser-Feshbach Code ($\\texttt{YAHFC}$) using an uncertainty-quantified Koning-Delaroche potential modified for use on neutron-rich systems. Using these rates as a baseline, we perform Monte-Carlo studies with independent rate variations (uncorrelated Monte Carlo) and find correlations between specific neutron capture rates and the resulting elemental abundances for the three weak r-process scenarios: two separate simulations of neutron star merger remnant accretion disks and a simulation of a magnetorotational supernova. We discuss the underlying nuclear dynamics that give rise to these correlations and the role of astrophysical conditions in them. We demonstrate how reducing the uncertainty in these rates would improve the prospects for conducting precision $\\textit{r}$-process studies in the future. We additionally present a correlated Monte Carlo study, which incorporates the full covariance matrix that describes the relationships between individual neutron capture rates that arise from an uncertainty-quantified optical potential. We find that the magnitude of the uncertainty in the abundance pattern is similar to that produced by an uncorrelated Monte Carlo that employs only the on-diagonal components of the covariance matrix. We show how correlations restructure how the abundances co-vary, but do not necessarily decrease the overall uncertainty envelope.",

However, the efficiency of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) is expected to be reduced in the low-Mach-number, weakly turbulent environments characteristic of cluster merger shocks, and recent results suggest that DSA itself may not constitute a viable physical mechanism. In this work, we investigate ballistic surfing acceleration (BSA) as an electrodynamically grounded mechanism for electron energization that does not rely on prescribed diffusion coefficients. We formulate BSA under typical cluster shock conditions and derive the balance between coherent acceleration by the shock convection electric field and radiative losses due to synchrotron and inverse-Compton cooling. This balance determines both the maximum electron energy and the resulting steady-state spectrum. By forward-modeling the associated synchrotron emission and comparing it with integrated radio observations of the Sausage and Toothbrush relics, we find that the observed spectral curvature and high-frequency steepening can be reproduced when only a very small fraction ($\\sim 10^{-9} - 10^{-8}$) of the available BSA acceleration capacity contributes to systematic electron energization. Despite this extremely small efficiency, it is sufficient to accelerate electrons to Lorentz factors $\\gamma \\sim 10^4 - 10^5$ under cluster conditions. These results suggest that radio relics provide a promising astrophysical laboratory for probing coherent acceleration, and that the BSA framework may account for the production of relativistic electrons in cluster shocks.",

Yamasaki, Yutaka Fujita High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We report the multi-temperature structure of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the Centaurus cluster core observed with XRISM/Resolve. Thanks to its high energy resolution, Resolve enables us to measure fine structures of highly ionized emission lines from Si to Fe and to directly determine the excitation temperature and the ionization temperature from the emission line ratio diagnostics. The observed spectrum in the Centaurus core is well-represented by a double-temperature thermal plasma at collisional ionization equilibrium state rather than an isothermal one. The line ratio diagnostics also support this biphasic temperature structure. Particularly, the observed line ratios show a trend of increasing ionization temperature with atomic mass, while the ionization and excitation temperatures of Fe show nearly the same temperature. The resultant line ratios, which are well-represented by the two temperatures ICM, ~ 1.6 and ~ 3 keV, are also fairly consistent with the expected numbers when assuming the radial single-temperature ICM was projected in the cluster core along the line of sight. Due to the limited low-energy sensitivity of the Resolve with the gate valve closed, we investigated the effect of the cool component using the XMM-Newton/RGS spectrum, but it ultimately did not affect our results. The observed flux ratio between the Fe XXV He alpha resonance and forbidden lines shows an about 20% reduction, suggesting the presence of resonant scattering.",

Joshi 9 pages, 4 Figures, Accepted in ASTROPARTPHYS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The IceCube neutrino telescope has provided upper limits on neutrino emission from gamma ray bursts. These constraints provided by the IceCube detector have been instrumental in investigating the properties of the GRB jet and its emission models. During the prompt phase of gamma ray burst emission, intense radiation components are generated that interact with the shock-accelerated particles within the jet. We study various GRB emission models, such as the internal shock model, the photospheric models, and also include a model-independent case. Based on these models, we calculate the neutrino fluence using the photo-hadronic interaction process. We estimate the bulk Lorentz factor using the well-known correlations between prompt phase observables, which is then used to calculate the emission site for the model-dependent scenarios. For GRB 221009A, we find that a low baryon loading scenario is consistent with the IceCube upper limits; however, for GRB 240825A, a higher value of baryon loading is preferred. Also, the values of the microphysical parameters $\\epsilon_e$ and $\\epsilon_B$ for GRB 240825A are lower by factors of approximately 10 and 100, respectively, compared to those of GRB 221009A. Further, using neutrino upper limits for these two sources, we estimate the lower limits on the dissipation radius for our models. The current TeV PeV upper limits for GRB 221009A are already useful for constraining parameter space for the BPH and MPH models.",

We present and interpret the data of the nearby hydrogen-deficient but helium-rich superluminous supernova SN~2021bnw which reached a magnitude of -20.7 at maximum luminosity in g band. Methods. We discuss the light curves and spectra of SN 2021bnw based on its spectro-photometric follow up exploiting different observational facilities. We reproduce the NIR spectrum of SN 2021bnw with TARDIS to inspect the chemical composition at late photospheric phases and identify helium features. We also use a STELLA model coupling hydrodynamics and radiation transport to constrain the physical parameters of the explosion assmunig a 56Ni+CSM scenario. Results. We suggest that SN 2021bnw was mainly powered by the interaction of the ejecta with a previously lost He-rich circumstellar material, coupled with a central power source. Conclusions. This work expands the data sample of He-rich superluminous supernovae rich (SLSNe Ib) and, assuming a single progenitor scenario, can constrain the masses and the physics of their progenitors.",

Comments are welcome! Submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We introduce $\\texttt{GPUmonty}$, a CUDA/C-based Monte Carlo radiative transfer code accelerated using graphics processing units (GPUs). $\\texttt{GPUmonty}$ derives from the CPU-based code $\\texttt{grmonty}$ and offloads the most computationally expensive stages of the calculation -- superphoton generation, sampling, tracking, and scattering -- to the GPU. Whereas $\\texttt{grmonty}$ handles photons sequentially, $\\texttt{GPUmonty}$ processes large numbers of superphotons concurrently, leveraging the single-instruction, multiple-thread (SIMT) execution model of modern GPUs. Benchmarks demonstrate a speedup of about $12\\times$ relative to the original CPU implementation on a single GPU, with runtime limited primarily by register pressure rather than compute or memory bandwidth saturation. We validate the implementation through analytic tests for a optically thin synchrotron sphere, as well as comparisons with $\\texttt{igrmonty}$ for scattering synchrotron sphere and GRMHD simulation data. Relative errors remain below a percent level and convergence is consistent with the expected $N_{\\rm s}^{-1/2}$ Monte Carlo scaling. By significantly reducing computational costs, GPUmonty enables the extensive parameter space surveys and faster spectra modeling required to interpret horizon-scale observations of supermassive black holes. $\\texttt{GPUmonty}$ is publicly available under the GNU General Public License.",

We investigate a model whereby ORCs are synchrotron-emitting vortex rings formed by the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) when a shock interacts with a low-density fossil radio lobe in the intergalactic medium using 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. These rings initially exhibit oscillatory behavior that damps over time. We implement a new method to model Inverse-Compton cooling and synchrotron cooling at high frequencies in a scale-free manner, enabling us to test a wide range of model parameters against the observational constraints. We find that shock strengths of Mach 2-4 are consistent with the data, as expected in accretion, merger-driven, or active galactic nuclei-driven shocks. We find that the initial size of the bubbles required to explain the rings ranges from 140 to 250 kpc, with initial energy in the bubble of order $10^{57}-10^{59}$ erg, consistent with fossil lobes inflated by moderately powerful radio galaxies. Derived ambient pressures and densities place ORCs in low density environments, such as the outskirts of galaxy groups with ages of order 70-200 Myr. Our synthetic radio maps match the polarization properties of ORC1 and predict a dependency of the tangential magnetic field angle on the aspect ratio of ORCs. A key distinguishing trait of the RMI-driven vortex ring model is that it does not require the ORC to be centered on its host galaxy and is therefore redshift agnostic.",

The prototype CHIME/Slow pipeline was tested on archival data obtained in December 2022, January 2023 and February 2023 with a total on-sky time of 17 days with an instantaneous Field of View (FoV) of $\\sim$13 deg$^2$ . In this pilot survey, we detected nine bursts, one from a new non-repeating source and eight from the known hyperactive repeating source FRB 20220912A. Out of these nine bursts, two bursts from the repeater were not detected by CHIME/FRB, while the non-repeater was detected in the side-lobe of a beam in the CHIME/FRB exhibiting shorter pulse width and narrower bandwidth compared to the CHIME/Slow detection. Here we report properties of the bursts, discuss the sensitivity and completeness of the current version of the CHIME/Slow pipeline, and outline future development to improve its performance. Finally, based on these results, we report the all-sky rate (95% credible region) of radio transients with pulse widths between 16 ms to 5 s, fluence above 5 Jy ms and observing frequency of 600 MHz to be between 184 and 4556 bursts sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$.",

Lintott, Steve Croft, Heloise Stevance, Joshua Weston Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Modern time-domain surveys produce alert streams at a scale that makes exhaustive manual inspection infeasible, requiring automated methods to identify unusual transients for follow-up. In this work, we present an unsupervised anomaly detection pipeline applied to the ZTF alert stream using the Lasair broker. We define normal objects as SN Ia, SN II, and SN Ib/c. Anomalous objects include (i) more exotic transients (AGN, TDEs, SLSNe, CVs, and nuclear transients) and (ii) supernova-labeled objects, either spectroscopically or by Lasair, with anomalous properties, such as incorrect or absent host associations, or non-supernova-like light curves. Our pipeline consists of three independently trained simple autoencoders operating on distinct alert stream data products: object features, triplet image cutouts, and light curves. Each model is trained on predominantly normal transients, and performance is assessed using the recall of exotic objects and the purity of all anomalous objects across both a spectroscopically classified held-out test set and the live alert stream. In the test set, performance is evaluated at a fixed rank corresponding to the top ten scoring candidates, while in the alert stream it is evaluated using an anomaly threshold defined from test set behavior. Across both settings, the algorithms consistently recover exotic transients and anomalous supernovae among their top-ranked candidates. Over 25 days of live alert stream application, we identify 87 unusual supernova candidates for follow-up. The overlap between anomalies flagged by different autoencoders in the test set is non-existent, and in the alert stream is small, with maximum overlap between any two algorithms being 11 objects. The framework is data-efficient, requiring only a few thousand training examples, making it well suited for early and ongoing application to the Rubin Observatory alert stream.",

Two demographic trends are already apparent: (i) all events occur in massive, early-type parent galaxies with stellar masses $10.8 \\lesssim \\log_{10}(M_\\star/M_\\odot) \\lesssim 11.1$; and (ii) events at larger halo-centric radii ($R_{\\rm TDE}/R_{200}$) are associated with dwarf satellites ($M_\\star \\sim 10^7 M_\\odot$), while those closer to halo centers lack detected stellar counterparts. Using results from the \\texttt{ROMULUS} cosmological simulation, we show that both trends naturally arise from hierarchical galaxy formation. By combining the simulation with empirical constraints on the local galaxy population, we compute the volumetric density of WBHs, $\\phi_{\\rm WBH}(M_\\star)$, finding that it peaks at $\\log_{10}(M_\\star/M_\\odot)=11.10^{+0.05}_{-0.10}$ and that more than half of all WBHs in the local Universe reside in galaxies with $10.7 \\lesssim \\log_{10}(M_\\star/M_\\odot) \\lesssim 11.2$, explaining (i) and predicting its persistence as the sample grows. We further show that ii), i.e., the observed link between detection of stellar counterparts and $R_{\\rm TDE}/R_{200}$, is also expected from tidal stripping. These results demonstrate that off-nuclear TDEs are powered by the population of WBHs long predicted by cosmological simulations.",

Piro Submitted to AAS journals. Comments are welcome Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Double white dwarfs (DWDs) are by far the most common compact binaries in the Milky Way, are important low-frequency gravitational-wave sources, and in some cases merge to become Type Ia supernovae. So far, no DWD has been identified solely through relativistic Doppler beaming, even though the beaming amplitude directly relates to the radial velocity semi-amplitude. In this work, we initiate a comprehensive binary population synthesis using SeBa and incorporate the resulting binaries into a tripartite Galaxy model. Our proof-of-concept simulations demonstrate that the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) can reliably recover relatively bright ($r \\lesssim20~$mag) unequal-mass binaries in compact orbits with P $\\approx$ 10-600 minutes with moderate to high inclinations. We find that LSST can detect at least 287 short-period DWDs, of which 47 are LISA-detectable gravitational wave sources. LSST lightcurves allow us to readily determine the period and fully characterize the orbit, in contrast with the challenges of orbit determination for DWDs in spectroscopic searches. The formation of unequal mass, short-period DWDs strongly depends on the assumptions regarding the mass-transfer phases during binary population synthesis, and the total number and characteristics of Doppler-beamed DWD systems observed in LSST will provide new tests of models of stellar binary evolution. Here, we lay the foundation for the comprehensive integration of synthetic Galactic binary population into realistic LSST survey simulations, thereby enabling quantitative forecasts of the number and characteristics of any binary sub-population during the LSST era.",

Most FRB sources are detected only once, while some are repeaters. Variation patterns observed in the rotation measure (RM) of some repeaters -- indicate that the local magneto-ionic environments of these FRB sources are highly dynamic. It has been suggested that a Be star-magnetar binary system is a possible origin for such variation. FRB 20201124A is notable among these sources since it is the most active one and exhibits substantial temporal variations of RM measured by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The physics behind this long-term behavior is poorly understood. Here we propose that, within the framework of the Be star-magnetar binary scenario, the observed variation of RM is attributed to a combination of orbital motion and the precession of the circumstellar disk of the Be star. While a ~785-day precession of the disk contributes to the observed decrease in the amplitude of the variation, our model predicts that the amplitude oscillates with this period.",

Comments welcome! High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The gravitational-wave signal from the neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger GW200105 is consistent with this binary having significant orbital eccentricity close to merger. This raises the question of how eccentric NSBHs form. Compact binaries that evolve in isolation radiate away any orbital eccentricity long before their gravitational-wave signal enters the sensitive frequency range of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network. Meanwhile, dynamical environments -- which can be conducive to mergers on eccentric orbits -- produce very few NSBHs. Here, we focus on a formation channel that efficiently produces NSBHs with both misaligned spins and significant eccentricity close to merger: isolated field triples. We estimate the minimum measurable eccentricity of NSBHs at 10 Hz orbit-averaged gravitational-wave frequency, e_min,10, finding that for GW200105, GW200115, and GW230529-like systems, e_min,10 is O(0.01). For a GW190814-like unequal-mass binary with significant higher-order mode content, e_min,10 = 0.003; this is an order of magnitude lower than when higher modes are not present. For dominant-mode signals from binaries with $m_2=1.5$~M$_\\odot$ and total masses from $3\\,{\\rm M_\\odot} \\leq M \\leq50\\,\\rm M_\\odot$, we find $0.008 \\leq$ e_min,10 $\\leq 0.022$. The relationship between $M$ and e_min,10 is linear when the binaries are non-spinning. When the binaries are maximally spin-precessing, e_min,10 decreases as mass ratio becomes more unequal. We estimate the sensitivity of a quasi-circular aligned-spin templated search to NSBH mergers from field triples, finding that we recover only 46% of systems that would have been detected with a search containing the full physics of the injected population. Finally, we show that if $\\sim\\nicefrac{1}{3}$ of present NSBH detections are measurably eccentric, then $\\geq40\\%$ are consistent with an isolated field triple origin.",

Coherent pulsations not firmly detected; magnetic field strength remains uncertain. We analyze NuSTAR observations to characterize hard X-ray timing and spectral properties, test robustness of candidate cyclotron features, and constrain magnetic field and accretion regime. We perform timing and spectral analysis of two observations, modeling spectra with continua used for accreting pulsars, and use simulations to assess significance of features. No coherent pulsations detected; pulsed fraction constrained below 1.5\\%. Spectra are well described by absorbed blackbody plus cutoff power-law continuum, showing residuals around 20 keV and 40--50 keV. Features improve fits but do not constitute firm cyclotron detections. Intensity-resolved spectroscopy suggests possible shifts of apparent line centroid.

Due to often rapidly fading emission profiles, understanding how and when to observe these sources is crucial both to test theoretical predictions and efficiently optimize available telescope time. The information extracted from the tools included in sensipy can be used to help astronomers investigate the detectability of sources considering various theoretical assumptions about their emission processes and mechanisms.

Wissel updated version improves equations used for ray tracing and focusing correction as used in the current NuRadioMC software version Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) NuRadioMC is a Monte Carlo framework designed to simulate ultra-high energy neutrino detectors that rely on the radio detection method. This method exploits the radio emission generated in the electromagnetic component of a particle shower following a neutrino interaction. NuRadioMC simulates everything from the neutrino interaction in a medium, the subsequent Askaryan radio emission, the propagation of the radio signal to the detector and finally the detector response. NuRadioMC is designed as a modern, modular Python-based framework, combining flexibility in detector design with user-friendliness. It includes a state-of-the-art event generator, an improved modelling of the radio emission, a revisited approach to signal propagation and increased flexibility and precision in the detector simulation. This paper focuses on the implemented physics processes and their implications for detector design. A variety of models and parameterizations for the radio emission of neutrino-induced showers are compared and reviewed. Comprehensive examples are used to discuss the capabilities of the code and different aspects of instrumental design decisions.",

James The Astrophysical Journal, Volume 998, Issue 1, id.1, 7 pp. 2026 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) It has been proposed that measurements of scattering times ($\\tau$) from fast radio bursts (FRB) may be used to infer the FRB host dispersion measure (DM) and its redshift. This approach relies on the existence of a correlation between $\\tau$ and DM within FRB hosts such as that observed for Galactic pulsars. We assess the measurability of a $\\tau - $DM$_{\\rm host}$ relation through simulated observations of FRBs within the ASKAP/CRAFT survey, taking into account instrumental effects. We show that even when the FRB hosts intrinsically follow the $\\tau - $DM relation measured for pulsars, this correlation cannot be inferred from FRB observations; this limitation arises mostly from the large variance around the average cosmic DM value given by the Macquart relation, the variance within the $\\tau - $DM relation itself, and observational biases against large $\\tau$ values. We argue that theoretical relations have little utility as priors on redshift, e.g., for purposes of galaxy identification, and that the recent lack of an observed correlation between scattering and DM in the ASKAP/CRAFT survey is not unexpected, even if our understanding of a $\\tau - $DM$_{\\rm host}$ relation is correct.",

We argue that s-process enrichment in the non-degenerate companion provides a powerful diagnostic for identifying WDs that formed via mergers in hierarchical triple systems. For a massive WD, standard single-star evolution requires a massive (>~4 Msun) progenitor, yet such progenitors produce negligible s-process yields. We define IK Peg-type systems as those exhibiting this mass-yield tension: barium-enhanced companions orbiting WDs too massive to have descended from efficient s-process producers. The well-known system IK Peg exemplifies this class. Applying this framework to published spectroscopic data reveals several additional candidates, and we estimate that a few dozen such systems should exist in the current Gaia sample. If these systems trace inner-binary mergers in primordial triples, they represent observable intermediate stages toward eventual Type Ia supernovae via the double-merger pathway, as predicted by recent population-synthesis models.",

Submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate the physical origin of star formation suppression in gas-rich early-type galaxies using five high-resolution hydrodynamical idealized galaxy simulations, performed with the moving-mesh code AREPO. These simulations include one Milky Way-like galaxy and four early-type galaxies, of which one early-type galaxy is found to have significantly less star formation despite a substantial molecular gas reservoir. We apply a modified virial theorem to the overdensities in each galaxy to quantify the forces regulating their stability and thus star formation. We find evidence that, in the suppressed galaxy, strong Coriolis forces driven by elevated galactic shear may inhibit gravitational collapse. This is caused by the galaxy's high central compactness, providing a physical mechanism for the suppression of star formation that does not require the removal of molecular gas. In contrast, less compact early-type galaxies host more gravity-dominated clouds and therefore exhibit higher star formation rates. However, we find that this gravitational stability occurs without significantly increasing the classical Toomre-Q parameter, and therefore a new criterion for suppressed star formation may be needed. We also discuss the impact of our choice of overdensity scale and connections to observations of molecular clouds.",

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a panchromatic optical-mm characterization of GNz7q, a recently identified X-ray weak, rapidly growing red quasar embedded within a dusty starburst galaxy at $z=7.1899$, using the full suite of JWST/NIRCam, NIRSpec, MIRI, and archival NOEMA observations. Our deep NIRSpec/G395M spectroscopy reveals unambiguous broad Balmer emission (FWHM $=2221\\pm20$kms$^{-1}$), confirming a super-Eddington accreting black hole ($\\lambda_{\\rm Edd}=2.7\\pm0.4$) with a mass of $\\log(M_{\\rm BH}/M_{\\odot})=7.55\\pm0.34$, using accretion-rate corrected BH mass estimators. After subtracting the point source, we robustly detect stellar emission from the host galaxy across multiple NIRCam and MIRI filters. Out joint morphological-spectral analysis yields a stellar mass of $\\log (M_*/M_\\odot)=10.5\\pm0.4$ and an intense star formation rate of ${\\rm SFR}=330\\pm97\\,M_\\odot\\,\\rm yr^{-1}$, confirming the host as a massive, dusty starburst galaxy. We find that GNz7q lies on the local $M_{\\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation ($M_{\\rm BH}/M_*\\simeq 0.001$) and is well positioned to evolve into the locus of massive SDSS quasars with $\\log (M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\odot)\\approx 9$ and $M_*\\approx 10^{11}\\,M_\\odot$ at $z\\sim 6$, owing to its remarkably rapid growth in both the black hole and its host galaxy. This stands in stark contrast to many recently reported JWST AGN populations at similar redshifts, including the little red dots (LRDs), whose weak or undetected star formation makes it difficult for them to grow into the massive galaxies hosting SDSS-like quasars. These results suggest that GNz7q marks as a rare, pivotal phase of early BH-galaxy co-eolution, plausibly providing a crucial direct pathway to the supermassive black hole systems within the first billion years of the Universe.",

A feature at 1.05 $\\mu$m arising from electronic transitions in PAH cations is predicted by laboratory experiments but has never been observationally confirmed. We conduct a dedicated search for this feature in absorption on a highly-extinguished sight line toward BD+40 4223, a blue supergiant in Cyg OB2, using the TripleSpec spectrograph at Palomar Observatory. We place a $5\\sigma$ upper limit on the feature strength of $\\Delta\\tau_{1.05}/A_{V} < 5.6 \\times10^{-3}$, ruling out theoretical estimates with $> 10\\sigma$ significance. We constrain the effective temperature of BD+40 4223 to be $\\log_{10}\\left(T_{\\rm eff}\\right)=4.41\\pm0.03$ and infer that it is veiled by $6.39\\pm0.05$ magnitudes of visual extinction, consistent with but more constraining than previous determinations. As dust on the sight line toward BD+40 4223 appears typical of the diffuse interstellar medium, this non-detection challenges existing models of PAH material properties and/or charge distribution.",

Callen (OAC/UNC - IATE/CONICET/UNC) 11 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) [Abridged] We investigate how the identification of Hickson-like CGs depends on the observer's reference frame, quantifying how frequently the same system would be recognised from different vantage points. Using a mock lightcone built from the Millennium I Simulation plus a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, we identified 7709 CGs when applying the standard Hickson-like criteria. For each CG, we placed 1000 random observers on a surrounding sphere and reapplied the velocity and compactness requirements to test recoverability. We also examined the variation of population and local isolation. The velocity concordance criterion shows modest sensitivity to the observer's location: 10% of CGs fail for some observers, typically groups with members with high peculiar velocities (>1000 km/s). The compactness requirement is far more fragile, as 44% of CGs are missed by most observers, and these systems are very elongated or are chance alignments in real space. Tightening selection limits reduces this dependence. Lowering the surface brightness threshold to $\\mu \\leq 23 \\ mag/arcsec^2$ reduces the compactness dependence to 16%, while reducing the velocity limit to $\\Delta V\\leq 250 \\ km/s$ lowers velocity-driven failures to less than 4%. Applying both cuts simultaneously yields up to 84% observer-independent groups, although with a substantially smaller sample. Population and isolation are affected by bright interlopers seen from different directions. While such interlopers are common, they have only a minor effect on the compactness and velocity concordance criteria; however, the local isolation is commonly broken. Observer frame effects, dominated by the compactness criterion, can significantly bias Hickson-like CG samples. However, adjusting surface brightness and velocity difference thresholds allows users to balance the physical reliability according to their specific scientific goals.",

Nunes, A.B.A. Queiroz, J. G. Fernández-Trincado, A.L. Rocha de Abreu, A. Plotnikova Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The inner Galaxy is the most complex region of the Milky Way, comprising the bulge, inner thin and thick discs, and inner halo; the formation of the bar transferred gas and stars from the disc inward. Accretion of dwarf galaxies also occurred over the Galaxy's lifetime, merging with the original bulge. In this work, we constrain the metal-rich stars of the earliest spheroidal bulge. To study the oldest bulge stars, distributed in a spheroid, we applied kinematical and dynamical criteria in the metal-rich range [Fe/H] > -0.8. This complements our previous analysis of a symmetric sample with [Fe/H] < -0.8. We derived individual abundances through spectral synthesis for C, N, O, Al, P, S, K, Mn, and Ce using stellar parameters from APOGEE DR17, and compared the results with literature data and chemical-evolution models. The alpha elements Mg, Si, and Ca, and iron-peak elements V, Cr, Co, and Ni follow the expected trends relative to the models. Mn shows secondary behaviour. S and K display significant star-to-star scatter but remain broadly compatible with predictions. Phosphorus and cerium show an excess around [Fe/H] $\\sim$ -0.7, more pronounced than in the metal-poor sample, suggesting a distinctive signature of the earliest bulge population. Diagrams of [Mg/Mn] versus [Al/Fe] and [Ni/Fe] versus [(C+N)/O] indicate an in situ origin for most stars. At super-solar metallicities, a subset shows enhanced K and Mn (possibly S) with low [Ce/Fe], hinting at enrichment linked to the nuclear disc and bar, and tracing a chemically distinct population shaped by the innermost Galaxy.",

We introduce a machine learning framework that bypasses these limitations by treating the complete 2.75-20 micron emission spectrum as a high-dimensional fingerprint. Using a Random Forest classifier trained on a dataset of 23,653 spectra, we achieve a robust classification F1-score of about 0.96 across 12 size and charge categories. Our model maintains high performance on synthetic mixtures of unseen molecules. Feature importance analysis reveals that PAH size diagnostics are not universal but highly charge-dependent; while neutral size is traced mainly by C-H stretching modes, sizing ionized species also relies on the morphology of 6-8 micron C-C complexes, with the 12.5 micron feature emerging as a robust cross-charge tracer. This approach provides a robust, data-driven pathway for decoding the physical conditions of the interstellar medium.",

By decomposing the broad and narrow components of the Balmer emission lines, we investigate the connection between line emission and UV/optical continua for the LRD population. We find that the broad H$\\alpha$ luminosity strongly correlates with the optical continuum (but not with the UV), indicating a common AGN origin for both. In contrast, the [O III] line strength is correlated with the UV continuum rather than the optical. Using the width and luminosity of the broad H$\\alpha$ line, we estimate central black hole masses of $10^6-10^8 M_{\\odot}$ accreting at high Eddington ratios, consistent with an early ($\\lambda_{\\rm Edd} \\sim 0.6$), rapid-growth phase of AGN evolution. Assuming a constant mass accretion rate in the framework of slim-disk models, we infer growth timescales of $\\sim 10^5-10^7\\rm yr$, and suggest LRDs may evolve into narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. Upper limits from our spectra indicate that LRDs exhibit intrinsically weak optical Fe II emission compared to typical AGN. To simultaneously account for the inferred broad-line region size and observed luminosity, we propose a \"Clumpy Envelope\" model in which the optical emission arises from an extended, clumpy gas with a characteristic radius of tens of light-days. The diversity in observed optical continuum shapes can be explained by radial temperature gradients and self-absorption effects within this structure. Our results demonstrate the power of JWST high-resolution spectroscopy in probing the central engines and physical nature of the LRD population.",

However, analyzing these AIBs remains challenging because of the immense structural diversity within the PAH family, which makes the computation of reliable reference spectra difficult. To address this, we developed an efficient graph neural network (GNN) framework that can predict PAH absorption spectra up to 10,000 times faster than traditional quantum chemical methods. We evaluated four representative GNN architectures, including graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), message passing neural network (MPNN), and attentive fingerprint (AFP). The AFP model is found to deliver the best overall performance and is further trained using five different spectral distance metrics as loss functions, among which the Jensen-Shannon divergence yields the most accurate and stable results. The model performs best for PAHs containing 20-40 carbon atoms, while accuracy decreases for larger molecules, reflecting the limited availability of training data. Overall, this framework offers a fast method to generate approximate reference spectra for small- to medium-sized PAHs, supporting future AIB analysis.",

Shocks from interacting components encode the temperature and density distribution, offering a direct probe of the earliest evolution history. However, interferometric observations characterizing warm envelopes using high-excitation lines remain scarce. We present ALMA Band 9 observations of the Taurus dense core MC 27/L1521F, which hosts a Class 0 protostar, targeting the CO($J$=6-5) line at an angular resolution of $\\sim$2\\arcsec\\ ($\\approx$300 au). We detect an off-centered ring-like structure with a diameter of $\\sim$1000 au that was not identifiable in previous low-$J$ CO data, where emission close to the systemic velocity is strongly affected by optical depth. The ring shows a typical peak brightness temperature of $\\sim$3 K at our resolution. Excitation considerations indicate that the detected CO($J$=6-5) emission likely arises from relatively warm ($T \\gtrsim 20$ K) and dense ($n({\\rm H_2}) \\gtrsim 10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) gas embedded within the surrounding cold, dense core. The morphology and kinematics suggest an energetic and localized shock-heating event, potentially linked to dynamical gas--magnetic-field interactions in the earliest protostellar phase. Our results demonstrate that high-$J$ CO observations provide a powerful new window on warm and dense gas components, enabling a more direct view of the physical processes operating at the onset of star formation.",

The code integrates three key components: (1) Kamelung, a 1D hydrodynamics module simulating gravitational collapse up to first hydrostatic core (FHSC) formation followed by an accretion of envelope onto a young star; (2) Presta, a chemical evolution module post-processing density and temperature profiles to compute time-dependent molecular abundances; and (3) Uran(IA), a radiative transfer module generating synthetic molecular line spectra. We apply Gorynych to compare low-mass (5 Msun) and high-mass (50 Msun) cores, finding that their dynamical evolution is remarkably similar, with differences primarily in spatial scaling. Chemical evolution reveals sharp abundance changes during the FHSC transition, particularly for CO, H2O, and HCO+, though pre-collapse chemical initialization has minimal impact on most species. Spectral maps of 13CO(2-1), HCO+(3-2), and H2O(110--101) lines show distinct kinematic signatures of infall and depletion, with high-mass cores exhibiting spatially extended emission.

We analyzed contaminations related to host galaxies, particularly from polar dust, the interstellar medium, and stellar emission that affect the optical and infrared. We used a sample of nearly 400 quasars with photometrical observations and spectroscopical redshift divided into four redshift bins (0.7-2.4). Full spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting was performed with the CIGALE code, and results were compared with simplified photometric luminosity estimates. The impact of non-active galactic nucleus components and the role of polar dust in the fitting process were assessed. We show that for sources with a disk luminosity above 10^45 [erg/s], the photometric estimates are consistent with SED-based values. While polar dust contributes marginally to luminosity, its presence significantly alters SED fitting, particularly the torus opening angle and cold dust properties. In the optical domain, stellar emission is the dominant contamination. In the infrared, disk emission and cold dust play major roles. We propose two empirical calibrations for the OPT-IR relation. We conclude that the optical band is dominated by the accretion disk component above 10^45 or 10^46 [erg/s] depending on redshift, while IR luminosity is dominated by the dusty torus emission above 1.6 $\\times$ 10^45 or 2 $\\times$ 10^46 [erg/s] depending on the redshift. In this high-luminosity regime, simplified photometric methods yield reliable disk and torus luminosity estimates. The aim of the analysis we present is to test the parameter space in order to build a well behaving OPT-IR nonlinear luminosity relation for quasars that could serve as a cosmological probe.",

To test the contribution of massive stars to fluorine production in the early Universe, we conducted Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band~5 spectroscopy of the HF(1-0) absorption line toward a dusty star-forming galaxy at $z=6.024$. This galaxy has a known gas-phase metallicity and is too young for low-mass AGB stars to have contributed significantly, providing a clean environment to isolate massive-star yields. We do not detect significant HF absorption ($\\sim2\\sigma$) and derive a conservative 5$\\sigma$ upper limit of $N_\\mathrm{HF}/N_\\mathrm{H_2} < 2.2\\times10^{-9}$. This limit is about an order of magnitude below typical local measurements, indicating inefficient fluorine enrichment $\\sim0.9$\\,Gyr after the Big Bang.

Mercurio Accepted for publication on Astronomy & Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The Magellanic Clouds (MCs) offer a unique laboratory for studying galaxy interaction and the evolution of dwarf galaxies. By investigating when and how stars formed, the star formation history (SFH) is a powerful tool to provide constraints for dynamical modeling of the system's past interactions and understand the processes of stripping and triggered star formation in tidally influenced environments. We aim to reconstruct the SFH of the Magellanic Bridge, the gaseous and stellar stream connecting the two Clouds. We used data from the deep optical STEP survey, which covers 54 $\\mathrm{deg\\, {^{2}}}$ across the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and the Bridge, reaching stars below the oldest main sequence turnoff at the distance of the MCs. We applied the synthetic color-magnitude diagram (CMD) technique to 14 deg$^2$ of STEP data. We constructed two libraries of synthetic stellar populations based on the PARSEC-COLIBRI and BaSTI stellar evolutionary models, with metallicities in the range $-2.0\\leq[$Fe/H$]\\leq0$ across the whole Hubble time. We find a clear peak of recent star formation $\\sim100$ Myr ago in the Magellanic Bridge, which becomes increasingly pronounced toward the SMC. The low metallicity of this population suggests that it formed from gas stripped from the SMC during its most recent close encounter with the LMC. In the eastern part of the Bridge (LMC side), the star formation peaks at earlier times, around 10 Gyr and 2 Gyr ago. We estimate a total stellar mass in the Bridge of $ (5.1 \\pm 0.2) \\times 10^5 M_\\odot$ and a present-day stellar metallicity of $[$Fe/H$]\\sim0.6$ dex, close to SMC value.",

Stanton, Dirk Scholte Under revision with MNRAS. 13 pages, 6 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The unprecedented rest-frame UV and optical coverage provided by JWST enables simultaneous constraints on the electron density (n$_{\\rm e}$) and temperature (T$_{\\rm e}$) of ionized gas in galaxies at z>5. We present a self-consistent direct method based on multiple OIII]1661,66) and [OIII] ($\\lambda$4363, and $\\lambda$5007) transitions to characterize the physical conditions of the high-ionization zone. This new approach is insensitive to a wide range of n$_{\\rm e}$ due to the high critical densities of the OIII] and [OIII] transitions. Applying this technique to six galaxies at z=5-9, we find electron densities up to n$_{\\rm e}$$\\sim 3\\times 10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$ and temperatures of T$_{\\rm e}$ $\\sim 20,000$ K in systems at $z>6$. Accounting for these self-consistent densities changes the derived T$_{\\rm e}$ and modifies the inferred metallicities by up to 0.29 dex relative to previous estimates. We discuss the reported N/O overabundances in the high-$z$ galaxies from our sample, which arise entirely from the high N$^{3+}$/H$^{+}$ values inferred from NIV] lines. We point out that a T$_{\\rm e}$-stratification, in which the N$^{3+}$ zone has a slightly higher T$_{\\rm e}$ than T$_{\\rm e}$([OIII]), could substantially reduce the inferred N/O. Quantitatively, if T$_{\\rm e}$(N$^{3+}$) were 10\\% higher than T$_{\\rm e}$([OIII]), this could induce a systematic overestimation of N$^{3+}$/O$^{2+}$ of nearly 50\\%. Classical N/O diagnostics such as N$^{+}$/O$^{+}$, due to their critical densities, can significantly impact the inferred N/O abundance in the presence of high-density gas, whereas N$^{2+}$/O$^{2+}$ place these galaxies closer to $z\\sim0$ systems in the N/O-O/H plane. Future JWST programs with larger and more diverse samples will be essential to test the universality and robustness of these results.",

Mortlock, Amy L. Rankine, Emma Curtis-Lake, Yirui Zheng, Adam C. Carnall, Peter H. Johansson Submitted to MNRAS. Main text: 20 pages, 9 figures. Data url will be released upon acceptance Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Post-starburst (PSB) galaxies, having recently experienced a starburst followed by rapid quenching, are excellent laboratories to probe physical mechanisms that drive starbursts and shutting down of star formation. Integral-field spectroscopy reveals the galaxies' spatially-resolved properties, where observed directional patterns can be linked to the galaxies' past evolution. We measure the resolved star-formation histories (SFHs), stellar metallicity evolution and dust properties of three local PSBs from the MaNGA survey, down to $0.5$\" resolution ($\\sim0.3\\,$kpc) using a hierarchical Bayesian model. Local parameters were constrained simultaneously with parameters describing spatial trends. We found that all three galaxies first experienced an outer, weaker and slower quenching starburst, followed by a central, stronger and faster quenching starburst that peaked $\\sim 1\\,$Gyr after the first. The central starbursts induced a significantly stronger rise in stellar metallicity compared to the outer starbursts. These results are consistent with the effects of a recent gas-rich (wet) merger, where the first pericentre passage triggered starbursts in the outer regions, while the later coalescence triggers a stronger centralised starburst. We find non-axisymmetric features in the maps of burst mass fraction and dust attenuation in all galaxies, which could be caused by tidal effects during the recent merger. Comparisons with literature binary merger simulations suggests that the galaxies' rapid quenching was driven by gas consumption and the stabilisation against gas gravitational collapse by a growing spheroid, while AGN feedback was not necessarily a primary cause.",

II. impact of the rotational energy difference between adsorbed ortho-H$_2$ and para-H$_2$ and implication to deuterium fractionation chemistry Kenji Furuya, Toshiki Sugimoto, Kazunari Iwasaki, Masashi Tsuge, Naoki Watanabe 18 pages, 9 Figures, Accepted in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate how the H$_2$ ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) and dueterium fractionation in star-forming regions are affected by nuclear spin conversion (NSC) on dust grains. Particular focus is placed on the rotational energy difference between ortho-H$_2$ (o-H$_2$) and para-H$_2$ (p-H$_2$) on grain surfaces. While the ground state of o-H$_2$ has a higher rotational energy than that of p-H$_2$ by 170.5 K in the gas phase, this energy difference is expected to become smaller on solid surfaces, where interactions between the surface and adsorbed H$_2$ molecules affect their rotational motion. A previous study by Furuya et al. (2019) developed a rigorous formulation of the rate for the temporal variation of the H$_2$ OPR via the NSC on grains, assuming that adsorbed o-H$_2$ has higher rotational energy than adsorbed p-H$_2$ by 170.5 K, as in the gas phase. In this work, we relax the assumption and re-evaluate the rate, varying the rotational energy difference between their ground states. The re-evaluated rate is incorporated into a gas-ice astrochemical model to study the evolution of the H$_2$ OPR and the deuterium fractionation in prestellar cores and the outer, cold regions of protostellar envelopes. The inclusion of the NSC on grains reduces the timescale of the H2 OPR evolution and thus the deuterium fractionation, at densities of >10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$ and temperatures of <14-16 K (depending on the rotational energy difference), when the ionization rate of H$_2$ is 10$^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$.",

During this phase, protoplanets may develop gaseous envelopes that are warmer than the surrounding disk gas, potentially providing observable signatures through molecules otherwise depleted in cold regions. In this Letter, we report the detection of the silicon sulfide isotopologues ${\\rm ^{28}SiS}\\ J{=}16{-}15$ and ${\\rm ^{30}SiS}\\ J{=}18{-}17$ in the protoplanetary disk around PDS 66 (MP Mus) at a significance of ${\\sim}5{-}6\\sigma$, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. These constitute the second and first detections of $\\rm ^{28}SiS$ and $\\rm ^{30}SiS$ in a protoplanetary disk, respectively. The emission appears as a compact source at $r \\simeq 60$ au in the southwestern region of the disk, unresolved with a ${\\sim}0.\\!\\!^{\\prime\\prime}5$ beam, and shows a velocity consistent with Keplerian rotation, suggesting a protoplanetary origin. By modeling the line fluxes, we constrain the emitting radius to ${\\sim}0.5{-}4$ au and estimate an SiS mass of $10^{22}{-}10^{23}$ g, corresponding to at least ${\\sim}10\\%$ of the silicon contained in local dust grains. Because complete sublimation of a substantial fraction of dust grains by local processes is difficult to achieve, this result instead implies an accumulation of silicon from a larger region. We propose that a circumplanetary envelope surrounding a low-mass protoplanet, where pebble accretion and subsequent sublimation of grains may enhance gaseus silicon abundance with respect to observable dust grains around it, can account for the observed characteristics.",

Mróz Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We report the discovery and characterization of a planetary companion in the microlensing event KMT-2016-BLG-1337, which was produced by a binary system of low-mass stars. The light curve of the event exhibits a short-term anomaly superposed on the profile of a binary-lens single-source (2L1S) model. To investigate the nature of this anomaly, we performed detailed modeling under both the binary-lens binary-source (2L2S) and triple-lens single-source (3L1S) interpretations. The 3L1S model provides a substantially better fit to the data, strongly favoring the presence of a planetary companion in the lens system. Two viable $3L1S$ solutions describe the event nearly equally well. In one solution, the planet has a mass of $M_3 \\sim 0.3~M_{\\mathrm{J}}$ and lies at a projected separation of $a_{\\perp,3} \\sim 4~{\\rm au}$ from the heavier member of the host binary. In the alternative solution, the planet has a mass of $M_3 \\sim 7~M_{\\mathrm{J}}$ and a projected separation of $a_{\\perp,3} \\sim 1.5~{\\rm au}$. The host binary consists of early M-type dwarfs with masses of $M_1 \\sim 0.54~M_\\odot$ and $M_2 \\sim 0.40~M_\\odot$, separated in projection by $a_{\\perp,2} \\sim 3.5~{\\rm au}$. The system is located at a distance of $D_{\\rm L} \\sim 7~{\\rm kpc}$ toward the Galactic bulge. This event demonstrates the sensitivity of microlensing to planets in dynamically complex stellar environments, including systems beyond the reach of other detection techniques. It thereby contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of planet formation in multiple-star systems.",

Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present time-series medium-band (R~20-40) observations of the third interstellar object 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) obtained with the 7-Dimensional Telescope (7DT), enabling spatially resolved monitoring of its gas and dust activity from 2025 July to September. The m400-band image (lambda_c = 400 nm, Delta lambda approx 25 nm) reveals the emergence of pronounced and spatially extended CN emission at heliocentric distances r_h < 3 au. This onset is consistently identified across multiple diagnostics, including a break in the light-curve evolution, excess reflectance, inward expansion of annular excess beyond 10,000-20,000 km, growth of the coma half-light radius from ~11,000 to ~19,000 km, and a rapid rise in the CN production rate Q_CN relative to Af rho. We further separate the CN-emitting and dust-scattered components through two-dimensional surface-brightness fitting into inner (dust) and outer (gas) components. The outer component preserves a nearly constant profile shape, varying only in normalization, implying relatively fast expansion of CN-bearing molecules. Together, these results reveal a transition in the optical from dust-dominated scattering at large heliocentric distances to volatile-driven, gas-dominated activity as 3I/ATLAS enters the inner Solar System. The timing and characteristics of the CN activation resemble the volatile enhancement observed in 2I/Borisov, suggesting that both known active interstellar objects exhibit comparable activation behavior at heliocentric distances of ~2-3 au.",

Swinbank (Durham-CEA) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a novel method of combining kinematic models obtained at multiple spatial resolution levels in a self-consistent manner. The MHONGOOSE survey has mapped atomic hydrogen emission in $30$ nearby dwarf and spiral galaxies. Each galaxy is imaged at multiple resolution levels with unprecedented dynamic range in spatial resolution (from $\\sim 10''$ to $ 90''$) and HI sensitivity, with the latter varying by almost a factor of $30$ across all resolution scales. We use radial weighting functions to combine kinematic models from all resolution levels. The weights are derived from the residuals of model fits to a set of observations of synthetic model galaxies with known rotation curves and geometries. We obtain combined (weighted and smoothed) inclination and position angle profiles for each galaxy. These suppress the sharp, often unphysical radial fluctuations arising in single-resolution profiles. We then fit the rotation speed and velocity dispersion profiles at each resolution level with the geometric profiles fixed to the combined profiles, finally combining these using the same weighting and smoothing approach. The combined rotation curves utilise all of the available information and have smaller typical systematic errors compared to those obtained using a single resolution level, particularly near the centres and outer edges of models. This initial demonstration is promising; there is scope to further refine the process to use such information-rich observations to their full potential.",

The median post-starburst visibility time is $\\sim600$ Myr, with more massive galaxies ($\\log \\textrm{M}_*/\\textrm{M}_\\odot > 10.7$) exhibiting shorter visibility times than lower mass galaxies. The range of quenching times -- defined as the time from the peak starburst to the time of quiescence -- found in this sample ($0.06-1.75$ Gyr) suggests multiple quenching pathways, consistent with previous studies. We do not see evidence for quenching mechanisms varying with redshift between $1<z<3$. We detect evidence for weak AGN activity in 4 out of the 8 galaxies with robust emission line detections, based on line ratio diagnostics. Our findings suggest that there are a diverse range of quenching mechanisms at cosmic noon, and support a scenario in which the primary quenching mechanisms are rapid ($<500$ Myr) following a starburst.",

      "abstract": "Geometry of the Milky Way's dark matter from dynamical models of the tilted stellar halo Adam M. Dillamore, Jason L. Sanders 17 pages, 15 figures, published in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The shape and orientation of the Milky Way's dark matter halo remain poorly constrained. Observations of the accreted stellar halo show that it is triaxial and tilted with respect to the disc. If this configuration is long-lived, it can place constraints on the shape and orientation of the dark matter halo that can support it close to steady state. We use a novel method to fit equilibrium orbit-superposition (Schwarzschild) models to the stellar halo in a realistic Milky Way potential with a tilted dark matter halo. We assume that the long axes of each halo and the disc normal are coplanar. These models are matched to parametric density fits and velocity anisotropy measurements of Gaia Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) stars at radii $r\\in[6,60]$ kpc. The observations are consistent with a (near-)prolate dark matter halo whose density has a short-to-long axis ratio of $q_\\mathrm{dm}=0.87_{-0.09}^{+0.05}$. The long axis is inclined at an angle of $\\beta_\\mathrm{dm}=43_{-8}^{+22}\\,^\\circ$ to the disc plane, which exceeds the stellar halo tilt by $\\approx18^\\circ$. Spherical haloes cannot support the observed structure of the GSE in equilibrium. The best-fitting dynamical GSE model has a radius-dependent shape and orientation; between radii of 6 and 60~kpc the tilt increases from $\\beta_*(r)\\approx10^\\circ$ to $\\approx35^\\circ$. Our model provides a good fit to the observed triaxial structure and dynamics of the GSE. It is therefore an excellent source of realistic initial conditions for simulations of the halo, such as for investigating perturbations from satellites or the Galactic bar.",

Stuber, Tony D. Weinbeck, Thomas G. Williams Accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission is widely used to trace the distribution of molecular gas in the interstellar medium, exhibiting a tight correlation with CO(2-1) emission across nearby galaxies. Using PHANGS-JWST and PHANGS-ALMA data, we identify localized regions where this correlation fails, with CO flux exceeding that predicted from 7.7$\\mu$m PAH emission by more than an order of magnitude. These outlier regions are found in 20 out of 70 galaxies and are located in galaxy centers and bars, without signs of massive star formation. We explore two scenarios to explain the elevated CO-to-PAH ratios, which can either be due to suppressed PAH emission or enhanced CO emissivity. We examine PAH emission in other bands (3.3$\\mu$m and 11.3$\\mu$m) and the dust continuum dominated bands (10$\\mu$m and 21$\\mu$m), finding consistently high CO-to-PAH (or CO-to-dust continuum) emission ratios, suggesting that 7.7$\\mu$m PAH emission is not particularly suppressed. In some outlier regions, PAH sizes and spectral energy distribution of the radiation differ slightly from nearby control regions with normal CO-to-PAH ratios, though without a consistent trend. We find that the outlier regions show higher CO velocity dispersions ($\\Delta v_{\\mathrm{CO}}$). This increase in $\\Delta v_{\\mathrm{CO}}$ lowers CO optical depth and raises its emissivity for a given gas mass. Our results favor a scenario where shear along the bar lanes and shocks at the bar ends elevate CO emissivity, leading to the breakdown of the CO-PAH correlation. Future JWST spectroscopy and deep ALMA observations of CO isotopologues will provide critical tests of this scenario.",

Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics The Open Journal of Astrophysics, Vol 9, Feb 13, 2026 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) is an intriguing alternative to the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm, which predicts that dark matter halos typically have large, isothermal cores. Numerical simulations have shown that dynamical friction ceases to operate in cores of (roughly) constant density, a phenomenon known as core stalling. In addition, such cores often are unstable to a dipole instability that gives rise to dynamical buoyancy, causing massive central objects to move outward. Thus far, these manifestations of core dynamics have only been demonstrated in collisionless systems. In this paper, we use idealized N-body simulations to study whether core stalling and dynamical buoyancy operate in SIDM halos. We find that if the self-interactions are sufficiently strong, neither core stalling nor buoyancy are present, and a massive perturber will quickly sink all the way to the center of its host. In doing so, it gravitationally contracts the core, catalyzing a strongly accelerated core collapse. The reason why core dynamics are so different in SIDM halos is that self-interactions drive the halo's distribution function to a featureless exponential, removing any inflections or plateaus that are responsible for the dipole instability and core stalling in the case of CDM. We discuss implications of our finding for constraining the nature of dark matter by using observations of massive objects such as supermassive black holes (SMBHs), globular clusters, and nuclear star clusters in the central regions of galaxies.",

The central stellar velocity dispersion is one of the fundamental dynamical tracers of the total mass of galaxy subhalos, alongside luminosity and stellar mass. Because it reflects the gravitational potential, the stellar velocity dispersion is expected to be relatively insensitive to feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), a critical process that regulates the connection between other galaxy observables and subhalo mass. To examine the impact of AGN feedback, we analyze the VDFs from five EAGLE simulation runs, each adopting a different AGN feedback model: one \"standard\", two \"enhanced\", one \"reduced\", and one with no AGN feedback. We compute the stellar velocity dispersions of pressure-supported galaxies using member stellar particles, mimicking fiber spectroscopy. The VDFs from the standard and enhanced AGN feedback models show little difference. However, contrary to our initial expectation that the VDF shape would be largely insensitive to AGN feedback, the simulations with reduced and no AGN feedback show a significant excess of high velocity dispersion galaxies ($\\sigma_{*}$ > 200 km s$^{-1}$) and a deficit of low dispersion galaxies (100 < $\\sigma_{*}$ (km s$^{-1}$) < 200), compared to those with standard or enhanced AGN feedback. The presence of high velocity dispersion galaxies in the no-AGN model arises from enhanced central star formation, due to the absence of AGN-driven gas heating or expulsion. Our results demonstrate that the shape of the theoretical VDF is sensitive to the strength of AGN feedback. These predictions offer a theoretical benchmark for future observational studies of the galaxy velocity dispersion function using large-scale spectroscopic surveys.",

We selected a sample consisting of JO201 and JW100, undergoing ram-pressure stripping, and NGC 5291 and NGC 7252, formed through gravitational interactions, to investigate how different perturbation mechanisms influence dust content and star formation in extragalactic features. In both cases, star formation can be observed outside the main disks of the galaxies. We present new results of dust attenuation for JO201 and JW100, while for NGC 5291 and NGC 7252 we use results from our previous study, based on high-resolution observations obtained with the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope onboard AstroSat. Dust attenuation is determined from the ultraviolet continuum slope ($\\beta$) calculated using the FUV-NUV colour, and the star formation rates of the star-forming knots are corrected accordingly. It is seen that dust attenuation and dust-corrected SFR densities of the knots in the ram-pressure stripped tails of JO201 and JW100 are comparable to those in the collisional ring of the NGC 5291 system and the tidal tails of the NGC 7252 system. We conclude that, though the formation scenarios of the tails of JO201 and JW100, the NGC 5291 ring, and the NGC 7252 tails are different, their dust content and star formation activity are notably similar.",

While COMs were once expected to be efficiently destroyed under UV-irradiated conditions, detections in photodissociation regions (PDRs) have challenged this view. However, the mechanisms by which UV radiation contributes to their formation are still uncertain. Here, we present moderately resolved maps of simple and complex organic molecules at the UV-illuminated edge of the Horsehead nebula, obtained by combining ALMA and IRAM 30m single-dish observations at $\\sim 15^{\\prime\\prime}$ resolution. We analyze the spatial distribution of species such as C$^{17}$O, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, CH$_3$CN, and HC$_3$N. By incorporating previous C$^{17}$O and C$^{18}$O single-dish data as well as PdBI maps of H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH, we derive profiles of gas density, temperature, thermal pressure, and column densities of the organic species as a function of distance from the UV source. Our results show that most organic species$-$particularly H$_2$CO, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, and CH$_3$CN$-$exhibit enhanced column densities at the UV-illuminated edge compared to cloud interiors, possibly indicating efficient dust-grain surface chemistry driven by the diffusion of atomic C and radicals produced via photodissociation of CO and CH$_3$OH, as supported by recent laboratory experiments. The exceptions, HC$_3$N and CH$_3$OH, can be attributed to inefficient formation on dust grains and ineffective non-thermal desorption into the gas phase, respectively. Additionally, contributions from gas-phase hydrocarbon photochemistry, possibly seeded by grain-surface products, cannot be ruled out. Further chemical modeling is needed to confirm the efficiency of these pathways for the studied species, which could have important implications for other cold, UV-irradiated environments such as protoplanetary disks.",

Accepted by A&A, Final version Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The C-MetaLL project has provided homogeneous spectroscopic abundances of 290 Classical Cepheids (DCEPs) for which we have the intensity-averaged magnitudes in multiple optical and near-infrared (NIR) bands, periods, pulsation modes, and Gaia parallaxes. Our goal is to derive updated period-Wesenheit-metallicity (PWZ) relations using the largest and most homogeneous metallicity sample ever used for such analyses, covering a range of $-1.3<$[Fe/H]$<+0.3$ dex. We computed several optical and NIR Wesenheit magnitudes using 275 DCEPs with reliable parallaxes, by applying a robust photometric parallax technique, which simultaneously fits all parameters -- including the global Gaia parallax counter-correction -- and handles outliers without data rejection. We find a stronger metallicity dependence ($\\gamma \\approx -0.5$ mag/dex in optical, $-0.4$ mag/dex in NIR) than recent literature reports. Gaia parallax zero-point conter-corrections ($\\epsilon$) vary smoothly across bands, with an average value of $\\sim$10 $\\mu$as, aligning with previous determinations. Applying our PWZ relations to LMC Cepheids yields distances generally consistent within $1\\sigma$ with geometric estimates. The choice of reddening law has a negligible impact, while using only fundamental-mode pulsators significantly increases the uncertainties. Including $\\alpha$-element corrections increases $|\\gamma|$ and reduces $\\epsilon$. However, we find statistically consistent $\\gamma$ values with the literature, particularly for the key Wesenheit magnitude in the HST bands, by restricting the sample to the brighter (i.e. closer) objects, or by including only pulsators with $-0.7<$[Fe/H]$<$0.2 dex. Our results hint at a large $\\gamma$ or a non-linear dependence on metallicity of DCEP luminosities at the metal-poor end, which is difficult to quantify with the precision of parallaxes of the present dataset.",

The product of the V-band geometric albedo, $p_V$, with the physical cross-section of the nucleus is $0.22 \\pm 0.07$ km$^{2}$, which corresponds to an effective radius of $1.3 \\pm 0.2$ km if assuming a comet-like albedo $p_{V} = 0.04$. This size is in agreement with an independent estimate based on the reported nongravitational acceleration and activity of the interstellar object. If the measured photometric variations are solely due to the rotation of an aspherical nucleus, the axis ratio must be $2:1$ or greater, and the rotation period $\\gtrsim\\!1$ hr. Leveraging the range of covered phase angles, we identified a significant opposition surge of $\\sim\\!0.2$ mag with a width of $3^{\\circ} \\pm 1^{\\circ}$, which may include concurrent contributions from orbital plane crossing and tail projection, and determined a linear phase slope of $0.026 \\pm 0.006$ mag degree$^{-1}$ for the coma dust. Compared to the preperihelion brightening trend, 3I faded more rapidly on the outbound leg, following an activity index of $4.5 \\pm 0.3$, not unusual in the context of solar system comets. This activity asymmetry is further corroborated by a postperihelion coma surface brightness profile that is significantly shallower than its preperihelion counterpart.

Although intimately related, analyses primarily use one or the other. We introduce a framework for estimating the power spectrum using the second-order structure function without applying Fourier transforms -- enabling one to take advantage of the real-space structure function calculations. We validate and showcase this method, comparing it to classical Fourier power spectrum estimates determined from analytical calculations, fractional Brownian motion, turbulence simulations, and space-physics and astrophysical observations of turbulence. We show that this method is able to robustly obtain the expected power law behaviour where we use turbulence ranges as test-cases.",

All the code used for the simulations and figures is available at this https URL Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The discovery of interstellar interlopers such as 1I/`Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov, and 3I/ATLAS have highlighted the necessity of understanding the dynamical pathways that eject small bodies from planetary systems into hyperbolic trajectories. In this paper we examine the orbital elements of particles in the restricted three-body problem prior to and post scattering onto hyperbolic trajectories by massive perturbers. Building on previous work, we calculate closed-form -- but approximate -- analytic criteria that map pre- to post-encounter orbital elements. An application of these equations demonstrates that ejection occurs most efficiently when the orbital eccentricity of the massless test particle exceeds a minimum threshold, $e\\gtrsim0.4$. The primary driver of the final eccentricity is the component of the perturber-centric velocity projected along the direction of motion of the perturber. These analytic criteria are then benchmarked and validated against numerical simulations which demonstrate that they provide a reasonably good zeroth-order approximation for ejection behavior. However, system-specific cases will generally require numerical simulations in addition to this analytic construction. The methodology is applied to (i) the solar system and exoplanetary systems (ii) $\\beta$ Pictoris and (iii) HR 8799 to evaluate the pre-scattering orbits of ejected particles. This method provides a transparent and computationally efficient tool for identifying orbits within a given system from which interstellar objects are efficiently ejected via a single scattering event from a massive perturber.",

Allen 21 Pages, 5 figures, revision submitted to ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) In SEP events, velocity dispersion (VD) is characterized by the earlier arrival of faster, higher-energy particles relative to slower ones, assuming negligible acceleration time and transport effects. The \"Labor Day event\" at Parker Solar Probe (PSP) on 2022 September 5 provided a unique arrival profile, in which the medium energy (~ few MeV) particles arrive earlier than both lower and higher energy particles. This created a so-called \"nose\" structure in the intensity spectrogram formed by measurements from the two energetic particle instruments, EPI-Lo and EPI-Hi, of the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (ISOIS) suite. Unlike typical VD, the delayed arrival of higher energy particles compared to medium energy particles, i.e., the \"inverse velocity arrival\" (IVA), could be caused by various acceleration, transport, and instrumental effects, including shock acceleration. By applying a new method based on the contour-line of the intensity, we found 14 IVA events in the ISOIS observations up to the end of 2024. Several parameters that may modify velocity dispersion characteristics are further explored including the spacecraft radial distance, the speed of corresponding CMEs and shocks, the angle between the shock normal and the upstream magnetic field, and the spacecraft magnetic footpoint longitudinal separation from the flare location. The energy of the early arriving particles, i.e., the nose energy, can be grouped into low (L, <0.5 MeV), medium(M, 0.5 - 5 MeV), and high(H, >5 MeV) categories. Most (11/14) of the IVA events have medium nose energies. This SEP list provides ingredients for examination of shock acceleration in the inner heliosphere, and the existence of IVA events sheds new light on the acceleration and propagation of SEPs.",

Almost all GLE events are associated with sustained gamma-ray emission (SGRE) from the Sun because the latter require >300 MeV protons that are readily present during GLEs. Here we report on the 2024 June 8 GLE event, which has the distinction of not being associated with an SGRE event. All the associated phenomena typical of SGRE events were present: a fast and wide CME, a major solar flare, and an intense type II radio bursts that extend from the metric to kilometric wavelength domains. There was a data gap of ~51 min, but the SGRE is expected to last for hours. We suggest the east-west asymmetry in the flow of energetic particles from the shock is likely to be the reason for the lack of SGRE emission.",

Decin RAS Techniques and Instruments, Volume 5, 2026, rzag009 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars significantly contribute to the chemical composition of the universe. In their outflows, complex chemistry takes place, which critically depends on the local temperature. Therefore, if we want to accurately model the AGB environment, we need accurate cooling rates. The CO molecule is abundant in AGB outflows, and has a dipole moment, which enables it to cool through emission from its rotational transitions. We therefore expect it to significantly contribute to cooling in this environment, even at low temperatures ($10$ K $\\leqslant T\\leqslant 3000$ K). Currently, CO cooling rates are available for ISM-like conditions, which encompasses a different parameter regime, with generally lower densities and velocity gradients, compared to AGB winds. Therefore, these ISM cooling rates might not be applicable to the AGB regime. In this paper, we compute CO cooling rates for hydrodynamics simulations of AGB outflows. To evaluate the net cooling rate, we calculate the energy level distribution of CO self-consistently, using the non Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium (NLTE) line radiative transfer code Magritte. We verify whether already existing CO cooling rate prescriptions for the interstellar medium (ISM) are applicable for this regime. We noticed minor differences between these prescriptions and our calculated cooling rates in general. However, when used far outside their originally intended parameter regimes, significant differences occur. Therefore, we propose a new CO cooling rate prescription for the AGB environment and we study how the computed cooling rate varies depending on input parameters.",

Blackford Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We presented the first high-precision, detailed photometric analysis of four W Ursae Majoris (W UMa)-type contact binaries, Linear 10772300, Linear 11150338, Linear 20372537 and DM Cir. In addition to ground-based multiband photometric observations, data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) were employed for the analysis of the DM Cir system. New ephemeris and linear fit to the O-C diagrams were derived using extracted times of minima and additional literature. The light curve modeling was performed using the PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) Python code and the BSN application, employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. In each systems, the two stellar components exhibited minimal temperature differences ($\\Delta T<150$ K), confirming efficient energy exchange within their common convective envelopes. Absolute parameters were estimated using the Gaia Data Release 3 (Gaia DR3) parallax and astrophysical equations. Based on effective temperatures and component masses, two systems were classified as W-subtype systems, while others belonged to the A-subtype. We computed the initial masses of the primary ($M_{1i}$) and secondary ($M_{2i}$) components for four target systems using a method based on the observational properties of overluminous secondary components. We found initial primary masses in the range 0.6-1.0$M_\\odot$ and initial secondary masses in the range 0.9-1.7$M_\\odot$ with mass loss $<1.0M_{\\odot}$. We investigated the relative energy transfer rates ($U_{1}$ and $U_{2}$) and nuclear luminosities ($L_{10}$ and $L_{20}$) based on the physical parameters of 411 W UMa-type contact binaries, including the four systems analyzed in this study, through wide range of mass ratios. The results for all systems provided a comprehensive view of energy transfer behavior throughout different evolutionary stages of contact binaries.",

It is still unclear how gravitational stratification affects the kink frequency in curved coronal loops. This work aims to investigate the effect of gravitational stratification on the frequency of kink oscillations in curved coronal loops and discuss their seismological potential. We conduct numerical computations within the ideal MHD framework to study different kink polarizations and harmonics in a curved, gravitationally stratified coronal loop. The oscillation frequencies derived from the Lagrangian displacement are compared with the WKB approximation. For the vertically polarized fundamental mode, the oscillation frequency deviates from the WKB approximation by about 18\\% in the current numerical setup. Nevertheless, the oscillation frequency closely matches the local Alfvén frequency near the loop apex. On the other hand, the frequency of the horizontally polarized fundamental mode exhibits only a 7\\% deviation in our current model from the WKB approximation and closely matches the local Alfvén frequency near one quarter of the loop. For the first overtones, the frequencies for both polarizations can be well described by the WKB approximation. The frequency of vertically polarized fundamental kink modes can be predicted by the local Alfvén frequency near the loop apex. In contrast, the WKB approximation remains highly reliable for estimating the frequency of horizontally polarized fundamental modes and first overtones, which is also well described by the local Alfvén frequency near one quarter of the loop. These results therefore pave the way for spatially dependent coronal seismology, enabling, e.g., the probing of magnetic field strength at different locations along a coronal loop.",

Our analysis reveals that V515 And resides within the period gap, with the detection of its orbital period of 2.73116 h. Additionally, we confirm the earlier findings of the spin and beat periods to be 465.4721 s and 488.6067 s, respectively. The time-resolved timing analysis reveals that V515 And undergoes changes in its accretion geometry, not only between different TESS sectors but also within individual sector observations. The system exhibits a transition in the dominant accretion mode, switching between disc-fed and stream-fed accretion. In the TESS light curve, we identify two successive outburst-like episodes, each persisting for roughly a day and reaching peak luminosities of $2.7\\times10^{33}$ and $1.9\\times10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Our analysis suggests that these bursts belong to the recently proposed class of micronovae.

Fuentes Submitted to Planetary Science Journal, comments welcome! Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The excitation and damping mechanisms for oscillation modes of gas giant planets are undetermined. We show that differential rotation may greatly enhance convective viscosity in giant planets, resulting in damping times of $t_{\\rm damp} \\sim 10^5-10^6 \\, {\\rm years}$ for f modes and low-order p modes. Radiative diffusion damps p modes on time scales of $t_{\\rm damp} \\sim 10^3-10^7 \\, {\\rm years}$. While the lethargic convective motions cannot effectively excite f mode or p modes, storms driven by condensation of water and/or silicates may play a role. High-order p modes are most effectively excited by cometary/asteroid impacts. Applying these calculations to solar system planets, water storms, rock storms, and impacts may all contribute to exciting the observed f modes amplitudes of Saturn via ring seismology. Similar f mode amplitudes with fractional gravitational perturbations of $\\delta \\Phi/\\Phi \\sim 10^{-10}-10^{-9}$ are expected for Jupiter and Uranus, apart from their lowest $\\ell$ f modes which could have larger gravitational perturbations of $\\delta \\Phi/\\Phi \\sim 10^{-7}$. Rock storms may contribute to mode driving in Jupiter, while water storms are more important for Uranus. The highest-amplitude p modes are predicted to have periods of $\\sim$10-30 minutes, with surface velocities of $\\sim$10 cm/s for Jupiter and Saturn, and $\\sim$1 cm/s for Uranus. These oscillation modes may be detectable with radial velocity measurements, ring seismology, or spacecraft Doppler tracking. However, both the damping and excitation physics are uncertain by orders of magnitude, so more careful examination of the relevant physics is required for robust estimates.",

Woodward Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The power spectrum of light curves from satellites like CoRoT and TESS of massive main-sequence stars show stochastic low-frequency (SLF) variability. To investigate the origin of this phenomenon, we conducted high-resolution 3D hydrodynamic \\texttt{PPMstar} simulations of a non-rotating \\unit{25}{\\Msun} zero-age main sequence star, modeling 95\\% of the stellar structure with both a core and a thin outer envelope convection zone. The outer envelope convection zone was implemented through modification of the opacity model, shifting the Fe opacity bump inward and enhancing its amplitude for computational feasibility. The luminosity power spectrum from our primary simulation (M424) exhibits qualitative and quantitative characteristics similar to observed SLF variability, with a $\\approx2$-dex difference between high- and low-frequency power. The spectrum displays distinct features attributable to internal gravity wave (IGW) eigenmodes. To isolate the contributions of different stellar regions, we performed numerical experiments with suppressed core convection, envelope convection and envelope-only configurations. The comparative analysis demonstrates that outer envelope convection alone produces significantly less low-frequency power than the full-star configuration. In our simulations the outer envelope convection zone excites at its inner boundary a rich IGW eigenmode spectrum in the layer just below. In an otherwise identical simulation where the core convection is not driven by heating, the SLF spectrum is remarkably similar and the integrated power is reduced by only 10\\%, suggesting that the envelope convection is the dominant contributor to SLF power spectrum. The IGW spectral characteristics depend on the complete stellar stratification, demonstrating that interior structure could influence observable surface variability.",

The system is found to be an extreme low mass ratio system (q = 0.197) with high inclination (i = 84.5 deg), moderate degree of contact (27%) and near equal temperatures of the components. Period analysis of survey photometry spanning over 6300 days reveals no significant change. Although the system does not demonstrate a significant O'Connell effect there are a number of other markers strongly suggesting the system is chromospherically active. Orbital analysis indicates that the system is stable and not a merger candidate.",

Lyon Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We present GAMERA-OP (Orthogonal-Plus), a three-dimensional finite-volume magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) solver for orthogonal curvilinear geometries. The solver advances magnetic fields using constrained transport to preserve $\\nabla\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathbf{B}=0$ to machine precision and employs geometry-consistent high-order reconstruction with an enhanced Partial Donor Cell method (e-PDM) that accounts for geometry curvature. Flexible numerics include various numerical fluxes and time integrators. In axial symmetric coordinates, angular momentum are preserved to round-off, and a ring-averaging treatment near the axis relaxes CFL constraints while maintaining divergence-free magnetic fields. Optional capabilities include the semi-relativistic (Boris) correction, background-field splitting, and an anisotropic MHD formulation. Rewritten in C, the code adopts a modular design that simplifies case setup and facilitates the addition of physics modules and coupling to other first-principles codes. Standard benchmarks across multiple geometries verify the code's high accuracy, low numerical diffusion, and robust handling of coordinate singularities and rotating flows. GAMERA-OP provides a practical, high-order framework for space and astrophysical plasma applications where orthogonal curvilinear coordinates and exact angular-momentum conservation are advantageous.",

The code simultaneously resolves the hydrodynamic equations for complex equations of state (EoS) and implicit radiation transport under the flux-limited diffusion approximation. Written in Fortran and parallelized via the Message Passing Interface. Guangqi supports analytic hydrogen and helium EoS under the assumption of local thermal and chemical equilibrium. The framework is compatible with both Cartesian and spherical-polar geometries -- utilizing non-uniform grid spacing -- and incorporates static (SMR) and adaptive mesh refinement to optimize computational efficiency. To address the inherent challenges of angular momentum conservation in spherical-polar coordinates, we implement a robust and consistent \"passive scalar angular momentum algorithm\" (PSAMA). Domain decomposition is managed through both Z-order and Hilbert space-filling curves to ensure scalability. The code has been rigorously verified against a suite of standard benchmarks and newly designed test cases specifically intended to diagnose the non-linear coupling between gas dynamics, intricate EoS, radiation transport, and angular momentum conservation.",

Murray ESO White Paper on Intensity Interferometry 4 pages Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) In this whitepaper, we outline how recent technological advances and ongoing developments open qualitatively new science opportunities in cosmology, fundamental physics, and quantum astrophysics. First, intensity interferometry can contribute to one of the most foundational observables in cosmology: the expansion rate of the Universe. Its angular resolution allows it to resolve the angular extent of extragalactic objects such as supernovae or quasars; combined with a physical scale local to the source, this yields an angular diameter distance and hence a 'Hubble diagram'. Second, the nature of dark matter can be probed via the astrometric lensing signatures of tiny dark matter halos. Third, intensity interferometry gives direct access to second-order coherence properties of astrophysical emission, opening a window onto genuinely quantum aspects of astrophysical light.",

Comments are welcome Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We present a feasibility study exploring the implementation of optical interferometry and speckle techniques with the 1.3-m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope (DFOT) at ARIES, which is currently dedicated to photometric observations. Using the sCMOS camera as the DFOT backend, we perform interferometric speckle observations of several binary stars. Standard Speckle Interferometry (SI) algorithms are applied to analyze the recorded data. While this study does not aim to achieve the diffraction limit of DFOT or address a full science-driven resolution case, it serves as a crucial testbed for instrumentation, data acquisition, and analysis of Speckles with DFOT. Notably, we successfully identify and correct tracking-related positional errors in the observed binary systems, demonstrating the viability of the approach. These results provide strong motivation for more systematic observations and future implementation of optical interferometry techniques at meter-class telescopes.",

It executed two touchdowns to collect the surface and subsurface materials, one close to the crater created by an artificial impactor. The onboard camera system, Optical Navigation Camera (ONC), with two wide-angle cameras and one narrow-angle camera with seven color filters, was crucial for mapping geomorphology and composition such as hydrated minerals during navigation and scientific observation. More than 8,300 images revealed Ryugu's spinning-top shape and boulder-covered surface. However, most high-resolution images captured during descent/touchdown operations lacked precise location data and camera position/orientation information. Image geometry was refined using photogrammetric bundle adjustment. This method enabled the refinement of all high-resolution images captured during descent/touchdown operations. Furthermore, map-projected GeoTIFF images in GIS format containing geographic metadata were created for all ONC images, and these were integrated to construct global and regional mosaic maps. To facilitate scientific research on Ryugu, these refined image geometry information, maps, and mosaics are publicly available via this https URL",

Villanueva Accepted for publication in the Astronomical Journal Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We present our analysis of how the detectability of carbon dioxide (CO2) on an Earth-like planet varies with respect to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), wavelength, and molecular abundance. Using the Bayesian Analysis for Remote Biosignature Identification on exoEarths (BARBIE) methodology, we can inform the optimal long-wavelength cut-off for the future Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) coronagraph. We test 25 evenly-spaced 20% bandpasses between 0.8-2.0{\\mu}m, and simulate data spanning a range of SNRs and molecular abundance to analyze the relationship between wavelength and detectability for different planetary archetypes. We examine abundance levels from varying Earth epochs and a Venus-like archetype to investigate how detectability would change throughout the evolution of a rocky planet. Here, we present our results on the planetary conditions and technological requirements to strongly detect CO2. In addition, we analyze the degeneracy of CO2 with carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), and water (H2O). We determine that any abundance of CO does not achieve strong detections and that CH4 and H2O play a pivotal role in the ability to detect CO2. We conclude that the optimal long-wavelength cut-off for the Habitable Worlds Observatory coronagraph should be 1.68{\\mu}m.",

Mulders Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Substructures such as rings, gaps, and cavities are commonly observed in protoplanetary discs and are thought to play a key role in dust evolution and planet formation. However, a fraction of the extended discs (68% dust radii > 30 AU) in nearby star-forming regions remain unresolved, leaving their substructure content uncertain and thereby limiting our understanding of dust evolution and the initial conditions for planet formation across the full disc population. We aim to investigate the presence of substructures in previously unresolved, extended discs to assess whether all extended protoplanetary discs in the Solar neighbourhood exhibit substructures. We present new high-resolution ($\\sim$0.12\") ALMA Band 6 continuum observations at 1.33 mm of 26 previously unresolved, extended discs within 200 pc, completing the high-resolution sample of extended discs in Taurus, Ophiuchus, Chamaeleon, Lupus, Upper Scorpius, Upper Centaurus-Lupus and Lower Centaurus-Crux. We analyse radial intensity profiles using Frankenstein and Galario to detect substructures. Seventeen discs show clear substructures, while nine appear compact and structureless, smooth or ambiguous due to inclination or possible binarity/late-stage infall. We detect $^{12}$CO J=2-1 emission in 15 discs, with extended emission in four. Combined with literature data, our complete sample of 730 protoplanetary discs reveals that nearly all extended discs exhibit substructures, $\\sim$91% detected in the full sample, and up to $\\sim$98% when correcting for high-inclination systems where substructures may be hidden. Substructures are a near-universal feature of extended protoplanetary discs. They are more commonly detected in larger, massive discs and around higher-mass stars, and structured discs retain their dust mass over time. This supports the scenario in which dust traps, possibly induced by giant planets, shape disc morphologies.",

Coordinated simultaneous submission with independent paper by Rojas et al Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We present the discovery of TIC-65910228 b / NGTS-38 b, a giant exoplanet with a radius of $1.081\\pm0.047$ R$_\\text{J}$ and a mass of $4.78_{-0.37}^{+0.40}$ M$_\\text{J}$ on a long-period ($180.52791\\pm0.00038$ day), moderately eccentric ($e=0.308\\pm0.011$) orbit transiting a bright (V=$10.230\\pm0.020$ mag) metal rich ([Fe/H]=$0.33\\pm0.09$, 'dex') F6V-F7V type host star. The planet was initially detected from a single transit in TESS Sector 33. A photometric monitoring campaign of 228 nights with NGTS detected a transit egress of the planet, which together with spectroscopic radial velocity monitoring with CORALIE and HARPS identified an orbital period of ~180.5,d. These radial velocity measurements also showed the mass of the companion to be planetary. Additional transit observations coordinated by the TESS follow-up observing program allowed further confirmation and refinement of this period. With its relatively cool equilibrium temperature of $458\\pm11$,K, NGTS-38 b joins a small but growing population of well characterised transiting warm-Jupiters and has one of the longest periods of any discovered to date. The target is situated in the LOPS2 field of the upcoming PLATO mission which will allow for greater refinement of the system parameters and potential for the discovery of additional companions too small and/or too long-period to be seen by TESS or NGTS. NGTS-38 b's bright host star and wide orbital separation make it an attractive target for further study, including potential measurement of its spin-orbit alignment or targeted exomoon/ring searches.",

      "abstract": "How hard is dust in debris disks? Tobias Stein, Alexander V. Krivov, Torsten Löhne Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Observational appearance of debris disks is largely controlled by collisional grinding of their dust grains. However, the mechanical strength of dust at sizes in the micrometer to millimeter range is poorly known. Recent studies suggested that dust particles in the Solar system might have a higher critical fragmentation energy $Q_{D}^*$ value than previously anticipated. Another recent study considered the Fomalhaut debris disk and found lower $Q_{D}^*$ values to provide better fits to the data. In order to constrain the mechanical strength of dust, we investigate collisional evolution of debris disks with $Q_{D}^*$ prescriptions differing by $\\sim 3$ orders of magnitude. We find that, above a certain threshold $Q_{D}^*$ value, the disk's collisional evolution is dominated by rebounding -- rather than disruptive or cratering -- collisions. Rebounding (a.k.a. bouncing) collisions are those in which both impactors survive, being only slightly eroded and producing fragments that only carry a minor fraction of their mass. We show that disks dominated by rebounding collisions would have brightness profiles increasing outward outside the parent belt. Since such profiles are not observed, this places an upper limit on how hard the debris dust is allowed to be in order not to violate the observations. We derive an approximate analytic expression for this limit: $Q_{D}^* \\approx (1/8) v_{K}^2(r)$ for grains close to the radiation pressure blowout size, where $v_{K}$ in the Keplerian circular speed at a distance $r$ from the star. This implies $Q_{D}^* \\lesssim 10^{9...10} \\,\\hbox{erg}\\,\\hbox{g}^{-1}$ for micrometer-sized grains in typical debris disks. Even though rebounding collisions are not expected to affect debris disk evolution significantly, we emphasize that these collisions are actually much more frequent than disruptive and cratering ones in all debris disks.",

Warm Jupiters are excellent case studies for the investigation of giant planet internal structures and formation theories. However, the sample of long-period transiting giants is still small today for a better understanding of this population. Aims. Starting from a single transit found in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data, we confirm the planetary nature of the signal and measure its orbital parameters, mass, and radius. We put this system in the context of long-period giant transiting planets and analyzed the viability to sustain atmospheric or dynamical follow-up. Methods. We carried out a spectroscopic follow-up using FEROS and PLATOSpec to obtain precise radial velocities. We added a photometric follow-up with HATPI and Observatoire Moana to obtain a more precise estimate of the orbital period. We derived the orbital and physical parameters through a joint analysis of this data. Results. We report the discovery and characterization of TIC65910228b, a transiting warm Jupiter with a mass of $4.554 \\pm 0.255$ $M_J$ and a radius of $1.088 \\pm 0.061$ $R_J$, orbiting an evolved F-type star every $\\sim 180.52$ days in an eccentric orbit ($e = 0.25 \\pm 0.04$). Conclusions. This planet joins a still under-explored population of long-period ($P > 100$) massive ($M_p > 4$ $M_J$) transiting giant planets, being one of the few with a mild eccentricity. This target is a nice example of the potential of single-transit events to populate this region of the parameter space.",

Since cubic ice recently become experimentally accessible from a low-density gas hydrate precursor [1, 2], it has been possible to measure its density as a function of temperature in the whole thermodynamic range of metastability. We found strong analogies with respect to the other ice I polytype, i.e., hexagonal ice Ih [3], including the presence of a negative thermal expansion behavior at low temperature. Based on these results, a new enthalpy calculation quantifies the metastable nature of the cubic form and, consequently its inaccessibility from a \"normal\" ice Ih precursor.",
