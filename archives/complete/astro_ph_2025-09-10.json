Comments are welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Recent imaging of supermassive black holes by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has relied on exhaustive parameter-space searches, matching observations to large, precomputed libraries of theoretical models. As observational data become increasingly precise, the limitations of this computationally expensive approach grow more acute, creating a pressing need for more efficient methods. In this work, we present $\\texttt{Jipole}$, an automatically differentiable (AD), $\\texttt{ipole}$-based code for radiative transfer in curved spacetimes, designed to compute image gradients with respect to underlying model parameters. These gradients quantify how parameter changes-such as the black hole's spin or the observer's inclination-affect the image, enabling more efficient parameter estimation and reducing the number of required images. We validate $\\texttt{Jipole}$ against $\\texttt{ipole}$ in two analytical tests and then compare pixel-wise intensity derivatives from AD with those from finite-difference methods. We then demonstrate the utility of these gradients by performing parameter recovery for an analytical model using a conjugate gradient optimizer in three increasingly complex cases for the injected image: ideal, blurred, and blurred with added noise. In most cases, high-accuracy fits are obtained in only a few optimization steps, failing only in cases with extremely low signal-to-noise ratios and large blurring size kernels. These results highlight the potential of AD-based methods to accelerate robust, high-fidelity model-data comparisons in current and future black hole imaging efforts.",

Font, Milton Ruiz High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Following a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, the transient remnant is often a fast-spinning, differentially rotating, magnetised hypermassive neutron star (HMNS). This object is prone to the magnetorotational instability (MRI) which drives magnetohydrodynamic turbulence that significantly influences the HMNS global dynamics. A key consequence of turbulence is the outward transport of angular momentum which impacts the remnant's stability and lifetime. Most numerical simulations of BNS mergers are unable to resolve the MRI due to its inherently small wavelength. To overcome this limitation, subgrid models have been proposed to capture the effects of unresolved small-scale physics in terms of large-scale quantities. We present the first implementation of our MHD-Instability-Induced Turbulence (MInIT) model in global Newtonian simulations of MRI-sensitive, differentially rotating, magnetised neutron stars. Here, we show that by adding the corresponding turbulent stress tensors to the momentum equation, MInIT successfully reproduces the angular momentum transport in neutron stars driven by small-scale turbulence.",

Taylor, Bence Bécsy, Anna-Malin Lemke, Andrea Mitridate, Nihan Pol Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) With pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) having observed a gravitational wave background (GWB) at nanohertz frequencies, the focus of the field is shifting towards determining and characterizing its origin. While the primary candidate is a population of GW-emitting supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), many other cosmological processes could produce a GWB with similar spectral properties as have been measured. One key argument to help differentiate an SMBHB GWB from a cosmologically sourced one is its level of anisotropy; a GWB sourced by a finite population will likely exhibit greater anisotropy than a cosmological GWB through finite source effects (``shot noise'') and potentially large-scale structure. Current PTA GWB anisotropy detection methods often use the frequentist PTA optimal statistic for its fast estimation of pulsar pair correlations and relatively low computational overhead compared to spatially-correlated Bayesian analyses. However, there are critical limitations with the status quo approach. In this paper, we improve this technique by incorporating three recent advancements: accounting for covariance between pulsar pairwise estimates of correlated GWB power; the per-frequency optimal statistic to dissect the GWB across the spectrum; and constructing null-hypothesis statistical distributions that include cosmic variance. By combining these methods, our new pipeline can localize GWB anisotropies to specific frequencies, through which anisotropy detection prospects -- while impacted by cosmic variance -- are shown to improve in our simulations from a $p$-value of $\\sim0.2$ in a broadband search to $\\sim0.01$ in the per-frequency search. Our methods are already incorporated in community-available code and ready to deploy on forthcoming PTA datasets.",

Mulryne Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this work, we revisit and evaluate new source terms which contribute to the induced gravitational wave background. We study their respective contributions to the stochastic gravitational wave background by computing their spectral densities in a radiation-dominated universe. These terms appear at third order in cosmological perturbation theory, however, their correlations with primordial gravitational waves are non-trivial and appear at the same order as so-called scalar induced and scalar-tensor induced gravitational waves. We find that these gravitational wave sources suppress the spectral density at the scales we consider. Furthermore, similarly to scalar-tensor source terms at second order, we find that some terms are enhanced when the input primordial power spectrum of scalar fluctuations is not sufficiently peaked. Hence, where possible, we show that under certain limits the integrands of these terms diverge in the UV sector.",

Callister, Christian Adamcewicz, Zoheyr Doctor, Vicky Kalogera High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The detection of gravitational waves has brought to light a population of binary black holes that merge within a Hubble time. Multiple formation channels can contribute to this population, making it difficult to definitively associate particular population features with underlying stellar physics. Black hole spins are considered an important discriminator between various channels, but they are less well-measured than masses, making conclusive astrophysical statements using spins difficult thus far. In this paper, we consider the distribution of the effective inspiral spin $\\chi_{\\rm eff}$ -- a quantity much better measured than individual component spins. We show that non-Gaussian features like skewness, asymmetry about zero, and multimodality can naturally arise in the $\\chi_{\\rm eff}$ distribution when multiple channels contribute to the population. Searching for such features, we find signs of skewness and asymmetry already in the current catalogs, but no statistically significant signs of bimodality. These features provide robust evidence for the presence of a subpopulation with spins preferentially aligned to the binary's orbital angular momentum; and we conservatively estimate the fraction of this subpopulation to be at least $12 \\% - 17\\%$ (at $90\\%$ credibility). Our models do not find an excess of non-spinning systems and instead find that at least $\\sim 20 \\%$ of the binaries have some degree of negative $\\chi_{\\rm eff}$. The data also suggest that, if preferentially aligned mergers form a significant fraction of the population, they must have small spins.",

The leading approach to do this is the effective field theory of dark energy (EFTofDE), which can describe general Horndeski-type theories with a small number of observationally accessible time-dependent functions. However, the EFTofDE primarily works for linear perturbations, and extending it to obtain a fully non-linear description of DE theories, which is critical for theories with screening mechanisms, is challenging. In this paper, we present a general method for reconstructing the non-linear DE Lagrangian from the background expansion history and certain linear-perturbation quantities, building upon the EFTofDE framework. Using numerical examples, we demonstrate that this method is applicable to a wide range of single-scalar-field dark energy and modified gravity theories, including quintessence, scalar-tensor theory, $k$-essence, and generalized cubic Galileon with shift symmetry. For each of these theories, we discuss the validity of the method and factors affecting its results. While this method involves solving differential equations, we find that the initial conditions are not important for quintessence, scalar-tensor theory and $k$-essence, while for shift-symmetric cubic Galileon, the generic tracker solution can help transform differential equations into algebraic equations. This offers a useful framework to connect cosmological observations at the background and linear-perturbation levels to the underlying non-linear dynamics of dark energy, and will enable cosmological simulations to analyze and examine DE theories systematically and in much greater detail.",

By modeling such components as perfect fluids, a cosmologically relevant bulk viscous pressure emerges for dark matter particle masses in the range of $1\\,\\text{eV} - 10\\,\\text{eV}$ keeping thermal equilibrium with the radiation. Such a transient bulk viscosity introduces significant effects in the expansion rate near the matter-radiation equality (redshift $z_{\\text{eq}} \\sim 3400$) and at late times (leading to a higher inferred value of the Hubble constant $H_0$). We use the recent DESI DR2 BAO data to place an upper bound on the free parameter of the model $\\tau_\\text{eq}$ which represents the time scale in which each component follows its own internal perfect fluid dynamics until thermalization occurs.

A key next step towards characterizing this signal and identifying its origin is to map the sky distribution of its power. Several strategies have been proposed to reconstruct this distribution using PTA data. In this work, we compare these different strategies to determine which one is best suited to detect GWB anisotropies of different topologies. We find that, for both localized and large-scale anisotropies, reconstruction methods based on pixel and radiometer maps are the most promising. However, in both scenarios, even the optimistically large anisotropic signals discussed in this work remain challenging to detect with near-future PTA sensitivities. For example, we find that for a GWB hotspot contributing to $80\\%$ of the GWB power in the second frequency bin, detection probabilities reach at most $\\mathcal{O}(10\\%)$ for a PTA with noise properties comparable with the ones of the upcoming IPTA third data release. Finally, we consider the fundamental limitations that cosmic variance poses to these kinds of searches by deriving the smallest deviations from isotropy that could be detected by an idealized PTA with no experimental or pulsar noise.",

Code available at this https URL Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We utilize the Magneticum suite of hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the formation and evolution of cosmic voids from $z = 5.04$ to present day, using cold dark matter and (sub-) halo tracers in high-density samples. This includes the evolution of their global properties, such as size, shape, inner density, and average density, as well as their radial density profiles. Our results provide several key conclusions for void analyses in modern surveys. We demonstrate that a relative size framework is required, mitigating methodological selection effects and revealing the true physical evolution of densities around halo-defined voids. This necessity arises from our findings that a void's properties are more fundamentally tied to its rank within its contemporary population than to its absolute size. Using this framework, we show that the evolution of halo voids stabilizes at redshifts below $z \\simeq 1$, driven primarily by cosmic expansion rather than ongoing halo formation. We further find that the matter evolution around these stable voids is remarkably well-described by linear growth theory, with deviations appearing as non-linear growth on small scales and suppressed growth in the largest voids, potentially driven by the influence of dark energy. This late-time stability and the predictable evolution confirm voids as pristine laboratories for probing the nature of dark energy with upcoming surveys.",

Shahbandeh 32 pages, 10 figures, submitted to ApJ Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) In this paper, the suitability of fast-declining Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as cosmological standard candles is examined utilizing a Hubble Flow sample of 43 of these objects observed by the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP). We confirm previous suggestions that fast-declining SNe Ia offer a viable method for estimating distances to early-type galaxies when the color-stretch parameter, $s_{BV}$, is used as a measure of the light curve shape. As a test, we employ the Tripp (1998) method, which models the absolute magnitude at maximum as a function of light curve shape and color. We calibrate the sample using 12 distance moduli based on published Infrared Surface Brightness Fluctuations to derive a value of the Hubble constant that is in close agreement with the value found by Uddin et al. (2024), using the same methodology, but with the full sample of CSP SNe Ia. We also develop a new and simple method of estimating the distances of fast decliners only based on their colors at maximum (and not light curve shape) and find that it has a precision similar to the Tripp method. This \"Color\" technique is a powerful tool that is unique to fast-declining SNe Ia. We show that the colors of the fast decliners at maximum light are strongly affected by photospheric temperature differences and not solely due to dust extinction, and provide a physical rationale for this effect.",

We present a Bayesian hierarchical model that simultaneously fits individual cluster parameters and the underlying population distribution, providing estimates of the population-averaged pressure profile and the intrinsic scatter, as well as accurate pressure estimates for individual objects. We introduce a highly flexible, low-covariance, and interpretable parameterization of the pressure profile based on restricted cubic splines. We model the scatter properly accounting for outliers, and we incorporate corrections for beam and transfer function, as required for SZ data. Our model is applied to the largest non-stacked sample of individual cluster radial profiles, extracted from SPT+Planck Compton-y maps. This is a complete sample of 55 clusters, with $0.05<z<0.30$ and $M_{500}>4\\times 10^{14}M_\\odot$, enabling subdivision into sizable morphological classes based on eROSITA data. The shape of the population-averaged profile, at our 250 kpc FWHM resolution, closely resembles the universal pressure profile, despite the flexibility of our model to accommodate alternative shapes, with a ~12% lower normalization, similar to what is needed to alleviate the tension between cosmological parameters derived from the CMB and Planck SZ cluster counts. Beyond $r_{500}$, our profile is steeper than previous determinations. The intrinsic scatter is consistent with or lower than previous estimates, despite the broader diversity expected from our SZ selection. Our flexible pressure modelization identifies a few clusters with non-standard concavity in their radial profiles but no outliers in amplitude. When dividing the sample by morphology, we find remarkably similar pressure profiles across classes.",

      "abstract": "Morphological characteristics of protohalos and their connection to halo formation histories Farnik Nikakhtar, Daisuke Nagai, Marcello Musso, Ravi K. Sheth Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Protohalos, primordial regions in the initial cosmic density field that evolve into dark matter halos, are crucial for understanding cosmic structure formation. Motivated by the potential to reconstruct protohalo positions and shapes from observed galaxies using a novel approach grounded in optimal transport theory, we revisit the relationship between the structural properties of protohalos and the formation histories, concentrations, and final morphologies of their associated dark matter halos. To better understand halo assembly, we introduce a new estimator defined by an integral over redshifts and compare its performance to $z_{50}$, the commonly used redshift at which half of the final halo mass is formed. We quantify protohalo structure using the three invariants of the inertia, deformation, and energy shear tensors. Although past research has correlated the first two invariants of the deformation and energy tensors with halo formation, our findings reveal that the third invariant also significantly correlates with the final halo shape. We discuss the prospect of using optimal transport to connect our protohalo results to observations of high-redshift protoclusters to better align theoretical models with observational data.",

Comments welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We compute the 3D cross-correlation between the absorption of the $z\\sim 2.3$ Lyman-alpha forest measured by the COSMOS Lyman-Alpha Mapping And Tomography Observations (CLAMATO) survey, and 1642 foreground galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from several different surveys, including 3D-HST, CLAMATO, zCOSMOS-Deep, MOSDEF, and VUDS. For each survey, we compare the measured cross-correlation with models incorporating the galaxy linear bias as well as observed redshift dispersion and systematic redshift offset. The derived redshift dispersion and offsets are generally consistent with those expected from, e.g., spectroscopic redshifts measured with UV absorption lines or NIR emission lines observed with specific instruments, but we find hints of `fingers-of-god' caused by overdensities in the field. We combine our foreground galaxy sample, and split them into 3 bins of robustly-estimated stellar mass in order to study the stellar mass-halo mass relationship. For sub-samples with median stellar masses of $\\log_{10}(M_* / M_\\odot) = [9.23,9.71,10.21]$, we find galaxy biases of $b_g\\approx [2.9, 3.3,4.7]$, respectively. A comparison with mock measurements from the Bolshoi-Planck $N$-body simulation yields corresponding halo masses of $\\log_{10}(M_* / M_\\odot) \\approx [10.3,11.6,12.1]$ for these stellar mass bins. At the low mass end, our results suggest enhanced star formation histories in mild tension with predictions from previous angular correlation and abundance matching-based observations, and the IllustrisTNG simulation.",

Hydrodynamical simulations are often used to constrain priors or calibrate models. Therefore, obtaining the maximum amount of information possible from these simulations is imperative. In this work, we have combined the information of shapes projected over two or three axes ($x,y,z$), for intrinsic alignment signals ($w_{g+},\\ \\tilde{\\xi}_{g+,2}$), showing a consistent gain in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for all cases studied using TNG300-1. The gain in SNR is found to be higher for the addition of the second projection than for the third, and higher for shapes calculated using the reduced inertia tensor rather than the simple one. The two shape samples studied, $n_\\star>300$ and $\\mathrm{log}(M_\\star \\ h/\\mathrm{M_\\odot})>10.5$, where the latter has a much higher signal amplitude, show similar gains in SNR when more projections are added. We also model the correlation functions with the non-linear alignment model. The SNR gains from the measurements are higher but consistent with the constraints on the non-linear alignment amplitude $A_{\\rm IA}$ and galaxy bias $b_{\\rm g}$. Using multiple projection axes increases SNR overall, enabling more efficient use of numerically expensive hydrodynamical simulations.",

Faisst Submitted to MNRAS, 24 pages in length with 14 figures and 4 tables Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) In the first paper of this series, we derived mass constraints on the total mass and the baryonic components of the galaxy cluster Abell S1063. The main focus was to recover stellar masses and kinematics for cluster members, the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the intra-cluster light (ICL). In this second paper, we introduce a multi-probe mass modelling approach that incorporates constraints on both the total mass and the individual baryonic components. We obtain comprehensive mass models of Abell S1063, in which the dark matter distribution is disentangled from the baryonic mass at both cluster and galaxy scales. The best-fitting mass model achieves an RMS of $0.50\"$ on the multiple image positions. The kinematic profiles of the BCG \\& ICL, as well as the X-ray surface brightness of the intra-cluster gas, are accurately reproduced within observational uncertainties. However, a $35~\\mathrm{km/s}$ scatter is required for the cluster member line-of-sight dispersions. This method yields the most complex parametric mass model with consistency among almost all available mass constraints. We find a $1\\sigma$ agreement between the inferred stellar-to-subhalo mass relation and that predicted by large-scale cosmological simulations. The ICL stellar mass derived from our model is consistent with estimates from stellar population modelling. We present the first multi-probe mass modelling method capable of disentangling the dark matter from the baryonic mass distributions in massive galaxy clusters. Its results, such as the stellar-to-subhalo mass relation or the distribution of each mass component, can be directly compared to hydrodynamical cosmological simulations such as illustrisTNG.",

For the angular diameter distance, we use data from transverse baryon acoustic oscillations and galaxy clusters. On the other hand, the luminosity distance is obtained from Type Ia supernovae in the Pantheon+ sample and from quasar catalogs. To reduce the large dispersion in quasar luminosity distances, we apply a selection criterion based on their deviation from the $\\Lambda$CDM model and implement a binning procedure to suppress statistical noise. We reconstruct the CDDR using Gaussian Processes, a non-parametric supervised machine learning method.

Defining the final survey footprint is critical, as it excludes regions affected by artefacts or suboptimal observing conditions. For galaxy clustering, spatially varying observational systematics, such as seeing, are a leading source of bias. Template maps of contaminants are used to derive spatially dependent corrections, but extreme values may fall outside the applicability range of mitigation methods, compromising correction reliability. The complexity and accuracy of systematics modelling depend on footprint conservativeness, with aggressive masking enabling simpler, robust mitigation. We present a unified approach to define the DES Year 6 joint footprint, integrating observational systematics templates and artefact indicators that degrade mitigation performance. This removes extreme values from an initial seed footprint, leading to the final joint footprint. By evaluating the DES Year 6 lens sample MagLim++ plus plus on this footprint, we enhance the Iterative Systematics Decontamination (ISD) method, detecting non-linear systematic contamination and improving correction accuracy. While the mask's impact on clustering is less significant than systematics decontamination, it remains non-negligible, comparable to statistical uncertainties in certain w(theta) scales and redshift bins. Supporting coherent analyses of galaxy clustering and cosmic shear, the final footprint spans 4031.04 deg2, setting the basis for DES Year 6 1x2pt, 2x2pt, and 3x2pt analyses. This work highlights how targeted masking strategies optimise the balance between statistical power and systematic control in Stage-III and -IV surveys.",

Yamamoto Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) In this work, we derive and calibrate the redshift distribution of the MagLim++ lens galaxy sample used in the Dark Energy Survey Year 6 (DES Y6) 3x2pt cosmology analysis. The 3x2pt analysis combines galaxy clustering from the lens galaxy sample and weak gravitational lensing. The redshift distributions are inferred using the SOMPZ method - a Self-Organizing Map framework that combines deep-field multi-band photometry, wide-field data, and a synthetic source injection (Balrog) catalog. Key improvements over the DES Year 3 (Y3) calibration include a noise-weighted SOM metric, an expanded Balrog catalogue, and an improved scheme for propagating systematic uncertainties, which allows us to generate O($10^8$) redshift realizations that collectively span the dominant sources of uncertainty. These realizations are then combined with independent clustering-redshift measurements via importance sampling. The resulting calibration achieves typical uncertainties on the mean redshift of 1-2%, corresponding to a 20-30% average reduction relative to DES Y3. We compress the $n(z)$ uncertainties into a small number of orthogonal modes for use in cosmological inference. Marginalizing over these modes leads to only a minor degradation in cosmological constraints. This analysis establishes the MagLim++ sample as a robust lens sample for precision cosmology with DES Y6 and provides a scalable framework for future surveys.",

We aim to provide the theoretical framework for studying shear four-point correlation functions (4PCF) using fourth-order aperture statistics and develop a numerical integration pipeline to compute them. Finally, we forecast the information content of fourth-order aperture statistics. We begin by giving the relation of the $n$-th order aperture statistics, $\\langle M_\\mathrm{ap}^n\\rangle$, to the shear $n$PCF and to the convergence polyspectra. We then focus on the fourth-order case, where we derive the functional form of their filters and test the behavior of these filters by numerically integrating over the 4PCF of a Gaussian random shear field (GRF). Finally, we perform a Fisher forecast on the constraining power of $\\langle M_\\mathrm{ap}^4\\rangle_\\rm{c}$, where we develop a novel method to estimate derivatives from a simulation suite with arbitrarily distributed cosmological sets. By analyzing and mitigating numerical effects within the integration pipeline, we achieve a two-percent-level precision on the fourth-order aperture statistics for a GRF, which remains well below the noise budget of Stage IV surveys. We report a minimal improvement in the constraining power of the aperture statistics when including fourth-order statistics to a $\\langle M_\\mathrm{ap}^2\\rangle + \\langle M_\\mathrm{ap}^3\\rangle$ joint analysis for a DES-Y3-like setup, using non-tomographic equal-scale aperture statistics.",

Stage-III lensing surveys have sufficient statistical power to significantly detect cumulant-based statistics up to fourth order. We derive and validate an efficient estimation procedure for the four-point correlation function (4PCF) of polar fields such as weak lensing shear. We then use our approach to measure the shear 4PCF and the fourth-order aperture mass statistics in the DES Y3 survey. We construct an efficient estimator for fourth-order shear statistics which builds on the multipole decomposition of the shear 4PCF. We then validate our estimator on mock ellipticity catalogues obtained from Gaussian random fields and on realistic $N$-body simulations. Finally, we apply our estimator to the DES Y3 data and present a measurement of the fourth-order aperture statistics in a non-tomographic setup. Due to its quadratic scaling, our estimator provides a significant speed-up over hypothetical brute force or tree-based estimation methods of the shear 4PCF. We report a significant detection of the connected part of the fourth-order aperture mass in the DES Y3 data. We find the sampling distribution of the fourth-order aperture mass to be significantly skewed. We make our estimator code available on GitHub as part of the orpheus package.",

Furlanetto 29 pages, 10 figures, submitted to JCAP; comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) By opening up new avenues to statistically constrain astrophysics and cosmology with large-scale structure observations, the line intensity mapping (LIM) technique calls for novel tools for efficient forward modeling and inference. Implicit likelihood inference (ILI) from semi-numerical simulations provides a powerful setup for investigating a large model parameter space in a data-driven manner, therefore gaining significant recent attention. Using simulations of high-redshift 158$\\mu$m [CII] and 88$\\mu$m [OIII] LIM signals created by the LIMFAST code, we develop an ILI framework in a case study of learning the physics of early galaxy formation from the auto-power spectra of these lines or their cross-correlation with galaxy surveys. We leverage neural density estimation with normalizing flows to learn the mapping between the simulated power spectra and parameters that characterize the physics governing the star formation efficiency and the $\\dot{\\Sigma}_{\\star}$-$\\Sigma_\\mathrm{g}$ relation of high-redshift galaxies. Our results show that their partially degenerate effects can be unambiguously constrained when combining [CII] with [OIII] measurements to be made by new-generation mm/sub-mm LIM experiments.",

Comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) Recent years have seen many arguments for cosmic rays (CRs) as an important influence on galactic and circumgalactic (CGM) physics, star and galaxy formation. We present a pedagogical overview of state-of-the-art modeling of CR-magnetohydrodynamics (CR-MHD) on macro scales (~kpc), highlighting their fundamental dependence on the micro (< au) scales of CR gyro orbits and meso (~pc) scales of CR mean-free-paths, intended to connect the extragalactic, Galactic, and plasma CR transport modeling communities. We note the pitfalls and systematic errors that arise from older assumptions in CR modeling, including: use of a simple Fokker-Planck equation or ad-hoc two-moment formalisms for transport; assumption of leaky boxes or plane-parallel or shear-periodic boundaries for comparison to local interstellar medium (LISM) observations; ignoring detailed LISM constraints on CR spectra (e.g. focusing only on extragalactic observables or spectrally integrated models); assuming CR transport is mediated by classical models of advection, streaming from self-confinement (super-Alfvenic or Alfvenic), or extrinsic turbulence. We emphasize recent progress addressing these: development of rigorously-derived CR-MHD equations; use of global, 3D galaxy+halo models for LISM comparisons; new methods for full-spectrum dynamics; novel models for intermittent scattering and/or new drivers. We compile extragalactic+LISM observations to show how ~GeV CR transport is being rapidly constrained in the CGM, and present phenomenological models which can be used in future simulations. We conclude by highlighting critical open questions for micro, meso, and macro-scale CR-MHD simulations.",

In this first paper, we focus on recovering the mass constraint datasets required for the modelling approach introduced in the second paper. Specifically, we measure the light distribution, stellar mass, and kinematics of the cluster members, the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and the intra-cluster light (ICL) in Abell S1063. To that end, we developed a new method to extract the light profiles of the cluster members, BCG, and ICL, while accounting for contamination from nearby foreground and background galaxies in \\textsc{Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) imaging. We obtained light profiles for $289$ cluster members using a dual Pseudo-Isothermal Elliptical (dPIE) model based on the HST F160W filter, while the BCG \\& ICL is modelled as a single component using a multi-Gaussian expansion. To estimate stellar masses and velocity dispersions, we rely on multi-band HST photometry and \\textsc{VLT/MUSE} integral field spectroscopy, respectively. Stellar masses are derived using three different spectral energy distribution (SED) models. We measure the line-of-sight velocity dispersions of the cluster members at their half-light radii, as determined from their light profiles, while for the BCG \\& ICL components, we use elliptical annular apertures. Thanks to these measurements, we will be able to constrain the cluster stellar mass content, which is detailed in the second paper of the series. We publicly release these measurements with intermediary data products.",

Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Methodology (stat.ME) We present exact non-Gaussian joint likelihoods for auto- and cross-correlation functions on arbitrarily masked spherical Gaussian random fields. Our considerations apply to spin-0 as well as spin-2 fields but are demonstrated here for the spin-2 weak-lensing correlation function. We motivate that this likelihood cannot be Gaussian and show how it can nevertheless be calculated exactly for any mask geometry and on a curved sky, as well as jointly for different angular-separation bins and redshift-bin combinations. Splitting our calculation into a large- and small-scale part, we apply a computationally efficient approximation for the small scales that does not alter the overall non-Gaussian likelihood shape. To compare our exact likelihoods to correlation-function sampling distributions, we simulated a large number of weak-lensing maps, including shape noise, and find excellent agreement for one-dimensional as well as two-dimensional distributions. Furthermore, we compare the exact likelihood to the widely employed Gaussian likelihood and find significant levels of skewness at angular separations $\\gtrsim 1^{\\circ}$, such that the mode of the exact distributions is shifted away from the mean towards lower values of the correlation function. We find that the assumption of a Gaussian random field for the weak-lensing field is well valid at these angular separations. Considering the skewness of the non-Gaussian likelihood, we evaluate its impact on the posterior constraints on $S_8$. On a simplified weak-lensing-survey setup with an area of $10 \\ 000 \\ \\mathrm{deg}^2$, we find that the posterior mean of $S_8$ is around $2.5\\%$ higher when using the non-Gaussian likelihood, a shift comparable to the precision of current stage-III surveys.",

More importantly, we have taken the PLP model as a case study to check the new slow-roll approximations method proposed in \\cite{Pozdeeva:2024ihc}. Then we take one step further to check the consequence of generalized reheating in this scenario. Thus opening a new promising window to study inflationary dynamics in EGB gravity.",

A key method for probing this distribution is via weak gravitational lensing mass-mapping - a challenging ill-posed inverse problem where one infers the convergence field from observed shear measurements. Upcoming stage IV surveys, such as those made by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Euclid satellite, will provide a greater quantity and precision of data for lensing analyses, necessitating high-fidelity mass-mapping methods that are computationally efficient and that also provide uncertainties for integration into downstream cosmological analyses. In this work we introduce MMGAN, a novel mass-mapping method based on a regularised conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, which generates approximate posterior samples of the convergence field given shear data. We adopt Wasserstein GANs to improve training stability and apply regularisation techniques to overcome mode collapse, issues that otherwise are particularly acute for conditional GANs. We train and validate our model on a mock COSMOS-style dataset before applying it to true COSMOS survey data. Our approach significantly outperforms the Kaiser-Squires technique and achieves similar reconstruction fidelity as alternative state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. Notably, while alternative approaches for generating samples from a learned posterior are slow (e.g. requiring $\\sim$10 GPU minutes per posterior sample), MMGAN can produce a high-quality convergence sample in less than a second.",

      "abstract": "Can dark energy explain a high growth index? Ícaro B. S. Cortês, Ronaldo C. Batista 13 pages, 10 figures, matches the PRD version Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) A promising way to test the physics of the accelerated expansion of the Universe is by studying the growth rate of matter fluctuations, which can be parametrized by the matter energy density parameter to the power $\\gamma$, the so-called growth index. It is well-known that the $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology predicts $\\gamma=0.55$. However, using observational data, Nguyen et al. (2023) measured a much higher $\\gamma=0.633^{+0.025}_{-0.024}$, excluding the $\\Lambda$CDM value within $3.7\\sigma$. In this work, we analyze whether Dark Energy (DE) with the Equation of State (EoS) parameter described by the CPL parametrization can significantly modify $\\gamma$ with respect to the predicted $\\Lambda$CDM one. Besides the usual Smooth DE (SDE) scenario, where DE perturbations are neglected on small scales, we also consider the case of Clustering Dark Energy (CDE), which has more potential to impact the growth of matter perturbations. In order to minimally constrain the background evolution and assess the largest meaningful $\\gamma$ distribution, we use data from $32$ Cosmic Chronometers, $H(z$), data points. In this context, we found that both SDE and CDE models described by the CPL parametrization have almost negligible probability of providing $\\gamma>0.6$. However, given that the measured $\\gamma$ value assumes the $\\Lambda$CDM background, a direct statistical measure of the incompatibility between theory and the measured value can not be done for other backgrounds. Thus, we devise a method in order to make a quick estimation of the $\\gamma$ constraints for CPL background. This method indicates that, when using DESI DR2 BAO data to constrain background parameters, no significant changes in the $\\gamma$ central value and uncertainty is observed. (Abridged)",

In this work, we discuss a model of quintessence interacting with dark matter and analyze the resulting phenomenology of the dark energy equation of state. We identify two regions where the equation of state behaves differently depending on the size of the dark matter-dark energy interaction strength. We show that the strong coupling region induces a transmutation of quintessence from thawing to freezing. Using the recent data release from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we rule out this possibility of transmutation and investigate the weak coupling region to derive upper limits on the interaction strength. Our analysis indicates that while $\\Lambda$CDM lies within the $1\\sigma$ contour in the $w_0$-$w_a$ plane, the best fit points lie in the fourth quadrant and show deviations from the $\\Lambda$CDM prediction.",

In this work, using simulated rotation curves, we train neural networks, which can then be fed observed rotation curves of dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies from the SPARC catalog, to infer parameter values and their uncertainties. Since observed rotation curves have errors, we also explore the very important effect of noise in the training data on the inference. We employ two different methods to quantify uncertainties in the estimated parameters, and compare the results with those obtained using Bayesian methods.

Accepted in Physical Review D Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The 21cm forest, narrow absorption features in the spectra of high redshift radio sources caused by intervening neutral hydrogen, offers a unique probe of the intergalactic medium and small-scale structures during reionization. While traditional power spectrum methods have been widely used for analyzing the 21cm forest, these techniques are limited in capturing the non-Gaussian nature of the signal. In this work, we introduce the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) as a novel diagnostic tool for the 21cm forest, which allows for the extraction of higher-order statistical features that power spectrum methods cannot easily capture. By decomposing simulated brightness temperature spectra into a hierarchy of scattering coefficients, the WST isolates both local intensity fluctuations (first-order coefficients) and scale-scale correlations (second-order coefficients), revealing the complex, multi-scale non-Gaussian interactions inherent in the 21cm forest. This approach enhances the power of 21cm forest in distinguishing between different cosmological models, such as Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Warm Dark Matter (WDM), as well as scenarios with enhanced X-ray heating. Unlike traditional methods, which focus primarily on Gaussian statistics, the WST captures richer astrophysical and cosmological information. Our analysis shows that WST can significantly improve constraints on key parameters, such as the X-ray heating efficiency and the WDM particle mass, providing deeper insights into the early stages of cosmic structure formation.",

Lett. 135, 081003 (2025) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) is a massively parallel spectroscopic survey on the Mayall telescope at Kitt Peak, which has released measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations determined from over 14 million extragalactic targets. We combine DESI Data Release 2 with CMB datasets to search for evidence of matter conversion to dark energy (DE), focusing on a scenario mediated by stellar collapse to cosmologically-coupled black holes (CCBH). In this physical model, which has the same number of free parameters as $\\Lambda$CDM, DE production is determined by the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD), allowing for distinct early- and late-time cosmologies. Using two SFRDs to bracket current observations, we find that the CCBH model: accurately recovers the cosmological expansion history, agrees with early-time baryon abundance measured by BBN, reduces tension with the local distance ladder, and relaxes constraints on the summed neutrino mass $\\sum m_\\nu$. For these SFRDs, we find a peaked positive $\\sum m_\\nu < 0.149\\,\\rm eV$ (95% confidence) and $\\sum m_\\nu = 0.106^{+0.050}_{-0.069}\\,\\rm eV$ respectively, in good agreement with lower limits from neutrino oscillation experiments.

Martinet Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Aims: The precision of cosmological constraints from imaging surveys hinges on accurately estimating the redshift distribution $ n(z) $ of tomographic bins, especially their mean redshifts. We assess the effectiveness of the clustering redshifts technique in constraining Euclid tomographic redshift bins to meet the target uncertainty of $ \\sigma ( \\langle z \\rangle ) < 0.002 (1 + z) $. In this work, these mean redshifts are inferred from the small-scale angular clustering of Euclid galaxies, which are distributed into bins with spectroscopic samples localised in narrow redshift slices. Methods: We generate spectroscopic mocks from the Flagship2 simulation for the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), and Euclid's Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) spectroscopic survey. We evaluate and optimise the clustering redshifts pipeline, introducing a new method for measuring photometric galaxy bias (clustering), which is the primary limitation of this technique. Results: We have successfully constrained the means and standard deviations of the redshift distributions for all of the tomographic bins (with a maximum photometric redshift of 1.6), achieving precision beyond the required thresholds. We have identified the main sources of bias, particularly the impact of the 1-halo galaxy distribution, which imposed a minimal separation scale of 1.5 Mpc for evaluating cross-correlations. These results demonstrate the potential of clustering redshifts to meet the precision requirements for Euclid, and we highlight several avenues for future improvements.",

Associated code at this https URL Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Simulations have established that each halo of collisionless dark matter is expected to contain a $\\rho = A r^{-1.5}$ density cusp at its center. This prompt cusp is a relic of the halo's earliest moments and has a mass comparable to the cutoff scale in the spectrum of initial density perturbations. In this work, we provide a framework to predict for each halo the coefficient $A$ of its central cusp. We also present a \"cusp-NFW\" functional form that accurately describes the density profile of a halo with a prompt cusp at its center. Accurate characterization of each halo's central cusp is of particular importance in the study of warm dark matter models, for which the spectral cutoff is on an astrophysically relevant mass scale. To facilitate easy incorporation of prompt cusps into any halo modeling approach, we provide a code package that implements the cusp-halo relation and the cusp-NFW density profile.",

This method is non-parametric, allowing us to infer mass profiles, or equivalently circular velocities, without having to assume a specific halo profile. While this method assumes spherical symmetry, we show that, on average, triaxiality is unlikely to significantly affect our results. We use this method to study the total mass profiles of the CLASH clusters, as well as the relation between their total and baryonic components: (1) We find that the implied circular velocities are consistent with being approximately flat at large radii, akin to the rotation curves of galaxies. (2) We infer radially resolved baryonic mass fractions, finding that these vary significantly from cluster to cluster and depend strongly on the details of the X-ray gas mass profiles. Since the gas mass profiles are poorly constrained at large radii, it is unclear whether the CLASH clusters reach the cosmic baryon fraction expected in $\\Lambda$CDM. (3) The non-parametric masses are consistent with the stellar mass--halo mass relation expected in $\\Lambda$CDM. (4) Galaxy clusters systematically deviate from the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR) and the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) defined by galaxies, but the magnitude of the offset depends strongly on the gas mass extrapolation at large radii. Contrary to some previous results based on hydrostatic equilibrium, we find that galaxy clusters may fall on the same BTFR and RAR as galaxies if one adds a suitable positive baryonic mass component.",

Ligori 19 pages, submitted to A&A, revised after referee report Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present two extensive sets of 3500+1000 simulations of dark matter haloes on the past light cone, and two corresponding sets of simulated (`mock') galaxy catalogues that represent the Euclid spectroscopic sample. The simulations were produced with the latest version of the PINOCCHIO code, and provide the largest, public set of simulated skies. Mock galaxy catalogues were obtained by populating haloes with galaxies using an halo occupation distribution (HOD) model extracted from the Flagship galaxy catalogue provided by Euclid Collaboration. The Geppetto set of 3500 simulated skies was obtained by tiling a 1.2 Gpc/h box to cover a light-cone whose sky footprint is a circle of 30 deg radius, for an area of 2763 deg$^2$ and a minimum halo mass of $1.5\\times10^{11}$ Msun/h. The relatively small box size makes this set unfit for measuring very large scales. The EuclidLargeBox set consists of 1000 simulations of 3.38 Gpc/h, with the same mass resolution and a footprint that covers half of the sky, excluding the Milky Way zone of avoidance. From this we produced a set of 1000 EuclidLargeMocks on the 30 deg radius footprint, whose comoving volume is fully contained in the simulation box. We validated the two sets of catalogues by analysing number densities, power spectra, and 2-point correlation functions, showing that the Flagship spectroscopic catalogue is consistent with being one of the realisations of the simulated sets, although we noticed small deviations limited to the quadrupole at k>0.2 h/Mpc. We show cosmological parameter inference from these catalogues and demonstrate that using one realisation of EuclidLargeMocks in place of the Flagship mock produces the same posteriors, to within the expected shift given by sample variance. These simulated skies will be used for the galaxy clustering analysis of Euclid's Data Release 1 (DR1).",

Rubin Observatory, approximately two-thirds of the galaxies are likely to be affected by blending - the overlap of physically separated galaxies in images. Thus, extracting reliable shapes and photometry from individual objects will be limited by our ability to correct blending and control any residual systematic effect. Deblending algorithms tackle this issue by reconstructing the isolated components from a blended scene, but the most commonly used algorithms often fail to model complex realistic galaxy morphologies. As part of an effort to address this major challenge, we present MADNESS, which takes a data-driven approach and combines pixel-level multi-band information to learn complex priors for obtaining the maximum a posteriori solution of deblending. MADNESS is based on deep neural network architectures such as variational auto-encoders and normalizing flows. The variational auto-encoder reduces the high-dimensional pixel space into a lower-dimensional space, while the normalizing flow models a data-driven prior in this latent space. Using a simulated test dataset with galaxy models for a 10-year LSST survey and a galaxy density ranging from 48 to 80 galaxies per arcmin2 we characterize the aperture-photometry g-r color, structural similarity index, and pixel cosine similarity of the galaxies reconstructed by MADNESS. We compare our results against state-of-the-art deblenders including scarlet. With the r-band of LSST as an example, we show that MADNESS performs better than in all the metrics. For instance, the average absolute value of relative flux residual in the r-band for MADNESS is approximately 29% lower than that of scarlet. The code is publicly available on GitHub.",

In a (25 $h^{-1}$ Mpc)$^3$ box we perform a set of numerical experiments that systematically vary the mass and energy loadings of such winds, finding that their energy content is the key parameter controlling the stellar to dark matter mass ratio. Increasing the mass loading, at fixed energy, actually results in mildly enhanced star formation, counter to prevailing wisdom, due to the wind becoming cooler. Of the simple parametrisations that we test, we find that an energy loading that scales inversely with halo mass best matches a wide range of observations and can do so with mass loadings drastically lower than those in most previous cosmological simulations. In this scenario, much less material is ejected from the interstellar medium. Instead, winds both heat gas in the circumgalactic medium, slowing infall onto the galaxy, and also drive shocks beyond the virial radius, decreasing the halo-scale accretion rate. We can also report that a much lower fraction of the available supernova energy is needed in preventative galaxy regulation than required by ejective wind feedback models such as IllustrisTNG.

Resonances in the self-interaction cross section, features of hidden-sector models with light mediators and attractive potentials, can boost the strength of self-interactions near specific relative velocities, accelerating collapse in halos with central velocity dispersions near the resonance. To explore this phenomenon, we present a suite of idealized N-body simulations of isolated halos with masses $10^7$-$10^9 \\ \\rm{M_\\odot}$ evolved under two resonant cross section (RCS) models with localized enhancement to the cross section on scales $v \\sim 5$-$50 \\ \\rm{km} \\ \\rm{s^{-1}}$. We show that the change in halo internal structure depends on how the velocity distribution of bound particles moves across resonances in the cross section during core formation and collapse. The interplay between the velocity distribution of bound particles and localized features of the cross section causes deviations from self-similar evolution, a characteristic of velocity-independent cross sections, at the level of up to $20\\%$. Depending on the alignment with resonant features, halos of different masses reach different evolutionary stages after a fixed physical time and develop diverse density profiles and rotation curves.",

Siebert, Sune Toft, Thomas Wevers, Yossef Zenati Accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The rates and properties of tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide valuable insights into their host galaxy central stellar densities and the demographics of their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). TDEs have been observed only at low redshifts ($z \\lesssim 1$), due to the difficulty in conducting deep time-domain surveys. In this work, we present the discovery of a high-redshift TDE candidate, HZTDE-1, in the COSMOS-Web survey with JWST's NIRCam, using a novel selection technique based on color and morphology. We first outline a methodology for identifying high-z TDEs in deep infrared imaging surveys, leveraging their unique spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and morphologies of these transients. We apply this technique to COSMOS-Web in filters F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W, and identify HZTDE-1, a transient point source relative to archival UltraVISTA infrared observations. If we assume it is a TDE, we estimate its photometric redshift to be $z=5.02^{+1.32}_{-1.11}$. HZTDE-1 cannot be explained by reasonable supernova or AGN models. However, we cannot rule out a superluminous supernova at $z\\gtrsim3$. If confirmed with follow-up observations, HZTDE-1 would represent the highest-redshift TDE discovery to date, and would suggest an enhancement of the TDE rate in the high-redshift universe. Our method, which can be applied to future deep surveys with JWST and Roman, offers a pathway to identify TDEs at $z>4$ and probe black hole demographics at early cosmic times.",

However, the thousands of strong-lens candidates now routinely discovered in wide-field imaging surveys make one-by-one follow-up observations impractical. In this work, we investigate the capability and efficiency of large-scale spectroscopic surveys in confirming strong-lens systems. As a case study, we cross-match strong lens candidates identified from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program with Data Release 1 (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We find that DESI DR1 serendipitously observed putative lenses and/or lensed images in approximately 50\\% of these candidates. Analyzing the DESI spectra for $\\approx 500$ matched candidates that meet our selection criteria, we determine both lens and source redshifts for 27 systems. Additionally, 76 candidate systems feature lensing galaxies at $z > 0.8$, and one candidate system contains a quasar within its lensing galaxy. Applying this approach to other strong-lens candidates will yield many more confirmations, with a further several-fold increase anticipated from the final DESI data release. Our results highlight the growing importance of large-scale spectroscopic surveys in advancing strong lensing discoveries and science.",

Marshall, Andrea Gnarini 16 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables, submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Observations from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) have revealed electric vector position angle (EVPA) rotation in several neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries, including the galactic X-ray burster GX 13+1. We developed a novel Bayesian nested sampling framework-\"Q-U Event-by-Event Nested sampling for Bayesian EVPA Evolution\" (QUEEN-BEE)-to model unbinned Stokes parameters and infer optimal EVPA rotation rates in IXPE data. We then applied this framework to three previous IXPE observations of GX 13+1. In the first observation, QUEEN-BEE recovers a rotation rate of 42+/-4 degrees/day, consistent with prior binned analysis. Energy-binned QUEEN-BEE analysis of this first observation suggests a slab-like coronal geometry, providing the first constraints between slab and shell coronae for this source. We also explore alternative EVPA rotation scenarios in GX 13+1 including variable disk wind behavior. The second observation of this source shows no evidence of rotation, and the third observation shows transient rotating behavior with an EVPA rotation rate when exiting a light curve dip of 170 +20/-40 degrees/day. The results show marginal but consistent increases in the overall measured polarization degree (PD) for epochs where the EVPA rotation is identified. These results demonstrate that QUEEN-BEE can identify evolving polarization signatures in both time- and energy-resolved regimes, even where binned methods fall below detection thresholds. Our findings highlight the diagnostic potential of QUEEN-BEE as a tool for discriminating between competing physical models of coronal geometry and probing disk-wind-related polarization behavior, highlighting the promising potential for application of this framework in a variety of other IXPE observations.",

In such dense environments, stars can undergo close encounters with BHs and fall within their tidal radius, resulting in micro-tidal disruption events (micro-TDEs), transient phenomena with potential multi-messenger signatures. We performed a suite of direct N-body simulations using the PETAR code, to which we implemented new prescriptions for modeling micro-TDEs. We constructed a set of realistic YSC models including primordial binaries, based on the observed Milky Way population. Our simulations incorporate stellar and binary evolution, supernova kicks, and stellar winds using the BSE code, and account for the Galactic tidal field via the GALPY library. We identify three dynamical channels for micro-TDE production: single star-single BH encounters, binary-mediated interactions (including supernova-kick triggers), and interactions involving higher-order multiple systems such as hierarchical triples and quadruples, as well as chaotic few-body interactions. Multiple encounters are the most efficient production channel, which dominates the total rate: 350-450 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. Micro-TDEs from YSCs are expected to be detectable by upcoming surveys, particularly the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, with detection rates potentially up to hundreds per year. The gravitational wave (GW) signals expected from micro-TDEs peak in the deci-Hertz band, making them accessible to future instruments such as the Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna and the Deci-Hertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. Micro-TDEs emerge as promising multi-messenger sources, potentially offering unique insights into star cluster dynamics, stellar collisions, and the population of dormant stellar-mass BHs, through both electromagnetic and GW observations.",

In this work, we report the first radio detection of a SN Ibn, SN 2023fyq, and characterize the mass-loss history of its stellar progenitor using the radio and X-ray observations obtained over 18 months post-explosion. We find that the radio emission from 58--185 days is best modeled by synchrotron radiation attenuated by free-free absorption from a CSM of density $\\sim$ $10^{-18}$ g/$\\rm{cm^{3}}$ ($\\sim 10^{6} \\mathrm{\\rho_{ISM}}$) at a radius of $10^{16}$ cm, corresponding to a mass-loss rate of $\\sim$ $4 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{M_{\\odot} \\ yr^{-1}}$ (for a wind velocity of 1700 km/s from optical spectroscopy) from 0.7 to 3 years before the explosion. This timescale is consistent with the time frame over which pre-explosion optical outbursts were observed. However, our late-time observations at 525 days post-explosion yield non-detections, and the 3$\\sigma$ upper limits (along with an X-ray non-detection) allow us to infer lower-density CSM at $2\\times 10^{16}$ cm with $\\rm{\\dot{M}}$ $< 2.5\\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{M_{\\odot} \\ yr^{-1}}$. These results suggest a shell-like CSM from at most $4 \\times 10^{15}$ to $2 \\times 10^{16}$ cm ($\\sim 10^{5} R_{\\rm{\\odot}}$) with an elevated CSM density (0.004 $\\mathrm{M_{\\odot} \\ yr^{-1}}$) that is roughly consistent with predictions from a merger model for this object.

The \\textit{Einstein Probe} has detected a significant number of fast X-ray transients that display no gamma-ray emission, complicating their robust association to more common gamma-ray bursts. To explore their possible connection, we analyzed the redshift distribution of both \\textit{Einstein Probe} fast X-ray transients and long duration gamma-ray bursts. A comparative analysis of their cumulative redshift distributions using non-parametric two-sample tests, namely the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Anderson-Darling tests, finds no statistically significant difference. These tests favor that their redshifts are drawn from the same underlying distribution. This empirical connection between \\textit{Einstein Probe} transients and long gamma-ray bursts is further supported by their agreement with the so-called ``Amati relation'' between the spectral peak energy and the isotropic-equivalent energy. Together, these results indicate that most extragalactic \\textit{Einstein Probe} fast X-ray transients are closely related to long gamma-ray bursts and originate from a massive star (collapsar) progenitor channel. Our findings highlight the role of the \\textit{Einstein Probe} in uncovering the missing population of failed jets and dirty fireballs that emit primarily at soft X-ray wavelengths.",

State-of-the-art approaches often accomplish this with hierarchical Bayesian inference. However, this typically relies on Monte Carlo approximations that are already very expensive in current data, and may become prohibitively so in the future. In this paper we show how this process can be understood from a first-principles statistical approach. We derive an error estimator $\\hat{E}$ for quantifying the amount of information that is lost due to the Monte Carlo approximation and recommend that this error is limited to no more than $\\hat{E} \\lesssim 0.2$ bits for reliable inference. We also show that the hierarchical likelihood estimator is biased but may be corrected. Finally, we show some practical examples for inference on synthetic gravitational-wave population inference, demonstrating that simple models with strong assumptions can be much more stable to Monte Carlo uncertainty than those with weaker assumptions. We also provide a \\texttt{pip}-installable package \\texttt{population-error} with which analysts can calculate the error statistics $\\hat{E}$.",

Amato, C. Malacaria 8 pages, 6 figures, A&A accepted on 3 Sept. 2025 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) High-Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs) serve as useful laboratories for exploring the behaviour of accreted matter onto compact objects and for probing the complex wind environments of massive stars. These investigations are essential for understanding stellar life cycles and the dynamics of the Milky Way, and they are prominent topics in the science cases for XRISM and NewAthena. We report, for the first time, a XRISM observation of the HMXB Vela X-1, conducted during the first cycle of the XRISM general observer programme and complemented by simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR coverage. This campaign targeted a critical orbital phase -- when the neutron star is in inferior conjunction -- during which significant changes in absorption are expected. We performed absorption-resolved spectral analyses during two time intervals of interest: the soft and hard hardness ratio (HR) intervals, as it is strongly correlated with absorption variability. We observed a sudden transition in the HR from a soft to a hard state, coinciding with an increase in the absorption column density. This is likely attributed to the onset of the accretion structure crossing our line of sight. With XRISM/Resolve, we also investigated the Fe K region, and we report for the first time the presence of a Fe K$\\alpha$ doublet in the spectrum of Vela X-1, together with the presence of already known Fe K$\\beta$ and Ni K$\\alpha$ lines that are produced in cold clumps embedded in the hot ionised wind. The measured line velocities of the order of $10^2 \\ \\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$ are consistent with production sites in the vicinity of the neutron star. This precursor study with Vela X-1 shows the potential of XRISM in studying in unprecedented details the spectral evolution of wind-accreting X-ray binaries.",

Blazar-boosted dark matter offers a way to overcome this limitation: relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei can accelerate light dark matter in their host-galaxy halos to energies capable of producing detectable nuclear recoil signals in xenon-based detectors on Earth. We present the first blazar-boosted dark matter search incorporating detector response modeling, using public data from XENON1T and LZ for the blazar TXS~0506+056. We model dark matter--proton scattering in the jet environment, covering the full process from jet acceleration to detector response.

However, the discrepancies between observations and theoretical model expectations highlight the need for refined uncertainty estimates. In the literature, spatial and temporal variability of lepton flux has been discussed as an uncertainty in diffuse $\\gamma$-ray estimation. In the present work, we demonstrate that variability in the high energy CR hadron flux is an important, yet previously underappreciated, source of uncertainty in diffuse $\\gamma$-ray estimates. To assess this effect, we perform fully three-dimensional, time-dependent GALPROP simulations of CR protons injected from discrete Galactic sources. Our results reveal that the uncertainty in the hadronic component of diffuse $\\gamma$ rays is non-negligible and can be comparable to, or even exceed, current experimental uncertainties at very high energies. This finding challenges the conventional assumption that only leptonic fluctuations are relevant to diffuse $\\gamma$-ray modeling.",

We perform meshless hydrodynamic simulations incorporating both general relativistic (GR) effects and radiative cooling to study TDEs in AGNs with different orbital inclinations ($\\theta_{\\rm inc}$) of the disrupted star, ranging from projected prograde to retrograde orbits. We post-process the simulations to derive multi-wavelength light curves and identify several distinct features in the light curves, including a precursor flare from early debris-disk collision and a major flare driven by fallback. The dynamics of the stellar debris and accretion disk, and subsequently the light curve features, are strongly affected by $\\theta_{\\rm inc}$ and GR effects. Retrograde orbits ($\\theta_{\\rm inc}=135^\\circ$) yield a more luminous, shorter major flare and a more prominent precursor than prograde ones ($\\theta_{\\rm inc}=22.5^\\circ$). During fallback, prograde cases ($\\theta_{\\rm inc} = 22.5^\\circ$, $45^\\circ$) develop a central cavity with spirals in the inner region of the AGN disk, leading to transient UV/X-ray suppression accompanied by oscillations, while higher inclinations ($\\theta_{\\rm inc}=90^\\circ$, $135^\\circ$) form a gradually tilting inner disk, potentially causing UV/X-ray dips via geometric effects at certain viewing angles. Relativistic apsidal precession alters stream collisions, producing structural differences in the inner disk, outer disk, and debris compared to Newtonian cases, and drives quasi-periodic signals in prograde configurations. These results provide predictive diagnostics for identifying AGN TDEs and interpreting observed light-curve diversity.",

Accepted for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) This study presents a statistical analysis of optical light curves (LCs) of 200 UVOT-detected GRBs from 2005 to 2018. We have categorised these LCs based on their distinct morphological features, including early flares, bumps, breaks, plateaus, etc. Additionally, to compare features across different wavelengths, we have also included XRT LCs in our sample. The early observation capability of UVOT has allowed us to identify very early flares in 21 GRBs preceding the normal decay or bump, consistent with predictions of external reverse or internal shock. The decay indices of optical LCs following a simple power-law (PL) are shallower than corresponding X-ray LCs, indicative of a spectral break between two wavelengths. Not all LCs with PL decay align with the forward shock model and require additional components such as energy injection or a structured jet. Further, plateaus in the optical LCs are primarily consistent with energy injection from the central engine to the external medium. However, in four cases, plateaus followed by steep decay may have an internal origin. The optical luminosity observed during the plateau is tightly correlated with the break time, indicative of a magnetar as their possible central engine. For LCs with early bumps, the peak position, correlations between the parameters, and observed achromaticity allowed us to constrain their origin as the onset of afterglow, off-axis jet, late re-brightening, etc. In conclusion, the ensemble of observed features is explained through diverse physical mechanisms or emissions observed from different outflow locations and, in turn, diversity among possible progenitors.",

Kapadia High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) can be leveraged to provide early-warning times of $\\mathcal{O}({\\rm hours})$ to $\\mathcal{O}({\\rm days})$ before the merger of Binary Neutron Stars (BNSs) and Neutron Star Black Holes (NSBHs). This in turn could enable electromagnetic (EM) telescopes to capture emissions surrounding the time of the merger. In this work, we assess the practicability of lensing-driven early-warning by analysing optical images of the lensed host galaxy to predict the arrival time of subsequent BNS/NSBH signals following the observation of the first signal. We produce mock lenses with image quality and resolution similar to images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the ground-based Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) on the Subaru telescope. We compare the time delay uncertainties between these two cases for typical lensed image configurations and multiplicity. These include doubles and quads, and among quads: the fold, cusp, cross image configurations. We find that time delay uncertainties for doubles are comparable for both HST and HSC mocks. On the other hand, quads tend to provide accurate time-delay predictions (typical relative error $\\sim0.1$) with HST. Analysis of a real lens led to a difference in time-delay estimates of $\\mathcal{O}(\\rm days)$ between the predictions derived from HST and HSC data. Our work therefore strongly advocates the need for high-resolution EM observations of lensed host galaxies to feasibly enable lensing-driven early-warning.",

In some cases these can be augmented by time/phase and energy weights. We provide a publicly available analysis tool to incorporate these new weights, validate our method on simulated data, and test it on archival IXPE observations.

IMPISH will take measurements of collimated, full-Sun X-ray spectra with the goal of detecting sub-second variations (order of tens of milliseconds) of nonthermal X-ray emission during the impulsive phase of large solar flares to probe particle acceleration mechanisms driven by magnetic reconnection. The IMPISH detector system, made up of four identical detectors totaling 64 cm$^2$ effective area, is capable of measuring from ~10 keV to over 200 keV through the use of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) and LYSO scintillators. At the stratospheric altitude of GRIPS-2, the effective lower energy limit is ~20-30 keV. The geometry of the LYSO crystal has been optimized to balance the light collection efficiency with the effective area required for stratospheric X-ray measurements. Development of the IMPISH detectors has introduced a path for a low-cost solution to fast solar X-ray measurements across a large energy range utilizing commercially available components. The payload has a 3U form factor and has been designed so that both the electronics and detectors may be easily adaptable for space-based missions.",

Comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn) The sources of turbulence in our Galaxy may be diverse, but core-collapse supernovae (SNe) alone provide enough energy to sustain a steady-state galactic turbulence cascade. By localizing and analyzing supernova remnants (SNRs) in high-resolution SNe-driven galactic disk cut-out simulations from Beattie et al. (2025), I show that SNRs radiate incompressible turbulence through baroclinic vorticity generation, localized at the interface where the hot and warm plasma phases mix near the cooling radius. I provide evidence that this process is seeded by a Vishniac (1994)-type instability, which corrugates and folds the interface. I present an analytical relation for a baroclinicity-fed incompressible mode spectrum, which matches that observed in the simulated SNRs. The unstable layer produces a spectrum of incompressible modes $\\propto k^{-3/2}$ locally within the SNRs. Through the inverse cascade mechanism described and measured in Beattie et al. (2025), this opens the possibility that the $\\propto k^{-3/2}$ spectrum, arising from corrugated folds in the unstable SNR layer, can imprint itself on kiloparsec scales, thereby connecting small-scale instabilities in the layer to the large-scale incompressible turbulence cascade.",

Existing machine-learning infrastructure can be leveraged in novel ways to search these datasets for new classes of transients. We present a machine-learning accelerated search pipeline for the Deeper, Wider, Faster (DWF) programme designed to identify high-quality astrophysical transient candidates that contain a single detection. Given the rapid observing cadence of the DWF programme, these single-detection transient candidates have durations on sub-minute timescales. This work marks the first time optical transients have been systematically explored on these timescales, to a depth of m$\\sim$23. We report the discovery of two high-quality sub-minute transient candidates from a pilot study of 671,761 light curves and investigate their potential origins with multiwavelength data. We discuss, in detail, possible non-astrophysical false positives, confidently reject electronic artefacts and asteroids, ruling out glints from satellites below 800 km and strongly disfavouring those at higher altitudes. We calculate a rate on the sky of $4.72^{+6.39}_{-3.28}\\times10^5$ per day for these sub-minute transient candidates.",

Subsequent observations, including late-time spectra with \\textit{JWST}, have highlighted the need for accurate modeling of kilonova ejecta. In the photospheric phase, atomic level populations can be estimated under LTE using Boltzmann and Saha relations, but about a week after the merger the ejecta enters the nebular phase where non-LTE effects dominate. Modeling nebular spectra therefore requires a detailed treatment of radiative and collisional processes that affect the population of atomic levels. This work focuses on electron-impact excitation in Sr II, a heavy ion relevant for kilonova spectra. Two computational approaches are employed: the Plane Wave Born approximation within the pseudo-relativistic Hartree-Fock method, and a Distorted Waves method using AUTOSTRUCTURE. The resulting collision strengths are compared against reference R-matrix data to evaluate the accuracy of these approximations and their suitability for large-scale applications to all heavy elements. In addition, radiative parameters for forbidden transitions are computed. These results provide an essential benchmark of approximations that could be used to compute atomic data for nebular-phase kilonova modeling.",

We find an averaged 2$-$8 keV polarisation degree of (3.3 ${\\pm}$ 0.4) % and a corresponding polarisation angle of 3° ${\\pm}$ 4°, which matches the polarisation detected during the rising stage of the outburst, in September$-$October 2023, within 1${\\sigma}$ uncertainty. The observational campaign complements previous studies of this source and enables comparison of the X-ray polarisation properties of a single transient across the X-ray hardness-intensity diagram. The complete recovery of the X-ray polarisation properties, including the energy dependence, came after a dramatic drop in the X-ray polarisation during the soft state. The new IXPE observations in the dim hard state at the reverse transition indicate that the accretion properties, including the geometry of the corona, appear to be strikingly similar to the bright hard state during the outburst rise despite the X-ray luminosities differing by two orders of magnitude.",

Comments welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present and analyze the extensive optical broadband photometry of the Type II SN 2023ixf up to one year after explosion. We find that, when compared to two pre-existing model grids, the bolometric light curve is consistent with drastically different combinations of progenitor and explosion properties. This may be an effect of known degeneracies in Type IIP light-curve models. We independently compute a large grid of $\\texttt{MESA+STELLA}$ single-star progenitor and light-curve models with various zero-age main-sequence masses, mass-loss efficiencies, and convective efficiencies. Using the observed progenitor variability as an additional constraint, we select stellar models consistent with the pulsation period and explode them according to previously established scaling laws to match plateau properties. Our hydrodynamic modeling indicates that SN 2023ixf is most consistent with a moderate-energy ($E_{\\rm exp}\\approx7\\times10^{50}$ erg) explosion of an initially high-mass red supergiant progenitor ($\\gtrsim 16.5\\ M_{\\odot}$) that lost a significant amount of mass in its prior evolution, leaving a low-mass hydrogen envelope ($\\lesssim 3\\ M_{\\odot}$) at the time of explosion, with a radius $\\gtrsim 950\\ R_{\\odot}$ and a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $\\approx0.068\\ M_{\\odot}$. We posit that previous mass transfer in a binary system may have stripped the envelope of SN 2023ixf's progenitor. The analysis method with pulsation period presented in this work offers a way to break degeneracies in light-curve modeling in the future, particularly with the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, when a record of progenitor variability will be more common.",

Here, we present deep radio observations of the fields surrounding three highly active repeating FRBs namely, FRB 20220912A, FRB 20240114A, and FRB 20240619D using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at low radio frequencies. Towards FRB~20240114A, we report the detection of compact source at 650\\,MHz with a flux density of 65.6$\\pm$8.1\\,$\\mu$Jy/beam. Our measurements of the spectral index, star formation rate of the host galaxy and recently reported constraints on the physical size strongly argue for our detected source to be a persistent radio source (PRS) associated with the FRB 20240114A. For FRB~20220912A, we detect radio emission that is most likely due to star formation in the host galaxy. For FRB 20240619D, we provide upper limits on the radio emission from an associated PRS or the host galaxy. The detection of the PRS associated with FRB~20240114A is a useful addition to the PRSs known to be associated with only three other FRBs so far, and further supports the origin of the PRS in the form of magnetoionic medium surrounding the FRB sources.",

Submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies occasionally disrupt stars or consume stellar-mass black holes (BHs) that wander too close, producing observable electromagnetic or gravitational wave signals. We examine how mass segregation impacts the rates and distributions of such events. Assuming a relaxed stellar cluster, composed of stars and stellar-mass BHs, we show that the tidal disruption rate of massive stars ($m\\gtrsim M_\\odot$) is enhanced relative to their abundance in the stellar population. For stars up to $m\\approx3M_\\odot$, this enhancement is roughly $m/M_\\odot$ and it is driven by segregation within the sphere of influence. Stars with masses $m\\gtrsim3M_\\odot$, if relaxed, are predominantly scattered by more massive stellar-mass BHs, leading to a constant enhancement factor of $\\approx 9$, independent of mass. This aligns with observational evidence suggesting an over-representation of massive stars in tidal disruption events. For stellar-mass BHs, we predict an enhancement factor scaling as $m_\\bullet^{1/2}$ for plunges and $m_\\bullet^{3/2}$ for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). The power of one-half in both cases reflects the shorter relaxation times of heavier BHs, allowing them to segregate into the sphere of influence from greater distances, thereby increasing their abundance. The additional power in the EMRIs' rate arises from the tendency of heavier BHs to circularize and sink inward more efficiently. Finally, we estimate the rate of main-sequence star inspirals and find that it favors low-mass stars ($m\\lesssim M_\\odot$). This seems compatible with the observationally estimated rate of quasiperiodic eruptions.",

Early spectra show C~III $\\lambda 5696$ emission reminiscent of Type~Icn SNe, which later gives way to Type~Ibn features. The He~I velocities ($1800$--$10{,}000$~km~s$^{-1}$) and pseudo-equivalent widths are among the highest in the Ibn/Icn class. The light curve declines at $0.14$~mag~d$^{-1}$ until $+30$~days, consistent with SNe~Ibn/Icn and slower than fast transients. SN~2023xgo is the faintest in our SN~Ibn sample ($M_r=-17.65\\pm0.04$) but shows typical color and host properties. Semi-analytical modeling of the light curve suggests a compact CSM shell ($\\sim 10^{12}$--$10^{13}$~cm) and a mass-loss rate of $10^{-4}$--$10^{-3}$~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$, with CSM and ejecta masses of $\\sim 0.22$ and $0.12$~$M_{\\odot}$, respectively. Post-maximum light-curve and spectral modeling favor a $\\sim 3$~$M_{\\odot}$ helium-star progenitor with extended ($\\sim 10^{15}$~cm), stratified CSM (density exponent $n=2.9$) and a mass-loss rate of $0.1$--$2.7$~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$. These two mass-loss regimes imply a radially varying CSM, shaped by asymmetry or temporal changes in the progenitor's mass loss. This behavior is compatible with both binary and single-star evolution. We argue that the early Icn-like features arise from hot carbon ionization and fade to Ibn-like signatures as the ejecta and CSM cool, making SN~2023xgo a rare probe of the connection between SNe~Icn, SNe~Ibn, and Ibn events with ejecta signatures.",

We use the flexible, energy-conserving SSsed model to model both the outer disc and inner, complex Comptonisation, using the expected disc emissivity to constrain the corona radius, $r_{cor}$. This decreases from 45 $R_{\\rm g}$ to 9 $R_{\\rm g}$ during the transition from the hard to hard intermediate and then soft intermediate state. We plot $r_{cor}$ versus the centroid frequency of the strong quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs; $\\nu_{\\rm c}$) seen in these data to test the inner hot flow Lense-Thirring (LT) precession model. The overall slope of the observed trend is in strong agreement with the predictions of LT precession, despite the complexities of accretion behavior, though there is an offset in absolute value which may indicate that the system parameters are still not well determined. The inner radius of the hot flow is consistent with a constant value throughout most of the outburst, indicating that changes in the jet (e.g. the discrete ejections) do not strongly affect the radiated power. Either the jet kinetic power is not a large fraction of the accretion power or the jet is instead mostly powered by the spin energy of the black hole.",

Here we present new JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy (IFS) observations of the $z=7.54$ quasar ULAS J1342+0928 obtained as part of the Galaxy Assembly with NIRSpec IFS (GA-NIFS) GTO programme. The new data-set obtained with both the prism ($R\\sim100$) and the high-resolution grating ($R\\sim2700$) allow for a complete description of the quasar emission from the rest-frame UV to optical bands. The low-resolution data reveal the presence of [\\ion{O}{iii}] emission on $\\sim$7 kpc scales, well above the typical galaxy size at this redshift, likely associated with a past outflow event. Additionally, the high-resolution observations show a more energetic ionised outflow on nuclear scales ($\\lesssim 0.6$ kpc). The total ionised mass outflow rate ranges between 50 and 300 $\\rm M_{\\odot} \\, yr^{-1}$ where the significant spread is mostly due to the lack of tight constraints on the electron density. This range overlaps in part with the star formation rate range (85--545 $\\rm M_{\\odot} \\, yr^{-1}$), implying that the nuclear outflow could ultimately lead to an early star formation quenching. By employing an accretion disc modelling, for the first time on \\textit{JWST} data, we manage to robustly estimate the black hole mass and the bolometric luminosity, $\\rm \\log(M_{BH}/(M_{\\odot}))=9.2\\pm 0.2$ and $\\rm \\log(L_{bol}/(erg \\, s^{-1}))=46.8\\pm 0.1$, respectively.

Deason 18 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables, 2 appendices Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The satellite population of the Milky Way is shaped by a range of astrophysical processes including mergers, star formation, feedback, and cosmic reionisation. Determining which processes most strongly influence its properties is challenging and a key test of galaxy formation models. We train a neural network on the GALFORM semi-analytic model and apply a variance-based sensitivity analysis to characterise the influence of 11 astrophysical parameters on two key observables: the satellite luminosity function, and the mass-metallicity relation. We find that: (1) the abundance of bright satellites ($\\mathrm{M}_V \\lesssim -13$) is regulated primarily by supernova feedback; (2) the faint end of the luminosity function is shaped by the interplay between feedback and reionisation; and (3) the mass-metallicity relation is governed almost exclusively by feedback at all masses. We are unable to find a combination of parameters in the fiducial model that fits the observed data for both statistics simultaneously. To understand why, we employ SHapley Additive exPlanations to capture the directionality of each parameter variation. This enables us to pinpoint the origin of tensions in the model, showing that parameter adjustments that regulate the abundance of faint satellites drive stellar metallicities to be an order of magnitude too low and vice versa. This internal \"tug-of-war\" leads us to consider extensions to the baseline model, such as metal loading in winds, or allowing the feedback strength to evolve with redshift. Our study highlights the value of interrogating complex physical models through a sensitivity analysis framework by revealing high-order parameter interactions and non-linear responses that traditional one-at-a-time variations would miss.",

Comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We report the discovery of a faint (M_1700 ~ -12.2), oxygen-deficient strongly-lensed ionizing source -- dubbed LAP2 (Lensed And Pristine 2) -- at a spectroscopic redshift of z=4.19. LAP2 appears to be isolated and lies very close to the caustic produced by the lensing galaxy cluster Abell 2744. It was observed with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec MSA in prism mode as part of the UNCOVER program. The NIRSpec spectrum reveals prominent Lya emission (7.1 sigma), clear Ha emission (6.2 sigma), tentative Hb emission (2.8 sigma), and no detectable [OIII]4959,5007 (~ 7 times fainter than Ha). The inferred [OIII] 2 sigma upper limit corresponds to an R3 index <0.85 (assuming the Ha/Hb ~ 2.86 case~B recombination ratio), which, under high-ionization conditions, implies a metallicity of Z < 6 X 10^(-3) Z_sun. The combination of faint ultraviolet luminosity, large rest-frame Ha equivalent width (~ 650 A), and extremely compact size (< 10 pc) suggests that LAP2 is being caught in an early, pristine formation phase consistent with an instantaneous-burst scenario, with an estimated stellar mass of at most a few 10^4 Msun. Deep VLT/MUSE observations further reveal copious Lya emission forming an arclet that straddles the critical line. LAP2 thus joins the rare class of extremely metal-poor star-forming complexes that JWST has started to unveil at redshifts 3 - 7, and provides a rare glimpse into a still very poorly explored faint-luminosity regime.",

Hunt, N úria Miret-Roig, Stefan Meingast, Torsten Möller Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We studied 12 disk streams found in a 250$^3$ pc$^3$ volume in the solar neighborhood, which we define as coeval and comoving stellar structures with aspect ratios greater than 3:1. Using \\emph{Gaia} Data Release 3 data and the advanced clustering algorithms \\texttt{SigMA} and \\texttt{Uncover}, we identified and characterized these streams beyond the search volume, doubling, on average, their known populations.

These estimates surpass N-body estimates by one to two orders of magnitude and challenge the prevailing understanding of their destruction mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that these 12 disk streams are dynamically cold with 3D velocity dispersions between 2 and 5\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$, exhibit narrow sequences in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and are highly elongated with average aspect ratios of 7:1, extending up to several hundred parsecs. We find evidence suggesting that one of the disk streams, currently embedded in the Scorpius-Centaurus association, is experiencing disruption, likely due to the primordial gas mass of the association.",

We consider the role that the numerical resolution plays in the modelling of these systems by studying the stripping of satellites in the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations. We focus on host haloes of total halo mass $M_\\mathrm{200c}=10^{12-15}M_{\\odot}$ and satellites of stellar mass $>10^{7}$$M_{\\odot}$, and compare stellar halo / satellite properties across 9 IllustrisTNG runs with baryonic particle mass resolution between $8.5\\times10^4M_{\\odot}$ and $7\\times10^8$$M_{\\odot}$, using a Lagrangian-region technique to identify counterpart satellites across different resolution simulations of the same volume. We publish the corresponding catalogues alongside this paper. We demonstrate that the stripping of DM from satellites that orbit in group- and cluster-mass hosts is largely independent of resolution at least until 90 per cent of their initial mass at infall has been stripped. We do not find evidence for spurious disruption of galaxies due to insufficient resolution for the satellite masses we consider. By contrast, the stripping of stellar mass is strongly resolution-dependent: each factor of 8 improvement in particle stellar mass typically adds 2~Gyr to the stripping time. Improved numerical resolution within the IllustrisTNG model generally results in more compact satellites with larger stellar masses, which in turn generate more centrally concentrated stellar haloes and intra-cluster mass profiles. However, the concomitant increase in stellar mass of both satellites and hosts may still be the cause for the overprediction of the stellar halo mass at large host radii relative to observations seen in some previous studies.",

Ostriker 25 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We analyze an ensemble of simulated prestellar cores to facilitate interpretation of structure, kinematics, and lifetime of observed cores. While our theory predicts a \"characteristic\" density for star formation, it also predicts that the individual critical density varies among cores; any observed sample thus contains cores at various evolutionary stages within a given density bin. By analyzing the remaining lifetime, we find cores undergoing quasi-equilibrium collapse evolve on a timescale of twice the freefall time throughout most of their life. Our analysis shows that the central column density and the associated full-width half maximum provide a reasonably accurate observational estimator of the central volume density, and therefore the freefall time; this does, however require resolving the central column density plateau. Observations with a finite beam size tend to underestimate densities of evolved cores, and this makes observed lifetimes appear to decrease more steeply than the apparent freefall time. We measure from our simulations the ratio of prestellar duration to envelope infall time, and find this is consistent with the observed relative number of prestellar cores and embedded protostars. Yet, the absolute core lifetime in our simulations is significantly shorter than would be expected from empirical measurements of the relative numbers of prestellar cores and Class II sources; we discuss several possible reasons for this discrepancy. Finally, our simulated cores have nearly constant line-of-sight velocity dispersion within the emitting region in the sky plane, resembling observed \"coherent cores.\" We show that this \"coherence\" is a consequence of projection effects, which mask the intrinsic power-law velocity structure function. We discuss possible ways to estimate line-of-sight path lengths.",

Pearlman, Mawson Sammons, Kaitlyn Shin, Kendrick Smith, Haochen Wang 28 pages, 9 figures, submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Fast radio bursts (FRBs) provide a sensitive probe of diffuse baryons: their dispersion measures (DMs) measure electron density independent of temperature and scale linearly with gas density. This makes them particularly well suited to studying the intragroup medium (IGrM), where traditional probes such as X-ray emission and the SZ effect are weak. Evidence suggests that the baryon content of group mass halos ($M_{500}\\sim10^{13}-10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$) is strongly affected by galactic feedback, creating deviations from cluster scaling relations. Three FRBs from the first CHIME/FRB Outrigger sample come from host galaxies found within or behind galaxy clusters and groups. Using integrated halo density models, we estimate the DM contribution of each ICM/IGrM, accounting for uncertainties in halo mass and the distance to the host galaxy relative to the cluster center. For the more massive halos, predicted cluster DMs agree with the extragalactic DM budget. One burst, FRB 20230703A, intersects three groups yet has a low extragalactic DM. By comparing model predictions with the measured DM, we constrain the baryon fraction $f_g(R)$ in these halos. Comparing with published $M-f_g$ relations, we find consistency with recent eROSITA results at $R_{500}$, mild tension at $R_{200}$, and strong tensions with earlier X-ray-based relations. As CHIME/FRB Outriggers build a large catalog of localized FRBs, many additional sightlines through groups and clusters will be obtained. These will enable systematic tests of intragroup and intracluster gas properties and sharpen constraints on the distribution of baryons in massive halos.",

Gentile, C. Gruppioni, F. Pozzi, G. Zamorani Submitted to A&A Letter. 4 pages + Appendix Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a puzzling population of extragalactic sources whose origin is highly debated. In this Letter, we stack NIRCam, MIRI and ALMA images of a large and homogeneously-selected sample of LRDs from multiple JWST Legacy fields. We find clear evidence for hot-dust emission, seen as a rising mid-infrared continuum up to rest-frame $\\lambda_{\\rm rest}$$\\sim$ 3$\\mu$m, that is best explained by a standard dusty AGN structure. This scenario holds regardless of whether the Optical/Ultraviolet (UV) continuum is stellar or AGN-dominated. Either ways, we argue that AGN-heated dust must have a geometry that leaves at least part of the Optical/UV continuum and broad-line region emission unobscured, which explains the observed blue UV slopes and prominent Balmer features. Lack of detections in the deep stack of X-ray images suggests that Compton-thick ($N_{\\rm H}$$>$3$\\times$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) gas obscuration is common, and likely confined within the dust sublimation radius ($R$$_{\\rm sub}$$\\sim$0.1 pc). While this gas-dust displacement is in line with recent models (e.g. the ``Black Hole Star''), how pre-enriched hot dust can form around a nearly-pristine black hole environment remains to be explained.",

MN-24-1207-MJ.R3 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We study the infrared/radio correlation of galaxies in the IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample using new MeerKAT observations at $\\rm\\nu = 1.28\\, GHz$, complemented with VLA data. We classify the objects by primary energy source (Active Galactic Nuclei vs. Star-Forming) and take into account their merger status. With this, we aim to explore the effect of galaxy-galaxy interaction on the total-infrared (TIR)/radio correlation ($q_\\mathrm{TIR}$) of star-forming galaxies by comparing the $q_\\mathrm{TIR}$ distribution between isolated and interacting/merging sources. We found the median $q_\\mathrm{TIR}$ to be $2.61 \\pm 0.01$ (scatter = 0.16) for isolated galaxies and $2.51 \\pm 0.08$ (scatter = 0.26) for interacting/merging galaxies. Our analysis reveals that interacting/merging galaxies exhibit lower $q_\\mathrm{TIR}$ and higher dispersion compared to isolated galaxies, and the difference is marginally significant. Interacting/merging galaxies have redder $W2-W3$ colours, higher star formation rates (SFR) and specific SFR compared to isolated objects. We observe a significant decrease in $q_\\mathrm{TIR}$ with increasing radio luminosity for isolated galaxies. Additionally, we find the median ratio of TIR ($8 \\,\\mu m < \\lambda < 1000\\, \\mu m$) to far-infrared (FIR; $40 \\,\\mu m < \\lambda < 120\\, \\mu m$) luminosities to be $\\left<L_\\mathrm{TIR}/L_\\mathrm{FIR}\\right>\\approx2.29$. By examining the relation between $L_\\mathrm{TIR}$ and the mid-infrared (MIR) star-formation rate indicator ($L_\\mathrm{12\\,\\mu m}$) employed for our interacting/merging sample, we note a strong and consistent (similar non-linear behaviour) relationship between the TIR/radio and TIR/MIR ratios. Finally, we show that already at $z<0.1$, $q_\\mathrm{TIR}$ exhibits a dependence on stellar mass, with more massive galaxies displaying a lower $q_\\mathrm{TIR}$.",

Talbot, Maria Werhahn, Christoph Pfrommer, Volker Springel Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Cosmic rays (CRs) are a non-thermal energy component in the interstellar and circumgalactic medium (CGM) that can act as an additional feedback channel beyond thermal and kinetic feedback from stars and AGN. They influence galaxy evolution by altering gas properties, regulating star formation, and shaping galactic outflows. We investigate these effects using a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations, which incorporate CR transport and feedback on top of the Auriga galaxy formation model. Our simulations span a wide range of halo masses, from dwarf galaxies to small groups ($M_{200\\mathrm{c}}= 10^{10} - 10^{13}~\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$), allowing us to assess the mass-dependent impact of CRs in a cosmological setting. We find that CRs have the strongest impact in lower-mass galaxies ($M_{200\\mathrm{c}} < 10^{12}~\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$), where they suppress star formation rates by up to 50\\%, reduce gas and stellar half-light radii, and drive outflows that reach higher velocities at the virial radius compared to simulations without CRs. These CR-enhanced outflows also transport more metals and magnetic fields into the CGM, leading to higher CGM metallicities, stronger magnetisation, and lower CGM temperatures. In more massive galaxies, CRs do not significantly affect star formation or outflow properties, likely because thermal and kinetic feedback from stars and AGN dominate in this regime. However, CRs still influence galaxy morphology across all halo masses by reducing the gas half-mass radius and stellar half-light radius. Finally, variations in CR transport properties, such as different diffusion coefficients or the exclusion of Alfvén cooling, significantly affect star formation, CGM properties, and outflows in lower-mass galaxies. This sensitivity makes these galaxies key environments for testing CR transport models and refining our understanding of their role in galaxy evolution.",

To investigate these conditions, we perform a suite of N-body simulations of bulgeless disk galaxies with stellar masses in the range $10^9 \\leq M_d \\leq 10^{11} \\;M_\\odot$. Our galaxy models are constructed based on the observed properties of nearby barred galaxies from the S4G survey, and we systematically vary the halo scale radius to isolate its dynamical influence. Bars in our simulations form via repeated swing amplifications of disk perturbations, sustained by feedback loops. The amplification factor $\\Gamma$ depends on both the Toomre stability parameter $Q_T$ and the dimensionless wavelength $X$. Based on our simulation results, we propose a two-parameter bar formation criterion, $Q_T + 0.4(X - 1.4)^2 \\leq 1.8$, corresponding to $\\Gamma = 10$, which better captures the onset of bar formation than traditional one-parameter conditions. Bars in low-mass galaxies tend to be shorter and weaker, and are more susceptible to disruption by outer spiral arms. In contrast, bars in high-mass galaxies are longer, stronger, and more resilient to spiral interference. Bars in low-mass galaxies undergo only slight vertical thickening over time, whereas those in high-mass galaxies thicken rapidly via buckling instability.",

Nuñez-Castiñeyra, E. Nezri, P. Mollitor, L. Michel-Dansac, J. Devriendt, R. Teyssier Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate the role of baryonic physics in shaping the population, structure, and internal dynamics of galactic subhalos using the Mochima suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations. A refined method is developed to identify bound subhalo material by isolating the local gravitational potential and applying multi-criteria phase-space selection. This approach enables a robust characterisation of subhalo properties across five baryonic runs with varying prescriptions for star formation, and supernova and protostellar feedback, as well as a dark matter-only baseline. At the population level, we find that host halo concentration, modulated by baryonic feedback, is a key predictor of subhalo survival. Subhalos with more massive stellar components exhibit deeper internal potentials and enhanced resilience to tidal disruption. At the structural level, we identify a broad diversity in inner dark matter profiles, consistent with observations of dwarf galaxies. We show that this diversity correlates with both star formation history and environmental interaction. In particular, galaxies that form most of their stars early tend to retain steep cusps, while those with extended or recent star formation exhibit oscillating inner slopes shaped by bursty feedback and tidal perturbations. These findings suggest that the so-called \"diversity problem\" may reflect the complex interplay between feedback history and gravitational environment, rather than a breakdown of cold dark matter predictions.",

Richards, Leah K. Morabito Accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) While C IV is the most common absorption line in Broad Absorption Line Quasar spectra, Balmer absorption lines are among the rarest. We present analysis of Balmer absorption in a sample of fourteen iron low-ionization BAL quasars (FeLoBALQs); eight are new identifications. We measured velocity offset, width, and apparent optical depth. The partial covering ubiquitous in BAL quasar spectra alters the measured Balmer optical depth ratios; taking that into account, we estimated the true H(n= 2) column density. We found the anticipated correlation between Eddington ratio and outflow speed, but it is weak in this sample because nearly all of the objects have the low outflow speeds characterizing loitering outflow FeLoBAL quasars (H. Choi et al. 2022b), objects that are also found to have low accretion rates (K. M. Leighly et al. 2022; H. Choi et al. 2022a). Measures of dN/dv, the differential column density with respect to the outflow speed, are anticorrelated with the luminosity and Eddington ratio: the strongest absorption is observed at the lowest speeds in the lowest luminosity objects. The absorption line width is correlated with {\\alpha}oi, the F{\\lambda} point-to-point slope between 5100A and 3 microns. This parameter is strongly correlated with the Eddington ratio among low-redshift quasars (K. M. Leighly et al. 2024). Balmer absorption lines have been recently found in the spectra of Little Red Dots (LRDs), a class of high-redshift objects discovered by JWST. We note suggestive similarities between LRDs and FeLoBAL quasars in the emission line shape, the presence of steep reddening and a scattered blue continuum, the lack of hot dust emission, and X-ray weakness.",

E(B$-$V)$_{\\rm LAMOST}$ values of $\\sim$ 4.6 million unique sources were obtained with the standard-pair analysis using LAMOST DR11 stellar parameters and synthesized $B/V$-band photometry from $Gaia$ XP spectra, showing a typical precision of $\\sim$ 0.01 mag. The E(B$-$V)$_{\\rm XP}$ from the catalog of \\citet{zhang2023}, which was derived using forward modeling of $Gaia$ XP spectra, were cross-validated with E(B$-$V)$_{\\rm LAMOST}$, leading to the selection of $\\sim$ 150 million high-reliability measurements. The combined dataset achieves a median precision of $\\sim$ 0.03 mag for E(B$-$V). To model the reddening -- distance relationship along various lines-of-sight, we implemented a parametric approach that accounts for contributions from the local bubble, diffuse interstellar-medium, and multiple potential molecular clouds. The sky was adaptively partitioned based on stellar density, resulting in angular resolutions ranging from 3.4$^{\\prime}$ to 58$^{\\prime}$, with about half of the sky having a resolution better than 6.9$^{\\prime}$. The reddening precision of our 3D map for individual stars reaches $\\sim$ 0.01 mag in most regions at $|b| > 20^\\circ$, but degrades to 0.01-0.05 mag at $|b| < 20^\\circ$.

Here we present an all-sky catalog of 3,345 molecular clouds identified from our previous three-dimensional dust reddening map using a dendrogram-based clustering method with distance-adaptive parameters. The catalog spans heliocentric distances from 90 pc to 4.3 kpc and includes key physical properties for each cloud, including position, size, mass, surface density, and dust density. Approximately 650 clouds in our catalog are associated with the boundary of the Local Bubble, while around 740 clouds (excluding those associated with the Local Bubble) are located at high Galactic latitudes ($|b| > 20^\\circ$). The spatial distribution of the cataloged clouds reveals prominent large-scale features in the Galactic disk, including coherent spur-like structures, large-scale cavities, and a more detailed view of the Local Bubble shell. These findings refine our understanding of how molecular clouds trace the Galactic spiral arm network and provide new insight into the spatial structure of the Local Bubble.

Regan 5 pages, 2 figures, submitted to the Open Journal of Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) JWST has identified some of the Universe's earliest galaxies, repeatedly pushing the frontier to ever higher redshifts and stellar masses. The presence of such extreme galaxies at such early times, with large stellar populations and high star-formation rates, naturally results in a tension between observation and theory. This tension between numerical models and observations can be either due to our underlying cosmological models or due to a gap in our understanding of early Universe astrophysics. In a prelude to this letter, we showed how the Renaissance simulations, which focused on high redshift galaxy formation were able to reconstruct similar stellar masses to the earliest and highest mass galaxies that had been discovered by JWST at the time of its publication (McCaffrey et al.2023). Since then many more galaxies have been discovered by JWST, in particular the \"Mirage-or-Miracle\" (MoM) survey broke the record recently with the highest redshift galaxy MoM-z14, which has a spectroscopically confirmed redshift of $z \\sim 14.44$ followed closely by GS-z14 with a spectroscopically confirmed redshift of $z \\sim 14.3$. We investigate in this letter whether these newly discovered galaxies are in conflict with the Renaissance simulations and thus whether they are causing tension with our established models of cosmology and/or high-redshift astrophysics. We discover that MoM-z14's high mass at early redshift can be explained by the Renaissance simulation suite, whereas the extremely high stellar mass of GS-z14 remains an outlier when compared to previous measurements of high-redshift galaxies detected by JWST and our numerical models (even after accounting for cosmic variance).",

We obtain members belonging to several known substructures: the Sagittarius stream, Galactic Anticenter Substructure (GASS), Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES), Splash, and the high-{\\alpha} disk. Furthermore, we also identify two groups which cannot be clearly asso-ciated with previously known substructures. Our findings confirm the existence of metal-rich constituents within the GES, representing newly formed stars that originated from the metal-enriched gas delivered during the GES merger event and subsequently evolved. Additionally, this study further expands the sample of GASS, high-{\\alpha} disk, and Splash stars. Analysis of these metal-rich M giant stars as members of the GES, Splash, and high-{\\alpha} disk compo-nents supports an evolution scenario for the early Milky Way, as proposed by previous stud-ies. In this scenario, stars initially formed in a high-{\\alpha} primordial disk were dynamically heated by the massive accretion event (GES). This process redistributed stellar orbits, creat-ing the Splash population, while the undisturbed portion of the primordial disk persisted as the present-day high-{\\alpha} disk component.",

Submitted to MNRAS, comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) NGC 5253 is a nearby (D=3.6 Mpc) Blue Compact Dwarf galaxy, notable for its three massive young super star clusters (SSCs) and nitrogen enrichment. Its similarity to extreme star-forming galaxies at high redshift makes it a good local analogue for studying chemical enrichment at high spatial resolution. We characterise the ionised gas and dust in the giant HII region in the proximity of the three SSCs in the centre of NGC 5253 using new Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer Narrow Field Mode adaptive optics-assisted data at unprecedented spatial resolution of 0.\"15$\\sim$2.3 pc. We derive the attenuation for the central SSCs and, for the first time, map the extinction parameter ($R_V$) in an extragalactic object. $R_V$ varies among SSCs, suggesting differences in dust physics. Electron temperature and density diagnostics yield flat temperature distributions $T_\\mathrm{e,median}$([NII])$=12000 \\pm 1700$ K and $T_\\mathrm{e,median}$([SIII])$ = 11000 \\pm 600$ K, and a structured $n_e$([SII]) of maximum $1930 \\pm 40$ cm$^{-3}$. The direct method gives a flat helium abundance ($10^3y^+ = 81 \\pm 4$) and uniform oxygen abundance ($12 + \\log(\\text{O/H}) = 8.22 \\pm 0.05$). N/O shows a factor 2-3 enhancement around the SSCs, mapped here for the first time at such high spatial resolution. The total excess nitrogen mass is $\\sim$0.3 $M_\\odot$, which we estimate is producible by the observed WN-type Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Because there is no direct spatial overlap between the enrichment and WR star positions, the N-rich material appears to have been expelled from the original sites.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We measure and compare the size of the dusty torus with active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity and the size of the broad-line region (BLR), using a sample of 182 AGNs with the best H$\\beta$ lag measurements. After correcting for accretion-disk contamination, torus sizes are determined from the time lags of the WISE W1 and W2 band light curves relative to the optical band variability based on the interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF) analysis and the Multiple and Inhomogeneous Component Analysis (MICA). We find that the torus size from the W1-band (W2-band) tightly correlates with the 5100~Å continuum luminosity with an intrinsic scatter of 0.15-0.16 dex and the best-fit slope of $0.35 \\pm 0.03$ ($0.33 \\pm 0.03$), which is clearly shallower than the expected 0.5 slope from the sublimation radius-luminosity relation. We find a moderate negative trend that higher Eddington AGNs tend to have smaller torus sizes than expected from the best-fit, suggesting the Eddington ratio plays a role in flattening the torus size-luminosity relation. By comparing the torus size with the H$\\beta$ reverberation time lag for a subsample of 67 AGNs, we find that the torus size is a factor of $\\sim 10$ and $\\sim 14$ larger than the BLR size, respectively for W1 and W2 bands. The torus size based on the W1 (W2) band correlates with the BLR size with the best-fit slope of $1.26 \\pm 0.17$ ($1.10 \\pm 0.16$), which is comparable but slightly steeper than a linear correlation.",

      "abstract": "Disclosing Submillimeter Galaxy Formation: Mergers or Secular Evolution? Siu-Wang Chan, Yiping Ao, Qinghua Tan Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We analyze the morphology of 125 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the PRIMER-COSMOS field using double Sersic modeling on JWST NIRCam images across six bands (F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M and F444W), with SMGs being classified by bulge Sersic index (n_bulge) and bulge-to-total luminosity ratio (B/T). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between the bright (SFR > 175 M_sun yr^{-1}) and the faint group (SFR < 175 M_sun yr^{-1}) reveals no significant statistical differences in morphology across bands. However, we notice that SMGs skew towards higher B/T ratios and lower n_bulge from shorter to longer wavelengths. In F444W, bright SMGs exhibit higher B/T and lower n_bulge, indicating flatter, disturbed bulges, while faint SMGs show lower B/T and higher n_bulge. Notably, SMGs with higher B/T tend to have low Sersic index, challenging the local universe dichotomy of classical bulges (B/T > 0.5, n > 4) versus pseudo-bulges (B/T < 0.35, n < 2). In the F277W band, non-parametric measurements indicate predominantly disk-dominated patterns, with only 24 percent of SMGs demonstrating merger signatures. After the removal of SMGs with disturbed morphology, the bulge classification scheme in F277W shows pseudo-bulges (21 percent) and clump migration bulges (16 percent) from secular evolution, compared to 4 percent merger-built bulges. Surprisingly, 48 percent of SMGs defy the classification scheme, showing high B/T (approximately 0.7) but low Sersic index (n_bulge <= 1). Bars are confirmed in 7 percent of SMGs. This work suggests that secular evolution takes precedence over major mergers, supporting the idea that isolated evolution fueled by filamentary gas inflow plays a non-negligible role in the SMG bulge formation.",

Trayford 36 pages; submitted to MNRAS; images, videos, and interactive visualizations are available on the COLIBRE website at this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) and star formation rates (SFRs) across cosmic time in the COLIBRE simulations of galaxy formation. COLIBRE includes a multiphase interstellar medium, radiative cooling rates coupled to a model for the evolution of dust grains, and employs prescriptions for stellar and AGN feedback calibrated to reproduce the $z=0$ observed GSMF and stellar mass - size relation. We present the evolution of the GSMF from simulations at three resolutions: $m_{\\rm gas}\\approx m_{\\rm dm}\\sim 10^7$, $10^6$, and $10^5~\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$, in cosmological volumes of up to $400^3$, $200^3$, and $50^3$ cMpc$^3$, respectively. We demonstrate that COLIBRE is consistent with the observed GSMF over the full redshift range for which there are observations to compare with ($0<z<12$), with maximum systematic deviations of $\\approx 0.3$ dex reached at $2<z<4$. We also examine the evolution of the star-forming main sequence, cosmic SFR density, stellar mass density, and galaxy quenched fraction, making predictions for both the fiducial COLIBRE model with thermally-driven AGN feedback and its variant with hybrid (thermal + kinetic jet) AGN feedback, and finding good agreement with observations. Notably, we show that COLIBRE matches the number density of massive quiescent galaxies at high redshifts reported by JWST, while predicting a stellar-to-halo mass relation that evolves little with redshift. We conclude that neither a redshift-dependent star formation efficiency, nor a variable stellar initial mass function, nor a deviation from $\\Lambda\\mathrm{CDM}$ is necessary to reproduce the high-redshift JWST stellar masses and SFRs.",

Hansen 14 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in A&A on August 28, 2025 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a comprehensive spectroscopic and kinematic analysis of the very metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -2.60 $\\pm$ 0.20 dex) giant star HE2159-0551. By investigating the star's chemodynamic characteristics, we seek to address its formation, evolution, and role in the chemical enrichment of the early cosmos and the possible connection to known merger events. From high-resolution data we perform a one dimension, local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis using PyMoogi. We conduct a detailed abundance analysis of 23 elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, and Eu), allowing us to derive abundances or place limits. Finally, we compute orbital parameters to investigate the kinematics and thus the nucleosynthetic origin of HE2159-0551. The analysis yields significant insights into the chemical composition of HE2159-0551, highlighting its peculiarities among very metal-poor stars. The star shows signs of internal mixing and a peculiar abundance pattern, particular regarding the heavy elements. We find a low Ba abundance (s-process element) and a suppressed contamination of r-process elements, even though r-process enrichment may be expected in very metal-poor stars. The orbital parameters and kinematic properties indicate that HE2159-0551 is a thick disc star, connected to the old and metal-poor LMS-1/Wukong progenitor resulting from an early merger. Our kinematic analysis suggests a potential connection of HE2159-0551 to the merger LMS-1/Wukong. We conclude that the nucleosynthesis processes responsible for the star's enrichment in heavy elements are different from those observed in many other metal-poor stars as neither the main r- nor s-process can explain the derived abundance pattern. A possible weak-r or $\\nu$p-process forming Sr-Zr but not Ba might have mixed into a low level of underlying r-process material in the low-mass LMS-1/Wukong system.",

Its unusually high excess velocity and active cometary nature make it a key probe of the Galactic population of icy planetesimals. Understanding its origin requires tracing its past trajectory through the Galaxy and assessing the possible role of stellar encounters, both as a potential origin and a perturber to its orbit. We integrated the orbit of 3I/ATLAS backward in time for 10 Myr, together with a sample of Gaia DR3 stars with high-quality astrometry and radial velocities, to identify close passages within 2 pc. We identify 93 nominal encounters, 62 of which are significant at the $2\\sigma$ level. However, none of these encounters produced any meaningful perturbation. The strongest perturber Gaia DR3 6863591389529611264 at 0.30 pc and with a relative velocity of 35 km s$^{-1}$, imparted only a velocity change of $|\\Delta v| \\simeq 5\\times10^{-4}$ km s$^{-1}$ to the orbit of 3I/ATLAS.

On time scales beyond a few rotation periods, these light curves are typically stochastic. The variability arises from a combination of accretion rate changes, line-of-sight extinction variations, and evolving spotted stellar surfaces. We aim to develop a methodology to quantitatively compare the full variability statistics of these inhomogeneously sampled light curves with model calculations. To achieve this, we converted the light curves into variability fingerprints. They map the probability of variation by a given amount over a given timescale. Applying principal component analysis to these fingerprints produces a stable distribution of the first two principal components. We show that this distribution is a continuum without clusters. Adding a model-generated fingerprint to an observational sample does not significantly alter the distribution of the sample, allowing a robust comparison between the model and observed light curves to assess statistical realism. We show that photometric uncertainties, timing, and observing cadence have a minimal impact on model placement within the observational distribution. The main source of variance among highly variable light curves of young stars is the timescale of the onset of significant variability (above 0.3mag), with 1-3month timescales being the most critical. The secondary cause of variance are long-term (above 1.5yr) dimming or rising trends.",

This type of anti-tail, not a result of perspective, may not have been previously observed. We explain the anti-tail as an anisotropic extension of the snow line, or survival radius of a sublimating ice grain, in the direction of the Sun. The anisotropy is due to the difference in the sublimation mass flux in the solar and perpendicular directions caused by the change in the illumination angle of the cometary surface. The stronger sublimation mass flux in the solar direction results in ice grains with larger sizes, longer sublimation lifetimes, and a snow line at a larger radial distance with respect to other directions. The observed radial surface brightness profiles as a function of illumination angle are well reproduced by a Haser-type spherical outflow with constant velocity and sublimating ice grains with angularly dependent survival lengths.",

Accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) In a hierarchically formed Universe, galaxies accrete smaller systems that tidally disrupt as they evolve in the host's potential. We present a complete catalogue of disrupting galaxies accreted onto Milky Way-mass haloes from the Auriga suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamic zoom-in simulations. We classify accretion events as intact satellites, stellar streams, or phase-mixed systems based on automated criteria calibrated to a visually classified sample, and match accretions to their counterparts in haloes re-simulated at higher resolution. Most satellites with a bound progenitor at the present day have lost substantial amounts of stellar mass -- 67 per cent have $f_\\text{bound} < 0.97$ (our threshold of lost stellar mass to no longer be considered intact), while 53 per cent satisfy a more stringent $f_\\text{bound} < 0.8$. Streams typically outnumber intact systems, contribute a smaller fraction of overall accreted stars, and are substantial contributors at intermediate distances from the host centre ($\\sim$0.1 to $\\sim$0.7$R_\\text{200m}$, or $\\sim$35 to $\\sim$250 kpc for the Milky Way). We also identify accretion events that disrupt to form streams around massive intact satellites instead of the main host. Streams are more likely than intact or phase-mixed systems to have experienced preprocessing, suggesting this mechanism is important for setting disruption rates around Milky Way-mass haloes. All of these results are preserved across different simulation resolutions, though we do find some hints that satellites disrupt more readily at lower resolution. The Auriga haloes suggest that disrupting satellites surrounding Milky Way-mass galaxies are the norm and that a wealth of tidal features waits to be uncovered in upcoming surveys.",

Related scripts and data available at this https URL and this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The conservation of stellar actions is a fundamental assumption in orbit reconstruction studies in the Milky Way. However, the disc is highly dynamic, with time-dependent, non-axisymmetric features like transient spiral arms and giant molecular clouds (GMCs) driving local fluctuations in the gravitational potential on top of the near-axisymmetric background. Using high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations that incorporate gas dynamics and star formation, we quantify the rate at which these effects drive non-conservation of the actions of young stars from Myr to Gyr timescales. We find that action evolution is well described as a logarithmic random walk, with vertical action evolving more rapidly than radial action; the diffusion rate associated with this random walk is weakly dependent on the stellar birth environment and scales approximately linearly with the galactic orbital frequency at a star's position. The diffusion rates we measure imply a fundamental limit of $\\sim 100$ Myr as the timescale over which stellar orbits can be reliably reconstructed using methods that assume action conservation. By comparing diffusion rates for younger stars to those measured for an older and more vertically-extended control population, we conclude that radial action evolution is driven primarily by transient spiral arms, while vertical action evolution is driven by gravitational scattering off gaseous structures. Our results have significant implications for galactic archaeology and disc dynamics studies, necessitating a closer look at the timescales over which actions are assumed to be conserved in the disc.",

Modified after first referee revision Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Determining the dynamical mass profiles of dispersion-supported galaxies is particularly challenging due to projection effects and the unknown shape of their velocity anisotropy profile. Our goal is to develop a machine learning algorithm capable of recovering dynamical mass profiles of dispersion-supported galaxies from line-of-sight stellar data. Traditionally, this task relies on time-consuming methods that require profile parameterization and assume dynamical equilibrium and spherical symmetry. We train a convolutional neural network model using various sets of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies. By extracting projected stellar data from the simulated galaxies and feeding it into the model, we obtain the posterior distribution of the dynamical mass profile at ten different radii. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of existing literature mass estimators on our dataset. Our model achieves more accurate results than any literature mass estimator while also providing enclosed mass estimates at radii where no previous estimators exist. We confirm that the posterior distributions produced by the model are well-calibrated, ensuring they provide meaningful uncertainties. However, issues remain, as the method loses performance when trained on one set of simulations and applied to another, highlighting the importance of improving the generalization of ML methods trained on specific galaxy simulations.",

PICZL code (Roster et al. 2024) used for computing the photo-z, is also released Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) To better understand the role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxy evolution, it is crucial to achieve a complete and pure AGN census. X-ray surveys are key to this, but identifying their counterparts (CTPs) at other wavelengths remains challenging due to their larger positional uncertainties and limited availability of deeper, uniform ancillary data. Euclid is revolutionising this effort, offering extensive coverage of nearly the entire extragalactic sky, particularly in the near-infrared bands, where AGN are more easily detected. With the first Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1), we identifyed, classifyed, and determined the redshifts of Euclid CTPs to known point-like sources from major X-ray surveys, including XMM-Newton, Chandra, and eROSITA. Using Bayesian statistics, combined with machine learning (ML), we identify the CTPs to 11 286 X-ray sources from the three X-ray telescopes. For the large majority of 10 194 sources, the associations are unique, with the remaining $\\sim$ 10% of multi-CTP cases equally split between XMM-Newton and eROSITA. ML is then used to distinguish between Galactic (8%) and extragalactic (92%) sources. We computed photo-zs using deep learning for the 8617 sources detected in the 10th data release of the DESI Legacy Survey, reaching an accuracy and a fraction of outliers of about 5%. Based on their X-ray luminosities, over 99% of CTPs identified as extragalactic are classified as AGN, most of which appear unobscured given their hardness ratios. With this paper, we release our catalogue, which includes identifiers, basic X-ray properties, the details of the associations, and additional features such as Galactic/extragalactic classifications and photometric/spectroscopic redshifts. We also provide probabilities for sub-selecting the sample based on purity and completeness, allowing users to tailor the sample according to their specific needs.",

Using NIRCam images, we identified it as a bright outlier in the $F200W-F356W$ color vs $F356W$ magnitude diagram of point sources in the field. The NIRCam/WFSS spectrum reveals the emission from HeI$\\lambda 10830$ and PaG line, both showing a narrow and a broad ($FWHM\\gtrsim 2000\\ \\rm kms^{-1}$) component. The HeI line is affected by an absorption feature, tracing dense gas with HeI column density in the $2^3S$ level $N\\sim 0.5-1.2\\times 10^{14}\\rm cm^{-2}$, depending on the location of the absorber, which is outflowing at the speed of $\\Delta v \\sim -830\\ \\rm kms^{-1}$. As observed in the majority of LRDs, BiRD does not show X-ray or radio emission. The BH mass and the bolometric luminosity, both inferred from the PaG broad component, amount to $M_{\\rm BH}\\sim 10^8\\rm M_{\\odot}$ and $L_{\\rm bol}\\sim 2.9\\times 10^{45}\\rm ergs^{-1}$, respectively. Intriguingly, BiRD presents strict analogies with other two LRDs spectroscopically confirmed at cosmic noon, GN-28074 (\"Rosetta Stone\") at $z=2.26$ and RUBIES-BLAGN-1 at $z=3.1$. The blueshifted HeI absorption detected in all three sources suggests that gas outflows may be common in LRDs. We derive a first estimate of the space density of LRDs at $z<3$ based on JWST data, as a function of $L_{\\rm bol}$ and BH mass. The space density is only a factor of $\\sim 2-3$ lower than that of UV-selected quasars with comparable $L_{\\rm bol}$ and $z$, meaning that the contribution of LRDs to the broader AGN population is also relevant at cosmic noon. A similar trend is also observed in terms of BH masses. If, as suggested by recent theories, LRDs probe the very first and rapid growth of black hole seeds, our finding may suggest that the formation of black hole seeds remains efficient at least up to cosmic noon.",

The resulting variations in the abundance and properties of interstellar dust have important implications for how accurately we can trace the chemical enrichment of the universe over cosmic time. Multi-object UV spectroscopy with HWO can provide the large samples of abundance and dust depletion measurements needed to understand how the abundance and properties of interstellar dust vary within and between galaxies, thereby observationally addressing important questions about chemical enrichment and galaxy evolution. Medium-resolution (R~50,000) spectroscopy in the full UV range (950-3150 A) toward massive stars in Local Volume galaxies (D < 10 Mpc) will enable gas- and dust-phase abundance measurements of key elements, such as Fe, Si, Mg, S, Zn. These measurements will provide an estimate of how the dust abundance varies with environment, in particular metallicity and gas density. However, measuring the carbon and oxygen contents of dust requires very high resolution (R > 100,000) and high signal-to-noise (S/N > 100) owing to the non-saturated UV transitions for those elements being extremely weak. Since carbon and oxygen in the neutral ISM contribute the largest metal mass reservoir for dust, it is critical that the HWO design include a grating similar to the HST STIS H gratings providing very high resolution, as well as FUV and NUV detectors capable of reaching very high S/N.",

The 2D (razor-thin) case Walter Dehnen 11+5 pages (main+appendices), final version (past language editing) A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) I developed an efficient numerical method for obtaining the gravitational potential of razor-thin spiral perturbations and used it to assess the standard tight-winding approximation, which is found to be reasonably accurate for pitch angles $\\alpha\\lesssim20^\\circ$. I derived the analytic potential of razor-thin logarithmic spirals with an arbitrary power-law amplitude. Approximating a spiral locally by one of these models provides a second-order tight-winding approximation that predicts the phase offset between the spiral potential and density, the resulting radially increasing pitch of the potential, and the nonlocal outward angular-momentum transport by gravitational torques. Beyond the inner and outer edge of a spiral with $m$ arms, its potential is not winding ($\\alpha=90^\\circ$), decays like $R^m$ and $R^{-1-m}$, respectively, and cannot be predicted by a local approximation.",

Palumbo, Alexey Potapov, Maisie Rashman, Sascha Zeegers 28 pages, 7 figures, accepted by ApJ; two references replaced in latest version Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Infrared spectra of hydrocarbon dust absorption bands toward the bright hypergiant Cygnus OB2-12 are compared to published spectra of the Quintuplet Cluster, a sightline to the Galactic center. The Cyg OB2-12 data include a new ground-based 2.86-3.70 microns spectrum and a previously published, but here further analyzed, spectrum of the 5.50-7.34 microns region. Higher spectral resolution data for the Cyg OB2-12 sightline in the 3 micron region allows a detailed comparison of the 3.4 micron aliphatic bands to those observed toward the Quintuplet. Despite differences in interstellar environments along each sightline, strong similarities are observed in the central wavelengths and relative strengths for bands at 3.3, 3.4, 5.85, 6.2, and 6.85 microns. Analysis of these bands, produced by aromatic, aliphatic, olefinic, hydrogenated, and oxygenated components, shows that carbonaceous dust is a significant component of the diffuse interstellar medium, second in abundance only to silicates, and is primarily aromatic in nature. The grains producing these bands likely consist of large aromatic carbon cores with thin aliphatic mantles composed of hydrogenated amorphous carbon (HAC). Laboratory analog spectra reproduce the observed aliphatic absorption bands well, supporting the presence of such mantles. We present evidence that the carriers of both the 3.4 micron aliphatic and the 3.3 micron aromatic bands reside exclusively in the diffuse ISM, and that the 3.3 micron bands observed in the diffuse ISM differ from those seen in dense clouds, implying chemically distinct carriers.",

To assess the viability of directly observing flare impacts in the atmosphere of a brown dwarf, we perform self-consistent temperature-chemistry modeling of the atmospheric response to individual energetic superflares. We modified the existing open-source \\texttt{VULCAN} chemical-kinetics and \\texttt{HELIOS} radiative-transfer codes for this purpose. Similar to previous studies of flare impacts on hydrogen dominated atmospheres, we find flares are capable of orders-of-magnitude changes in the mixing abundances of many chemical species, including important opacity sources like CH$_4$ and CO$_2$. However, due to fast chemical timescales resulting from high temperatures and densities in brown dwarf atmospheres, these changes last for a short-period of time, generally less than a day, and are only plausibly observable via high resolution emission spectroscopy. We find that the most observable, short-term spectral changes in hot (T$_{\\text{eff}}\\sim2000\\,$K), high-gravity ($\\log{\\text{g}}\\sim5$), cloudless brown dwarfs are the photolysis of H$_2$O and enhancement of CO$_2$, which can result in part-per-thousands spectral changes in the hours after a flare.",

Finley Accepted to A&A. 9 Pages + Appendix. 8 Figures + 5 Appendix Figures Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) The Alfvén surface -- where the solar wind exceeds the local Alfvén speed as it expands into interplanetary space -- is now routinely probed by NASA's Parker Solar Probe (PSP) in the near-Sun environment. The size of the Alfvén surface governs how efficiently the solar wind braking torque causes the Sun to spin-down. We aimed to characterise the size and evolution of the Alfvén surface as magnetic activity increased during solar cycle 25. The Alfvén surface was extrapolated from the solar wind mass and magnetic flux measured by the SWEAP and FIELDS instrument suites onboard PSP. We accounted for the acceleration of the solar wind along Parker spiral magnetic field lines and used potential field source surface modelling to determine the sources of the solar wind. The longitudinally averaged Alfvén radius measured by PSP grew from 11 to 16 solar radii as solar activity increased. Accordingly, the solar wind angular momentum-loss rate grew from $\\sim$1.4$\\times 10^{30}$ erg to 3$\\times 10^{30}$ erg. Both the radial and longitudinal scans of the solar wind contained fluctuations of 10-40\\% from the average Alfvén radius in each encounter. Structure in the solar corona influenced the morphology of the Alfvén surface, which was smallest around the heliospheric current sheet and pseudostreamers. The Alfvén surface was highly structured and time-varying however, at large-scales, organised by the coronal magnetic field. The evolution of the solar corona over the solar cycle systematically shifted the magnetic connectivity of PSP and influenced our perception of the Alfvén surface. The Alfvén surface was 30\\% larger than both thermally-driven and Alfvén wave-driven wind simulations with the same mass-loss rate and open magnetic flux, but had a similar dependence on the wind magnetisation parameter.",

However, specifically for hard X-ray imaging, CLEAN suffers two significant drawbacks: a rather limited degree of automation, and a tendency to under-resolution. This paper introduces a multi-scale version of CLEAN specifically tailored to the reconstruction of images from measurements observed by the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on-board Solar Orbiter. Using synthetic STIX data, this study shows that multi-scale CLEAN may represent a reliable solution to the two previously mentioned CLEAN limitations.

These include stellar mergers and interactions induced in binary systems, and the role of angular momentum transfer between a star and its circumstellar disk in its early evolution. Each theory predicts unique rotation distributions in various locations of the colour-magnitude diagram. Specifically, the stellar merger hypothesis posits that the upper end of the main sequence will host a significant number of slowly rotating merger products, essentially that the blue straggler stars are an extension of the blue main sequence. In the present work, we use observations of three massive ($\\sim10^5$~\\msun) young ($100-300$~Myr) clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud using a combination of HST photometry and VLT/MUSE spectroscopy. We show that in all three clusters, these bright blue stars have stellar rotational distributions that differ significantly from that measured on the blue main sequence. We conclude that stellar mergers do not play a significant role in the formation of the split main sequence/bi-modal rotational distribution. As a corollary, we show that blue straggler stars in these YMCs display a wide range of rotational velocities.",

With a V-band absolute magnitude light curve peaking at $M_{max}(V) = -16.04 \\pm 0.25$ mag, this object is regarded as the second determined well-observed Iax supernova in the intermediate luminosity range after SN 2019muj. Our research aims to explore the question of whether the physical properties vary continuously across the entire luminosity range. We also investigate the chemical abundance profiles and the characteristic physical quantities of the ejecta, followed by tests of the predictions of hydro simulations. The pseudo-bolometric light curve was calculated using optical and UV (Swift UVOT ) light curves and fits with a radiation diffusion Arnett model to constrain the average optical opacity, ejected mass, and initial nickel mass produced in the explosion. We analyzed the color evolution of SN 2022xlp and compared it with that of other Iax supernovae with different peak luminosities. We used the spectral tomography method to determine the radial profiles of physical properties and abundances of the ejecta, comparing them with a set of hydrodynamic pure deflagration models. The estimated bolometric flux peaks at $8.87\\times 10^{41}$ erg/s and indicates the production of radioactive nickel as $M(^{56}$Ni) = $0.0215 \\pm 0.009\\,M_{\\odot}$. According to the best-fit model, the explosion energy is $(2.066 \\pm 0.236) \\times 10^{49}$ erg and the ejecta mass is $0.142 \\pm 0.015\\,M_{\\odot}$. The performed spectral tomography analysis shows that the determined physical quantities agree well with the predictions of the deflagration simulations, with modifications regarding the increased Na abundance and the more massive outer layers. SN 2022xlp bridges the previously existing luminosity gap, and supports the assumption of continuous variation in the physical properties across the SN Iax subclass.",

Saleem Khan, David Berghmans Accepted for publication in ApJL Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves play a key role in heating the solar corona and driving the solar wind. Recent observations have shown the presence of slow magneto-acoustic and Alfvénic waves in polar plumes and inter-plumes. However, a complete understanding of wave dynamics in the polar regions has long been limited by the lack of simultaneous, high-resolution observations. In this study, we utilize high spatial (210 km per pixel) and high cadence (5s) dataset from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) aboard Solar Orbiter, acquired on 14 September 2021. Our findings reveal the simultaneous presence of slow magneto-acoustic and Alfvénic waves within the same polar plumes. For slow magneto-acoustic waves, the amplitudes of propagating disturbances are 1.4 to 3.2$\\%$ of background intensity, with periodicities of 9 min, and the projected speed of these disturbances ranges between 115 to 125 kms$^{-1}$. The corresponding electron temperature in plumes ranges between 0.58 and 0.69 MK. The damping length of these propagating disturbances for five plumes is $\\approx$2.4 to 7.1 Mm. The propagating disturbances are also detected in the fine-scale substructures within the plumes. Alfvénic waves, on the other hand, are detected with average displacement amplitude, periodicity, and velocity amplitudes of 165$\\pm$82 km, 93$\\pm$39 s, and 12$\\pm$7 kms$^{-1}$ respectively. The ranges for displacement amplitude, period, and velocity amplitude are 50-600 km, 50-250 s, and 3-32 kms$^{-1}$ respectively. These results mark the first demonstration of Solar Orbiter/EUI's ability to simultaneously detect both slow magneto-acoustic and Alfvénic wave modes extending up to 20 Mm in polar plumes.",

In the past two versions of this equation were investigated. The more commonly used standard form described a pitch-angle isotropization process but does not conserve the norm. In the current paper we consider the focused transport equation in conservative form also called modified focused transport equation. This equation conserves the norm but does not describe pitch-angle isotropization. We use the previously developed subspace method to solve the focused transport equation analytically and numerically. For a pure analytical treatment we employ the two-dimensional subspace approximation. Furthermore, we consider a higher dimensionality for which one needs to evaluate occurring matrix exponentials numerically.

The TPA grew along the dawnside auroral oval from the nightside to the dayside, and an auroral spiral and several spots were located azimuthally near the poleward edge of the nightside auroral oval. Both auroras had tailward elongated source regions with scales of ~30 RE (spiral) and more than ~45 RE (TPA). To examine their magnetospheric and ionospheric field-aligned current (FAC) profiles, we performed global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, using two different types of code: Block-Adaptive-Tree Solar-wind Roe Upwind Scheme (BATS-R-US) and improved REProduce Plasma Universe (REPPU). Both MHD simulations reproduced the tailward elongated TPA-associated FAC structures. The spiral-associated FAC intensity was, however, approximately three orders of magnitude weaker than the TPA-associated FAC intensity. Only improved REPPU simulation replicated faint but continuous poleward extending streak-like structures without evident FACs, instead of the auroral spiral. Geomagnetic field measurements showed that the spiral had upward (from the ionosphere to the magnetosphere) FACs, and its appearance might be accompanied by ultra-low-frequency Pc5 waves. Our results suggest that 1) a local-scale spiral might be formed with much weaker magnetotail FACs than global-scale TPA-associated FACs, although the spiral source region is elongated tailward, and 2) a solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling system with minimal or no significant substorm effects is required to form the spiral with the weak magnetotail FACs.",

SHARP, a near-infrared (0.95-2.45 {\\mu}m) spectrograph, is designed to optimally exploit the collecting area and angular resolution of these forthcoming ELTs, and specifically optimized for the MCAO unit MORFEO at the ELT. SHARP includes two main units: NEXUS, a Multi-Object Spectrograph (MOS), and VESPER, a multi-Integral Field Unit. This paper outlines the opto-mechanical design of SHARP based on the scientific requirements of the project. The optical design is engineered to meet project specifications, featuring a compact mechanical structure that minimizes the required cryogenic power while ensuring ease of access for maintenance and straightforward assembly procedures.",

We performed on-sky testing to investigate three effects which may be limiting the performance of NIRC2 when conducting high-contrast imaging observations from $3-5\\mu$m. First, we report the measurements of an on-sky test of the throughput of the L/M vector vortex coronagraph. We quantify the throughput and additional background flux penalties, noting that the performance effects of using the vector vortex coronagraph in the Ms-filter are greater than in the Lp-filter. Second, we utilize the recently commissioned NIRC2 electronics upgrade to measure the sky variability at sub-second speeds. We find that the background varies at timescales of less than 30s, indicating that the electronics upgrade may open an opportunity to improve the sky-background subtraction of future surveys. Third, we document the contribution of the image derotator to the spatial non-uniformity in the background flux. We conclude by giving a set of recommendations of how the Keck-NIRC2 high-contrast imaging community can adapt their observing strategies to improve the sensitivity of future surveys.",

Fletcher, Matthew Hedman Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) When directly imaging a cold giant exoplanet hosting a ring system, the reflected light from the rings can outshine the planet's thermal emission and reflected-light in the near-infrared. Consequently, an exoring may be detectable at a significantly lower contrasts than is required to image the exoplanet itself. Here we investigate the detectability of exorings in near-infrared reflected light using NIRCam coronagraphy PanCAKE simulations of two nearby mature stars, Proxima Centauri and Tau Ceti. Under the most favorable assumptions, we find JWST 2$\\mu$m NIRCam coronagraphy (F200W + MASK335R) is capable of detecting an exoring system with a radius of 2.8 times that of Saturn's A-ring for planets on an orbit with a = 1.3-1.9 AU. Broader simulations indicate that NIRCam can probe large planetary ring systems around mature exoplanets comparable in size to circumplanetary disks, which can reach up to 1000 times the radius of Saturn's A-ring. These results suggest that NIRCam F200W coronagraphy could serendipitously detect large exorings in reflected light under the right conditions. A combined analysis of F200W coronagraphic observations of confirmed exoplanets could provide the first empirical constraints on the occurrence rate of large exorings. Confirming the existence and frequency of exorings spanning the scale between circumplanetary disks and the rings of the Solar System giant planet could offer new insight into the formation, evolution, and architecture of planetary systems.",

These synthetic planetary systems can however provide access to correlations, as predicted in a given numerical framework, between the properties of planets in the same system. Such correlations can, in return, be used in order to guide and prioritize observational campaigns aiming at discovering some types of planets, as Earth-like planets. Our goal is to develop a generative model which is capable of capturing correlations and statistical relationships between planets in the same system. Such a model, trained on the Bern model, offers the possibility to generate large number of synthetic planetary systems with little computational cost, that can be used, for example, to guide observational campaigns. Our generative model is based on the transformer architecture which is well-known to efficiently capture correlations in sequences and is at the basis of all modern Large Language Models. To assess the validity of the generative model, we perform visual and statistical comparisons, as well as a machine learning driven tests. Finally, as a use case example, we consider the TOI-469 system, in which we aim at predicting the possible properties of planets c and d, based on the properties of planet b (the first that has been detected). We show using different comparison methods that the properties of systems generated by our model are very similar to the ones of the systems computed directly by the Bern model. We also show in the case of the TOI-469 system, that using the generative model allows to predict the properties of planets not yet observed, based on the properties of the already observed planet.

In this study, we simulate the ability of space-based coronagraphy missions to uncover trends in planetary albedo as a function of instellation, and potentially constrain the boundaries of the habitable zone. We adapt the Bioverse statistical comparative planetology framework to simulate the scientific output of possible designs for HWO. With this tool, we generate a synthetic planetary population with injected population-level trends in albedo and simulate the observability of planets. We then determine the statistical power to which these trends can be recovered as a function of the strength of the injected trend and the sample size of Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone (exoEarths). The strongest trends in albedo require a sample size of roughly 25-30 exoEarths to recover with high confidence. However, for weaker albedo trends, the required number of planets increases rapidly. If a mission is designed to meet the Decadal Survey's requirement of 25 exoEarths, it would be able to recover very strong trends in albedo associated with the habitable zone, but would struggle to confidently detect weaker trends. We explore multiple strategies to increase one's ability to recover weak trends, such as reducing the uncertainties in observables, incorporating additional observables such as planet colors, and obtaining direct constraints on planetary albedo from full spectral retrievals.",

Unfortunately, such planets are at the detection limit. Estimating their statistical significance via false alarm probability (FAP) is crucial for their validation, and has a large impact on the estimate of their occurrence rate, which is of central importance for future spectroscopic missions searching for life signatures. Current methods estimate FAP by light curve inverting or scrambling, but we show that both of these approaches are unsatisfactory. Here we propose to modify the planet transit template by randomly shifting the transit times by small amounts. We show that the exoplanet search with the resulting Null Signal Template (NST) has the same statistical properties as with the true periodic template, which enables assigning a reliable star-specific FAP to every candidate. We show on simulations and on the real data that the method is robust to unmodeled noise contamination. We reevaluate the statistical significance of all 47 previously proposed habitable Earth-like and super Earth Kepler candidates and assign them star-specific NST based FAP. We identify 29 candidates with FAP below 1%, 7 of whom are currently not considered confirmed. Among these are Kepler 452b with radius $1.5 R{\\oplus}$, a period of 384 days, and KOI 2194.03 with radius $1.8 R{\\oplus}$ and a period of 445 days, both around Sun-like G stars. Several well-known candidates should be considered marginal or likely false alarms, including Kepler 186f with 20% FAP.",

To date, transmission spectroscopy has been the primary method used, but upcoming instruments will lay the foundation for advancing reflected-light spectroscopy. The main challenge in this area of research is the high contrast ratio between the planet and its star. RISTRETTO, a high-resolution integral-field spectrograph designed for ESO's VLT, aims to address these limitations through a combination of extreme AO, coronagraphy, and high-resolution spectroscopy. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the detectability of the temperate rocky planet Proxima b with RISTRETTO, using realistic end-to-end simulations and a specifically developed data analysis methodology. We created high-resolution star and planet spectra, selecting realistic observational epochs and incorporating the predicted performance of the AO and coronagraphic systems. We implemented noise and spectrograph effects through the Pyechelle spectrograph simulator. We then applied a new methodology to isolate the signal of the planet from the stellar one and proceeded to fit several planetary models in order of increasing complexity. We also introduced a method to determine the sky orientation of the stellar spin axis, which constrains the orientation of the planetary orbit for aligned systems. Assuming an Earth-like atmosphere, our results show that RISTRETTO can detect Proxima b in reflected light in about 55 hours of observing time, offering the ability to characterize the planet orbital inclination, true mass, and broadband albedo. In addition, molecular absorption by O$_2$ and H$_2$O can be detected in about 85 hours of observations. These findings highlight the potential of RISTRETTO to significantly advance the field of exoplanetary science by enabling reflected-light spectroscopy of a sample of nearby exoplanets.",

Abstract abridged for arXiv Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The observed architecture and modeled evolution of close-in exoplanets provide crucial insights into their formation pathways and survival mechanisms. To investigate these fundamental questions, we employed JADE, a comprehensive numerical code that models the coupled evolution of atmospheres and dynamics over secular timescales, rooted in present-day observations. JADE integrates photoevaporation with migration driven by von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) cycles from an external perturber, allowing us to explore evolutionary scenarios where dynamical and atmospheric processes influence each other. Here, we specifically considered GJ 436 b, a warm Neptune with an eccentric orbit and polar spin-orbit angle that has survived within the \"hot Neptune desert\" despite ongoing atmospheric escape. Our extensive exploration included over 500 000 simulations in a framework that combines precomputed grids with Bayesian inference. This allowed us to constrain GJ 436 b's initial conditions and the properties of its putative companion within a ZLK hypothesis. Our results suggest that GJ 436 b formed at ~ 0.3 AU and, despite its current substantial atmospheric erosion, has experienced minimal cumulative mass loss throughout its history, thanks to a late inward migration triggered by a distant companion inducing ZLK oscillations. We find that initial mutual inclinations of 80° - 100° with this companion best reproduce the observed polar orbit. By combining our explored constraints with radial velocity detection limits, we identified the viable parameter space for the hypothetical GJ 436 c. We found that it strongly disfavors stellar and brown dwarf masses, which offers a useful guide for future observational searches. This work demonstrates how coupled modeling can shed light on the interplay shaping close-in exoplanets and explain the survival of volatile-rich worlds near the edges of the desert.",

      "abstract": "Evaluation of multi-parameter likelihoods through iteration of two-dimensional slices Joel S. Jayson The Astrophysical Journal, 989:14, 2025 Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) In this paper we introduce a method for resolving multi-parameter likelihoods by fixing all parameter values, but two. Evaluation of those two variables is followed by iteratively cycling through each of the parameters in turn until convergence. We test the technique on the temperature power spectrum of the lensed cosmic microwave background (CMB). That demonstration is particularly effective since one of the six parameters that define the power spectra, the power spectrum amplitude, $A_{s}$, nears linearity at small deviations, reducing computation to incrementation in one-dimension, rather than over a 2D grid. At each iterative step $A_{s}$ is paired with a different parameter. The iterative process yields parameter values in agreement with those derived by \\textit{Planck}, and results are obtained within a few hundred calls for spectra. We further compute parameter values as a function of maximum multipole, $\\ell_{\\text{max}}$, spanning a range from $\\ell_{\\text{max}}$=959 to 2500, and uncover bi-modal behavior at the lower end of that range. In the general case, in which neither variable is linear, we identify moderating factors, such as changing both parameters each iterative step, reducing the number of steps per iteration. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computation has been the dominant instrument for evaluating multi-parameter functions. For applications with a quasi-linear variable such as, $A_s$, the 2D iterative method is orders of magnitude more efficient than MCMC.",

Current radio arrays usually rely on external particle-detector triggers: while this lowers thresholds for vertical showers, it excludes very inclined events, where radio detection is uniquely powerful because the particle cascade is absorbed while the radio pulse remains measurable. In this work, I present a proof-of-principle study showing that deep-learning-based triggering can overcome these limitations, operating robustly under realistic high-interference conditions and within the strict latency constraints of large-scale observatories. Using measured noise traces combined with simulated cosmic-ray pulses, a fully convolutional network was trained and optimised for MHz-scale trigger-trial rates, and its performance was compared to a simple threshold-based trigger, which proved markedly less efficient at the same false-positive rate. The trained model was then quantised with HLS4ML and synthesised with Vitis HLS for multiple FPGA targets. The quantised implementation preserves the floating-point model performance (AUC_float = 0.997, AUC_quant = 0.996) while achieving microsecond-scale inference this http URL results show that modern FPGA-based AI inference can provide low-latency, radio-only triggering for next-generation cosmic-ray observatories, particularly in regions with strong and variable radio backgrounds. This capability unlocks access to weak and highly inclined air-shower signals--even in noisy environments--thereby broadening the energy range, extending sky coverage, and opening the path toward ultra-high-energy neutrino detection with ground-based radio arrays.",

As the disk evolves and disperses, the truncation radius is expected to move outward as the balance between magnetic and viscous forces shifts. Planets migrating inward can become trapped near the inner edge, but as the edge itself moves outward, the evolving disk torques can drive planets to migrate outward as well. We employ N-body simulations to assess the influence of magnetospheric cavity expansion on the dynamical evolution and orbital architectures of compact resonant chains of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. Our results show that rebound-driven expansion of the disk's inner edge plays a pivotal role in destabilizing resonant chains by spreading planetary systems outward, thereby triggering early dynamical instabilities and giant impacts. Despite this dynamical evolution, key observable properties of close-in planetary systems -- such as the distribution of orbital period ratio, the intra-system similarity in planet sizes (``radius uniformity''), and the bimodal distribution of planet radii known as the ``radius valley'' -- remain largely consistent with those of systems formed without the rebound effect, in which the inner edge of the disk remains fixed. Thus, the primary consequence of the rebound appears to be the early disruption of resonant chains, rather than any significant alteration to the statistical properties of the resulting super-Earth and mini-Neptune populations.",

However, our understanding of its global properties remains limited. Using nine years of data from NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission, we performed a quantitative statistical analysis to explore the spatial distribution of the magnetic fields, solar wind and planetary ions in the magnetosheath. We discovered significant asymmetries in the magnetic field, solar wind protons, and planetary ions between the quasi-perpendicular and quasi-parallel magnetosheaths. The asymmetries in the Martian magnetosheath exhibit both similarities and differences compared to those in the Earth's and Venus' magnetosheaths. These results indicate that the Martian magnetosheath is distinctly shaped by both shock geometry and planetary ions.",

We performed fully kinetic 2D simulations of a reconnection event observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission and compared the resulting ion and electron energy distributions with observations. The simulations capture the overall shape and evolution of non-thermal energy distributions for both species, but generally underestimate the very-high-energy tail of the electron spectrum. Variations in numerical parameters have negligible effects on the resulting spectra, while the initial upstream temperatures instead play a critical role in reproducing the observed distributions. This work presents a novel analysis of particle acceleration in fully kinetic modeling of reconnection directly informed by observed, realistic parameters; highlights the limitations of 2D simulations and underlines the need for more realistic simulations (e.g. employing 3D setups) to capture the observed particle energization more accurately.",

Zanazzi, Eugene Chiang, Yifan Zhou 19 pages, 12 figures, accepted to ApJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The radii and masses of many giant exoplanets imply their interiors each contain more than $\\sim$100 $M_\\oplus$ of solids. A large metal content may arise when a giant planet grows by colliding and merging with multiple $\\sim$10 $M_\\oplus$ solid cores. Here we show that a giant impact with a young gas giant excites long-lived seismic oscillations that can be detected photometrically. Mode lifetimes are close to the planet's Kelvin-Helmholtz time, a significant fraction of a young planet's age. Oscillation periods lie between tens of minutes to an hour, and variability amplitudes can exceed a percent for several million years. Beta Pictoris b is a young super-Jupiter known to be highly metal-enriched. If a Neptune-mass (17 $M_\\oplus$) body impacted $\\beta$ Pictoris b in the past $\\sim$9--18 Myr, the planet could still be ringing with a percent-level photometric variability measurable with JWST.",

Accepted for publication in A&A. The updated version extends the original calculations to an Earth-sized planet. Comments welcome! Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) M-type stars are prime targets for exoplanet searches within their habitable zones (HZs). These stars also exhibit significant magnetic flaring activity, particularly during their first billion years, which can potentially accelerate the evaporation of the hydrogen-helium envelopes of close-in planets. We employ the time-dependent photoionization hydrodynamics code ATES to investigate the impact of flares on atmospheric escape, focusing on an Earth-sized and a sub-Neptune-sized planet orbiting an early M-type star at distances of 0.01, 0.1, and 0.18-0.36 AU-the inner and outer edges of the HZ. Stellar flaring is modeled as a 1 Gyr-long high-activity phase followed by a 4 Gyr-long low-activity phase, each characterized by an appropriate flare frequency distribution. We find that flares have a modest impact-less than a factor of two-on the cumulative atmospheric mass loss, with the greatest absolute enhancement occurring when the planets are at their closest separation. However, the relative enhancement in mass loss between flaring and non-flaring cases is greater at larger orbital separations. This trend arises because, as stellar irradiation fluctuates between quiescent levels and peak flares, the proportion of time that a planet spends in the energy-limited versus recombination-limited mass loss regimes depends on its orbital separation. Additionally, we demonstrate the existence of a characteristic flare energy, intermediate between the minimum and maximum values, that maximizes the fractional contribution to flare-driven mass loss. Our results indicate that the flaring activity of M-dwarfs does not significantly affect the atmospheric retention of close-in planets, including those within the HZ. The potential occurrence of rare super-flares, which current observational campaigns may be biased against, does not alter our conclusions.",

      "abstract": "Measuring the Mean Plane of the Distant Kuiper Belt Amir Siraj, Christopher F. Chyba, Scott Tremaine 6 pages, 3 figures; published in MNRAS Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) In the absence of any unseen planetary-mass bodies in the outer solar system, the mean plane of the distant Kuiper belt should be the same as the plane orthogonal to the angular momentum vector of the solar system -- the invariable plane. Here, we measure the mean plane of the non-resonant Kuiper belt across semimajor axes 50 - 400 AU. We introduce a new method to measure the mean plane that we demonstrate to be independent of observational bias. In particular, our results are not biased by surveys that look only at limited areas on the celestial sphere. We find a warp relative to the invariable plane at semimajor axes of 80 - 400 AU (98% confidence) and 80 - 200 AU (96% confidence), but not at 50 - 80 AU or 200 - 400 AU. If it is not spurious, a possible explanation for this warp is an unseen planet in the outer solar system. With $n$-body simulations, we find that a planet with mass between that of Mercury and the Earth, semimajor axis in the range 100 - 200 AU, and inclination $\\gtrsim 10^{\\circ}$ to be the most likely cause of the warp; however, parameters outside of these ranges are still possible. Such a body is distinct in both mass and semimajor axis from the various versions of an unseen planet invoked to explain apsidal clustering in the outer solar system. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to confirm or deny the existence of the warp reported here, and might detect the planet that may produce it.",
