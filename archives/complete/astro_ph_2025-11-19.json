      "abstract": "Non-Parametric Reconstruction of the Hubble Parameter from the Fourth Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog and DESI Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations Grégoire Pierra, Alberto Colombo, Simone Mastrogiovanni Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The release of the fourth Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4.0) by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration includes more than 200 compact binary coalescence (CBC) candidates that can be used to probe the cosmic expansion. The population of merging binary black holes has been used so far to provide a constraint on the Hubble constant and dark matter fraction under the hypothesis of a flat-$\\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter Universe. In this work, we provide the first non-parametric constrain on the Hubble parameter from 137 dark sirens reported in GWTC-4.0. We employ the relation between detector and source frame masses for detected GW signals, to obtain a statistical redshift evaluation for the population of binary black holes (BBHs). We model the Hubble parameter as a non-parametric autoregressive process in terms of the scale factor, using splines. In addition, we introduce two novel features: the use of \\textit{anchor} points for $H(z)$ derived from an external probe - here, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) - and a constraining power coefficient that quantifies where the inference is most data-driven by GW detections. We highlight three key findings: (i) using GWs alone, the Hubble parameter determination is the most GW-data-driven around redshift $z = 0.44$, yielding to $H(0.44) = 92.3_{-36.6}^{+29.9}\\rm\\, km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$. Its value at $z = 0$, the Hubble constant, is therefore less constrained by the GW data. (ii) The Hubble parameter inferred from analyses assuming a flat-$\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model is strongly affected by the cosmological model assumption. (iii) Introducing an anchor point for $H(z)$ enhances the inferred constraints and provides a clear visualization of the redshift range where GWs contribute most to the constraining power.",

By explicitly deriving and numerically integrating the full second-order kernel of the Einstein equations, we obtain a scale-invariant scalar spectrum without invoking a fundamental scalar field. In this framework, the amplitude of the scalar fluctuations is directly linked to the scale of inflation. More precisely, we show that matching the observed level of scalar fluctuations, $\\Delta_{\\phi}^2(k_\\ast)\\approx 10^{-9}$ at Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) scales, fixes the inflationary energy scale $H_{\\rm inf}$ as a function of the number of observed e-folds $N_{\\rm obs}$. For $N_{\\rm obs}\\simeq 30 - 60$, we find $H_{\\rm inf} \\simeq 5\\times 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{GeV} - 2\\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, corresponding to a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \\simeq 0.01 - 5\\times 10^{-9}$. In particular, requiring consistency with instantaneous reheating, we predict a number of e-folds of order~$\\mathcal{O}(50)$ and an inflationary scale $H_{\\rm inf} \\simeq 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$. We also incorporate in our framework the quantum break-time of the dS state and show that it imposes an upper bound on the number of particle species. Specifically, using laboratory constraints on the number of species limits the duration of inflation to $N_{\\rm obs}\\lesssim 126$ e-folds. These results establish the IWI scenario as a predictive and falsifiable alternative to standard inflaton-driven models, linking the observed amplitude of primordial fluctuations directly to the quantum nature and finite lifetime of dS space.",

      "abstract": "Disk mass predictions for binary neutron star mergers: limitations of proposed symbolic regression models Francois Foucart High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Modeling disk formation and mass ejection in binary neutron star systems is an important component in the construction of models for the electromagnetic signals powered by these events. Most models rely on analytical formulae for the disk mass and dynamical ejecta that are fitted to the results of numerical simulations, yet these fits have large uncertainties that significantly limit our ability to extract information from merger observations. In a recent manuscript, Darc et al claim that disk mass formulae constructed using symbolic regression outperform existing formulae and robustly extend to regions of the parameter space outside of the fitting region. I show here that the improvement over the most directly comparable existing model comes mostly from the use of different error measures in optimizing the fitting parameters. For the limited training data used so far, that existing fitting formula has a performance similar to symbolic regression models when optimized over the same error measure. More importantly, I show that many of the formulae obtained through symbolic regression provide unphysical results when used over the whole range of parameters relevant to the modeling of binary neutron star mergers, making them dangerous to use within parameter estimation pipelines. I conclude that fitting formulae with more physics input (e.g. Lund et al 2025), albeit certainly imperfect, remain safer to use in data analysis than these symbolic regression results. Symbolic regression results used in conjunction with careful physics-based vetting may however outperform them in the future.",

However, such a phantom-crossing dark energy evolution further exacerbates the already severe Hubble tension in the $\\Lambda$CDM model. Moreover, there exists a $\\sim2\\sigma$ tension between the DESI DR2 BAO and CMB datasets. Therefore, it is essential to measure the Hubble constant and dark-energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameters using only late-universe observations. In this work, we investigate a novel late-universe data combination: gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens, BAO, and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). This combination provides a fully distance-ladder- and CMB-independent determination of the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS. Using 47 GW standard sirens from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog, the DESI DR2 BAO data, and DESY5 SNe Ia data, in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, we obtain $H_0=74.8^{+6.3}_{-8.9}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $\\Omega_{\\rm m}=0.320^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$, $w_0=-0.775^{+0.072}_{-0.074}$, and $w_a=-0.80\\pm0.47$, indicating a mild phantom-crossing behavior within the $1\\sigma$ credible interval with an $H_0$ value consistent with the distance ladder measurements. Our analysis demonstrates the power of GW standard sirens in breaking parameter degeneracies, and this novel data combination provides joint constraints on the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS parameters.",

      "abstract": "Clustering effects on the Dark Siren determination of $H_0$: A simulation study Marios Kalomenopoulos, Riccardo Barbieri, Sadegh Khochfar, Jonathan Gair, Robert J. McGibbon Submitted in MNRAS, comments welcome! Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Gravitational waves (GWs) offer an alternative way to measure the Hubble parameter. The optimal technique, the ``bright siren'' approach, requires the identification of an electromagnetic counterpart. However, a significant fraction of gravitational waves signals will not have counterparts. Such events can still constrain the Hubble parameter $H_0$ via statistical methods, exploiting galaxy information from the GWs sky localisation volume. In this work, we investigate the power of this method using high-resolution, cosmological simulations that include realistic clustering. We find that clustering leads to increased convergence of the $H_0$ posteriors, with clear recovery of the input value as early as $N_{\\rm gw}=40$ events, compared to uniform catalogues, where the posterior remains largely unconstrained, even with $N_{\\rm gw}=100$ events. In addition, we quantify the role of catalogue incompleteness. We show that catalogues with completeness levels as low as $f=25\\%$ can be competitive with fully complete catalogues, confirming the impact of clustering. Completeness levels of $f=50\\%$ perform statistically similar to complete catalogues with as few as $N_{\\rm gw}=40$ events. This indicates the need to focus on improving gravitational waves detection capabilities, rather than obtaining more complete galaxy catalogues. Finally, we investigate additional properties of the method by taking into consideration physical weights, different observational errors, potential biases from the $H_0$ priors, a variety of detectors' horizon distances, and different methods of catalogue completion and statistical analysis.",

González, Jailson Alcaniz Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Combined measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia), have recently challenged the $\\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\\Lambda$CDM) paradigm, indicating potential evidence for a dynamical dark energy component. These results are usually obtained in the context of the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameterizations, generally implying in phantom-crossing at intermediate redshifts. However, a general mapping between these parameterizations that yields approximately the same background observables clouds the inference of the true nature of dark energy in the context of these parametric methods. In this work, we propose a model-independent reconstruction of the dark energy density, which is more directly constrained than its EoS, based on the Gaussian Process (GP) regression method with the use of DESI DR2 BAO data and the Pantheon+, Union3 and DESY5 SN Ia samples. In addition, we perform a statistical comparison between the energy densities of $\\Lambda$, a non-phantom thawing quintessence-type dark energy, and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterization with the reconstructed function. We find that all models agree with the GP reconstruction at 95\\% C.L., with the largest discrepancy coming from $\\Lambda$CDM with DESY5 at low redshifts.

Such signatures, associated with specific primordial features, can be detected by upcoming gravitational wave observatories, such as the LISA and Einstein Telescope (ET). Our analysis explores scenarios in which cosmic strings form either before or during inflation. We examine how the number of e-folds experienced by cosmic strings during inflation correlates with the predictions of inflationary models observable in cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements. This correlation provides a testable link between inflationary physics and the associated gravitational wave signals in a complementary manner. Focusing on $\\alpha$-attractor models of inflation, with the Polynomial $\\alpha$-attractor serving as an illustrative example, we find constraints, for instance, on the spectral index $n_s$ to $0.962 \\lesssim n_s \\lesssim 0.972$ for polynomial exponent $n=1$, $0.956 \\lesssim n_s \\lesssim 0.968$ for $n=2$, $0.954 \\lesssim n_s \\lesssim 0.965$ for $n=3$, and $0.963 \\lesssim n_s \\lesssim 0.964$ for $n=4$, which along with the GW signals from LISA, are capable of detecting local cosmic strings that have experienced $\\sim 34 - 47$ e-folds of inflation consistent with current Planck data and are also testable in upcoming CMB experiments such as LiteBIRD and CMB-S4.",

For our analysis we have followed Mukhanov approach for inflationary equation-of-state employing Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. We find that the model is capable of mimicking latest Planck results by providing excellent fit to scalar spectral index and its running. Not only that, amount of primordial gravitational waves is also within the present observational bound, $r<0.032$. In addition to that, when the combination of ACT-DR6 and Planck joint with BICEP/Keck 2018 data is taken into account inflationary predictions from quasi-exponential model are in excellent agreement. The model also yields sublime fit to the result of joint analysis of ACT-DR6, Planck joint with BICEP/Keck 2018 and DESI-Y1 data. The futuristic CMB missions LiteBIRD, Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 are promising to detect primordial gravitational waves if $r\\geq0.003$. We have also forecasted inflationary predictions from quasi-exponential model of inflation assuming the sensitivities of LiteBIRD, Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 along with combination of LiteBIRD and CMB-S4. We found that in each case quasi-exponential inflation may render excellent fit provided $r\\geq10^{-2}$.

We map the outflows into the FLASH hydrodynamics code to model their expansion in axisymmetry, and study the effects of employing different $r$-process heating rates. Except for the highest heating rate prescription, we find no significant differences with respect to overall ejecta dynamics and morphology compared to the simulation without heating. Once homologous expansion is attained, typically after $\\sim$ 2s for these ejecta, we map the outflows to the Sedona radiative transfer code and compute the spectral evolution of the kilonova and broadband light curves in various Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) bands. The kilonova properties depend on the remnant lifetime, with peak luminosities and peak timescales increasing for longer-lived remnants that produce more massive ejecta. For all models, there is a strong dependence of both the bolometric and broadband light curves on the viewing angle. While the short-lived (12ms) remnant produces higher luminosities when viewed from angles closer to the pole, longer-lived remnants (240ms and 2.5s) are more luminous when viewed from angles closer to the equator. Our results highlight the importance of self-consistent, long-term modeling of merger ejecta, and taking viewing-angle dependence into account when interpreting observed kilonova light curves. We find that magnetized outflows from a HMNS -- if it survives long enough -- could explain blue kilonovae, such as the blue emission seen in AT2017gfo.",

These highly magnified images contain important information about both the mass distribution of the cluster and the properties of the background source, but modeling them requires significant computational effort. Our new source reconstruction methodology is designed to be accurate and efficient for high-resolution observations in which point spread function effects are not significant. The overall process deconvolves the observed image by the point spread function, de-lenses the image pixels, and uses interpolation or regression with smoothing to determine the model source. By working with de-lensed points, the method accounts for varying resolution across the source plane. We evaluate the speed and accuracy of different interpolation and regression methods using both mock data and real data for the giant arc in Abell 370. We find that utilizing K Nearest Neighbor Regression results in the best balance of noise smoothing and preservation of compact detail in the source.",

Two complementary estimators are employed: (i) a parametric approach fitting the power-law of the two-point angular correlation function, which yields the homogeneity scale $\\theta_H = 9.01_{-3.61}^{+8.43}\\;{\\rm deg}$; and (ii) a non-parametric fractal correlation dimension method, computing $\\mathcal{D}_2(\\theta)$ directly from the correlation function, which results in $\\theta_H = 6.28_{-4.43}^{+8.72}\\;{\\rm deg}$. From the mock catalogues generated with the GLASS algorithm, we find that the estimates from both methods are within $1 \\sigma$ of the median values obtained by applying both methodologies to the mocks. The transition scale to homogeneity, according to the $\\Lambda$CDM model, is defined for matter, i.e. $b = 1$. Measurements of this scale with observational data clearly depends on the cosmic tracer analysed, and a calibration is necessary. Our study with blue galaxies, with bias $b \\simeq 1$, provides a suitable estimate for comparison. Indeed, the results obtained in both approaches are compared with the value expected in the $\\Lambda$CDM model, obtaining a good concordance.",

Using Chandra ACIS-I/S X-ray data supplemented with HST WFC3 imaging, we measure four morphological parameters: the concentration parameter (c), asymmetry parameter (A), centroid shift (log(w)), and the X-ray-BCG centroid separation (D [kpc]). Our goals are to (A) provide a robust classification of the dynamical state of the clusters in this strong lensing selected sample to enable studies that test various problems in cluster astrophysics and observational cosmology; (B) identify correlations, biases, or disagreements between different measurement proxies and cluster properties; and (C) measure the relaxation fraction (the fraction of clusters classified as relaxed based on X-ray morphology) and compare it to relaxation fractions from cluster samples selected using other methods. We combine the four morphological parameters into a single metric, the combined parameter M, which effectively separates the cluster sample into four dynamical state categories: relaxed; moderately relaxed; moderately disturbed; and disturbed. We find no significant trend in a cluster's dynamical state with its size, and only a weak, statistically limited dependence on mass and redshift. Based on our classification system, we find that $43\\%^{+9}_{-9}$ of the clusters are relaxed, which is consistent with relaxation fractions measured for other cluster samples selected on mass-observables. This implies a strong lensing selected sample of clusters is on average dynamically similar to clusters selected via different methods.",

Applying topological data analysis to simulated spectra spanning a range of X-ray heating efficiencies and dark-matter free-streaming scales, we compute persistence diagrams and Betti-0 curves that describe the formation and merger hierarchy of absorption troughs. A small set of interpretable descriptors (trough-line density, lifetime variance, and lifetime skewness) respond in nearly orthogonal directions across the (f_X, m_WDM) parameter space, enabling a substantial reduction of the degeneracy between heating and dark-matter suppression. These topological signatures remain detectable under SKA1-Low-like thermal noise, demonstrating that topology provides a stable and non-Gaussian probe of small-scale physics during Cosmic Dawn.",

Nicole Sanchez Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Though the nature of dark matter remains elusive, two models have come to prominence with testable predictions: cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). While CDM remains the widely accepted model, SIDM was introduced to potentially help resolve the discrepancies between the predictions of the CDM model and observational data, in particular the predicted central density profiles. Previous work involving simulations of small numbers of Milky Way-mass galaxies shows that SIDM delays massive black hole mergers as compared to CDM when the host halo has a flattened central density profile. It is, however, unclear how well massive black hole observations are able to differentiate between CDM and SIDM. In this work, we use mock gravitational wave observations of massive black hole mergers from LISA, a space-based gravitational wave observatory set to launch in the 2030s, to test LISA's capability to indirectly probe dark matter physics. As a proof of concept, we show that LISA may be able to distinguish between CDM and SIDM with a short-range interaction and a constant cross section of 1 $\\rm{cm^2~ g^{-1}}$ at the $\\sim2\\sigma$ level or greater, provided at least $\\sim80$ massive black hole mergers are observed with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 10.

However, the presence of bright foregrounds over four orders of magnitude stronger than the HI signal makes its extraction highly challenging. While all methods perform well when assuming a Gaussian beam degraded to the worst resolution, most of them degrade significantly in the presence of a more realistic beam model. In this work, we investigate the performance of SDecGMCA. This method extends DecGMCA to spherical data, combining sparse component separation with beam deconvolution. Our goal is to evaluate this method in comparison with established foreground removal techniques, assessing its ability to recover the cosmological HI signal from single-dish intensity mapping observations under varying beam conditions. We use simulated HI signal and foregrounds, covering the frequency ranges relevant to MeerKAT and SKA-Mid. The foreground removal techniques tested fall into two main categories: model-fitting methods (polynomial and parametric) and blind source separation methods (PCA, ICA, GMCA, and SDecGMCA). Their effectiveness is evaluated based on the recovery of the HI angular and frequency power spectra under progressively more realistic beam conditions. While all methods perform adequately under a uniform degraded beam, SDecGMCA remains robust when frequency-dependent beam distortions are introduced. In the oscillating beam case, SDecGMCA suppresses the spurious spectral peak at $k_\\nu \\sim 0.3$ and achieves $\\lesssim 5\\%$ accuracy at intermediate angular scales ($10 < \\ell < 200$), outperforming other methods. Beam inversion, however, remains intrinsically unstable beyond $\\ell \\sim 200$, setting a practical limit on the method.",

The global neutral hydrogen fraction (x_HI) is a key observable for probing this era. This paper presents a novel, statistically robust method to extract the evolution of x_HI from the challenging noise-dominated data from the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Data Challenge 3b. Our approach is based on a key physical insight: the pixel value distribution in SKA intensity maps is a mixture of signals from ionized and neutral regions. We model this distribution as a superposition of two Gaussian components-one fixed at zero representing noise and ionized bubbles, and a second, offset Gaussian tracing the neutral hydrogen signal. We perform this decomposition on data grouped into three redshift bins. The double-Gaussian model provides an excellent fit to the pixel histogram data. The derived x_HI values show a clear decreasing trend across the three redshift bins, consistent with a progressing reionization process. And the results are consistent with the provided simulation data. This method offers a powerful, model-independent, and fully interpretable way for measuring x_HI from 21 cm data, demonstrating significant potential for application to future SKA observations.",

While traditional two-point statistics have been known to be suboptimal for this task, recently proposed k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) based summary statistics have demonstrated tighter constraining power. Building on the kNN statistics, we introduce a new field-level representation of discrete halo catalogues - NN distance maps. We employ this technique on the halo catalogues obtained from Quijote N-body simulation suites. By combining these maps with kNN-based summary statistics, we train a hybrid neural network to infer cosmological parameters, showing that the resulting constraints achieve state-of-the-art, if not the best, accuracy. In addition, our hybrid framework is 5-10 times more computationally efficient than some of the existing point-cloud-based ML methods.",

As the sample of time-delay lenses grows to statistical size, with $\\mathcal{O}$(1000) lensed AGN forecast to be observed by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), there is an emerging opportunity to use TDC as an independent probe of dark energy. To take advantage of this statistical sample, we implement a scalable hierarchical inference tool which computes the cosmological likelihood for hundreds of strong lenses simultaneously. With this new technique, we investigate the cosmological constraining power from a simulation of the full LSST sample. We start from individual lenses, and emulate the full joint hierarchical TDC analysis, including image-based modeling, time-delay measurement, velocity dispersion measurement, and external convergence prediction. We fully account for the mass-sheet and mass-anisotropy degeneracies. We assume a sample of 800 lenses, with varying levels of follow-up fidelity based on existing campaigns. With our baseline assumptions, within a flexible $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology, we simultaneously forecast a $\\sim$2.5% constraint on H0 and a dark energy figure of merit (DE FOM) of 6.7. We show that by expanding the sample from 50 lenses to include an additional 750 lenses with plausible LSST time-delay measurements, we improve the forecasted DE FOM by nearly a factor of 3, demonstrating the value of incorporating this portion of the sample. We also investigate different follow-up campaign strategies, and find significant improvements in the DE FOM with additional stellar kinematics measurements and higher-precision time-delay measurements. We also demonstrate how the redshift configuration of time-delay lenses impacts constraining power in $w_0w_a$CDM.",

Abazajian 8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table. Code available at this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) The discovery of massive, high redshift galaxies with JWST has been argued to challenge $\\Lambda$CDM: such systems would require extremely rare halos and baryon-to-stellar-mass conversion efficiencies unphysically approaching--or exceeding--100%. If confirmed at galaxy formation forbidden efficiencies, these galaxies could signal new physics beyond standard cosmological structure formation. We develop a galaxy model framework that ties the linear power spectrum to the inferred efficiencies of galaxy growth in order to test the structure formation models. In addition, we incorporate multiple sources of error, including (i) observational sample variance, (ii) asymmetric scatter induced by the steepness of the high-mass halo tail, and (iii) systematic uncertainties in stellar mass estimates. We find that the inferred efficiency of star formation is dominated by systematic uncertainties on the spectral energy distribution inferred stellar mass of the JWST detected galaxies. The systematic uncertainty augments the asymmetry in scatter that largely brings the inferred efficiencies to be in line with that expected from early galaxy formation models. Our framework can be used to test $\\Lambda$CDM as errors are reduced and further detections are made.",

Accepted for publication in JCAP Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Measurements of the redshift drift -- the real time variation of the redshift of distance sources -- are expected in the next couple of decades using next generation facilities such as the ANDES spectrograph at the ELT and the SKAO survey. The unprecedented precision of such observations will demand precise theoretical and numerical modeling of the effect in the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

Our results represent an initial step toward deriving the redshift drift fluctuation power spectra from $N$-body simulations and establishing a methodology for the statistical analysis of the redshift drift effect using data from future large-scale surveys. However, further work is required to refine the approach and achieve an accurate modeling of the redshift drift fluctuation power spectra.",

Hudson, Deaglan J. Bartlett, Hélène M. Courtois 25 pages, 16 figures. Accepted in MNRAS Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The peculiar velocity field of the local Universe provides direct insights into its matter distribution and the underlying theory of gravity, and is essential in cosmological analyses for modelling deviations from the Hubble flow. Numerous methods have been developed to reconstruct the density and velocity fields at $z \\lesssim 0.05$, typically constrained by redshift-space galaxy positions or by direct distance tracers such as the Tully-Fisher relation, the fundamental plane, or Type Ia supernovae. We introduce a validation framework to evaluate the accuracy of these reconstructions against catalogues of direct distance tracers. Our framework assesses the goodness-of-fit of each reconstruction using Bayesian evidence, residual redshift discrepancies, velocity scaling, and the need for external bulk flows. Applying this framework to a suite of reconstructions -- including those derived from the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) algorithm and from linear theory -- we find that the non-linear BORG reconstruction consistently outperforms others. We highlight the utility of such a comparative approach for supernova or gravitational wave cosmological studies, where selecting an optimal peculiar velocity model is essential. Additionally, we present calibrated bulk flow curves predicted by the reconstructions and perform a density--velocity cross-correlation using a linear theory reconstruction to constrain the growth factor, yielding $S_8 = 0.793 \\pm 0.035$. The result is in good agreement with both weak lensing and Planck, but is in strong disagreement with some peculiar velocity studies.",

      "abstract": "A Bayesian estimator for peculiar velocity correction in cosmological inference from supernovae data Ujjwal Upadhyay, Tarun Deep Saini, Shiv K. Sethi Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The peculiar motion of the host galaxies introduces bias in estimating cosmological parameters from supernova data. The coherent component of the peculiar motion is usually corrected for using velocity field reconstruction based on the observed galaxy distribution, while the random component is treated statistically by inflating the magnitude uncertainty in the quadrature derived using the standard error propagation. The method of velocity field reconstruction requires assuming an underlying cosmology, which can introduce its own bias in the final inference. On the other hand, the statistical treatment of the random component assumes a locally linear approximation for the magnitude-redshift relation and a Gaussian distribution for the peculiar velocities, which can have extended tails in the non-linear regime. In this work, we present a Bayesian estimator for simultaneously correcting for peculiar motion while fitting a cosmological model to the supernova data, relaxing the assumption of linearity of the model and Gaussianity of the random peculiar motion. Our approach is based on considering the problem of fitting the magnitude-redshift relation as a non-linear model with errors in both dependent and independent variables. To this end, we develop a general method for fitting such non-linear errors-in-variables models. We then specialize it to the case of fitting the magnitude-redshift relation, validating it with simulated datasets at the precision of current and upcoming surveys, and testing it on the Pantheon sample. Our method provides an alternative approach for accounting for the peculiar velocity effects, which is a complementary method for the coherent component, as it does not require independent velocity measurements, and generalizes the treatment of the random component. Moreover, our general method is applicable to various other problems in cosmology and astronomy.",

B 871 (2025) 140011 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) It is widely known that the Saha equation is not suitable for describing plasmas out of thermodynamic equilibrium. The primordial hydrogen recombination plasma is an example of this. In this work, we propose a theoretical modification to the standard Saha curve motivated by Tsallis statistics. In particular, we explore the possibility that a time-dependent $q$-parameter may serve as an effective proxy for the evolving thermodynamic conditions during recombination, especially considering that hydrogen recombination occurs from excited states. Within this framework, the $q$-parameter could be interpreted as encoding departures from equilibrium and could play the role of effective time-dependent temperature. This indicates that the time evolution of the $q$-parameter could provide a phenomenological mechanism for incorporating non-equilibrium effects into the recombination history. Our findings suggest that the Tsallis parameterization provides an alternative path to fit the distribution of free electrons by using an effective temperature. The implications of this approach might go beyond its immediate applications, as the Saha equation is widely used in various scientific fields like astrophysics, cosmology, plasma physics, and condensed matter physics.",

EPJC accepted version Eur. Phys. J. C 85, 1308 (2025) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) In this paper, we employ two model-independent approaches, including redshift binning method and polynomial interpolation method, to reconstruct dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) $w(z)$ and DE density function $f(z)$. Our analysis incorporates data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data release 2, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors from Planck 2018 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope data release 6, and three Type Ia supernovae (SN) compilations (PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5). To ensure model independence, we adopt three redshift binning schemes (n=3, 4, 5) and three polynomial interpolation schemes with the same number of nodes (n=3, 4, 5). Our main conclusions are as follows: 1) After taking into account DESI data, there is a trend that DE should evolve with redshift (with deviations from the cosmological constant reaching at least a $2.13\\sigma$ confidence level), indicating that current observations favor a dynamical DE. 2) In the redshift range $0.5 < z < 1.5$, the DE EoS w(z) exhibits a decreasing trend and crosses the phantom divide $w=-1$, suggesting quintom-like behavior. 3) The DE density f(z) first increases at low redshift, reaching a hump around $z\\approx 0.5$, and then decreases at $0.5 < z < 1.5$, with a rapid decrease at $z>1.0$. 4) For $z > 1.5$, current data are insufficient to place strong constraints on the evolution of DE, resulting in large uncertainties in the DE reconstruction. It must be emphasized that, these four main conclusions are independent of specific reconstruction models, and are insensitive to the choice of SN compilations.",

Hayashi Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Dark energy(DE) remains one of the most important subjects in modern cosmology, and its physical origin is still under intensive discussion. While an astrophysical origin of DE is a highly challenging scenario, black holes stand out the most promising candidates as the astrophysical origin. In this paper, we explore a new model of DE induced by black holes, in which cosmic accelerated expansion caused by de-Sitter like space-time regions around the non-singular black holes. It is difficult to examine such a phenomena by measuring black hole mass because the energy density of the cosmological constant is much smaller than the mass density of a black hole near a black hole. On the other hand, this modification becomes dominant on the cosmological scale. Therefore, we focus on the cosmological probes and perform the MCMC analysis using Planck2018+DESI DR2+Supernovae. Since the total amount of DE density depends on the contributions of all black holes, we use the simulated results for the evolution of the number of black holes. As a result, we obtain the best-fitted total chi-squared value, $\\chi_\\mathrm{total}^2 = 2871.13$ compared to $\\Lambda \\mathrm{CDM}$ case $\\chi_\\mathrm{total, \\, \\Lambda CDM}^2 = 2819.00$, and $\\Delta \\chi^2 \\sim 50$.

Detailed release can be found at this https URL Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present constraints on models of cosmology and astrophysics using cosmic shear data vectors from three datasets: the northern and southern Galactic cap of the Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere (DECADE) project, and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3. These data vectors combined consist of 270 million galaxies spread across 13,000 ${\\rm deg}^2$ of the sky. We first extract constraints for $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology and find $S_8= 0.805^{+0.019}_{-0.019}$ and $\\Omega_{\\rm m} = 0.262^{+0.023}_{-0.036}$, which is consistent within $1.9 \\sigma$ of constraints from the Planck satellite. Extending our analysis to dynamical dark energy models shows that lensing provides some (but still minor) improvements to existing constraints from supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations. Finally, we study six different models for the impact of baryons on the matter power spectrum. We show the different models provide consistent constraints on baryon suppression, and associated cosmology, once the astrophysical priors are sufficiently wide. Current scale-cut approaches for mitigating baryon contamination result in a residual bias of $\\approx 0.3\\sigma$ in the $S_8, \\Omega_{\\rm m}$ posterior. Using all scales with dedicated baryon modeling leads to negligible improvement as the new information is used solely to self-calibrate the baryon model on small scales. Additional non-lensing datasets, and/or calibrations of the baryon model, will be required to access the full statistical power of the lensing measurements. The combined dataset in this work represents the largest lensing dataset to date (most galaxies, largest area) and provides an apt testing ground for analyses of upcoming datasets from Stage IV surveys. The DECADE shear catalogs, data vectors, and likelihoods are made publicly available.",

Accepted in MNRAS Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Claims of local ($z \\lesssim 0.05$) anisotropy in the Hubble constant have been made based on direct distance tracers such as Tully-Fisher galaxies and Type Ia supernovae. We revisit these using the CosmicFlows-4 Tully-Fisher W1 subsample, 2MTF and SFI++ Tully-Fisher catalogues, and the Pantheon+ supernova compilation (all restricted to $z < 0.05$), including a dipole in either the Tully-Fisher zero-point or the standardised supernova absolute magnitude. Our forward-modelling framework jointly calibrates the distance relation, marginalises over distances, and accounts for peculiar velocities using a linear-theory reconstruction. We compare the anisotropic and isotropic model using the Bayesian evidence. In the CosmicFlows-4 sample, we infer a zero-point dipole of amplitude $0.087 \\pm 0.019$ mag, or $4.1\\pm0.9$ per cent when expressed as a dipole in the Hubble parameter. This is consistent with previous estimates but at higher significance: model comparison yields odds of $877:1$ in favour of including the zero-point dipole. In Pantheon+ we infer zero-point dipole amplitude of $0.049 \\pm 0.013$ mag, or $2.3\\pm 0.6$ per cent when expressed as a dipole in the Hubble parameter. However, by allowing for a radially varying velocity dipole, we show that the anisotropic zero-point model captures local flow features (or possibly systematics) in the data rather than an actual linearly growing effective bulk flow caused by anisotropy in the zero-point or expansion rate. Crucially, inferring a more general bulk flow curve we find results fully consistent with expectations from the standard cosmological model.",

We present a comprehensive evaluation of all terms contributing to this cross-correlation, including both the transverse and longitudinal modes of the density-weighted velocity field, as well as all irreducible correlators that contribute to the momentum power spectrum. This includes the dominant component, involving the convolution of the electron-galaxy and velocity-velocity power spectra, an additional disconnected cross-term, and a connected non-Gaussian trispectrum term. Using this framework, we examine the impact of other commonly neglected contributions, such as the two-halo component of the dominant term, and the impact of satellite galaxies. Finally, we assess the sensitivity of upcoming CMB experiments to these effects and determine that they will be sensitive to the cross-term, the connected non-Gaussian trispectrum term, the two-halo contribution and impact of satellite galaxies, at a significance level of $\\sim 4-6 \\sigma$. On the other hand, the contribution from longitudinal modes is negligible in all cases. These results identify the astrophysical observables that must be accurately modelled to obtain unbiased constraints on cosmology and astrophysics from near-future kSZ measurements.",

Stiavelli Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a measurement of the free-streaming length of dark matter (DM) and subhalo abundance around 28 quadruple image strong lenses using observations from JWST MIRI presented in Paper III of this series. We improve on previous inferences on DM properties from lensed quasars by simultaneously reconstructing extended lensed arcs with image positions and relative magnifications (flux ratios). Our forward modeling framework generates full populations of subhalos, line-of-sight halos, and globular clusters, uses an accurate model for subhalo tidal evolution, and accounts for free-streaming effects on halo abundance and concentration. Modeling lensed arcs leads to more-precise model-predicted flux ratios, breaking covariance between subhalo abundance and the free-streaming scale parameterized by the half-mode mass $m_{\\rm{hm}}$. Assuming subhalo abundance predicted by the semi-analytic model {\\tt{galacticus}} ($N$-body simulations), we infer (Bayes factor of 10:1) $m_{\\rm{hm}} < 10^{7.4} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ ($m_{\\rm{hm}} < 10^{7.2} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$), a 0.4 dex (0.3 dex) improvement relative to omitting lensed arcs. These bounds correspond to lower limits on thermal relic DM particle masses of $7.4$ and $8.4$ keV, respectively. Conversely, assuming DM is cold, we infer a projected mass in subhalos ($10^6 < m/M_{\\odot}<10^{10.7}$) of $1.6_{-1.1}^{+2.4} \\times 10^7 \\ \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} \\ \\rm{kpc^{-2}}$ at $95 \\%$ confidence. This is consistent with {\\tt{galacticus}} predictions ($0.6 \\times 10^7 \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} \\ \\rm{kpc^{-2}}$), but in mild tension with recent $N$-body simulations ($0.3 \\times 10^7 \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} \\ \\rm{kpc^{-2}}$). Our results are among the strongest bounds on WDM, and the most precise measurement of subhalo abundance around strong lenses. Further improvements will follow from the large sample of lenses to be discovered by Euclid, Rubin, and Roman.",

However, analyses based on time-division CMB maps are fundamentally limited by the mapmaking cadence, restricting sensitivity to frequencies below $\\sim 10^{-5}$ Hz. In this paper we develop a phase-folding mapmaking framework to enable targeted searches of such periodic cosmological signals with frequencies up to the detector sampling rate of $O(100)$ Hz. We demonstrate the power of this framework with two cosmological applications: (1) constraining a stochastic gravitational wave background via its time-dependent lensing signature, and (2) the search for an oscillating polarization rotation from axion-like particles. We show that this technique transforms CMB experiments into broadband probes of the oscillating sky, extending their constraining power from the microhertz regime up to $O(100)$ Hz-an expansion of over seven orders of magnitude in frequency. This provides a new observational window, complementary to other approaches by probing under-explored frequency ranges for gravitational waves and axion-like particles.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) JWST provides a unique dataset to study reionization's earliest stages, promising insights into the first galaxies. Many JWST/NIRSpec prism spectra reveal smooth Lyman-alpha breaks in z>5 galaxies, implying damping wing scattering by neutral hydrogen. We investigate what current prism spectra imply about the intergalactic medium (IGM), and how best to use NIRSpec spectra to recover IGM properties. We use a sample of 99 z~5.5-13 galaxies with high S/N prism spectra in the public archive, including 12 at z>10. We analyse these spectra using damping wing sightlines from inhomogeneous reionizing IGM simulations, mapping between the distance of a source from neutral IGM and the mean IGM neutral fraction. We marginalise over absorption by local HI around galaxies, and Lyman-alpha emission. We observe a decline in the median and variance of flux around the Lyman-alpha break with increasing redshift, consistent with an increasingly neutral IGM, as ionized regions become smaller and rarer. At $z\\gtrsim9$ the spectra become consistent with an almost fully neutral IGM. We find S/N>15 per pixel is required to robustly estimate IGM properties from prism spectra. We fit a sub-sample of high S/N spectra and infer mean neutral fractions $\\overline{x}_\\mathrm{HI}=0.33^{+0.18}_{-0.27}, 0.64^{+0.17}_{-0.23}$ ($>0.70$ excluding GNz11) at $z \\approx 6.5, 9.3$. We also investigate local HI absorption, finding median column density $\\log_{10}N_\\mathrm{HI}\\approx10^{20.8}$ cm$^{-2}$, comparable to $z\\sim3$ Lyman-break galaxies, with no significant redshift evolution. We find galaxies showing the strongest absorption are more likely to be in close associations (<500 pkpc), implying enhanced absorption in massive dark matter halos. Future deep prism and grating spectroscopy of z>9 sources will provide tighter constraints on the earliest stages of reionization, key for understanding the onset of star formation.",

Exp Astron 60, 22 (2025) Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) presents a significant challenge for carrying out precision measurements in radio astronomy. In particular, RFI can be a showstopper when looking for faint cosmological signals such as the red-shifted 21-cm line from cosmic dawn (CD) and epoch of reionization (EoR). As wireless communications, satellite transmissions, and other RF technologies proliferate globally, understanding the RFI landscape has become essential for site selection and data integrity. We present findings from RFI surveys conducted at four distinct locations: three locations in India, the Gauribidanur Radio Observatory in Karnataka, Twin Lakes in Ladakh, Kalpong Dam in the Andaman Islands, and the Gruvebadet Atmosphere Laboratory in Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, Norway. These sites, selected based on their geographical diversity and varying levels of human activity, were studied to assess RFI presence in 30-300 MHz bands, critical for low-frequency observations and experiments targeting the 21-cm CD/EoR signal. Using an automated RFI detection approach via the Hampel filter and singular value decomposition, the surveys identified both persistent and transient interference, which varies with location and time. The results provide a comprehensive view of the RFI environment at each site, informing the feasibility of long-term cosmological observations and aiding in the mitigation of RFI in radio astronomical data. The methods developed to characterize RFI can be easily generalized to any location and experiment.",

Submitted to MNRAS High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present long-term three-dimensional (3D) simulations of Type-IIP supernovae (SNe) for 13 non-rotating, single-star, red-supergiant (RSG) progenitors with zero-age-main-sequence masses between 12.5 M$_{\\odot}$ and 27.3 M$_{\\odot}$. The explosions were modelled with a parametric treatment of neutrino heating to obtain defined energies, ${}^{56}$Ni yields, and neutron-star properties in agreement with previous results. Our 3D SN models were evolved from core bounce until 10 days to study how the large-scale mixing of chemical elements depends on the progenitor structure. Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities (RTIs), which grow at the (C+O)/He and He/H interfaces and interact with the reverse shock forming after the SN shock has passed the He/H interface, play a crucial role in the outward mixing of ${}^{56}$Ni into the hydrogen envelope. We find most extreme ${}^{56}$Ni mixing and the highest maximum ${}^{56}$Ni velocities in lower-mass (LM) explosions despite lower explosion energies, and the weakest ${}^{56}$Ni mixing in the 3D explosions of the most massive RSGs. The efficiency of radial ${}^{56}$Ni mixing anti-correlates linearly with the helium-core mass and correlates positively with the magnitude of a local maximum of $\\rho r^3$ in the helium shell. This maximum causes shock deceleration and therefore facilitates high growth factors of RTI at the (C+O)/He interface in the LM explosions. Therefore fast-moving ${}^{56}$Ni created by the asymmetric neutrino-heating mechanism is carried into the ubiquitous RT-unstable region near the He/H interface and ultimately far into the envelopes of the exploding RSGs. Our correlations may aid improving mixing prescriptions in 1D SN models and deducing progenitor structures from observed SN properties.",

The analysis of bright X-ray sources is complicated by so-called pile-up, which results from high incident photon flux. This nonlinear effect distorts the measured spectrum, resulting in biases in the inferred physical parameters, and can even lead to a complete signal loss in extreme cases. Piled-up data are commonly discarded due to resulting intractability of the likelihood. As a result, a large number of archival observations remain underexplored. We present a machine learning solution to this problem, using a simulation-based inference framework that allows us to estimate posterior distributions of physical source parameters from piled-up eROSITA data. We show that a normalizing flow produces better-constrained posterior densities than traditional mitigation techniques, as more data can be leveraged. We consider model- and calibration-dependent uncertainties and the applicability of such an algorithm to real data in the eROSITA archive.",

Using a modular back-tracing framework, we explore a set of widely used magnetic-field descriptions - from a Parker spiral baseline to more structured configurations that include latitudinal wind contrasts, Smith-Bieber-type azimuthal strengthening, and tilted or wavy heliospheric current sheets. Across these models the picture is consistent: most bending is accumulated within the inner tens of astronomical units and decreases rapidly with energy. Field choices and solar-cycle geometry set the overall normalization, with stronger spiral winding or a more highly tilted current sheet producing larger deflections at the same energy. Differences between electrons and positrons are most apparent at lower energies, where drift histories and current-sheet encounters diverge, and become increasingly small at multi-TeV energies. We summarize these trends with a practical threshold energy describing when heliospheric bending falls below an instrument's angular resolution, and we verify that our conclusions are robust to numerical settings. For current instruments, heliospheric effects can usually be treated as a small correction at the highest energies, while sub-TeV analyses benefit from a calibrated envelope that accounts for plausible field configurations during the observing epoch.",

Tinyanont High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Type Ibn supernovae (SNe) are characterized by narrow helium (He I) lines from photons produced by the unshocked circumstellar material (CSM). About 80 SNe Ibn have been discovered to date, and only a handful have extensive observational records. Thus, many open questions regarding the progenitor system and the origin of the CSM remain. Here we investigate potential correlations between the spectral features of the prominent He I $\\lambda$5876 line and the optical and X-ray light curve properties of SNe Ibn. We compile the largest sample of 61 SNe Ibn to date, of which 24 SNe have photometric and spectroscopic data from the Young Supernova Experiment and 37 SNe have archival data sets. We fit 24 SNe Ibn with sufficient photometric coverage ($B$ to $z$ bands) using semi-analytical models from MOSFiT. We demonstrate that the light curves of SNe Ibn are more diverse than previous analyses suggest, with absolute $r$-band peak magnitudes of $-19.4\\pm0.6$~mag and rise (from $-10$ days to peak) and decay-rates (from peak to +10 days) of $-0.08\\pm0.06$ and $0.08\\pm0.03$ mag/day, respectively. We find that the majority of SNe Ibn in the sub-sample are consistent with a low-energy explosion ($<10^{51}$ erg) of a star with a compact envelope surrounded by $\\sim$0.1 M$_{\\odot}$ of helium-rich CSM. The inferred ejecta masses are small ($\\sim 1$ M$_{\\odot}$) and expand with a velocity of $\\sim$5000 km/s. Our spectroscopic analysis shows that the mean velocity of the narrow component of the He I lines, associated to the CSM, peaks at $\\sim1100$ km/s. The mean CSM and ejecta masses inferred for a sub-sample of SNe Ibn indicate that their progenitors are not massive ($\\sim10$ M$_{\\odot}$), single stars at the moment of explosion, but are likely binary systems. This agrees with the detection of potential companion stars of SNe Ibn progenitors, and the inferred CSM properties from stellar evolution models.",

Broadband 3-79 keV spectroscopy employs a physically motivated model combining a cool truncated disk (\\texttt{diskbb}), relativistic reflection (\\texttt{relxill} in reflection-only mode), and Comptonized continuum (\\texttt{nthComp}) to probe the inner accretion geometry around a rapidly spinning black hole ($a_\\ast\\!=\\!0.98$) at moderate inclination. Simultaneous timing analysis reveals type-C quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) with novel coherence evolution: the quality factor ($Q$) exhibits a striking non-monotonic dependence on both QPO frequency and luminosity, peaking near $\\nu_{\\rm QPO}\\!\\sim\\!1.2$~Hz and declining at both lower and higher frequencies. This turnover directly constrains Lense-Thirring precession geometry, implying optimal coherence at intermediate truncation radius. A tight photon-index-QPO-frequency correlation demonstrates that spectral softening and frequency rise are concurrent signatures of inward truncation-radius motion. The triadic luminosity evolution-rising disk and Compton, declining reflection-traces precession-driven geometry changes and corona beaming effects. Interpreting disk-normalization variability as apparent-area changes rather than physical radius swings provides new insight into disk-corona boundary layers. These quantitative results provide strong evidence for global Lense-Thirring precession regulation of both timing and spectral properties, establishing Swift J1727.8$-$1613 as a benchmark source for understanding accretion-geometry physics during black hole state transitions.",

However, direct observational evidence of disk-jet co-precession remains elusive. Here, we report the most compelling case to date: a tidal disruption event (TDE) exhibiting unprecedented 19.6-day quasi-periodic variations in both X-rays and radio, with X-ray amplitudes exceeding an order of magnitude. The nearly synchronized X-ray and radio variations suggest a shared mechanism regulating the emission regions. We demonstrate that a disk-jet Lense-Thirring precession model successfully reproduces these variations while requiring a low-spin black hole. This study uncovers previously uncharted short-term radio variability in TDEs, highlights the transformative potential of high-cadence radio monitoring, and offers profound insights into disk-jet physics.",

Moreover, it is bright with little spectral turnover, and its profile perhaps uniquely remains undistorted by scattering far into the decametric band. Here we assemble more than a dozen of the highest quality profiles (30 MHz to 5 GHz) from half a dozen observatories, where possible polarimetric. The pulsar's 2.6$^{\\circ}$ core component marks the magnetic axis longitude, and we confirm that this point coincides both with the linear polarization angle inflection point and the zero-crossing of its antisymmetric circular signature -- thus providing the possibility to estimate emission heights over a very broad band using aberration/retardation (A/R). We then carefully fit the profile components with Gaussians to identify and study the subtle asymmetries produced by A/R. We find a consistent A/R in the pulsar's profiles of some 0.5$^{\\circ}$ longitude or 2 ms -- corresponding to a putative conal emission height of 200-400 km -- with a formal error of about 100 km. Our analysis finds no evidence whatsoever for an emission height increase with wavelength, the so-called ``radius-to-frequency mapping''. Nor do we find any significant difference in A/R effect between the outer and inner cones.",

P. Ho, Motoki Kino, Tomohisa Kawashima, Minchul Kam, Kunwoo Yi, Ilje Cho 28 pages, 21 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal Letters High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Relativistic jets from supermassive black holes are expected to be magnetically launched and guided, with magnetic energy systematically converted to bulk kinetic energy throughout an extended acceleration-collimation zone (ACZ). A key prediction of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models is a transition from poloidally dominated fields near the engine to toroidally dominated fields downstream, yet direct tests within the ACZ are hampered by weak polarization and strong Faraday rotation. We report quasi-simultaneous, high-sensitivity, multifrequency very long baseline interferometric polarimetry of M87 spanning 1.4-24.4GHz. We present high-fidelity, Faraday rotation-corrected maps of intrinsic linear polarization that continuously resolve the ACZ in the de-projected distance range of ~9e3 to ~3.6e5 gravitational radii from the black hole. The maps reveal pronounced north-south asymmetries in fractional linear polarization and electric vector position angle (EVPA), peaking in the inner ACZ at a projected distance of ~20mas along the jet and remaining prominent out to ~100mas. These signatures are best reproduced by models with a large-scale, ordered helical field that retains a substantial poloidal component-contrary to the rapid toroidal dominance expected under steady, ideal MHD. This tension implies ongoing magnetic dissipation that limits toroidal buildup over the ACZ. The handedness of the helix provides an independent constraint on the black hole's spin direction, supporting a spin vector oriented away from the observer, consistent with the orientation inferred from horizon-scale imaging. Farther downstream, the asymmetries diminish, and the EVPA and fractional polarization distributions become more symmetric; we tentatively interpret this as evolution toward a more poloidally dominated configuration, while noting current sensitivity and dynamic-range limits.",

Fast-time features of the neutrino luminosity and energy spectrum encode information about phenomena such as turbulence, convection, shock revival and potential quark-hadron phase transitions. In this study, we explore the detection capabilities of large-volume neutrino telescopes with a focus on IceCube and the planned extension IceCube-Gen2. Furthermore, we consider the effect on the detection sensitivity from wavelength shifters through enhanced light collection. A variety of models predict periodic fast-time features in supernova light curves; to quantify their detectability without relying on specific models, we investigate the detector response to a generic parameterisation of such features. We find that independent of feature frequency, IceCube-Gen2 instrumented with wavelength shifters has sensitivity to weaker modulations ($>25\\%$ amplitude) as compared to only the strongest modulations ($>50\\%$ amplitude) with IceCube. In addition, we examine the sensitivity of the neutrino lightcurve to sharp features from a quark-hadron phase transition. Phase transitions leading to a quark star remnant are detectable with IceCube at $5\\sigma$ up to the edge of the Galaxy, and throughout the Small Magellanic Cloud with IceCube-Gen2 equipped with wavelength-shifters. In contrast, models collapsing into a black hole are observable only within the Galaxy, covering $41\\%$ of the CCSNe population for IceCube and nearly all ($91\\%$) for IceCube-Gen2 complemented by wavelength shifters. These results highlight the potential of IceCube-Gen2 for detecting Galactic sources more reliably and with greater reach.",

Among candidate mechanisms, vortex creep heating (VCH) provides a robust link between spin-down and frictional dissipation in the pinned inner-crust superfluid, yet its interplay with fast DUrca cooling in massive stars remains insufficiently explored. We (i) implement VCH in our cooling code and validate it; (ii) identify the physically consistent domain where the steady-state form $L_{\\text{h}}=J|\\dot\\Omega_\\infty|$ applies; (iii) quantify how $(B,P_0)$ regulate observable VCH signatures under DUrca cooling; and (iv) introduce a 3D representation that resolves degeneracies hidden in standard 2D projections.

The method self-consistently couples the ejecta circumstellar medium (CSM) shock dynamics to radiative diffusion from a moving heating boundary tied to the shocks, so that both the photon escape path and the effective diffusion time evolve with radius and time. We solve the mass and momentum equations for the forward and reverse shocks together with the diffusion equation in the unshocked CSM. TransFit-CSM reproduces the canonical sequence of an early dark phase, a diffusion-mediated rise and peak, and a post-interaction cooling tail, and it clarifies why Arnett-like peak scalings break down in optically thick CSM. The framework is well suited for Bayesian inference and constrains physical parameters of the ejecta and CSM from bolometric or joint multi-band light curves. Applications to SN 2006gy and SN 2010jl yield accurate fits and physically interpretable posteriors, highlighting the dominant role of pre-supernova mass loss in shaping the observables. Because it is both computationally efficient and physically grounded, TransFit-CSM bridges simple analytic prescriptions and radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, enabling population-level inference for current and future time-domain surveys.",

The event was not detected in gamma-rays. Follow-up observations from $\\sim$1.5 to 100 days post-trigger were obtained across X-ray, UV, optical, near-infrared, and radio bands with ground- and space-based facilities. The redshift is constrained to $z = 0.7485$ from prominent optical spectral features. The optical light curve shows complex evolution: an initial $\\sim t^{-0.7}$ decay, followed by a rapid re-brightening peaking at day 7.7 with $\\sim t^{-1.7}$ decay, and a third phase peaking near day 19 with $\\sim t^{-1.3}$ decay. The spectral energy distribution (SED) and its temporal evolution are consistent with a mix of non-thermal and thermal components. Early optical-to-X-ray spectral indices agree with optically thin synchrotron emission, while steepening of the optical SED after $\\sim$20 days indicates either a shift in emission mechanism or the emergence of an additional component. Although broad-lined absorption features are absent, comparisons with type Ic-BL supernovae suggest a SN contribution at late times, suggesting a collapsar origin for EP 241021a. The likely SN in EP 241021a appears to require an additional energy source beyond $^{56}$Ni decay. These results support the view that some fast X-ray transients detected by the \\emph{Einstein Probe} arise from massive stellar explosions.",

In this study, we conducted 12-night multicolor optical monitoring using an 85 cm telescope from 2020 September to 2024 June and collected long-term broad-band archived data from radio to $\\gamma$-rays. Intraday variabilities were detected on four nights, and most of them exhibited a bluer-when-brighter behavior. Both clockwise and counterclockwise spectral hysteresis loops were found within a single night. However, no reliable intraband time lag was detected for the intranight variabilities. On long timescales, the cross-correlation analysis shows that the variations of the optical, X-ray, and $\\gamma$-ray bands do not reveal an obvious time delay, while the variations in the radio bands lagged them by about 370 days. The measured time lags suggest two distinct emission regions respectively responsible for the optical to $\\gamma$-ray radiation and for the radio radiation, with a spatial separation of approximately $4.50\\times10^{19}\\ \\rm cm$. We modeled the broad-band spectral energy distributions during four flaring epochs and one quiescent epoch, and found evidence for the possible persistent existence of a very high energy emission region. We also confirmed a spectral evolution of the source from an intermediate synchrotron peaked BL Lac object to a low synchrotron peaked BL Lac object.",

Bose High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Recent detections of very-high-energy (VHE; $\\gtrsim 100$~GeV) emission from GRB afterglows, notably the unprecedented brightness of GRB~221009A observed by LHAASO, reveal emission components beyond the standard electron synchrotron model. Multi-TeV photons motivate synchrotron self-Compton and possibly hadronic contributions, while the non-detection of coincident neutrinos by IceCube/KM3NeT/GRAND200k constrains the microphysical parameters, jet kinetic energy and ambient medium density. We model the VHE afterglow of GRB 221009A with an external forward shock from a Gaussian structured jet in a uniform density medium. This angular structure reproduces the extreme TeV output at an off-axis angle but without demanding large energies as in a top-hat jet. We also compute the corresponding $p\\gamma$ neutrino flux in the PeV-EeV energies and derive a time-integrated upper limit based on the effective areas of IceCube Gen2 and GRAND200k, providing the contributions of individual GRBs to the neutrino events. The predicted neutrino flux for GRB 221009A with model parameters inferred from multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution lies below the sensitivities of these detectors. Even under highly optimistic microphysical conditions, our correlation analysis infers that the events from this GRB are of order $\\sim 0.1$ for upcoming GRAND200k. We also compare neutrino fluxes for on-axis and off-axis viewing geometries and find that jet orientation alone can introduce nearly an order of magnitude variation in the signal. Thus, our studies imply that a GRB both brighter and closer than GRB 221009A would be crucial for any neutrino detections by upcoming neutrino telescopes. Future GRB detections by the CTA will provide important constraints on their geometry, radiation mechanisms, and any potential associated neutrino signals.",

Combi Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present the results of the first broadband X-ray analysis of the ultraluminous X-ray source NGC 5055 ULX X-1, combining simultaneous data from XMM$-$Newton and NuSTAR missions, with a combined exposure time of $\\sim$100 ks across the $0.3-20$ keV energy range. The source exhibits a stable flux across the entire exposure with no detectable pulsations by any instrument on their X-ray light curves, placing pulsed-fraction upper limits of 10% and 32% for XMM$-$Newton and NuSTAR, respectively. The X-ray spectrum is dominated by two thermal components consistent with the emission from an accretion disk, and shows a weak high-energy tail above 10 keV, with no statistical requirement for an additional nonthermal component. The unabsorbed $0.3-20$ keV luminosity is ${\\sim}2\\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, evidencing the ULX nature of the source. The parameters obtained from spectral modeling are consistent with the hard ultraluminous state. Despite the fact that a neutron-star accretor cannot be ruled out by the available data, under the assumption that the compact object in NGC 5055 ULX X-1 is a black hole accreting through a geometrically thick, radiation-pressure-supported disk that drives an optically thick wind, we constrained its putative mass to $11-26$ M$_{\\odot}$.",

We constructed a sophisticated three-dimensional radiative transfer model of the AGN source and dusty torus, built upon a physically motivated framework that includes a comprehensive dust grain model. To investigate the properties of the circumnuclear medium, we performed model fitting to a sample of 20 observational spectra from Spitzer Space Telescope's IRS Enhanced Data Products, testing two distinct dust density laws: a steep $r^{-2}$ profile, characteristic of a radiation pressure-driven wind, and a shallower $r^{-1}$ profile, which is a key prediction of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. Our model successfully reproduces fundamental observational phenomena, such as the transition from 9.7\\,$\\mu$m silicate emission at low inclinations to deep absorption at high inclinations, with absorption features becoming more pronounced for higher accretion rates, dust-to-gas ratios, and black hole masses. Most importantly, a direct comparison of the fitting results revealed that the $r^{-1}$ density law provided a significantly better fit ($\\chi^2$) than the $r^{-2}$ density law for 18 of the 20 observational spectra. These results confirm the physical consistency of our advanced radiative model and provide compelling evidence that an $r^{-1}$ density law is a more accurate representation of the AGN dusty torus.",

Accepted by Astronomy and Astrophysics Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the rapidly declining Type IIL supernova (SN) 2016iog. SN 2016iog reached its peak $\\sim$ 14 days after explosion, with an absolute magnitude in the $V$ band of $-18.64 \\pm 0.15$ mag, followed by a steep decline of $8.85 \\pm 0.15$~mag~(100\\,d)$^{-1}$ post-peak. Such a high decline rate makes SN~2016iog one of the fastest declining Type~IIL SNe observed to date. The rapid rise in the light curve, combined with the nearly featureless continuum observed in the spectrum at +9.3 days, suggests the presence of interaction. In the recombination phase, we observed broad H$\\alpha$ lines that persist at all epochs. In addition, the prominent double-peaked H$\\alpha$ feature observed in the late-time spectrum (+190.8 days) is likely attributable either to significant dust formation within a cool dense shell or to asymmetric circumstellar material. These features suggest the presence of sustained interaction around SN~2016iog. We propose that the observed characteristics of SN~2016iog can be qualitatively explained by assuming a low-mass H-rich envelope surrounding a red supergiant progenitor star with low-density circumstellar material.",

Hansen 21 pages, 16 figures, submitted to Astronomy&Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The astrophysical site(s) of the r-process are uncertain, with candidates such as neutron star mergers and magneto-rotational supernovae predicting different event rates, delay times, and heavy-element yields. Galactic chemical evolution models constrain these properties by comparing model predictions with observed abundances. We explore, in a systematic and data-driven way, the astrophysical conditions under which r-process enrichment can reproduce the observed trends of multiple neutron-capture elements in the Milky Way. Rather than assuming a fixed site, we adopt a flexible, parametric approach to test whether a common set of r-process parameters can explain the chemical evolution of several heavy elements. We compute a grid of one-infall, homogeneous models varying: Eu yield per event, r-process event rate, enrichment delay time, and progenitor mass range. For each of the $\\sim 1.5 \\times 10^5$ models, we predict [X/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] trends by scaling Eu yields with the solar r-process pattern. A multi-objective optimisation based on Pareto fronts identifies models that best reproduce the abundance trends. Best-fitting models favour short delay times ($\\leq 30\\ \\rm Myr$), low-mass progenitors ($\\sim 20-25\\ \\rm M_\\odot$), and an effective Eu injection of $\\sim 2 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\rm M_\\odot$ per event. Stars more massive than $\\sim 80\\ \\rm M_\\odot$ are too rare to dominate the enrichment. While heavy elements can be reproduced, lighter ones show stronger conflicts with Eu, reflecting that the solar r-process scaling relation becomes less valid toward lighter elements. No single class of r-process events, under solar-scaled yields, can explain light and heavy neutron-capture elements; at least two components are required: a main r-process consistent with solar and r-rich stars, and a weaker component producing enhanced light r-process elements, similar to that observed in r-poor stars.",

Webber High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Measuring spectroscopic redshifts for BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects, a class of blazar, is challenging because their optical spectrum lacks, or has weak, emission lines ( equivalent width $\\leqslant5Å$). In this situation, alternative techniques are necessary for the estimation of distances to these sources. In this paper, we estimate the redshift by the photometric dropout technique for a sample of 64 blazars (59 BL Lacs and five blazar candidates of uncertain type). Two telescopes are utilized to observe the sample. The Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) on board {\\it Swift} ({\\it Swift}/UVOT) observes sources in $uvw2,\\ uvm2,\\ uvw1,\\ u,\\ b,\\ v$ filters, while the ground-based telescopes SARA-CT/RM observed sources in $g',\\ r,' \\ i',\\ z'$ filters. We fit the photometric data with the LePHARE package and report four new high-$z$ ($z>1.3$) BL Lacs at $2.03^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$, $1.84^{+0.10}_{-0.03}$, $2.04^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$, and $2.93^{+0.01}_{-0.04}$ as well as upper limits for 50 sources. This work increased the number of high-$z$ BL Lacs found by this method up to 23. The high-$z$ sources are discussed in the context of the cosmic gamma-ray horizon, blazar sequence, Fermi blazar divide, and masquerading BL Lacs.",

Some stellar-mass BHs drive relativistic jets when accreting matter from their companion stars, forming microquasars. Non-thermal emission from the radio to tera-electronvolt (TeV) gamma-ray band has been observed from microquasars, indicating the acceleration of relativistic particles. Here we report detection of four microquasars (SS 433, V4641 Sgr, GRS 1915+105, MAXI J1820+070) of spectrum extending to the ultrahigh-energy (UHE; photon energy $E>100$ TeV) band and one microquasar (Cygnus X-1) of spectrum approaching 100 TeV, using the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Notably, the total emission associated with SS 433 cannot be interpreted with a single leptonic component. In the UHE band, its emission is in spatial coincidence with a giant atomic cloud, which is consistent with a hadronic origin. An elongated source is discovered from V4641 Sgr with the spectrum continuing up to 800 TeV. The detection of UHE gamma rays demonstrates that accreting BHs and their environments can operate as extremely efficient accelerators of particles out of 1 peta-electronvolt (PeV), suggesting microquasars to be important contributors to Galactic cosmic rays especially around the `knee' region.",

We need to understand the origin of these results which were not predicted by our early theories of the pulsar magnetosphere. In order to gain new intuition on this problem, we set out to obtain the theoretical steady-state solution of the 3D ideal force-free magnetosphere with zero dissipation along the separatrix and equatorial current sheets. In order to achieve our goal, we needed to develop a novel numerical method. We solve two independent magnetospheric problems without current sheet discontinuities in the domains of open and closed field lines, and adjust the shape of their interface (the separatrix) to satisfy pressure balance between the two regions. The solution is obtained with meshless Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). In this paper we present our first results for an inclined dipole rotator using the new methodology. We are able to zoom-in around the Y-point and inside the closed-line region, and we observe new interesting features. This is the first time the steady-state 3D problem is addressed directly, and not through a time-dependent simulation that eventually relaxes to a steady-state. We have trained a Neural Network that instantaneously yields the three components of the magnetic field and their spatial derivatives at any given point. Our results demonstrate the potential of the new method to generate new solutions of the ideal pulsar magnetosphere.",

However, the poor knowledge of nuclear reactions, in particular for the production of antimatter and secondary nuclei, limits the information that can be extracted from these data, such as source properties, transport in the Galaxy and indirect searches for particle dark matter. The Cross-Section for Cosmic Rays at CERN workshop series has addressed the challenges encountered in the interpretation of high-precision cosmic-ray data, with the goal of strengthening emergent synergies and taking advantage of the complementarity and know-how in different communities, from theoretical and experimental astroparticle physics to high-energy and nuclear physics. In this paper, we present the outcomes of the third edition of the workshop that took place in 2024. We present the current state of cosmic-ray experiments and their perspectives, and provide a detailed road map to close the most urgent gaps in cross-section data, in order to efficiently progress on many open physics cases, which are motivated in the paper. Finally, with the aim of being as exhaustive as possible, this report touches several other fields -- such as cosmogenic studies, space radiation protection and hadrontherapy -- where overlapping and specific new cross-section measurements, as well as nuclear code improvement and benchmarking efforts, are also needed. We also briefly highlight further synergies between astroparticle and high-energy physics on the question of cross-sections.",

Tkachev International Journal of Modern Physics A. 2025. P. 2540012 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The standard assumption about the influence of the turbulent intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) on the images of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) sources is that the latter are formed in a random walk mode in the deflection angle. As a result, the images are symmetrically broadened to angular scales proportional to the IGMF strength and the square root of its correlation length. We demonstrate that when the size of the emitting region is smaller than the correlation length of the IGMF, a new focusing regime emerges. In this regime, significant deviations from the standard random walk approximation occur even when the distance between the source and the observer exceeds several tens of IGMF correlation lengths. The angular size of the resulting images is typically smaller than predicted by random walk, and the IGMF causes a systematic shift of the entire image away from the true source direction. This introduces additional uncertainty in the search for UHECR sources. We show that the excess observed by Pierre Auger Observatory in the direction of Cen A can be explained by the contribution of M83, provided that the image shift occurs as predicted by some models of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) and that the IGMF plays a minor role due to its low strength and short coherence length. Alternatively, Cen A may indeed be the true source of the excess, as certain realizations of the IGMF can compensate the deflection caused by the GMF.",

McLaughlin Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Redback pulsars are a subclass of millisecond pulsar system with a low-mass non-degenerate companion star being ablated by the pulsar. They are of interest due to the insights they can provide for late-stage pulsar evolution during the recycling process. J0523.5-2529 is one such candidate where redback-like emission has been seen at multiple wavelengths except radio. It is a system with a binary orbit of 16.5 hours and a low-mass non-degenerate companion of approximately 0.8 solar masses. The aim of this work was to conduct follow-up radio observations to search for any exhibited radio pulsar emission from J0523.5-2529. This work employs a periodicity and single burst search across 74 percent of the system's orbital phase using a total of 34.5 hours of observations. Observations were carried out using the Murriyang Telescope at Parkes and the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT). Despite extensive orbital phase coverage, no periodic or single-pulse radio emission was detected above a signal-to-noise threshold of 7. A comprehensive search for radio pulsations from J0523.5-2529 using Parkes and GBT yielded no significant emission, likely due to intrinsic faintness, scattering, or eclipses by the companion's outflow. The results demonstrate the elusiveness of the pulsar component in some redback systems and highlight the need for multi-wavelength follow-up and higher-frequency radio observations to constrain the source nature and binary dynamics.",

Mukhamedzhanov High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The $^{12}\\mathrm{C}(\\alpha,\\gamma)^{16}\\mathrm{O}$ reaction governs the carbon-to-oxygen ratio set during helium burning, shaping white-dwarf structure and Type~Ia supernova yields. At the astrophysical energy $E \\approx 300~\\mathrm{keV}$, the cross section is controlled by the subthreshold $1^{-}$ (7.12~MeV) and $2^{+}$ (6.92~MeV) states, whose contributions depend on their asymptotic normalization coefficients (ANCs) $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$, respectively. We perform a Bayesian analysis of the $S_{E1}(300~\\mathrm{keV})$ and $S_{E2}(300~\\mathrm{keV})$ factors using calibrated $R$-matrix mappings and experimental ANC constraints for the $1^{-}$, $2^{+}$, and $0^{+}$ ground state.

For $S_{E2}(300~\\mathrm{keV})$, the analysis includes the interference of the radiative transition through the subthreshold resonance with the direct capture to the ground-state, which depends on the ground-state ANC $C_{0}$, giving broad posterior with $68\\%$ credible interval spanning $[30.7,\\,50.5]$~keV\\,b. The Gaussian priors centered near anchor values. The resulting posteriors quantify both correlations and uncertainties: despite incorporating the published ANC constraints, the $68\\%$ intervals remain broad, showing that present ANC determinations do not yet reduce the astrophysical uncertainty. Overall, the Bayesian framework provides statistically robust posteriors for $S_{E1}(300~\\mathrm{keV})$ and $S_{E2}(300~\\mathrm{keV})$, improving the reliability of extrapolations for stellar modeling and nucleosynthesis.",

The Einstein Probe (EP) mission provides a transformative opportunity to investigate their nature. While mounting observations of EP-discovered EFXTs (EP-EFXTs) suggest a possible connection to long gamma-ray bursts (lGRBs), an in-depth comparative analysis between them remains lacking. Here, we present a comparative analysis of their cosmic formation histories, revealing that EP-EFXTs and lGRBs share a similar evolutionary trend-showing a marked decline at $z<1.0$ and a plateau beyond $1.0<z<5$-which clearly distinguishes them from short GRBs. This result is derived from a rigorously selected sample of EP-EFXTs, using Lynden-Bell's $c^{-}$ method to reconstruct, for the first time, the luminosity function and formation rate of EP-EFXTs without any assumptions. Our findings provide independent evidence that EP-EFXTs and lGRBs may originate from a common progenitor channel.",

In this work, we investigate two FXRTs, the LEIA X-ray Transient LXT 240402A and the Einstein Probe EP250207b, whose precise positions lie close to nearby ($z\\!\\lesssim\\!0.1$) quiescent galaxies with negligible probability of chance coincidence, identifying them as particularly promising cases of merger-driven explosions in the local Universe. We used Chandra to derive accurate localizations for both events and secure otherwise ambiguous associations with their optical counterparts. Deep optical and near-infrared observations with VLT, GTC, and LBT were performed to characterize the surrounding environment and search for kilonova emission, the hallmark of neutron star mergers. Complementary early-time X-ray monitoring with Swift and Einstein Probe was used to constrain the non-thermal afterglow. We find that both FXRTs remain compatible with a compact binary merger progenitor, which produced low-mass ejecta and kilonova emission subdominant to the afterglow. However, alternative explanations such as a distant ($z\\!\\gtrsim\\!1$) core-collapse supernova cannot be conclusively ruled out.",

Ranea-Sandoval, Germán Lugones High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The equation of state of dense matter remains a central challenge in astrophysics and high-energy physics, particularly at supra-nuclear densities where exotic degrees of freedom like hyperons or deconfined quarks are expected to appear. Neutron stars provide a unique natural laboratory to probe this regime. In this work, we present EVA--01, a novel equation of state that provides a unified description of dense matter by incorporating both hadron and quark degrees of freedom within a single relativistic mean-field Lagrangian, from which the equation of state is derived at finite temperature. The model extends the density-dependent formalism by introducing a Polyakov-loop-inspired scalar field to dynamically govern the hadron-quark phase transition, following the approach of chiral mean-field models. The resulting model is consistent with a wide range of theoretical and observational constraints, including those from chiral effective field theory, massive pulsars, gravitational-wave events, and NICER data. We analyze its thermodynamic properties by constructing the QCD phase diagram, identifying the deconfinement, chiral, and nuclear liquid-gas transitions. As a first application, we model the evolution of proto-neutron stars using isentropic snapshots and explore the implications of the slow stable hybrid star hypothesis. Our findings establish EVA--01 as a robust and versatile framework for exploring dense matter, bridging the gap between microphysical models and multimessenger astrophysical observations.",

LPD is specifically designed to observe the polarization of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) prompt emission in the energy range of 2-10 keV, with a wide field of view (FoV) of 90 degrees in preliminary design. This observation is achieved using an array of X-ray photoelectric polarimeters based on gas pixel detectors. Due to the wide FoV configuration, the in-orbit background count rate in the soft X-ray range is high, while GRBs themselves also exhibit a high flux in this energy band. In order to assess the contribution of various background components to the total count rate, we conducted detailed simulations using the GEANT4 C++ package. Our simulations encompassed the main interactions within the instrument materials and provided insights into various background components within the wide FoV scheme. The simulation results reveal that among the background components, the primary contributors are the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) and bright X-ray sources. The total background count rate of LPD, after applying the charged particle background rejection algorithm, is approximately 0.55 counts/cm^2/s on average, and it varies with the detector's orbit and pointing direction. Furthermore, we performed comprehensive simulations and comparative analyses of the CXB and X-ray bright sources under different FoVs and detector pointings. These analyses provide valuable insights into the background characteristic for soft X-ray polarimeter with wide FoV.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The abundant population of \"Little Red Dots\" (LRDs)-compact objects with red UV to optical colors and broad Balmer lines at high redshift-is unveiling new insights into the properties of early active galactic nuclei (AGN). Perhaps the most surprising features of this population are the presence of Balmer absorption and ubiquitous strong Balmer breaks. Recent models link these features to an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) cocooned in very dense gas ($N_{\\rm H}\\sim10^{24}\\,\\rm cm^{-2}$). We present a stringent test of such models using VLT/MUSE observations of A2744-45924, the most luminous LRD known to date ($L_{\\rm H\\alpha}\\approx10^{44}~\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}$), located behind the Abell-2744 lensing cluster at $z=4.464$ ($\\mu=1.8$). We detect a moderately extended Ly$\\alpha$ nebula ($h\\approx5.7$ pkpc), spatially offset from the point-like H$\\alpha$ seen by JWST. The Ly$\\alpha$ emission is narrow ($\\rm FWHM=270\\pm 15~km\\,s^{-1}$), spatially offset to H$\\alpha$, and faint ($\\rm Ly\\alpha=0.07H\\alpha$) compared to Ly$\\alpha$ nebulae typically observed around quasars of similar luminosity. We detect compact N$\\,$IV]$\\lambda$1486 emission, spatially aligned with H$\\alpha$, and a spatial shift in the far-UV continuum matching the Ly$\\alpha$ offset. We discuss that H$\\alpha$ and Ly$\\alpha$ have distinct physical origins: H$\\alpha$ originates from the AGN, while Ly$\\alpha$ is powered by star formation. In the environment of A2744-45924, we identify four extended Ly$\\alpha$ halos ($\\Delta z<0.02$, $\\Delta r<100$ pkpc). Their Ly$\\alpha$ luminosities match expectations based on H$\\alpha$ emission, indicating no evidence for radiation from A2744-45924 affecting its surroundings. The lack of strong, compact, and broad Ly$\\alpha$ and the absence of a luminous extended halo, suggest that the UV AGN light is obscured by dense gas cloaking the SMBH with covering factor close to unity.",

Comments welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Dynamical friction governs the orbital decay of massive perturbers within galaxies and dark matter halos, yet its standard Chandrasekhar formulation fails in systems with cores of (roughly) constant density, where inspiral can halt or even reverse, phenomena known respectively as core stalling and dynamical buoyancy. Although these effects have been observed in simulations, the conditions under which they arise remain unclear. Using high-resolution N-body simulations and analytic insights from kinetic theory, we systematically explore the physical origin of these effects. We demonstrate that the overall distribution function (DF) of the host, not just its central density gradient, determines the efficiency and direction of dynamical friction. Core stalling arises when the perturber encounters a plateau in the DF, either pre-existing or dynamically created through its own inspiral, while buoyancy emerges in systems whose DFs possess an inflection that drives an unstable dipole mode. We show that double power-law density profiles with rapid outer-to-inner slope transitions naturally produce such DF features, which is why structurally similar cores can yield radically different dynamical outcomes. Our results provide a unified framework linking the phase-space structure of galaxies to the fate of embedded massive objects, with direct implications for off-center AGN, the dynamics of nuclear star clusters, and the stalled coalescence of black holes in dwarf galaxies and massive ellipticals.",

Accepted for publication on A&A. This is the second paper of a series. Paper I will be posted soon Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) With a sample of 552 galaxies at z~0.7 from the LEGA-C survey, we investigate how current star formation influences light-weighted mean stellar ages and metallicities, and their median trends with stellar mass or velocity dispersion. The bimodality in the global age-mass relation stems from the different age distributions in the quiescent (Q) and star-forming (SF) populations. A bimodality is not observed in the stellar metallicity-mass relation, although Q and SF galaxies have different distributions in this parameter space. We identify a high-metallicity sequence populated by both Q and weakly SF galaxies. At masses below logM/Msun=10.8 the median stellar metallicity-mass relation of SF galaxies steepens, as a consequence of increasing scatter toward lower stellar metallicities for galaxies with increasing specific star formation rate at fixed mass. With a consistent analysis of SDSS DR7 spectra, accounting for aperture corrections, we quantify the evolution of the stellar age and stellar metallicity scaling relations between z=0.7 and the present. We find negligible evolution in the stellar metallicity-mass relation of Q galaxies and for logM/Msun>11 galaxies in general. Lower mass SF galaxies, instead, have typically lower metallicities than their local counterparts, indicating significant enrichment since z~0.7 in the low-mass regime. The median of the stellar ages of both the general population and Q galaxies has changed by only 2 Gyr between z=0.7 and z=0.1, less than expected from cosmic aging. Some Q galaxies must evolve passively to reach the old boundary of the local population. However, in order to explain the evolution of the median trends, both individual evolution, through rejuvenation and/or minor merging impacting the outer galaxy regions, and population evolution, through quenching of massive, metal-rich star-forming galaxies, are required.

These protocluster `complexes', designated COSMOS-z3.1-A and COSMOS-z3.1-C, are the most prominent overdensities of $z=3.1$ Ly$\\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) identified in the COSMOS field by the One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey. These protocluster complexes have been followed up with extensive spectroscopy from Keck, Gemini, and DESI. Using a probabilistic method that combines photometrically selected and spectroscopically confirmed LAEs, we reconstruct the 3D structure of these complexes on scales of $\\approx$50 cMpc. We validate our reconstruction method using the IllustrisTNG300-1 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation and show that it consistently outperforms approaches relying solely on spectroscopic data. The resulting 3D maps reveal that both complexes are irregular and elongated along a single axis, emphasizing the impact of sightline on our perception of structure morphology. The complexes consist of multiple density peaks, ten in COSMOS-z3.1-A and four in COSMOS-z3.1-C. The former is confirmed to be a proto-supercluster, similar to {\\it Hyperion} at $z=2.4$ but observed at an even earlier epoch. Multiple `tails' connected to the cores of the density peaks are seen, likely representing cosmic filaments feeding into these extremely overdense regions. The 3D reconstructions further provide strong evidence that Ly$\\alpha$ blobs preferentially reside in the outskirts of the highest density regions. Descendant mass estimates of the density peaks suggest that COSMOS-z3.1-A and COSMOS-z3.1-C will evolve to become ultra-massive structures by $z=0$, with total masses $\\log(M/M_\\odot) \\gtrsim 15.3$, exceeding that of Coma.",

Eduardo Méndez-Delgado, Qiushi Chris Tian, the PHANGS Collaboration 27 pages, 14 figures. To be published in The Astronomical Journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The joint capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and JWST allow for an unparalleled look at the early lives of star clusters at near- and mid-infrared wavelengths. We present here a multiband analysis of embedded young stellar clusters in 11 nearby, star-forming galaxies, using the PHANGS-JWST and PHANGS-HST datasets. We use the Zooniverse citizen science platform to conduct an initial by-eye search for embedded clusters in near-UV/optical/near-infrared images that trace stellar continuum emission, the Paschen$\\alpha$ and H$\\alpha$ recombination lines, and the 3.3 $\\mu$m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon feature and its underlying continuum. With this approach, we identify 292 embedded cluster candidates for which we characterize their ages, masses, and levels of line-of-sight extinction by comparing the photometric data to predictions from stellar population models. The embedded cluster candidates have a median age of 4.5 Myr and an average line-of-sight extinction $\\left< A_V \\right> = 6.0$ mag. We determine lower limits on source stellar masses, resulting in a median stellar mass of $10^3$ $M_{\\odot}$. We use this sample of embedded cluster candidates to train multiple convolutional neural network models to carry out deep transfer learning-based searches for embedded clusters. With the aim of optimizing models for future catalog production, we compare results for four variations of training data using two neural networks. Confusion matrices for all eight model configurations, as well as inter-model identification trends, are presented. With refinement of the training sample, we determine that optimized models could serve as a pathway for future embedded cluster identification beyond our 11 galaxy sample.",

Maiorano 13 pages, including 6 figures and 3 tables; submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Probing the presence and properties of massive galaxies at high redshift is one of the most critical tests for galaxy formation models. In this work, we search for galaxies with stellar masses M* > 10^10.25 Msun at z in [5,7], i.e., towards the end of the Epoch of Reionisation, over a total of ~23 deg^2 in two of the Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) fields: the Euclid Deep Field North and Fornax (EDF-N and EDF-F). In addition to the Euclid photometry, we incorporate Spitzer Infrared Camera (IRAC) and ground-based optical data to perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, obtaining photometric redshifts and derived physical parameters. After applying rigorous selection criteria, we identify a conservative sample of 145 candidate massive galaxies with M* > 10^10.25 Msun at z in [5,7], including 5 objects with M* > 10^11 Msun. This makes for a surface density of about 6.3 deg^-2 at z in [5,7], which should be considered a lower limit because of the current depth of the Euclid data (H_E < 24, 5 sigma in Q1). We find that the inferred stellar masses are consistent with galaxy formation models with standard star-formation efficiencies. These massive galaxies have colour excess E(B-V) values up to 0.75, indicating significant dust attenuation in some of them. In addition, half of the massive galaxies have best-fit ages comparable to the age of the Universe at those redshifts, which suggests that their progenitors were formed very early in cosmic time. About 78% of the massive galaxies lie on the star-forming main sequence (MS) in the SFR-M* plane, ~12% are found in the starburst region, and 10% in the transition zone between the MS and starbursts. We find no significant evidence for outshining or AGN contamination that could account for the elevated specific star-formation rates (sSFR) observed in the ~12% of galaxies classified as starbursts.",

      "abstract": "Formation of Close Binaries through Massive Black Hole Perturbations and Chaotic Tides Howard Hao-Tse Huang, Wenbin Lu 22 pages, 16 figures, 1 table; to be submitted to The Open Journal of Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Hills breakup of binary systems allows massive black holes (MBH) to produce hyper-velocity stars (HVSs) and tightly bound stars. The long timescale of orbital relaxation means that binaries must spend numerous orbits around the MBH before they are tidally broken apart. Repeated MBH tidal perturbations over multiple pericenter passages can perturb the binary inner orbit to high eccentricities, leading to strong tidal interactions between the stars. In this work, we develop a physical model of the MBH-binary system, taking into account outer orbital relaxation, MBH tidal perturbations, and tidal interactions between the binaries in the form of dynamical tides. We show that when the inner orbit reaches high eccentricities such that the pericenter radius is only a few times stellar radii ($R_*$), the stellar oscillation modes can grow chaotically and rapidly harden the binaries to semi-major axes $a_b\\lesssim 10\\,R_*$. We find that a significant fraction (up to 50\\%) of initially wide binaries that are in the empty loss-cone regime ($a_b\\sim 1.0\\,{\\rm AU}$) do not undergo Hills breakup as wide binaries, but instead experience chaotic growth of tides and become close binaries. These tidally hardened binaries provide a new channel for the production of the fastest HVSs, and are connected to other nuclear transients such as repeating partial tidal disruption events and quasi-periodic eruptions.",

Lacey, Chris Power, Shihong Liao, Maxwell G. A. Maltz, Jack C. Turner 20 pages, 10 figures, submitted to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We explore how the choice of galaxy formation model affects the predicted properties of high-redshift galaxies. Using the FLARES zoom resimulation strategy, we compare the EAGLE hydrodynamics model and the GALFORM, L-Galaxies, SC-SAM and SHARK semi-analytic models (SAMs) at $5\\leq z \\leq 12$. The first part of our analysis examines the stellar mass functions, stellar-to-halo mass relations, star formation rates, and supermassive black hole (SMBH) properties predicted by the different models. Comparisons are made with observations, where relevant. We find general agreement between the range of predicted and observed stellar mass functions. The model predictions differ considerably when it comes to SMBH properties, with GALFORM and SHARK predicting between 1.5-3 dex more massive SMBHs ($M_{\\rm BH}>10^6\\ {\\rm M_\\odot}$) than L-Galaxies and SC-SAM, depending on redshift. The second half of our analysis focuses on passive galaxies. We show that in L-Galaxies and SC-SAM, environmental quenching of satellites is the prevalent quenching mechanism, with active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback having little effect at the redshifts probed. On the other hand, $\\sim40\\%$ of passive galaxies predicted by GALFORM and SHARK are quenched by AGN feedback at $z=5$. The SAMs are an interesting contrast to the EAGLE model, in which AGN feedback is essential for the formation of passive galaxies, in both satellites and centrals, even at high redshift.",

Shajib, Yiping Shu, Ran Li 20 pages, 10 figures, submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate potential systematic biases introduced by assumptions regarding stellar orbital anisotropy in joint lensing-dynamics modeling. Our study employs the massive early-type galaxies from the TNG100 simulation at redshifts z = 0.2, 0.5, and 0.7. Based on the simulated galaxies, we generate a self-consistent mock dataset containing both lensing and stellar kinematic observables. This is achieved through taking the potential composed of both dark matter and baryons of the simulated galaxies, plus the radial variation of the stellar orbit anisotropy depicted by a logistic function. By integrating constraints from both lensing and stellar kinematics, we separate the contributions of stars and dark matter inside the galaxies. Under three commonly adopted stellar anisotropy assumptions (isotropic orbits, constant anisotropy, and the Osipkov-Merritt profile), the model inferences suggest that the systematic biases in the total stellar mass and central dark matter fraction are not significant. Specifically, the total stellar mass on average is underestimated by less than $0.03\\pm0.10$ $\\rm dex$ while the dark matter fraction experiences only a statistically insignificant increase of less than $2\\%\\pm10\\%$ at the population level. The dark matter inner density slope in our tests is over-predicted by $0.15\\pm0.2$. Additionally, these lacks of significant biases are insensitive to the discrepancies between the assumed anisotropy in modeling and the ground truth orbital anisotropy of mock sample. Our results suggest that conventional assumptions regarding orbital anisotropy, such as an isotropic profile or the Osipkov-Merritt model, would not introduce a significant systematic bias when inferring galaxy mass density distribution at the population level.",

Diagnostic classification via the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagram indicates that the sample comprises 12 AGNs, 12 composite galaxies, 3 H{\\sc ii} galaxies, and 1 object of uncertain classification. A strong correlation is found between stellar mass and velocity dispersion. We examine the asymmetries of the narrow H$\\beta$ and find that the correlation between velocity offset and narrow H$\\beta$ skewness is negligible in both blue-shifted and red-shifted systems, suggesting that the rotating disk model may not fully explain the observed kinematics. The sample exhibits an asymmetric velocity offset distribution, with more red-shifted (17) than blue-shifted (11) objects. No significant correlation is observed between velocity offset and line width in blue-shifted systems, while red-shifted systems show a weak anti-correlation for narrow H$\\alpha$, which is inconsistent with the outflow model. The similarity in velocity offset between narrow emission lines supports the dual core system. Furthermore, the SDSS photometric images reveal eight objects with two cores and two with merger features. Based on the narrow emission line properties, the objects in our sample represent strong candidates for dual core systems exhibiting velocity offset. Extending this property to higher-redshift populations in the near future may facilitate the identification of merging supermassive black hole pairs at earlier cosmic epochs, providing critical constraints on their formation and evolution.",

Palicio Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) 3D maps of interstellar dust are crucial for understanding the structure of the Milky Way interstellar medium to apply correction to astrophysical observations affected by dust. We aim at providing new extinction estimates in the Gaia BP/RP bands to study the dust distribution in the disc, to provide new views of the spatial distribution of extinction and to compare it with tracers of the Galactic spiral arms. We use a highly homogeneous method based on the spectral chemo-physical parametrisation of stars from Gaia General Stellar Parametriser-Spectroscopy (GSP-Spec). This catalogue of 5.6 million stars in DR3, presents the advantage of estimating the stellar atmospheric parameters independently of extinction. The extinction is calculated by comparing the observed stellar (BP-RP) colours in the Gaia bands with the theoretical ones assuming a theoretical Teff-log(g)-[M/H] relation, from the GSP-Spec parameters. Publicly available, 3D high-resolution maps around the Sun are produced through the computation of differential extinction by discretising the dataset into spherical coordinates. Our large scale map covers a region of 4x4x0.8 kpc centred on the Sun with a discretisation of (dr,d{\\theta},d{\\phi})=(40pc,1°,1°). To exploit the higher number of stars in the Sun proximity, we created a smaller scale map focused on the Local Bubble area, with a volume of 1x1x0.8 kpc and a finer discretisation of (dr,d{\\theta},d{\\phi})=(30pc,1°,1°). The produced extinction maps exhibit a strong spatial correlation with molecular clouds and the spiral arms. Interestingly, several regions of the map are consistently present in different tracers as density of gas, of young stars and the chemical pattern of the spiral arms. Our study unveils the link between the distribution of dust, gas, and stars governing the chemical and dynamical evolution of the spiral arms in the Galactic framework.",

AstroSat far-UV imaging reveals clumpy emission features indicating recent star formation. Using MUSE integral field spectroscopy, we identify four star-forming complexes (SFCs) within the inner 10 kpc, each associated with localized ionized gas emission in distinct H$\\alpha$ velocity channels. Two of the SFCs, including a far-UV clump, appear on the blue-shifted side ($V_{H\\alpha}=-230~\\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$), while the other two are redshifted. The far-UV clump shows a strong velocity offset ($\\sim150~\\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$) and high gas dispersion ($\\sim250~\\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$), indicating that it is kinematically decoupled from the rotating disk. The spatial and velocity isolation of these features in the channel map confirms they do not follow regular disk rotation. The far-UV clump hosts young (250-500 Myr), extremely metal-poor ([M/H]$\\simeq$ -1.69) and $\\alpha$-enriched ($[\\alpha/Fe] \\sim 0.5$) stellar populations, sharply contrasting with the surrounding super-solar gas-phase metallicity. The young stellar populations in each SFC are chemically distinct (similar to the far-UV clump) from the enriched central ISM, indicating rapid, local star formation from primitive gas before efficient mixing with the enriched ISM. Their spatial and velocity segregation, age synchronicity, and chemical homogeneity suggest an origin of gas delivered by a disrupted, gas-rich dwarf on a high-inclination (off-plane) orbit. These results suggest that the central HSB within $\\rm \\sim 9^{\\prime\\prime} (14\\ kpc)$ radius component of Malin 1 has grown through discrete, externally driven accretion, contributing to its complex, hybrid disk morphology.",

Khosroshahi 6 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables, Proceedings of the International Symposium Astronomical Surveys and Big Data 3 (ASBD-3), to be published in the Communications of BAO (ComBAO) refereed journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Differences in metallicity between the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) offer an opportunity to examine whether environmental metallicity affects the performance of machine learning models in classifying dusty stellar sources. The five stellar classes studied include young stellar objects (YSOs), red supergiants (RSGs), post-asymptotic giant branch stars (PAGBs), and oxygen- and carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars (OAGBs and CAGBs), which are key phases of stellar evolution involved in dust production. Using spectroscopically labeled data from the Surveying the Agents of Galaxy Evolution (SAGE) project, we trained and evaluated a probabilistic random forest (PRF) classifier with four approaches: (1) separate training on LMC and SMC, including all five classes, (2) excluding the underpopulated PAGB class, (3) combined LMC and SMC datasets, and (4) cross-galaxy training and testing. The model achieved 93\\% accuracy on the SMC and 88\\% on the LMC across all five classes. In the SMC, PAGB sources were misclassified as YSOs, mainly because of their small sample size (4 objects). When PAGB was excluded, both the LMC and the SMC reached 92\\% accuracy. A combined dataset produced the same accuracy, and cross-galaxy training yielded similar results, indicating that metallicity does not significantly impact model performance. A comparison of absolute CMDs for the LMC and SMC confirms their similarity in stellar populations. These findings suggest that environmental metallicity has little effect on ML-based classification of dusty stellar sources, supporting the use of combined datasets and cross-galaxy models in low-metallicity environments.",

Velocity slices at different kinematic distances show similar spatial power spectra (SPSs) and structure functions (SFs), demonstrating that the entire region forms a single turbulent field with a cascade extending from $\\sim 400$ pc to sub-parsec scales. The SPS slopes of both the intensity and velocity fields exhibit a systematic scale dependence that approaches the values expected from turbulence models. Cloud-to-cloud VSFs follow similar trends to the pixel-by-pixel VSFs in the extended self-similarity (ESS) scaling, indicating that velocity differences among clouds arise from large-scale turbulent motions. Velocity- and intensity-increment maps reveal filamentary, intermittent structures. The PDFs of the velocity increments display strong non-Gaussianity and are well fitted by the normal inverse gaussian (NIG) distribution, whereas the intensity increments show much weaker tails. A simple energetic estimate suggests that Galactic differential rotation is able to supply the large-scale shear required to maintain the observed turbulence.",

This research is concerned with assessing and comparing the operational capabilities of the two methods and, in particular, the impact on observable reproduction, orbit classifications and computer elapsed times when using low orbit numbers (8000 orbits) with different observational data sets and initial conditions. Both methods are able to reproduce observed data with mean $\\chi^2 \\approx 1$ or less. However, the made-to-measure process does so three to five times faster than the orbit superposition method, and this starts to make the made-to-measure process attractive for analyzing galaxy surveys.

Orbits which are common do not have the same weights. Different initial conditions result in different classifications.",

This multi-wavelength dataset combines optical emission line data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with X-ray fluxes from Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray space telescopes. Using diagnostic emission line ratios, we constructed Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagrams, introduced in 1981 to classify galaxies based on nuclear activity. Our analysis reveals that most red spirals exhibit AGN or low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) signatures, based on optical data, as determined by their location in the BPT, Cid Fernandes, and Mazzolari diagrams. These results are consistent with the presence of negative feedback from AGNs quenching star formation. Conversely, X-ray analysis reveals that many blue spirals exhibit high X-ray luminosities and are situated in the AGN region of emission line ratio diagrams, suggesting that AGN-driven positive feedback may be enhancing star formation. Our findings support the hypothesis that AGN feedback plays a key role in the evolution of spiral galaxies, particularly in quenching star formation and driving the transition from blue to red spiral systems.",

Baugh (ICC, Durham), Cedric Lacey (ICC, Durham) Submitted to MNRAS; 16 pages, 7 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The properties of high-redshift sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs) remain controversial within hierarchical structure formation models. We revisit whether a top-heavy stellar initial mass function (IMF) in starbursts is required to reproduce both SMG observations and local galaxy properties. Using Bayesian optimisation, we perform an extensive search of the 15-dimensional parameter space of the GALFORM semi-analytical model. This efficient approach converges to optimal parameter values in fewer than 200 model evaluations, representing orders of magnitude fewer runs than traditional methods. We test whether GALFORM can simultaneously match three key observational constraints: the $z=0$ $K$-band luminosity function, the SMG number counts at 850~$\\mu$m, and the SMG redshift distribution. We consider two model variants: one with a universal solar neighbourhood IMF for all star formation, and another allowing the IMF slope in starbursts to vary as a free parameter. When assuming a universal Chabrier IMF, we find no parameter combination that simultaneously reproduces all three datasets. The model either matches the SMG constraints while grossly overpredicting the local $K$-band luminosity function, or matches the local luminosity function while severely underpredicting SMG counts by factors of 3--100. In contrast, allowing a top-heavy IMF in starbursts enables excellent simultaneous fits to all constraints. The best-fitting model prefers an IMF slope parameter $x \\approx 0.7$ (where d$n$/dlog$m \\propto m^{-x}$), somewhat more top-heavy than recent models but less extreme than early proposals. Our comprehensive parameter space exploration definitively confirms that, within the GALFORM framework, a top-heavy IMF in starbursts is necessary to reconcile high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies with local galaxy populations.",

In order to investigate the production of P by supernovae, we performed near-infrared (IR) [P II] and [Fe II] line mapping of 26 Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) with the Infrared Survey Facility and Kanata telescopes, using the narrow-band filters tuned to these lines. By combining our data with archival [Fe II] maps from UKIRT, we detected both the [P II] and [Fe II] emissions in five SNRs, only the [Fe II] emission in 15 SNRs, and no line emissions in the remaining six. Using the observed [P II]/[Fe II] ratios and upper limits for non-detections, we derived the P/Fe abundance ratios, which vary by up to two orders of magnitude among our sample SNRs. This suggests that the production rate of P and/or the degree of dust destruction may differ from remnant to remnant, the latter being due to the fact that P is volatile while Fe is mostly locked in dust grains. We used the mid- and far-IR maps to examine the dust content for the five SNRs where both the line emissions are detected. As a result, we find that high P/Fe abundance ratios in the northern and southeastern regions of Cassiopeia A and the Crab Nebula, respectively, are not likely due to dust destruction but may reflect an asymmetric ejection of P during supernova explosions. In the Crab Nebula, it is also possible that near-IR [Ni II] emission contaminates the observed flux in the southeastern region, suggesting that the Ni/Fe abundance ratio, rather than the P/Fe abundance ratio, is relatively high in this part of the remnant.",

Sales Accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We study fast nuclear winds driven by Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) feedback in merging galaxies using high-resolution hydrodynamics simulations. We use Stars and MUltiphase Gas in GaLaxiEs (SMUGGLE) to explicitly model the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) and employ sub-grid dynamical friction for massive black holes (BHs). Furthermore, we use a super-Lagrangian refinement scheme to resolve AGN feedback coupling to the ISM at $\\sim10-100\\,$pc scales. By comparison between merging and isolated galaxies, with and without AGN feedback, we identify trends in the complex interplay between dynamics, BH fueling and feedback, and star formation and feedback. We consider three galaxy types: Milky Way analogs, Sbc-type galaxies, and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) analogs. The synergy between AGN feedback and merger dynamics is strongest in the Milky Way-like mergers, where the AGN winds are energetically dominant and entrain more gas when the initially thin disks become thick and amorphous during the merger. In contrast, the merger of thicker, vigorously star-forming Sbc galaxies is not strongly impacted by AGN feedback until star formation declines in the post-merger phase. Finally, while the sub-grid dynamical friction prescription effectively retains BHs in galactic nuclei during more massive mergers, the clumpy multiphase ISM induces significant wandering of low-mass BHs $\\mathrm{(<10^5M_\\odot)}$ in the shallow potentials of the SMC-like galaxies. These low-mass BHs wander at distances $\\gtrsim 2$ kpc from the galactic center, yielding negligible BH accretion and feedback. This has implications for LISA event rates and present a further challenge to understanding the rapid growth of $z\\sim7-10$ quasars discovered by JWST.",

Dias Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Globular clusters in the Galactic bulge are difficult to study due to high extinction and severe crowding. VVV-CL001 is an old, metal-poor, and fast cluster in the inner bulge, whose extreme properties make it a key probe of the early chemical and dynamical evolution of the Milky Way. We derive its fundamental parameters by combining spectroscopy, astrometry, and near-infrared photometry. Metallicity and radial velocity were measured from medium-resolution FORS2/VLT spectra; proper motions from Gaia DR3; and FourStar/Magellan photometry was used to refine the cluster centre, derive its structure, and estimate age, distance, and reddening. VVV-CL001 is confirmed to be an old ($12.1^{+1.0}_{-1.2}$ Gyr), metal-poor ($[\\text{Fe}/\\text{H}] = -2.25 \\pm 0.05$) cluster at a heliocentric distance of $7.1^{+1.3}_{-1.1}$ kpc, with reddening $E(J-K_s) = 1.40^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$. Its mean proper motions are $\\mu_\\alpha^* = -3.68 \\pm 0.09$ and $\\mu_\\delta = -1.76 \\pm 0.10$ mas yr$^{-1}$, and its radial velocity is $-334 \\pm 4$ km s$^{-1}$. The orbit is eccentric ($e = 0.76^{+0.10}_{-0.14}$), confined to the inner Galaxy ($|Z|_{\\max} \\approx 1$ kpc) and within the bar's influence ($R < 5$ kpc), with pericentre $0.6^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ kpc and apocentre $4.5^{+2.5}_{-1.2}$ kpc. Its old age, low metallicity, and orbital properties support an in-situ origin, identifying VVV-CL001 as one of the most metal-poor inner-Galaxy clusters formed in the early Milky Way. It likely belongs to the primordial disk cluster population later trapped by the bar, making it a fossil remnant of the earliest phases of Galactic assembly.",

Veenema, B. Kerkeni, A. Alonso-Herrero, L. Hermosa Muñoz, G. Speranza 11 pages, 8 figures, 1 appendix with 2 figures, Accepted by MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We have carried out a detailed analysis of the 3.4 micron spectral feature arising from Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH), using JWST archival data. For the first time in an external galaxy (NGC 6240), we have identified two distinct spectral components of the PAH 3.4 micron feature: a shorter wavelength component at 3.395 micron, which we attribute to short aliphatic chains tightly attached to the aromatic rings of the PAH molecules; and a longer wavelength feature at 3.405 microns that arises from longer, more fragile, aliphatic chains that are weakly attached to the parent PAH molecule. These longer chains are more easily destroyed by far-ultraviolet photons (>5eV) and PAH thermal emission only occurs where PAH molecules are shielded from more energetic photons by dense molecular gas. We see a very strong correlation in the morphology of the PAH 3.395 micron feature with the PAH 3.3 micron emission, the latter arising from robust aromatic PAH molecules. We also see an equally strong correlation between the PAH 3.405 micron morphology and the warm molecular gas, as traced by H2 vibrational lines. We show that the flux ratio PAH_3.395/PAH_3.405 < 0.3 corresponds strongly to regions where the PAH molecules are shielded by dense molecular gas, so that only modestly energetic UV photons penetrate to excite the PAHs. Our work shows that PAH 3.405 micron and PAH 3.395 micron emission features can provide robust diagnostics of the physical conditions of the interstellar medium in external galaxies, and can be used to quantify the energies of the photon field penetrating molecular clouds.",

The exquisite S/N reveals multiple high-ionization nebular lines and broad Balmer and [OIII] components (FWHM$\\sim700-3000$ km s$^{-1}$). We detect broadened HeII $\\lambda$1640 and $\\lambda$4687 (FWHM$\\sim530$ km s$^{-1}$) and strong NIII] $\\lambda$4642 emission consistent with a population of WN stars, making RXCJ2248 the most distant galaxy with confirmed WR features to date. We measure the multi-phase nebular density across five ions, the direct-method metallicity ($12+\\log(\\rm O/H)= 7.749\\pm0.023$), and a non-uniform elemental enrichment pattern of extreme N/O enhancement ($\\log(\\rm N/O)=-0.390\\pm0.035$ from N$^+$, N$^{+2}$, and N$^{+3}$) and suppressed C/O relative to empirical C/N trends. We show that this abundance pattern can be explained by enrichment from a dual-burst with a low WC/WN ratio, as expected at low metallicities. Crucially, these signatures can only arise during a brief, rare evolutionary window shortly after a burst ($\\sim3-6$ Myr), when WN stars dominate chemical feedback but before dilution by later yields (e.g., supernovae). The observed frequency of strong N emitters at high$-z$ implies a $\\sim50$ Myr burst duty cycle, suggesting that N/O outliers may represent a brief but ubiquitous phase in the evolution of highly star-forming early galaxies. The detection in RXCJ2248, therefore, provides the first direct evidence of WN-driven chemical enrichment in the early Universe and a novel timing argument for the bursty star formation cycles that shaped galaxies at cosmic dawn.",

Millar Accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Chemical reaction networks are central to all chemical models. Each rate coefficient has an associated uncertainty, which is generally not taken into account when calculating the chemistry. We performed the first uncertainty analysis of a chemical model of C-rich and O-rich AGB outflows using the Rate22 reaction network. Quantifying the error on the model predictions enables us to determine the need for adding complexity to the model. Using a Monte Carlo sampling method, we quantified the impact of the uncertainties on the chemical kinetic data on the predicted fractional abundances and column densities. The errors are caused by a complex interplay of reactions forming and destroying each species. Parent species show an error on their envelope sizes, which is not caused by the uncertainty on their photodissociation rate, but rather the chemistry reforming the parent after its photodissociation. Using photodissociation models to estimate the envelope size might be an oversimplification. The error on the CO envelope impacts retrieved mass-loss rates by up to a factor of two. For daughter species, the error on the peak fractional abundance ranges from a factor of a few to three orders of magnitude, and is on average about 10\\% of its value. This error is positively correlated with the error on the column density. The standard model suffices for many species, e.g., the radial distribution of cyanopolyynes and hydrocarbon radicals around IRC +10216. However, including spherical asymmetries, dust-gas chemistry, and photochemistry induced by a close-by stellar companion are still necessary to explain certain observations.",

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present JWST observations of the radio galaxy TGSSJ1530+1049, spectroscopically confirmed at $z=4.0$. NIRCam images and NIRSpec/IFU spectroscopy ($R=2700$) show that TGSSJ1530+1049 is part of one of the densest-known structures of continuum and line-emitting objects found at these redshifts. NIRCam images show a number of distinct continuum objects and evidence of interactions traced by diffuse emission, and the NIRSpec IFU cube reveals further strong line emitting regions. We identify six continuum and four additional strong Halpha emitting sources with weaker or no underlying continuum within the 3''x3'' IFU field. From spatial alignment with high-resolution radio data and emission line profiles, the radio AGN host galaxy is clearly identified. The bright Halpha emission (but not the optical components) is distributed remarkably linearly along the radio axis, suggestive of a biconical illumination zone by a central obscured AGN. The emission line kinematics indicate jet-gas interactions on scales of a few kpc. However, due to large relative velocities and presence of underlying continuum, the alignment with the radio structure appears to be, at least partly, caused by a particular configuration of interacting galaxies. At least four objects within a 10x10 (projected) kpc^2 area which includes the radio source have high stellar masses (log($M_\\star/M_\\odot)>10.3$) and star formation rates in the range 70-163 $M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Using a stellar mass-based analysis, we predict a total dark matter halo mass of $\\approx10^{13} M_\\odot$. Based on the physical separations and velocity differences between the galaxies, it is expected that these galaxies will merge to form a massive galaxy within a few Gyr. The system qualitatively resembles the forming brightest cluster galaxies in cosmological simulations that form early through a rapid succession of mergers.",

See also the companion paper by Saxena et al Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) High-redshift radio galaxies can provide insights into the structure formation and galaxy evolution at earlier cosmological epochs. TGSSJ1530+1049 was selected as a candidate high-redshift radio galaxy. Subsequent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) presented in a companion paper (Saxena et al., submitted) have shown that it is located at a redshift z=4.0. The JWST data furthermore showed that the radio source is part of one of the densest structures of galaxies and ionized gas known at these redshifts. The complex system qualitatively resembles a massive (cluster) galaxy forming early through a rapid succession of mergers. TGSSJ1530+1049 is an unresolved source down to ~0.6\" scale in multiple radio surveys. To reveal its high-resolution radio structure and allow for a detailed comparison with JWST observations, we studied its morphology at various angular scales with different radio interferometric instruments. We observed TGSSJ1530+1049 at milliarcsecond (mas) scale angular resolution with the European VLBI Network (EVN), and at ~100-mas scale resolution with the enhanced Multi-Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN). We recovered a complex north--south oriented structure with steep-spectrum radio-emitting features, which are associated with lobes and hot spots of a jetted active galactic nucleus. The centre of the radio galaxy proved to be too faint at cm wavelengths to be unambiguously detected in our observations. Nevertheless, the linear size (~5.5 kpc) and the radio power place it among the so-called medium-sized symmetric objects, a smaller and/or confined version of larger radio galaxies. Comparison between the radio morphology and that of the ionized gas observed by JWST shows that the two are closely aligned. However, the optical emission line gas extends out to ~25 kpc, which is well beyond the detected radio structures. (Abridged)",

Among the five instruments onboard the CSST, the Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) offers the unique ability to simultaneously capture spatial and spectral information across a field of view of no less than $6^{''}\\times6^{''}$. Key advantages of the IFS include a high spatial resolution of $0.2^{''}$ and a broad spectral coverage from 350 to 1000 nm, making it an ideal instrument for studying physical processes in the vicinity of supermassive black holes within galaxies. To more accurately assess the technical and scientific performance of the CSST-IFS, it is essential to develop a simulation tool that incorporates realistic effects from all optical components. Such a simulation will form an integral part of the CSST-IFS data and pipeline system, enabling the development of the data reduction pipeline well ahead of actual observations. This paper presents an end-to-end simulation workflow for the CSST-IFS, incorporating a wide range of instrumental effects that may influence its spectral and imaging performance. The simulation accounts for optical diffraction effects introduced by all components, such as image slicers and slit array, as well as sub-pixel effects from gratings. It also includes various detector noises, frame-shifting effects, and charge-transfer inefficiency. Real observational conditions--such as target Doppler shift, cosmic rays, and other in-orbit operational effects--are also considered. We describe the technical implementation of the simulation and present results that quantitatively characterize key instrument parameters.",

We find a clear positive correlation between the rotational velocity (v sin i) and color of eMSTO stars, supporting the role of stellar rotation and gravity darkening in causing the observed color spread. Contrary to predictions from binary tidal-locking scenarios, spatial distribution analysis reveals that fast-rotating stars are preferentially concentrated in the cluster's central regions. This finding provides the observational evidence favoring star-disk interactions during the pre-main-sequence phase, rather than tidal locking in binaries, as the primary mechanism responsible for the origin of rotational spread in eMSTO stars.",

Yeghikyan Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Research on young stellar populations is essential to understand the properties of embedded clusters and advance theories of their formation. This has driven advancements in methodologies for star detection, leading to the development of valuable databases and software. We present the scientific justification and operating principles of the IdentYS tool, which is designed to identify young stellar objects (YSOs) in star-forming regions. The tool facilitates the identification of young stars with infrared (IR) excess in remote and embedded star-forming regions, focusing primarily on Class I and II YSOs. For this purpose, near- and mid-IR photometric data and five colour-colour diagrams (J - H) vs. (H - K), K - [3.6] vs. [3.6] - [4.5], [3.6] - [4.5] vs. [5.8] - [8.0], [3.6] - [4.5] vs. [8.0] - [24], and [3.4] - [4.6] vs. [4.6] - [12] are used. The purity of the YSOs sample is enhanced by excluding field contamination from stellar and extragalactic objects. As a result, we compile a list of YSO candidates displaying the source designation, astrometric, and photometric parameters, as well as information on the evolutionary stage determined by the presence of IR excess, as indicated by certain diagrams. The application of this program can greatly streamline the statistical analysis of young stellar populations across diverse star-forming regions, including distant and deeply embedded ones, which typically require processing large volumes of initial data.",

We analyse a suite of stratified box simulations modelling a realistic ISM that aims to probe environments similar to those found in the Milky Way. Turbulence is injected through stellar feedback and an external large-scale driving force. We find that star formation can be either boosted or reduced when increasing the external driving strength, depending on the environment. When the density is sufficiently high, warm neutral gas naturally transitions to the cold phase, leading to high cold neutral medium (CNM) fractions of around 40\\%. Under these conditions, excessive large-scale driving leads to a slight reduction of the CNM fraction and an increase in the amount of gas that is thermally unstable. What limits the star formation in this regime is a reduced fraction of dense gas due to additional turbulent support against collapse. For low density regions, overdensities in which cooling is efficient are much rarer and we find that star formation is regulated by the formation of cold gas. In such cases, turbulence can significantly boost star formation by compressing gas in shocks and increasing the CNM fraction dramatically. In our simulations we see an increase from almost no CNM to up to a fraction of 15 \\% when including external turbulence driving; leading to an associated increase in the star formation rate. We provide a model to quantify this behaviour and predict the CNM fraction by combining the standard ISM cooling/heating model with the density PDF generated by turbulence. The change in the dominant limiting process for star formation between low- and intermediate-density environments provides a natural explanation for the observed break in the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation around column densities of 9\\,\\Msun\\, pc$^{-2}$.",

Shannon, Yuanming Wang, Ziteng Wang, Dong Yang 23 pages, 10 figures, accepted to PASA Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We probe the atomic hydrogen (HI) emission from the host galaxies of fast radio bursts (FRBs) to investigate the emerging trend of disturbance and asymmetry in the population. Quadrupling the sample size, we detect 16 out of 17 new hosts in HI, with the single non-detection arising in a galaxy known to be transitioning towards quiescence. With respect to typical local Universe galaxies, FRB hosts are generally massive in HI ($M_{HI}>10^9 M_\\odot$), which aligns with previous studies reporting that FRB hosts also tend to have high stellar masses and are star-forming. However, they span a broad range of other HI derived properties. Using visual inspection alongside various asymmetry metrics, we identify six unambiguously settled host galaxies, demonstrating for the first time that a disturbed HI morphology is not a universal feature of FRB host galaxies. However, we find another six that show clear signs of disturbance, one borderline case, and three which require deeper or more targeted observations to reach a conclusion; this brings the confirmed ratio of disturbed-to-settled FRB hosts to 11:6. Given that roughly a 1:1 ratio is expected for random background galaxies of similar type, our observed ratio yields a p-value of 0.222. Therefore, we conclude that contrary to earlier indications, there is no statistically significant excess of HI disturbance in this sample of FRB host galaxies with respect to the general galaxy population, and hence we find no evidence for a fundamental connection between FRB progenitor formation and merger-induced star formation activity.",

In contrast to large, steady disk galaxies like the Milky Way, high-redshift galaxies are often characterized by clumpy, disturbed morphologies and bursty star formation histories. These differences between low-mass, bursty galaxies and higher-mass, steady star-forming galaxies have recently been studied in galaxy formation simulations with resolved multiphase ISM. These simulation studies indicate that while steady disk galaxies can be well-modeled as \"equilibrium disks\" embedded in a distinct, hot CGM, bursty galaxies are much more dynamic and their star formation occurs in a dispersion-dominated medium that extends to halo scales, with no clear boundary between the ISM and the CGM. We develop an analytic framework to model star formation in bursty galaxies that are not adequately modeled as equilibrium disks. The framework approximates the gas in low-mass halos as a continuous, supersonically turbulent medium with large density fluctuations. Star formation occurs locally in the high-density tail of a roughly lognormal density distribution. This is analogous to turbulent models of star formation in molecular clouds, but here applied on inner CGM scales. By comparing with galaxy formation simulations from the FIRE project, we show that this framework can be used to understand star formation efficiencies and radial profiles in halos. The turbulent framework shows explicitly how the instantaneous galaxy-averaged star formation efficiency can be relatively low even if the local efficiency in dense gas approaches unity.",

Using a quasi-steady Reynolds decomposition, we separate mean and turbulent components. In quasi-isobaric TRMLs, upstream gas cools and compresses before streamwise momentum is fully mixed, yielding a negative shear stress (R_{xz}) and a positive compressive stress (R_{zz}) that together sustain a steady radiative conversion of hot to cold gas. A pronounced thermal-pressure dip develops within the TRML, while radiative losses are offset by the divergences of enthalpy flux and (subdominant) turbulent heat flux (Q_t). The volume-averaged temperature follows a tanh profile, resulting in universal emissivity distributions that are consistent with simulations. Contrary to previous claims, the cooling-rate surface density saturates and becomes independent of box size in the strong-cooling limit, establishing the universal structure of TRMLs.",

Submitted to A&A. Comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present the analysis of the stellar and interstellar medium (ISM) properties of MARTA-4327, a star-forming galaxy at z=2.224 observed by means of deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy in both medium- and high-resolution gratings as part of the \"Measuring Abundances at high Redshift with the Te Approach\" (MARTA) programme. We report one of the highest-redshift detections of the Wolf-Rayet (WR) blue and red bumps in a non-lensed system. The broad He ii${\\lambda}$4686 feature is consistent with a young (${\\sim 5-6}$ Myr) burst dominated by WN stars, although both SSP models and empirical templates struggle to reproduce the nitrogen stellar features at ${\\approx}$ 4640 A. Based on the relative strength of the available optical stellar features, we disfavor the presence of very massive stars (VMS) in this system. Elemental abundance ratios such as Ne/O, N/O, and Ar/O align with observations of local star-forming galaxies (including WR galaxies), suggesting that any impact of the WR population on the chemical enrichment of the ISM is strongly localized. However, the gas-phase Fe/O ratio appears enhanced compared to local galaxies of similar metallicity, which we interpret as evidence for reduced Fe depletion onto dust grains, possibly linked to localized destruction in WR-driven wind environments. In addition, we detect a broad and blueshifted (~70 km/s) H${\\alpha}$ component, revealing the presence of an ionized outflow with a mass loading factor ${\\eta \\sim 0.2}$. Finally, we report the robust detection of O I${\\lambda}$8446 emission (among the firsts at high redshift), which we interpret as originating from Ly${\\beta}$ fluorescence and/or collisional excitation in dense clumps. Overall, MARTA-4327 represents a unique system for studying the role of massive stars in shaping the ISM in galaxies at Cosmic Noon.",

Naidu) is available to download from this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The detection of strong Balmer breaks and absorption features in Little Red Dots (LRDs) suggests they host AGN embedded within dense gas envelopes, potentially powered by super-Eddington accretion. We present GLIMPSE-17775, a luminous ($L_{\\rm bol}\\sim10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$) LRD at $z=3.501$ behind Abell S1063 ($\\mu\\sim2$), observed with deep JWST/NIRCam and a $\\sim$20 hr (80 hr de-lensed) NIRSpec/G395M spectrum. The data reveal 40+ emission and absorption features, including a rich forest of low-ionization FeII lines and numerous broad hydrogen recombination transitions. We use this depth to test the dense-gas interpretation through five independent diagnostics. Nearly all permitted lines show exponential wings with consistent FWHM, the signature of Thomson scattering requiring $n_e\\gtrsim10^8$ cm$^{-3}$. Adopting this width yields $M_{\\rm BH}\\sim10^{6.7}M_\\odot$, a factor of ten lower than Gaussian fits, and $\\lambda_{\\rm Edd}\\sim1.8$. Additional diagnostics support the same picture: a pronounced Balmer break ($f_{\\nu,4050}/f_{\\nu,3670}=2.0\\pm0.1$), enhanced HeI $\\lambda7065$ and $\\lambda10830$ with P-Cygni absorption, Bowen-fluorescent OI $\\lambda8446$-$\\lambda11290$ emission requiring Ly$\\beta$ pumping, and 16 FeII lines matching fluorescence models. These features indicate a dense ($n\\sim10^8$ cm$^{-3}$), partially ionized cocoon where scattering and fluorescence dominate line formation, providing strong evidence that at least some LRDs are powered by super-Eddington black-hole growth in the early Universe.",

Barrow, Susie Byrom, Varun Satish 25 pages, 12 figures, 1 table, submitted to MNRAS on July 30th, 2025 and accepted with moderate revision. Revision submitted on November 6th, 2025. Accepted for publication on November 14th, 2025 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Accurately modeling molecular hydrogen ($\\text{H}_{2}$) is an important task in cosmological simulations because it regulates star formation. One fundamental property of $\\text{H}_{2}$ is the ability to self-shield, a phenomenon in which the $\\text{H}_{2}$ in the outer layer of a molecular cloud absorbs the photodissociating Lyman-Werner UV radiation and shields the inner $\\text{H}_{2}$. Historically, numerical approximations have been utilized to avoid intensive ray-tracing calculations. This paper evaluates the use of the Sobolev-like density-gradient approximation in $\\text{H}_{2}$ self-shielding modeling and tests its agreement with a more rigorous adaptive ray-tracing method in cosmological simulations. We ran four high-resolution zoom-in cosmological simulations to investigate the models' effects in the early Reionization Era ($z \\geq 12$). We find that the approximation model returns a higher $\\text{H}_{2}$ photodissociation rate in low gas density environments but a lower rate when gas density is high, resulting in low-mass halos having less $\\text{H}_{2}$ while high-mass halos having more $\\text{H}_{2}$. The approximation also hinders star formation in small halos, but it less affects the stellar mass of larger halos. Inside a halo, the discrepancies between the two models regarding $\\text{H}_{2}$ fraction, temperature, and stellar mass are radially dependent. On a large scale, the simulations using the approximation have less $\\text{H}_{2}$ in the intergalactic medium and may experience a slower reionization process. These results show that the Sobolev-like approximation alters properties of galaxies and the large-scale universe when compared to the ray-tracing treatment, emphasizing a need for caution when interpreting results from these two techniques in cosmological simulations.",

First, Fe abundance rises with $\\sigma$, but only until $\\sigma\\approx100$ km s$^{-1}$, after which it falls. This kink is reproduced by TNG100 simulations, implying that hierarchical merger processes might explain it. Second, astrophysical scatter in N is high for galaxies with $\\sigma < 100$ km s$^{-1}$. Due to the restricted list of nucleosynthetic sources for N, it is likely that asymptotic giant branch stars provide most of this N. A varied star formation history (compared to that of massive galaxies) along with variable retention and recycling of N-enriched gas might explain the fuzz of N abundance in low-$\\sigma$ galaxies. Because a timescale argument seems necessary to explain the nitrogen fuzz, and an initial mass function argument is ruled out, similar timescale arguments for the [Mg/Fe] trend as a function of velocity dispersion are supported.",

Nebular conditions are consistent with young ($\\lesssim5\\times10^6$ years) and very massive stars.

In this work, we present the first detailed study of the role of triple stellar evolution in forming the population of LISA double white dwarfs. We use the multiple stellar evolution code (MSE) to model the stellar evolution, binary interactions, and the dynamics of triple star systems then use a Milky Way-like galaxy from the TNG50 simulations to construct a representative sample of LISA double white dwarfs. In our simulations about $7\\times10^6$ Galactic double white dwarfs in the LISA frequency bandwidth originate from triple systems, whereas $\\sim4\\times10^6$ form from isolated binary stars. The properties of double white dwarfs formed in triples closely resemble those formed from isolated binaries, but we also find a small number of systems $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10)$ that reach extreme eccentricities $(>0.9)$, a feature unique to the dynamical formation channels. Our population produces $\\approx 10^{4} $ individually resolved double white dwarfs (from triple and binary channels) and an unresolved stochastic foreground below the level of the LISA instrumental noise.

Detailed comparisons to the spectral observations reveal that the H$\\alpha$ line is too broad, the Fe II red wing is too bright, and the NUV continuum decays too slowly in a fiducial high-flux beam model. However, chromospheric condensations with maximum electron densities of $n_e \\approx 5 \\times 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$ and optical depths $\\tau \\approx 1$ in the near wing of H$\\alpha$ are consistent with the observed intensity of a broad spectrum in the Southern ribbon. Model similarities demonstrate that Fe I emission lines and the FUV continuum intensity can form at chromospheric heights during flares, but I find that the ratios of the NUV to FUV continuum intensities are generally too large in the models. This suggests that radiative-hydrodynamic models of chromospheric condensations cool through $T \\approx 30,000$ K too rapidly.

Recent discoveries of hypervelocity stars provide unique constraints, as these stars likely represent the surviving companions of such explosions. Using detailed binary evolution models computed with MESA and population synthesis with MSE, we investigate the outcomes of hot subdwarf + white dwarf binaries undergoing helium accretion. We find that donors can nearly exhaust their helium and form compact, C/O cores before explosion. The predicted ejection velocities span a broad distribution reaching up to $\\sim 1000\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$, with D6-2 representing the extreme high-velocity tail of this population. We estimate analytically that the thin residual helium envelope can be stripped by the supernova ejecta, producing a C/O-rich surface composition consistent with the observed spectrum. The Type Ia supernova rate from this channel is ${\\sim}(1.69\\pm0.06)\\times10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot^{-1}}$, consistent with 1% of the observed Type Ia supernova rate. Hot subdwarf + white dwarf binaries containing nearly exhausted He-star donors can therefore naturally explain the velocity and composition of D6-2 while providing a quantitatively consistent contribution to the observed Type Ia supernova rate. Our models predict a distribution of surviving donor remnants with various core He fractions and with ejection velocities extending down to $\\sim 450\\,\\mathrm{ km\\,s^{-1}}$. The orbital velocities of donor stars in this progenitor channel naturally yield orbital velocities consistent with US 708, LP 40-365 stars, and D6-2, indicating that a single class of thermonuclear supernova progenitors can account for their entire range of ejection velocities.",

We aim to obtain an accurate reconstruction of the surface spot distribution on the young, rapidly rotating K2 star PW And by combining spectroscopic and photometric diagnostics. In particular, we seek to assess how the inclusion of continuous high-precision TESS photometry in parallel with high-resolution spectroscopy improves latitude recovery of starspots, especially at low latitudes and in the southern hemisphere, which are poorly constrained by Doppler imaging (DI) alone. We explore the spatial origins of the observed white-light flares. We performed simultaneous Doppler imaging and light curve inversion (DI+LCI) using contemporaneous high-resolution GAOES-RV spectra from the 3.8 m Seimei telescope (R~65000) and high-precision TESS light curves. Surface reconstructions employ the SpotDIPy code to model both line profiles and continuum brightness variations. We compare DI+LCI maps with DI-only solutions, conduct artificial-spot simulations to evaluate the effects of latitude, phase coverage, and S/N on reconstruction reliability. We also investigate the spatial correlation between the DI+LCI reconstructed map and flares detected in the TESS data. The DI+LCI reconstruction reveals significant spot features at mid-to-low latitudes, equatorial regions, and even in the southern hemisphere. Simulations show that DI+LCI provides more accurate reconstructions than DI-only, especially under conditions of incomplete phase coverage and low S/N, by better recovering both spot latitudes and filling factors. A comparison between the DI+LCI map and the TESS flare timings also suggests potential association between flare occurrence and reconstructed spot longitudes.",

These multiple giant eruptions (MGEs) may have a commutative effect that brings the star to a different state, possible one that favors the explosion. To address this problem, we evolve a 100 solar mass star and initiate a series of three giant eruptions lasting one year each, testing different mass loss rates and different metallicities. Following each eruption, we track the recovery phase to examine the post-eruption behavior of the star and its recovery timescale. The MGEs lead to a decrease in luminosity, accompanied by a slight increase in temperature. Later, during the recovery phases as the star starts to retain its equilibrium state, its luminosity increases. The recovery time-scale varies significantly after each eruption for independent on the mass loss rate, but it is shorter for lower metallicities. For the higher mass-loss rates during the recovery phase, the outer layers of the star exhibit oscillations and undergo compression at higher metallicity. These oscillations are most likely a consequence of thermal imbalance in the outer envelope. This behavior at higher mass-loss rates also suggests that the thermal readjustments during recovery may create favorable conditions for a subsequent eruption of the star.",

Our new observations are from the South African Astronomical Observatory. The objects and salient results are as follows: (i) 6dF0752-54 is a dwarf nova with an orbital period Porb = 5.05 hr that shows a contribution from a mid-M type secondary in its mean spectrum. (ii) J0916-26 had been suspected of being a magnetic CV with an eclipse period of 3.37 hr. Our spectrum corroborates this classification. (iii) GSC 08944 is a novalike variable with Porb = 3.80 hr. Archival photometry also shows a persistent photometric period near 4.03 hr, apparently from a positive super- hump. Its emission line behavior is consistent with an SW Sextantis-type novalike. (iv) MGAB-V253, also Gaia20eys, had been identified as a short-period eclipsing novalike with Porb = 1.44 hr. Our spectrum shows shows broad emission lines consistent with this, and the extensive TESS data show a persistent modulation near 1.35 hr, evidently a negative superhump. It is less luminous than most novalikes, but significantly brighter than quiescent dwarf novae with comparably short periods. (v) Finally, DDE 45 shows a complicated variability history, cycling rapidly between high and low states for a time and more recently showing outbursts resembling a U Gem-type dwarf nova. We find a 2.07 hr radial velocity period, which also appears in archival TESS photometry. The emission lines are double-peaked, with an orbital S-wave similar to low-inclination dwarf novae.

Current empirical evidence indicates that M dwarfs with spectral types ranging from M3 / M4 to late-type M dwarfs, stellar masses smaller than 0.15 M$_\\odot$, and rotational period shorter than four days display either a stable dipolar magnetic field or magnetic structures with significant time variability. The magnetic activity of fully convective M dwarfs is known to be regulated by a mechanism named the ${\\alpha}^2$ dynamo. To further constrain the physics of this mechanism, we use a low-dimensional model for thermally driven magnetoconvection producing an ${\\alpha}^2$ dynamo, specifically a modified magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shell model. Although the model neglects density stratification, it captures the essential nonlinear dynamics of an $\\alpha^2$ dynamo. Therefore, the results should be interpreted in a qualitative sense, highlighting possible trends rather than providing direct quantitative predictions for fully convective stars. The model is validated by comparing the statistical properties of magnetic polarity reversals with paleomagnetic data, since the geodynamo provides the only natural ${\\alpha}^2$ dynamo with sufficiently rich reversal statistics. Our findings reveal that increased convective heat transport correlates with more frequent magnetic-polarity reversals, resulting in enhanced magnetic variability. This suggests that the observed magnetic dichotomy in late M dwarfs could be interpreted in terms of differences in global heat transport efficiency. However, additional models and observations of M dwarfs are needed to further constrain this interpretation.",

Transport Properties of Locally and Non-locally driven Convection Youhei Masada, Tomoya Takiwaki, Nobumitsu Yoko 11 pages, 12 figures, submitted to MNRAS Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn) We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of two idealized regimes of stellar convection: a cooling-driven model (Model C) and an entropy-gradient-driven model (Model S). The two regimes exhibit striking contrasts: while Model S develops large, relatively stationary eddies excited at depth, Model C is dominated near the surface by intermittent plume-like downflows that produce broad non-Gaussian velocity distributions and a turbulent energy flux that exceeds Model S by nearly an order of magnitude in the upper convection zone. Conventional gradient-diffusion (GD) closures reproduce the transport in Model S but significantly underestimate it in Model C, demonstrating that plume-driven convection lies beyond the scope of local, gradient-based models. To address this, we introduce a Time-Space Double Averaging (TSDA) method that extracts coherent fluctuations, yielding a diagnostic variable $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{u}}$ that peaks where the flux is largest. Building on this insight, we propose a modified GD closure in which the turbulent diffusivity is corrected by a plume-mediated term, achieving quantitative agreement with simulation results. Although the closure requires a calibrated model parameter and a careful choice of the averaging window, it provides a physically transparent framework that links coherent plume dynamics to mean-field transport, and offers a pathway toward improved subgrid models for non-equilibrium stellar convection zones.",

HXR images of specific energy ranges often contain overlapping contributions of these components, complicating their interpretation. This is even more challenging as HXR imagers generally use an indirect imaging system. Our work aims to separately image individual spectral components, such as thermal loops, superhot sources, and nonthermal footpoint sources, rather than obtaining images of specific energy ranges that show a combination of all components. We introduce a new method called spectral component imaging and apply it to observations provided by the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) aboard Solar Orbiter. First, the flare integrated HXR spectrum is fitted with individual spectral components to get the relative contributions of each component in each native STIX energy channel. In a second step, a set of linear equations is created based on these weights and the observed, energy-dependent STIX visibilities. The visibilities of the individual spectral components are derived by means of a linear least-squares approach and are subsequently utilized for image reconstructions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of spectral component imaging on four different flares observed by STIX. This method provides powerful diagnostics, particularly for flares with hot and superhot components, allowing us to spatially separate these two thermal components. We apply our methodology to the nonthermal peak of the X7.1 flare SOL2024-10-01, and we find that the superhot component is located 4.8 Mm away from the hot thermal loops. The thermal energy of the superhot component is approximately 20% of the energy content of the hot component, highlighting the significance of superhot components in the total flare energy budget.",

The basic mechanism by which solar prominences acquire these common structures during their evolution, however, remains an unresolved question. For the first time, our three-dimensional magneto-frictional simulation, driven by supergranular motions, self-consistently replicates the commonly observed multi-arch bridge morphology and its characteristic structures of solar quiescent prominences in a magnetic flux rope. In comparison with traditional views, our simulations demonstrate that the spine, feet, and voids (bubbles) are inherent prominence structures spontaneously forming as the flux rope evolves to a mature state. The voids mainly consist of legs of sheared magnetic loops caused by unbalanced supergranular flows, and prominence feet settle at the bottom of helical field lines piled up from the photosphere to the spine. Similarities between the simulated prominences and observed real prominences by the Chinese H$\\alpha$ Solar Explorer, the New Vacuum Solar Telescope, and NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory suggest the high validity of our model. This work corroborates the pivotal role of photospheric supergranulation as a helicity injection source in the formation and shaping of quiescent prominence structures within the solar atmosphere, thereby paving a new avenue for future investigations into their fine dynamics and stability.",

Baldner Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We report a point spread function (PSF) and deconvolution procedure to remove stray light from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) data. Pre-launch calibration observations, post-launch Venus transit and lunar transit data were used to develop the PSF and evaluate how well it reproduced the observed scattering. The PSF reported differs from previous stray light removal efforts since we do not use Gaussians as the central mathematical component. Instead, we use a Lorenztian convolved with an Airy function. In 2018, the HMI team began providing full-disk, stray-light-corrected data daily. Intensity, Doppler, magnetogram, and vector magnetic field data are provided. The deconvolution uses a Richardson-Lucy algorithm and takes less than one second per full-disk image. The results, on average, show decreases in umbral continuum intensity, a doubling of the granulation intensity contrast, increases in the total field strength, most notably in plage by $\\sim$1.4--2.5 the original value, and a partial correction for the convective blueshift. Local helioseismology analyses using corrected data yield results that are consistent with those from uncorrected data, with only negligible differences, except in sunspot regions. The new data are found in JSOC with names similar to the original but with the qualifying term '$\\_dcon$' or '$\\_dconS$' appended, denoting whether the deconvolution was applied to the filtergrams or Stokes images. The HMI team recommends using the corrected data for improved visual clarity, more accurate irradiance reconstruction, better co-alignment with high-resolution data, reduced errors in tracking algorithms, and improved magnetic field strengths.",

We study the velocity field in a special case of an active region with two mature sunspots, where one of them formed several days later than the main one. Between the two spots, flux emergence is still ongoing influencing the velocity pattern. We observed the active region NOAA 12146 on August 24, 2014, with the GREGOR Fabry-Pérot Interferometer (GFPI) and the Blue Imaging Channel (BIC) of the GREGOR solar telescope at Observatorio del Teide on Tenerife. Context data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) complement the high-resolution data. In the penumbra of a newly formed spot, we observe opposite Doppler velocity streams of up to +-2 km/s very close to each other. These velocities extend beyond the outer penumbral boundary and cross also the polarity-inversion line. The properties of the magnetic field do not change significantly between these two streams. Although the magnetic field is almost horizontal, we do not detect large transversal velocities in horizontal flow maps obtained with the local correlation technique. The ongoing emergence of magnetic flux in an active region causes flows of opposite directions intruding the penumbra of a pre-existing sunspot.",

These frequency shifts ($\\delta\\nu$) were determined using a cross-correlation method and using the individual mode frequencies, obtained by fitting power spectra. Three stars were found to exhibit $\\delta\\nu$ larger than their associated errors ($\\sigma_{\\delta\\nu}$) using both methods, while two more stars exhibited $\\delta\\nu>\\sigma_{\\delta\\nu}$ when the cross correlation was used and a further two stars exhibited $\\delta\\nu>\\sigma_{\\delta\\nu}$ when the fitted frequencies were used. When considering the whole sample of 20 stars, the amplitude of $\\delta\\nu$ showed no dependence on the large frequency separation and metallicity. However, $\\delta\\nu$ was observed to increase with rotation rate and effective temperature. Our sample contained a number of evolved subgiant stars, allowing us to expand the parameter space usually considered when comparing $\\delta\\nu$ with stellar parameters. While $\\delta\\nu$ was small for all of the evolved stars, one was found to have $\\delta\\nu>\\sigma_{\\delta\\nu}$, raising the possibility that these evolved stars may still exhibit variable magnetic activity.",

      "abstract": "Statistical analysis of eclipsing binaries with monotonic orbital-period variations: A-type W UMa contact systems Shinjirou Kouzuma 22 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in New Astronomy Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) On the basis of monotonic orbital-period variations, this study aims to identify genuine relationships between binary parameters and the rates of mass transfer (MT), mass loss (ML), and angular momentum loss (AML). Sample binaries with monotonic period variations are collected from the literature, together with well-determined binary parameters. Assuming the monotonic variations are responsible for any one of the MT, ML, and AML, their rates are calculated with the rates of change of period. After selecting crucial parameters using partial least-squares analysis, a parameter that exhibits the closest correlation with any one of the derived rates is further selected using partial regression plots. Moreover, power-law relationships are found for the discovered correlations. The properties of the sample binaries are also investigated by examining associations between binary parameters. In the systems with negative period variations, it is found that the rate of MT from more- to less-massive stars is a function of the primary radius; the AML rate is a function of the fill-out factor. In addition, the relationships between the mass ratio and stellar masses indicate that the ML rate relative to the MT rate decreases with increasing mass ratio below ~0.46. Meanwhile, in the systems with positive variations, it is found that the rate of MT from less- to more-massive stars is a function of the luminosity ratio and/or mass ratio; the ML rate is a function of the secondary temperature. The discussion also addresses possible processes occurring in the sample binaries.",

We present and analyse the detailed physical properties of six binary stellar systems, originally proposed as possible star-black hole binaries on the basis of radial velocities from Gaia's third data release, but soon recognised as likely post-mass-transfer binary systems with stripped companions. Methods. We used multi-epoch high-resolution FEROS spectra and spectral disentangling paired with stellar templates to derive effective temperatures, $T_\\mathrm{eff}$; stellar radii, R*; and projected rotational velocities, v$\\sin{i}$ for both components in all systems along with the mass ratio, q = $M_\\mathrm{accretor}/M_\\mathrm{donor}$ and the components' flux ratio as a function of wavelength. Results. Our analysis directly confirms that all systems are post-mass-transfer binaries with two luminous stars, i.e. no black hole companions. Each system contains an A-type accretor component that is rapidly rotating and a cooler very low-mass donor (~ 0.25M$\\odot$) that is overluminous. Five of the systems show no trace of any emission lines, implying that there is no current mass transfer, consistent with our inferred radii, in all cases within the Roche volume. The data are generally consistent with stable case AB mass transfer with $\\beta$ (the fraction of mass lost from the accretor) less than 0.7. While the accretor components rotate rapidly, they rotate well below the critical rotation rate, $v_\\mathrm{crit}$, even though there must have been enough mass transfer to spin them up to a significant fraction of $v_\\mathrm{crit}$, according to theoretical models of angular momentum transfer. As neither magnetic braking nor tidal synchronisation should have been effective in spinning down the stars, our results suggest that either mass accretion does not increase the angular momentum of the accretors to their critical values or the systems never reached these values in the first place.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) M dwarfs are magnetically active stars that frequently produce flares, which have implications for both stellar evolution and exoplanet studies. Flare occurrence rates and activity levels of M dwarfs correlate with stellar characteristics such as age, mass, and rotation period. We search TESS observations of a known active population of M dwarfs as well as a volume-limited sample of M dwarfs within 15 parsecs. We detect flares in the light curves of these stars, including 276 of 538 M dwarfs within 15 pc, and calculate cumulative flare frequency distributions (FFDs) for each star. Based on flaring behavior, we categorize stars into relatively higher and lower activity groups and fit power laws to their FFDs to compare the power law exponent ($\\alpha$) across activity levels. We find $\\alpha =1.99 \\pm 0.07$ for the combined FFD of the lower activity M dwarfs, compared to averages of $\\alpha = 1.94 \\pm 0.58$ for highly active stars with 10-100 detected flares, and $\\alpha = 2.03 \\pm 0.43$ for those with > 100 detected flares, suggesting little evolution in the power law distribution of flares as M dwarfs transition from high to low activity states. The uncertainties for the active star groups reflect the standard deviation of $\\alpha$ values across individual stars within each subset. Because stellar flares and associated stellar activity complicate exoplanet observations, we also examine the subset of M dwarfs with JWST transmission spectroscopy follow-up observations in Cycles 1-3. The flares we detect for these targets are consistent with the broader 15 pc sample, providing context for interpreting planetary atmosphere retrievals from JWST spectra.",

Gilbert, Judah Van Zandt, Erik A. Petigura, Luke B. Handley Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Giant planets and brown dwarfs are thought to form via a combination of pathways, including bottom-up mechanisms in which gas is accreted onto a solid core and top-down mechanisms in which gas collapses directly into a gravitationally-bound object. One can distinguish the prevalence of these mechanisms using host star metallicities. Bottom-up formation thrives in metal-rich environments, whereas top-down formation is weakly dependent on ambient metal content. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model and the results of the California Legacy Survey (CLS), a low-bias and homogeneously analyzed radial velocity survey, we find evidence for a transition in the stellar metallicity distribution at a companion mass of $\\gamma = 27_{-8}^{+12} \\, M_{\\rm Jup}$ for companions with orbital separations between $1-50$ au. Companions below and above this threshold tend to orbit stars with higher ($\\rm{[Fe/H]} = 0.17 \\pm 0.12$ dex) and lower ($\\rm{[Fe/H]} = -0.03 \\pm 0.10$ dex) metallicities, respectively. Previous studies of relatively close-in companions reported evidence of a lower transition mass of $\\leq 10 \\, {\\rm M_{\\rm Jup}}$. When applied to the CLS sample, our model predicts the probability of a transition in the stellar metallicity distribution at or below $10 \\, { M_{\\rm Jup}}$ to be $< 1 \\%$. We compare our results to estimates of $\\gamma$ gleaned from other observational metrics and discuss implications for planet formation theory.",

Howard, Luke B. Handley 10 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in the Astronomical Journal Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) To date, hundreds of sub-stellar objects with masses between $1-80\\ M_{\\rm Jup}$ have been detected orbiting main-sequence stars. The current convention uses the deuterium-burning limit, $M_c \\approx 13 M_{\\rm Jup}$ to divide this population between giant planets and brown dwarfs. However, this classification heuristic is largely divorced from any formation physics and may not accurately reflect the astrophysical nature of these objects. Previous work has suggested that a transition from ``planet-like'' to ``brown-dwarf-like'' characteristics occurs somewhere in the range $1-10 M_{\\rm Jup}$, but precise the crossover mass and whether the transition is gradual or abrupt remains unknown. Here, we explore how the occurrence rate, host star metallicity, and orbital eccentricities vary as a function of mass in a sample of 70 Doppler-detected sub-stellar objects ($0.8 < M_c/M_{\\rm Jup} < 80$) from the California Legacy Survey. Our population consists of objects near and beyond the water ice line ($1 < a / \\text{AU} < 10$), providing valuable clues to the details of giant planet formation physics at a location in the proto-stellar disk where planet formation efficiency is thought to be enhanced. We find that occurrence rate, host star metallicity, and orbital eccentricity all change gradually across the mass range under consideration, suggesting that ``bottom-up'' core accretion mechanisms and ``top-down'' gravitational instability mechanisms produce objects that overlap in mass. The observed eccentricity distributions could arise either from different formation channels or from post-formation dynamical interactions between massive sub-stellar objects.",

Currently, estimates of the power generated by SPMI primarily rely on analytical scaling laws that relate stellar and planetary parameters to the interaction energetics. The existing scaling laws published in the literature so far do not agree with each other by at least an order of magnitude. Our aim is to quantify an absolute upper limit on the power that a planet can channel back to its host star during such interactions, which in turn lead to the formation of stellar hotspots. By performing a series of 3D MHD simulations with varied parameters known to influence the energetics of SPMI, we derive a numerically supported scaling law that can be used to reliably estimate the energy channeled from the planet back to the star. Our results suggest that existing analytical scaling laws may not fully capture the power transferred from the planet to the star through SPMI. The scaling law derived from our numerical simulations appears to provide a more comprehensive estimate, reflecting dependencies on common stellar and planetary parameters also considered in earlier models. Moreover, our findings indicate that power generation involves not only the planetary obstacle itself but also the extended magnetic structure of the Alfven wings interacting with the streaming stellar wind. This study suggests that care should be taken when applying analogies directly from jovian sub-Alfvenic interactions to SPMI, as the underlying physical conditions (specifically the value of the Alfvenic Mach number) may not be directly comparable. Our numerically derived scaling law offers a potentially improved approach for estimating SPMI power, capturing some of the interaction's complexities exclusive to SPMI.",

Since systematics are often poorly understood and difficult to model, removing them directly and entirely may not be feasible. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method that aligns learned features between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples by optimizing a feature-alignment loss on the representations extracted from a pre-trained ID model. We first experimentally validate the method on the MNIST dataset using possible alignment losses, including mean squared error and optimal transport, and subsequently apply it to large-scale maps of neutral hydrogen. Our results show that optimal transport is particularly effective at aligning OOD features when parity between ID and OOD samples is unknown, even with limited data-mimicking real-world conditions in extracting information from large-scale surveys.

Submitted to PASP Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Ground-based astronomy suffers from strong atmospheric line- and thermal continuum emission, at the near infrared (NIR, 0.7-1.1$\\mu$m), and short-wave infrared (SWIR, 1.1-2.5$\\mu$m) wavelengths. The thermal continuum emission increases exponentially towards the red sensitivity cutoff of the state-of-the-art 2.5$\\mu$m cutoff SWIR detectors. Given availability of an optical quality shortpass filter material with strong blocking density in the SWIR, lower cost instrumentation, and higher performance filters could be designed. We demonstrate monopotassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP, chemical formula KH$_2$PO$_4$) as a strong candidate for this purpose. KDP is fully transparent at wavelengths from ultraviolet to 1.3$\\mu$m, but becomes highly opaque at wavelengths >2$\\mu$m. We demonstrate on-sky use of KDP by improving performance of a cryogenic broadband filter with known off-band thermal leak, and using a non-cryogenic narrow band filter for deep observation. KDP reduces the sky background by 4.5 magnitudes in the leaky Z-band filter we use. Our 4nm wide, central wavelength 1.191$\\mu$m narrowband filter in combination with KDP reduces the sky surface brightness by three magnitudes compared to a J broadband. We find a sky surface brightness of 18.5mag arcsec$^{-2}$ at 1.191$\\mu$m, and interpret it as the airglow continuum. KDP is an excellent thermal blocker, when its temperature is maintained above its Curie point at 123K. Below Curie point, KDP transforms its crystal structure, degrading its otherwise good imaging properties.",

      "abstract": "The X-$γ$ detector onboard the POEMMA-Balloon with Radio payload Matteo Battisti Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) is a NASA mission designed to study Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays and Very-High-Energy Neutrinos from a balloon platform. Serving as a precursor to the planned POEMMA satellite mission, PBR will be launched aboard a NASA Super Pressure Balloon for a flight at of 33 km altitude in Spring 2027 from Wanaka, New Zealand. The unique conditions of low pressure and high altitude will enable in-situ observations of High-Altitude Horizontal Air Showers (HAHAs), a poorly understood class of nearly horizontal Extensive Air Showers induced by cosmic rays skimming the Earth's atmosphere without reaching the ground. Due to the lower atmospheric grammage at these altitudes, HAHAs develop more gradually compared to typical downward-going EASs, with interaction lengths on the order of 100 km. This slow development allows balloon-borne instruments to probe the early stages of cosmic ray shower evolution. At these early stages, high-energy electrons and positrons from the electromagnetic component of the shower can generate X-rays and gamma rays via synchrotron radiation. The X-$\\gamma$ detector onboard PBR is designed to measure these photons across a broad energy range. The instrument consists of four sub-detectors, each optimized for different overlapping energy bandfrom tens of keV to MeV. The current design utilizes CsI(Tl)/NaI(Tl) scintillating crystals coupled with SiPMs for photon detection. To suppress background noise, the detectors are enclosed within an anti-coincidence system to reject charged particle events. The X-$\\gamma$ detector is aligned with PBR's primary instruments, the Fluorescence Camera and the Cherenkov Camera, within a 30$^\\circ$ field of view, overlapping with both imaging cameras. It will operate in a triggered mode, with the possibility to receive signals from the other instruments to check for simultaneous events.",

To be published in Advances in Space Research Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) In this work we investigate the potential of a thermal infrared (IR) space telescope to remotely characterize the component temperatures of a satellite. With the rapid increase in the number of objects launched in recent years, the ability to detect, track, identify and determine the intent of satellites has become of increasing importance. Spectral modeling of satellites from multi-wavelength photometry in the thermal IR is a technique that has the potential to derive information about the temperature and operational status of a satellite in orbit, without the requirement to spatially resolve the target. Previous work has focused on determination of a single/effective temperature for a Resident Space Objects (RSOs) - such as satellites, asteroids, debris and rocket bodies - from remote observations, obtaining mixed results in terms of ability to classify objects. To progress, we explore a two-greybody component spectral model. Using this analytical model, we investigate which temperature characteristics may be identified from unresolved multi-wavelength photometric observations as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio, under the assumption of Poisson noise-dominated data. With this instrument-agnostic framework, we then quantify the potential of this model to discriminate between RSOs with a single temperature (e.g. natural rocks) versus human-made satellites with a chassis and deployed solar panels where significant component temperature differences exist under typical orbital configurations. Last, we comment on promising prospects of this model for applications to existing and future space telescope observations to characterize RSOs from spatially unresolved photometry",

It is designed for polarization observations of transient sources in the soft X-ray energy range with a wide field of view (FOV). To validate the key technologies required for wide-FOV X-ray polarization measurements, the Cosmic X-ray Polarization Detector (CXPD) CubeSat was developed as a prototype for the LPD. The CXPD is equipped with two Gas Microchannel Plate Pixel Detectors (GMPDs) that measure X-ray polarization via the photoelectric effect, where ejected photoelectrons produce ionization tracks in the gas which are imaged to reconstruct their emission directions. Laboratory calibrations of the modulation factor and energy spectra were successfully performed using linear polarized X-ray sources at 2.98 keV, 4.51 keV, 6.40 keV, and 8.05 keV. Since its launch in June 2023, the CXPD has successfully completed critical in-orbit technology verification. It has also performed polarization observations of two bright X-ray sources Sco X-1 and the transient Swift J1727.8-1613 yielding constraints on their polarization degrees and angles. Notably, this was the first time that an anti-coincidence detector had been implemented in an X-ray polarimeter, enabling in-orbit verification of the charged-particle background rejection algorithm. These results demonstrate the feasibility of wide-field soft X-ray polarization measurements and provide essential guidance for the development of the LPD for the POLAR-2 mission, thereby advancing the frontier of X-ray polarization astronomy.",

Scaife Accepted to Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop, NeurIPS 2025 Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are most commonly optimised with first-order optimisers such as stochastic gradient descent. However, when optimising for parameters of probabilistic models, incorporating second order information during optimisation can lead to a more direct path in the distribution space and faster convergence. In this work we examine whether using natural gradient descent can improve the performance of variational inference based classification of radio galaxies. We use the Improved Variational Online Newton (iVON) algorithm and compare its performance against a recent benchmark for BNNs for radio galaxy classification. We find that iVON results in better uncertainty calibration out of all the methods previously considered while providing similar predictive performance to the best performing inference methods such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Bayes by Backprop based variational inference. Models trained with iVON can distinguish far out-of-distribution optical galaxy data, but they cannot reliably detect radio galaxy images from a telescope with different resolution and sensitivity. We find that the cold posterior effect persists in the models trained with iVON. Our results suggest that the choice of the optimiser can lead to qualitatively different solutions and future work using probabilistic neural network models should carefully consider the inductive biases being encoded through the optimisation process, in addition to the data, architecture and inference method.",

The Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) consists of four integral field units (IFU), each of which has three sub-channels. The twelve resulting spectral data cubes have different fields of view, spatial, and spectral resolutions. The wavelength range of each cube partially overlaps with the neighboring bands, and the overlap regions typically show flux mismatches which have to be corrected by spectral stitching methods. Stitching methods aim to produce a single data cube incorporating the data of the individual sub-channels, which requires matching the spatial resolution and the flux discrepancies. We present Haute Couture, a novel stitching algorithm which uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to perform a matrix completion, where the available MRS data cubes are treated as twelve sub-matrices of a larger incomplete matrix. Prior to matrix completion, we also introduce a novel pre-processing to homogenize the global intensities of the twelve cubes. Our pre-processing consists in jointly optimizing a set of global scale parameters that maximize the fit between the cubes where spectral overlap occurs. We apply our novel stitching method to JWST data obtained as part of the PDRs4All observing program of the Orion Bar, and produce a uniform cube reconstructed with the best spatial resolution over the full range of wavelengths.",

Fauchez Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The Functionality of Ice Line Latitudinal EBM Tenacity (FILLET) project is a CUISINES exoplanet model intercomparison project (exo-MIP) that compares various energy balance models (EBMs) through a series of numerical experiments. The objective is to establish rigorous protocols that enable the identification of intrinsic differences among EBMs that could lead to model-dependent results for past, current, and future EBM studies. Such efforts also provide the community with an EBM ensemble average and standard deviation, rather than a single model prediction, on benchmark cases typically used by EBM studies. These experiments include Earth-like planets at different obliquity, instellation, and carbon dioxide abundance. Here we update the v1.0 protocol (Deitrick et al., 2023) to accommodate the requirements of previously untested community models. In particular, we expand the range of carbon dioxide abundances for Experiment 4 to ensure any code will capture both snowball and ice-free end states. Additionally, participants are now required to report two ice edge latitudes per hemisphere to fully distinguish all climate states (snowball, ice caps, ice belts, and ice-free). The outputs described in FILLET protocol version 1.0 have also now been revised to include the maximum and minimum ice extent, in latitude, for each hemisphere, as well as the diffusion coefficient and outgoing longwave radiative flux.",

Although it was widely observed from the Northern Hemisphere, it was first discovered by observers south of the Equator. The comet arrived just months before the widely anticipated apparition of Comet 1P/Halley and was significantly more spectacular. As a result, the two comets were confused, and many who, in later years, talked about how prominent Comet 1P/Halley was in 1910 were often remembering C/1910 A1. In this paper, we present the results of a detailed search through historical records and media publications in Aotearoa / New Zealand, to investigate how extensively C/1910 A1 was observed from New Zealand. We compare our results with observations reported for Comet 1P/Halley later in 1910, finding that surprisingly few observations of C/1910 A1 were made by New Zealand observers. We discuss cases where the comet was misidentified as being an early sighting of 1P/Halley and compare the observations made in New Zealand with international observations/records/accounts. We find that, although the Great January Comet of 1910 was observed from New Zealand, it was witnessed by few compared to other parts of the world, meaning that the apparition of C/1910 A1 was something of a missed opportunity for New Zealand astronomers.",

On-wafer noise characterization of cryogenic low-noise transistors is desirable because it facilitates more rapid characterization of devices prior to packaging, but obtaining accurate noise measurements is difficult due to the uncertainty arising from the input loss and temperature gradients prior to the device-under-test (DUT). Here, we report a calibration method that enables the simultaneous determination of the backend noise temperature and effective-noise-ratio at the input plane of the DUT. The method is based on measuring the S-parameters and noise power of a series of attenuators at two or more distinct physical temperatures. We validate our method by measuring the noise temperature of InP HEMTs in 4-8 GHz. The calibration method can be generalized to measure the microwave noise temperature of any two-port device so long as a series of attenuators can be measured at two or more distinct physical temperatures.",

Two Python packages, TasVisAn and InsPy, have been developed to visualize and analyse data from TAS instruments - particularly from the cold-neutron TAS Sika and the thermal-neutron TAS Taipan at the Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering. TasVisAn offers a range of functions, including data importing, reduction, plotting, contour mapping, convolution fitting, and more, for data collected on TAS instruments, especially on Sika and Taipan. It also supports data reduction of the current trendy multi-analyser and multiplexing TAS instruments, including the multiplexing mode of Sika. Besides, it includes scan simulation and batch file validation tools for both Taipan and Sika, assisting users in designing and planning experiments in advance. InsPy is a general-purpose Python package designed to calculate the four-dimensional (4D) instrument resolution in momentum-energy space for any TAS instrument. Combined with InsPy, TasVisAn supports both instrument resolution calculation and resolution-convoluted data fitting. Its flexible external data import feature further allows TasVisAn to be adapted for the visualization and convolution analysis of inelastic neutron scattering data across various TAS instruments.",

Among its key observational modes, slitless spectral observation allows simultaneous imaging and spectral data acquisition over a wide field of view, offering significant advantages for astrophysical studies. Currently, the CSST is in the development phase and lacks real observational data. As a result, the development of its data processing pipeline and scientific pre-research must rely on the mock data generated through simulations. This work focuses on developing a simulation framework for the CSST slitless spectral imaging system, analyzing its spectral dispersing properties and structural design. Additionally, the detection performance of the slitless spectral system is assessed for various astrophysical targets. Simulation results demonstrate that nearly all 1st order spectra are accompanied by corresponding 0th order images, facilitating accurate source identification. Furthermore, the GI spectral band exhibits superior detection efficiency compared to the GV and GU bands, establishing it as the primary observational band for stellar and galactic studies. This work successfully develops a simulation framework for the CSST slitless spectroscopic equipment.",

Cowan, Gunnar Montseny Gens, Charles-Edouard Boukare, William Eaton, Karolina Sienko 6 pages, 6 figures; manuscript submitted to the Open Journal of Astrophysics Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Extreme instellation on lava planets causes the rocky surface to melt and vaporize. Because the rock vapour composition is intrinsically tied to the mantle, atmospheric characterization of lava planets can hold valuable insight into the interior processes of rocky planets. To help interpret current data and strategize for future observations, we develop the model SonicVapour to simulate the dynamics of chemically complex secondary atmosphere of lava planets. We find that for planets with surface temperatures exceeding 2700 K, the rock vapour outgassed is optically thick, making the atmosphere vertically isothermal thus suppressing convection and severely limiting atmospheric detection via emission spectroscopy. In contrast, cooler planets with surfaces between 2300 K - 2700 K have an atmospheric opacity close to 50% and produce distinct spectral features. Counter-intuitively, therefore, cooler lava planet atmospheres are easier to detect. Our results ultimately emphasize the importance of considering atmospheric \"detectability\" in tandem with signal-to-noise for future observation programs.",

This study investigates the particular case of HD7977's close encounter 2.47 Myr ago, which likely repopulated the Inner Oort Cloud and potentially triggered a significant comet shower on Earth. Our results demonstrate that the shower's intensity strongly depends on HD7977's impact parameter ($b$), with possible flyby distances ranging from 2,300 AU to $\\sim$ 13,000 AU. For the closest approach ($b \\sim 2,300$ AU), the terrestrial impact probability of 1 km comets increases by an order of magnitude compared to the steady state, slightly exceeding the asteroid impact probability at this size scale. We propose an analytical method to compute the probability of comet showers impacting Earth, which saves considerable computation time compared to N-body simulations. We identify a threshold diameter $D_0 = 2.25$ km for which yields $P = 1$ in our model, with $D_0$ following a logarithmic dependence on $b$. These findings suggest that HD7977's flyby may have caused an enhanced comet flux during the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition, which could plausibly be related to the environmental changes at this era.",

      "abstract": "Shaping the Mantle: The Role of Superheated Cores After Giant Impacts You Zhou 26 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables, and 5 supplementary figures Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The Moon-forming giant impact significantly influenced the initial thermal state of Earth's mantle by generating a global magma ocean, marking the onset of mantle evolution. Recent Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations indicate that such a collision would produce a superheated core, whose cooling would strongly influence subsequent mantle dynamics. Here, we present systematic SPH simulations of diverse giant-impact scenarios and show that the superheated core formed after the impact can trigger secondary mantle melting, thereby governing the final state of the magma ocean. To further quantify this effect, we employ a parameterized mantle-melting model to evaluate the influence of secondary melting on the lower mantle. Our results suggest three possible outcomes: complete mantle melting, the formation of a basal melt layer, or the initiation of an early superplume. Combined with recent two-phase magma-ocean solidification models, we infer that all three scenarios would result in basal melt layers of varying thickness, partially retaining the thermal energy of the superheated core. In the canonical Moon-forming scenario, the superheated core would rapidly transfer heat to Earth's lower mantle, causing secondary mantle melting within approximately 277--5983 years and generating either a basal melt layer or a fully molten mantle. Both outcomes would effectively erase primordial heterogeneities in the lower mantle and impose distinct pathways for its subsequent thermal evolution.",

Under review in Astronomy & Astrophysics. Version after first referee report Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) WASP-80 b is an unusually low-density exoplanet in tension with the metal-rich composition expected for a planet of its mass. We aim to derive precise constraints on WASP-80 b's bulk metal mass fraction, atmospheric composition, and thermal structure. We conducted a suite of retrievals using three approaches: traditional interior-only, atmosphere-only, and joint interior-atmosphere retrievals. We coupled the open-source models GASTLI and petitRADTRANS, which describe planetary structure and thermal evolution, and atmospheric chemistry and clouds, respectively. Our retrievals combine mass and age with panchromatic spectra from JWST and HST in both transmission (0.5-4 $\\mu$m) and emission (1-12 $\\mu$m) as observational constraints. We identify two fiducial scenarios. In the first, WASP-80 b has an internal temperature consistent with its age in the absence of external heating sources, and its atmosphere is in chemical equilibrium, with an atmospheric metallicity M/H = 2.75$^{+0.88}_{-0.56}$x solar, a bulk metal mass fraction $Z_{planet}=0.12\\pm0.02$, and a core mass $M_{core}=3.49^{+3.49}_{-1.59} \\ M_{\\oplus}$. In the second scenario, WASP-80 b may be inflated by an additional heat source - possibly induced by magnetic fields - with an atmospheric metallicity M/H = 10.00$^{+8.20}_{-4.75}$x solar, $Z_{planet}=0.28\\pm0.11$, and $M_{core}=31.8^{+21.3}_{-17.5} \\ M_{\\oplus}$. The super-solar M/H and sub-solar C/O ratios in both scenarios suggest late pebble or planetesimal accretion, while additional heating is required to reconcile the data with the more massive core predicted by the core accretion paradigm. In general, joint retrievals are inherently affected by a degeneracy between atmospheric chemistry and internal structure. Together with flexible cloud treatment and an unweighted likelihood, this leads to larger uncertainties in bulk and atmospheric compositions than previously claimed.",

The well-known Fermi's 1950s challenge, \"Where are the aliens?\" has acquired more substance with the realisation of the potentialities of radioastronomy, which led to the paradigmatic Drake's equation. The emergence of astrobiology, together with the discovery up to now of more than seven thousand exoplanets, has brought increasing support to the discussion about putative life cradles. However, after more than six decades, the only quantitative tool available to estimate how widespread is life and, in particular, advanced forms of life, is, besides direct searches, which so far provided no evidence, still Drake's equation. In the present work we review the current knowledge about this equation and present new arguments of multiple origin in order to evaluate one of its most critical terms, namely the one associated to the time span that a technological civilisation must search for detectable signs of the existence and for how long a search must be extended to bear fruits. We propose that this term should be replaced by a more specific one which involves critical parameters in the enterprise of gathering information, such as energy expenditure, searching area and entropy generation. These terms can be regarded as the capability that any cosmic civilisation must show in order to face the challenge of going beyond the climate and other crises that its development inevitably ensues. Our considerations suggest that a typical time span is about a couple of decades, meaning that a successful and systematic searching programme around about hundred stars might take around a few thousand years.",

Pierrehumbert Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Atmospheric convection behaves differently in hydrogen-rich atmospheres compared to higher mean molecular weight atmospheres due to compositional gradients of tracers. Previous 1D studies predict that when a condensible tracer exceeds a critical mixing ratio in H$_2$-rich atmospheres, convection is inhibited leading to the formation of radiative layers where the temperature decreases faster with height than in convective profiles. We use 3D convection-resolving simulations to test whether convection is inhibited in H$_2$-rich atmospheres when the tracer mixing ratio exceeds the critical threshold, while including processes neglected in 1D, e.g. turbulent mixing and evaporation. We run two sets of simulations. First, we perform simulations initialized on saturated isothermal states and find that compositional gradients can destabilize isothermal atmospheres. Second, we perform simulations initialized on adiabatic profiles which show distinct, stable inhibition layers form when the condensable tracer exceeds the critical threshold. Within the inhibition layer, only a small amount of energy is carried by latent heat flux, and turbulent mixing transports a small amount of tracer upwards, but both are generally too weak to sustain substantial tracer or heat transport. The thermal profile gradually relaxes to a steep radiative state, but radiative relaxation timescales are long. Our results suggest stable layers driven by condensation-induced convective inhibition form in H$_2$-rich atmospheres, including those of sub-Neptune exoplanets.",

Grimm 28 pages, 17 figures, under review, revised version including numerical corrections after first referee report Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The nature of sub-Neptunes remains unknown due to degeneracies in interior structure solutions. However, a statistical set of small planets with measured masses and radii can be used to test the planet formation theory prediction of large water reservoirs on sub-Neptunes. Here, we investigate whether water is included in photoevaporative mass loss and how much can partition into the rocky and metallic interior. We couple the result of a planetary formation model to evolution models which assume perfect mixing of water with H/He in the envelope or a layered structure. For the mixed envelopes, we also include fractionation during photoevaporative mass-loss. Further, the effect of equilibrium dissolution of water into an assumed magma ocean and into the metallic core is studied for the first time in coupled formation-evolution models. Out of the four tested scenarios, the mass-radius relation of exoplanets is relatively well matched by all scenarios except the one with layered H/He above water. The agreement depends on mass, with better consistency for the model without dissolution below 3 Earth masses and hints of the opposite at higher masses. In contrast to the significant effect of water dissolution, fractionation is not found to alter the properties of the planets for our initial conditions due to initially massive envelopes on all planets. For all scenarios, we quantify the radius valley location and scaling with stellar mass and conclude that water-rich sub-Neptunes mass-radius relations are broadly consistent with observations. Statistical surveys in mass and radius are required for distinction of the scenarios. The dissolution of different volatiles into the planetary interior and solidification of the magma ocean are natural next steps toward a comprehensive treatment of atmosphere-interior interaction in planet evolution models.

Raymond Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) A bombardment of comets is thought to have occurred in the inner solar system as a result of a dynamical instability among the giant planets after gas disk dispersal. Vesta, the second largest asteroid in the main asteroid belt, likely differentiated before gas disk dispersal, implying its crust witnessed the cometary bombardment. The composition of HED meteorites, which represent fragments of Vesta's crust, could therefore have been altered by cometary impacts. Here we combine noble gas mass spectrometry measurements, N-body simulations, collision rate calculations, and impact simulations to estimate the cometary contribution to Vesta. While our dynamical simulations indicate that Vesta likely underwent a significant number of collisions with large comets, we find no xenon cometary signature in HED meteorites. This apparent contradiction arises due to the fact that cometary impacts were at high speeds and Vesta's weak gravitational attraction made it incapable of retaining cometary material. Smaller asteroids are even less likely to retain such material. Therefore, if a cometary xenon signature is ever detected in an asteroid belt object, it must have been acquired during formation, within the same source region as comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and have been implanted later into the asteroid belt.",

The presence of minor planetary bodies in the outer solar system and the exo-Kuiper belts provide key constraints to planet formation models. In this work, we connected dust drift and coagulation, planetesimal formation, N-body gravity, pebble accretion, planet migration, planetary core accretion, gap opening, and internal photoevaporation in one modeling framework. We demonstrate that multiple classes of minor planets, or planetesimals, can form during disk dissipation and remain afterwards, including a scattered group, a resonant group, and a dynamically cold group. Significant growth by pebble accretion was prevented by both dynamical heating due to the giant planet in the system and rapid dispersal of the disk toward the end of its lifetime. We also conducted a parameter study which showed that this is not a universal case, where the outcome is determined by the competition for dust between planetesimal formation and pebble accretion. Combining this scenario with sequential planet formation, this model provides a promising pathway toward an outer solar system formation model.",

Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Far fewer gas giants have been caught in their accretion phase than mature ones are known. Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) instruments will have a higher sensitivity and a smaller inner working angle than instruments up to now, which should allow more productive searches and detailed characterisation. We study the observability of accreting gas giants with METIS, the first-generation ELT spectrograph. We focus on the accretion-tracing hydrogen recombination lines accessible at a resolution R=1e5, mainly Brackett alpha and Pfund-series lines. Our approach is general but we take as a fiducial case. To calculate high-resolution line profiles, we combine a semianalytical multidimensional description of the flow onto an accreting planet and its circumplanetary disc (CPD) with local non-equilibrium shock-emission models. We assume the limiting scenario of no extinction appropriate for gas giants in gaps and negligible contribution from magnetospheric accretion columns. We use simulated detector sensitivities to compute required observing times. Both the planet surface and the CPD surface shocks contribute to the total line profile, which is non-Gaussian and much narrower than the free-fall velocity. For the adopted baseline accretion rate onto the Bra line peak is equal to the photospheric continuum modulated mostly by water features. However, the rotation of the planet broadens the features, helping the shock excess stand out. At Br a, already the continuum of should yield SNR=12 in 4 h. The peak excess should require only about 15 min to reach SNR=3. Br a is a potent planet formation tracer accessible to METIS in little integration time. Resolved line profiles will place independent constraints especially on the mass and radius of an accreting planet, and help identify the accretion mechanism(s) at work.",

Sozzetti, S. Benatti, S. Colombo, R. Cosentino Accepted by MNRAS on 2025 November 13 Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) TOI-1422 is a G2 V star ($V = 10.6$ mag) known to host a warm Neptune-sized planet, TOI-1422 b, with a mass and radius of about $9M_{\\oplus}$ and $4R_{\\oplus}$, on a circular orbit with a period of $12.997$ days. An outer planetary candidate in this system had previously been suggested on the basis of a residual signal in the radial velocity (RV) data with a tentative period of $\\sim$29 days, along with a possible single transit-like event, although it was not clear at the time whether the two signals belonged to the same companion. In this work, we confirm the presence of a second transiting planet, TOI-1422 c, a sub-Neptune ($R=2.61\\pm0.14 R_{\\oplus}$) that orbits with a longer period of 34.563 days. This confirmation is based on the detection of three TESS transits, two from newly available sectors, combined with new and archival RV measurements. The sub-Neptune ($\\rho_{\\rm c}=4.3^{+1.3}_{-1.0}$ g cm$^{-3}$) is more massive than the inner Neptune ($\\rho_{\\rm b}=0.93^{+0.21}_{-0.20}$ g cm$^{-3}$), having a mass of $M_{\\rm c}=14\\pm3 M_{\\oplus}$, making TOI-1422 a rare anti-ordered system. Furthermore, we detect transit timing variations (TTVs) on the inner planet, with amplitudes of up to 5 hours, suggesting ongoing dynamical interactions. A dynamical analysis that combined TTVs and RVs indicates that planet c alone is unlikely to account for the full TTV amplitude observed on TOI-1422 b. We investigated whether an additional, as yet undetected companion could account for the observed signal, exploring a range of plausible orbital configurations and finding that a low-mass planet located between the two known orbits may be responsible.",
