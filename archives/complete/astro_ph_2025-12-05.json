In this work, we explore how the time evolution of the cosmological background, inferred from cosmic chronometer measurements of the Hubble parameter, can be used to reconstruct the relevant EFT functions. Our approach enables the direct determination of these EFT functions from observational data without assuming any specific cosmological model. This makes it possible to test the background evolution of a wide range of dark energy models, including the $\\Lambda$CDM model. We further demonstrate how the reconstructed EFT functions can be applied to constrain concrete theories, such as the quintessence model.",

Based on the t-SNE output, we apply Agglomerative Clustering in combination with the Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of groups. We then track these groups over time and investigate correlations between their occurrence and environmental or instrumental conditions.

Two representative magnetic field configurations, radial orientation dominated (RO) and transverse orientation dominated (TO), are implemented with strength and decay prescriptions. We found that both anisotropy and magnetic fields increase the maximum supported mass and modify the tidal deformability $\\Lambda$, thereby imprinting measurable signatures on GW signals. For the equal mass binary ($1.2M_\\odot$-$1.2M_\\odot$), anisotropy neutron star with RO magnetic field yield more compact stars and a larger shift in $\\Lambda$, allowing discrimination at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) as low as $\\sim18$ using the O4 power spectra density.

Sriramkumar Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) [Abridged] The primary gravitational waves (PGWs) are generated in the early universe from the quantum vacuum during inflation. In slow roll inflation, the power spectrum (PS) of PGWs over large scales, which leave the Hubble radius during inflation, is nearly scale-invariant. However, over very small scales, which never leave the Hubble radius, the PS of PGWs behaves as k^2, where k denotes the wave number. We examine the PS of PGWs at such high wave numbers or frequencies when the PGWs are evolved post-inflation, through the epochs of radiation and matter domination. Firstly, we argue that the PS has to be regularized in order to truncate the unphysical k^2 rise at high frequencies. Assuming instantaneous transitions from inflation to the epochs of radiation and matter domination, we carry out the method of adiabatic regularization to arrive at the PS of PGWs over a wide range of frequencies. We show that the process of regularization truncates the k^2 rise and the PS of PGWs oscillates with a fixed amplitude about a vanishing mean value over small scales or, equivalently, at high frequencies. Secondly, we smooth the transition from inflation to radiation domination (to be precise, we smooth the 'effective potential' governing the equation of motion of PGWs) and examine the impact of the smoothing on the regularized PS of PGWs. With the help of a linear smoothing function, we explicitly show that the smoother transition leads to a power-law suppression in the amplitude of the oscillations (about the zero mean value) of the regularized PS of PGWs over small scales that never leave the Hubble radius during inflation. Our analysis indicates that, when transitions are involved, regularization as well as smooth transitions seem essential to ensure that the correlation functions of the PGWs in real space are well behaved. We discuss the directions in which our results need to be extended.",

Without assuming a specific inflationary scenario we focus on the evolution of pGWs after they re-enter the horizon during a cosmological epoch characterized by the presence of shear viscosity. We show that shear viscosity introduces an additional damping term in the tensor equation, modifying both the transfer function and the energy density power spectrum. For a constant shear viscosity-to-Hubble ratio the transfer function acquires an extra red tilt, while a time-dependent viscosity leads to a running spectral index $\\Omega_\\text{GW}\\sim k^{n_\\text{eff}(k)}$ controlled by the time evolution of the mean free path of the viscous fluid. Our analysis provides a general framework to analytically quantify how shear viscosity can alter the primordial gravitational wave background in standard and non-standard post-inflationary scenarios. As a case study we evaluate the effect of viscosity of the electron-photon-baryon plasma, on both the transfer function and the normalized energy density, finding a $k$-dependent blue tilt due to gravitational wave freeze-out from the viscous phase. This effect corresponds to a fractional difference of order $10^{-3}$.",

In the context of the decade-long $H_0$ tension, the significant discrepancy between early- and late-Universe measurements of $H_0$ implies that fixing its value or imposing an external prior could bias the baryon census. To address this concern, we construct a late-Universe probe framework that unifies fast radio bursts (FRBs) and gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens, which can respectively resolve the missing baryon problem and the $H_0$ tension through their dispersion measures and absolute luminosity distances. By combining $104$ localized FRBs with $47$ GW events, we obtain an $H_0$-free measurement of $\\Omega_{\\rm b}=0.0488\\pm0.0064$ ($1\\sigma$), in concordance with early-Universe observations of CMB + BBN.

Submitted to PRL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas, merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets. Here we report on a numerical simulation that covers the late inspiral, merger, and initial postmerger phase of such a system where both black holes have the same mass and spin, and both spin axes are parallel to the orbital angular momentum. The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau. Such a distinct lightcurve should aid efforts to identify supermassive black hole mergers, with or without accompanying gravitational wave detections.",

Standard theories use the local Fokker-Planck (FP) equation, restricted to Gaussian processes under the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). We argue this is inadequate for RR. We demonstrate that gravitational interactions inherently produce infinite variance in stochastic torques, violating the CLT. Consequently, RR is governed by the Generalized Central Limit Theorem (GCLT) and constitutes a superdiffusive Lévy flight. We apply the space-fractional Fokker-Planck equation (FFPE), utilizing non-local operators, to explore resolutions to observational discrepancies. In transient regimes, the FFPE predicts immediate, linear flux ($\\Gamma(t) \\propto t$), consistent with high Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) rates in post-starburst galaxies, whereas local FP models predict significant exponential delay. Furthermore, we demonstrate analytically that non-local integral operators permit ``barrier jumping,'' bypassing bottlenecks like the Schwarzschild Barrier (SB), which local models interpret as severely suppressing Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspiral (EMRI) rates. We present proof-of-concept $N$-body simulations that confirm non-local RR transport, although the resolution must be improved to rule out enhanced Two-Body Relaxation in the small-N setup. The fractional framework offers a compelling alternative description for non-local transport, potentially resolving TDE and EMRI rate questions.",

Recent GMVA observations of M 87 at event horizon scales revealed a ring-like structure which is 50% larger at 86 GHz than the ring observed by the Event Horizon Telescope at 230 GHz. Aims. In this paper, we study a possible origin of the increased ring size at 86 GHz. We specifically aim to study the role the nonthermal electron population plays in the observed event horizon scales. Methods. We carry out 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations followed by radiative transfer calculations. We incorporate into the latter synchrotron emission from both thermal and nonthermal electrons. To better compare our results to observations, we generate synthetic interferometric data adjusted to the properties of the observing arrays. We fit geometrical models to this data in Fourier space through Bayesian analysis to monitor the variable ring size and width over the simulated time span of years. Results. We find that the 86 GHz ring is always larger than the 230 GHz ring, which can be explained by the increased synchrotron self-absorption at 86 GHz and the mixed emission from both the accretion disk and the jet footpoints, as well as flux arcs ejected from a magnetized disk. We find agreement with the observations, particularly within the error range of the observational value of M/D for M 87. Conclusions. We show that state-of-the art 3D GRMHD simulations combined with thermal and nonthermal emitting particles can explain the observed frequency-dependent ring size in M 87. Importantly we found that MAD events triggered in the accretion disk can significantly increase the lower frequency ring sizes.",

However, unquantified observational and selection biases can result in systematic errors in attempts to recover the intrinsic MZR, particularly at higher redshifts. We characterize the MZR at z~3-6 within a fully Bayesian framework using JWST NIRSpec spectra of 193 galaxies from the RUBIES survey. We forward model the observed mass-metallicity surface using prospector-generated spectra to account for two selection biases: the survey selection function and success in observing high signal-to-noise emission lines. We demonstrate that the RUBIES selection function, based on F444W magnitude and F150W-F444W color, has a negligible effect on our measured MZR. A correct treatment of the non-Gaussian metallicity uncertainties from strong-line calibrations lowers the derived MZR normalization by 0.2 dex and flattens the slope by ~20%; forward-modeling the effect of emission line observability steepens the slope by ~15%. Both of these biases must be taken into account in order to properly measure the intrinsic MZR. This novel forward modeling process motivates careful consideration of selection functions in future surveys, and paves the way for robust, high-redshift chemical enrichment studies that trace the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation across cosmic time.",

      "abstract": "Cosmology after Phantom Crossing by Horndeski Gravity Eric V. Linder Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) One possible way to explain the observed effective dark energy equation of state crossing $w=-1$ (the phantom divide) is through modified gravity. A key point is to not view the expansion history in isolation but to take into account the other gravitational impacts on growth of large scale structure, lensing, etc. Within shift symmetric Horndeski gravity this implies three main paths for the late time cosmic expansion. All require unusual kinetic structure and we analyze their various implications for how $w$ should behave after phantom crossing.",

      "abstract": "Richard Watkins, Hume A. Feldman Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We analyze the origin of the large scale bulk flow using the CosmicFlows 4 (CF4) peculiar velocity catalog. We decompose the observed motions into internal components, generated by mass fluctuations within 200Mpc/h, and external ones arising from structures beyond this volume. A weighted average technique is developed to test the model's self consistency while minimizing the impact of non Gaussian distance errors. The CF4 velocities show excellent agreement with the predicted internal field, yielding beta = 0.31 pm 0.01. We also determine that the value of the Hubble constant that should be used for calculating peculiar velocities from the CF4 to be H0 = 75.9 pm 0.1 km/s/ Mpc, consistent with CF4 calibrations. Using the minimum variance formalism, we further separate the bulk flow into its internal and external contributions and find that the observed large scale bulk flow is dominated by sources beyond 200Mpc/h. The amplitude of this externally driven flow increases monotonically with scale, consistent with the influence of a distant, massive overdensity. These findings reinforce the reliability of the CF4 velocity field while calling into question the assumption of a spatially uniform flow generated by external sources. Our results challenge the commonly made assumption that the flow in our local volume due to external mass concentrations can be modeled as being spatially uniform.",

      "abstract": "New Method for Investigating the Presence of Extragalactic Magnetic Fields Boris Stern, Igor Tkachev Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The extragalactic magnetic field could be detected by searching for signatures of the electromagnetic cascade initiated by high-energy photons on the intergalactic radiation and deflected by the field. This process produces a time delay and an extended gamma-ray halo around the source, which are looked for. We propose a new signature of electromagnetic echoes: the asymmetry of the gamma-ray distribution around blazars. As a measure of asymmetry, we use the offset of the gamma-ray distribution to the location of the blazar. This offset is due to the tilt of the jet of the blazar relative to the line of sight. Using a subsample of the 10 brightest BL Lacs, we exclude the range of extragalactic magnetic fields from $10^{-16}$ to $10^{-14}$ G, assuming that these objects have maintained a constant average luminosity over hundreds of thousands of years.",

Data will be released upon paper acceptance by journal Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Measurements of peculiar velocities in the local Universe are a powerful tool to study the nature of dark energy at low ($z < 0.1$) redshifts. Here we present the largest single set of $z<0.1$ peculiar velocity measurements to date, obtained using the Fundamental Plane (FP) of galaxies in the first data release (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We describe the photometric and spectroscopic selection criteria used to define the sample, as well as extensive quality control checks on the photometry and velocity dispersion measurements. Additionally, we perform detailed systematics checks for the many analysis parameters in our pipeline. Our DESI DR1 catalogue contains FP-based distances and peculiar velocities for $98,292$ unique early-type galaxies, increasing the total number of $z < 0.1$ FP distances ever measured by a factor of $\\sim2$. We achieve a precision of $26\\%$ random error in our distance measurements which is comparable to previous surveys. A series of companion DESI papers use the distances and peculiar velocities presented in this paper to measure cosmological parameters.",

The rotational velocities of 10,262 galaxies are measured at 0.4 R26 by comparing the redshifts at 0.4 R26 with those at the galaxy centers of spatially- resolved galaxies targeted as part of the DESI Peculiar Velocity Survey. The DESI DR1 TFR slope is calibrated by separating the spiral galaxies into redshift bins of width dz = 0.005 from 0.03 < z < 0.1 and jointly fitting the TFR across all bins. We find a slope of -7.22+/-0.01 AB mag in the r-band for the TFR, with an intrinsic scatter of 0.466+/-0.001 AB mag. We present a catalog of the distances and peculiar velocities to these 10,262 galaxies using our calibrated TFR. For cosmological analyses, we also present a clustering catalog and associated random catalogs using a subset of 6807 of the DESI DR1 TF galaxies.",

Our mock catalogs reproduce the Bright Galaxy Survey number density and clustering at low redshift $(z<0.1)$ and the DESI PV samples of Fundamental plane and Tully-Fisher distances, from which we derive peculiar velocities. We carefully match mock and data properties and we mimic measurements of distance indicators and peculiar velocities, which follow the same statistical properties as real data. Mock samples of type-Ia supernovae also complement the other two distance indicators. Our 675 available mock realizations were used consistently by our three different methodologies described in our companion papers that measure the growth rate of structure $f\\sigma_8$ with DESI PV DR1. Those mocks allow us to perform precise tests of clustering models and uncertainty estimation to an unprecedented level of accuracy, and compute correlations between methodologies. The consensus value for the DESI DR1 PV growth rate measurement is $f\\sigma_8 = 0.450 \\pm 0.055$. This sample of mock catalogs represents the largest and most realistic set for cosmological measurements with peculiar velocities to date.",

Comments are welcome. Code available at this https URL Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present the constraint on the growth rate of structure from the combination of DESI DR1 BGS sample, Fundamental Plane, and Tully-Fisher peculiar velocity catalogues using the maximum likelihood fields method. The combined catalogue contains 415,523 galaxy redshifts and 76,616 peculiar velocity measurements. To handle the large amount of data in the DESI DR1 peculiar velocity catalogue, we significantly improve the computational efficiency by rewriting the algorithm with JAX. After removing outliers and Tully-Fisher galaxies that are affected by systematics, we find $f\\sigma_8 = 0.483_{-0.043}^{+0.080}(\\mathrm{stat}) \\pm 0.018(\\mathrm{sys})$, consistent within $1\\sigma$ with the power spectrum and correlation function analysis using the same dataset. Combining all three measurements with appropriate correlations, the consensus measurement is $f\\sigma_8 (z_{\\mathrm{eff}}=0.07) = 0.450\\pm0.055$, consistent with Planck $+\\Lambda$CDM cosmology $(f\\sigma_8 = 0.449 \\pm 0.008)$. Combining with the high redshift growth rate of structure measurements from DESI ShapeFit, the constraint on the growth index is $\\gamma = 0.58\\pm0.11$, consistent with GR.",

Zou Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Joint analysis of the local peculiar velocity and galaxy density fields offers a promising route to testing cosmological models of gravity. We present a measurement of the normalised growth rate of structure, $f\\sigma_8$, from the two-point correlations of velocity and density tracers from the DESI DR1 Peculiar Velocity and Bright Galaxy Surveys, the largest catalogues of their kind assembled to date. We fit the two-point correlation measurements with non-linear correlation function models, constructed from density and momentum power spectra generated using 1-loop Eulerian perturbation theory, and validate our methodology using representative mock catalogues. We find $f\\sigma_8 = 0.391^{+0.080}_{-0.081}$, consistent to within $1\\sigma$ with accompanying analyses of the same datasets using power spectrum and maximum-likelihood fields methods. Combining these growth rate results from different methods including appropriate correlations, we find a consensus determination $f\\sigma_8(z = 0.07) = 0.4497 \\pm 0.0548$, consistent with predictions from \\textit{Planck}$+\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Jointly fitting to this consensus low-redshift growth rate and the DESI DR1 full-shape clustering dataset, we measure gravitational growth index $\\gamma_{\\rm L} = 0.580^{+0.110}_{-0.110}$, consistent with the prediction of general relativity.",

In Astronomy & Astrophysics Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The large-scale structure of the Universe and its evolution encapsulate a wealth of cosmological information. A powerful means of unlocking this knowledge lies in measuring the auto-power spectrum and/or the cross-power spectrum of the galaxy density and momentum fields, followed by the estimation of cosmological parameters based on these spectrum measurements. In this study, we generalize the cross-power spectrum model to accommodate scenarios where the density and momentum fields are derived from distinct galaxy surveys. The growth rate of the large-scale structures of the Universe, commonly represented as $f\\sigma_8$, is extracted by jointly fitting the monopole and quadrupole moments of the auto-density power spectrum, the monopole of the auto-momentum power spectrum, and the dipole of the cross-power spectrum. Our estimators, theoretical models and parameter-fitting framework have been tested using mocks, confirming their robustness and accuracy in retrieving the fiducial growth rate from simulation. These techniques are then applied to analyze the power spectrum of the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey and Peculiar Velocity Survey, and the fit result of the growth rate is $f\\sigma_8=0.440^{+0.080}_{-0.096}$ at effective redshift $z_{\\rm eff}=0.07$. By synthesizing the fitting outcomes from correlation functions, maximum likelihood estimation and power spectrum, yields a consensus value of $f\\sigma_8(z_{\\rm eff}=0.07) = 0.450 ^{+0.055}_{-0.055}$, and correspondingly we obtain $\\gamma=0.580^{+0.110}_{-0.110}$, $\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}=0.301^{+0.011}_{-0.011}$ and $\\sigma_8=0.834^{+0.032}_{-0.032}$. The measured $f\\sigma_8$ and $\\gamma$ are consistent with the prediction of the $\\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter Model and General Relativity.",

To be submitted to ApJ Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) in its first Data Release (DR1) already provides more than 100,000 galaxies with relative distance measurements. The primary purpose of this paper is to perform the calibration of the zero-point for the DESI Fundamental Plane and Tully-Fisher relations, which allows us to measure the Hubble constant, $H_0$. This sample has a lower statistical uncertainty than any previously used to measure $H_0$, and we investigate the systematic uncertainties in absolute calibration that could limit the accuracy of that measurement. We improve upon the DESI Early Data Release Fundamental Plane $H_0$ measurement by a) using a group catalog to increase the number of calibrator galaxies and b) investigating alternative calibrators in the nearby universe. Our baseline measurement calibrates to the SH0ES/Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, and finds $H_0=73.7\\pm 0.06\\;(\\text{stat.})\\pm 1.1\\;(\\text{syst.})$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Calibrating to surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distances yields a similar $H_0$. We explore measurements using other calibrators, but these are currently less precise since the overlap with DESI peculiar velocity tracers is much smaller. In future data releases with an even larger peculiar velocity sample, we plan to calibrate directly to Cepheids and the tip of the red giant branch, which will enable the uncertainty to decrease towards a percent-level measurement of $H_0$. This will provide an alternative to supernovae as the Hubble flow sample for $H_0$ measurements.",

      "abstract": "Forecasts for lifetime and fraction of Decaying Dark Matter based on redshift distortions from Euclid and BOSS Javier Juárez-Jiménez, Ana A. Avilez-López Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) In this work we forecast constraints on models of decaying dark matter (DCDM) by using redshift-space-distortion (RSD) measurements implemented in a Fisher information matrix. In particular, we focus on the fraction of unstable dark matter, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{dcdm}}$ respect to the ordinary CDM component, and the decay rate, $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{dcdm}}$ as the key parameters of the model. Fiducial values are derived from a MontePython MCMC analysis. The derivatives of the growth-related observable, $f\\sigma_8(z)$ with respect to the parameters are numerically around the fiducial model. For the Fisher analysis, we employ mock data designed for upcoming surveys, particularly Euclid and BOSS, where RSD measurements yield constraints on $f\\sigma_8.$ Our results show that when both stable and unstable components are allowed, constrains on the DCDM lifetime remain weak, with $\\tau_{\\mathrm{dcdm}}>1.18$ Gyr. In the limiting case of fully unstable dark matter ($\\alpha_{\\mathrm{dcdm}}=1$), the uncertainty improves to $\\tau_{\\mathrm{dcdm}}>235.89$ Gyr. Our findings highlight the potential of RSD probes in testing and complementing decaying dark matter scenarios.",

While the wave-like nature of ULDM has been widely studied in the literature, we explore another distinctive feature of ULDM as Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) in this paper: the emergence of vortices in a rotating BEC-ULDM halos. Using numerical solution of the GPP equation, we demonstrate that a lattice of vortices ,underdensity columns that carry angular momentum, naturally forms in a ULDM halo under conditions similar to those of the Milky Way. Furthermore, we study the gravitational lensing by these vortices as a possible observational signature of BEC-ULDM. If the vortices are large enough and the halo's rotational axis align with the line of sight, regularly separated brightness anomalies can be produced, providing strong evidence for BEC-ULDM.",

      "abstract": "Conformal Holographic Dark Energy Mario A. Rodríguez-Meza, Jorge L. Cervantes-Cota, Tonatiuh Matos Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Recent results from the DESI collaboration suggest a preference for an evolving dark energy (DE) component rather than a cosmological constant, motivating the exploration of alternative models for the background expansion. These data also reveal tension in the inferred matter density parameter -lower in DESI and higher in Planck- as well as a neutrino mass posterior that approaches the lower bounds permitted by oscillation experiments. In this work, we propose and test a conformal holographic DE (CHDE) model in which the DE density depends on a power law of the conformal time, characterized by an exponent (n). This formulation introduces a single additional parameter relative to LambdaCDM and reduces to it in the limit n = 0. We confront the CHDE model with BAO, CMB, and supernova datasets, following the same combinations used by DESI, and perform parameter inference under both flat and non-flat cosmologies. Our analyses show that LambdaCDM is not favored as the best-fit model when using CMB data alone or in joint analyses including BAO and SNla, and it is disfavored at the 4.4 sigma level for non-flat model and 4.5 sigma for the flat model. We obtain consistent values of n= -0.28 to -0.32 with uncertainties less than +-0.1 across multiple data combinations. Similar to LambdaCDM, the CHDE model predicts a lower matter density when employing DESI data instead of Planck data. This, in turn, influences the neutrino mass constraints, yielding values close to the minimal allowed range. Despite these dataset-dependent tensions, both the flat and curved CHDE models remain compatible with neutrino mass constraints from terrestrial experiments and yield posterior distributions that peaks at positive values. This behavior avoids the issue encountered in the LambdaCDM model, where the posterior peaks at negative mass values.",

Pessi, Ting-Wan Chen Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) provide the most robust means of measuring extragalactic distances. While most of the effort has focused on increasing the number of SNe Ia observed in the optical, near-infrared (NIR) observations remain scarce despite their advantages, that is, reduced dust extinction and a more intrinsic standard candle behavior, requiring little to no empirical corrections. Here, we present ASNOS (ANDICAM-SOFI Near-infrared and Optical type Ia Supernova), a dataset with sample size of 1,482 epochs in the $BVRIYJH$ filters from the ANDICAM instrument on the 1.3-meter SMARTS telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, along with 125 $JHK$ epochs from the SOFI instrument on the 3.58-meter New Technology Telescope on the La Silla Observatory. Additionally, we incorporate optical forced photometry from the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The sample comprises 41 SNe Ia in total, including 29 normal events, eight 1991T-like objects, and four peculiar subtypes, all located at redshifts $z < 0.085$. This paper provides a detailed overview of the ASNOS sample selection, data reduction, SN photometry, host-galaxy spectral energy distribution construction, both global and local, and SN light-curve fitting using three methods: SALT3-NIR, SNooPy, and BayeSN. A companion paper will present the cosmological analysis.",

These maps are affected by relativistic redshift-space distortions (RSDs), which become increasingly relevant on ultra-large scales. Accurate modelling of these relativistic RSDs is essential to avoid systematic biases in key cosmological measurements, such as primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG). To address this, we introduce an updated implementation of the LIGER method, LIGER4GAL, which incorporates all linear-order relativistic RSDs directly at the tracer level of high-resolution N-body simulations. We demonstrate that LIGER4GAL improves upon previous iterations of the LIGER method by reproducing the expected non-linear clustering while maintaining accuracy for relativistic RSDs on large scales. We use the updated code to generate a DESI-like sample of luminous red galaxies from the Huge MultiDark Planck simulation. By measuring the power spectrum multipoles of this sample with and without the imprint of relativistic RSDs, we assess the impact of relativistic effects on measurements of the local PNG signal ($f_\\mathrm{nl}$). We find that the omission of the''finger-of-the-observer'' (sourced by the peculiar velocity of the observer) effect in the power spectrum modelling can bias measurements of $f_{\\rm nl}$ by more than $1$ ($0.25$) $ \\sigma_{f_{\\rm nl}}$ in 40% (80%) of the possible realizations of the universe if scales down to $k_\\mathrm{min} = 0.0015\\,h/\\mathrm{Mpc}$ are included.",

      "abstract": "On distance and velocity estimation in cosmology Adi Nusser Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Scatter in distance indicators introduces two conceptually distinct systematic biases when reconstructing peculiar velocity fields from redshifts and distances. The first is distance Malmquist bias (dMB) that affects individual distance estimates and can in principle be approximately corrected. The second is velocity Malmquist bias (vMB) that arises when constructing continuous velocity fields from scattered distance measurements: random scatter places galaxies at noisy spatial positions, introducing spurious velocity gradients that persist even when distances are corrected for dMB. Considering the Tully-Fisher relation as a concrete example, both inverse and forward formulations yield unbiased individual peculiar velocities for galaxies with the same true distance (the forward relation requires a selection-dependent correction), but neither eliminates vMB when galaxies are placed at their inferred distances. We develop a modified Wiener filter that properly encodes correlations between directly observed distance $d$ and true distance $r$ through the conditional probability $P(r|d)$, accounting for the distribution of true distances sampled by galaxies at observed distance $d$. Nonetheless, this modified filter yields suppressed amplitude estimates. Since machine learning autoencoders converge to the Wiener filter for Gaussian fields, they are unlikely to significantly improve velocity field estimation. We therefore argue that optimal reconstruction places galaxies at their observed redshifts rather than inferred distances; an approach effective when distance errors exceed $\\sigma_v/H_0$, a condition satisfied for most galaxies in typical surveys beyond the nearby volume.",

Comments are welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Mock galaxy catalogues are often constructed from dark-matter-only simulations based on the galaxy-halo connection. Although modern mocks can reproduce galaxy clustering to some extent, the absence of baryons affects the spatial and kinematic distributions of galaxies in ways that remain insufficiently quantified. We compare the positions and velocities of satellite galaxies in the MTNG hydrodynamic simulation with those in its dark-matter-only counterpart, assessing how baryonic effects influence galaxy clustering and contrasting them with the impact of galaxy selection, i.e. the dependence of clustering on sample definition. Using merger trees from both runs, we track satellite subhaloes until they become centrals, allowing us to match systems even when their z=0 positions differ. We then compute positional and velocity offsets as functions of halo mass and distance from the halo centre, and use these to construct a subhalo catalogue from the dark-matter-only simulation that reproduces the galaxy distribution in the hydrodynamic run. Satellites in the hydrodynamic simulation lie 3-4% closer to halo centres than in the dark-matter-only case, with an offset that is nearly constant with halo mass and increases toward smaller radii. Satellite velocities are also systematically higher in the dark-matter-only run. At scales of 0.1 Mpc/h, these spatial and kinematic differences produce 10-20% variations in clustering amplitude -corresponding to 1-3$\\sigma$ assuming DESI-like errors- though the impact decreases at larger scales. These baryonic effects are relevant for cosmological and lensing analyses and should be accounted for when building high-fidelity mocks. However, they remain smaller than the differences introduced by galaxy selection, which thus represents the dominant source of uncertainty when constructing mocks based on observable quantities.",

Wong, Lise Christensen, Veronica Motta, Alessandro Sonnenfeld Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Time-delay cosmography leverages strongly lensed quasars to measure the Universe's current expansion rate, H_0, independently from other methods. While the latest TDCOSMO results relied mainly on quadruply lensed quasars, doubly lensed systems are far more common and offer precise time delays, potentially enlarging the usable sample by a factor of five and enabling percent-level constraints on H_0. We present the first TDCOSMO analysis of a doubly imaged source, HE1104-1805, including the measurement of the four necessary ingredients. First, by combining 17 years of data from the SMARTS, Euler and WFI telescopes, we measure a time delay of 176.3\\pm 10.8 days. Second, using MUSE data, we extract stellar velocity dispersion measurements in three radial bins with up to 5% precision. Third, employing F160W HST imaging for lens modelling and marginalising over various modelling choices, we measure the Fermat potential difference between the images. Fourth, using wide-field imaging, we measure the convergence added by objects not included in the lens modelling. Hence, we measure the time delay distance and the angular diameter distance to the deflector, favouring a power-law mass model over a baryonic and dark matter composite model. The measurement was performed blindly and yielded H_0 = 64.2^{+5.8}_{-5.0} x $\\lambda_{int} km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}, where \\lambda_{int} is the internal mass sheet degeneracy parameter. This is in agreement with the TDCOSMO-2025 milestone and its precision for \\lambda_{int}=1 is comparable to that obtained with the best-observed quadruply lensed quasars (4-6%). This work is a stepping stone towards a precise measurement of H_0 using a large sample of doubly lensed quasars, supplementing the current sample. The next TDCOSMO milestone paper will include this system in its hierarchical analysis, constraining \\lambda_{int} and H_0 jointly with multiple lenses.",

When compared to Rockstar and Consistent Trees, our halo-finder tracks subhalos much longer and more consistently, produces halos with better constrained physical parameters, and returns a much denser halo mass function for halos with more than 100 particles. Our results also compare favorably to recently described specialized particle-tracking extensions to Rockstar. Haskap Pie is well-suited to a variety of studies of simulated galaxies and is particularly robust for a new generation of studies of merging and satellite galaxies.

Simulations predict that cold gas, the fuel for star formation, is channeled through filamentary structures into galaxies. Yet, direct observational evidence for this process has been limited by the challenge of mapping the cosmic web at small scales. Using miniJPAS spectro-photometric data combined with spectroscopic DESI redshifts when available, we construct a high-density observational galaxy sample spanning 0.2<z<0.8. Local filaments are detected within a 3 Mpc physical radius of each galaxy with stellar mass M* >10^(10) Msun using all nearby galaxies as tracers, combined with a probabilistic adaptation of the DisPerSE algorithm designed to overcome limitations due to photometric redshift uncertainties. Our methodology is tested and validated using mock catalogues built with random forest models applied to a simulated lightcone. Besides recovering the expected increase in galaxy connectivity (defined as the number of filaments attached to a galaxy) with stellar mass, we show that our connectivity measurements agree with 3D reference estimates from the mock galaxies. Thanks to these filament reconstructions, we explore the relation between small-scale connectivity and galaxy star formation rate, finding a mild positive trend which needs to be confirmed by follow up studies with larger sample sizes. We propose galaxy connectivity to local filaments as a powerful and physically motivated metric of environment, offering new insights into the role of cosmic structure in galaxy evolution.",

Cross-correlating high-redshift tracer samples with the CMB lensing potential offers a particularly robust probe of PNGs, mitigating imaging systematics that typically affect large-scale measurements from tracer auto-spectra. In this context, UNIONS enables the selection of $u$-dropout high-redshift Lyman-Break Galaxies (LBGs). We perform a MCMC-based forecast to estimate the uncertainties on $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc}$ and on a galaxy bias parameter, which captures our uncertainty in the tracer bias. From the angular cross-power spectrum between LBGs and Planck CMB lensing, we forecast $\\sigma(f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc})=34$ for an idealized photometric sample of $r<24.3$ LBGs selected with a Random Forest classification algorithm from UNIONS-like $ugriz$ imaging, with a resulting surface density of $1,100$ deg$^{-2}$. This precision can be improved to $\\sigma(f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc})=20$ after spectroscopic follow-up with DESI, during its next phase starting in 2029, DESI-II. We test a more realistic $u$-dropout LBG selection using early UNIONS data, which yields a denser sample of $r<24.2$ objects at $1,400$ deg$^{-2}$. From this sample, covering a larger footprint and expected to have a higher large-scale galaxy bias, we forecast $\\sigma(f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc})=20$, with similar precision achievable after DESI spectroscopic follow-up. In addition, we perform preliminary validation of the redshift distribution using the clustering-redshift method with DESI DR1 data, confirming the calibration from deep, small-area photometric fields. However, accounting for uncertainties in the clustering-redshift distribution significantly degrades the $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc}$ constraining power.",

González Hernández, Andrea Pastorello 28 pages, 19 Figures and 19 Tables (submitted to ApJ). Comments are welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We have applied our approach of using ''SNe Ia twins''in the Hubble flow to obtain distances to SNe Ia at z $>$ 0.015 and derive H$_{0}$. Our results, taking a single step between the low z domain and the Hubble flow, validate the three rung classical method. We find, however, that the full compilation of distances, both in Pantheon+ and in the Carnegie-Chicago Hubble Program (CCHP), contain some inaccurate values in the colors due to an underestimate of reddening by dust. This produces odd individual values for H$_{0}$ from single SNe Ia. On the average, those erroneous estimates do not affect the mean value of H$_{0}$, which is characterized by the bulk of well--modeled SNe Ia. Our sample of carefully addressed SNe Ia in the Hubble flow contains a dozen supernovae, for which the distances are determined with high accuracy. Three of these SNe Ia are of the Broad Line subtype and can be compared with SN 1989B in M66, a host galaxy with a unique convergence of the Cepheid distance determination and the Tip of the Red Giant Branch stars (TRGB) determination by the CCHP group. They point to a weighted average of H$_{0}$ $=$ 73.556 $\\pm$ 2.084 (stat) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc $^{-1}$. There is as well a very good agreement on the distances to NGC 7250 and NGC 5643 between those derived with Cepheids by SH0ES and those derived with the use of J-Asymptotic Giant Branch stars (JAGB stars) by the CCHP, which makes them very good anchors. The sample of 12 SNe Ia gives a value of H$_{0}$ $=$ 72.833 $\\pm$ 1.306(stat) $\\pm$ 1.151 (sys) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, when anchored in Cepheids, and of H$_{0}$ $=$ 72.388 $\\pm$ 1.272 (stat) $\\pm$ 1.015 (sys) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, when anchored in JAGBs by the CCHP. We take a mean of the two values of H$_{0}$ and obtain H$_{0}$ $=$ 72.610 $\\pm$ 1.289(stat) $\\pm$ 1.085 (sys) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.",

Archival maps from far-infrared and sub-millimeter surveys potentially contain the redshifted [CII]-158$\\mu$m, hidden in the much brighter continuum emission. We present a search for aggregate [CII]-158$\\mu$m line emission across the predicted peak of star formation history by tomographically stacking a high-completeness galaxy catalog on broadband deep maps of the COSMOS field and constraining residual excess emission after subtracting the continuum spectral energy distribution (SED). We obtain constraints on the sky-averaged [CII]-158$\\mu$m signal from the three Herschel/SPIRE maps: $11.8\\pm10.2$, $11.0\\pm8.7$, $9.6\\pm9.8$, and $9.2\\pm6.6$ $k$Jy/sr at redshifts $z\\sim 0.65$, $\\sim1.3$, $\\sim2.1$, and $\\sim2.6$ respectively, corresponding to $1-1.4\\sigma$ significance in each bin. Our $3\\sigma$ upper limits are in tension with past $z\\sim2.6$ results from cross-correlating SDSS-BOSS quasars with high-frequency Planck maps, and indicate a much less dramatic evolution ($\\sim\\times7.5$) of mean [CII] intensity across the peak of star formation history than collisional excitation models or frameworks calibrated to the tentative PlanckxBOSS measurement. We discuss this tension, particularly in the context of in-development surveys (TIM, EXCLAIM) that will map this [CII] at high redshift resolution. Having demonstrated stacking in broadband deep surveys as a complementary methodology to next-generation spectrometers for line intensity mapping, our novel methods can be extended to upcoming galaxy surveys such as Euclid, as well as to place upper limits on fainter atomic and molecular lines.",

Please check this https URL (and this https URL) for downloading the figures (and data products) from this cold gas catalog Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present the first results of V\\textit{z}-GAL, a high-redshift CO($J=1-0$) large survey with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, targeting 92 \\textit{Herschel}-selected, infrared-luminous, dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at redshifts 1 to 6. These sources are selected based on having redshifts and mid/high-\\textit{J} CO transitions from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array \\zgal survey. We successfully detect CO($J=1-0$) emission in 90/92 galaxies at the expected positions and redshifts, including 9 tentative detections at $2\\sigma - 3\\sigma$ significance, and CO($J=2-1$) emission in 10 of these galaxies. The CO($J=1-0$) luminosities suggest apparent gas masses in the range $\\mu {M}_{\\rm H_2}$ = $(2-20) \\times {10}^{11}~(\\alpha_{CO}/{4.0})~\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$, which implies gas depletion times of $(50-600)$~Myr. These timescales show similar spread as local ULIRGs, suggesting a self-regulatory mechanism that maintains a consistent SFR per unit gas mass in starbursts across redshifts. To quantify the contribution of ``excitation correction\" factors to gas mass estimates, we calculate median CO line brightness temperature ratios of $r_{21}=0.88\\pm0.25$, $r_{31}=0.61\\pm0.22$, $r_{41}=0.49\\pm0.15$, $r_{51}=0.47\\pm0.13$, and $r_{61}=0.28\\pm0.13$. Accounting for these corrections results in a reduced scatter in `gas mass--star formation rate' relations. We also find a median log(${L}^{\\prime}_{\\mathrm{[CI]}(^{3}P_1 - ^{3}P_0)}/{L}^{\\prime}_{\\mathrm{CO}(J=1-0)})=-0.71\\pm0.12$ for a subsample of 23 sources, consistent with the ratios derived for local star-forming galaxies. Together, our findings are in agreement with common conditions in the cold gas reservoirs among star-forming galaxies over a broad range in star formation modes, efficiencies, and scales.",

This study aims to fill this gap by investigating the relationship between SMBH mass at the galactic center and exoplanetary habitability, given that SMBH masses are empirically confirmed to span approximately 5 orders of magnitude in galaxies. Through simplified models, we account for various results involving the relationships between the distance from the planet to the central SMBH and the mass of the SMBH. Specifically, we show that increased SMBH mass leads to higher atmospheric heating and elevated temperatures, greater molecular thermal velocities, and enhanced mass loss, all of which diminish with distance from the galactic center. Energy-driven winds consistently have a stronger impact than momentum-driven ones. Crucially, ozone depletion is shown to rise with SMBH mass and decrease with distance from the galactic center, with nearly complete ozone loss ($\\sim100\\%$) occurring across galactic scales for SMBHs $\\geq 10^8 M_\\odot$ in the energy-driven case. This study emphasizes that SMBH growth over cosmic time may have produced markedly different impacts on galactic habitability, depending on both the mass of the central black hole (BH) and the location of planetary systems within their host galaxies.",

Rosen, Omnarayani Nayak, Sebastian Lopez, Tyler Holland-Ashford, Trinity L. Webb High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Observations of massive star-forming regions show that classical stellar wind models over-predict the luminosity of the X-ray emitting gas, indicating a significant fraction of wind energy is lost. In this paper, we present a multi-wavelength analysis of the giant HII region 30 Doradus and its central star cluster R136 using 2 Ms of Chandra X-ray Observatory data, combined with James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope imaging and Spitzer spectral-energy distributions, to investigate how the hot gas energy is lost through turbulent mixing, radiative cooling, and physical leakage. We compare the spatial and spectral properties of the hot gas with those of the warm ionized gas and dust. We find no significant correlation between the dust and hot gas temperatures, suggesting they are not directly coupled and that the dust resides in the swept-up shells where it is heated radiatively. H$\\alpha$ and X-ray surface brightness profiles show that the X-rays peak interior to the H$\\alpha$ shells, demonstrating partial confinement of the hot gas. The fragmented shell structure and bright X-ray interior that declines near the H$\\alpha$ shell reflect efficient cooling from turbulent mixing at the hot-cold interface. We compare against recent simulations of stellar-feedback driven bubbles which have broad agreement with the morphology of the X-ray and H$\\alpha$ emission, but the simulations produce a dip in the interior X-ray surface brightness and a lack of hard X-rays compared to the observations. These differences may suggest thermal conduction is important as mass-loading of the hot bubble could reproduce the X-ray observables.",

Pasham 10 pages, 1 figure, ApJL accepted High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Pa 30 -- the likely remnant of the Galactic type Iax supernova of 1181 AD -- displays an unusual, firework-like morphology, consisting of radial filaments extending from a common center, where a white dwarf (WD) currently drives a very fast wind (speed $\\gtrsim 10^{4}$ km s$^{-1}$). We propose the filaments arose from the Rayleigh-Taylor-unstable nature of the interface between the circumstellar medium (CSM) and the shocked wind launched by the natal WD; the filaments then elongated intact due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz-stable nature of the large initial density contrast between the wind and CSM, supplemented by the slowly declining wind density profile (relative to homologously expanding ejecta). To support this interpretation, we present two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations and derive the filament properties, including their speed, density, and temperature, all of which are consistent with observations. We suggest the filaments elongate until the wind and CSM densities become comparable at the contact discontinuity, which occurs within 1--10 years, and then truncate because the RTI halts. The subsequent KHI growth timescale across the current width of the filaments is longer than the age of Pa 30, so they remain intact. The filament-less central region in Pa 30 is therefore more likely a consequence of the finite timescale over which the RTI operates, rather than a wind termination shock. In general, firework-like filaments may form in other systems, provided there is a sufficiently large density contrast between the ejecta and its surroundings.",

Using the GALPROP code we explore how variations in the local gas and source distributions affect spectral features at low energies. Comparing with recent Voyager 1 data taken in the local ISM, we show that for a realistic interstellar gas distribution, the nearest source of the low energy CR particles observed nearby the Solar system is constrained to be within the range ~150-200 pc distant. We find that the modelling supports the conclusion of Cummings et al. (2025) that there is a significant fraction of primary Boron in its observed spectrum at low energies. Our study shows that detailed modelling of the immediate Galactic environment is required to robustly infer Galactic CR propagation parameters from local measurements, and that accounting for nearby ISM structure can alleviate tensions between direct CR data and global propagation models.",

Combined with archival Chandra observations of all other known quasars, they form nearly complete X-ray observations of all currently known $z\\sim7$ quasars with $M_{1450}<-26.5$, except for J0313$-$1806 at $z=7.642$ and J0910$-$0414 at $z=6.636$. Together with existing ground-based NIR spectroscopy and ALMA observations, we investigate the correlations between X-ray emission (the X-ray luminosity $L_{\\rm X}$ and the optical/UV-to-X-ray spectral slope $\\alpha_{\\rm OX}$) and various quasar properties (rest-UV luminosity $L_{\\mathrm{2500\\ \\mathring{A}}}$, bolometric luminosity $L_{\\rm bol}$, C IV blueshift, and infrared luminosity $L_{\\rm IR}$). We find most $z>6.5$ quasars follow a similar $\\alpha_{\\rm OX}-L_{\\mathrm{2500\\ \\mathring{A}}}$ relation as $z\\sim1-6$ quasars, but also display a large scatter. We find a potential correlation between $\\alpha_{\\rm OX}$ and the C IV blueshift, suggesting a soft optical/UV-to-X-ray SED shape is frequently associated with fast disk winds. Furthermore, we analyze the X-ray spectrum of 11 quasars at $z>6.5$ with Chandra detection, and find the best-fit photon index $\\Gamma$ is $2.41\\pm0.27$, which is likely driven by high accretion rates of $z>6.5$ quasars. In addition, we find there are no significant correlations between either $L_{\\rm X}$ and $L_{\\rm IR}$, nor $L_{\\rm bol}$ and $L_{\\rm IR}$, suggesting no strong correlations between quasar luminosity and star formation luminosity for the most luminous quasars at $z>6.5$.",

Numerical simulations have indicated that the initial strengths and configurations of the large-scale magnetic fields have a direct imprint on the outcome of an accretion disk evolution. To facilitate future self-consistent simulations that include intrinsic dynamo processes, we derive and implement a subgrid model of a helical large-scale dynamo with dynamical quenching in general-relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamical simulations of geometrically thin accretion disks. By incorporating previous numerical and analytical results of helical dynamos, our model features only one input parameter, the viscosity parameter $\\alpha_\\text{SS}$. We demonstrate that our model can reproduce butterfly diagrams seen in previous local and global simulations. With rather aggressive parameter choice of $\\alpha_\\text{SS}=0.02$ and black hole spin $a_\\text{BH}=0.9375$, our thin-disk model launches weak collimated polar outflows with Lorentz factor $\\simeq 1.2$, but no polar outflow is present with less vigorous turbulence or less positive $a_\\text{BH}$. With negative $a_\\text{BH}$, we find the field configurations to appear more similar to Newtonian cases, whereas for positive $a_\\text{BH}$, the poloidal field loops become distorted and the cycle period becomes sporadic or even disappears. Moreover, we demonstrate how $\\alpha_\\text{SS}$ can avoid to be prescribed and instead be determined by the local plasma beta. Such a fully dynamical subgrid dynamo allows for self-consistent amplification of the large-scale magnetic fields.",

By solving the governing hydrodynamic equations, we obtain global transonic NDAF solutions featuring shock transitions and examine their role in powering GRB energetics. The NDAF solutions are explored over a broad range of black hole parameters, including its mass ($M_{\\rm BH}$) and spin ($a_{\\rm k}$), and accretion rate ($\\dot{M}$). We find that shocked NDAFs can naturally account for the observed diversity in GRB energy output. Incorporating results from numerical simulations of binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star mergers, we estimate the remnant black hole mass and spin parameters for the predicted range of post-merger disk mass ($M_{\\rm disk}$). Our analysis reveals that small-mass black holes with relatively low spin values can adequately reproduce the luminosities of short GRBs (SGRBs), whereas identical GRB luminosities can also be achieved for more massive black holes possessing higher spin values. Finally, we uncover a robust correlation between the black hole spin and disk mass such that $M_{\\rm disk}$ decreases with increasing $a_{\\rm k}$, remaining largely independent of the black hole mass ($M_{\\rm BH}$) powering GRBs.",

Such a large CSM is difficult to explain in a single-degenerate scenario where the donor star is a helium star. Here we show that, under certain conditions, it is possible that the transfer of helium leads to a common envelope (CE) engulfing the system, similar to the common-envelope wind model proposed by Meng \\& Podsiadlowski (2017). If in such a helium common-envelope wind (HeCEW) model the initial white dwarf (WD) mass is larger than 1.1 $M_{\\rm \\odot}$ and the helium star more massive than 1.8 $M_{\\rm \\odot}$, the mass of a helium CE can be larger than 0.3 $M_{\\rm \\odot}$ prior to supernova explosion. The CE mass heavily depends on the initial parameters of the binary system. A dynamical CE ejection event could occur shortly before the supernova, and then our model may naturally explain the properties of SN 2020eyj, specifically the massive He-rich CSM, its dim peak brightness, low ejecta velocity and low birth rate.",

Turner, Yoshihiro Ueda, Satoshi Yamada, Sreeparna Ganguly, Paolo Somenzi 13 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present the initial high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic observations of the Fe-K absorption structure in the luminous nearby quasar PG 1211+143, utilizing the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM). The primary objective is to characterize the Fe-K absorption features due to Ultra-Fast Outflow (UFO) in this Eddington-luminosity source. Observations were conducted with XRISM's Resolve and Xtend instruments, complemented by simultaneous data from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. A historically bright phase was captured. The Resolve spectra clearly reveal a prominent P Cygni profile and resolves the Fe-K absorption into six distinct velocity components, ranging from $v = -0.074c$ to $-0.405c$. A similar superposition of multiple UFOs has been reported in PDS~456, suggesting that such a ``UFO forest'' structure may be a common feature of near Eddington-luminosity sources. Some UFO components exhibit narrow line widths of approximately $\\sigma \\sim 200\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$, which may indicate that the outflows have reached their terminal velocities, thereby resulting in a smaller velocity shear. The mass outflow rate is estimated to be $\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{out} \\sim 1~M_{\\odot}~\\text{yr}^{-1}$, which is of the order of the Eddington accretion rate. This suggests a physically plausible scenario where the outflow is a significant channel for mass ejection.",

Many FRBs exhibit multi-component structures, which encode information about their emission mechanisms or progenitor systems and thus provide important clues to their origins. In this work, we systematically analyze the burst morphology of FRB 20190520B and compare component distributions across four active FRBs observed with FAST: FRB 20121102A, FRB 20190520B, FRB 20201124A, and FRB 20240114A. We find that multi-component burst-clusters show spectral properties similar to single-peak bursts, and no periodicity is detected in their temporal behavior. The component-count distributions follow a power law, revealing scale-free behavior consistent with self-organized criticality (SOC) processes. Multi-component clusters account for 12-30% of all detected bursts, regardless of source activity, providing new insights into burst-to-burst variability and the physical processes driving FRB emission.",

Pastorello, M. Shahbandeh, G. Valerin 17 pages, 9 figures, several tables. Constructive comments are welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present early-time observations of the broad-lined Type Ic supernova SN 2020lao, including optical spectroscopy beginning about 48 hr after the inferred explosion and extending to about 100 days. The explosion epoch is constrained with power-law fits to the rising TESS and ZTF light curves, with the first ZTF detection only about 27 hr after explosion. The optical light curves show a rapid 8.8 day rise and a peak luminosity typical of SNe Ic-BL (Mr=-18.5 mag). Unlike some engine-driven events, SN 2020lao shows no early optical excess or afterglow. The lack of a shock-cooling signature in the TESS/ZTF data constrains the progenitor to a compact Wolf Rayet-like star with radius of only a few solar radii. The spectra resemble those of the X-ray flash SN 2006aj but with higher velocities. Arnett modeling of the bolometric light curve, combined with Fe II velocities, yields a nickel mass of about 0.2 solar masses, an ejecta mass of about 3.2 solar masses, and a kinetic energy of about 23x10^51 erg, corresponding to a high specific kinetic energy of about 7x10^51 erg per solar mass. Spectral-synthesis modeling broadly reproduces the photospheric spectra and suggests a somewhat lower but still large specific kinetic energy (about 5 x 10^51 erg per solar mass). Although SN 2020lao and SN 2006aj produced similar 56Ni masses, SN 2020lao exhibits specific kinetic energies larger by a factor of several. Published VLA and Swift/XRT non-detections show no radio or X-ray afterglow, placing strong limits on relativistic ejecta and dense circumstellar material. Given its high specific kinetic energy, the absence of early excess emission and the radio/X-ray non-detections imply that any jet was either far off-axis or choked; otherwise, SN 2020lao represents an extreme non-relativistic SN Ic-BL.",

We analyze the statistical properties of pre-maximum spectropolarimetric data for 24 SNe Ia observed with VLT/FORS, focusing on the Si II $\\lambda$6355 Åline. Previous studies have revealed a correlation between the peak Si II polarization degree and the expansion velocity. Here, we combine these observations with multi-dimensional non-LTE radiative transfer simulations. We consider two asphericity classes: (i) lopsided abundance distributions produced by off-center delayed-detonation transitions in near-$M_{Ch}$ white dwarfs or, for example, WD collisions (Class I), and (ii) global, axisymmetric density asphericities such as those arising from explosions of rapidly rotating WDs or mergers (Class II). Our model grid spans normal to subluminous SNe Ia and successfully reproduces the observed Si II velocity-polarization trend, with higher velocities associated with stronger asphericities. Consistent with observations, transitional SNe Ia and the faint end of the normal SNe Ia population show the highest Si II polarization and are best explained by Class I scenarios. In contrast, subluminous SNe Ia are dominated by Class II asphericities, characterized by lower Si II polarization but significant continuum polarization. The observed distribution of Si II polarization depends on both the observer's viewing angle $\\theta$ and the intrinsic asphericity. Statistical analysis of these spectropolarimetric snapshots enables the separation of Class I and Class II contributions and highlights the intrinsic diversity among SNe Ia. Our results imply viewing-angle-dependent luminosities in our local sample, which may have implications when using high-redshift SNe Ia as evidence for the need of non-standard cosmology.",

In this review, we explore the proposed continua that link hydrogen-rich Type II SNe to stripped-envelope explosions (IIb-Ib-Ic), and that extend further into interaction-dominated and superluminous events. We discuss the physical processes-stellar winds, binary interaction, eruptive outbursts, and circumstellar interaction-that may produce graded outcomes across classes, while highlighting where observational evidence supports or challenges smooth transitions. We propose that CCSNe are better viewed as a multidimensional continuum of explosion outcomes, where traditional subclasses act as reference points rather than strict boundaries.

These simulations, conducted with the moving-mesh code AREPO, aim to investigate the effects of chemical separation on the ejecta and spectra of such WDs undergoing thermonuclear explosions. The distillation process alters the internal chemical stratification of the star, concentrating neutron-rich material either in a central core or in an interior shell. We model both configurations as well as a homogeneous equivalent for each case with the same $^{22} \\mathrm{Ne}$ content distributed evenly at all radii. Despite similar $^{56} \\mathrm{Ni}$ yields between the core and shell models ($0.40$ and $0.45 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ respectively), the two models yield markedly different iron-group abundances. Both distilled models showed significantly enhanced production of $^{15} \\mathrm{N}$ via the decay of $^{15} \\mathrm{O}$. The $^{22} \\mathrm{Ne}$-core model produces enhanced amounts of stable neutron-rich iron-group isotopes such as $^{58} \\mathrm{Ni}$ and $^{54} \\mathrm{Fe}$. We highlight observational signatures associated with these differences, including potentially enhanced [$\\mathrm{Ni}_{\\rm II}$] lines in nebular spectra. Synthetic TARDIS spectra at early times show only moderate differences. Our results suggest that white dwarf distillation, a process linked to delayed cooling in the Gaia Q branch population, may leave detectable nucleosynthetic fingerprints in a subset of Type Ia supernovae.

Issue website: this https URL, paper link: this https URL. Supplementary data can be found via zenodo: this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Radio-loud high-redshift quasars (RHRQs) provide crucial insights into the evolution of relativistic jets and their connection to the growth of supermassive black holes. Beyond the extensively studied population at $z \\ge 5$, the cosmic morning epoch ($3 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 5$) marks the peak of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity and black hole accretion, yet remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we compiled the radio high-redshift quasar catalog (RHzQCat) by cross-matching the SDSS DR16Q catalog with four major radio surveys -- FIRST,NVSS, RACS, and GLEAM. Our tier-based cross-matching framework and visual validation ensured reliable source identification across surveys with diverse beam sizes. The catalog included 1629 reliable and 315 candidate RHRQs, with radio luminosities uniformly spanning $10^{25.5}$ -- $10^{29.3}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. About 95\\% of the confirmed sources exhibited compact morphologies, consistent with Doppler-boosted or young AGN populations at high redshifts. Our catalog increases the number of known RHRQs at $z\\ge3$ by an order of magnitude, representing the largest and most homogeneous catalog of radio quasars at cosmic morning, filling the observational gap between the early ($z>6$) and local Universe. It provides a robust reference for future statistical studies of jet evolution, AGN feedback, and cosmic magnetism with next-generation facilities such as the Square Kilometer Array (SKA).",

      "abstract": "Quasi-linear theory of perpendicular ion heating by critically balanced turbulence Zade Johnston, Jonathan Squire 55 pages, 24 figures. Submitted to Journal of Plasma Physics Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) In collisionless astrophysical plasmas, turbulence mediates the partitioning of free energy among cascade channels and its dissipation into ion and electron heat. The resulting ion heating is often anisotropic, with ions observed to be preferentially heated perpendicular to the local magnetic field; understanding the mechanisms responsible for this heating is a key step in understanding the evolution of such plasmas. In this paper, we use the framework of quasi-linear theory to compute analytically the heating rates of ions interacting with turbulent, large-scale Alfvénic fluctuations. We show how the imbalance of the turbulence (the difference in energies between Alfvénic fluctuations travelling parallel and antiparallel to the magnetic field) modifies the spatiotemporal spectrum of these fluctuations, allowing the heating mechanism to transition between two commonly-studied mechanisms: stochastic heating in balanced turbulence to resonant-cyclotron heating in imbalanced turbulence. The resultant heating rate is found to have a general form regardless of the level of imbalance, exhibiting a suppression related to the conservation of the ions' magnetic moment at small turbulent amplitudes and recovering previous empirical results in a formal calculation. The results of this work help to consolidate our qualitative understanding of ion heating within astrophysical plasmas, as well as yielding specific quantitative predictions to analyse simulations and observations.",

Accepted to ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present an analysis of the radio quiescent data from a multiwavelength campaign of the active M-dwarf flare star AU Mic (dM1e) that occurred in October 2018. Using Ku-band data (12 to 18 GHz) from the Very Large Array and K-band data (17 to 25 GHz) from the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we find that the quiescent spectrum can be decomposed into two components: one falling with frequency and one that remains flat. The flat component has a relatively steady flux density of 0.64 $\\pm$ 0.14 mJy. The falling component varies in strength, but exhibits a spectral index of $\\alpha$ = $-0.88 \\pm 0.10$. The falling component is thus consistent with nonthermal, optically thin gyrosynchrotron radiation with a corresponding power-law index similar to flares from AU Mic. While a flat component may arise from thermal, optically thin free-free emission, the observed flux density and inferred mass-loss rate are both too large compared to previous stellar wind and X-ray emission theory and models, necessitating an alternative explanation. This flat component instead matches well with an optically thick gyroresonance component integrated over multiple source regions such that the composite spectra are reasonably flat. The persistence of these components across the rotational period suggests multiple source regions, which may help explain changes in flux density and persistent high-energy electrons.",

I discuss some of the scientific motivations for new instrumentation and the major new projects that are in development or already under construction, together with emerging concepts for instrumentation in the farther future. I stress the strong complementarity of the ground-level particle detector arrays, with their wide-field capabilities, and the more precise Cherenkov telescope arrays. The key science topics for the next decades require both approaches and both are developing rapidly towards major performance advances and full sky coverage. I will briefly outline the status and roles of the projects CTAO and SWGO which will dominate the next decade. Beyond these projects are several developments which might boost performance at both ends of the ground-based gamma-ray energy range, including the plenoscope approach at low energies and diverse approaches to ultra-high-energy gamma-ray astronomy; from lake-based instruments to arrays of very small Cherenkov telescopes. I will again briefly review these activities and how they may contribute long term.",

Gravitational wave observations provide an suitable test case, using only 90 LIGO events, finetuned LLMs achieve 97.4\\% accuracy for identifying signals. Further experiments show that, in contrast to traditional networks that rely on large simulated datasets, additional simulated samples do not improve LLM performance, while scaling studies reveal predictable gains with increasing model size and dataset size. These results indicate that LLMs can extract discriminative structure directly from observational data and provide an efficient assessment for gravitational wave identification. The same strategy may extend to other astronomical domains with similar noise properties, such as radio or pulsar observations.",

Kaplan, Emil Lenc, Tara Murphy, Miguel Perez-Torres, Lauren Rhodes 22 pages, 7 figures; accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present the discovery of the radio afterglow of the most distant ultra-long gamma-ray burst (GRB) detected to date, GRB~220627A at redshift $z=3.084$. Its prompt gamma-ray light curve shows a double-pulse profile, with the pulses separated by a period of quiescence lasting ${\\sim} 15$\\,min, leading to early speculation it could be a strongly gravitationally lensed GRB. However, our analysis of the \\textit{Fermi}/GBM spectra taken during the time intervals of both pulses show clear differences in their spectral energy distributions, disfavouring the lensing scenario. We observed the radio afterglow from 7 to 456\\,d post-burst: an initial, steep decay ($F_{\\nu} \\propto t^{-2}$) is followed by a shallower decline ($F_{\\nu} \\propto t^{-1/2}$) after ${\\sim} 20$\\,d. There are three scenarios that could explain these radio properties: (i) energy injection from an additional, slower ejecta component catching up to the external shock; (ii) a stratified density profile going as $n \\propto r^{-8/3}$; or alternatively, (iii) the presence of a slow, wide ejecta component in addition to a fast, narrow ejecta component. We also conducted an independent test of the lensing hypothesis via Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations at ${\\sim} 12$\\,d post-burst by searching, for the first time, for multiple images of the candidate lensed GRB afterglow. Our experiment highlighted the growing need for developments in real-time correlation capabilities for time-critical VLBI experiments, particularly as we advance towards the SKA and ngVLA era of radio astronomy.",

González Hernández 19 pages, 10 figures, ApJ in press High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We study the possibility that Type Ia supernovae might be produced by binary systems where the companion of the exploding white dwarf is an M-dwarf star. Such companion would appear as a runaway star, retaining its pre-explosion orbital velocity along with a kick imparted by the supernova ejecta. It might be rapidly rotating, from being tidally locked with the white dwarf prior to explosion in a very close binary. For this study, we perform a series of multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the interaction between M-dwarf companions and SN ejecta, followed by post-impact stellar evolution modeling using the MESA code. Our initial models in the 3D simulations had high spin angular momenta and the effects of magnetic braking have been included. They very significantly reduce the final rotation. A surviving companion candidate, MV-G272, has recently been discovered in the supernova remnant G272.2-3.2, which is an 8.9$\\sigma$ proper motion outlier, although being slowly rotating. Our results show that the properties of this companion (luminosity, effective temperature, surface gravity) can be reproduced by our post-impact M-dwarf models. The slow rotation, which is a common characteristic with several proposed hypervelocity SN companions, can be explained by magnetic braking during the post-impact evolution, thus supporting the possibility that the MV-G272 star is the surviving companion of the Type Ia supernova now found as G272.2-3.2 SNR.",

Ashall, Thomas Lowe, Melissa Shahbandeh, Anna Payne Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Transient events associated with supermassive black holes provide rare opportunities to study accretion and the environments of supermassive black holes. We present a multiwavelength study of AT2020adpi (ZTF20acvfraq), a luminous optical/UV transient in the nucleus of the galaxy WISEA J231853.77$-$103505.6 ($z=0.26$) that exhibits the properties of an ambiguous nuclear transient. Near peak, its spectral energy distribution is well described by a power law ($\\lambda L_\\lambda \\propto \\lambda^{-\\alpha}$, $\\alpha = 0.44 \\pm 0.04$), with a maximum $g$-band luminosity of $(3.6 \\pm 0.6)\\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is consistent with luminous AGN flares. We detect a strong mid-infrared flare ($L_\\mathrm{peak}^{\\mathrm{MIR}} = (2.3 \\pm 0.05)\\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$) delayed by $\\sim$210 rest-frame days, indicating a hot dust echo from material at $\\sim$0.2 pc. The optical and near-infrared spectra show broad H, He I, [OIII] lines, as well as narrow Fe II, and prominent Mg II, which is a combination not typical of TDEs. Taken together, these features suggest AT2020adpi is an ambiguous nuclear transient, where an accretion episode was triggered by stellar disruption of an accretion disk or instabilities within an active nucleus. This source demonstrates the need for careful multiwavelength analysis to distinguish between extreme AGN variability and TDEs.",

Jones, Asaf Horowicz, Kaylee de Soto, Bingjie Wang, Ben Margalit 38 pages, 14 figures, 2 tables, accepted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present FrankenBlast, a customized and improved version of the Blast web application. FrankenBlast associates transients to their host galaxies, performs host photometry, and runs a innovative SED fitting code to constrain host stellar population properties--all within minutes per object. We test FrankenBlast on 14,432 supernovae (SNe), ~half of which are spectroscopically-classified, and are able to constrain host properties for 9262 events. When contrasting the host stellar masses ($M_*$), specific star formation rates (sSFR), and host dust extinction ($A_V$) between spectroscopically and photometrically-classified SNe Ia, Ib/c, II, and IIn, we determine that deviations in these distributions are primarily due to misclassified events contaminating the photometrically-classified sample. We further show that the higher redshifts of the photometrically-classified sample also force their $M_*$ and sSFR distributions to deviate from those of the spectroscopically-classified sample, as these properties are redshift-dependent. We compare host properties between spectroscopically-classified SN populations and determine if they primarily trace $M_*$ or SFR. We find that all SN populations seem to both depend on $M_*$ and SFR, with SNe II and IIn somewhat more SFR-dependent than SNe Ia and Ib/c, and SNe Ia more $M_*$-dependent than all other classes. We find the difference in the SNe Ib/c and II hosts the most intriguing and speculate that SNe Ib/c must be more dependent on higher $M_*$ and more evolved environments for the right conditions for progenitor formation.

Merger-novae are typically powered by the radioactive decay of heavy elements synthesized via the r-process. If the post-merger remnant is a long-lived rapid-rotating neutron star, the merger-nova can be significantly enhanced due to strong magnetized winds. In this paper, we generate mock BNS merger samples using binary population synthesis model and classify their post-merger remnants--black hole (BH) and magnetar, (i.e., long-lived supramassive NS and stable NS), based on results from numerical simulations. We then construct merger-nova radiation models to estimate their luminosity function. We find that the luminosity function may exhibit a distinctive triple-peak structure, with the relative positions and heights of these peaks depending on the equation of state (EOS) of the BNS. Furthermore, we estimate the average Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) detection efficiency $\\langle f_{\\rm eff} \\rangle$ with the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) and find that due to possible enhanced luminosity, the largest source redshift with $\\langle f_{\\rm eff} \\rangle>0.1$ can be enlarged from $z_{\\rm s}\\sim 0.5$ to $z_{\\rm s}\\sim 1-1.5$. Besides, we also generate the detectable mass spectrum for merger-novae by $\\langle f_{\\rm eff}\\rangle$, which may provide insights to the ToO searching strategy.",

Accepted to ApJ Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG) We present ORACLE, the first hierarchical deep-learning model for real-time, context-aware classification of transient and variable astrophysical phenomena. ORACLE is a recurrent neural network with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and has been trained using a custom hierarchical cross-entropy loss function to provide high-confidence classifications along an observationally-driven taxonomy with as little as a single photometric observation. Contextual information for each object, including host galaxy photometric redshift, offset, ellipticity and brightness, is concatenated to the light curve embedding and used to make a final prediction. Training on $\\sim$0.5M events from the Extended LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge, we achieve a top-level (Transient vs Variable) macro-averaged precision of 0.96 using only 1 day of photometric observations after the first detection in addition to contextual information, for each event; this increases to $>$0.99 once 64 days of the light curve has been obtained, and 0.83 at 1024 days after first detection for 19-way classification (including supernova sub-types, active galactic nuclei, variable stars, microlensing events, and kilonovae). We also compare ORACLE with other state-of-the-art classifiers and report comparable performance for the 19-way classification task, in addition to delivering accurate top-level classifications much earlier.

Revisions: Section 2 is substantially reorganized and partially rewritten, with an improved model. Moderate additions to sections 3 and 4 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We argue that the \"Little Red Dots\" (LRDs) discovered with the James Webb Space Telescope are quasi-stars in their late stages of evolution. Quasi-stars are hypothetical objects predicted to form following the core collapse of supermassive stars, and consist of black holes accreting from massive envelopes at a super-Eddington rate. We show that models of late-stage quasi-stars, with black hole masses exceeding $\\sim 10\\%$ of the total, predict thermal and radiative properties that are insensitive to both black hole and envelope mass, and spectrally resemble LRDs. Specifically, we show that they are likely to exhibit reddish colors, a strong Balmer break, and possess conditions favorable to the production of Balmer lines that are broadened by electron scattering. Their huge electron column densities suppress any X-rays. Late-stage quasi-stars, with black hole masses $\\gtrsim 10^6 M_\\odot$, should dominate the overall quasi-star population. Their short predicted lifetimes (tens of Myr), coupled with the high observed comoving density of LRDs, suggest that most or all supermassive black holes go through a quasi-star/LRD phase during their formation and growth.",

      "abstract": "A Critical Evaluation of the Physical Nature of the Little Red Dots Kohei Inayoshi, Luis C. Ho Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a newly identified class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) uncovered by JWST deep surveys. Their enigmatic properties challenge the canonical AGN paradigm and have stimulated ideas on early massive black hole (BH) formation. In this review, we summarize how early BHs shape the characteristic features of LRDs, how their nuclear environments differ from those of normal AGNs, and how future observations can distinguish between competing scenarios. Our main conclusions are as follows: (1) LRDs show broad-line emission consistent with mass accretion onto BHs with $M_{\\rm BH}\\simeq 10^{6-7}~M_\\odot$, suggesting that AGN activity is a plausible origin of their dominant red optical emission. (2) Stellar components can reproduce the continuum energetics through dusty star formation. However, the required stellar mass would be too large to remain consistent with other LRD properties. Therefore, a purely stellar origin is unlikely to be the dominant power source, although star formation may still contribute to the UV emission. (3) The coexistence of broad-line emission with Balmer absorption and break features on LRD spectra, neither of which can be explained by stellar populations, suggests that nuclear BHs are enshrouded by dense gas with a high covering fraction. (4) Gas-enshrouded AGNs can produce red optical spectra without requiring dust reddening through a combination of gas attenuation and thermal self-emission with an effective temperature of $T_{\\rm eff}\\simeq 5000~{\\rm K}$, which also accounts for the flat infrared continuum. (5) From the spectral features and redshift evolution, LRDs are likely a transient phase in early BH growth, possibly the first accretion episodes of newborn BHs. (6) Testing models for LRD spectra and origins through time variability, ionizing sources, post-LRD objects, and low-redshift analogs is particularly promising.",

Comments Welcome! See also arxiv.2512.00148 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Astrophysical searches for dark matter in the Milky Way require a reliable model for its density distribution, which in turn depends on the influence of baryonic feedback on the Galaxy. In this work, we utilize a new suite of Milky Way-mass halos from the DREAMS Project, simulated with Cold Dark Matter (CDM),to quantify the influence of baryon feedback and intrinsic halo-to-halo variance on dark matter density profiles. Our suite of 1024 halos varies over supernova and black hole feedback parameters from the IllustrisTNG model, as well as variations in two cosmological parameters. We find that Milky Way-mass dark matter density profiles in the IllustrisTNG model are largely insensitive to astrophysics and cosmology variations, with the dominant source of scatter instead arising from halo-to-halo variance. However, most of the (comparatively minor) feedback-driven variations come from the changes to supernova prescriptions. By comparing to dark matter-only simulations, we find that the strongest supernova wind energies are so effective at preventing galaxy formation that the halos are nearly entirely collisionless dark matter. Finally, regardless of physics variation, all the DREAMS halos are roughly consistent with a halo contracting adiabatically from the presence of baryons, unlike models that have bursty stellar feedback. This work represents a step toward assessing the robustness of Milky Way dark matter profiles, with direct implications for dark matter searches where systematic uncertainty in the density profile remains a major challenge.",

Venemans, F. Walter, F. Xu 18 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication on A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Quasars at the dawn of Cosmic Time ($z>6$) are fundamental probes to investigate the early co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxy. Nevertheless, their infrared spectral energy distribution remains at the present time poorly constrained, due to the limited photometric coverage probing the far-infrared wavelength range where the dust modified black-body is expected to peak ($\\sim80$ $\\mathrm{\\mu m}$). Here we present a study of the high-frequency dust emission via a dedicated ALMA Band 8 ($\\sim$400 GHz) campaign targeting 11 quasar host galaxies at $6<z<7$. Combined with archival observations in other ALMA bands, this program enables a detailed characterization of their infrared emission, allowing for the derivation of dust masses ($M_{d}$), dust emissivity indexes ($\\beta$), dust temperatures ($T_{d}$), infrared luminosities ($L_{IR}$), and associated star formation rates (SFRs). Our analysis confirms that dust temperature is on average higher in this sample (34-65 K) if compared to local main-sequence galaxies' values, and that this finding can be linked to the increased star formation efficiency we derive in our work, as also suggested by the [CII]$_{158\\mu m}$ deficit. Most remarkably, we note that the average value of $T_d$ of this sample doesn't differ from the one that is observed in luminous, ultra-luminous and hyper-luminous infrared galaxies at different redshifts that show no signs of hosting a quasar. Finally, our findings suggest that the presence of a bright AGN does not significantly bias the derived infrared properties, although further high-frequency, high-spatial resolution observations might reveal more subtle impacts on sub-kiloparsec scales.",

Jang, Wonki Lee, Emanuele Contini, Bumhyun Lee, Jaehyun Lee, Katarina Kraljic, Sébastien Peirani 16 pages, 11 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate how low-mass group environments ($M_{\\rm vir} \\sim 10^{12-13}\\,M_{\\odot}$) influence the gas content of their satellite galaxies with $M_* > 10^{7}\\,M_{\\odot}$ using the \\NHtwo\\ simulation. Many satellite galaxies preserve substantial gas reservoirs, yet show signs of outer gas stripping, reminiscent of jellyfish galaxies in clusters. In contrast, low-mass satellites ($<10^8 \\, M_{\\odot}$) are largely gas-deficient, and some of them undergo gas removal within their host group by external pressure triggered by either galaxy interactions or ram pressure exerted by the hot intragroup medium. Complete gas removal in these satellite galaxies occurs when the external hydrodynamic pressure exceeds the gravitational restoring force, typically due to stochastic events such as galaxy-galaxy interaction or nearby galactic outflows. The emergence of a characteristic stellar mass of $10^8 \\, M_{\\odot}$ which determines the efficiency of gas removal in groups, likely reflects the differing scaling relations of external pressure with halo mass and gravitational restoring force with stellar mass. While tidal interactions can be a significant cause of gas loss in satellite galaxies, those severe enough to affect the gas content in the central regions typically lead to the complete disruption of the galaxy. Consequently, gas loss driven by tidal interactions may be underestimated in the studies focusing solely on surviving galaxies. Group environments, where environmental effects are weaker and satellite galaxies tend to have lower restoring forces due to their low masses, exhibit complex manifestations of gas loss that are not seen in more massive environments such as clusters.",

Despite its status as the benchmark system for dark matter and merger studies, inferred mass ratios for the Bullet Cluster have spanned a wide range from $\\sim$2:1 to $\\gtrsim$10:1 over more than two decades. We revisit this tension through three key advances: (1) JWST's exceptional data quality enables us to resolve three distinct halos, (2) DECam's wide-field coverage beyond its virial radius eliminates the need for extrapolation, and (3) high-fidelity strong-lensing priors mitigate weak-lensing model bias. We obtain $M_{200c} = 15.11^{+2.48}_{-2.10} \\times 10^{14}M_{\\odot}$ for the main cluster and $1.49^{+0.32}_{-0.25} \\times 10^{14}M_{\\odot}$ for the subcluster, yielding a mass ratio of $10.14^{+3.22}_{-2.47}$, definitively classifying the Bullet Cluster as a minor merger.

Comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) JWST has revealed unexpectedly bright galaxies in the first 500 Myr after the Big Bang. Their overabundance suggests that they are preferentially observed during burst phases, where their star formation rates increase dramatically. In cosmological simulations, such bursts transition into short ($\\approx 40$ Myr) periods without star formation or naps. Using JWST/NIRCam medium-band observations, we report the discovery of the galaxy CANUCS-A370-2228423 ($z = 5.95 \\pm 0.06$, $\\log(M_\\ast/M_{\\odot}) = 9.14 \\pm 0.09$), dubbed The Sleeper. Its star formation history indicates rapid assembly in the first 300 Myr ($z \\gtrsim 14$), where it formed a $\\log(M_\\ast/M_{\\odot}) = 8.7^{+0.3}_{-0.4}\\ M_{\\odot}$ progenitor, comparable in stellar mass to the few spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at those redshifts. Unexpectedly, this is followed by several hundred million years of suppressed star formation, in stark contrast to nappers. This results in a remarkably strong hydrogen Balmer break, exceeding that of any galaxy observed within the first billion years by a factor of $\\approx 3$. Furthermore, Sleeper-like systems are overabundant in the observed survey volume compared to theory, as the probability of finding such galaxies in simulations is $< 0.2\\%$. The discovery of The Sleeper therefore disrupts the current narrative that all luminous galaxies in the first few hundred million years grow into massive descendants. Instead it presents an alternative evolutionary pathway in which these unusually luminous galaxies fade into inefficient dwarfs after an early starburst, revealing greater diversity in the first stages of galaxy evolution.",

Baggen, Pieter van Dokkum, Ivo Labbé, Gabriel Brammer Submitted to AAS Journals, comments are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present a luminous Little Red Dot (LRD) at $z=6.027$, doubly imaged by the galaxy cluster Abell 383 and observed with JWST/NIRCam. The source shows the characteristic \"V-shaped\" SED and pronounced Balmer break that define the LRD population. Owing to its large magnifications, $\\mu\\sim11$ for image S1 and $\\mu\\sim7$ for S2, the system is exceptionally bright and highly stretched, providing a rare, spatially resolved view of an LRD. The images reveal a complex morphology with a compact red dot, a spatially offset blue dot, and faint emission bridging and surrounding the two. After correcting for lensing, we find that both dots are extremely small but resolved, with rest-frame UV sizes of $\\sim 20$ pc (red) and $\\sim60$ pc (blue). These compact dots are embedded in a more extended, line-dominated cloud traced most clearly in F356W ([OIII]+H$\\beta$), which reaches scales of order $\\sim$1 kpc. SED decomposition shows that the blue component has a flat UV continuum consistent with a young stellar population, whereas the red component has a steep red SED that can be interpreted as either an evolved stellar population with high stellar mass ($\\log M_\\star/M_\\odot>10$) or a reddened AGN. If this object is representative of the LRD population, our results imply that the V-shaped SEDs of LRDs do not arise from individual compact sources but instead from the superposition of two physically distinct components. Separated by only $\\sim300$ pc in the source plane, these components would blend into a single compact source in unlensed observations with the canonical LRD colors. This system therefore provides a rare opportunity to resolve the internal structure of an LRD and to gain direct insight into the physical nature of this population.",

One of the most important discoveries by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the unexpected existence in the Early Universe (z > 4) of very large quantities of \"Little Red Dots\" (LRDs), compact luminous red galaxies of intriguing physical properties. Aims. We wish to know if LRDs may host accreting Intermediate/Supermassive Black Holes (IMBHs/SMBHs) that may power LRDs, and compare them with the effect of clusters of massive stars. The spectrum of radio emission (synchrotron vs thermal) can be used to know which between these two types of energy sources is the dominant one. Methods. So far LRDs at high redshifts have not been detected at radio wavelengths and it is not known why. Assuming this could be due to their large distances and/or present limitations of observational capabilities, we analyze here archive Very Large Array radio observations of two analog candidates of LRDs in the Local Universe (LLRDs) at redshifts z = 0.1 - 0.2. Results. The LLRD source J1047+0739 at z = 0.1682 is detected at 6.0 GHz in 2018 with the VLA-A of NRAO as a compact source with radii less than 0.2 arc sec (< 600 pc at d = 700 Mpc). Its flux density was 117$\\pm$8 $\\mu$Jy and its spectral index was -0.85, which is typical of optically-thin synchrotron emission. It is also detected at 5.0 GHz in 2010 with the VLA-C, showing a flux density of 43$\\pm$3 $\\mu$Jy. Conclusions. The observed flux densities can be provided by a radio luminous supernova. The increase in flux density over eight years can be explained as the result of two independent supernovae or as the radio re-brightening of a single one. Radio time monitoring of this and other LLRDs could help clarify the mystery of the radio silence of its cosmological counterparts.",

Hill, Jennifer L. West, Minjie Lei, S. E. Clark, Andrea Bracco, John M. Dickey, Ettore Carretti Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We probe the three-dimensional geometry of the large-scale Galactic magnetic field within 1 kpc of the Sun using the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO) Global Magneto-Ionic Medium Survey (GMIMS) of the Northern Sky (DRAGONS). DRAGONS is a new full polarization survey of the Northern sky from 350 to 1030 MHz covering declinations -20° < $\\delta$ < 90° and a component of GMIMS. The first moment of the Faraday depth spectra produced from DRAGONS above 500 MHz reveals large-angular-scale Faraday depth structures with signs that alternate only once in the Southern Galactic hemisphere and twice in the Northern hemisphere, patterns shared by other Faraday rotation datasets. DRAGONS is the first survey to achieve high Faraday depth resolution while maintaining sensitivity to broad Faraday depth structures, enabling the first use of Galactic longitude-Faraday depth plots. These plots reveal Faraday-complex structures across the sky, indicating a slab-like scenario in which emission and Faraday rotation are mixed. This complexity is overlaid on the same large-scale Faraday depth patterns that appear in the first moment map. We model these patterns as a magnetic reversal slicing through the disk on a diagonal and passing above the Sun in Galactic coordinates. We describe this reversal as a plane with a normal vector parallel to the line directed along ($\\ell$, b) = (168.5°, -60°) and estimate its distance to be between 0.25 and 0.55 kpc. Our results show that much of the observed Faraday sky may be dominated by the local magnetic field configuration.",

Using a probabilistic approach, we identified 770 and 690 high-probability members of NGC 146 and King 14, respectively. Both clusters exhibit well-defined radial density profiles consistent with King models. We estimate the cluster ages as 20 $\\pm$ 5 Myr and 50 $\\pm$ 10 Myr from isochrone fitting, and distances of 2.98 $\\pm$ 0.33 kpc and 2.51 $\\pm$ 0.23 kpc from parallaxes after applying the Bailer-Jones criteria. The clusters show consistent mean proper motions. The mass function slopes (1.51 $\\pm$ 0.18 and 1.50 $\\pm$ 0.15) are close to the Salpeter value, and the extinction follows a normal Galactic reddening law (RV ~ 3.1). Three-dimensional mapping gives a projected separation of ~ 9 pc. Orbit integration using the galpy MWPotential2014 model shows that NGC 146 and King 14 move in nearly circular, disk-like orbits with similar mean orbital radii (Rm ~ 9 kpc) and orbital periods of roughly 255 Myr. A dynamical separation of ~ 32 pc indicates that both clusters share a common spatial and kinematic association, consistent with a co-moving pair. However, their relative velocity exceeds the escape velocity set by their combined mass, indicating they are not gravitationally bound. TESS light curves reveal seven variable stars, including $\\gamma$ Doradus, SPB stars, and eclipsing binaries, though only one is a likely member. Overall, the clusters likely formed within the same giant molecular cloud and now exist as an unbound co-moving pair.",

By using the year 1 dataset of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and QSOs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey, we construct a sample of approximately 600,000 galaxy-quasar pairs and measure the radial distribution and kinematics of the cool gas traced by Mg II absorption lines as a function of galaxy properties from redshift 0.4 to redshift 1.2. Our results show that the covering fraction of the cool gas around LRGs increases with redshift, following a trend similar to the global evolution of galaxy star formation rate. At small radii (< 0.3rvir), the covering fraction anti-correlates with stellar mass, suggesting that mass-dependent processes suppress the cool gas content in the inner region. In addition, we measure the gas dispersion by modeling the velocity distribution of absorbers with a narrow and a broad components -- sigma_n ~ 60 and sigma_b ~ 380 km/s -- and quantify their relative contributions. The results show that the broad component becomes more prominent in the outer region, and its relative importance in the central region grows with increasing stellar mass. Finally, we discuss possible origins of the cool gas around massive galaxies, including the contribution of satellite galaxies and the precipitation scenario.",

However, all these methods rely on hard selection cuts, which either contaminate samples when relaxed or exclude genuine members when applied too strictly, leading to uncertain and biased classifications. We develop a flexible and reliable approach to classify disk and halo stars in galaxies by applying fuzzy set theory, which can overcome the limitations of traditional hard-cut selection methods. As a case study, we analyze one of the Milky Way/M31-like galaxies in the TNG50 catalogue. We consider multiple stellar properties as fuzzy variables and characterize their variations between disk and halo stars to construct the respective membership functions. These functions are then combined to assign each star a membership degree corresponding to its galactic component. Our fuzzy set approach provides a more realistic distinction between the disk and the halo stars. This method effectively reduces contamination and recovers genuine members that are often excluded by rigid selection criteria. The fuzzy set theory framework offers a robust alternative to conventional hard-cut methods, enabling more accurate and physically meaningful separation of stellar populations in galaxies.",

Currently under the revision process in A&A after positive referee report Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Nuclear star clusters (NSC) are dense and compact stellar systems, of sizes of few parsecs, located at galactic centers. Their properties and formation mechanisms seem to be tightly linked to the evolution of the host galaxy, with potentially different formation channels for late- and early-type galaxies (respectively, LTGs and ETGs). While most observations target ETGs, here we focus on the NSC in M 74 (NGC 628), a relatively massive, gas-rich and star-forming spiral galaxy, part of the PHANGS survey. We analyzed the central arcmin of the PHANGS-MUSE mosaic, in which the NSC is not spatially resolved. We performed a two-dimensional spectro-photometric decomposition of the MUSE cube, employing a modified version of the C2D code, to disentangle the NSC from the host galaxy. Here we used three components: a bulge, a disk and a NSC approximated to the point spread function (PSF), obtaining three data cubes, one for each component. This allowed us to extract separately the age, metallicity and [Mg/Fe] abundance for the NSC and the host galaxy. Our results show a very old and metal-poor NSC, in contrast to the surrounding regions. While similar properties were found in NSCs hosted by galaxies of different masses and/or morphological types from M 74, they are somewhat unexpected for a relatively massive star-forming spiral galaxy. The spatially resolved stellar populations of the host galaxy display much younger (light-weighted) ages and higher metallicities, especially in the central region (${\\sim}500$ pc) surrounding the NSC. This suggests that this NSC formed a long time ago, and evolved passively until today, without any further growth. Our results show that the NSC was not involved in the active recent star-formation history of its host galaxy.",

Kewley 20 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in the ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Recent JWST observations have revealed a population of high-redshift galaxies ($z\\gtrsim5$) exhibiting unexpectedly bright ultraviolet (UV) nitrogen emission lines. The strong N III] and N IV] features imply nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios (N/O) as high as $-0.8 \\lesssim \\log(\\mathrm{N/O}) \\lesssim 0.4$ in these low-metallicity galaxies ($12+\\log(\\mathrm{O/H}) \\lesssim 8.2$), compared to the local value of $\\log(\\mathrm{N/O})\\approx-1.5$. If confirmed, this level of nitrogen enrichment challenges existing models of nucleosynthesis and galaxy evolution. However, the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can affect spectral diagnostics, and previous studies often excluded AGN contamination using photoionization models based on local N/O ratios. In this work, we compare nitrogen-enhanced AGN and H II region models to observed spectra of eight high-redshift galaxies to constrain their nitrogen abundance, excitation source, gas-phase metallicity, ionization parameter, and gas pressure, simultaneously. We find seven galaxies (GHZ9, GS 3073, GN-z9p4, CEERS-1019, GHZ2, GN-z11, and GS-z9-0) are best described by nitrogen-enhanced AGN models, while RXCJ2248-ID is best reproduced by the nitrogen-enhanced H II model. The presence of AGN does not significantly impact ($\\lesssim0.1\\,$dex) the derived N/O ratio. We also find that equivalent width (EW)-based diagrams are the most robust UV diagnostic diagrams to distinguish AGNs and star-forming galaxies for situations where the nitrogen abundance is varying. All nitrogen-enhanced galaxies have moderate to high gas pressure ($7.0\\leq\\log (P/k)\\leq9.8$) and high ionization parameter ($\\log(U)\\gtrsim-2.0$), indicating a dense and compact environment. We suggest that super star clusters containing Wolf-Rayet stars and massive stars are the most likely contributors to the elevated nitrogen abundance in these galaxies.",

Lindberg, Kristen B. W. McQuinn, Max J. B. Newman, O. Grace Telford, Dries Van De Putte, Benjamin F. Williams Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The mid-infrared spectrum of star-forming, high metallicity galaxies is dominated by emission features from aromatic and aliphatic bonds in small carbonaceous dust grains, often referred to as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In metal-poor galaxies, the abundance of PAHs relative to the total dust sharply declines, but the origin of this deficit is unknown. We present JWST observations that detect and resolve emission from PAHs in the 7% Solar metallicity galaxy Sextans A, representing the lowest metallicity detection of PAH emission to date. In contrast to higher metallicity galaxies, the clumps of PAH emission are compact (0.5-1.5'' or 3-10 pc), which explains why PAH emission evaded detection by lower resolution instruments like Spitzer. Ratios between the 3.3, 7.7, and 11.3 $\\mu$m PAH features indicate that the PAH grains in Sextans A are small and neutral, with no evidence of significant processing from the hard radiation fields within the galaxy. These results favor inhibited grain growth over enhanced destruction as the origin of the low PAH abundance in Sextans A. The compact clumps of PAH emission are likely active sites of in-situ PAH growth within a dense, well-shielded phase of the interstellar medium. Our results show that PAHs can form and survive in extremely metal-poor environments common early in the evolution of the Universe.",

Wiegert Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We modeled the trajectories of material ejected from 20 nearby debris disk stars, including Epsilon Eridani (Ran), Vega, Fomalhaut, and Beta Pictoris, within a simulated Milky Way potential in order to quantify their contribution to the population of interstellar material entering the solar system. Our simulations show that material from each of these 20 systems is currently to be expected within our planetary system. We calculate expected fluxes of both macroscopic interstellar objects (ISOs, $\\geq100~$m), which could be detected by telescopic surveys, and smaller meteoroids ($\\geq200~$microns), which could manifest as meteors in Earth's atmosphere. We estimate that the ISO population originating from these debris disks and currently within the inner solar system is on the order of ~2, only a fraction of the expected total ISO population but nonetheless likely to be discovered by Rubin. Meteors in Earth's atmosphere from these systems are expected as well, but current methods, both radar and video, might require decades to collect even a single event. Our sample is found to be rich in relatively low excess velocity particles compared to the broader expected ISO population, which might make them harder to distinguish observationally from bound objects in some cases. These results provide a framework for linking detections of interstellar material to their astrophysical origins, offering new opportunities to probe the composition and dynamical history of nearby planetary systems.",

The heating of the ISM by supernova shocks, and its subsequent cooling is critical to future star formation. The cooling of the diffuse shock-heated ISM is dominated by ultraviolet (UV) emission lines. These cooling regions and interfaces have complex spatial structure on sub-parsec scales. Mapping this cooling process is essential to understanding the feedback cycle of galaxies, a major goal of the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey.

SPRITE aims to provide new insights into the stellar feedback that drives galaxy evolution by mapping key FUV emission lines at the interaction lines between supernova remnants (SNRs) and the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). SPRITE will also measure the ionizing escape from approximately 50 low-redshift (0.16 < z < 0.4) star-forming galaxies. Current models predict SPRITE capable of detecting strong O VI, O IV], and C IV emission lines with angular resolution from 10 - 20 arcseconds. The SPRITE SNR survey will use push-broom mapping of its long-slit on extended sources to produce the first large sample of sub-arcminute 3D data cubes of extended sources in the FUV. In this paper, we present simulated SPRITE observations of Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) SNRs to demonstrate the efficacy of the SPRITE instrument ahead of launch and instrument commissioning. These models serve as critical planning tools and incorporate the final pre-flight predicted performance of the instrument and the early extended source data reduction pipeline.",

Terry, N. Arredondo, A. Scharf Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We present the open-source Python package, BAGLE (Bayesian Analysis of Gravitational Lensing Events), which enables modeling and joint fitting of photometric and astrometric data sets. We describe the model parameterizations and present the equations for microlensing events containing either a point-source, point-lens or a finite-source, point-lens geometry both with and without microlensing parallax due to the motion of the Earth or a satellite around the Sun. Conversions between different coordinate reference frames are also derived. We compare our model light curves to those from other papers and microlens modeling software, finding good agreement, although with some differences in finite-source models at a ~1% level detectable with upcoming observations from space-based facilities. We also use BAGLE to demonstrate the impact of changing lens mass, lens distance, and blended source flux fraction on photometric lightcurves and astrometric trajectories in preparation for upcoming Gaia data releases and the launch of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and its Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS). In particular, we show that Roman GBTDS will detect significant microlensing parallax signals for events that are 2x shorter in duration than from ground-based surveys. Additionally, long-duration events with durations of $\\t_{E,\\odot} >$ 100 days will yield microlensing parallax uncertainties of ${\\sigma}_{\\pi_E} <$ 0.01 with Roman, enabling confident identification of isolated stellar-mass black holes that can be modeled both astrometrically and photometrically with BAGLE for precise mass determinations. BAGLE is an open-source code and community development is encouraged.",

Huston 23 pages, 19 figures, 5 Tables, Submitted to AAS Journals Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Gravitational microlensing is a powerful tool that can be used to find and measure the mass of isolated and dark compact objects. In many microlensing events, the lens, the source, or both may be a binary system. Therefore, in this study we present lensing equations for binary source and lens models in the Bayesian Analysis of Gravitational Lensing Events (BAGLE) Python microlensing package. The new binary source and lens models in BAGLE account for the complete Keplerian orbit. BAGLE also includes binary models that approximate the orbital motion as linear or accelerating motion of the secondary companion; these are useful when the orbit has a very low eccentricity or the orbital period is much longer than the microlensing timescale. The model parameterizations based on these binary lensing equations will enable joint fitting of photometric and astrometric data sets. Consequently, binary microlensing events with complex astrometric trajectories can be used to break several microlensing degeneracies that plague photometry-only microlensing modeling. These binary models will be used to fit microlensing event data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope, and other surveys.",

We aim to identify mid-infrared H~\\textsc{i} transitions that can serve as reliable accretion diagnostics in young stars, and evaluate their utility in deriving physical conditions of the accreting gas. We identify and measure 22 H~\\textsc{i} transitions in the MIRI wavelength regime (5-28 $\\mu m$) and perform LTE slab modelling to remove the H\\textsubscript{2}O contribution from selected H~\\textsc{i} transitions. We find that mid-IR H~\\textsc{i} line emission is spatially compact, even for sources with spatially extended [Ne~\\textsc{ii}] and [Fe~\\textsc{ii}] jets, suggesting minimal contamination from extended jet. Although Pfund~$\\alpha$ (H~\\textsc{i}~6--5) and Humphreys~$\\alpha$ (H~\\textsc{i}~7--6) are the strongest lines, they are blended with H$_2$O transitions. This blending necessitates additional processing to remove molecular contamination, thereby limiting their use as accretion diagnostics. Instead, we identify the H~\\textsc{i}~(8--6) at 7.502 $\\mu m$ and H~\\textsc{i}~(10--7) at 8.760 $\\mu m$ transitions as better alternatives, as they are largely unaffected by molecular contamination and offer a more reliable means of measuring accretion rates from MIRI spectra. We provide updated empirical relations for converting mid-IR H~\\textsc{i} line luminosities into accretion luminosity for 6 different H~\\textsc{i} lines in the MIRI wavelength range. Moreover, comparison of observed line ratios with theoretical models shows that MIR H~\\textsc{i} lines offer robust constraints on the hydrogen gas density in accretion columns, $n_\\mathrm{H} = $10$^{10.6}$ to 10$^{11.2}$ cm$^{-3}$ in most stars, with some stars exhibiting lower densities ($<10^{10}$~cm$^{-3}$), approaching the optically thin regime.",

The observations covered a period of over 10 years in four epochs between March 2010 and March 2020.

The new maser emission was located close to the strongest (sub)millimetre source in NGC6334I-MM1, identified as MM1-B, which experienced a sudden increase in intensity in 2015, produced by an episodic accretion event. We are able to compare the location and intensity of the 6.7-GHz methanol maser emission among the epochs before, during, and after the flare, providing new insights into the relationship between maser flares and episodic accretion events in high-mass stars.",

Nicole Sanchez, Yakov Faerman, Sijing Shen, Akaxia Cruz, Ben Keller, Thomas R. Quinn, James Wadsley Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Dwarf galaxies are uniquely sensitive to energetic feedback processes and are known to experience substantial mass and metal loss from their disk. Here, we investigate the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of 64 isolated dwarf galaxies ($6.0<$log(M$_*/M_{\\odot}$)$<9.5$) at $z=0$ from the Marvel-ous Dwarfs and Marvelous Massive Dwarfs hydrodynamic simulations. Our galaxies produce column densities broadly consistent with current observations. We investigate these column densities in the context of mass and metal retention rates and the physical properties of the CGM. We find $48\\pm11\\%$ of all baryons within $R_{200c}$ reside in the CGM, with $\\sim70\\%$ of CGM mass existing in a warm gas phase, $10^{4.5}<T<10^{5.5}$ K that dominates beyond $r/R_{200c}\\sim0.5$. Further, the warm and cool ($10^{4.0}<T<10^{4.5}$ K) gas phases each retain $5-10\\%$ of metals formed by the dwarf galaxy. The significant fraction of mass and metals residing in the warm CGM phase provides an interpretation for the lack of observed low ion detections beyond $b/R_{200c}\\sim0.5$ at $z\\sim0$, as the majority of mass in this region exists in higher ions. We find a weak correlation between galaxy mass and total CGM metal retention despite the fraction of metals lost from the halo increasing from $\\sim10\\%$ to $>40\\%$ towards lower masses. Our findings highlight the CGM (primarily its warm component) as a key reservoir of mass and metals for dwarf galaxies across stellar masses and underscore its importance in understanding the baryon cycle in the low-mass regime. Finally, we provide individual galaxy properties of our full sample and quantify the fraction of ultraviolet observable mass to support future observational programs, particularly those aimed at performing a metal budget around dwarf galaxies.",

      "abstract": "Constraints on a dark matter sub-halo near the Sun from pulsar timing Sukanya Chakrabarti, Philip Chang, Stefano Profumo, Peter Craig Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Using pulsar accelerations, we identify and constrain the properties of a dark matter sub-halo in the Galaxy for the first time from analyzing the acceleration field of binary and solitary pulsars. Our MCMC calculations show that this sub-halo has a mass of $2.45^{+1.07}_{-0.96} \\times 10^{7}~M_{\\odot}$ and is located at Galactocentric coordinates $X = 7.43^{+0.2}_{-0.12}~\\rm$ kpc, $Y = 0.38^{+0.11}_{-0.16} ~\\rm kpc$, $Z = 0.21^{+0.06}_{-0.11} ~\\rm kpc$, using flat, uninformative priors, where we have modeled the sub-halo as a compact object. The Bayes factors for the models are in the range of $\\sim$ 20-40, which indicates tentative evidence (though not yet decisive) for the sub-halo. Modeling the sub-halo with a NFW profile gives a sub-halo mass within the scale radius (0.1 kpc) of $0.48^{0.15}_{-0.16} \\times 10^{7} M_{\\odot}$, located at $X = 7.47^{+0.21}_{-0.14}$, $Y=0.38^{+0.11}_{-0.16}$, $Z=0.21^{+0.06}_{-0.11}$. We examine \\textit{Gaia} data and the atomic and molecular hydrogen data of our Galaxy and show that the measured deviation from a smooth potential cannot arise from the gas or the stars in our Galaxy. By analyzing the full sample of binary pulsars with available acceleration measurements, we find that massive (with mass $>10^{8}~M_{\\odot}~$) sub-halos are disfavored for the Milky Way within several kiloparsec of the Sun. Smaller sub-halos are beyond the reach of current direct acceleration measurements. The presence of a $\\sim 10^{7}~M_{\\odot}$ sub-halo within a few kpc of the Sun is potentially consistent with the expected number counts of sub-halos in the prevailing $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm, for a substantial sub-halo mass fraction. This work now provides a proof of principle for probing nearby, low-mass sub-halos, and has implications across many fields of astrophysics - from understanding the nature of dark matter to galaxy formation.",

In this work, we aim to find a simple and effective formula to estimate the stellar mass from the images of galaxies delivered by the currently popular DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. This survey provides an unsurpassed combination of a deep imaging with an extensive sky coverage in up to four photometric bands. We calibrated the sought formula against a sample of local galaxies observed by the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^4$G) that was directly dedicated to measure the stellar masses. For the absolute magnitudes $M_g$ and $M_r$ of a galaxy in the Legacy Surveys $g$ and $r$ bands, we find that the stellar masses can be estimated as $0.673M_g - 1.108M_r + 0.996$ with the scatter of 25\\%. Employing more complex functions does not improve the estimate appreciably, even after including the galaxy ellipticity, Sérsic index, or the magnitudes in different Legacy Surveys bands. Generally, measurements in $r$ band were the most helpful ones, while adding $z$-band measurements did not improve the mass estimate much. We provide a Python-based script \\texttt{photomass\\this http URL} to automatically download images of any galaxy from the Legacy Surveys database, create image masks, generate GALFIT input files with well-assessed initial values, perform the GALFIT photometry, and calculate the stellar mass estimate. Additionally, we tuned another version of the formula to the magnitudes provided by the Siena Galaxy Atlas 2020 (SGA-2020) with a scatter of 29\\%.

Star-forming galaxies are identified using the $g-z$ color, and $F_{\\mathrm{sf}}$ is measured as a function of redshift, cluster halo mass, and galaxy stellar mass. Field galaxies are used as a comparison sample to reduce selection effects. For BCGs, $F_{\\mathrm{sf}}$ increases with redshift, showing a slow rise below $z \\sim 0.4 - 0.5$ and a more rapid increase above this range. In contrast, $F_{\\mathrm{sf}}$ decreases with increasing cluster halo mass and BCG stellar mass. At the low stellar mass end, BCGs exhibit higher star-forming fractions than field galaxies, suggesting enhanced star formation likely fueled by cold gas accretion from the intracluster medium. Also, star-forming BCGs tend to show larger projected offsets from the optical cluster density peak than quenching BCGs, indicating ongoing assembly. The analysis of the specific star formation rate (sSFR) further indicates a transition in the dominant mechanism driving star formation in BCGs: cooling flows are likely responsible at low redshift, while gas-rich mergers play a greater role at higher redshift. The shift in dominance occurs around $z \\sim 0.5$, aligning with the steep rise in $F_{\\mathrm{sf}}$ of BCG.",

The source cid_414 shows a narrow Ly$\\alpha$ emission line with luminosity $\\log L_{\\rm Ly\\alpha}=42.49\\pm0.01~\\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$ and a higher intrinsic 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity. Host-galaxy decomposition and multi-component SED fitting indicate that cid_947 hosts a more massive black hole but lower star formation rate than cid_414. From simplified photoionization modeling, we infer that the dense absorbing gas has a characteristic size comparable to the nuclear broad-line region and is likely kinematically coupled to the obscuration associated with the dust torus. He I$\\lambda$1083 absorption has also been identified in several compact little red dots at similar redshifts. Together with the two AGNs reported here, these findings suggest that dense circumnuclear gas are plausibly prevalent at high redshift and plays an important role in regulating AGN obscuration and black hole--host co-evolution.",

Meidt, Angelos Nersesian, Katherine Whitaker, Stijn Wuyts Accepted for publication on A&A; 12 pages with 8 figures, 4 pages appendix with 3 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present the redshift evolution of radial color gradients (in rest-frame ${\\textit{U}} - {\\textit{V}}$ and ${\\textit{V}} - {\\textit{J}}$) for galaxies in the range $0.5<$ z $<2.5$ and investigate their origin and dependence on stellar mass. We select $\\sim 10,200$ galaxies with stellar masses $M_\\star>10^{9.5}~{\\text{M}}_\\odot$ from publicly available JWST/NIRCam-selected catalogs. Using 2D Sérsic profile fits to account for PSF broadening, we perform spatially resolved SED fitting on HST and JWST/NIRCam photometry retrieving accurate rest-frame ${\\textit{U}} - {\\textit{V}}$ and ${\\textit{V}} - {\\textit{J}}$ color gradients within 2$R_\\text{e, F444W}$. Star-forming galaxies generally exhibit negative ${\\textit{V}} - {\\textit{J}}$ color gradients that are strongly mass and redshift dependent. For massive star-forming galaxies ($M_\\star>10^{10.5}~{\\text{M}}_\\odot$) at $z>1.5$ ${\\textit{V}} - {\\textit{J}}$ colors are $\\approx 0.5$ mag redder within the effective radius than outside, on average. We find that, at all redshifts and across the entire stellar mass range, ${\\textit{V}} - {\\textit{J}}$ gradients strongly correlate with global attenuation ($A_V$), suggesting that they predominantly trace dust attenuation gradients. Edge-on galaxies are redder and have stronger gradients at all $z$, although the correlation weakens at higher $z$. The ${\\textit{U}} - {\\textit{V}}$ and ${\\textit{V}} - {\\textit{J}}$ color gradients in the quiescent galaxy population, in contrast, are weakly negative (from $\\approx -0.1$ to $\\approx- 0.2$ mag), though significant, and show little or no dependence on stellar mass, redshift or axis ratio. The implication is that quiescent galaxies must be largely transparent, with low $A_V$, and color gradients mostly attributable to stellar population gradients.",

Gaia's third Data Release (GDR3) has provided an unprecedented dataset of photometric time series, including 79375 light curves for YSO candidates. With its all-sky coverage, Gaia provides a unique opportunity for large-scale studies of YSO variability. Aims: Our goal was to characterise the GDR3 sample of YSO variables further and verify the recurrence of YSO variability modes due to accretion, extinction, rotation modulation, etc. By adapting the Q&M methodology for Gaia's sparse and long-term light curves, we seek to bridge the gap between low and high-cadence surveys' insights on YSO variability. Methods: We piloted the application of the asymmetry (M) and periodicity (Q) variability metrics to characterise YSO variability with Gaia light curves. Through refined sample selection, we identified sources with appropriate sampling for the Q&M methodology. We used the Generalised Lomb Scargle periodogram and structure functions to infer variability timescales. Results: We successfully derived Q&M indices for ~23000 sources in the GDR3 YSO sample. These variables were then classified into eight variability morphological classes. We linked morphological classes with physical mechanisms by using H$\\alpha$ as a proxy of accretion and $\\alpha_\\mathrm{IR}$-indices to gauge circumstellar material's presence. Conclusions: We demonstrate that the Q&M metrics can be successfully applied to Gaia's sparse time-series. We applied them to distinguish between the several variability modes. While our results are generally consistent with previous high-cadence, short-term studies, we find that GDR3's long timespan yields an enhanced variety of variability mechanisms.",

Studies suggest a presence of strong azimuthal wave motions on the timescale of centuries within the Earth's liquid outer core at higher latitudes. To understand these long-period oscillations, we focus on magnetostrophic waves, a slow component of magnetic-Coriolis waves with $\\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned with the rotation vector $\\bf{\\Omega}$, which replicate the field lines in the azimuthal direction. We present an analytical solution to the magnetic-Coriolis wave equation in Cartesian coordinates. Later, with numerical solution, we validate our analytical estimates and show that magnetostrophic waves travel relatively faster along the magnetic field when $\\bf{B} \\perp \\bf{\\Omega}$ compared with the case when both are aligned. The study confirms that with a magnetic field $\\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned to the rotation vector $\\bf{\\Omega}$, wave vectors satisfying the condition $\\bf{\\Omega}\\cdot\\bf{k} \\approx 0$, travel with Alfvén velocities along the magnetic field lines as a component of inertial-Alfvén waves. The timescales on which Alfvén waves travel are relatively short, and it is also less likely that inertial-Alfvén waves will be sustained inside the core at higher latitudes \\citep{Davidson2017}. This study shows that, excluding the inertial-Alfvén waves contribution ($k_z\\neq 0$), there exists intensified magnetostrophic wave propagation when $\\bf{B} \\perp \\bf{\\Omega}$, which can explain the strong periodic oscillations on the time scales of centuries along the azimuthal field at higher latitudes. Results show persistence of the magnetostrophic waves despite the lower Lehnert number $Le$, suggesting the plausible existence of a low-intensity azimuthal magnetic field in the Earth's core.",

Hofmann 30 pages, 19 figures, published in Astronomy and Astrophysics Astronomy and Astrophysics, 2025, 704, A18 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present high-angular-resolution imaging of the asymptotic giant branch star W Hya with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to probe the dynamics and chemistry in the atmosphere and inner wind. W Hya was observed with the longest baselines of ALMA at 250-268 GHz with an angular resolution of ~17x20 mas. ALMA's high angular resolution allowed us to resolve the stellar disk of W Hya, along with clumpy, irregularly shaped emission extending to ~100 mas: plume in the north-northwest, a tail in the south-southwest, and the extended atmosphere elongated in the east-northeast--west-southwest direction, with semimajor and semiminor axes of ~70 and 40 mas (~3.4 and 1.9 Rstar), respectively. We identified 57 lines, which include SiO, H2O, SO2, SO, HCN, AlO, AlOH, TiO, TiO2, OH, and some of their isotopologues. The molecular line images show spatially inhomogeneous molecular formation. Our ALMA data taken at phase 0.53 (minimum light) indicate global, accelerating infall within ~75 mas (3.6 Rstar) but also outflow at up to ~10 km/s in deeper layers. While 38 of the detected lines appear in absorption against the continuum stellar disk as expected, we detect nonthermal emission on top of the continuum over the stellar disk in 19 lines of SiO, H2O, SO2, and AlO. The emission of SiO, AlO, TiO, TiO2, SO, and SO2 coincides well with the clumpy dust cloud distribution obtained from contemporaneous visible polarimetric imaging in addition to H2O reported in our previous work. This lends support to the idea that SiO, H2O, and AlO are directly involved in grain nucleation. The overlap of SO/SO2 (possibly also TiO/TiO2) with the dust clouds suggests the formation of these molecules and dust behind shocks induced by pulsation and/or convection. We detect HCN emission close to the star, down to ~30 mas (~1.4 Rstar), which is consistent with shock-induced chemistry.",

Sterling, Louise K. Harra, Navdeep K. Panesar, Ronald L. Moore Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Strong EUV lineshifts in solar spectra are generally indicative of highly dynamic and explosive events that are easily detected in comparable-wavelength EUV images, with the strongest such line shifts (several 100 km/s) occurring in solar flares. Here we present observations of exceptionally strong lineshifts detected in Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) spectra outside the time of a flare-like brightening, with 195 Ang blueshifts of ~200 km/s. Although the likely culprit is too weak to register in GOES Soft X-ray fluxes, EIS pinpoints the source at the edge of an active region. Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) images and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) magnetograms show a nondescript small-scale eruptive event at this location. We find this event likely to be an inconspicuous coronal jet, apparently triggered by converging/canceling magnetic flux patches, with plane-of-sky velocity ~159+-29 km/s. AIA and HMI observations of this faint transient feature, together with observations of a slightly brighter jetting event near the same location an hour earlier, suggest that the strong EIS Doppler shifts are indeed due to a coronal jet that is hard to detect in AIA images. These observations, together with other recent studies, show that EUV Doppler maps are a much more sensitive tool for detecting small-scale eruptions than are EUV images, and those eruptions are frequently triggered by magnetic flux cancelation episodes. Such-detected small-scale eruptions, that often produce small-scale coronal-jet-like features, might propagate into and help drive the solar wind.",

Mean-field flux transport dynamo models have successfully reproduced most of the features observed in solar cycles, while the model includes many free parameters, such as the speed of the meridional flow and the amplitude of the poloidal field generation. Inferring these free parameters is on demand because they correspond to the solar interior condition. We suggest a novel method for inferring the free parameters using a genetic algorithm. At each generation, we evaluate the fitness of our simulation against the observational data and optimize the parameters. We apply our method to the observed solar cycle data from 1723 to 2024 and successfully reproduce the observations from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives. We expect our method to be applicable to sunspot numbers, even those obtained from isotope data and historical documents, in the future, to better understand past solar interior dynamics.",

For the first time ever, Solar Orbiter with its remote-sensing instruments observed the poles of the Sun from out of the ecliptic in the Spring of 2025. Here we report the first measurements of the magnetic field of the solar poles taken when Solar Orbiter was at heliographic latitudes ranging between 14.9$^\\circ$ and 16.7$^\\circ$. The data-sets were collected by the High Resolution Telescope of the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (SO/PHI-HRT) on board Solar Orbiter. Two sets of observations, approximately one month apart, for the south and north pole are considered in this work. The magnetic flux and flux density measured during these campaigns are reported as a function of the heliographic latitude observed by SO/PHI-HRT. The net fluxes show a different latitudinal distribution for the two polar caps. We also discuss the observed dependence of the measured fluxes on the viewing angle. These first results highlight the importance of high-resolution direct measurements of the polar field, paving the way to the high-latitude observations planned for SO/PHI-HRT in the coming years.",

Kővári Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Context. Young, solar analogue stars provide key insights into the early stages of stellar evolution, particularly in terms of magnetic activity and rotation. Their rapid rotation, high flaring rate, and enhanced surface activity make them ideal laboratories for testing stellar models or even the solar dynamo. Aims. Using long-term photometric data, we investigated the cyclic behaviour of EK Dra over the last century. We analyze its short- term activity based on 13 Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) sectors. Applying Doppler imaging on high-resolution spectral data we investigate short and long-term spot evolution and surface differential rotation. Methods. We use Short-term Fourier-transform on a 120 years long archival photometric data in order to search for activity cycles. The short-term space photometry data is fitted with an analytic three-spot model, and we hand-select flares from it to analyze their phase and frequency distribution. Spectral synthesis is used to determine the astrophysical parameters of EK Dra. Using the iMap multi-line Doppler imaging code, we reconstruct 13 Doppler images. Differential rotation is derived by cross-correlating consecutive Doppler maps. Results. Long-term photometric data reveal a 10.7-12.1 year cycle that was persistently present for 120 years. In the more recent half of the light curve a 7.3-8.2 years-long signal is also visible. The distribution of the 142 flares in the TESS data shows no correlation with the rotational phase or with the spotted longitudes. The reconstructed Doppler images show a surface that varies from rotation to rotation, putting the lower limit of the spot lifetime between 10-15 days. Based on the cross-correlation of the Doppler maps, EK Dra has a solar-type differential rotation with a surface shear parameter of $\\alpha_{DR} = 0.030 \\pm 0.008$.",

The goal of this study is to further the understanding of the wind formation mechanism in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars through the analysis of the close environment (within a few stellar radii) of the carbon star X TrA. Methods. X TrA was observed for the first time with the Mid-Infrared SpectroScopic Experiment instrument (MATISSE) in the L and N bands in low spectral resolution mode (R=30), and its close surroundings were mapped in specific wavelength ranges corresponding to specific molecules ($C_2H_2$ and HCN, at 3.1 and 3.8 $\\mu$m) and dust (amorphous carbon and, for example, Sic at 11.3 $\\mu$m), via image reconstruction techniques. Results. The angular diameter of the star ranges from 10 mas in the L band pseudo-continuum (3.5 $\\mu$m) to 20 mas at 3.1 and 11.3 $\\mu$m. The reconstructed images show some mild elongated features (along the east-west direction) and asymmetric protrusions, which are most evident around 3.1 $\\mu$m. Imaging results highlight the clumpy nature of the circumstellar environment, starting from the photospheric region up to more distant layers. Conclusions. The angular diameters found for X TrA in the image data are in agreement with previous photospheric diameter estimates (following VLTI/MIDI 8-13 $\\mu$m observations), and their wavelength dependence is similar to values found for other carbon stars observed with MATISSE (R Scl and V Hya). The 3.1 $\\mu$m images presented here show highly asymmetric features, another case of a C-rich star with irregular morphologies close to the stellar disk; this supports the notion that the $C_2H_2+HCN$ abundance distribution usually originates from a clumpy layer around carbon stars.",

      "abstract": "Modeling of Rayleigh Scattering and Interstellar Polarization for Evolved Late-Type Stars R Ignace, C Erba, K DeGennaro, G Henson accepted to Astrophysics & Space Science Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Evolved late-type stars are frequently identified as photometric and spectroscopic variables, such as Mira-type or semi-regular variable objects. These stars can also be polarimetrically variable, an indicator of non-spherical geometry for spatially unresolved sources. Departures from symmetry can arise in a number of ways, such as the presence of a binary companion (e.g., multiple illumination sources for scattered light), brightness variations in the stellar atmosphere (e.g., large convective cells), or aspherical circumstellar envelopes (e.g., disks or aspherical stellar winds). Common polarigenic opacities for cool stars include Rayleigh scattering and dust scattering. The classic wavelength dependence of lambda^-4 for Rayleigh single scattering is generally straightforward; however, that signature can be confounded by interstellar polarization (ISP). We explore strategies for interpreting polarimetric observations when the interstellar polarization (ISP) cannot be removed. We introduce a \"hybrid\" spectrum that includes both Rayleigh polarization for a stellar contribution and the Serkowski Law for an interstellar contribution. We find the polarization spectral slope can be more shallow than expected from Rayleigh scattering alone. For stellar variability, shorter wavelengths give higher amplitude changes when Rayleigh scattering dominates the interstellar signal. Quite anomalous slopes can occur over limited wavelength intervals if the stellar and interstellar position angles differ by 90 deg. Results of the models are discussed in the context of photopolarimetry methods, and an application is considered in terms of variable polarization from the carbon star, R Scl.",

In addition to the superhump modulation, quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) have been found. Aims. Our aim is to determine the occurrence, strength, and variability of QPOs in TT Ari based on more complete data than in previous works. Methods. The data were obtained during the high state of TT Ari in October 2012 by the MOST space telescope, covering a total of 361.2 hours of continuous observation. We searched for frequencies over subsets of time using a Fourier-like power spectrum and then added the frequencies together, forming groups. Results. Our method has revealed QPOs that occur in \"frequency groups\", which are events with a continuous oscillation of similar, constant or slowly variable frequency. We report a total of 160 frequency groups in the period range between 14 and 53 minutes (27 and 98 days-1), with two peaks in the power spectrum at 18.5 and 33.8 minutes (42.5 and 77.5 days-1). The duration of these frequency groups varies between 0.72 and 7.5 hours (average 2.8 hours) revealing between 3 and 18 complete cycles in the light curve. Most of them show significant frequency variations over the course of their duration. Sometimes two frequency groups occur simultaneously. An analysis with randomised data confirms that stochastic processes can only explain a fraction of the QPOs found. The occurrence of QPOs appears not to be related to the superhump phase.",

A. Stuber et al. 2026, The Astronomical Journal, Volume 171, Number 1 Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The system $\\kappa$ Tuc A is part of a hierarchical-quintuple system and is a prime target for studies of hot-exozodiacal dust, because a time-variable near-infrared excess has been detected. We observed the system with the Multi Aperture mid-Infrared Spectroscopic Experiment (MATISSE) and GRAVITY at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer, and detected the stellar companion to the primary $\\kappa$ Tuc Aa that was previously inferred by astrometry, $\\kappa$ Tuc Ab. Its $L$-band flux ratio to the primary is 1.32% and its signature in the MATISSE closure phases is mostly smaller than +/- 2°, which makes $\\kappa$ Tuc Ab the highest-contrast companion ever detected with MATISSE closure phases. We verified with GRAVITY that relative astrometry with milliarcsecond precision can be retrieved from MATISSE closure phases. Using multiple epochs of observations, we obtain a full orbital solution for $\\kappa$ Tuc Ab. Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.94 and a semi-major axis of 4.8au. The orbit of $\\kappa$ Tuc Ab and the orbit of the wider separation companion $\\kappa$ Tuc B are mutually inclined. Based on the measured flux ratio of $\\kappa$ Tuc Ab to Aa and their dynamical mass, we estimate the spectral type of $\\kappa$ Tuc Ab to be M3.5V to M4.5V. While the then unknown star $\\kappa$ Tuc Ab might have caused the putative detection of hot-exozodiacal dust around $\\kappa$ Tuc Aa in 2012 and 2014, this cannot be for the detection in 2019, giving rise to an intriguing system architecture. This motivates studies investigating the interplay of the low-mass star on an eccentric orbit, the hot-exozodiacal dust, and a possible planetesimal reservoir.",

Barczynski, The SPICE consortium Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We investigate the time evolution of relative elemental abundances in the context of the first ionization potential effect focusing on an active region. Our aim is to characterize this evolution in different types of solar active region structures as well as in different atmospheric layers. We wish to assert how the measured changes relate to different magnetic topologies by computing abundance enhancement in different conditions using the ponderomotive force model. Leveraging spectroscopic observations from the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment instrument on board Solar Orbiter, we use extreme ultraviolet lines from ions formed across a broad temperature range--from the upper chromosphere to the low corona--and we perform relative abundance ratios following differential emission measure analysis. This methodology yields relative abundance maps from low, intermediate, and high first ionization potential elements. We obtain the temporal evolution of a number of abundance ratios for different structures on the Sun. We compare these results with the outcomes of the ponderomotive force model. We find good correlation between the model and our results, suggesting an Alfvén-wave driven fractionation of the plasma. Fan loops, loop footpoints and active region boundaries exhibit coronal abundances, while the active region core shows more photospheric-like composition. A slow and steady increase in the magnesium to neon relative first ionization potential bias values is observed, starting around 1.5 and increasing by about 50\\% after two days. The sulfur to oxygen evolution coupled with the model brings evidence of resonant waves fractionating the plasma in transition region structures.",

Link provided to additional supplementary figures on Zenodo and Github repository for model-grid files Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) M-dwarfs are the most dominant stars in the Galaxy. Their interiors and atmospheres exhibit complex processes including dust condensation, convective feedback, and magnetic activity-driven heterogeneity. Standard stellar characterization methods often struggle to capture these coupled effects. Part I of this series introduced SPHINX I, a validated grid of self-consistent radiative-convective model atmospheres and spectra for M-dwarfs with up-to-date molecular opacities suitable for early-to-mid M-dwarfs. Here, we present SPHINX II, which extends the model grid to cover mid-to-late type M-dwarfs, including both gray and physically motivated condensate cloud treatments and shorter convective mixing lengths. We validate SPHINX II using 39 benchmark FGK+M binary systems observed with SpeX IRTF (Mann et al. 2014) and apply it to 32 mid-to-late-type M-dwarfs from the SpeX Prism Library. SPHINX II yields improved fits that are statistically consistent with empirical benchmarks, achieving precisions of 0.078 dex in metallicity and 0.13 dex in C/O. Across the model grid, condensate cloud mass peaks between 2100-2400 K, decreasing sharply toward both cooler and hotter temperatures. We find the onset of the cloud-free regime around 2900 K, and below 2100 K, we see formation of deep/buried clouds. As a case study, we also model Trappist-1 and show that even mass-limited silicate grains subtly modify its emergent spectrum, suppressing near-infrared flux and reddening the mid-infrared slope via shallow cloud formation near 1e-2 bar. In sum, SPHINX II provides an improved framework for constraining the fundamental properties of mid-to-late M-dwarfs.",

Chapin, Tim Hardy, Masen Lamb, Jordan Lothrop, Alan W. McConnachie, Richard Murowinski 22 pages, 12 figures. Accepted for publication in JATIS Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Observations in the near-infrared using large ground-based telescopes are adversely impacted by bright atmospheric emission lines, particularly the OH Meinel bands. These lines can saturate a moderate-resolution spectrograph on the order of minutes, resulting in information loss at the wavelengths of the lines. OH lines also vary on similar timescales, requiring frequent sky exposures to be able to subtract the sky spectrum from that of the target. In this paper we present a new method, which we call bright region reset (BRR), to prevent the saturation of these lines in near-infrared spectra while simultaneously improving information about their variability. This is accomplished by periodically resetting pixels that contain bright lines on a detector capable of sub-window readout while the rest of the detector continues integrating. This method is demonstrated on the McKellar Spectrograph in the 1.2 m telescope at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, Canada. Using a Teledyne H2RG detector, we reset the emission lines produced by an arc lamp while still recording their flux. We show no degradation in the resulting spectrum compared to a conventional observing mode. Unlike other OH line mitigation strategies, the BRR method not only avoids loss of information at wavelengths containing the lines, but also provides higher-cadence information on sky line variability, making it a promising technique for implementation at observatories. We advocate demonstrating this method on sky at existing 8--10 m class facilities with near-infrared spectrographs equipped with HxRG detectors in order to test its feasibility for use in sky subtraction schemes for premier modern spectrographs, including the upcoming generation of instruments for the Extremely Large Telescopes.",

CLASS is a multi-frequency ensemble of telescopes with bands centered at 40, 90, 150, and 220 GHz. Each telescope has arrays of feedhorn-coupled transition edge sensor bolometers at the focal plane. The frequency response is primarily defined by the on-chip bandpass filter with additional contributions coming from the feedhorn, orthomode transducer, and 180-degree hybrid. In this study, we compare simulations and measurements of the frequency response of single pixel witness devices in the 90 GHz band with and without the bandpass filter. For the first time, we can separate the effects of the bandpass filter from the other microwave components using Fourier transform spectroscopy and design splits of the pixel. The results show that the -3 dB band edges are at 80 GHz and 108 GHz. The measurements demonstrate a robust method for characterizing the spectral response of individual components, which is crucial for optimizing the performance of future detector arrays.",

Domingues Mendes, Y. Dominguez Ballesteros, Q. Dorosti, R.C. dos Anjos Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) measures radio emission from high-energy extensive air showers. Consisting of 153 autonomous radio-detector stations spread over $17$\\,km$^2$, it detects radio waves in the frequency range of $30$ to $80$\\,MHz. Accurate characterization of the detector response is crucial for proper interpretation of the collected data. Previously, this was achieved through laboratory measurements of the analog chain and simulations and measurements of the antenna's directional response. In this paper, we perform an absolute calibration using the continuously monitored sidereal modulation of the diffuse Galactic radio emission. Calibration is done by comparing the average frequency spectra recorded by the stations with predictions from seven different models of the full radio sky, accounting for the system response, which includes the antenna, filters, and amplifiers. The analysis of the calibration constants over a period of seven years shows no relevant and no significant ageing effect in the AERA antennas. This result confirms the long-term stability of the detector stations and demonstrates the possibility for a radio detector to effectively monitor ageing effects of other detectors operating over extended periods.",

While the as-flown flight path is unknown, the predicted flight path enables a rough approximation of the source Mach number and location. Six infrasound microphones deployed in the boom carpet along the predicted flight path recorded impulsive signals from the OSIRIS-REx re-entry. Using a suite of atmosphere profiles and the geometric acoustics approximation, we estimate locations with uncertainty estimates along the flight path from which the signals were emitted. Acoustic overpressure and signal duration predictions from Whitham's far field theory, Carlson's simplified sonic boom prediction method, and a drag-dominated hypersonic model are analyzed with uncertainty estimates from the location estimate. While the Carlson simplified sonic boom prediction method could be accurate, our preference is for the drag-dominated source model. Using this source model with an inviscid Burgers' equation solver for propagation, we obtained an excellent match to the recorded data. These results will help better inform future sample return capsule re-entry observation campaigns as well as contribute to a better understanding of high altitude infrasonic sources.",

Greenbaum, A J Eldorado Riggs, Geoffrey Bryden Accepted for publication in JATIS Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The Coronagraph Instrument on board of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will demonstrate key technologies that will prepare the ground for the Habitable Worlds Observatory. The current predictions for the Roman Coronagraph's detection limit range from 1e-8 to a few 1e-9, which would allow for groundbreaking science, such as potentially imaging Jupiter-like planets. However, the performance of the instrument depends on many factors. Simulating images with varying optical error sources can help us connect instrument and observatory performance to science yield. Here we present corosims, a tool to simulate observations of astrophysical scenes with the Coronagraph with evolving errors. This tool wraps around the Coronagraph PROPER diffraction model and detector simulator. We use it to investigate the potential degeneracy between jitter-induced speckles and both hot and warm exozodi disk structures. First, we simulate observations of exozodi around Tau Ceti, with varying jitter. We predict that with nominal post-correction pointing jitter performance (~0.3 mas RMS), the Roman Coronagraph should be sensitive to 12x zodis worth of dust, assuming a face-on (worst case scenario) inclination. We further predict that its sensitivity degrades to 35x zodis if jitter on-target is 3x worse than the nominal value. This estimate assumes the best-modeled wavefront control and stability values from the project, including additional model uncertainty factors. We find that, while jitter hinders warm exozodi detection, jitter residuals are unlikely to result in a false positive. However, if a faint hot exozodi falls at small separation, it may not be distinguishable from jitter-induced speckle residuals of comparable brightness. Finally, we discuss the degeneracies induced between flux and separation retrieved near the inner working angle due the sharp edge of the Roman Coronagraph's focal plane mask.",

As a background, we have the information provided by the texts of early Christian writers, which imposed that churches should be oriented towards the east [..]. The fieldwork that supports our comparative study is based on the measurement of the precise location coordinates, axis' azimuth and angular height of the horizon for most of the churches of the three islands, which amounts to about 120 sets of measurements. For the study of the sample, we have employed various analyses, both statistical, as well as calendric and orographic. Our results show that on all the islands, the pattern of double orientations is repeated, which contemplates the canonical tradition of orienting the altars of churches within the solar range (pointing either eastward or westward). Very few cases also occur where it is possible to identify constructions whose orientation follows solstitial patterns, perhaps as imitation of aboriginal worship. But this double pattern also includes a high proportion of churches with orientations far from this range. An example is Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, both islands subjected to the same flow of the prevailing trade winds in the region, but each with its own characteristics. Another example is given by the particular orography of deep ravines of La Gomera, which determines the orientation of the temples located in those geographical accidents. In this paper we show how the combination of elements of the land- and skyscape can, with a high degree of probability, offer a satisfactory explanation to the particular orientation of these insular centres of worship, which were built during the first decades after the European conquest.",

This implies a significant increase in visibility data volumes, which for single-frequency observations will scale as $\\mathcal{O}(Q^2B)$ for $Q$ antennas and $B$ short-time integration intervals (or batches), calling for efficient data dimensionality reduction techniques. This paper proposes a new approach to data compression during acquisition, coined modulated rank-one projection (MROP). MROP compresses the $Q\\times Q$ batchwise covariance matrix into a smaller number $P$ of random rank-one projections and compresses across time by trading $B$ for a smaller number $M$ of random modulations of the ROP measurement vectors. Firstly, we introduce a dual perspective on the MROP acquisition, which can either be understood as random beamforming, or as a post-correlation compression. Secondly, we analyse the noise statistics of MROPs and demonstrate that the random projections induce a uniform noise level across measurements independently of the visibility-weighting scheme used. Thirdly, we propose a detailed analysis of the memory and computational cost requirements across the data acquisition and image reconstruction stages, with comparison to state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction approaches. Finally, the MROP model is validated for monochromatic intensity imaging both in simulation and from real data, with comparison to the classical and baseline-dependent averaging (BDA) models, and using the uSARA optimisation algorithm for image formation. Our results suggest that the data size necessary to preserve imaging quality using MROPs is reduced to the order of image size, well below the original and BDA data sizes.",

Vigan 57 pages, 33 figures, 13 tables Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) This study aims to characterize debris disks observed with SPHERE across multiple programs, with the goal of identifying systematic trends in disk morphology, dust mass, and grain properties as a function of stellar parameters. We analyzed a sample of 161 young stars using SPHERE observations at optical and near-IR wavelengths. Disk geometries were derived from ellipse fitting and model grids, while dust mass and properties were constrained by modified blackbody (MBB) and size distribution (SD) modeling of SEDs. The dynamical modeling was performed to assess whether the observed disk structures can be explained by the presence of unseen planets. We resolved 51 debris disks, including four new detections: HD 36968, BD-20 951, and the inner belts of HR 8799 and HD 36546. In addition, we found a second transiting giant planet in the HD 114082 system, with a radius of 1.29 $R_{\\rm Jup}$ and an orbital distance of ~1 au. We identified nine multi-belt systems, with outer-to-inner belt radius ratios of $1.5-2$, and found close agreement between scattered-light and millimeter-continuum belt radii. They scale weakly with stellar luminosity ($R_{\\rm belt} \\propto L_{\\star}^{0.11}$), but show steeper dependencies when separated by CO and CO$_2$ freeze-out regimes. Disk fractional luminosities follow collisional decay trends, declining as $t_{\\rm age}^{-1.18}$ for A and $t_{\\rm age}^{-0.81}$ for F stars. The inferred dust masses span $10^{-5}-1\\,M_\\oplus$ from MBB and $0.01-1\\,M_\\oplus$ from SD modeling. These masses scale as $R_{\\rm belt}^n$ with $n>2$ in belt radius and super-linearly with stellar mass, consistent with trends seen in protoplanetary disks. Analysing correlation between disk polarized flux and IR excess, we found an offset of ~1 dex between total-intensity (HST) and polarized fluxes. A new parametric approach to estimate dust albedo and maximum polarization fraction is introduced.",

Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), beginning full operations in late 2025, will dramatically transform solar system science by vastly expanding discoveries and providing detailed characterization opportunities across all small body populations. This includes the co-orbiting 1:1 resonant Neptune Trojans, which are thought to be dynamically hot captures from the protoplanetary disk. Using the survey simulator $\\texttt{Sorcha}$, combined with the latest LSST cadence simulations, we present the very first predictions for the Neptune Trojan yield within the LSST. We forecast a model-dependent median number of $\\sim130-300$ discovered Neptune Trojans, and infer a notable 2:1 detection bias toward the recently emerged L5 cloud near the galactic plane versus the L4 cloud, reflecting the lower-cadence coverage in the Northern Ecliptic Spur region that suppresses L4 detections. The additionally simulated Science Validation survey will offer the very first early insights into this understudied cloud. Around 60\\% of detected main survey Neptune Trojans will meet stringent color light curve quality criteria, increasing the sample size more than fourfold compared to existing datasets. This enhanced sample will enable robust statistical analyses of Neptune Trojan color and size distributions, crucial for understanding their origins and relationship to the broader trans-Neptunian population. These comprehensive color measurements represent a major step forward in characterizing the Neptune Trojan population and will facilitate future targeted spectroscopic observations.",

Here, we exploit a secular resonance to stimulate the orbit of a CBP into strong, disruptive interactions with the host binary. The process requires no tertiary companion and is triggered when the general-relativistic precession of a tightening binary matches the Newtonian precession it induces in its companion planet. Adiabatic capture in this resonance sees the binary draining angular momentum from the CBP's orbit which grows steadily in eccentricity until destabilization, and eventual ejection or engulfment. We map this resonance in phase space, then investigate the dynamical outcomes of encounter in the course of tidally shrinking binaries. With the help of orbit averaged simulations of a suite of systems, we find that, around tightening binaries: eight out of ten CBPs encounter and are captured in the resonance; three out of four are `destroyed'; and survivors lurk on remote, low-transit-probability orbits. This suggests that the very process which forms tight binaries effectively clears the region where transiting CBPs could reside.",

Adams accepted for publication in A&A, 7 pages, including 5 figures, plus 2 pages appendix, including 1 figure Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The primordial structure of Jupiter remains uncertain, yet it holds vital clues on the planet's formation and early evolution. Recent work used dynamical constraints from Jupiter's inner moons to determine its primordial state, thereby providing a novel, formation-era anchor point for interior modeling. Building on this approach, we combine these dynamical constraints with thermal evolution simulations to investigate which primordial structures are consistent with present-day Jupiter. We present 4,250 evolutionary models of the planetary structure, including compositional mixing and helium phase separation, spanning a broad range of initial entropies and composition profiles. We find that Jupiter's present-day structure is best explained by a warm ($4.98_{-2.57}^{+3.00}\\, \\mathrm{k_B\\, m_u^{-1}}$), metal-rich dilute core inherited from formation. To simultaneously satisfy constraints on Jupiter's primordial spin, however, its envelope must have been significantly warmer ($9.32_{-0.58}^{+0.48}\\, \\mathrm{k_B\\, m_u^{-1}}$) at the time of disk dispersal. We determine Jupiter's primordial radius to be $1.89_{-0.49}^{+0.40}\\, \\mathrm{R_J}$. These results provide new constraints on Jupiter's formation, suggesting that most heavy elements were accreted early during runaway gas accretion, and placing bounds on the energy dissipated during the accretion shock.",

Lunine 20 pages, 11 figures, Accepted for publication in PSJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Understanding the deep atmospheric composition of Jupiter provides critical constraints on its formation and the chemical evolution of the solar nebula. In this study, we combine one-dimensional thermochemical kinetic-transport modeling with two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to constrain Jupiter's deep oxygen abundance using carbon monoxide (CO) as a proxy tracer. Leveraging a comprehensive chemical network generated by Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG), we assess the impact of updated reaction rates, including the often-neglected but thermochemically significant Hidaka reaction (CH3OH + H -> CH3 + H2O). Our 1D-2D coupled approach supports a modest supersolar oxygen enrichment of 1.0-1.5x the solar value. We also present a method for deriving Jupiter's eddy diffusion coefficient Kzz = 3e6 to 5e7 cm2/s) from 2D hydrodynamic simulations using the quasi steady-state approach. This method is applicable to exoplanet atmospheres, where Kzz remains highly uncertain despite its strong influence on atmospheric chemistry. Finally, our results imply a significantly elevated planetary carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio of ~2.9, highlighting the importance of clarifying the mechanisms behind the preferential accretion of carbon-rich material during Jupiter's formation. By integrating thermochemical and hydrodynamic processes, our study offers a more complete framework for constraining chemical and dynamical processes in (exo)planetary atmospheres.",
