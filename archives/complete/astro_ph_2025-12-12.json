      "abstract": "Bimetric MOND as a framework for variable-$G$ theories -- local systems and cosmology Mordehai Milgrom Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Bimetric MOND (BIMOND) is used as a platform for variable-$G$ theories that have MOND-specific idiosyncrasies. E.g., MOND premises dictate return to standard dynamics in the high-acceleration limit, predicting the standard value of $G$ for high-acceleration systems. This automatically ensures compliance of such theories with all the constraints on inconstancy of $G$ that emerge from the study of high-acceleration systems: geophysics, solar system, pulsars, supernovae, stellar evolution, emission of gravitational waves, etc. In MOND, constraints deduced from such phenomena have no bearing on possible $G$ variability in cosmology. My guiding motivation is to see if such theories may account for some roles of dark matter in cosmology; e.g., in accounting for the expansion history of the Universe in the matter-dominated era, by having a $G_e\\approx 2\\pi G$ govern the later stages of the expansion, instead of invoking matter density $\\approx 2\\pi\\times$ baryon density. Without adding degrees of freedom, or new dimensionful constants, BIMOND can be extended to a class of theories that entail what is best described as phenomenon-dependence of Newton's constant, $G$. I cannot yet present a consistent model that complies with all the observations in cosmology, including the expansion history, with all its details. Instead, I describe some examples of theories in the class that predict different values of $G_e$ in different circumstances, including one where $G$ takes its standard value for all subcosmological systems -- even if they are deep in the MOND regime. I also discuss scenarios in which $G_e\\approx G$ in the early Universe, as required by constraints from big-bang nucleosynthesis, but with $G_e> G$ setting in at later times, where it can affect the expansion history during the matter-dominated era.",

Barak, Anirudh Pradhan 13 pages, 7 figures, 1 table, Published paper Journal of High Energy Astrophysics, Vol. 50, Issue February, (2026), Article No. 100514 (11 pages) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this study, we investigate the $w$CDM dynamical dark energy model with spatial curvature utilizing the recently released DESI Collaboration data (DR1 and DR2) in conjunction with other observational probes such as BBN, Observational Hubble Data (OHD), and Pantheon Plus (PP). Our investigation attempts to discover which DESI dataset gives a better match to the $w$CDM framework and assess the impact of spatial curvature on cosmological constraints. We find that the cosmic curvature parameter, $\\Omega_k$, disfavors the cosmological constant for the DR2+BBN and DR2+BBN+OHD data combinations. However, the deviation from the cosmological constant remains below the $1\\sigma$ level, indicating a mild preference for a open universe. In contrast, when using the DR1 based combinations namely DR1+BBN and DR1+BBN+OHD-the deviation from the cosmological constant increases to approximately $1.2\\sigma$, suggesting a slightly stronger indication of a open geometry. Also, the best-fit values of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) obtained from the DR1+BBN+OHD+PP and DR2+BBN+OHD+PP combinations within the dynamical dark energy model are consistent with the results reported by the Planck Collaboration. Our findings provide constraints on the dark energy EoS parameter $ w_{\\mathrm{}0}$, reveal a mild but notable deviation from the vacuum energy ($w = -1$) scenario at a significance level $1.8\\sigma$ from DR2+BBN+OHD+PP and $0.5\\sigma$ from DR1+BBN+OHD+PP, both favoring the quintessence region of dark energy. Furthermore, the key physical distance measures $D_H$, $D_V$, and $D_M$ show better consistency with our model when analyzed with the DR2 data.",

A key concern arises if these stellar-mass binary black holes reside in gaseous environments such as active galactic nucleus accretion disks, where environmental effects imprint detectable modulations on the gravita- tional waveform. Using Bayesian inference on simulated signals containing both environmental and dipole deviation, we have assessed the extent to which the presence of environmental effects affects the detectability of dipole radiation. Our results demonstrate that even in the presence of strong environmental coupling, the dipole parameter can be recovered with high precision, and the evidence for dipole radiation remains distinguishable. Crucially, we find that the existence of environmental effects does not fundamentally impede the identification of dipole radiation, provided both effects are simultaneously modelled in the inference process. This study establishes that future tests of modified gravity with space-borne observatories can remain robust even for sources in astrophysical environments.",

As a result, any source fluctuation near the black hole creates multiple lagged images on an observer's screen. For optically thin stochastic emission, these light echoes give rise to correlations of brightness fluctuations across time-dependent images (movies). The correlation pattern disentangles source-specific characteristics from universal features dictated by general relativity. This picture has motivated a proposal to use the two-point image correlation function as a probe of extreme gravitational lensing in upcoming black-hole imaging campaigns. In this work, we test the feasibility of this method by computing the two-point correlation function of brightness fluctuations in a black-hole movie of state-of-the-art realism. The movie is generated by ray tracing a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation, which can then be blurred to any angular resolution. At an effective resolution expected to be achieved by next-generation terrestrial very-long-baseline interferometric arrays, the lensing signatures appear in neither time-averaged images nor light-curve autocorrelations. However, we demonstrate that they are clearly visible in the more fine-grained two-point image correlation function. Our positive findings motivate a more comprehensive investigation into the instrument specifications and inference techniques needed to resolve extreme lensing effects through correlations.",

Thus, Euclid has the potential to test deviations from general relativity that will allow us to shed light on long-lasting problems in the standard cosmological model, $\\Lambda$CDM. Euclid will mainly do this by using two complementary probes: weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering. In this paper we review pre-launch Euclid analyses for dark energy and modified gravity. These include forecast constraints with future Euclid data on cosmological parameters for different cosmological models, such as a time-varying dark energy component, phenomenological modifications of the perturbation sector and specific modified gravity models, with further extensions that include neutrino physics and the coupling to the electromagnetic sector through the fine-structure constant. We review the study of the impact of nonlinear clustering methods on beyond-$\\Lambda$CDM constraints with Euclid. This is of fundamental importance to efficiently predict the large-scale clustering of matter and dark matter halos, given that we will have access to a wealth of information on scales beyond the linear regime. We inspect the extension of theoretical predictions for observable quantities in alternative cosmologies to $\\Lambda$CDM at fully nonlinear scales by means of $N$-body simulations. We discuss the impact of relativistic corrections in extended cosmological models. Overall, this review highlights the significant potential of the Euclid mission to tightly constrain parameters of dark energy and modified gravity models, or perhaps to detect possible signatures of a $\\Lambda$CDM failure.",

On the other hand, such models offer greater flexibility to probe the DE sector in more detail. With the rapid advancement of astronomical surveys and the availability of diverse datasets, it is timely to examine whether current combined observations can effectively constrain an extended parameter space in DE models. This article investigates a four-parameter dynamical dark energy (DDE) model that spans a broad region of the universe's expansion history through four key parameters: the present-day value of the DE equation of state ($w_0$), its initial value ($w_m$), the scale factor depicting transition from $w_m$ to $w_0$ occurs ($a_t$), and the steepness of this transition ($\\Delta_{\\rm de}$). We constrain the model using CMB data from Planck, BAO from DESI DR2, and three distinct compilations of Type Ia Supernovae: PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3. Our results show that constraining all four parameters remains difficult: $a_t$ is not constrained by any dataset, while the remaining three parameters can be constrained only when all observational probes are combined (with the exception of DESY5). The results further show that DE has a quintessential nature at present ($w_0 > -1$), while $w_m$ is negative, indicating a phantom-like behaviour at early times. Interestingly, despite its larger parameter space, the proposed DDE model is preferred over the $\\Lambda$CDM scenario, based on both $\\Delta\\chi^2$ and Bayesian evidence, for certain combined datasets, particularly CMB+BAO+DESY5 and CMB+BAO+Union3.",

Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\\Gamma \\equiv \\log_{10}\\sqrt{G/G_{\\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\\rm N}>10^{-9}$m\\,s$^{-2}$, while it is $\\Gamma=0.134_{-0.036}^{+0.056}$ (thermal prior on eccentricity) or $0.115_{-0.028}^{+0.048}$ (flat prior) for 8 binaries with $g_{\\rm N}<10^{-9}$m\\,s$^{-2}$ representing $>3.7\\sigma$ discrepancy with Newton. Moreover, the inferred orbital true anomalies clearly favor modified gravity over Newton with the difference of Bayesian information criterion $>10$. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring and testing gravity at low acceleration with future samples of wide binaries.",

In the post-Friedmann expansion framework, a weak-field relativistic approximation purpose-built for cosmology, a frame-dragging gravito-magnetic vector potential arises at leading order, sourced by momentum currents, contributing to the metric even if the dynamics of matter fields at this order is Newtonian, and can thus be extracted from $N$-body simulations. Using the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator code on the IllustrisTNG simulations, here we extend previous work in order to compute the power spectrum of this vector potential down to galactic scales. The magnitude of the vector potential is two orders of magnitude larger than predicted by perturbation theory, and is a $1\\% \\sim 0.1\\%$ effect compared to the non-linear Newtonian scalar gravitational potential. In the red-shift range considered here, the gravito-magnetic effect remains subdominant, without showing any enhancement during a particular phase in the evolution of structures, aside from the continuous growth of non-linearity at low redshift. Although this seems to suggest that, within the $\\Lambda$CDM model, no significant gravito-magnetic effects contribute to the non-linear evolution of cosmic structures, i.e. to the dynamics of massive particles, possible observational consequences, e.g. in lensing, deserve further exploration.",

The internal structure of the intracluster medium (ICM) is tightly linked to the assembly history and physical processes in groups and clusters, but the role of recent accretion in shaping these profiles has not been fully explored. Aims. We investigate to what extent mass accretion accounts for the variability in ICM density and thermodynamic profiles, and what can present-day structures reveal about their formation histories. Methods. We analyze a hydrodynamical cosmological simulation including gas cooling but no feedback, to isolate the effects of heating from structure formation. Median profiles of ICM quantities are introduced as a robust description of the bulk ICM. We then examine correlations between mass accretion rates or assembly indicators with the profiles of temperature, entropy, pressure, gas and dark-matter density, as well as their scatter. Results. Accretion in the last dynamical time strongly lowers central gas densities, while leaving dark matter largely unaffected, producing a distinct signature in the baryon depletion function. Pressure and entropy show the clearest dependence on accretion, whereas temperature is less sensitive. The radii of steepest entropy, temperature, and pressure shift inward by $\\sim (10-20)\\%$ between high- and low-accretion subsamples. Assembly-state indicators are also related to the location of these features, and accretion correlates with the parameters of common fitting functions for density, pressure, and entropy. Conclusions. Recent accretion leaves measurable imprints on the ICM structure, highlighting the potential of thermodynamic profiles as diagnostics of cluster growth history.",

Ahmed 13 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ApJ Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present a dynamical analysis of galaxy clusters identified in the VIPERS spectroscopic survey within the redshift range 0.5 <= z <= 1.2. Cluster candidates were first detected as overdense regions in redshift space through the Finger-of-God (FoG) effect, and cluster membership was assigned using the GalWeight technique within the FoG-GalWeight methodology developed by our team. For each cluster, we derived the virial radius (R200), velocity dispersion (sigma200), and virial mass (M200) using the virial mass estimator. We identified ten VIPERS clusters spanning a mass range of 0.59 x 10^14 <= M200/(h^-1 Msun) <= 4.32 x 10^14 and velocity dispersions of 360 <= sigma200 <= 900 km s^-1. We cross-matched the VIPERS clusters with published catalogs and found at least one matching system for each cluster, offering external validation for our detections. We investigated the velocity dispersion-mass relation for these systems and obtained log(sigma200) = (2.73 +/- 0.06) + (0.36 +/- 0.18) log(M200), with an intrinsic scatter of sigma_int = 0.04 +/- 0.07. The derived relation is consistent with theoretical predictions from N-body and hydrodynamical simulations, confirming the reliability of the FoG-GalWeight methodology and the robustness of the virial mass estimator. Our findings demonstrate that the velocity dispersion can serve as a reliable and direct proxy for cluster mass, even at high redshift, without requiring additional dynamical mass modeling.",

However, detecting the 21cm signal is challenging due to the brighter foreground and associated observational difficulties. In this study, we evaluate the performance of various machine-learning regression models to improve parameter extraction and foreground removal. This evaluation is essential for selecting the most suitable machine learning regression model based on computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. We compare four models: Random Forest Regressor (RFR), Gaussian Process Regressor (GPR), Support Vector Regressor (SVR), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The comparison is based on metrics such as the root mean square error (RMSE) and $R^2$ scores. We examine their effectiveness across different dataset sizes and conditions, including scenarios with foreground contamination. Our results indicate that ANN consistently outperforms the other models, achieving the lowest RMSE and the highest $R^2$ scores across multiple cases. While GPR also performs well, it is computationally intensive, requiring significant RAM and longer execution times. SVR struggles with large datasets due to its high computational costs, and RFR demonstrates the weakest accuracy among the models tested. We also found that employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a preprocessing step significantly enhances model performance, especially in the presence of foregrounds.",

Despite this early prominence, no detailed lensing analyses have been carried out for more than fifteen years. We here study this cluster using JWST imaging obtained as part of the SLICE program, complemented by archival HST and X-ray observations. JWST data reveal ten new multiply imaged systems and enable the identification of conjugate substructures in several of the sixteen systems, significantly increasing the number of strong lensing constraints. Using these data, we construct a parametric mass model with Lenstool and extend it by explicitly incorporating the Chandra data in a combined strong lensing+X-ray fit. Our best-fit model reproduces the multiple images with an RMS of 0.4\" while simultaneously matching the X-ray data. The dark matter distribution is unimodal and centered on the brightest cluster galaxy, with a large core radius of 83+-5kpc, consistent with values reported in other strong lensing clusters. The strong lensing constraints require the inclusion of an external shear component which position angle points unambiguously towards a nearby (~1Mpc), well defined mass concentration at the same redshift in the North-West, for which we propose the naming AC114b. The spatial coverage of the XMM-Newton data encompasses the whole structure, allowing us to probe the X-ray properties of the companion cluster and the thermodynamics of AC114, providing evidence for a major merger, in line with previous signatures seen in Chandra, radio and optical spectroscopic data. Our results shed new light on the merging scenario, revealing a major merger caught in a late post-collisional phase, where AC114 is the dominant system and Ac114b has likely been stripped of its hot gas.",

Using the data set that includes DESI BAO (DR2), PantheonPlus SNe Ia, H(z) measurements, and BBN and the MCMC analysis, the key cosmological and model-specific parameters are constrained. The result is compared with that of the {\\Lambda}CDM model indicating that in addition to providing a viable dynamical dark energy framework, predictions for H(z) are slightly more consistent with intermediate-redshift observations. Generally, the model remains compatible with current data and offers testable deviations from {\\Lambda}CDM for upcoming surveys. It is also seen that when the energy density of quantum fields in vacuum, exposed by NTHDE, is combined with the Rastall correction term to the general relativity, a plausible candidate for dynamical dark energy is obtained that mimic the current value of the dark energy density parameter reported in the {\\Lambda}CDM model. The latter cannot be repeated by NTHDE alone. The study also confirms previous theoretical and observational constraints on the Rastall parameter obtained by focusing on the thermodynamics, early universe, pulsars, and the early-type galaxies.",

Jassal Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey have reignited the debate on the true nature of dark energy, challenging the standard cosmological constant model of cosmology. The results suggest a preference for dark energy to be dynamical rather than a cosmological constant. Several recent analyses of DESI data indicate that the universe's expansion may not be accelerating in the way suggested by supernova based cosmology. Motivated by these studies, we investigated a tachyon type scalar field $\\phi$ as a model for dark energy, assuming an exponential potential for the field and performed parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Such a model offers solutions that have $w \\sim -1$ and are decelerating without requiring a phantom like equation of state. The present day value of the equation of state parameter is treated as a free parameter; however, for the reference model, we fix its present value to $-1$. The analysis is carried out using the latest Supernovae dataset (Pantheon+) and BAO measurements from DESI. The results show that both types of datasets consistently predict a turnaround in the equation of state, regardless of whether $w_{\\phi 0}$ is treated as a free parameter or fixed to $-1$. The corresponding deceleration parameter also exhibits a future turnaround for both datasets when $w_{\\phi 0}$ is free. However, in the reference model with $w_{\\phi 0} = -1$, the deceleration parameter instead approaches $-1$ asymptotically. A model comparison using the Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria shows that the Pantheon+ dataset favors the free $w_{\\phi 0}$ scenario, while BAO observations prefer the $w_{\\phi 0} = -1$ case. This indicates a disagreement in the future evolution trends predicted by the two datasets within the tachyon type dark energy model.",

Yip, Gary Shiu Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We investigate the sensitivity of topological and traditional summary statistics to primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) using two suites of simulations. First, we introduce a new simulation suite for PNG, PNG-pmwd, comprising more than $20{,}000$ halo catalogs that vary individually local and equilateral shapes, together with variations in $\\Omega_m$ and $\\sigma_8$. Second, we carry out a systematic comparison of topological descriptors, as well as powerspectrum and bispectrum measurements, evaluating their constraining power on both local and equilateral $f_{\\rm NL}$ and how this sensitivity varies with halo mass. This dataset enables likelihood-free neural regression of $f_{\\rm NL}$ across multiple halo mass bins for a wide range of summary statistics. Third, we assess the transferability of these learned mappings by testing whether models trained on fast pmwd simulations can robustly infer on simulations from the QuijotePNG suite. We find that a combination of simple descriptive statistics of the topological features (PD-statistics) leads to the best performance to constrain equilateral PNG. We observe that the constraining power of these summaries comes from large-mass halos, with small-mass halos adding noise and degrading performance. Similarly, we find that the transferability of the learned mappings, for both topological and powerspectrum plus bispectrum, degrades if small scales or small-mass halos are included.",

Submitted to MNRAS and all comments welcomed Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Secondary anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) contain information that can be used to test both cosmological models and models of galaxy formation. Starting from lightcone-based HEALPix maps and catalogues, we present a new set of mock CMB maps constructed in a self-consistent manner from the FLAMINGO suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, including CMB lensing, thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects, cosmic infrared background, radio point source and anisotropic screening maps. We show that these simulations reproduce a wide range of observational constraints. We also compare our simulations with previous predictions based on dark matter-only simulations which generally model the secondary anisotropies independently from one another, concluding that our hydrodynamical simulation mocks perform at least as well as previous mocks in matching the observations whilst retaining self-consistency in the predictions of the different components. Using the model variations in FLAMINGO, we further explore how the signals depend on cosmology and feedback modelling, and we predict cross-correlations between some of the signals that differ significantly from those in previous mocks. The mock CMB maps should provide a valuable resource for exploring correlations between different secondary anisotropies and other large-scale structure tracers, and can be applied to forecasts for upcoming surveys.",

Taylor Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) In order to reach the required performance of Stage-III and IV weak lensing surveys, cosmic shear measurements have to rely on external simulations to calibrate residual biases. Over the years, several techniques have been developed to mitigate the impact of residual biases prior to calibration, including the inference of shear responses on images to correct multiplicative biases, and the empirical correction of additive biases. We introduce a novel methodology that generalises upon the state-of-the-art approaches by inferring multiplicative and additive biases jointly from parameterised distributions of measured ellipticities, crucially without relying on external simulations and independently from cosmology. Shear biases are marginalised over the unknown hyper-parameters in the modelling, hence mitigating the impact of degeneracies. We apply the technique to a representative problem and show the performance of the estimation, even in the presence of noise. The method has a high potential for applicability to the calibration of weak lensing cosmic shear in current and future lensing surveys.",

Yet, it remains unclear how feedback, through its connection to key galaxy properties, shapes the radial gas density profile in the host halo. We tackle this question using suites of the EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and Simba cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which span a variety of feedback models. We develop a random forest algorithm that predicts the radial gas density profile within haloes from the total halo mass and five global properties of the central galaxy: gas and stellar mass; star formation rate; mass and accretion rate of the central black hole (BH). The algorithm reproduces the simulated gas density profiles with an average accuracy of $\\sim$80-90% over the halo mass range $10^{9.5} \\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} < M_{\\rm 200c} < 10^{15} \\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ and redshift interval $0<z<4$. For the first time, we apply Sobol statistical sensitivity analysis to full cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, quantifying how each feature affects the gas density as a function of distance from the halo centre. Across all simulations and redshifts, the total halo mass and the gas mass of the central galaxy are the most strongly tied to the halo gas distribution, while stellar and BH properties are generally less informative. The exact relative importance of the different features depends on the feedback scenario and redshift. Our framework can be readily embedded in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to incorporate halo gas density profiles consistent with different hydrodynamical simulations. Our work also provides a proof of concept for constraining feedback models with future observations of galaxy properties and of the surrounding gas distribution.",

By stacking weak lensing signals from a large number of galaxies, we obtain average tangential shear profiles down to $\\sim 10\\,\\mathrm{kpc}/h$, which are fitted assuming a two-component model consisting of stellar and dark matter components to constrain their central dark matter distribution. We find a preference for non-zero core radii of dark matter distributions in galaxies with stellar masses of $\\sim 10^{11}M_\\odot$. Our results imply a stronger feedback effect than that typically predicted by current hydrodynamical simulations. In addition, we provide a new constraint on the stellar-to-halo mass relation, where both stellar and halo masses are, for the first time, directly constrained by weak gravitational lensing. Our results prefer the stellar initial mass function (IMF) that is more bottom-heavy than the Salpeter IMF.",

As key tracers of hierarchical structure formation, subhalos are among the most important objects within these simulations. In our previous work, we established that the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) can effectively extract clustering information and serve as a robust halo finder. Here, we extend the CWT framework to subhalo identification by adapting the CWTHF (Continuous Wavelet Transform Halo Finder) code. This extension extends the unbinding procedure, which enables the reliable identification of gravitationally bound substructures. The algorithm identifies density peaks within known halos or subhalos and segments the surrounding volume accordingly. Once a new subhalo is registered, its position is recorded to prevent duplicate detection. We validate our approach using the TNG50-2 and TNG100-1 simulations, as well as a single Friends-of-Friends (FOF) halo, by comparing the resulting CWT catalog against the reference SUBFIND catalog. Because the method inherits the original computational framework, our subhalo finder maintains a favorable linear time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(N)$.",

The effects of priors, including the so-called ''prior volume'' phenomenon have been originally studied in Ivanov et al. (2019) and subsequent works. In this note, we repeat and extend these tests and also apply them to other priors used in the literature. We point out that in addition to the ''prior volume'' effect there is a more dangerous effect that is largely overlooked: a systematic bias on cosmological parameters due to overoptimistic scale cuts. Unlike the ''prior volume'' effect, this is a genuine systematic bias due to two-loop corrections that does not vanish with better priors or with larger data volumes. Our study is based on the high fidelity BOSS-like PT Challenge simulation data which offer many advantages over analyses based on synthetic data generated with fitting pipelines. We show that some analysis choices associated with the PyBird code, especially the scale cuts, significantly bias parameter recovery, overestimating $\\sigma_8$ by over $5\\%$ (equivalent to $1\\sigma$). The bias on measured EFT parameters is even more significant. In contrast, the analysis choices associated with the CLASS-PT code lead to much smaller ($\\lesssim 1\\%$) shifts in cosmological parameters based on their best-fit values.",

Giri, Romain Teyssier, Tilman Tröster, Alexandre Refregier, Matthieu Schaller, Joop Schaye 43 pages, 18 figures, published version Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present an improved baryonification (BFC) model that modifies dark-matter-only $N$-body simulations to generate particle-level outputs for gas, dark matter, and stars. Unlike previous implementations, our approach first splits each simulation particle into separate dark matter and baryonic components, which are then displaced individually using the BFC technique. By applying the hydrostatic and ideal gas equations, we assign pressure and temperature values to individual gas particles. The model is validated against hydrodynamical simulations from the FLAMINGO and TNG suites (which feature varied feedback prescriptions) showing good agreement at the level of density and pressure profiles across a wide range of halo masses. As a further step, we calibrate the BFC model parameters to gas and stellar mass ratio profiles from the hydrodynamical simulations. Based on these calibrations, we baryonify $N$-body simulations and compare the resulting total matter power spectrum suppressions to the ones from the same hydrodynamical simulation. Carrying out this test of the BFC method at each redshift individually, we obtain a 2 percent agreement up to $k=5\\,h$/Mpc across all tested feedback scenarios. We also define a reduced, 2+1 parameter BFC model that simultaneously accounts for feedback variations (2 parameters) and redshift evolution (1 parameter). The 2+1 parameter model agrees with the hydrodynamical simulations to better than 2.5 percent over the scales and redshifts relevant for cosmological surveys. Finally, we present a map-level comparison between a baryonified $N$-body simulation and a full hydrodynamical run from the TNG simulation suite. Visual inspection of dark matter, gas, and stellar density fields, along with the integrated pressure map, shows promising agreement. Further work is needed to quantify the accuracy at the level of observables.",

Danielle Leonard, Markus Michael Rau, Cora Uhlemann, Shahab Joudaki Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Stage IV cosmological surveys will map the universe with unprecedented precision, reducing statistical uncertainties to levels where unmodelled systematics can significantly bias inference. In particular, photometric redshift (photo-z) errors and intrinsic alignments (IA) must be robustly accounted for to ensure accurate inference of cosmological parameters. The increasing depth of Stage IV surveys exacerbates these challenges by producing low signal-to-noise galaxy populations prone to inaccurate photo-z measurements. Catastrophically misidentified redshifts are especially problematic for 3$\\times$2pt inferences that combine weak lensing and galaxy clustering information. We demonstrate that even modest outlier fractions (e.g. 5%) can lead to substantial biases in cosmological parameter estimates: up to 1.8${\\sigma}$ in ${\\Omega}_M$ and ${\\sigma}_8$, and over 8${\\sigma}$ in the IA redshift evolution parameter ${\\eta}$. To address this, we introduce a flexible weighting scheme at the likelihood level that down-weights the most contamination-sensitive elements of the data vector during inference. This method mitigates biases without inflating the parameter space, reducing cosmological parameter biases to below 1${\\sigma}$ without substantially degrading constraining power. Our approach offers a practical solution for future analyses, enabling robust cosmological inference in the presence of catastrophic redshift errors.",

Observed at a redshift of z=5.39 and z=5.11 respectively, and with stellar masses of $\\rm 10^{9.6}M_\\odot$ and $\\rm 10^{9.5}M_\\odot$, GS-z5-Q1 and COS-z5-Q1 are two of the most distant quiescent galaxies spectroscopically confirmed to-date, and are by far the least massive ($\\sim10\\times$ lower mass). Full spectrophotometric modelling reveals that COS-z5-Q1 appears to have quenched more than 300Myr prior to observation ($z\\sim 7$) and has a formation redshift of around z$\\sim$11, whilst GS-z5-Q1 formed and quenched in a single burst around 150Myr prior to observation ($z\\sim6$). GS-z5-Q1 is found to lie near the centre of a known high-z overdensity in GOODS-S, as would be expected by galaxy formation models, while COS-z5-Q1 lies towards the outskirts of an overdense region. This highlights the role that environment could play in accelerating galaxy evolutionary processes and could possibly be linked to the galaxies' quiescent nature. By modelling their stellar populations, we show that these types of low-mass quiescent galaxies could potentially be descendants of the higher-z \"mini-quenched\" galaxies. The discovery of these two low-mass $z>5$ quiescent galaxies illuminates a previously undiscovered galaxy population and motivates dedicated follow-up surveys to investigate the overall population.",

Zanchettin 16 pages, 11 figures, submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present a comprehensive analysis of the nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) abundance ratio in star-forming galaxies at redshift z~1-6, with a median redshift of z=2.7, using deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy. Leveraging detections of faint auroral emission lines in 76 galaxies at z>1 from both the MARTA survey and a large compilation of high-redshift literature objects, we derive direct electron temperature-based abundances for nitrogen and oxygen using rest-frame optical lines. We establish the first high-redshift calibrations of strong-line N/O diagnostics based on direct abundance measurements, finding no significant evolution for either N2O2 = [NII]6585/[OII]3727,3729 and N2S2 = [NII]6585/[SII]6717,6731 diagnostics compared to local realisations. We then investigate the N/O-O/H relation across cosmic time using both direct abundances and strong-line based measurements (additional 430 galaxies). We find evidence for mild but systematic nitrogen enhancement at high redshift: galaxies at z>1 exhibit N/O ratios elevated by ~0.18 dex (median offset) at fixed O/H compared to the local relation, with a more pronounced enhancement at low metallicity (12+log(O/H) < 8.1) where the offset reaches up to ~0.3-0.4 dex. We consider several scenarios to explain the observed trends, including bursty star formation, differential metal loading, and inflows of pristine gas. Our results provide the most extensive confirmation of elevated N/O ratios at high-redshift to date based on rest-optical diagnostics and within a self-consistent frame.",

Accepted in Astronomy & Astrophysics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We investigate the presence and spatial characteristics of the jet base emission in M87* at 230 GHz, enabled by the enhanced uv coverage in the 2021 Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations. The addition of the 12-m Kitt Peak Telescope and NOEMA provides two key intermediate-length baselines to SMT and the IRAM 30-m, giving sensitivity to emission structures at scales of $\\sim250~\\mu$as and $\\sim2500~\\mu$as (0.02 pc and 0.2 pc). Without these baselines, earlier EHT observations lacked the capability to constrain emission on large scales, where a \"missing flux\" of order $\\sim1$ Jy is expected. To probe these scales, we analyzed closure phases, robust against station-based gain errors, and modeled the jet base emission using a simple Gaussian offset from the compact ring emission at separations $>100~\\mu$as. Our analysis reveals a Gaussian feature centered at ($\\Delta$RA $\\approx320~\\mu$as, $\\Delta$Dec $\\approx60~\\mu$as), a projected separation of $\\approx5500$ AU, with a flux density of only $\\sim60$ mJy, implying that most of the missing flux in previous studies must arise from larger scales. Brighter emission at these scales is ruled out, and the data do not favor more complex models. This component aligns with the inferred direction of the large-scale jet and is consistent with emission from the jet base. While our findings indicate detectable jet base emission at 230 GHz, coverage from only two intermediate baselines limits reconstruction of its morphology. We therefore treat the recovered Gaussian as an upper limit on the jet base flux density. Future EHT observations with expanded intermediate-baseline coverage will be essential to constrain the structure and nature of this component.",

Submitted to The Open Journal of Astrophysics. Comments welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a simple time-dependent model of viscously spreading accretion disks around black holes (BHs) with masses between $10-10^8M_\\odot$. We apply the results to observations of late-time emission in tidal disruption events (TDEs) and luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOT) such as AT2018cow. Our model generalizes previous work by incorporating outflows during super-Eddington accretion, non-conservation of mass and angular momentum in TDE circularization, irradiation of the outer disk by the inner accretion flow, and a range of viscous stress models. We show that many late-time plateaus in TDEs can be explained by disks formed with a large spread in angular momentum due to redistribution during circularization. Viscous spreading on year timescales is not required, although it is also compatible with the data. The collapse of radiation pressure dominated thin disks to the stable gas-pressure dominated phase greatly underpredicts TDE plateau luminosities, strongly favoring thermally stable magnetically dominated disk models. Irradiation of the outer disk in TDEs due to misalignment of the stellar orbit and black hole spin increases plateau luminosities and durations by factors of a few. Continued study of late-time TDE emission provides a unique opportunity to constrain the physics of disk formation and circularization, disk warps, angular momentum transport, and other poorly understood aspects of disk physics. The models we develop can also explain the late-time optical-UV emission in the LFBOT AT2018cow for BH masses of ~$10-100M_\\odot$. The faint X-ray emission at late times in AT2018cow is likely due to ongoing absorption. Our models predict that late-time X-rays should eventually be detectable again, and that HST/JWST observations of AT2018cow may detect a break in the SED at near-IR-optical wavelengths, providing a powerful probe of outer accretion disk thermodynamics.",

HEPRO-IX Conference High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) The variability of X-rays observed from accreting black hole systems, including quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), suggests a complex nonlinear dynamics in the corona. Here, we propose a new theoretical framework for this problem, based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. In this model, coronal variability arises from feedback between a macroscopic oscillation of the plasma and the rate at which it is cooled by the inverse Compton scattering of soft photons from the disc. The \"pair thermostat'' mechanism then allows the corona to act as a heat engine that extracts work cyclically from the underlying thermal disequilibrium between the low-entropy heating and the high-entropy cooling by the soft photons, in close analogy to the well-known $\\kappa$-mechanism for pulsating stars. This coronal self-oscillation may explain QPOs without the need to invoke an external resonant driving. Moreover, we argue that this mechanism can provide the power to generate turbulence and jets in the corona.",

Conselice, Nathan Adams, Roberto Cid Fernandes 9 pages, 5 figures, to be submitted High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate the host galaxy of the long gamma-ray burst GRB 230307A, which is associated with a kilonova candidate likely produced by a binary neutron-star (BNS) merger. The transient occurred at a projected offset of $\\sim 40$ kpc from its spiral-galaxy host. We consider two explanations for this large distance: (i) NSs that merge inside a remote globular cluster, or (ii) a BNS that formed in the disk whose orbit was strongly modified by the NS natal kicks. Using JWST data and comparisons with known globular clusters, we show that a globular-cluster origin is extremely unlikely, ruling out case (i). Considering case (ii), using JWST and MUSE data, we derive the host galaxy morphology, stellar mass, estimate the atomic gas (HI+He) contribution, and the host rotation curve. Assuming an NFW halo and applying Bayesian inference, we obtain a mass model for the host galaxy. From this model, we compute the time required for a disk-formed BNS, with a given natal kick, to reach the observed offset while marginalizing over uncertainties and over the initial position in the disk. We compare these results with BNS-merger simulations from the SEVN population-synthesis code combined with PARSEC stellar evolutionary tracks, which provide the coalescence time and kick velocity for each realization. The two approaches have an overlap in the kick-time diagram, but only 0.1\\% of the simulated systems fall within the 2$\\sigma$ region of the galaxy mass model. This indicates that a disk origin is possible, but requires fine-tuned conditions for the kilonova to occur at such a large distance from the host galaxy.",

The code used in the paper is available at this https URL Public outreach material related to this paper is available at this https URL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) An important diagnostic of the inner structure of accretion flows onto supermassive black holes are the stochastic flux variations at X-ray wavelengths. Despite its significance, a systematic characterisation of the statistical properties of the X-ray variability to the highest Eddington ratios and most massive black holes is still lacking. In this paper we address this issue using SRG/eROSITA 5-epoch light curves to characterise the mean X-ray variability of optically selected SDSS QSOs extending to black holes masses of $10^{10}$ solar and accretion rates close to the Eddington limit. The adopted variability statistic is the ensemble normalised excess variance, which is measured using a novel hierarchical Bayesian model (eBExVar) tailored to the Poisson nature of the X-ray light curves. We find a clear anti-correlation of the ensemble variability with black hole mass, extending previous results to time scales of months. This can be interpreted as evidence for an X-ray corona size and/or physical conditions that scale with black holes mass. We also find an unexpected increase of the ensemble normalised excess variance close to the Eddington limit, which is contrary to the predictions of empirical variability models. This result suggests an additional variability component for fast growing black holes that may be related to systematic variations of the hot corona size with Eddington ratio or shielding of the hot corona by an inner puffed-up disk and/or outflows.",

The underlying physical processes that produce the evolution of their X-ray emission and their long-lasting UV/optical plateau are well understood; however, the origin of their early-time optical/UV emission remains the subject of much debate and uncertainty. In this paper we propose and perform ``Calorimetric'' tests of published theories of these optical flares, contrasting theoretical predictions for the scaling of the radiated energy and peak luminosity of these flares with black hole mass (something which is predicted by each theory), with the observed (positive) black hole mass scaling. No one theory provides a satisfactory description of observations at all black hole mass scales. Theories relating to the reprocessing of an Eddington-limited compact accretion disk, or emission (energy) released in the formation of a Keplerian disk near the circularisation radius, perform best, but require extending. Models whereby the optical/UV flare are directly produced by shocks between debris streams (e.g., TDEmass), or the efficient reprocessing of the fallback rate (e.g., MOSFIT, or any other model in which $L \\propto \\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{fb}}$), are ruled out at high $(>5\\sigma)$ significance by the data.",

Even the narrow component of the line is resolved with evident Fe K$\\alpha_{1}$ (6.404 keV) and K$\\alpha_{2}$ (6.391 keV) contributions in a 2:1 flux ratio, fully consistent with a neutral gas with negligible bulk velocity. The narrow and intermediate-width components have a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of 350 $\\pm$ 50 km/s and $3510 \\pm 470 \\, \\rm km/s$, respectively, suggesting that they arise in the outer disk/torus and/or BLR. We detect a $10\\%$ excess flux around 4 $-$ 7 keV that is not well described by a symmetric Gaussian line, but is consistent with a relativistically broadened emission line. In this paper, we take the simplest approach to model the asymmetric line as a single emission line (assuming either neutral, He-like or H-like iron) convolved with a relativistic disk line model. As expected, the inferred inclination angle is highly sensitive to the assumed ionization state, and ranges between $i=17-44^{ \\circ}$. This model also constrains the black hole spin via the extent of the red wing: the required gravitational redshift in the fitted disk-line profile disfavors a non-spinning (Schwarzschild) black hole. The derived inner radius is close to the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit $r_{\\rm ISCO}$ and strongly correlated with the black hole spin. To better constrain the spin, we fix the inner radius at $r_{\\rm ISCO}$ and derive a lower limit on the spin of $a \\ge 0.29$ at the 3 $\\sigma$ confidence level.

Meyers Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal, 25 pages, 9 Figures, 4 Tables High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an) Radio emission from pulsars is known to exhibit a diverse range of emission phenomena, among which nulling, where the emission becomes temporarily undetectable, is an intriguing one. Observations suggest nulling is prevalent in many long-period pulsars and must be understood to obtain a more comprehensive picture of pulsar emission and its evolution. One of the limitations in observational characterisation of nulling is the limited signal-to-noise, making individual pulses often not easily distinguishable from noise or any putative faint emission. Although some of the approaches in the published literature attempt to address this, they lose efficacy when individual pulses appear indistinguishable from the noise, and as a result, can lead to less accurate measurements. Here we develop a new method (the $\\mathbb{N}$sum algorithm) that uses sums of pulses for better distinguishability from noise and thus measures the nulling fraction more robustly. It can be employed for measuring nulling fractions in weaker pulsars and observations with a limited number of observed pulses. We compare our algorithm with the recently developed Gaussian Mixture Modelling approach, using both simulated and real data, and find that our approach yields consistent results for generic and weaker pulsars. We also explore quasi-periodicity in nulling and measure the related parameters for five pulsars, including PSRs~J1453$-$6413, J0950$+$0755 and J0026$-$1955, for which these are also the first such measurements. We compare and contrast our analysis of quasi-periodic nulling with previously published work and explore the use of spin-down energy loss ($\\dot E$) to distinguish between different types of modulation behaviour.",

It is eclipsed for 42% of its orbit at 888 MHz, and multi--frequency image--domain observations show that the egress duration scales with frequency as a power law with index $n = -1.74$, where longer duration eclipses are seen at lower frequencies. An optical counterpart is detected in archival Gaia data within $0.5''$ of the radio position. It has a mean G-band magnitude of 18.8 mag and its light curve displays characteristics consistent with a combination of ellipsoidal modulation and irradiation effects. We also report the nearest Fermi $\\gamma$-ray source, located 2$'$ away from our source, as a possible association. A radio timing study constrains the intrinsic and orbital properties of the system, revealing orbital period variations that we attribute to changes in the gravitational quadrupole moment of the companion star. At the eclipse boundary, we measure a maximum dispersion measure excess of $2.0 \\pm 1.2 \\ \\mathrm{pc\\ cm^{-3}}$, corresponding to an electron column density of $5.9 \\pm 3.6 \\times10^{18} \\ \\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. Modelling of the eclipse mechanism suggests that synchrotron absorption is the dominant cause of the eclipses observed at radio wavelengths. The discovery and characterisation of systems like \\psr\\ provide valuable insights into pulsar recycling, binary evolution, the nature of companion-driven eclipses, and the interplay between compact objects and their plasma environments.",

The data analysis incorporates simultaneous and quasi-simultaneous observations from Swift-XRT and NuSTAR. Our results reveal a significant detection of X-ray polarization in the 2--6 keV band at a confidence level (CL) of 6.6$\\sigma$, with a polarization degree of $\\Pi_{\\rm X}=17.9\\%\\pm2.7\\%$ and an electric vector position angle (EVPA) of $\\psi_{\\rm X}=10^\\circ.0\\pm4^\\circ.4$. An even higher polarization degree of $\\Pi_{\\rm X}=38.9\\%\\pm9.1\\%$ with an EVPA of $\\psi_{\\rm X}=13^\\circ.9\\pm6^\\circ.7$ is observed within a narrower time interval, at a CL of 4.3$\\sigma$. During the IXPE observational campaign, the X-ray spectrum of 1ES 1101--232 exhibits a clear soft-to-hard spectral evolution in the 0.3--10 keV band, although no significant flux variability is detected. Additionally, a clockwise hysteresis loop is identified in the flux--photon index plane. These findings collectively indicate that the X-ray emission from 1ES 1101--232 originates in a region characterized by a well-ordered magnetic field through synchrotron radiation.",

Patra (SOA Univ.), Sudhanwa Patra (IIT Bhilai and IOP BBSR) 7 page, 4 figures, regular article High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) The fundamental character of a fermionic dark matter, whether it is a Dirac or Majorana particle remains a key unresolved issue whose answer would profoundly affect dark-sector phenomenology and detection strategies thereby motivates complementary probes across particle and astrophysical experiments. Compact stars, particularly neutron stars, offer unique astrophysical laboratories for probing such fundamental properties under extreme densities. The presence of a fermionic DM admixed with nuclear matter can modify the equation of state, thereby affecting observable quantities such as the mass-radius (M-R) relation and tidal deformability. In this work, we investigate how the intrinsic particle nature of fermionic DM influences neutron star structure. Within a relativistic mean-field framework extended by a scalar (or Higgs like) portal coupling between DM and nucleons, we construct self-consistent equation of states for both Dirac and Majorana cases and solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to obtain stellar configurations. Owing to the difference in internal degrees of freedom, Dirac DM (four degrees of freedom) generally softens the equation of state more strongly than Majorana DM (two degrees of freedom), leading to smaller radii and lower maximum masses. We identify the parameter space consistent with current NICER and gravitational-wave constraints, highlighting the potential of compact-star observations to discriminate between Dirac and Majorana dark matter.",

Tingay, Callan M. Wood, Alexandra Tetarenko, Tyrone N. O'Doherty, Valeriu Tudose In the final stages of review with Nature Astronomy. 47 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Jets provide an important channel for kinetic feedback from accreting black holes into their environment, without which models of the formation of large-scale structure in the universe fail to reproduce the observed properties of galaxies. Hence, an accurate measurement of jet power is critical for understanding black hole growth through accretion and also for quantifying the impact of kinetic feedback. However, the absence of instantaneous jet power measurements has precluded direct comparisons with the accretion luminosity, forcing kinetic feedback models to rely on ad hoc assumptions about how much jet power is released per accreted amount of mass. Here we report the detection of stellar wind-induced bending of the jets in the black hole X-ray binary Cygnus X-1, using 18 years of high-resolution radio imaging. By modeling jet-wind interactions, we determine the current kinetic instantaneous power of the jet to be log$_{10}(L_{\\rm jet}/{\\rm erg\\,s}^{-1}) = 37.3_{-0.2}^{+0.1}$, comparable to the accretion energy determined from its bolometric X-ray luminosity. This result critically places prevailing assumptions about the energetics of black hole powered jets in both galaxy formation simulations, and in scaling models of black hole accretion, on a firm empirical footing.",

Miller Jones, Susmita Sett, Kristen Dage, Jay Strader, Timothy J.

Recently, identification of fast-moving stars in the core of $\\omega$ Cen provided the strongest evidence to date for the presence of such an IMBH. One of the key questions in the study of IMBHs is their accretion efficiency, which determines their radio and X-ray signatures. We investigate the accretion signature of the IMBH in $\\omega$ Cen with ultra-deep radio continuum observations of the central region of the cluster. Using approximately 170 hours of Australia Telescope Compact Array observations, we achieve a root mean square noise of 1.1 $\\mu$Jy at 7.25 GHz, making this the most sensitive radio image of the cluster to date. We detect no radio emission at any of the proposed centers of the cluster, imposing stringent constraints on the presence of an accreting IMBH in $\\omega$ Cen. Considering the fundamental plane of black hole activity, our findings indicate that the accretion efficiency around the black hole is exceptionally low (with a conservative 3-$\\sigma$ upper limit of $\\epsilon \\lesssim 4\\times10^{-3}$).",

By modeling proton injection, the study explores how the acceleration of protons in massive star clusters contributes to the gamma radiation detectable from Earth. The analysis focuses on two primary types of clusters: widespread, dispersed clusters and younger, compact massive clusters, both of which host shock waves generated by supernova remnants (SNR). Clusters located near the solar system, within a 3-kiloparsec radius,are identified. Analytical methods are used to calculate energy spectra and gamma-ray production rates. The findings suggest that young and compact MSC contribute to multi-TeV to PeV gamma-ray emission, with the dominant contribution arising from nearby populations.",

Here, a simplified method is proposed to test such repeating pTDEs scenario considering a main-sequence star tidally disrupted twice. For the two flares in AT 2020vdq if related to the repeating pTDEs scenario, theoretical TDE model determined stellar mass of the original star disrupted for the first flare should be not very different from the mass of the star (to trace the reminder of the original star) disrupted for the second flare, because a partial TDE with impact parameter $\\beta$ smaller than 1 can lead to most of (probable higher than 90\\%) the stellar mass also bound to the reminder of the original star. After considering theoretical TDE model applied to describe the two flares in AT 2020vdq, the model determined stellar masses are about 2${\\rm M_\\odot}$ and $0.36{\\rm M_\\odot}$ for the stars disrupted in the first flare and the second flare. The large mass difference cannot be reasonably expected by the repeating pTDEs with $\\beta$ around 0.6 in AT 2020vdq. The results in this manuscript indicate that the repeating pTDEs scenario is not preferred at current stage in AT 2020vdq, but the probable double TDEs for two individual stars tidally disrupted should be currently recommended.",

Accepted by Astronomy and Astrophysics Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) An extensive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up campaign of the Type IIb SN 2022ngb is presented in the article. Through detailed modeling of this dataset, we aim to constrain the key physical parameters of the explosion, infer the nature of the progenitor star and its environment, and probe the dynamical properties of the ejecta. We analyze photometric and spectroscopic data of SN 2022ngb. By constructing and modeling the bolometric light curve with semi-analytic models, we estimate the primary explosion parameters. The spectroscopic data are compared with those of well-studied SNe IIb and NLTE models to constrain the properties of the progenitor and the structure of the resulting ejecta. SN 2022ngb is a low-luminosity SN IIb with a peak bolometric luminosity of L_bol = 7.76 (+1.15/-1.00) x 10^41 erg/s and a V-band rising time of 24.32 +/- 0.50 days. Light curve modeling indicates an ejecta mass of ~2.9-3.2 M_sun, an explosion energy of ~1.4 x 10^51 erg, and a low synthesized 56Ni mass of ~0.045 M_sun. Nebular phase spectra exhibit asymmetric line profiles, pointing to a non-spherical explosion and an anisotropic distribution of radioactive material. Our analysis reveals a relatively compact stripped-envelope progenitor with a pre-SN mass of approximately 4.7 M_sun (corresponding to a 15-16 M_sun ZAMS star). Our analysis suggests that SN 2022ngb originated from the explosion of a moderate-mass relatively compact, stripped-envelope star in a binary system. The asymmetries inferred from the nebular phase spectral line features suggest a non-spherical explosion.",

The formation of terrestrial planets in our solar system was strongly influenced by the radioactive decay heat of short-lived radionuclides (SLRs), particularly $^{26}$Al, likely delivered from nearby supernovae. However, current models struggle to reproduce the abundance of SLRs inferred from meteorite analysis without destroying the protosolar disk. We propose the `immersion' mechanism, where cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis in a supernova shockwave reproduces estimated SLR abundances at a supernova distance ($\\sim$1 pc), preserving the disk. We estimate that solar-mass stars in star clusters typically experience at least one such supernova within 1 pc, supporting the feasibility of this scenario. This suggests solar-system-like SLR abundances and terrestrial planet formation are more common than previously thought.",

However, they are hampered by the unresolved origin of stellar Fe K{\\alpha} lines: i.e., it is unclear which of the two mechanisms-photoionization by hard X-ray photons or collisional ionization by non-thermal electrons-is the dominant process. We present clear evidence for the photoionization origin based on simultaneous far ultraviolet (FUV) and soft X-ray observations of a superflare on the RS Canum Venaticorum-type Star UX Arietis with Extreme ultraviolet spetrosCope for ExosphEric Dynamic (EXCEED; 900$-$1480 Å) onboard Hisaki and Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER; 0.2$-$12 keV).

The FUV emission, a proxy for non-thermal activity, peaked approximately 1.4 hours before the soft X-rays. In contrast, the Fe K{\\alpha} line, detected at a statistical significance of $5.3 \\sigma$ with an equivalent width of $67^{+28}_{-20}$ eV, peaked simultaneously with the thermal X-ray maximum rather than the non-thermal FUV peak-strongly supporting the photoionization hypothesis.

Rankine, Elias Kammoun, Catarina Aydar, Mara Salvato, Andrea Merloni, Mirko Krumpe 18+4 pages, 12+6 figures, Published at MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The X-ray--to--UV relation of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), commonly parametrized via the monochromatic luminosities at $2500\\,\\mathring{A}$ and $2\\,keV$, reflects the energetic interplay between the accretion disc and the X-ray-emitting corona, and is key for understanding accretion physics. Previous studies suggest that disc-dominated emission becomes more prominent with increasing optical luminosity. However, the redshift evolution of this relation remains debated, and a dependence on Eddington ratio, predicted by accretion flow models, is still observationally unconstrained. We revisit this relation using a large, nearly all-sky sample by combining the SDSS DR16Q QSO catalogue with X-ray data from XMM-Newton and the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey DR1, yielding 136,745 QSOs at redshifts $0.5 \\leq z < 3.0$. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian framework that treats X-ray detections and upper limits uniformly, enabling robust inference from both parametric and non-parametric models. We confirm a tight, sublinear $\\log L_X({\\rm 2\\,keV})$-$\\log L_{\\nu}({\\rm 2500\\,\\mathring{A}})$ correlation, but with a normalization at the lower end of previous estimates. Contrary to most literature results, we detect a mild but systematic redshift evolution: the relation flattens and its intrinsic scatter decreases at higher redshift. This trend is consistent with disc emission increasingly dominated by scattering and enhanced energy transfer to the X-ray corona, potentially indicating redshift evolution in the X-ray bolometric correction. We find no significant dependence on Eddington ratio, in tension with recent accretion flow models.",

D High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most powerful electromagnetic outbursts in the Universe and emit a vast amount of their energy in the form of gamma rays. Their duration is extremely short on cosmic timescales, but they show a wealth of time variability in their light curves. Properties of this variability may carry information about the processes the gamma rays emerge from, which are still poorly understood. This research investigates the redshift-corrected gamma-ray light curves of 159 long GRBs, observed with the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor on the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope between 2008 and 2023. We calculate the average power-density spectrum (PDS) of different groups of GRBs that are distinguished based on fluence, peak rate, duration, redshift, and the different GRB phases. Almost all redshift-corrected spectra reveal a power-law behavior with high-frequency power-law indices distributed around $\\sim -1.9 \\pm 0.2$. The precursor phase and redshift-corrected short bursts exhibit a shallower power law with index $\\sim -1.30 \\pm 0.04$, potentially due to the limited statistics that these samples represent. Only in some cases, the high-frequency index is still consistent with the $-5/3$ (Kolmogorov) slope, found by earlier studies and linked to the appearance of fully developed turbulence.",

Data files available in Zenodo High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th) Four neutron star radius measurements have already been obtained by modeling the X-ray pulses of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER). We report here the radius measurement of PSR J0614-3329 employing the same method with NICER and XMM-Newton data using Bayesian Inference. For all different models tested, including one with unrestricted inclination prior, we retrieve very similar non-antipodal hot regions geometries and radii. For the preferred model, we infer an equatorial radius of $R_{\\rm eq}=10.29^{+1.01}_{-0.86}\\,$km for a mass of $M=1.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07} \\, M_{\\odot}$ (median values with equal-tailed $68\\%$ credible interval), the latter being essentially constrained from radio timing priors obtained by MeerKAT. A more complex model, fitting the data equally well, resulted in a consistent inferred radius. We find that, for all different models, the pulse emission originates from two hot regions, one at the pole and the other at the equator. The resulting radius constraint is consistent with previous X-ray and gravitational wave measurements of neutron stars in the same mass range. Equation of state inferences, including previous NICER and gravitational wave results, slightly soften the equation of state with PSR J0614$-$3329 included and shift the allowed mass-radius region toward lower radii by $\\sim 300\\,$m, which is compatible with previous analyses to within less than one standard deviation.",

Recent advances in radio interferometry, particularly with MeerKAT, have enabled the localisation of individual bursts with arcsecond precision. In this work, we present the localisation of 15 apparently non-repeating FRBs detected with MeerKAT. Two of the FRBs, discovered in 2022, were localised in 8 second images from the projects which MeerTRAP was commensal to, while eight were localised using the transient buffer (TB) pipeline, and another one through SeeKAT, all with arcsecond precision. Four additional FRBs lacked TB triggers and sufficient signal, limiting their localisation only to arcminute precision. For eight of the FRBs in our sample, we identify host galaxies with greater than 90% confidence, and one with 80% confidence, while two FRBs have ambiguous associations. We measured spectroscopic redshifts for six host galaxies, ranging from 0.33 to 0.85, demonstrating MeerKAT's sensitivity to high redshift FRBs. We modelled the spectral energy distributions of host galaxies with sufficient photometric coverage to derive their stellar population and star formation properties. This work represents one of the largest uniform samples of well-localised distant FRBs to date, laying the groundwork for using MeerKAT FRBs as cosmological probes and understand how FRB hosts evolve at high redshift.",

By segmenting the light curves into increasing and decreasing trends, we analyze each segment independently, allowing for precise measurements of both the periodicity and long-term variations. To interpret these QPOs, we explore various theoretical scenarios that could explain their origin and underlying physical mechanisms. The variability observed in 4C~+31.03 is more consistent with a stochastic process, whereas the periods estimated for MG1~J123931+0443 and PKS~1622$-$253 align with the precessional dynamics expected from binary supermassive black hole systems.

Among host properties, gas-phase metallicity is a key factor influencing stellar evolution and transient productions. We analyze the largest uniformly selected sample of FRB host galaxies, measuring oxygen abundances (12+log(O/H)=8.04-8.85) for 31 hosts at redshifts z=0.04-0.98, using consistent emission-line diagnostics. Using a volume-limited subsample, we compare the distributions of stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and metallicity to a control sample of star-forming galaxies selected by the same criteria. We find that FRB host galaxies span a wide metallicity range and are broadly consistent with the SFR-weighted mass-metallicity relation of star-forming galaxies. We find no clear lower metallicity bound, suggesting that FRB progenitors can form in any metallicity environment through channels largely insensitive to metal abundance. Encouragingly, this implies FRBs can arise even in low-metallicity, high-redshift galaxies, supporting their potential as probes of matter distribution across cosmic time. Additionally, we find marginal ($\\sim$2$\\sigma$) evidence for a -0.09\\pm0.04 dex metallicity offset from the fundamental metallicity relation. Despite model uncertainties, if real, this offset likely reflects suppressed SFRs at fixed mass and metallicity rather than metal deficiency. Similar offsets are observed in local post-merger galaxies and may reflect a post-starburst phase following galaxy interactions. Such systems may host FRB progenitors formed during the starburst that produce FRBs after a 100-500 Myr delay, broadly consistent with observed delay-time distributions, although further data are needed to confirm this interpretation.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Understanding the coronal geometry in different states of black hole X-ray binaries is important for more accurate modeling of the system. However, it is difficult to distinguish different geometries by fitting the observed Comptonization spectra. In this work, we use the Monte Carlo ray-tracing code MONK to simulate the spectra for three simple corona toy models widely proposed in observational studies: sandwich, spherical, and lamppost, varying their optical depth and size (height). By fitting the simulated NuSTAR observations with the simplcut*kerrbb model, we infer the possible parameter space for the hard state and soft state of different coronal geometries. The influence of the disk inclination angle, black hole spin and coronal temperature is discussed. We find that in the lamppost model, if we exclude the case of a very extended corona, the disk emission is always dominant, making the lamppost geometry incompatible with the hard state. While the sandwich and spherical models can produce similar spectra in both the hard and soft states, the simulated IXPE polarimetric spectra show the potential to break this degeneracy. Geometrical effects arising from the limited size of the corona become evident in lower-spin black holes and affect the spectral fitting, where the larger ISCO reduces the corona coverage of the inner disk.",

EC-SNe are predicted to be the most likely short-lived and faint optical transients, and a small ejecta mass is expected during the collapse. This kind of SNe provide an alternative channel for producing isolated NSs and NS systems, especially for the formation of X-ray binaries and double NSs. Although EC-SNe were proposed ~45 yr ago, there are still some uncertainties for the origin of EC-SNe. In this article, we review recent studies on the two classic progenitor channels of EC-SNe, i.e., the single star channel and the binary star channel. In the single star channel, EC-SNe can happen in super asymptotic giant branch stars or He stars, whereas in the binary star channel EC-SNe can occur in He stars in binaries (involving He star+MS systems and NS+He star systems) or accretion-induced collapse in white dwarf binaries (involving the single-degenerate scenario and the double-degenerate scenario). Recent progress on the two progenitor channels is discussed, including the initial parameter range for EC-SNe, the evolutionary paths to EC-SNe, related objects and some observational constraints, etc. We also make some discussions on the possible candidates for EC-SNe in this article, and the impacts of EC-SNe on some research fields, e.g., the properties of NSs, double NS population and chemical products, etc. We also discuss the differences between EC-SNe and ultra-stripped SNe in this article. Research on EC-SNe is at a pivotal stage, with key theoretical uncertainties and observational challenges requiring integrated modeling and multi-wavelength observations for robust identification.",

However, accurate mass outflow rate measurements are challenging due to uncertainties in our understanding of the 3D wind structure. Most studies employ absorption line spectroscopy that only gives us a single sightline through the wind streamlines. Hercules X-1 is a peculiar X-ray binary which allows us to avoid this issue, as its warped, precessing accretion disk naturally presents a range of sightlines through the vertical structure of its disk wind. Here we present the first results from a large, coordinated campaign on Her X-1 led by the new XRISM observatory (with an exposure of 210 ks) and supported by XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and Chandra. We perform a time-resolved analysis and constrain the wind properties. With XRISM/Resolve, we directly detect the Her X-1 orbital motion with an amplitude of 170 km/s in the evolution of the wind velocity. After correcting for this effect, we observe an increase in wind velocity from 250 km/s to 600 km/s as the wind rises to greater heights above the disk. The wind column density decreases with increasing height, as expected, but its ionization parameter log($\\xi$/erg cm s$^{-1}$) evolves only weakly from 3.65 to 3.9 as the wind expands away. Additionally, we detect a new orbital dependence of the wind properties, revealing a likely second component that appears only briefly after the eclipse by the secondary star.",

Understanding their luminosity function and formation rate is crucial for elucidating their nature. Recently, the EP team has provided the latest catalog of EP-detected FXTs. Based on this catalog, we present a model-independent nonparametric approach to derive the luminosity function and formation rate of FXTs. Our analysis reveals significant cosmological luminosity evolution, characterized by a scaling relationship of $(1+z)^{3.58}$. After accounting for this evolution, we establish that the local luminosity function is best represented by a broken power law, with a break luminosity of $(4.17 \\pm 0.34) \\times 10^{46}$ erg/s. The formation rate exhibits a broken power law as $\\rho(z) \\propto (1+z)^{-4.25}$ at $z \\lessapprox 0.9$ and $\\rho(z) \\propto (1+z)^{-0.26}$ at $z \\gtrapprox 0.9$, yielding a local rate of approximately $153.8_{-95.1}^{+249.4}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$.

Previous kinetic studies by particle-in-cell simulations have demonstrated that when maximum CR energy is near the injection scale, NRH instability efficiently amplifies magnetic field up to the saturation level. However, the efficiency of NRH instability goes down as maximum energy increase since CR current is carried by escaping CRs near the maximum energy. We employ a one-dimensional MHD--CR framework solving telegraph-type diffusion--convection equations to trace the coupled evolution of CRs, magnetic fields, and shock dynamics under realistic parameters. We find a distinct transition with magnetic field strength: for weak background fields ($B_{0}\\!\\lesssim\\!10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{G}$), NRH instability efficiently amplifies upstream turbulence, driving a self-regulated state where $E_{\\max}$ becomes independent of initial strength of magnetic turbulence. In contrast, for stronger background fields ($B_{0}\\!\\gtrsim\\!10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{G}$), the escaping CR current is too weak to drive NRH instability, and magnetic turbulence further decays through parametric instabilities, potentially reducing the acceleration efficiency. We give the physical interpretation for the transition and discuss conditions for PeV--EeV acceleration at UFO reverse shocks.",

Mahlmann, Alexander Philippov, Siddhant Solanki, Arno Vanthieghem, Muni Zhou High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) Entity is a new-generation, fully open-source particle-in-cell (PIC) code developed to overcome key limitations in astrophysical plasma modeling, particularly the extreme separation of scales and the performance challenges associated with evolving, GPU-centric computing infrastructures. It achieves hardware-agnostic performance portability across various GPU and CPU architectures using the Kokkos library. Crucially, Entity maintains a high standard for usability, clarity, and customizability, offering a robust and easy-to-use framework for developing new algorithms and grid geometries, which allows extensive control without requiring edits to the core source code. This paper details the core general-coordinate special-relativistic module. Entity is the first PIC code designed to solve the Vlasov-Maxwell system in general coordinates, enabling a coordinate-agnostic framework that provides the foundational structure for straightforward extension to arbitrary coordinate geometries. The core methodology achieves numerical stability by solving particle equations of motion in the global orthonormal Cartesian basis, despite using generalized coordinates like Cartesian, axisymmetric spherical, and quasi-spherical grids. Charge conservation is ensured via a specialized current deposition technique using conformal currents. The code exhibits robust scalability and performance portability on major GPU platforms (AMD MI250X, NVIDIA A100, and Intel Max Series), with the 3D particle pusher and the current deposition operating efficiently at about 2 nanoseconds per particle per timestep. Functionality is validated through a comprehensive suite of standard Cartesian plasma tests and the accurate modeling of relativistic magnetospheres in curvilinear axisymmetric geometries.",

Motivated by this finding, we selected a different type of blazar, the flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) 3C~279, which hosts a QSC at an angular median distance of 0.35~mas from the radio core, as revealed by 27 years of VLBA monitoring data at 15~GHz. We investigate the positional scatter and dynamics of a QSC in the 3C~279 jet, aiming to detect the presence of a relativistic transverse wave and estimate its characteristics. We employ an analytical statistical method to estimate the mean intrinsic speed of the QSC, while moving average and refinement methods are used to smooth its trajectory. Analysis of the QSC position scatter shows that the jet axis change its direction by about $21^{\\circ}$ over 27 years and jet mean intrinsic full opening angle is $\\approx 0.30^{\\circ} \\pm 0.03^{\\circ}$. The apparent displacement vectors of the QSC exhibit strong asymmetry and anisotropy along the jet direction, indicating pronounced anisotropic displacements of the core along the jet axis. We estimated the mean intrinsic speed of the QSC to be superluminal, $\\overline{\\beta_{\\rm s}} \\approx 10$ in units of the speed of light, which, within the framework of the seagull-on-wave model, is interpreted as evidence for a relativistic transverse wave propagating through the QSC. Analysis of the reversing trajectory of the QSC enables the classification and characterisation of reversal patterns, which, in turn, allows the determination of key transverse wave parameters such as frequency, amplitude, inclination angle, and magnetic energy of the wave (abbrev.).",

The nebula exhibits a nested bipolar morphology, including inner and outer shells, faint outer lobes, and polar knots. Remarkably, all these components share a dynamical age of order 10,000 yr. Thermal broadening of the H alpha line relative to heavier ions implies a hydrogen temperature 3000 K to 6000 K, in contrast to the ~ 10,000 K derived from collisionally excited line diagnostics. This provides independent support for the presence of at least two distinct temperature/metallicity phases, as previously proposed to explain extreme abundance discrepancies. Photoionization models with sinusoidally varying metallicity successfully reproduce the observed nebular spectrum and morphology. A mixture of fluctuations with both extreme and moderate metallicity contrasts is required to simultaneously fit the O II and the [O III] observations. The nebular He II emission demands a hotter and more luminous central star than previously inferred, consistent with a ~ 0.58 solar mass post-AGB progenitor evolving toward a CO white dwarf. Ou 5 thus reinforces the link between close-binary nuclei and extreme abundance discrepancies, and provides a valuable benchmark for understanding how common-envelope ejections give rise to the thermal and abundance inhomogeneities observed in planetary nebulae.",

Jones, Isabella Lamperti, Jan Scholtz, Bartolomeo Trefoloni, Giacomo Venturi 22 pages, 13 figures, Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Understanding the physical conditions and feedback mechanisms in early massive galaxies is essential to uncover how they formed and evolved during the first billion years of the Universe. In this context, the galaxy EGSY8p7/CEERS-1019 at z=8.6 provides an excellent benchmark, given its stellar mass of $10^{9.3}M_\\odot$ and elevated N/O abundance despite its sub-solar metallicity. In this study, we present new JWST/NIRSpec observations offering the first spatially resolved spectroscopy of this galaxy, with higher sensitivity and spectral resolution than previous studies. We identify broad (FWHM=650km/s) H$\\beta$ and [OIII] emission components whose emission is located between the two rest-frame UV clumps of the galaxy and extended over a distance of $\\sim1kpc$. The morphology and kinematics of these components indicate that the broad emission arises from outflowing gas rather than from an AGN broad-line region. The kinetic energy injection rate from stellar feedback is an order of magnitude higher than that of the outflow, while the radiation pressure rate is comparable to the outflow momentum rate. These results suggest that stellar feedback alone can drive the outflow, with radiation pressure potentially providing the required momentum transfer. We derive a low mass-loading factor ($\\eta=0.16$) and ionizing photon escape fraction ($f_{esc}=0.021\\pm0.014$). Together with the high electron density measured ($n_e=2200cm^{-3}$), these results support the interpretation that most of the gas remains confined within the galaxy. Comparisons of diagnostic emission-line ratios with photoionization and shock models support a star-formation-driven ionization scenario, ruling out any excitation by AGN radiation. Finally, the absence of detectable Wolf-Rayet features suggests that alternative mechanisms must be considered to explain the high N/O ratio in this galaxy.",

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Radial migration and dynamical heating redistribute stars within galactic discs and thereby modify the chemo-kinematic structure of their host galaxies. Usually, these secular processes are studied in N-body and hydrodynamical simulations of Milky Way analogues with stellar-dominated discs. In contrast, discs at high redshift are gas-rich, which may qualitatively change how secular evolution proceeds. We use the Nexus framework to construct and evolve a suite of isolated galaxies with fixed halo and disc mass but varying initial disc gas fraction, from 0% to 100%. We show that in gas-rich models, the root-mean-square change in stellar angular momentum is up to a factor of two larger than in gas-poor analogues and is accompanied by stronger radial and vertical heating, leading to enhanced radial mixing. We further dissect the role of gas in specific migration channels. For bar-driven migration, corotation resonance dragging dominates in gas-poor discs, whereas in gas-rich discs, stars more readily reach and accumulate at the outer Lindblad resonance, which acts as a barrier. The high radial mixing efficiency in gas-rich phases can flatten the stellar metallicity gradient relative to that of the initial gaseous disc within only a few orbital timescales. Together, these results imply that radial mixing in early, gas-rich discs is substantially more vigorous than in late-time, gas-poor discs, naturally producing distinct evolutionary tracks for chemically bimodal discs such as that of the Milky Way.",

Comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Lyman alpha (LyA) line of neutral hydrogen plays a central role in observations of star-forming galaxies. However, resonant scattering makes it difficult to directly interpret LyA signatures. Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) calculations have become the gold standard for modeling LyA, but it becomes extremely computationally expensive in optically thick environments. Workarounds, such as core-skipping to avoid repetitive low-transport scatterings, greatly increase the efficiency of MCRT simulations but introduce errors in the solutions. While core-skipping is designed to preserve emergent spectra, the internal radiation field, most importantly, the momentum imparted, is not properly preserved. On the other hand, to make analytical and numerical progress, it is often assumed that photons diffuse in both frequency and physical space. We find that these diffusion approximations break down for frequencies near the core and positions at finite optical depths. We propose a more physically-motivated definition for the core-wing transition frequency to isolate such effects. We derive new spectral distributions of internal radiation properties and compare the results with simulations. We analyze the diffusive properties of LyA photons and demonstrate anomalous spatial diffusion behavior with fat-tailed distributions. This work deepens our understanding of diffusion in resonant-line transfer and identifies areas where simulations or analytics may be failing and how these failures may be resolved.",

Code used to produce figures and animation available at this https URL. Submitted to ApJ. Comments welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Spectroscopic datasets are essential for training and calibrating photometric redshift (photo-$z$) methods. However, spectroscopic redshifts (spec-$z$'s) constitute a biased and sparse sampling of the photometric galaxy population, which creates difficulties for the common grid-based approach for mapping color to redshift using self-organizing maps (SOMs). Instead, we utilized the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) algorithm to compress a Rubin-Roman-like $ugrizyJH$ color space into a thin and densely-sampled manifold. Crucially, the manifold varies continuously and monotonically in redshift and specific star formation rate in roughly orthogonal directions. Using $\\sim$110,000 COSMOS2020 many-band photo-$z$'s and $\\sim$15,000 spec-$z$'s as representative and non-representative samples, respectively, we trained and tested redshift estimation from a SOM (SOM-$z$) and from nearest neighbors in UMAP space (UMAP-$k$NN-$z$). Compared to SOM-$z$, UMAP-$k$NN-$z$ exhibited smaller photo-$z$ scatter and fraction of outliers for the representative training set. When training with the highly biased spec-$z$ sample, UMAP-$k$NN-$z$ maintained similar performance, but the outlier fraction for SOM-$z$ increased by nearly three times. The physically-meaningful trends across the UMAP manifold allow for accurate redshift regression even in regions of color space sparsely populated by spectroscopic objects, which comprise nearly 25% of the photometric sample. This suggests that representative, spectroscopically-anchored training sets can be produced by interpolating between spectroscopic sources at the UMAP coordinates of photometric objects, maximizing the performance of photo-$z$ algorithms.",

For our study, we use Galactic Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder H I Survey data and produce H I emission and absorption cubes on 7 pc scales. To examine the CNM structures toward 30 Dor, we decompose the H I absorption cube into 862 Gaussian components and find that these components are distributed at four velocity ranges (B1, B2, B3, and B4, respectively): 200$-$230 km s$^{-1}$, 230$-$260 km s$^{-1}$, 260$-$277 km s$^{-1}$, and 277$-$300 km s$^{-1}$. We derive line-of-sight average spin temperatures and opacity-corrected total H I column densities and show that the B1$-$B4 structures have systematically different properties, indicating that they are physically distinct. As for the nature of the observed CNM structures, we find that B2 is associated with the main dense structure where ionized, atomic, and molecular gases are concentrated. B3 and B4 trace inflows whose combined mass flux rate of 0.14 $M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ is comparable to the current star formation rate, while B1 probes outflows with a much lower mass flux rate of 0.007 $M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Interestingly, the H I column densities in B1$-$B4 are nearly uniform with a factor of two spatial variations, implying the presence of H I shielding layers for H$_{2}$ formation.",

High-quality archival imaging enables quantitative morphological measurements -- including disk inclination and position angle -- for every galaxy, providing a robust framework for assessing how absorber strength depends on the geometric alignment between galaxies and the QSO sightlines. All galaxies have associated constraints on MgII lambda 2796 absorption, and a subset of 56 galaxies also have measurements of CaII lambda 3934. We compare rest-frame MgII and CaII equivalent widths with both projected distance and deprojected galactocentric distance. Across the full sample, we find no statistically significant correlation between absorption strength and azimuthal angle. Restricting to the 71 galaxies with well-determined disk orientations reveals a mild excess of strong MgII absorbers near the projected major axis, but a Kendall's tau test confirms that this trend is not statistically significant. CaII absorption, which exhibits a low covering fraction of kappa_CaII = 0.18^{+0.06}_{-0.04} within 50 kpc for W_r(3934) > 0.1 Ang, shows no measurable azimuthal dependence. To assess potential biases, we quantify the effects of projection, disk inclination, and variations in imaging quality. After accounting for these systematics, the spatial distribution of low-redshift MgII and CaII absorbers is consistent with arising from a randomly distributed population, with no compelling evidence for azimuthal anisotropy at d <~ 50 kpc. A larger sample with robust constraints on the disk orientation will be required to uncover or rule out subtle anisotropic trends.",

By leveraging the full six dimensional phase space information (positions and velocities), we apply the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to blindly identify stellar overdensities in the Galactocentric Cartesian velocity space (U, V, W ). Our unsupervised machine learning approach successfully recovers the kinematic cores of major local moving groups, including the Hyades and Pleiades streams, without prior assumptions regarding their membership or spatial distribution. We analyze the velocity dispersion and structural properties of these associations, demonstrating that automated clustering algorithms are robust tools for mapping the complex dynamical history of the local Milky Way disk. These results confirm the hierarchical nature of stellar kinematic substructures and provide a catalog of high-probability members for future spectroscopic follow-up.",

Jimenez-Serra Accepted for publication in ACS Earth and Space Chemistry (Eric Herbst Festschrift) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Isotopic fractionation is a very powerful tool to follow the evolution of material from one stage to the next in the star-formation process. Pre-stellar cores exhibit some of the highest levels of deuteration because their physical conditions greatly favor deuteration processes. Deuteration maps are a measure of the effectiveness of the deuteration across the core, and they are useful to study both the deuteration as well as the formation mechanism of the main species. Methanol is the simplest O-bearing complex organic molecule (COM) detected in the interstellar medium (ISM). It represents the beginning of molecular complexity in star-forming regions, thus a complete understanding of its formation and deuteration is a necessary step to understand the development of further chemical complexity. In this paper, we use single-dish observations with the IRAM 30 m telescope and state-of-the-art chemical models to investigate the deuteration of methanol towards the prototypical pre-stellar core L1544. We also compare the results of the chemical models with previous observations of deuterated methanol towards the pre-stellar cores HMM1 and L694-2. The spectra extracted from the CHD$_2$OH map show that the emission is concentrated in the center and towards the north-west of the core. Using deep observations towards the dust and the methanol peaks of the core, we derive a very large deuterium fraction for methanol ($\\sim20\\%$) towards both peaks. The comparison of our observational results with chemical models has highlighted the importance of H-abstraction processes in the formation and deuteration of methanol. Deep observations combined with state-of-the-art chemical models are of fundamental importance in understanding the development of molecular complexity in the ISM. Our analysis also shows the importance of non-LTE effects when measuring the D/H ratios in methanol.",

Pentericci, B. Perez-Diaz, B. Stoyanova, T. Treu Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed an unexpected excess of UV-bright galaxies at z>10, unaccounted for by extrapolations from pre-JWST observations and theoretical models. Understanding the physical properties and star formation histories (SFH) of high redshift systems is key to distinguish between the different proposed scenarios. We identify and analyse a sample of 2420 robust candidates at z~7-14 drawn from the ASTRODEEP-JWST dataset over ~0.2 deg^2 and model their properties with non-parametric SFHs to derive their specific star formation rate (sSFR) and stellar population properties. We find that the median sSFR and M/L remain roughly constant across the probed redshift range. We show that this result is robust against potential systematics unless a hidden population of dust-enshrouded starbursts, undetectable in current data, exists at these redshifts. In any case, the absence of observed high-sSFR systems at the highest redshifts suggests that any dust-free starburst phase must be short-lived. The observed sSFR evolution is in tension with most (though not all) theoretical models, making it a key quantity for discriminating among competing scenarios. The sample shows a wide range of physical conditions and galaxy classes, including systems with low sSFR and high mass-to-light ratios (M/L) up to z~10, indicative of already evolved galaxies only a few hundred Myr after the Big Bang, and different degrees of dust attenuation. We finally attempt to reconstruct the assembly histories of two sub-samples: a) the highest-M/L galaxies at z~7-8, which appear to have formed the bulk of their stars at least 500 Myr before observation, implying progenitors observable as UV-bright sources at z>20, and b) z>11 galaxies, which formed through stochastic SFH, remaining UV-faint for most of their early evolution, before undergoing recent (~50 Myr old) episodes of major growth.",

Privon, Gurtina Besla, Kelsey E. Johnson, Nitya Kallivayalil, David R. Patton, Mary Putman, David Simpson Heil 17 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We report on the HI content of an isolated, compact group of 6 dwarf galaxies at a distance of 145 Mpc. The distribution and kinematics of the HI, including multiple gaseous bridges, indicate the group is a gravitationally bound system. The HI maps further reveal two newly discovered dwarf satellites easily identified by their gas but only barely visible in optical images. The four dwarf group members previously identified in SDSS have 9.06 < log(Mstar/Msun) < 9.43 and 9.42 < log(MHI/Msun) < 9.73. The two newly discovered dwarf satellites have log(Mstar/Msun) = 6.10 with log(MHI/Msun) = 8.71 and log(Mstar/Msun) = 7.07 with log(MHI/Msun) = 9.18. New Gemini optical spectra link the HI detections and their optical counterparts. The group's 3D velocity dispersion (188 km/s), mass-to-light ratio (M_L/B ~44), dynamical-to-baryonic mass ratio (Mdyn/Mbary ~ 21), size (69 kpc), and gas fraction (0.56) are all consistent with the compact dwarf groups in the TNG50 simulation. The group has a top-heavy satellite mass function that is inconsistent with predictions for LMC-sized hosts and may instead be two or more groups coming together. A Voronoi tessellation reveals the group resides in a tendril outside the intersection of two filaments. These intermediate density environments within large scale structure provide the conditions needed for groups of star forming, gas-rich dwarf galaxies to form and eventually merge. Our results further show that it is possible to uncover fainter dwarf satellites around dwarf galaxy hosts via HI maps.",

Santos, Catherine Cress, Daniel J.B. Smith, Catherine Hale, José Afonso, Imogen H. Whittam, Mattia Vaccari, Ian Heywood, Shuowen Jin, Fangxia An Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Deep radio continuum surveys provide fundamental constraints on galaxy evolution, but source confusion limits sensitivity to the faintest sources. We present a complete framework for producing high-fidelity deblended radio catalogs from the confused MIGHTEE maps using the probabilistic deblending framework XID+ and prior positions from deep multi-wavelength data in the COSMOS field. To assess performance, we construct MIGHTEE-like simulations based on the Tiered Radio Extragalactic Continuum Simulation (T-RECS) radio source population, ensuring a realistic distribution of star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) for validation. Through these simulations, we show that prior catalog purity is the dominant factor controlling deblending accuracy: a high-purity prior, containing only sources with a high likelihood of radio detection, recovers accurate flux densities and reproduces input source counts down to $\\sim 3\\sigma$ (where $\\sigma = $ thermal noise). On the other hand, a complete prior overestimates the source counts due to spurious detections. Our optimal strategy combines the high-purity prior with a mask that removes sources detected above $50~\\mu$Jy. Applied to the $\\sim$1.3\\,deg$^2$ area of the MIGHTEE-COSMOS field defined by overlapping multi-wavelength data, this procedure yields a deblended catalog of 89,562 sources. The derived 1.4\\,GHz source counts agree with independent P(D) analyses and indicate that we resolve the radio background to $\\sim 4.8\\,\\mu$Jy. We also define a recommended high-fidelity sample of 20,757 sources, based on detection significance, flux density, and goodness-of-fit, which provides reliable flux densities for individual sources in the confusion-limited regime.",

We conduct the statistical analyses on the structural parameters with clusters' ages and locations within the Milky Way. Our results reveal the higher concentration in the cluster centeris associated with the sharper truncation at the periphery of cluster, which is consistent with previous findings for globular clusters(GCs). We further find the systematic increase of the lower limit of clusters' half-mass radius (Rh) with age. Our results also show that OCs located at larger vertical distances from the Galactic plane systematically display higher central concentrations. Our findings collectively suggest that the structural characteristics of OCs are shaped by both intrinsic evolutionary processes and interactions with the Galactic environment. During the evolution of star clusters, the combined effects of mass segregation and tidal stripping lead to the systematic pattern between central concentration and outer truncation. Clusters of different ages and locations within the Milky Way undergo different evolutionary histories, resulting in correlations between the Rh and age, as well as between central concentration and galactic location.",

Gieser, S. Li, D. Semenov, I. Skretas, M.R.A. Wells 16 pages, 14 figures, accepted for A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Aims. We investigate the role of filaments in high-mass star formation, whether gas flows from large to small scales along them, and what their properties might reveal about the region they are found in. Methods. The Max Planck IRAM Observatory Program (MIOP), the Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments (CASCADE), includes high spatial resolution (~3'') data of HCO+(1-0) and H13CO+(1-0) emission in the star-forming DR20 region in the Cygnus X complex. In this data we identify filaments with the structure identification algorithm DisPerSE. We further analyze these filaments using Gaussian fits to the spectra to determine the line peak velocity and full width half maximum along them. The Python package FilChaP was used to determine filament widths. Results. We find projected velocity gradients inside several filaments between 0.4 to 2.4km/s over projected length-scales of 0.1pc toward star-forming cores. This can be interpreted as a sign of gas flowing along the filaments toward the cores. The filament width distributions exhibit median values between 0.06 and 0.14pc depending on the core, the tracer, and the method. Standard deviations are approximately 0.02 to 0.06pc. These values are roughly in agreement with the filament width of 0.1pc typically found in nearby low-mass star-forming regions. Conclusions. This first analysis of filamentary properties within the Cygnus X CASCADE program reveals potential signatures of gas flows along filaments onto star-forming cores. Furthermore, the characteristics of the filaments in this high-mass star-forming region can be compared to those of filaments in low-mass star-forming regions typically studied before. Extending such studies to the entire CASCADE survey will enhance our knowledge of high-mass filament properties on solid statistical grounds.",

However, stars in these regions are faint, crowded, and have high extinction, which makes studying their formation and evolution challenging. Using the integral-field spectrograph MUSE with adaptive-optics on the Very Large Telescope, we overcome these limitations and measure accurate ages, chemical abundances, and line-of-sight velocities for 98 main-sequence turn-off and subgiant branch stars with $R_{gc}<3.5$ kpc in Baade's Window. We find that 17% stars have ages younger than 5 Gyr, and the age distribution reveals multiple peaks at 3.1, 4.8, 7.6, and 10.8 Gyr, indicating that star formation in the inner Galaxy occurred in multiple episodes. These stars are predominantly metal-rich but span a broad metallicity range ($-1.2<$[Fe/H]$<+0.6$). The [$\\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution shows both $\\alpha$-rich and $\\alpha$-poor sequences, with most stars being metal-rich and low-[$\\alpha$/Fe].

However, it is still unclear that how strongly the fragmentation process is affected by the properties of the host clumps, and how these properties influence the core distribution observed in recent millimeter (mm) and sub-mm observations. To systematically investigate this relation, we employed MHD simulations of convergent flows to generate a large sample of clumps and analyzed their properties using various techniques. Alignment parameters were used to quantify core distribution, while energy terms were calculated to assess the influence of gravity, magnetic fields, and turbulence. We found the core distribution only exhibiting weak correlations between alignment parameters and clump properties. For an individual clump, turbulence is believed to significantly contribute to these features by inducing non-homologous collapse and ongoing fragmentation. Nevertheless, for the entire population, more compact core distributions are observed due to the dominance of gravity. Overall, these factors suggest that clump properties are not sufficient to accurately determine core distribution.",

J. Gwyn Accepted by the Astrophysical Journal (ApJ) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present a kinematical study of the outer halo (r_GC approximately 60 to 160 kpc) of the Milky Way based on spectroscopy of 55 RR Lyrae stars obtained with the ESI instrument on the Keck II telescope. Our spectroscopic targets were selected from three photometric surveys: NGVS, DES, and Pan-STARRS1. We derive center-of-mass radial velocities with uncertainties of 6 to 35 km s^-1. The halo velocity dispersion measured from our sample is 70 plus/minus 7 km s^-1. The velocity field shows a possible dipole-like structure, with redshifted northern and blueshifted southern hemispheres. Fitting a Milky Way - Large Magellanic Cloud dipole perturbation model yields a weak or marginal dipole signal with amplitude -30 (+16, -20) km s^-1 and apex direction (l, b) = (-38.2 (+42.4, -31.5), -41.3 (+27.9, -23.8)) deg, along with a bulk compression velocity of -16 plus/minus 11 km s^-1. Although limited by sky coverage and sample size, our results are consistent with the presence of LMC-induced disequilibrium in the distant halo beyond 100 kpc. In addition to the 55 RR Lyrae stars, our spectroscopy reveals that 10 additional photometrically selected RR Lyrae candidates are actually quasar or blazar contaminants, highlighting the need for caution regarding such contaminants in sparsely sampled photometric surveys. Our study demonstrates that single-epoch spectroscopy of RR Lyrae stars is a viable method for probing the kinematics of the outer halo, and future surveys such as Rubin LSST and DESI-II have the potential to significantly advance this effort.",

Feuillet, Steve Kraemer, Anna Trindade Falcão, Valentina Braito, Marcio Meléndez, Henrique R. Schmitt, James N. Reeves, Riccardo Middei, Travis C. Fischer, Mitchell Revalski 20 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables. Accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) AGN winds play an important role in the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, yet their driving mechanisms and impact on star formation remain subjects of active investigation. Critically, the lack of X-ray Integral Field Units currently limits our ability to acquire spatially resolved velocity information in the X-ray regime. However, instead, this can be achieved using the James Webb Space Telescope. As part of an ongoing investigation of the nuclear feedback processes in the nearby luminous AGN NGC 7469, we present an analysis of the kinematics of the X-ray emitting outflows using near-infrared footprint lines such as [Mg VIII] 3.03 um. These high-ionization emission lines are associated with the same gas analyzed in the X-ray, and thus can be used to probe the footprint of the X-ray wind's velocity structure and ionization state. Thanks to the wide wavelength range available with JWST we also use nebular (e.g. [S IV] 10.51 um) and coronal (e.g. [Ne V] 14.32 um) emission lines to offer a comprehensive multi-phase view of the outflows. We present mass and kinetic energy outflow rates, and find that while the feedback processes in NGC 7469 are not efficient by theoretical benchmarks, the most massive and energetic component is the high ionization X-ray gas.",

NGC 1266 is an excellent case study for investigating the outflows and star formation quenching because it is a nearby (D\\sim30 Mpc) AGN host galaxy with an outflow driving shocks through the interstellar medium (ISM) and has recently quenched its star formation outside the nucleus. While previous works have studied the molecular outflow from its CO emission, to fully characterize the impact the outflow has on the ISM observations probing the dense, cold gas are necessary. Our ALMA cycle 0 observations do not detect a molecular outflow in 13CO(2-1) and yield a lower limit 12CO/13CO \\geq 250, suggesting a highly optically thin CO outflow with low 13CO abundance. In contrast, we detect substantial HCN(1-0) emission in the outflow, with an HCN(1-0)/12CO(1-0) ratio of 0.09, consistent with global measurements of many star-forming galaxies and Luminous InfraRed Galaxies (LIRGs). We conclude that the CO emission traces a diffuse component of the molecular gas with a low optical depth, whereas the HCN(1-0) traces dense clumps of gas entrained in the outflow. We measure an upper limit molecular outflow rate of < 85 Msun/yr. Assuming the ongoing nuclear star formation and outflow continue at the same rates, NGC 1266 will deplete its gas reservoirs in 450 Myr or longer, indicating that relatively low-level AGN feedback is capable of gradually expelling the molecular gas reservoir after a rapid quenching event.",

As such, they enable the acquisition of otherwise inaccessible information about nascent extrasolar systems. The discovery of the third interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, provides an opportunity to explore the properties of a small body from another solar system and to compare it to the small bodies in our own. To that end, we present spectrophotometric observations of 3I/ATLAS taken using the SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph on the University of Hawaii 2.2-m telescope. Our data includes the earliest $\\lambda\\leq3800$ A spectrum of 3I/ATLAS, obtained $\\sim$12.5 hours after the discovery announcement. Later spectra confirm previously reported cometary activity, including Ni and CN emission. The data show wavelength-varying spectral slopes ($S\\approx($0\\%-29\\%)/1000 A, depending on wavelength range) throughout the pre-perihelion ($r_h=4.4$-$2.5$ au) approach of 3I/ATLAS. We perform synthetic photometry on our spectra and find 3I/ATLAS shows mostly stable color evolution over the period of our observations, with $g-r$ colors ranging from $\\sim$0.69-0.75 mag, $r-i$ colors ranging from $\\sim$0.26-0.30 mag, and $c-o$ colors ranging from $\\sim$0.50-0.55 mag. Ongoing post-perihelion observations of 3I/ATLAS will provide further insight into its potentially extreme composition.",

Given a proper calibration, well covered optical and near-infrared photometry, as well as radial velocity curves, it allows for estimation of distances to individual pulsating stars and determination of their mean radii. The technique is fully empirical and does not depend on stellar atmosphere models. The goal of the work is to test the precision of distance determinations to individual RR Lyrae stars and to their host system as a whole using the IRSB technique for a relatively distant globular cluster M 3 (NGC 5272). We also aim to determine mean radii and period-radius relations for these stars in order to compare them with the existing theoretical prediction and empirical estimations for the field stars from the solar neighborhood. We use data available in the literature and the calibration of the IRSB technique based on the RR Lyrae stars from the solar neighborhood we published previously in order to determine distances to 14 RR Lyrae stars in the globular cluster M 3. We study the impact of the selection of the fitting procedure (bisector v.s. the LS fit) on the results. We apply five different empirical surface brightness-color relations from the literature in the analysis. We obtained a mean distance to M 3 of $r_{M3} = (10.07 \\pm 0.19 \\pm 0.29) \\,kpc$ that corresponds to a distance modulus ${\\mu}_{M3} = (15.015 \\pm 0.041 \\pm 0.063) \\,mag$ and a $7\\%$ scatter of individual stellar distances for 14 RR Lyrae stars in M 3. We received a very good agreement between the two fitting techniques. We also determined mean stellar radii for pulsators from the sample with a precision of $0.5\\%$ and obtained excellent agreement with a theoretical prediction of the period-radius relation for RRab stars available in the literature.",

In each case, the planetary nature was revealed through distinct types of anomalies in the lensing light curves: a positive bump near the peak for KMT-2024-BLG-0176, an asymmetric peak for KMT-2024-BLG-0349, a short-duration central dip for KMT-2024-BLG-1870, and a caustic-crossing feature for KMT-2024-BLG-2087. Detailed modeling of the light curves confirms that these anomalies are produced by planetary companions with planet-to-host mass ratios in the range of $(1.5\\text{--}17.9)\\times 10^{-3}$. Despite the diversity of signal morphologies, all planets detected in these events are giant planets with masses comparable to or exceeding that of Jupiter in the Solar System. Each planet orbits a host star less massive than the Sun, emphasizing the strength of microlensing in uncovering planetary systems around low-mass stellar hosts.",

Aerts Accepted for publication in A&A, 11+4 pages, 7+3 Figures, 2 Tables Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Due to their proximity, the Pleiades are an important benchmark open cluster. Despite its status, asteroseismic analyses of its members are rare. In particular, the gravity-mode (g-mode) pulsators, which allow inference of stellar near-core properties have not been analysed yet. We aim to identify and analyse the population of g-mode pulsators in the Pleiades. Our focus lies on the internal rotation as measured from asteroseismology to obtain a well defined sample of stellar rotation on the early main sequence. Based on full-frame images from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we constructed light curves for intermediate-mass Pleiades members and searched for g-mode pulsators among them. For pulsators exhibiting period spacing patterns, we determined their near-core rotation rate and buoyancy periods. For all other g-mode pulsators, we estimated the near-core rotation rate based on the dominant mode frequency to obtain a comprehensive rotation rate distribution. Among our 105 target stars, we find 28 g-mode pulsators distributed across the entire upper main sequence, 19 of which are hybrid pulsators, but only three stars exhibit period spacing patterns in the current TESS data. The near-core rotation rates in A- and early F-type members are distributed between 1 and 3 d$^{-1}$ without any clear mass-dependence. This distribution is much broader than the one in the similar open cluster NGC 2516. A comparison of the buoyancy periods shows that the Pleiades and NGC 2516 are of similar asteroseismic age. With the large population of g-mode and hybrid pulsators, the Pleiades constitute a valuable asteroseismic benchmark cluster, reaffirming its important role in stellar astrophysics.",

Using a parameter scan and phenomenological analysis of maximally-simplified three-dimensional cartesian magnetohydrodynamic simulations of large-scale nonlinear helical turbulent dynamos, I present results in this Letter that strongly point to an asymptotic ultimate regime of the large-scale solar dynamo, at large magnetic Reynolds numbers $Rm$, involving helicity fluxes between hemispheres. I obtained corresponding numerical solutions at both $Pm>1$ and $Pm<1$, and show that they can currently only be achieved in clean, simplified numerical setups. The analysis further strongly suggests that all global simulations to date lie in a non-asymptotic turbulent MHD regimes highly sensitive to changes in kinetic and magnetic Reynolds numbers. Ideas are presented to attempt to reach this ultimate regime in such \"realistic\" global spherical models at a reasonable numerical cost. Overall, the results clarify the current state, and some hard limitations of the brute-force numerical modelling approach applied to this, and other similar astrophysical turbulence problems.",

Because magnetic diffusion is usually much faster than system evolution, ancient fields cannot explain the present magnetization of planets, stars, and galaxies. Instead, self-sustaining dynamos, which convert fluid motion into magnetic energy, offer the most robust explanation. Numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations are essential to understanding this phenomenon. This thesis uses numerical models of self-excited dynamos in two contexts: the interstellar medium (ISM) and the interiors of gas giant planets. First, I use 3D MHD simulations with the Pencil Code to study magnetic growth from irrotational, subsonic expansion flows, a simplified representation of supernova-driven motions in the ISM. These curl-free flows mimic stellar explosions and winds, drive turbulence, and seed magnetic amplification. The second part examines planetary dynamos. I outline the properties of planetary magnetic fields and their modeling through convection in spherical shells. Although many exoplanets are known, their magnetic fields remain difficult to detect, but may be observable through coherent radio emission with new low-frequency instruments. Using 3D dynamo simulations with the MagIC code, coupled to thermodynamic profiles from MESA-based evolution models, I study the magnetic evolution of cold gas giants. The models show a slow decline in field strength, a shift from multipolar to dipolar states, and clear evolutionary trends in dynamo behavior. I also investigate hot Jupiters, where strong irradiation alters convection and rotation. Most remain fast rotators, but massive, distant planets may enter different regimes. When heating is concentrated in outer layers, convection in the dynamo region weakens, reducing expected field strengths and helping explain the absence of confirmed detections in past radio surveys.",

Phillips, Masayuki Akiyama, Junya Arita, Masatoshi Imanishi, Takuma Izumi, Nobunari Kashikawa, Toshihiro Kawaguchi, Satoshi Kikuta, Kotaro Kohno, Chien-Hsiu Lee, Tohru Nagao, Ayumi Takahashi, Yoshiki Toba Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The unprecedented sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a surprisingly abundant population of mildly obscured, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the epoch of reionization (EoR). However, the link between these objects and classical unobscured quasars remains a mystery. Here we report the discovery of obscured quasars hosted by the most luminous galaxies at z > 6, possibly bridging the gap between the two AGN populations. The 13 objects presented here were originally selected from a rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) imaging survey over >1000 deg2, and were known to have luminous (>10^{43} erg/s) narrow Ly-alpha emission. With JWST/NIRSpec follow-up observations, we found that 7 out of 11 objects with narrow Ly-alpha exhibit a broad component in H I Balmer lines and He I lines, but not in [O III] and other forbidden lines. Mild dust obscuration (0 < Av < 3) is inferred from the Balmer decrements. The estimated intrinsic luminosities suggest that our broad line (BL) objects are the long-sought UV-obscured counterparts of luminous quasars in the EoR. They host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses 10^(7.8-9.1) Msun, undergoing sub-Eddington to Eddington accretion. Most of the BL objects are spatially unresolved, and are close to \"little red dots\" with their blue rest-UV and red rest-optical colors. We estimate the AGN number density among similarly luminous Ly-alpha emitters to be larger than 2 x 10^(-8) /Mpc3. This density is comparable to that of classical quasars with similar continuum luminosities, suggesting that a substantial fraction of active SMBHs are obscured in the EoR and have been overlooked in past rest-UV surveys.",

Enßlin, Gordian Edenhofer Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Recent 3D dust maps of the local Milky Way are revolutionizing our understanding of the Sun's Galactic neighborhood, bringing much-needed insight into the large-scale organization of the interstellar medium. Focusing on the largest scales in $\\textit{Gaia}$-based 3D dust maps, we find a pattern of seven highly elongated, mostly parallel structures in the local $5\\,\\mathrm{kpc}^2$, five of which were previously unknown. These structures show pitch angles of $33.5 \\pm 4.0 ^\\circ$, and masses ranging from $10^5$ to $10^6$ $\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. We refer to these structures as superclouds. Nearly all known star-forming regions in the solar neighborhood lie within the superclouds, primarily along their central axes, supporting the idea that they are precursors to giant molecular clouds. All but one of the seven superclouds show an underlying undulation, indicating that this is not a property unique to the Radcliffe wave. We find that while the superclouds have line masses that vary by about a factor of four, their volume densities vary by about $10\\%$ only. This suggests that superclouds self-regulate their physical sizes and internal structure to maintain pressure equilibrium with their environment. These findings establish a new framework for understanding how large-scale Galactic structures shape the conditions for star formation in the solar vicinity, and likely in galaxies like the Milky Way.",

Davis Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) In our previous paper, we developed an orbit-superposition method for edge-on barred galaxies and constructed a set of dynamical models based on different mock observations of three galaxies from the Auriga simulations. In this study, we adopted 12 cases with side-on bars (three simulated galaxies, each with four different projections). We decomposed these galaxies into different structures combining the kinematic and morphological properties of stellar orbits. We then compared the model-predicted components to their true counterparts in the simulations. Our models can identify (BP/X-shaped) bars, spheroidal bulges, thin discs, and spatially diffuse stellar halos. The mass fractions of bars and discs are well constrained with absolute biases of $|f_{\\rm model}-f_{\\rm true}|\\le0.15$. We recovered the mass fractions of halos with $|f_{\\rm model}-f_{\\rm true}|\\le0.03$. For the bulge components, 10 out of 12 cases exhibit $|f_{\\rm model}-f_{\\rm true}|\\le0.05$, while the other two cases exhibit $|f_{\\rm model}-f_{\\rm true}|\\le0.10$. Then, by tagging the stellar orbits with ages and metallicities, we derived the chemical properties of each structure. For the stellar ages, our models recovered the negative gradients in the bars and discs, but exhibited relatively larger uncertainties for age gradients in the bulges and halos. The mean stellar ages of all components were constrained with absolute biases $|t_{\\rm model}-t_{\\rm true}|\\rm\\lesssim1\\,Gyr$. For stellar metallicities, our models reproduced the steep negative gradients of the bars and bulges, as well as all different kinds of metallicity gradients in the discs and halos. Apart from the bulge in the simulated galaxy Au-18, the mean stellar metallicities of all other components were constrained with absolute biases of $|Z_{\\rm model}-Z_{\\rm true}|\\rm\\le0.5\\,Z_{\\odot}$.",

Deuterated molecular ions therefore emerge as key tracers because deuterium fractionation is enhanced at low temperatures. We present the first direct observation of ortho-H2D+ depletion in the prestellar core G205.46-14.56M3 using ALMA 820um continuum and ortho-H2D+(110-111) data at ~300-au resolution. We confirm the previously reported two substructures, B1 and B2, and identify a central ortho-H2D+ depletion zone toward B1 with ~6$\\sigma$ contrast and an inferred diameter $\\lesssim$600au, together with a peak $x$(N2D+)/$x$(N2H+)=$1.03^{+0.07}_{-0.56}$. The observationally inferred profiles of $x$(ortho-H2D+) and $x$(N2D+)/$x$(N2H+) are reproduced by a deuteration-focused chemo-dynamical model; however, the central ortho-H2D+ depletion is only marginally matched within the $2\\sigma$ upper limit, likely suggesting additional deuteration in the depletion zone. From these models we infer a core age of ~0.42Ma, comparable to the free-fall time, suggesting that the substructures formed via rapid, turbulence-dominated fragmentation rather than slow, quasi-static contraction. Our observations also reveal that ortho-H2D+ velocity dispersions are largely subsonic in the core and nearly thermal between B1 and B2, consistent with turbulence dissipating within a few free-fall times. These results highlight the critical role of deuterated ions for both chemical evolution and dynamics in dense cores.",

Cuppen 15 pages, 9 figures, accepted to Astronomy and Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Astrochemical models are essential to bridge the gap between the timescales of reactions, experiments, and observations. Ice chemistry in these models experiences a large computational complexity as a result of the many parameters required for the modeling of chemistry occurring on these ices, such as binding energies and reaction energy barriers. Many of these parameters are poorly constrained, and accurately determining all would be too costly. We aim to find out which parameters describing ice chemistry have a large effect on the calculated abundances of ices for different prestellar objects. Using Monte Carlo sampled binding energies, diffusion barriers, desorption and diffusion prefactors, and reaction energy barriers, we determined the sensitivity of the abundances of the main ice species calculated with UCLCHEM, an astrochemical modeling code, on each of these parameters. We do this for a large grid of physical conditions across temperature, density, cosmic ray ionization rate and UV field strength. We find that, regardless of the physical conditions, the main sensitivities of abundances of the main ice species are the diffusion barriers of small and relatively mobile reactive species such as H, N, O, HCO, and CH$_3$. Thus, these parameters should be determined more accurately to increase the accuracy of models, paving the way to a better understanding of observations of ices. In many cases, accurate reaction energy barriers are not essential due to the treatment of competition between reactions and diffusion.",

Williams 18 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present the first localized detections of the cold neutral medium (CNM) in IC10, offering a rare view of dense atomic gas in a low-metallicity (0.27 solar metallicity) dwarf galaxy. As a low-metallicity starburst, IC10's interstellar medium conditions could reflect small-scale physical conditions that mirror those of early galaxies, providing a unique window into the heating and cooling processes that shaped the interstellar medium in early-Universe environments. Leveraging the high angular (<5'' ~ 15pc) and spectral (0.4 km/s) resolution of the Local Group L-band Survey, we searched for HI absorption against nine continuum radio sources and detected absorption along three sightlines corresponding to internal radio emission sources within IC10. Using Gaussian decomposition and radiative transfer, we characterize the CNM, deriving spin temperatures of ~30-55 K, column densities of (0.6-3.0)x 1$0^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, cold HI fractions of ~ 21-37%, and line widths of ~ 5.6-13.6 km/s. For each individual detection of HI absorption, we find corresponding molecular emission from 12CO (J=1-0), HCO+ (J=1-0), and HCN (J=1-0) at similar velocities and with comparable linewidths, indicating a well-mixed cold atomic and molecular medium. In IC10, the CNM shows a clear kinematic connection to the high-density ISM, implying a stronger dynamical coupling with molecular gas than in the Milky Way, in line with expectations for low-metallicity environments. At the ~ 15 pc scales probed by slightly extended HII regions in IC10, unresolved CNM clouds likely contribute to line blending, so the observed broad HI linewidths may partly reflect spatial and kinematic averaging.",

Bauer, Maria Isabel Carnerero, Claudia Maria Raiteri, Marta Fatovic Accepted for publication on Astronomy&Astrophysics on Nov. 17 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Variability is a striking features of quasars, observed at all timescales wavelengths. Studying its properties and the correlations with the physical parameters (e.g. black hole mass and accretion rate) provides significant insights into accretion physics. However, the detailed picture and the exact interplay between different emitting regions are not yet clear. We combine data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System 1 (Pan-STARRS1, PS1), the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), and the Gaia space telescope to constrain the power spectrum of quasars in the Stripe-82 region over a broad frequency range, 10^{-1} to 10^{-3} day^{-1}(rest frame). Light curves are matched and cross-calibrated to reach \\sim 20 years in the r-band for 4037 quasars. We split the sample into bins of the same black hole mass, accretion rate, and redshift, and measure the ensemble power spectral density (PSD) in each bin. The power spectra of SDSS, ZTF, and Gaia are measured independently. We do not measure it on PS1 data due to more erratic cadence, but we discuss the use of interpolation techniques, eventually allowing us to use the data together. We find significant evidence that the long-term UV/optical variability of quasars is stationary, as the ensemble PSD estimates from SDSS, Gaia and ZTF are consistent within the errors despite coming from different surveys and years. The PSD shape is consistent with a bending power law with spectral indices of -2.7 and -1 at high and low frequencies. A fit with the PSD associated with a damped random walk is significantly worse. The PSD amplitude below the break does not depend on black hole mass, but there is some evidence for anti-correlation with the accretion rate. The bending frequency, instead, scales with the black hole mass as $\\nu_b$ \\propto M_{\\mathrm{BH}}^{-0.6\\pm0.1} and does not depend on the accretion rate.",

In particular, the GC contains high-density gas and dust that is collectively referred to as the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). In this work, we study a subset of HNCO filaments identified in band 3 ALMA observations of the GC obtained by the ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey (ACES) that are comparable to high density filaments identified in the Galactic Disk. We compare the orientation of the magnetic field derived from 214 um SOFIA and 850 um JCMT observations with the filament orientation to determine which mechanisms dominate the formation of these filaments. We observe a large range of magnetic orientations in our observed filaments indicating the complex environments the filaments are located in. We also compare the observational results to synthetic data sets created using an MHD model of the GC. Our analysis reveals that the dominant mechanisms local to the HNCO filaments vary throughout the GC with some filaments being dominated by supersonic turbulence and others by subsonic turbulence. The comparison to synthetic observations indicates that the observed filaments are in magnetically dominated environments that could be supporting these filaments against collapse. Our results on the CMZ filaments are also compared to results obtained on similar filaments located in the Galactic Disk, and we find that the filaments studied here are possible CMZ analogs to the dense filamentary \"bones\" observed previously in the Galactic Disk.",

Assuming a constant stellar tidal dissipation factor, $Q^{'}_{*}$, of $10^6$, we predict ~ 5 - 10 detections. We additionally consider an empirical period-dependent parameterization of $Q^{'}_{*} \\propto P^{-3}$ and find a substantially suppressed yield.

Observatories like {\\it Chandra}, LIGO, and more recently, {\\it Gaia}, have provided valuable insights into the configurations of these elusive objects when residing in binary systems. Motivated by these advances, we study, for the first time, the enhanced accretion of metals from the interstellar medium (ISM) onto low-mass companions in binary systems with highly unequal mass ratios, utilizing a series of hydrodynamical simulations. Our study demonstrates that a stellar companion's metal accretion history from the ISM alone, from its formation to the present, can significantly influence its surface abundances, especially when enhanced by a massive black hole companion. However, this effect is likely only measurable in stars that are still in the main sequence. Once a stellar companion evolves off the main sequence, similar to what has been observed with the {\\it Gaia} BH3 companion, the initial dredge-up process are likely to erase any excess surface abundance resulting from the metals that were accreted. As we discover more unequal mass ratio binary systems, it is crucial to understand how the observed metallicity of sun-like companions may differ from their birth metallicity, especially if they are not yet evolved.",

The iSTARMOD code is accompanied here with a series of calibrations of $\\chi$-functions, to transform the excess emission equivalent widths measured through iSTARMOD into absolute surface fluxes. The method provided with this code and the corresponding flux calibrations allows for the automatic characterization of the chromospheric activity of a large number of spectra or a large number of stars and is also very useful for mitigating the effect of activity on radial velocities in the search for exoplanets.",

Reeves, Tatiana Niembro, Kristoff W. Paulson, Michael L. Stevens 18 pages, 14 figures, submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) Solar prominences are cool, dense stable structures routinely observed in the corona. Prominences are often ejected from the Sun via coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, they are rarely detected in a cool, low-ionized state within CMEs measured in situ, making their evolution hard to study. We examine the thermodynamic evolution of one of these rare cases where a quiescent prominence eruption clearly preserves its low-ionized charge state as evidenced by in situ detection. We use multi-viewpoint Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) observations to track and estimate the density, temperature and speed of the prominence as it erupts. We observe that part of the prominence remains in absorption well beyond initial liftoff, indicating the bulk of the prominence experiences minimal ionization and suggesting any strong heating is balanced by radiative losses, expansion, or conduction. From its subsequent in situ passage near 1au, charge states reveal that the prominence is composed of both cool, low-ionized ions as well as hotter plasma reflected by the presence of highly ionized iron, Fe$^{16+}$. Simulated non-equilibrium ionization and recombination results using observationally derived initial conditions match the in situ multi-thermal state for a prominence composed of 70% cool plasma with a 1.8MK peak temperature, and 30% hot plasma with a 4.3MK peak temperature. This suggests that the prominence may not be heated uniformly or that parts of it cools more rapidly. The complex, multi-thermal nature of this erupting prominence emphasizes the need for more comprehensive spectral observations of the global corona.",

For the first time, we propose a zero radial diffusion BC for BL dynamo models, enabling their surface field evolution to align consistently with surface flux transport simulations. We derive a zero radial diffusion BC from the Magnetohydrodynamic induction equation and evaluate its effects in comparison with two alternatives: (i) a radial outer BC, and (ii) a radial outer BC combined with strong near-surface radial pumping. The comparison is carried out both for the evolution of a single bipolar magnetic region and within a full BL dynamo model. The zero radial diffusion outer BC effectively suppresses radial diffusion across the surface, ensuring consistency between the evolution of the bipolar magnetic region in the BL dynamo and the surface flux transport model. With this outer BC, the full BL dynamo model successfully reproduces the fundamental properties of the solar cycle. In addition, the model naturally produces a surface magnetic field that is not purely radial, in closer agreement with solar observations. The physically motivated zero radial diffusion boundary condition paves the way for deeper insight into the solar and stellar cycles.",

Kovári Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Quantifying stellar parameters and magnetic activity for cool stars in double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2) is not straightforward, as both stars contribute to the observed composite spectra and are likely variable. Disentangled component spectra allow a detailed analysis of a component's magnetic activity. We aim at separating the spectra of the two stellar components of the HR\\,7275 SB2 system. Our further aim is a more accurate orbital solution by cleaning the observed radial velocities (RV) from activity perturbations of the spotted primary (\"RV jitter\") and obtain a surface image of this component. The Doppler image of the primary shows two large cool spots of size $\\approx$20\\% of the visible hemisphere plus three smaller spots, each still $\\approx$13\\% in size. In total, HR\\,7275a exhibited an impressive spottedness of $\\approx$40\\%\\ of its entire surface in May-June 2022. The RV is modulated by the rotation of the primary with maximum amplitudes of 320\\,\\ms\\ and 650\\,\\ms\\ for two different modulation behaviors during the 250\\,d of our observations. This jitter is primarily caused by the varying asymmetries of the apparent disk brightness due to the cool spots. Its removal resulted in roughly ten times higher precision of the orbital elements. Our snapshot magnetic-field measurements reveal phase-dependent (large-scale) surface fields between +0.6$\\pm$2.0\\,G at phase 0.1 and $-$15.2$\\pm$2.7\\,G at phase 0.6, indicating a complex magnetic morphology related to the location of the photospheric spots. We also obtain a logarithmic lithium abundance of 0.58$\\pm$0.1 for HR\\,7275a, indicating considerable mixing, and 0.16$^{+0.23}_{-0.63}$ for HR\\,7275b, which is an extremely low value. }",

Located only 36.4 pc distant, HD 61005 is young (approx. 100 Myr), x-ray bright (300 times Solar), observed with nearly edge-on geometry, and surrounded by Local Interstellar Medium (LISM) material denser than in the environ of the Sun. HD 61005 is known to harbor large amounts of circumstellar dust in a dense ecliptic plane full of mm-sized particles plus attached, extended wing like structures full of micron sized particles, which are evidence for a strong LISM-dust disk interaction. These properties aided our ability to resolve the 220 au wide astrosphere of HD61005, the first ever observed for a main sequence G-star. The observed x-ray emission morphology is roughly spherical, as expected for an astrospheric structure dominated by the host star. The Chandra spectrum of HD 61005 is a combination of a hard stellar coronal emission (T=8 MK) at Lx = 6 x10e29 erg per sec, plus an extended halo contribution at Lx = 1x10e29 erg per sec dominated by charge exchange (CXE) lines, such as those of OVIII and NeIX. The Chandra CXE x-ray morphology does not track the planar dust morphology but does extend out roughly to where the base of the dust wings begins. We present a toy model of x-ray emission produced by stellar wind (SW)-LISM CXE interactions, similar to the state of the young Sun when it was approximately 100 Myrs old (Guinan and Engle 2007), and transiting through an approximately 1000 times denser part of the interstellar medium (ISM) such as a Giant Molecular Cloud (Stern 2003, Opher and Loeb 2024).",

This study employs the ELEvoHI model to assess how incorporating STEREO/HI data from the Lagrange 5 (L5) perspective can enhance prediction accuracy for CME arrival times and speeds. Our investigation, preparing for the upcoming ESA Vigil mission, explores whether the progressive incorporation of HI data in real-time enhances forecasting accuracy. The role of human tracking variability is evaluated by comparing predictions based on observations by three different scientists, highlighting the influence of manual biases on forecasting outcomes. Furthermore, the study examines the efficacy of deriving CME propagation directions using HI-specific methods versus coronagraph-based techniques, emphasising the trade-offs in prediction accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of HI data to significantly improve operational space weather forecasting when integrated with other observational platforms, especially when HI data from beyond 35° elongation are used. These findings pave the way for optimising real-time prediction methodologies, providing valuable groundwork for the forthcoming Vigil mission and enhancing preparedness for CME-driven space weather events.",

Palumbo III 15 pages, 9 figures, 1 table; submitted to AAS journals Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The modeling of stellar spectra is pervasive in astronomy. Conventionally, the shapes of absorption lines are modeled by convolving thermal profiles (computed given some model stellar atmosphere and line list) with broadening kernels intended to account for the effects of rotation and other nonthermal sources of broadening (i.e., macroturbulence). Here, we show that the assumptions that permit this convolution can break down at high spectral resolution and produce appreciable errors in the modeled flux. We then consider the effects of rotation, microturbulence, and macroturbulence on the intensity and flux contribution functions, which astronomers use to map individual spectral segments to quasi-physical formation ``locations'' in the stellar atmosphere. We show that proper consideration of 1) the distinction between intensity and flux and 2) the inclusion of rotation and macroturbulence in the contribution function can dramatically change the modeled formation temperatures. To complement this analysis, we provide a package -- this http URL -- which quickly computes model line contribution functions and formation parameters given bulk stellar properties as input. In closing, we emphasize the assumptions inherent to this analysis, consider in which regimes the convolution expression for flux should be avoided, and caution how the concept of a singular ``formation temperature'' can oversimplify some realities of radiative transfer.",

Comments and suggestions are welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The study of star cluster evolution necessitates modeling how their density profiles develop from their natal gas distribution. Observational evidence indicates that many star clusters follow a Plummer-like density profile. However, most studies have focused on the phase after gas ejection, neglecting the influence of gas on early dynamical evolution. We investigate the development of star clusters forming within gas clouds, particularly those with a centrally concentrated gas profile. Simulations were conducted using the \\texttt{Torch} framework, integrating the \\texttt{FLASH} magnetohydrodynamics code into \\texttt{AMUSE}. This permits detailed modeling of star formation, stellar evolution, stellar dynamics, radiative transfer, and gas magnetohydrodynamics. We study the collapse of centrally concentrated, turbulent spheres with a total mass of $2.5\\times 10^3\\, M_\\odot$, investigating the effects of varying numerical resolution and star formation scenarios. The free-fall time is shorter at the center than at the edges of the cloud, with a minimum value of $0.55\\,\\mathrm{Myr}$. The key conclusions from this study are: (1) the final stellar density profile is more centrally concentrated than analytically predicted, reflecting the role of global gas collapse and feedback; (2) sub-clusters can initially form even in centrally concentrated gas clouds; (3) gas collapses globally toward the center on the central free-fall time scale, contradicting the assumption in analytical models of local fragmentation and star formation; and (4) the mass of the most massive star formed is directly correlated with the cluster effective radius and inversely correlated with the velocity dispersion, while the duration of star formation correlates with the star formation efficiency.",

Simon Daley-Yates, Ricarda Beckmann, Lewis McCallum, Moira Jardine, Andrew Cameron Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Observations of the planet-hosting star WASP-12 show a distinctive depression in the \\ion{Mg}{ii} and \\ion{Ca}{ii} resonance lines. This has been interpreted as a marker of atmospheric loss from the close-in hot Jupiter WASP-12b and the resulting formation of a gas torus around the star. In this paper we quantify the \\ion{Mg}{ii} absorption from this torus, compared to that provided by the stellar wind, the stellar astrosphere and the ISM. To do this we piece together the full density profile of \\ion{Mg}{ii} from WASP-12 to an observer on Earth using a combination of hydrodynamical simulations and observations. We find that the bulk of the gas along the line of sight is contained within a dense torus close to WASP-12. However, the temperatures in this torus are sufficient to promote Mg into a doubly (\\ion{Mg}{iii}) or higher ionized state. As a result, the singly ionized fraction (\\ion{Mg}{ii}) is low. We find that most of the \\ion{Mg}{ii} is not in the torus but in the ISM. Despite this, the total column density of \\ion{Mg}{ii} is two orders of magnitude lower than required to explain observations of the system. To resolve this discrepancy, we note that the torus gas is at a temperature where it will cool efficiently. We speculate that the onset of the cooling instability will cause the torus to fragment, forming cold clumps with a higher fraction of \\ion{Mg}{ii}, capable of explaining the observed absorption.",

From these data we infer effective $\\alpha$-viscosities, finding a remarkably broad range spanning over three orders of magnitude. This spread correlates with the stellar rotation period: systems with shorter periods exhibit significantly lower accretion rates, suggesting that they are undergoing at least temporary episodes of accretion bottleneck. We interpret this behaviour within the framework of magnetospheric accretion models, where the transition between steady accretion and the propeller regime is set by the relative locations of the co-rotation and magnetospheric radii. Our results indicate that stellar spin is a key parameter in regulating mass transfer from the disc to the star, and provide new evidence that the observed dispersion in $\\alpha$ reflects transitions between distinct accretion states rather than differences in global disc properties.",

While many studies on astrometric, spectroscopic, and photometric properties of BSSs in clusters have been conducted, there are few works in the literature regarding their pulsations and internal structure, which can indeed retain traces of their origin. In this work we computed and analysed a grid of collisional BSSs at low metallicity ($Z = 0.01\\; Z_\\odot$), finding that collision products present a peculiar chemical stratification that leads to periodicities in the period-spacing pattern of high-order gravity modes. These seismic fingerprints provide a unique opportunity to constrain the formation pathways of BSSs in globular clusters.",

Farr Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Starspots trace stellar magnetic activity and influence both stellar evolution and exoplanet characterization. While occultation-based spot analyses have been applied to individual systems, comparative studies remain limited. We apply the StarryStarryProcess Bayesian surface-mapping framework to archival Kepler light curves of two planet hosts, Kepler-63 and Kepler-17, extending the validation established on TOI-3884 (Paper I). Across both systems, we infer characteristic spot radii smaller than 10 degrees. The latitudinal spot distributions of these G dwarfs show active latitudes: Kepler-63 near 30 degrees and Kepler-17 near 15 degrees. Our analysis yields stellar obliquity measurements in excellent agreement with previous studies, validating our methodology and demonstrating that transit-based surface mapping can simultaneously recover planetary parameters, stellar orientations, and magnetic morphologies. Together, these results reveal a range of stellar geometries from nearly aligned (Kepler-17) to highly misaligned (Kepler-63).",

      "abstract": "Computing the Electronic Gain for Detectors Read Out Up-The-Ramp Timothy D. Brandt 13 pages, 6 figures. PASP in press Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The electronic gain -- the conversion between photoelectrons on a pixel and the digital number recorded to disk -- gives physical units to an astronomical image and sets the relation between pixel value and photon noise. This paper presents a new, likelihood-based approach to derive the gain from images taken up-the-ramp, where the detector is read out nondestructively many times before being reset. Our method makes full use of the individual reads assuming an ideal detector subject to photon noise and Gaussian read noise. We extend the method to account for slight nonlinearities in the relation between photoelectrons and measured counts. We demonstrate that our likelihood-based approach provides a consistent (i.e. asymptotically correct) and nearly unbiased estimator of the gain both with and without fitting for nonlinearity. Finally, we apply this approach to a single detector from the Wide-Field Instrument on the Roman Space Telescope, and show how pixel-to-pixel gain variations describe much of the variations in pixel response seen in flatfield images. Code to compute gain and regenerate figures in this paper is available at this https URL.",

      "abstract": "A Classic Nonlinearity Correction Algorithm for Detectors Read Out Up-The-Ramp Timothy D. Brandt 17 pages, 12 figures, PASP in press Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We derive an algorithm for computing a classic nonlinearity correction -- applicable to constant and uniform illumination -- in the presence of read noise and photon noise. The algorithm operates simultaneously on many nondestructive ramps at a range of count rates and directly computes the function transforming measured counts into linearized counts. We also compute chi squared for the corrected ramps, enabling the user to identify the polynomial degree beyond which chi squared ceases to improve significantly. The computational cost of our algorithm is linear in the number of reads and ramps, reaching ~100 hours to derive a correction for all 4096 x 4096 pixels of a Hawaii-4 RG detector from 186 illuminated 55-read ramps on a 2023 Macbook Pro laptop (~10,000 reads per pixel). We identify a potential source of bias in the nonlinearity correction when combining ramps of very different illuminations, together with effective mitigations. We apply our algorithm to a random set of pixels from the Roman Space Telescope's Wide Field Instrument. We find that a >=9th order nonlinearity correction is needed, at which point chi squared is close to its theoretically expected value and beyond which chi squared improves little with increasing polynomial order.

Huchmala, Malia Barker, Marvin Rothmeier, Jeffrey P. Morgenthaler, Amanda A. Sickafoose 25 pages, 10 figures, accepted to Astronomical Journal Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Short-period exoplanets may exhibit orbital precession driven by several different processes, including tidal interactions with their host stars and secular interactions with additional planets. This motion manifests as periodic shifts in the timing between transits which may be detectable via high-precision and long-baseline transit- and occultation-timing measurements. Detecting precession and attributing it to a particular process may constrain the tidal responses of planets and point to the presence of otherwise undetected perturbers. However, over relatively short timescales, orbital decay driven by the same tidal interactions can induce transit-timing signals similar to the precession signal, and distinguishing between the two processes requires robust assessment of the model statistics. In this context, occultation observations can help distinguish the two signals, but determining the precision and scheduling of observations sufficient to meaningfully contribute can be complicated. In this study, we expand on earlier work focused on searches for tidal decay to map out simple metrics that facilitate detection of precession and how to distinguish it from tidal decay. We discuss properties for a short-period exoplanet system that can maximize the likelihood for detecting such signals and prospects for contributions from citizen-science observations.",

The energy deposition spectrum of gamma rays scattering off target materials exhibits step-like features, known as Compton steps, near the binding energies of atomic electrons. We demonstrate a successful use of Compton steps for sub-keV calibration of cryogenic silicon calorimeters, utilizing four SuperCDMS High-Voltage eV-resolution (HVeV) detectors operated with 0 V bias across the crystal. This new calibration at 0 V is compared with the established high-voltage calibration using optical photons. The comparison indicates that the detector response at 0 V is about 30% weaker than expected, highlighting challenges in detector response modeling for low-mass dark matter searches.",

Final version published in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Few spectra of directly-imaged exoplanets have been obtained in the mid-infrared (> 3 $\\mu$m). This region is particularly rich in molecular spectral signatures, whose measurements can help recover atmospheric parameters and provide a better understanding of giant planet formation and atmospheric dynamics. In the past years, exoplanet interferometry with the VLTI/GRAVITY instrument has provided medium-resolution spectra of a dozen substellar companions in the near infrared. The 100-meter interferometric baselines allow for the stellar and planetary signals to be efficiently disentangled at close angular separations (< 0.3''). We aim to extend this technique to the mid-infrared using MATISSE, the VLTI's mid-infrared spectro-interferometer. We take advantage of the fringe tracking and off-axis pointing capabilities recently brought by the GRA4MAT upgrade. Using this new mode, we observed the giant planet $\\beta$ Pictoris b in L and M bands (2.75-5 $\\mu$m) at a spectral resolution of 500. We developed a method to correct chromatic dispersion and non-common paths effects in the fringe phase and modelled the planet astrometry and stellar contamination. We obtained a high-signal-to-noise spectrum of $\\beta$ Pictoris b, showing the planet continuum in L (for the first time) and M bands, which contains broad absorption features of H$_2$O and CO. In conjunction with a new GRAVITY spectrum, we modelled it with the ForMoSA nested sampling tool and the Exo-REM grid of atmospheric models, and found a solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio in the planet atmosphere. This study opens the way to the characterization of fainter and closer-in planets with MATISSE, which could complement the JWST at angular separations too close for it to obtain exoplanet spectra. Starting in 2025, the new adaptive optics system brought by the GRAVITY+ upgrade will further extend the detection limits of MATISSE.",

On the Earth, this escape is limited by transport though the tropospheric cold trap where water vapour condenses. However, on a tidally-locked exoplanet, the strong day-night temperature gradient drives a global-scale circulation. This circulation could rapidly transport water through the cold trap, potentially increasing hydrogen escape and impacting the composition of potentially habitable worlds. We couple cometary impact and planetary atmospheric models to simulate water-depositing impacts with both a tidally-locked and Earth-analogue atmosphere and quantify how atmospheric circulations transport water from the impact site to high altitudes where it can potentially drive escape. The global nature of the atmospheric circulations on a tidally-locked world enhances hydrogen escape, with both our unimpacted tidally-locked and Earth-analogue atmospheres exhibiting similar mass loss rates despite the tidally-locked atmosphere being bpth cooler and drier near the surface. When considering the effects of a cometary impact, we find an order of magnitude difference in peak escape rates between impacts on the day-side ($\\Phi_{\\mathrm{escape}}=1.33\\times10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,mth^{-1}}$) and night-side ($\\Phi_{\\mathrm{escape}}=1.51\\times10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,mth^{-1}}$) of a tidally-locked atmosphere, with the latter being of the same order of magnitude as the peak escape rate found for an impact with an Earth-analogue atmosphere ($\\Phi_{\\mathrm{escape}}=2.7\\times10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,mth^{-1}}$). Our results show the importance of understanding the underlying atmospheric circulations when investigating processes, such as hydrogen escape, which depend upon the vertical advective mixing and transport.",

Lawler Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The number of objects in orbit is rapidly increasing, primarily driven by the launch of megaconstellations, an approach to satellite constellation design that involves large numbers of satellites paired with their rapid launch and disposal. While satellites provide many benefits to society, their use comes with challenges, including the growth of space debris, collisions, ground casualty risks, optical and radio-spectrum pollution, and the alteration of Earth's upper atmosphere through rocket emissions and reentry ablation. There is substantial potential for current or planned actions in orbit to cause serious degradation of the orbital environment or lead to catastrophic outcomes, highlighting the urgent need to find better ways to quantify stress on the orbital environment. Here we propose a new metric, the CRASH Clock, that measures such stress in terms of the time it takes for a catastrophic collision to occur if there are no collision avoidance manoeuvres or there is a severe loss in situational awareness. Our calculations show the CRASH Clock is currently 2.8 days, which suggests there is now little time to recover from a wide-spread disruptive event, such as a solar storm. This is in stark contrast to the pre-megaconstellation era: in 2018, the CRASH Clock was 121 days.",

Cawood 71 pages, 7 figures, first revision submitted to Space Science Reviews, topical collection 'The Geoscience of Exoplanets: Going Beyond Habitability' Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Water and land surfaces on a planet interact with gases in the atmosphere and with radiation from the star. These interactions define the environments that prevail on the planet, some of which may be more amenable to prebiotic chemistry, some to the evolution of more complex life. This review article covers (i) the physical conditions that determine the ratio of land to sea on a rocky planet, (ii) how this ratio would affect climatic and biologic processes, and (iii) whether future astronomical observations might constrain this ratio on exoplanets. Water can be delivered in multiple ways to a growing rocky planet -- and although we may not agree on the contribution of different mechanism(s) to Earth's bulk water, hydrated building blocks and nebular ingassing could at least in principle supply several oceans' worth. The water that planets sequester over eons in their solid deep mantles is limited by the water concentration at water saturation of nominally anhydrous mantle minerals, likely less than 2000 ppm of the planet mass. Water is cycled between mantle and surface through outgassing and ingassing mechanisms that, while tightly linked to tectonics, do not necessarily require plate tectonics in every case. The actual water/land ratio at a given time emerges from the balance between the volume of surface water on the one hand, and on the other hand, the shape of the planet (its ocean basin volume) that is carved out by dynamic topography, the petrologic evolution of continents, impact cratering, and other surface-sculpting processes. By leveraging the contrast in reflectance properties of water and land surfaces, spatially resolved 2D maps of Earth-as-an-exoplanet have been retrieved from models using real Earth observations, demonstrating that water/land ratios of rocky exoplanets may be determined from data delivered by large-aperture, high-contrast imaging telescopes in the future.",

Marsh, Catherine Walsh, Felix Sainsbury-Martinez, Marrick Braam 32 pages, 7 figures, 1 table. Revised after first review in Climate of the Past this https URL Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph) The Great Oxidation Event (GOE) was a $200$ Myr transition circa 2.4 billion years ago that converted the Earth's anoxic atmosphere to one where molecular oxygen (O$_2$) was abundant (volume mixing ratio $>10^{-4}$). This significant rise in O$_2$ is thought to have substantially throttled hydrogen (H) escape and the associated water (H$_2$O) loss. Atmospheric estimations from the GOE onward place O$_2$ concentrations ranging between 0.1\\% to 150\\% PAL, where PAL is the present atmospheric level of 21% by volume. In this study we use WACCM6, a three-dimensional Earth System Model to simulate Earth's atmosphere and predict the diffusion-limited escape rate of hydrogen due to varying O$_2$ post-GOE. We find that O$_2$ indirectly acts as a control valve on the amount of hydrogen atoms reaching the homopause in the simulations: less O$_2$ leads to decreased O$_3$ densities, reducing local tropical tropopause temperatures by up to 18 K, which increases H$_2$O freeze-drying and thus reduces the primary source of hydrogen in the considered scenarios. The maximum differences between all simulations in the total H mixing ratio at the homopause and the associated diffusion-limited escape rates are a factor of 3.2 and 4.7, respectively. The prescribed CH$_4$ mixing ratio (0.8 ppmv) sets a minimum diffusion escape rate of $\\approx 2 \\times 10^{10}$ mol H yr$^{-1}$, effectively a negligible rate when compared to pre-GOE estimates ($\\sim 10^{12}-10^{13}$ mol H y$^{-1}$). Because the changes in our predicted escape rates are comparatively minor, our numerical predictions support geological evidence that the majority of Earth's hydrogen escape occurred prior to the GOE. Our work demonstrates that estimations of how the hydrogen escape rate evolved through Earth's history requires 3D chemistry-climate models which include a global treatment of water vapour microphysics.",

For more than 700 asteroids from two catalogues, the Johnston Archive [Johnston, 2024] and the Gaia DR3 VizieR list of binary candidates from Liberato et al. [2024], we applied a resonance identification algorithm, treating all planetary perturbations. Our results showed that the presence of binary asteroids in MMRs largely depends on their dynamical class. The highest percentage, more than 30%, is found in the Trans- Neptunian region, where most of these objects have exhibited resonant librations longer than 10 Myr. For the main-belt asteroid pairs, this percentage is about 10-12%. Contrary to expectations, the more unstable region populated with NEOs, showed a higher percentage of resonant pairs (above 17%), but with temporal resonant captures. These results could indicate that the mean motion resonances, particularly the stronger ones, could play a role in the evolution and formation of binary systems. Finally, we highlight that in the present paper, 82 resonant binary asteroids are newly identified.",

We refer to these events as Rogue Vertical Drafts (RVDs). They exceed five standard deviations of observed vertical velocities and appear as paired updraft-downdraft structures in varicose mode. Four-dimensional observations reveal that RVDs are intermittent, recurrent, and unpredictable. On average, they are expected to occur every sim 12 days during summer over Northern Norway, assuming a 1000 s interval. Different instruments may capture only portions of these events, for example, only upward or downward drafts when restricted to a single altitude range. Despite their rarity, their magnitudes and frequency suggest potential impacts on dust-sized matter escaping from planets, natural and anthropogenic space material, and MLT climate and processes. We propose that RVDs are a fundamental yet under-recognized feature of the MLT, underscoring the need for global observations to assess their prevalence and significance.",

These internal waves, generated by tidal flow over submarine topography, can propagate for thousands of kilometres across ocean basins, and become unstable through wave-mean flow or wave-wave interactions. Satellite observations of internal tides have shown that part of their lunar semidiurnal (M2) altimetry signal loses phase coherence in equatorial regions, thus affecting how we interpret their dynamics and energy distribution (Buijsman et al. 2017). We investigate the interaction of a baroclinic M2 internal tide wavepacket with an equatorial zonal jet, possibly of any horizontal or vertical structure. The dynamics of the low modes are explored as well as the potential excitation of higher vertical modes and how these interactions can generate incoherences in the baroclinic tide signal. We develop an idealized linear model using modal decomposition (Kelly et al. 2016), which is solved using Dedalus, to study the dynamics of a mode 1 M2 internal wavepacket on an equatorial beta plane. A zonal jet, with a uniform or a sheared vertical structure, is added at the equator to investigate potential wave-mean flow interaction. We find that a vertically uniform zonal jet affects the propagation of the mode 1 wavepacket. Depending on the strength of the jet, this can cause total reflection or strong distortion of the wavepacket. In contrast, a wavepacket entering a vertically sheared jet shows energy scattering into higher modes, which have lower phase and group speeds, shorter wavelengths, and are thus more susceptible to dissipation (and critical layers for non-uniform stratification). As the wavepacket exits the jet, reverse energy transfer occurs and the phase speed difference between the modes may explain part of the phase incoherence observed in altimetry data.",

We find that the eddies associated with wave activities can transport angular momentum upgradient to zonal flow, leading to acceleration of the equatorial superrotation. The dominant wave modes identified in this study are consistent with previous studies, with zonal wavenumber 1 being the major contributor to the prograde acceleration. Despite the same conclusion of maintenance of equatorial superrotation via wave-mean interactions, we find that the way waves interact with the zonal flow in TitanWRF is slightly different from some other studies. We confirm our previous findings that in TitanWRF this occurs primarily during a dozen or so annual, short-duration (a few Titan sols) angular momentum \"transfer events\", which have a repeatable seasonal pattern but differ slightly in timing and magnitude between years. This is not the case in the Titan Atmosphere Model (TAM), which found milder angular momentum transfers that produced the strongest acceleration of superrotation around solstice in the upper stratosphere and more continuous year-around acceleration in the lower stratosphere. Despite differences in angular momentum transfer across models, we further find that, similar to the TAM wave analysis results, eddies generated by Rossby-Kelvin instabilities may be the major source of prograde angular momentum for the equatorial superrotation, although TitanWRF may also include contributions from the absorption of vertically propagating equatorial Kelvin waves. This differs from our previous work, which suggested barotropic waves were responsible for TitanWRF's solsticial transfer event.",

Turner The Astronomical Journal 170 (2025) 323 Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Ultra-hot Jupiters exhibit day-to-night temperature contrasts upwards of 1000 K due to competing effects of strong winds, short radiative timescales, magnetic drag, and H2 dissociation/recombination. Spectroscopic phase curves provide critical insights into these processes by mapping temperature distributions and constraining the planet's energy budget across different pressure levels. Here, we present the first NIRISS/SOSS phase curve of an ultra-hot Jupiter, WASP-121 b. The instrument's bandpass [0.6 - 2.85 micron] captures an estimated 50-83% of the planet's bolometric flux, depending on orbital phase, allowing for unprecedented constraints on the planet's global energy budget; previous measurements with HST/WFC3 and JWST/NIRSpec/G395H captured roughly 20% of the planetary flux. Accounting for the unobserved regions of the spectrum, we estimate effective day and nightside temperatures of T_day = 2717 +/- 17 K and T_night = 1562 +/- 19 K corresponding to a Bond albedo of A_B = 0.277 +/- 0.016 and a heat recirculation efficiency of epsilon = 0.246 +/- 0.014. Matching the phase-dependent effective temperature with energy balance models yields a similar Bond albedo of 0.3 and a mixed layer pressure of 1 bar consistent with photospheric pressures, but unexpectedly slow winds of 0.2 km/s, indicative of inefficient heat redistribution. The shorter optical wavelengths of the NIRISS/SOSS Order 2 yield a geometric albedo of A_g = 0.093 +/- 0.029 (3 sigma upper limit of 0.175), reinforcing the unexplained trend of hot Jupiters exhibiting larger Bond albedos than geometric albedos. We also detect near-zero phase curve offsets for wavelengths above 1.5 micron, consistent with inefficient heat transport, while shorter wavelengths potentially sensitive to reflected light show eastward offsets.",
