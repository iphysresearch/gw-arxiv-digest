      "abstract": "Luminosity distance dispersion in Swiss-cheese cosmology as a function of the hole size distribution Thippayawis Cheunchitra, Andrew Melatos, Rachel Webster 18 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The luminosity distance-redshift ($D_{\\rm L}$--$z$) relation derived from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) yields evidence for a nonzero cosmological constant. SNe Ia analyses typically fit to the functional form $D_{\\rm L}(z)$ derived theoretically from the homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. Yet, the metric in the epoch relevant to SNe Ia measurements deviates slightly from FLRW due to gravitational clumping of mass into large-scale structures like filaments and voids, whose sizes span many orders of magnitude. The small deviation is modeled typically by scalar perturbations to the FLRW metric. Each line of sight to a SNe Ia passes through a random sequence of structures, so $D_{\\rm L}$ differs stochastically from one line of sight to the next. Here, we calculate the $D_{\\rm L}$ dispersion in an exact Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi Swiss-cheese universe with a power-law hole size distribution, as a function of the lower cut-off $R_{\\rm min}$ and logarithmic slope $\\gamma$. We find that the standard deviation of $D_{\\rm L}$ scales as $\\sigma_{D_{\\rm L}} \\propto z^{2.25\\pm0.01} (R_{\\rm min}/24\\pm1\\,{\\rm Mpc})^{(0.157\\pm0.003)\\left[\\gamma - (1.16\\pm0.02)\\right]}$ for redshifts in the range $0.5 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 2.1$. The scaling shows that the $D_{\\rm L}$ dispersion is dominated by a few large voids rather than the many small voids.",

In this work, we revisit the quantum-corrected Higgs inflation scenario within the framework of a non-minimally coupled scalar field theory. Starting from the one-loop effective action, we incorporate radiative corrections through the anomalous scaling parameter ${\\bf A_I}$ and derive analytic expressions for the inflationary observables $n_s$ and $r$ in the Einstein frame. Our analysis demonstrates that quantum corrections naturally shift $n_s$ toward higher values while keeping the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ suppressed. For ${\\cal N} = 60$, the model predicts $n_s \\simeq 0.9743$ and $r \\simeq 5.4\\times10^{-3}$, in excellent agreement with the latest ACT+DESI (P-ACT-LB) data and fully consistent with the \\textit{Planck}~2018 limit $r < 0.036$. The derived constraint $4.36\\times10^{-10} < \\lambda/\\xi^{2} < 10.77\\times10^{-10}$ confirms the robustness of the quantum-corrected Higgs framework and indicates that near-future CMB polarization experiments such as CORE, AliCPT, LiteBIRD, and CMB-S4 will be able to probe the predicted parameter space with high precision.",

Lousto, Yosef Zlochower (RIT) Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We report the first 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation that captures the full, self-consistent evolution from the late inspiral through merger and subsequent recoil of a supermassive binary black hole (SMBBH) with misaligned spins embedded in an equilibrated circumbinary disk (CBD). Our full numerical simulation follows the final 40 orbits of the inspiral and merger of the binary, following an initial phase of 165 orbits of CBD evolution toward equilibrium. We find that the jets, launched from the minidisks surrounding each black hole, are tilted toward the black hole spin direction close to the individual black holes, but align with the binary's total angular momentum at larger distances. Following the merger, the remnant black hole receives a recoil kick exceeding 1000 km/s. Remarkably, it retains its gravitationally bound CBD as if it were ejected from a galactic nucleus. Furthermore, the jet launched by the recoiling remnant black hole preserves the large-scale orientation established during the late inspiral. We demonstrate that the majority of the luminosity emerges from a region in close proximity to the black hole, suggesting that the accretion disk surrounding the recoiling remnant would remain the most luminous feature postmerger, persisting for long enough to be observable by modern telescopes (hours in the case of LISA sources). These findings introduce a direct, first-principles model for the recoil of supermassive black holes (SMBH) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), offering a comprehensive theoretical basis to support and elucidate both ongoing and future observational efforts.",

We consider a spectator scalar with Higgs-like couplings and inflaton decay via shift symmetric dimension-five operators. The spectator is assumed to be in the Sitter vacuum and it sources blue-tilted, strongly non-Gaussian curvature perturbations which can dominate the spectrum on small scales $k \\gg \\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$.

Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We perform a multiprobe analysis combining cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), ACT CMB lensing, and large-scale structure (LSS) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), including DESI Legacy Imaging Survey (LS) galaxies and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs). We present the first $5\\times2$pt analysis of ACT DR6 lensing, DESI LS, and Planck ISW. Within $\\Lambda$CDM, this yields $S_8 = \\sigma_8(\\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.819 \\pm 0.016$, in good agreement with primary CMB inferences and provides a sound-horizon-free Hubble constant constraint of $H_0 = 70.0 \\pm 4.4$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Then, combining with CMB primary and BAO, we reconfirm a CMB-BAO discrepancy in the $\\Omega_m$-$\\frac{D_v}{r_d}$ plane, which is heightened when combining BAO with the $5\\times2$pt data vector. We explore two dark-energy extensions that may reconcile this: an early-time modification, early dark energy (EDE), and late-time dynamical dark energy (DDE) parameterized by $w_0w_a$. For CMB primary+BAO+$5\\times2$pt, we find a $3.3\\sigma$ preference for DDE over $\\Lambda$CDM, while EDE is modestly favoured at $2.3\\sigma$. The models address different shortcomings of $\\Lambda$CDM: DDE relaxes the neutrino mass bound ($M_\\nu<0.17$eV vs. $<0.050$eV under $\\Lambda$CDM), making it compatible with neutrino oscillation measurements, while EDE raises the Hubble constant to $H_0=70.5\\pm1.2\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$, easing the discrepancy with SH0ES. However, neither model resolves both issues simultaneously. Our analysis indicates that both DDE and EDE remain viable extensions of $\\Lambda$CDM within current uncertainties and demonstrates the capacity of combined probes to place increasingly stringent constraints on cosmological parameters.",

Using a nonperturbative $\\delta N$ approach applied to the lattice output, we generate fully nonlinear three-dimensional maps of $\\zeta$. This calculation captures both the non-Gaussianity arising from the nonlinear mapping between $\\phi$ and $\\zeta$, and the intrinsic non-Gaussianity generated around Hubble crossing by the nonlinear field dynamics, which is neglected in stochastic approaches. We find that the nonlinear mapping has a profound impact on the statistics, significantly enhancing the positive tail of the $\\zeta$ probability distribution, with important implications for observable quantities. A central part of this work is the comparison with the standard perturbative treatment based on a gauge transformation, which allows us to quantify when and how the perturbative picture breaks down as fluctuations grow large. Together with arXiv:2410.23942, this work sets the basis for robust, nonperturbative predictions of primordial black hole production and scalar-induced gravitational wave emission from inflation using lattice simulations.",

Barish As part of the Astrophysical Journal Letters Focus Issue on the Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We analyze data from 142 of the 218 gravitational-wave (GW) sources in the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration (LVK) Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4.0) to estimate the Hubble constant $H_0$ jointly with the population properties of merging compact binaries. We measure the luminosity distance and redshifted masses of GW sources directly; in contrast, we infer GW source redshifts statistically through i) location of features in the compact object mass spectrum and merger rate evolution, and ii) identifying potential host galaxies in the GW localization volume. Probing the relationship between source luminosity distances and redshifts obtained in this way yields constraints on cosmological parameters. We also constrain parameterized deviations from general relativity which affect GW propagation, specifically those modifying the dependence of a GW signal on the source luminosity distance. Assuming our fiducial model for the source-frame mass distribution and using GW candidates detected up to the end of the fourth observing run (O4a), together with the GLADE+ all-sky galaxy catalog, we estimate $H_0 = 76.6^{+13.0}_{-9.5} (76.6^{+25.2}_{-14.0})$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. This value is reported as a median with 68.3% (90%) symmetric credible interval, and includes combination with the $H_0$ measurement from GW170817 and its electromagnetic counterpart. Using a parametrization of modified GW propagation in terms of the magnitude parameter $\\Xi_0$, we estimate $\\Xi_0 = 1.2^{+0.8}_{-0.4} (1.2^{+2.4}_{-0.5})$, where $\\Xi_0 = 1$ recovers the behavior of general relativity.",

Using a custom-built semi-analytical model developed specifically for this study, we implement a simple dust shielding prescription that accounts for the absorption of LW photons by dust grains. We find that even modest dust enrichment can significantly reduce the effective LW radiation field, allowing H$_2$ cooling to persist in regions previously thought to be affected by LW feedback. This changes the conditions for seed formation, particularly for heavy seeds which require suppression of H$_2$ cooling. Our results suggest that dust shielding extends the redshift range and volume where heavy seeds can form, and significantly alters the relative importance of different seed populations. We discuss the implications for the formation of high-redshift SMBHs and future observations.",

However, this view is being completely altered by the early dark energy (EDE) resolutions of the Hubble tension, known as the most prominent tension the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model is suffering from. In corresponding models with pre-recombination EDE, resolving the Hubble tension (i.e., achieving $H_0\\sim 73$km/s/Mpc) must be accompanied by a shift of $n_s$ towards unity to maintain consistency with the cosmological data, which thus implies a scale invariant Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum with $n_s=1$ $(|n_s-1|\\simeq {\\cal O}(0.001))$. In this work, we strengthen and reconfirm this result with the latest ground-based CMB data from ACT DR6 and SPT-3G D1, the precise measurements at high multipoles beyond the Planck angular resolution and sensitivity. Our work again highlights the importance of re-examining our understanding on the very early Universe within the broader context of cosmological tensions.",

Comments welcome Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The mildly non-linear regime of cosmic structure formation holds much of the information that upcoming large-scale structure surveys aim to exploit, making fast and accurate predictions on these scales essential. We present the $N$-body module of DISCO-DJ (DIfferentiable Simulations for COsmology - Done with Jax), designed to deliver high-fidelity, GPU-accelerated, and differentiable particle-mesh simulations tailored for cosmological inference. Theory-informed time integrators such as the recently introduced BullFrog method allow for accurate predictions already with few time steps (e.g. $6$ steps for per-cent-level accuracy in terms of the present-day power spectrum at $k \\approx 0.2 \\, h / \\mathrm{Mpc}$ using $N = 512^3$ particles, which takes just a few seconds). To control discreteness effects and achieve high accuracy, the code incorporates a suite of advanced techniques, for example a custom non-uniform FFT implementation for force evaluation. Both forward- and reverse-mode differentiation are supported, with memory requirements independent of the number of time steps; in the reverse case, this is achieved through an adjoint formulation. We extensively study the effect of various numerical parameters on the accuracy. As an application of DISCO-DJ, we perform field-level inference by recovering $\\sigma_8$ and the initial conditions from a noisy Gadget matter density field. Coupled with our recently introduced Einstein--Boltzmann solver, the DISCO-DJ ecosystem provides a self-consistent, fully differentiable pipeline for modelling the large-scale structure of the universe.

It implements a fully optimal analysis with a pixel-wise covariance model.

      "abstract": "Large-scale peculiar velocities in the universe Christos G. Tsagas, Leandros Perivolaropoulos, Kerkyra Asvesta Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Observations have repeatedly confirmed the presence of large-scale peculiar motions in the universe, commonly referred to as ``bulk flows''. These are vast regions of the observable universe, typically spanning scales of several hundred Mpc, that move coherently with speeds of the order of several hundred km/sec. While there is a general consensus on the direction of these motions, discrepancies persist in their reported sizes and velocities, with some of them exceeding the predictions of the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model. The observed large-scale peculiar-velocity fields are believed to have originated as weak peculiar-velocity perturbations soon after equipartition, which have subsequently grown by structure formation and by the increasing inhomogeneity of the post-recombination universe. However, the evolution and the implications of these bulk velocity fields remain poorly understood and they are still a matter of debate. For instance, it remains a challenge for the theoreticians to explain the high velocities measured by several bulk-flow surveys, like those recently reported using the CosmicFlows-4 data. Such extensive and fast velocity fields could have played a non-negligible role during structure formation and they might have also ``contaminated'' our observations. After all, in the history of astronomy, there are examples where relative-motion effects have led us to a serious misinterpretation of reality (shortened abstract due to length limits).",

Weaver, R. H. Wechsler, R. Zhou 20 pages, 11 figures, submitted to The Open Journal of Astrophysics Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Combined survey analyses of galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing (3x2-pt studies) will allow new and accurate tests of the standard cosmological model. However, careful validation is necessary to ensure that these cosmological constraints are not biased by uncertainties associated with the modelling of astrophysical or systematic effects. In this study we validate the combined 3x2-pt analysis of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI-DR1) spectroscopic galaxy clustering and overlapping weak lensing datasets from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), the Dark Energy Survey (DES), and the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Survey (HSC). By propagating the modelling uncertainties associated with the non-linear matter power spectrum, non-linear galaxy bias and baryon feedback, we design scale cuts to ensure that measurements of the matter density and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum are biased by less than 30% of the statistical error. We also test the internal consistency of the data and weak lensing systematics by performing new measurements of the lensing shear ratio. We demonstrate that the DESI-DR1 shear ratios can be successfully fit by the same model used to describe cosmic shear correlations, and analyse the additional information that can be extracted about the source redshift distributions and intrinsic alignment parameters. This study serves as crucial preparation for the upcoming cosmological parameter analysis of these datasets.",

Accepted for publication in A&A Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Complex energy transfer processes in the intracluster medium (ICM) can revive fossil (with spectral ages $\\gg100$ Myr) plasma initially generated by radio galaxies. This leads to the re-ignition of faint radio sources with irregular and filamentary morphologies, and ultra-steep ($\\alpha \\gtrsim 1.5$) synchrotron spectra, which can be more easily detected at low frequencies ($\\sim 100$ MHz). These sources offer the opportunity to investigate the microphysics of the ICM and its interplay with radio galaxies, the origin of seed relativistic electrons, the merging history of the host cluster, and the phenomenology of radio filaments. The study of revived sources has so far been hampered by the requirement of sensitive and high-resolution multi-frequency radio data at low frequencies to characterise their spatial properties and provide a proper classification. We aim to perform the analysis of a sample of candidate revived sources identified among nearby ($z\\leq0.35$) and low-mass ($M_{500}\\leq5\\times 10^{14} M_\\odot$) \\textit{Planck} clusters in the footprint of LoTSS-DR2. By inspecting LoTSS-DR2 images at 144 MHz, we identified 7 targets with patchy and filamentary morphologies, which have been followed-up with the uGMRT at 400 MHz. By combining LOFAR and uGMRT data, we obtained high-resolution images and spectral index maps, which we used to interpret the nature of the sources. All targets show regions with very steep spectra, confirming the effectiveness of our morphology-based selection in identifying fossil plasma. Based on their morphology, spectral properties, and optical associations, we investigated the origin of the targets. We found a variety of promising revived fossil sources, while also showing that apparently intricate structures can be easily misclassified in the absence of high-resolution and multi-band data.",

It is now possible to directly measure the apparent drift of high-redshift astronomical sources across the sky $\\textit{in real time}$. This so-called $\\textit{position drift}$ provides a valuable probe of the peculiar velocity field and cosmic structure formation by giving direct access to the transverse velocity that is otherwise currently not measurable and must be statistically reconstructed from the density field in a model-dependent way. To fully exploit this new window into the Universe, it is essential to understand how cosmological structures affect position drift measurements. Here we present the first position drift study based on the general relativistic N-body simulation code $\\texttt{gevolution}$. We calculate the position drift directly from the past light cone for ten different observers and compare the results to predictions from linear perturbation theory. At linear order, the position drift is directly proportional to the transverse velocity on the sky. This linear approximation reproduces our non-linear simulation results to within about 5%. We calculate power spectra for the position drift, splitting the signal into an E- and B-mode and compare the former to linear expectations, finding good agreement. The B-mode is suppressed on linear scales, but has similar amplitude as the E-mode on non-linear scales. We further demonstrate that light-cone inhomogeneities induce biases in the dipole of the drift, introducing redshift dependence of both the amplitude and direction. Although our analysis is not yet sufficient for a firm conclusion, our results suggest that these effects alone cannot explain the possible redshift-dependent dipole in Gaia DR3 data reported in the literature.",

Trispectra of primordial matter density fluctuations produced in the early universe are modified by the subsequent nonlinear structure formation. In this paper, we compute the nonlinear evolution of the parity-odd matter trispectrum to one-loop order, i.e., to third order in density fluctuations, within the framework of effective field theory of the large-scale structure of the universe. By analyzing the different terms in the perturbation series, we demonstrate the structure of infrared divergence cancellations, as required by the equivalence principle. We also derive the forms of the counterterms required to renormalize the ultraviolet divergences. Adopting a specific model for a primordial parity-odd trispectrum, we numerically compute the leading-order effects of nonlinear gravitational evolution and study its impact on baryonic acoustic oscillations within the signal. These calculations are essential for comparing the observed trispectra of nonlinear cosmic density fields with theoretical expectations.",

The suite represents the first set of cosmological simulations that couples a vast non-equilibrium thermochemistry network of primordial species, metals, and molecules to multifrequency, on-the-fly radiation transport, allowing us to directly predict the spectral properties of early galaxies. By initializing the simulations at zero metallicity, resolving haloes well below the atomic cooling threshold, reaching parsec-scale resolution, and modeling a Milky Way-mass environment, we aim to address four key science themes: 1) Star formation at cosmic dawn, 2) Galaxy formation and the interstellar medium in the epoch of reionization, 3) The circumgalactic medium towards cosmic noon, and 4) Reionization in a local volume environment and near-field cosmology. In this introductory work, we present an overview of the physical characteristics of high-redshift MEGATRON galaxies and their environment at $z>8$. We present a library of $>175,000$ simulated galaxy spectra and demonstrate how the diversity of galaxy spectra seen by JWST is naturally reproduced in the context of a $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This project represents a step towards making more direct comparisons between simulations and observations and will enable future work to both optimize methods for inferring galaxy properties from observations and to elucidate the physics that governs galaxy formation in the early Universe.",

At near-infrared wavelengths, this extragalactic background light (EBL) is comprised of emission from galaxies stretching all the way back to the first-light objects present during the Epoch of Reionization. The Cosmic Infrared Background Experiment 2 (CIBER-2) is a sounding-rocket experiment designed to measure both the absolute photometric brightness of the EBL over 0.5 - 2.0 microns and perform an intensity mapping measurement of EBL spatial fluctuations in six broad bands over the same wavelength range. CIBER-2 comprises a 28.5 cm, 80K telescope that images several square degrees to three separate cameras. Each camera is equipped with an HAWAII-2RG detector covered by an assembly that combines two broadband filters and a linear-variable filter, which perform the intensity mapping and absolute photometric measurements, respectively. CIBER-2 has flown three times: an engineering flight in 2021; a terminated launch in 2023; and a successful science flight in 2024. In this paper, we review the science case for the experiment; describe the factors motivating the instrument design; review the optical, mechanical, and electronic implementation of the instrument; present preflight laboratory characterization measurements; and finally assess the instrument's performance in flight.",

Submitted to the Open Journal of Astrophysics, comments welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We study the stellar mass-iron metallicity relation of dwarf galaxies in the new high-resolution MEGATRON cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. These simulations model galaxy formation up to $z\\approx8$ in a region that will collapse into a Milky-Way-like galaxy at $z=0$, while self-consistently tracking Population III and II (Pop.~III, Pop.~II) star formation, feedback and chemical enrichment. MEGATRON dwarf galaxies are in excellent agreement with the observed stellar mass-metallicity relation at $z=0$, including an over-abundance of dwarfs along a flat plateau in metallicity ($\\langle [\\rm{Fe}/\\rm{H}] \\rangle \\approx -2.5$) at low stellar masses ($M_{\\star} \\leq 10^5 \\, \\rm{M}_{\\odot}$). We tie this feature to the chemical enrichment of dwarf galaxies by Pop.~III pair-instability supernova (PISN) explosions. The strong Lyman-Werner background (LW) from the protogalaxy ensures that PISNe occur in haloes massive enough ($\\approx 10^7\\, \\rm{M}_{\\odot}$) to retain their ejecta. We also predict a tail of $\\approx 20\\%$ of iron-deficient ($\\langle [\\rm{Fe}/\\rm{H}] \\rangle \\leq - 3$) dwarf galaxies. We show that both plateau and tail (i) are robust to large variations in Pop.~II feedback assumptions, and (ii) survive in bound satellites surrounding the central galaxy at $z=0$.",

The simulations combine on-the-fly radiative transfer with a detailed non-equilibrium thermochemical network (81 ions and molecules), resolving the cold and warm gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) on spatial scales down to 20 pc and on average 200 pc at cosmic noon. Comparing our full non-equilibrium calculation with local radiation to traditional post-processed photoionization equilibrium (PIE) models assuming a uniform UV background (UVB), we find that non-equilibrium physics and local radiation fields fundamentally impact the thermochemistry of the CGM. Recombination lags and local radiation anisotropy shift ions away from their PIE+UVB values and modify covering fractions (for example, HI damped Ly$\\alpha$ absorbers differ by up to 40%). In addition, a resolution study with cooling-length refinement allows us to double the resolution in the cold and warm CGM gas, reaching 120 pc on average. When refining on cooling length, the mass of the lightest cold clumps decreases tenfold to $\\approx 10^4\\,M_\\odot$, their boundary layers develop sharper ion stratification, and the warm gas is better resolved, boosting the abundance of warm gas tracers such as CIV and OIII. Together, these results demonstrate that non-equilibrium thermochemistry coupled to radiative transfer, combined with physically motivated resolution criteria, is essential to predict circumgalactic absorption and emission signatures and to guide the design of targeted observations with existing and upcoming facilities.",

      "abstract": "Constraints on dark matter models from the stellar cores observed in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies: Self-interacting dark matter Jorge Sanchez Almeida (1,2) ((1) Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias, La Laguna, Tenerife, E-38200, Spain, (2) Departamento de Astrofisica, Universidad de La Laguna, Spain) Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) It has been proposed that the stellar cores observed in ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies reflect underlying dark matter (DM) cores that cannot be formed by stellar feedback acting on collisionless cold dark matter (CDM) halos. Assuming this claim is correct, we investigate the constraints that arise if such cores are produced by self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We derive the range of SIDM cross-sections (sigma/m) required to reproduce the observed core sizes. These can result from halos in either the core-formation phase (low sigma/m) or the core-collapse phase (high sigma/m), yielding a wide allowed range (sim 0.3 -- 200 cm2/g) consistent with values reported in the literature for more massive galaxies. We also construct a simple model relating stellar mass to core radius - two observables likely connected in SIDM. This model reproduces the stellar core sizes and masses in UFDs with sigma/m consistent with those derived above. It also predicts a trend of increasing core radius with stellar mass, in agreement with observations of more massive dwarf galaxies. The model central DM densities match observations when assuming the SIDM profile to originate from an initial CDM halo that follows the mass-concentration relation. Since stellar feedback is insufficient to form cores in these galaxies, UFDs unbiasedly anchor sigma/m at low velocities. If the core-collapse scenario holds (i.e., high sigma/m), UFD halos are thermalized on kpc scales, approximately two orders of magnitude larger than the stellar cores. These large thermalization scales could potentially influence substructure formation in more massive systems.",

References updated; matches version published in JCAP, 30 January 2025 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) In the era of precision cosmology, ensuring the integrity of data analysis through blinding techniques is paramount -- a challenge particularly relevant for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). DESI represents a monumental effort to map the cosmic web, with the goal to measure the redshifts of tens of millions of galaxies and quasars. Given the data volume and the impact of the findings, the potential for confirmation bias poses a significant challenge. To address this, we implement and validate a comprehensive blind analysis strategy for DESI Data Release 1 (DR1), tailored to the specific observables DESI is most sensitive to: Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Redshift-Space Distortion (RSD) and primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG). We carry out the blinding at the catalog level, implementing shifts in the redshifts of the observed galaxies to blind for BAO and RSD signals and weights to blind for PNG through a scale-dependent bias. We validate the blinding technique on mocks, as well as on data by applying a second blinding layer to perform a battery of sanity checks. We find that the blinding strategy alters the data vector in a controlled way such that the BAO and RSD analysis choices do not need any modification before and after unblinding. The successful validation of the blinding strategy paves the way for the unblinded DESI DR1 analysis, alongside future blind analyses with DESI and other surveys.",

At the same time, they can maximize the constraining power from galaxy clustering on the scales amenable to perturbation theory. In order to apply the method to galaxy surveys, the forward model must account for the full observational complexity of the data. In this context, a major challenge is the inclusion of redshift space distortions (RSDs) from the peculiar motion of galaxies. Here, we present improvements in the efficiency and accuracy of the RSD modeling in the perturbative LEFTfield forward model. We perform a detailed quantification of the perturbative and numerical error for the prediction of momentum, velocity and the redshift-space matter density. Further, we test the recovery of cosmological parameters at the field level, namely the growth rate $f$, from simulated halos in redshift space. For a rigorous test and to scan through a wide range of analysis choices, we fix the linear (initial) density field to the known ground truth but marginalize over all unknown bias coefficients and noise amplitudes. With a third-order model for gravity and bias, our results yield $<1\\,\\%$ statistical and $<1.5\\,\\%$ systematic error. The computational cost of the redshift-space forward model is only $\\sim 1.5$ times of the rest frame equivalent, enabling future field-level inference that simultaneously targets cosmological parameters and the initial matter distribution.",

In order to leverage the rich data in these new maps to gain a better understanding of the physics that shapes the large-scale structure of the cosmos, observed matter distributions must be compared to simulated mock skies. Small mock skies can be produced using precise, physics-driven hydrodynamical simulations. However, the need to capture small, kpc-scale density fluctuations in the intergalactic medium (IGM) places tight restrictions on the necessary minimum resolution of these simulations. Even on the most powerful supercomputers, it is impossible to run simulations of such high resolution in volumes comparable to what will be probed by future surveys, due to the vast quantity of data needed to store such a simulation in computer memory. However, it is possible to represent the essential features of these high-resolution simulations using orders of magnitude less memory. We present a hybrid approach that employs a physics-driven hydrodynamical simulation at a much lower-than-necessary resolution, followed by a data-driven, deep-learning Enhancement. This hybrid approach allows us to produce hydrodynamic mock skies that accurately capture small, kpc-scale features in the IGM but which span hundreds of Megaparsecs. We have produced such a volume which is roughly one Gigaparsec in diameter and examine its relevant large-scale statistical features, emphasizing certain properties that could not be captured by previous smaller simulations. We present this hydrodynamic volume as well as a companion n-body dark matter simulation and halo catalog which we are making publically available to the community for use in calibrating data pipelines for upcoming survey analyses.",

This DESI Collaboration Publication is part of the Data Release 2 publication series (see this https URL) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Collaboration has obtained robust measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the redshift range, $0.1 < z < 4.2$, based on the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest and galaxies from Data Release 2 (DR2). We combine these measurements with external cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and ACT to place our tightest constraints yet on the sum of neutrino masses. Assuming the cosmological $\\Lambda$CDM model and three degenerate neutrino states, we find $\\sum m_\\nu<0.0642$ eV (95%) with a marginalized error of $\\sigma(\\sum m_\\nu)=0.020$ eV. We also constrain the effective number of neutrino species, finding $N_\\rm{eff} = 3.23^{+0.35}_{-0.34}$ (95%), in line with the Standard Model prediction. When accounting for neutrino oscillation constraints, we find a preference for the normal mass ordering and an upper limit on the lightest neutrino mass of $m_l < 0.023$ eV (95%). However, we determine using frequentist and Bayesian methods that our constraints are in tension with the lower limits derived from neutrino oscillations. Correcting for the physical boundary at zero mass, we report a 95% Feldman-Cousins upper limit of $\\sum m_\\nu<0.053$ eV, breaching the lower limit from neutrino oscillations. Considering a more general Bayesian analysis with an effective cosmological neutrino mass parameter, $\\sum m_{\\nu,\\rm{eff}}$, that allows for negative energy densities and removes unsatisfactory prior weight effects, we derive constraints that are in $3\\sigma$ tension with the same oscillation limit. In the absence of unknown systematics, this finding could be interpreted as a hint of new physics not necessarily related to neutrinos. The preference of DESI and CMB data for an evolving dark energy model offers one possible solution. In the $w_0w_a$CDM model, we find $\\sum m_\\nu<0.163$ eV (95%), relaxing the neutrino tension.

No, I do not consent with the use of this article for the training of AI models, as in this https URL Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Bayesian field-level inference of galaxy clustering guarantees optimal extraction of all cosmological information, provided that the data are correctly described by the forward model employed. The latter is unfortunately never strictly the case. A key question for field-level inference approaches then is where the cosmological information is coming from, and how to ensure that it is robust. In the context of perturbative approaches such as effective field theory, some progress on this question can be made analytically. We derive the parameter posterior given the data for the field-level likelihood given in the effective field theory, marginalized over initial conditions in the zero-noise limit. Particular attention is paid to cutoffs in the theory, the generalization to higher orders, and the error made by an incomplete forward model at a given order. The main finding is that, broadly speaking, an $m$-th order forward model captures the information in $n$-point correlation functions with $n \\leqslant m+1$. Thus, by adding more terms to the forward model, field-level inference is made to automatically incorporate higher-order $n$-point functions. Also shown is how the effect of an incomplete forward model (at a given order) on the parameter inference can be estimated.",

By carefully treating the initial conditions and parameter sampling, we identify a preferred parameter space featuring a sub-Planckian axion decay constant and a relatively large axion mass, which naturally avoids the quality problem and remains consistent with the perturbative string conjecture. Our parameter scan also uncovers a trans-Planckian regime of theoretical interest, which is only mildly disfavored even by the strongest constraint. Finally, we discuss the possible connection between this model and the recently reported non-zero rotation of the CMB linear polarization angle, emphasizing the broader cosmological implications and the promising prospects for testing this scenario.

In this note, we update our analysis using the Dark Energy Survey 5 year supernova data set (DES-SN5YR) and the baryon acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2). Approximating the scalar potential via a first order Taylor series $V \\approx V_0 + V_1 \\phi$ about the present value, and making use of only recent-time data from DES-SN5YR and DESI DR2, we find that the slope parameter is constrained as $V_1 = 1.49 \\pm 0.25$ in a standard likelihood analysis. This is naively a $>5 \\sigma$ discrepancy with $\\Lambda$CDM (which has $V_1 =0$), though a more detailed analysis not assuming a Gaussian likelihood distribution suggests $4 \\sigma$ significance. Based only on the $\\Delta \\chi^2 = -13.7$ improvement of fit while ignoring parameter space volumes disfavours $\\Lambda$CDM at a $3 \\sigma$ significance level. These significance measures are substantially improved from our previous analysis using older data sets. We also reproduce the DESI DR2 parameter constraints based on the same combination of data and find that the $\\Lambda$CDM is more strongly disfavoured in the context of the linear potential extension (dubbed $V_0V_1$) as compared with the $w_0 w_a$ extension of $\\Lambda$CDM. A caveat is that for both $w_0 w_a$ and $V_0 V_1$, much of the significance relies on the historical $z < 0.1$ supernova samples included in the DES-SN5YR data set.",

However, our knowledge of the post-inflation reheating phase remains limited due to its small-scale dynamics. Traditional observations, such as those of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), primarily provide insights into large-scale dynamics, making it challenging to glean information about the reheating era. In this paper, our primary aim is to explore how the generation of Gravitational Waves (GWs) spectra, resulting from electromagnetic fields in the early universe, can offer valuable insights into the Reheating dynamics. We investigate how the spectral shape of GWs varies across different frequency ranges, depending on the initial magnetic profile and reheating dynamics. For this, we consider a well-known non-helical magnetogenesis model, where the usual electromagnetic kinetic term is coupled with a background scalar. Notably, for such a scenario, we observe distinct spectral shapes with sufficiently high amplitudes for different reheating histories with the equation of state parametrized by ($w_{\\rm re}$). We identify spectral breaks in the GW spectra for both $w_{\\rm re}<1/3$ and $w_{\\rm re}>1/3$ scenarios. We find that future GW experiments such as BBO, LISA, SKA, and DECIGO are well within the reach of observing those distinct spectral shapes and can potentially shed light on the underlying mechanism of the reheating phase.",

Meena, James Nianias, Hayley Williams, Liliya L.R. Williams, Adi Zitrin, Thomas J. Broadhurst 12 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The extreme magnification from galaxy clusters and microlenses therein allows the detection of individual, luminous stars in lensed galaxies as transient events, and hence provides a valuable window into the high mass stellar population in $z>1$ galaxies. As these bright stars can only be formed at specific ages, the relative abundance of transient events at blue (B) and red (R) optical wavelengths ($B/R$ ratio) can provide insights into the recent star formation history of galaxies that are not well constrained by their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Here, we forward model the transient detection rates in an idealized mock scenario to find that the $B/R$ ratio of strongly lensed $z>1$ galaxies decreases quickly with increasing age. This ratio has moderate sensitivity to metallicity and comparatively low sensitivity to dust attenuation, with no significant dependency on the stellar initial mass function. Fitting model stellar populations to either the SED or $B/R$ ratio alone of ``Warhol'' arc ($z = 0.94$), we find that neither a simple single starburst nor a more complex star formation can simultaneously reproduce both constraints. We then demonstrate that a best-fit model constrained by both the B/R ratio and SED requires a star-formation rate that has varied quite dramatically over the past $\\sim$50 Myr, for which the total stellar mass formed over this time is a factor of 10 (with $2-3\\sigma$ significance) different from the best-fit models to the SED alone. Our work shows that the transient $B/R$ ratio can be used as an additional powerful constraint on the recent star formation history of higher-redshift galaxies in future works that are strongly lensed by galaxy clusters.",

However, in the neighborhood of massive foreground clusters, a large number of background galaxies can be significantly distorted. The measurement of such large shear signals could be quite nontrivial under general observing conditions, i.e., in the presence of the point spread function (PSF) and noise. In this work, we propose a non-perturbative method to exactly recover large shear signals ($\\gtrsim 0.5$) under general conditions. We test the method on simulated galaxy images, and find that it is accurate down to the very faint end. This new method is particularly useful for more accurate recovery of the shear distribution in the neighborhood of massive foreground clusters, thereby improving the modeling of the underlying dark matter halo properties.",

Forming 10^9 Solar Mass SMBHs by z=6 is challenging and may require hierarchical mergers of smaller seed black holes. We extend a semi-analytic seed model by explicitly incorporating GW recoil physics. Our model includes: (1) recoil velocity formulae calibrated to numerical relativity for spinning, unequal-mass BH binaries (Campanelli2007,Lousto2012); (2) assignment of spin magnitudes and orientations based on seed type (Population III remnant, stellar cluster, or direct-collapse); and (3) a retention probability scheme comparing the recoil speed to the host halo escape velocity. We find that including GW recoil reduces final SMBH masses by approximately 20-30% by z=6 and creates a population of off-nuclear (``wandering'') BHs amounting to a few percent of the total. Observable consequences include spatial offsets approximately 0.1'' and line-of-sight velocity shifts approximately 10^2-10^3 km\\s in a few-percent of high-redshift quasars.

Using JAX-based neural emulators and likelihoods for cosmic microwave background and cosmic shear analyses, our approach provides parameter constraints and direct calculation of Bayesian evidence. In the 39-dimensional $\\Lambda$CDM vs $w_0w_a$ shear analysis, we produce Bayes factors and a robust error bar in just 2 days on a single A100 GPU, without loss of accuracy. Where CPU-based nested sampling can now be outpaced by methods relying on MCMC sampling and decoupled evidence estimation, we demonstrate that with GPU acceleration nested sampling offers the necessary speed-up to put it on equal computational footing with these methods, especially where reliable model comparison is paramount. We also explore interpolation in the matter power spectrum for cosmic shear analysis, finding a further factor of 4 speed-up with consistent posterior contours and Bayes factor. We put forward both nested and gradient-based sampling as useful tools for the modern cosmologist, where cutting-edge inference pipelines can yield orders of magnitude improvements in computation time.",

Models of the lens masses are a necessary component of this analysis. To enable time-delay cosmography from a sample of $\\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ lenses, which will soon become available from surveys like the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the Euclid Wide Survey, we require fast and standardizable modeling techniques. To address this need, we apply neural posterior estimation (NPE) for modeling galaxy-scale strongly lensed quasars from the Strong Lensing Insights into the Dark Energy Survey (STRIDES) sample. NPE brings two advantages: speed and the ability to implicitly marginalize over nuisance parameters. We extend this method by employing sequential NPE to increase precision of mass model posteriors. We then fold individual lens models into a hierarchical Bayesian inference to recover the population distribution of lens mass parameters, accounting for out-of-distribution shift. After verifying our method using simulated analogs of the STRIDES lens sample, we apply our method to 14 Hubble Space Telescope single-filter observations. We find the population mean of the power-law elliptical mass distribution slope, $\\gamma_{\\text{lens}}$, to be $\\mathcal{M}_{\\gamma_{\\text{lens}}}=2.13 \\pm 0.06$.

However, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) finally opened new concrete prospects for their detection during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), notably providing promising observational constraints on the Pop III ultra-violet luminosity function (UVLF) at $z \\approx 5.6 - 6.6$. These preliminary data hint towards an unexpected population of UV-bright Pop III sources, which challenges the prevailing view that Pop III star formation is confined to molecular-cooling mini-halos. Here we show that there are two families of models that can explain these surprising observations, either by allowing for late-time Pop III formation within massive, atomic-cooling halos (with halo masses up to $M^\\mathrm{III}_\\mathrm{up} \\gtrsim 10^{10} \\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$) or by invoking a highly bursty Pop III star-formation activity (with a stochasticity parameter $\\sigma^\\mathrm{III}_\\mathrm{UV} \\gtrsim 1.5$). In these scenarios, Pop III systems would have to be either heavier or burstier than usually assumed, underscoring the need to reconsider common assumptions about Pop III star-formation sites, and the potential implications of JWST candidates for current and future observations.",

Macera, M. Branchesi, L. Nava, S. Mohnani, S. Agarwal, A. Shukla Comments are welcome, to be submitted soon High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) generate powerful relativistic jets that inject a large amount of energy into their surrounding environment, producing blast waves that accelerate particles to high energies. The GRB afterglow radiation provides a powerful means to investigate the microphysics of relativistic shocks and to probe the medium surrounding the progenitor of the burst. In this study, we present a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis of 31 GRBs observed between 2008 and 2024 from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (X-ray Telescope and Burst Alert Telescope) and the Fermi Large Area Telescope, covering photon energies from 0.3 keV to 300 GeV. Our goal is to characterize the broadband spectral properties of GRB afterglows in soft X-rays, hard X-rays, and high-energy gamma rays. We investigate correlations between spectral shape and energy output across different parts of the spectrum. The observed emission is modeled using a forward shock scenario that includes both synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) radiation losses. The results favor an SSC-dominated radiation model in a wind-like medium, consistent with expectations for long-duration GRBs. Crucially, this work provides new benchmarks for the microphysical parameters governing the emission, particularly indicating a notably low magnetic energy fraction, which refines previous estimates. By modeling broadband data, this study offers one of the most detailed SSC analyses in a wind-like environment to date. Notably, our results naturally account for the comparable energy output observed in both the soft X-ray and TeV bands, consistent with the previously detected TeV-GRBs.",

Marshall 13 pages, 5 Figures, 6 Tables, Accepted for publication in APJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We report the first polarimetric results of the neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) Z-source GX 17+2 using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) and the Very Large Array (VLA). We find that the X-ray source was polarized at PD = 1.9 +/- 0.3 % (1-sigma errors) with a polarization angle of PA = 11 +/- 4 degree (1-sigma errors). Simultaneous Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) observations show that the source was in the normal branch (NB) during our IXPE observations. The X-ray spectro-polarimetry results suggest a source geometry comprising an accretion disk component, a Comptonization component, and a reflection component. The VLA radio polarization study shows a PD = 2.2 +/- 0.2 % with a Faraday-corrected intrinsic polarization angle of 1 +/- 5 degree, which is an indication of the jet axis. Thus, we find the estimated X-ray PA from the source is consistent with the radio PA. We discuss the accretion geometry of the Z-source in light of our X-ray spectro-polarimetry and radio findings.",

Article for the Encyclopedia of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Editor Ilya Mandel, Section Editor Jeff Andrews High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Gamma-ray bursts are flashes of high-energy radiation lasting from a fraction of a second to several hours. Military satellites made the first detections of GRBs in the late 1960s. The $\\gamma$-ray emission forms from shocks in a relativistic jet launched from a compact central engine. In addition to the emission of $\\gamma$-rays, the interaction of the jet with the surrounding medium yields afterglow emission that can be observed across the electromagnetic spectrum. Redshift measurements from these afterglows place GRBs from the local to the distant Universe. The central engines of GRBs are thought to be either a hyperaccreting black hole or a highly magnetized neutron star (magnetar). There is now strong observational evidence that this central engine is created either in the core collapse of a rapidly rotating massive star or via the merger of two compact objects (neutron stars or a neutron star with a black hole). The combination of stellar scale events with extreme energies and luminosities makes GRBs powerful probes of the extreme physics involved in their production and of other areas of astrophysics and cosmology. These include as the electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave sources, the production and acceleration of relativistic jets, the synthesis of heavy elements, the study of the interstellar and intergalactic medium, and the identification of the collapse of early generations of stars.",

Accepted for publication in Physical Review D High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Scalar-tensor gravity models are among the prime candidates to explain cosmic acceleration, and compact stars provide unique laboratories for testing such theories. Predictions of scalar-tensor gravity in compact stars can be examined during the evolution of neutron stars. Spontaneous scalarization in relativistic stars is influenced by different properties of stellar matter in various evolution regimes. In the present study, we investigate the scalarization of neutron stars in different stages of the evolvement. For this aim, we apply the isentropic equations of state for the neutron star matter including nucleons, hyperons, and $\\Delta$- resonances in neutrino-trapped, neutrino diffusion, and neutrino-transparent stages as well as cold-catalyzed neutron star. Our equations of state are based on the relativistic model within the mean-field approximation. To emphasize the role of scalar-tensor theories in exploring the properties and structure of compact stars, we calculate the structure of neutron stars with hyperons and $\\Delta$-resonances in different snapshots of the neutron star evolution in the scalar-tensor gravity. Our calculations confirm that the neutron star scalarization is affected by the hyperons as well as the $\\Delta$-resonances. Moreover, the properties of scalarized neutron stars depend on the stage of the star evolution.",

      "abstract": "On the statistical characterization of the synchrotron multi-zone polarization of blazars Andrea Tramacere accepted for publication in A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Multiwavelength polarimetric observations of blazars reveal complex, energy-dependent polarization behavior, including a decrease in polarization fraction from X-rays to millimeter bands and significant variability in the electric vector position angle (EVPA). These trends challenge simple single-zone synchrotron models and suggest a more intricate, turbulent jet structure with multiple emission zones. We develop a statistical framework to model the observed energy-dependent polarization patterns in blazars, focusing on the behavior captured by IXPE in the X-ray band and RoboPol in the optical. The goal is to statistically characterize multi-zone models in terms of the distributions of cell size and the physical parameters of the electron energy distribution (EED). A Monte Carlo approach, implemented with the JetSeT code, is used to generate synthetic multi-zone synchrotron emission from a spherical region filled with turbulent cells with randomly distributed physical properties. Simulations explore scenarios ranging from identical cells to power-law distributions of cell sizes and EED parameters with variable cutoff and low-energy slopes. The results show that a purely turbulent, multi-zone model can reproduce the observed energy-dependent polarization without requiring correlations between cell size and EED parameters. The polarization degree is primarily determined by the effective, flux-weighted, number of emitting cells, modulated by the dispersion in cell properties, particularly the EED cutoff energy at high frequencies and the low-energy spectral index at low frequencies. With a fractional dispersion in cutoff energy of about 90% and a low-energy spectral index dispersion of ~0.5-1.5, the model reproduces the chromatic mm-to-X-ray polarization trends seen by IXPE and the optical polarization limiting envelope observed in the RoboPol dataset.",

McCully 17 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present the analysis of the luminous Type II Supernova (SN) 2021tsz, which exploded in a low-luminosity galaxy. It reached a peak magnitude of -18.88 $\\pm$ 0.13 mag in the $r$ band and exhibited an initial rapid decline of 4.05 $\\pm$ 0.14 mag (100 d)$^{-1}$ from peak luminosity till $\\sim$30 d. The photospheric phase is short, with the SN displaying bluer colours and a weak H$\\alpha$ absorption component--features consistent with other luminous, short-photospheric phase Type II SNe. A distinct transition from the photospheric to the radioactive tail phase in the $V$ band--as is common in hydrogen-rich Type II SNe--is not visible in SN 2021tsz, although a modest $\\sim$1 mag drop is apparent in the redder filters. Hydrodynamic modelling suggests the luminosity is powered by ejecta-circumstellar material (CSM) interaction during the early phases (<30 days). Interaction with 0.6 M$_\\odot$ of dense CSM extending to 3100 R$_\\odot$ reproduces the observed luminosity, with an explosion energy of 1.3$\\times$10$^{51}$ erg. The modelling indicates a pre-SN mass of 9 M$_\\odot$, which includes a hydrogen envelope of 4 M$_\\odot$, and a radius of $\\sim$1000 R$_\\odot$. Spectral energy distribution analysis and strong-line diagnostics reveal that the host galaxy of SN 2021tsz is a low-metallicity, dwarf galaxy. The low-metallicity environment and the derived high mass loss from the hydrodynamical modelling strongly support a binary progenitor system for SN 2021tsz.",

In addition to spanning large redshift ($0<z\\lesssim 4$) and luminosity ranges ($2.9\\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ - $7.3\\times10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$), this sample also has a robust calculation of the detection efficiency associated with its observation, making its selection effects and biases well understood. We confirm that the local luminosity function is best explained by a double power law. The evolution of the luminosity function of FSRQs follows a luminosity-dependent density evolution. FSRQs experience positive evolution with their space density growing with increasing redshift up to a maximum redshift, after which the numbers decrease. This peak in redshift occurs at larger redshifts for higher luminosity sources and at lower redshifts for lower luminosity sources. We find an unexpected similarity between the luminosity function of FSRQs and that of BL Lacertae objects at intermediate luminosity. This could be a sign of a strong genetic link between the two blazar sub-classes or that BL Lac samples are contaminated by large amounts of FSRQs with their jets nearly perfectly aligned with our line of sight.",

Using the Gaussian process method, we applied an additive composite kernel model consisting of an SHO, a DRW, and an additional white noise (AWN) to data from three energy bands: LE (1-10 keV), ME (10-30 keV), and HE (30-150 keV). We find that for the DRW component, correlations on the timescale of $\\tau_{\\rm DRW}\\sim10$ s are absent in the LE band, while they persist in the ME and HE bands over the full duration of the light curves. This energy-dependent behavior may reflect thermal instabilities, with the shorter correlation timescale in the disk compared to the corona. Alternatively, it may reflect variable Comptonizations of seed photons from different disk regions. Inner-disk photons are scattered by a small inner corona, producing soft X-rays. Outer-disk photons interact with an extended, jet-like corona, resulting in harder emission. The QPO is captured by an SHO component with a stable period of $\\sim 0.2$ s and a high quality factor of $\\sim 10$. The absence of significant evolution with energy or time of the SHO component suggests a connection between the accretion disk and the corona, which may be built by coherent oscillations of disk-corona driven by magnetorotational instability. The AWN components are present in all the three-band data and dominate over the DRW and SHO components. We interpret the AWN as another fast DRW with its $\\tau_{\\rm DRW} < 0.01$ s. It may trace high-frequency fluctuations that occur in both the inner region of the accretion disk and the corona. Overall, our work reveals a timescale hierarchy in the coupled disk-corona scenario: fast DRW < SHO < disk DRW < corona DRW.",

Our multiwavelength light curve analysis reveals flux variations across X-ray to optical/UV bands, with an increased variability amplitude at shorter wavelengths. X-ray spectral analysis indicates the presence of intrinsic absorption during the 2016 and 2022 observations; however, this absorption disappeared before and after these epochs. The presence and absence of the absorber are attributed to clouds moving in and out of the line of sight. During the long-term monitoring period, the bolometric luminosity of the source varies between ($1.32-17)\\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Optical spectroscopic monitoring reveals changing-look (CL) behaviour in NGC~3822, characterized by the appearance and disappearance of broad emission lines (BELs). These CL transitions are associated with changes in the Eddington ratio rather than changes in the obscuration. The BELs appear only when the Eddington ratio is relatively high ($\\sim 3.8\\times10^{-3}$) and disappear when it drops to a lower value ($\\sim 0.9\\times10^{-3}$).",

Glowacki 12 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, submitted to PASA High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The intrinsic width and scattering distributions of fast radio bursts (FRBs) inform on their emission mechanism and local environment, and act as a source of detection bias and, hence, an obfuscating factor when performing FRB population and cosmological studies. Here, we utilise a sample of 29 FRBs with measured high-time-resolution properties and known redshift, which were detected using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) by the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients Survey (CRAFT), to model these distributions. Using this sample, we estimate the completeness bias of intrinsic width and scattering measurements, and fit the underlying, de-biased distributions in the host rest-frame. We find no evidence for a down-turn towards high values of the intrinsic distributions of either parameter in the 0.01-40 ms range probed by the data. Rather, the intrinsic scattering distribution at 1 GHz is consistent with a log-uniform distribution above 0.04 ms, while the intrinsic width distribution rises as a Gaussian in log-space in the 0.03-0.3 ms range, and is then log-uniform above that. This is inconsistent with previous works, which assumed that these parameters have lognormal distributions. This confirms that FRB observations are currently strongly width- and scattering-limited, and we encourage FRB searches to be extended to higher values of time-width. It also implies a bias in FRB host galaxy studies, although the form of that bias is uncertain. Finally, we find that our updated width and scattering model - when implemented in the zDM code - produces 10% more FRBs at redshift $z=1$ than at $z=0$ when compared to alternative width/scattering models, highlighting that these factors are important to understand when performing FRB population modelling.",

Ventura, E. Visentin (for the MAGIC Collaboration) Proceedings of the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC2025), Geneva, Switzerland High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Extremely high-peaked BL Lac objects (or extreme blazars) are unique extragalactic laboratories where particle acceleration processes are pushed at their physical limits. In these blazars, synchrotron emission peaking above keV energies is reprocessed to very-high-energy (VHE, energies > 100 GeV) gamma rays, often resulting in very hard TeV spectra. Over the past two decades, they have attracted a growing interest from the scientific community, both experimentally and theoretically, as crucial targets for understanding the diversity within the blazar class. On the experimental side, new sources have been detected and characterized, populating the extreme blazars class. Notably, VHE campaigns have revealed evidence of emerging spectral differences in this energy band, suggesting inhomogeneity within this class of sources. Recent studies have also unveiled intriguing differences in the temporal evolution of their spectral emission. On the theoretical side, these spectral differences are challenging the current standard emission and acceleration models for blazars, suggesting the need for more complex theoretical frameworks. In this contribution, we present the latest results from recent MAGIC Collaboration observing campaigns aimed to enlarge the extreme blazars population at VHE and understand the origin of their extreme properties. Furthermore, we will present the results of the most recent observations, discussing analogies and differences with well-known sources such as the archetypal 1ES 0229+200, as well as interpretations of their non-conventional spectral emission.",

While current methods are limited in their ability to exploit correlations in complex data, deep learning-based models offer a promising alternative by directly leveraging image-level information. However, several challenges involving the robustness and applicability of such models remain. Designing model architectures with inductive biases relevant for the task can help mitigate the problem. Three such deep learning-based models are proposed, trained, and evaluated on simulated data: (1) a hybrid convolutional and graph neural network model (CNN-GNN) using both image and graph data; (2) an enhanced CNN-GNN variant that incorporates additional reconstructed information within the graph construction; and (3) a graph neural network (GNN) model using image moments serving as a baseline. The new combined convolution and graph-based approach demonstrates improved performance over traditional methods, and the inclusion of reconstructed information offers further potential in generalization capabilities on real observational data.",

      "abstract": "Radio emission from beyond the light cylinder in millisecond pulsars Michael Kramer (MPIfR), Simon Johnston (CSIRO) High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) A striking aspect of the radio profiles of many millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is that they consist of components separated from each other by regions lacking in emission. We devise a technique for determining \"disjoint\" from \"contiguous\" components and show that 35% of MSPs have disjoint components as opposed to only 3% of the slow pulsar population. We surmise that the pulsars with these disjoint components show evidence for both emission above the polar cap and from the current sheet beyond the light cylinder, co-located with gamma-ray emission. For a sub-class of radio MSPs only the light cylinder emission is being observed. It is our contention that almost all of the current population of gamma-ray MSPs show evidence for co-located radio emission. A simple geometric explanation allows the presence (or not) of light cylinder emission and the relationship (or not) between the gamma-ray and radio profiles to be determined. The light-cylinder components have frequently very high polarization and typically flat position-angle traverses thus helping to explain the difficulties in determining the geometry of MSPs. In cases where the geometry can be determined the values broadly align with expectations. If our picture is correct, the beaming fraction of radio MSPs is higher than previously thought and a mechanism is required to produce coherent radio emission far from the stellar surface. This has implications for our understanding of the populations of radio-loud and radio-quiet rotation-powered millisecond pulsars, and could relate to the timing stability of some of these sources.",

Considering beamed active galactic nuclei, i.e., blazars, only a small fraction, mainly high synchrotron peak BL Lacs, have been detected in the VHE band with the ground-based Cherenkov telescopes. We utilized $\\sim$16 years of Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations in the 0.1$-$2 TeV energy range to systematically search for potential VHE emitters in a sample of high synchrotron peaked ($\\nu^{\\rm peak}_{\\rm syn}>10^{15}$ Hz) BL Lac sources. We identified, for the first time, 92 VHE emitting blazars at $\\geq 5\\sigma$ confidence level. A significant VHE emission was also detected from 52 objects, which have been previously reported to be a VHE blazar. Comparing with the general blazar population, these VHE emitting blazars are found to be located at low redshifts (mean $z=0.2 \\pm 0.1$) and exhibit bright synchrotron emission ($\\log F^{\\rm peak}_{\\rm syn}=-11.2 \\pm 0.4$, in erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$). We also investigated the coincidence of VHE photon arrivals with the source activity states and found that Fermi-LAT has detected VHE photons during both quiescent and elevated activity epochs. These VHE emitting blazars represent promising targets for current and next-generation ground-based Cherenkov telescopes, and provide valuable laboratories for probing particle acceleration in relativistic jets, testing multi-messenger connections, and constraining extragalactic background light models.",

Donato, D. Hartmann, A. Strong High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We evaluate the contribution to the Isotropic Gamma-Ray Background (IGRB) coming from Radio Galaxies (RGs), the subclass of radio-loud Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with the highest misalignment from the line of sight (l.o.s.). Since only a small number of RGs are detected in gamma rays compared to the largest known radio population, the correlation between radio and gamma-ray emission serves as a crucial tool to characterize the gamma-ray properties of these sources. We analyse the population of RGs using two samples. The first sample contains 26 sources individually detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope at gamma rays. The second sample contains 210 RGs for which the gamma-ray emission is not significantly detected by the LAT. We use a stacking analysis to characterize the average properties of the gamma-ray emission of the two samples, separately at first and then combined. We then evaluate the correlation between their gamma-ray emission and the emission from their radio core at 5 GHz, and we use it to determine their contribution to the IGRB. Due to the limited number of RGs detected at the gamma-rays, information on the gamma-ray luminosity function is limited. The correlation between the gamma-ray emission and the emission of the radio core allows us to characterize it starting from the luminosity function of the radio cores, which is modeled with greater accuracy due to the larger number of sources detected at these frequencies. We find that the diffuse emission as extrapolated from the properties of the subthreshold RGs is lower than the one inferred from detected RGs, showing that the contribution of the population of RGs to the IGRB is lower than the previous estimates and it is around the 30% level of the IGRB intensity.",

Recent measurements reveal anisotropies in arrival directions, a rigidity-dependent composition dominated by intermediate-mass nuclei, and striking hemispheric differences in the energy spectra. Here we show that rare transients in nearby galaxies can naturally account for these features. In our fiducial neutron-star merger model, the cosmic ray flux above $25$ EeV is dominated by ten nearby galaxies within $8\\,$Mpc. This accounts for the observed hotspots: seven of the ten brightest galaxies coincide with reported excess regions, a chance probability of $p\\simeq0.003$.

Hygate, Sophie Venselaar, Junzhi Wang, Zhiyu Zhang Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Context: Most active galactic nuclei (AGN) are believed to be surrounded by a dusty molecular torus on the parsec scale which is often embedded within a larger circumnuclear disk (CND). AGN are fuelled by the inward transport of material through these structures and can launch multi-phase outflows that influence the host galaxy through AGN feedback. Aims: We use the Circinus Galaxy as a nearby laboratory to investigate the physical mechanisms responsible for feeding the torus and launching a multi-phase outflow in this Seyfert-type AGN, as these mechanisms remain poorly understood. Methods: We analysed observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array of the Circinus nucleus at angular resolutions down to 13 mas (0.25 pc). We traced dust and the ionised outflow using 86-665 GHz continuum emission, and studied the morphology and kinematics of the molecular gas. Results: We find that the Circinus CND hosts molecular and dusty spiral arms, two of which connect directly to the torus. We detect inward mass transport along these structures and argue that the non-axisymmetric potential generated by these arms is the mechanism responsible for fuelling the torus. We estimate a feeding rate of 0.3-7.5 M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, implying that over 88% of the inflowing material is expelled in a multi-phase outflow before reaching the accretion disk. The inferred torus feeding time scale (120 kyr - 2.7 Myr) suggests that variability in AGN activity may be driven by changes in torus feeding. On parsec scales, the ionised outflow is traced by optically thin free-free emission. The outflow is stratified, with a slightly wider opening angle in the molecular phase than in the dusty and ionised components. The ionised outflow is launched or collimated by a warped accretion disk at a radius of r ~ 0.16 pc, and its geometry requires an anisotropic launching mechanism.",

Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics and updated following comments from the referee Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Feedback from Young Massive Clusters (YMCs) is an important driver of galaxy evolution. In the first few Myr, mechanical feedback is dominated by collective effects of the massive stellar winds in the YMC. The mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities of these stars change by orders of magnitude over pre-SN timescales as the massive stars evolve, and mass-loss rates of Cool Supergiant (CSG) stars in particular are uncertain by a factor $\\sim~20$ or more. In this work we perform a first study of the time evolution of average cluster wind velocity $\\bar{V}_{\\mathrm{cl}}$ as a function of stellar metallicity $Z$, assuming single star evolution. We also check the validity of assuming Wolf-Rayet stars dominate the feedback effects of a YMC, as often done when interpreting X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray observations, and test how sensitive $\\bar{V}_{\\mathrm{cl}}$ is to current uncertainties in mass-loss rates. We use pySTARBURST99 to calculate integrated properties of YMCs for $Z$ in the range of $0.0004-0.02$, representing a range of environments from IZw18 to the Galactic Centre. We find that $\\bar{V}_{\\mathrm{cl}}$ drops off rapidly for sub-LMC $Z$, and we recommend a value of $500-1000\\,~\\textrm{km~s}^{-1}$ be used in this regime.

Gnedin, Yingtian Chen, Matthias Weber, Timon Thomas, Christoph Pfrommer Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Star clusters host the massive stars responsible for feedback in star-forming galaxies. Stellar feedback shapes the interstellar medium (ISM), affecting the formation of future star clusters. To self-consistently capture the interplay between feedback and star formation, a model must resolve the parsec-scale star formation sites and the multiphase ISM. Additionally, the dynamical impact of cosmic rays (CRs) on star formation rates (SFRs) must also be considered. We present the first simulations of the formation of an ensemble of star clusters with dynamically-coupled CRs, near-individual star particles, and a feedback-regulated ISM. We analyze tallbox simulations performed using the CRISP model in the moving-mesh code AREPO. We apply varied implementations of CR transport under the theory of self-confinement. We find that CRs simultaneously reduce the SFR, the power law slope of the cluster mass function, and the cluster formation efficiency. Each simulation is compatible with observations, and CR feedback tends to move results along observed star cluster relations. We see only modest changes in cluster radius and velocity dispersions, but significant differences in the virial parameters. Ultimately, the primary impact of CRs is to reduce SFRs. Lower SFRs imply fewer supernovae, and consequently a lower turbulent energy budget for gas. Star clusters formed in a CR-regulated ISM have lower velocity dispersions, and are therefore more bound under self-gravity. The effective clustering of SNe is unchanged by CRs. Through this work, we demonstrate the predictive power of the CRISP feedback model, despite this idealized setup.",

McSweeney 20 pages, 17 figures, Accepted for publication in PASA High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We report detection and analysis of the largest low-frequency (200 - 231.25 MHz) sample of Crab giant pulses (GPs) reported in the literature. In total about 95000 GPs were detected. The observations were performed in 2024/2025 with the EDA2, a prototype station of the SKA-Low telescope. The fluence distribution of GPs in the entire sample is very well characterised with a single power law (no flattening at higher fluences) N(F) $\\propto$ F$^\\alpha$, where $\\alpha = -3.17\\pm0.02$ for all GPs, and $\\alpha_{MP} = -3.13\\pm0.02$ and $\\alpha_{IP} = -3.59\\pm0.06$ for GPs at the phases of the main pulse and interpulse respectively. The index of the power law fluence distribution remained approximately constant over the observing period, but the normalisation of the distribution was strongly correlated with the scatter broadening time ($\\tau$). As a result, the measured fluence distribution increased for lower ($\\tau \\approx$ 2 ms) and decreased for higher ($\\tau \\approx$ 5 ms) scatter broadening time $\\tau$ causing the GP rate to vary between 3000 and 100 per hour respectively. The timescale of variations (weeks) indicates refractive scintillation as the root cause. We also observe a strong positive correlation between the scatter broadening time and dispersion measure. Our modelling favours the screen of the size $\\sim10^{-5}$ pc and mean electron density $\\sim 400$e$^{-}$cm$^{-3}$ located within 100 pc from the pulsar. The frequency scaling of the scattering broadening time ($\\tau \\propto \\nu^{\\beta}$) with $\\beta \\approx -3.6\\pm0.1$ is in agreement with earlier measurements. Our results agree with the current views that GPs from extra-galactic Crab-like pulsars can be responsible for very weak repeating FRBs, but cannot explain the entire FRB population. Finally, these results demonstrate an enormous scientific potential of individual SKA-Low stations.",

It has two key features: (1) it can immediately check the visibility of Fermi-GBM for new transients, and (2) it can check the light curve and perform spectral analysis after the hourly Time-Tagger Event data are released. The visibility check and the response matrix generation required for spectral analysis can be achieved through the historical pointing file after the orbit calculation, even when the real-time pointing file is not yet available. As a case study, we apply the tool to EP240617a, an X-ray transient triggered by Einstein Probe (EP). We demonstrate the workflow of visibility checking, data processing, and spectral analysis for this event. The results suggest that EP240617a can be classified as an X-ray-rich gamma-ray burst (XRR) and confirm the feasibility of using historical pointing files for rapid analysis. Further, we discuss possible physical interpretations of such events, including implications for jet launching and progenitor scenarios. Therefore, {\\tt RapidGBM} is expected to assist EP Transient Advocates, Space-based multiband astronomical Variable Objects Monitor burst advocates, and other members of the community in cross checking high-energy transients. Based on prompt emission parameter relations (e.g. $E_{\\rm p}$-$E_{\\gamma,\\rm iso}$), it can also help identify peculiar GRBs (e.g. long-short burst, magnetar giant flare, etc.) and provide useful references (e.g. more accurate $T_0$) for scheduling follow-up observations.",

Barkov, Conrad Chan, David Liptai, Shigehiro Nagataki 22 pages, 18 figures, accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present 3D hydrodynamical modelling of supernova-induced binary-interaction-powered supernovae; a scenario proposed for the peculiar type Ic supernova SN2022jli. In this scenario, supernova ejecta of a stripped-envelope star impact a close-by stellar companion, temporarily inflating the envelope. The expanded envelope engulfs the neutron star, causing strong mass accretion at super-Eddington rates. Feedback from the accretion powers the supernova light curve with periodic undulations. Our simulations capture key features of SN2022jli, both the overall decline and the superimposed undulations of the light curve. Based on our parameter study, we find that (i) the accretion feedback should be sufficiently geometrically confined and (ii) the eccentricity of the post-supernova binary orbit should be $0.8\\lesssim e\\lesssim0.9$ to sustain a high accretion rate and match the low undulation amplitude ($\\Delta L/L\\sim0.1$) of SN2022jli. Different combinations of parameters could account for other supernovae like SN2022mop, SN2009ip and SN2015ap, which have varying undulation periods and amplitudes. We also discuss possible explanations for other key features of SN2022jli such as the $\\gamma$-ray detection at $\\sim200~\\mathrm{d}$ and the rapid optical drop at $\\sim250~\\mathrm{d}$. Finally, we speculate on the future evolution of the system and its relation to existing neutron star binaries.",

Whether such a transition can be directly tested with improved observations is a key challenge. Here, we incorporate the latest constraints, especially a new NICER radius measurement for PSR J0614--3329, into a nonparametric Gaussian Process (GP) EOS framework that explicitly includes a first-order transition. We find a Bayes factor of $B\\approx2.3$ when comparing models with and without an explicit phase transition, marginally favoring its presence. At $68\\%$ credibility, the transition onset density $n_{\\rm PT}$ is either below $2\\,n_s$ (corresponding to masses $\\lesssim1\\,M_\\odot$, with density jump $\\Delta n\\sim0.5\\,n_s$) or, more prominently, above $4\\,n_s$ (near the central density of the heaviest NS, with $\\Delta n\\sim3\\,n_s$), where $n_s$ represents the nuclear saturation density. In addition, by using symmetry-energy expansion at low densities ($<1.1\\,n_s$), we infer a slope parameter $L=40.2^{+19.3}_{-14.3}$ MeV, in good agreement with nuclear-experiment values. Intriguingly, $L$ correlates positively with the radius difference between $1.4\\,M_\\odot$ and $2.0\\,M_\\odot$ stars.",

In this approach the Green function is not a Gaussian but it exhibits power-law tails. By using the propagator appropriate for non-classical diffusion, it is found for the first time that energy spectral index of particles accelerated at shock front is $\\gamma = [\\alpha (\\mathrm{r} + 5) - 6 \\beta]/[\\alpha(\\mathrm{r}-1)]$, where $0 < \\alpha < 2$ and $0 <\\beta < 1$ are the exponents of power-law behavior of Lévy flights and Lévy traps, respectively.

Spectral line and physical parameter data will be made available on the CDS upon publication Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Supernova remnants (SNRs) are the aftermath of massive stellar explosions or of a white dwarf in a binary system, representing critical phases in the life cycle of stars and playing an important role in galactic evolution. Physical properties of SNRs such as their shock velocity, density and age are important elements for constraining models for their evolution and understanding the physical processes responsible for their morphological appearance and emission processes. Our study provides, for the first time, a comprehensive statistical analysis of the physical parameters in 64 Galactic SNRs both as a population as well as regions within individual objects. These 64 objects represent the subset of the 310 known Galactic SNRs for which there are published optical data, from which we compiled their physical parameters through an exhaustive literature survey. Through a systematic statistical analysis accounting for uncertainties and/or upper and lower limits in these parameters we obtain distributions of the electron density and shock velocity in the studied SNRs and regions within them. This information is combined with constraints on their age and type. Analysis of electron density and shock velocity distributions for the entire sample of SNRs shows that they are consistent with a log-normal distribution and a skewed log-normal distribution, respectively. Within individual remnants, our study reveals that electron density and shock velocity show larger scatter in younger objects, reflecting the varying conditions of the ambient medium immediately surrounding the explosion epicenter and their impact on SNR evolution. Comparison of the dependence of the shock velocity and density on the supernova age with expectations from theoretical models shows good agreement.",

We validate our (kpc-scale) $\\alpha_\\mathrm{CO}$ predictions against observational estimates, finding the best agreement when accounting for CO-dark gas as well as CO emissivity and excitation effects. The CO-dark correction plays a primary role in lower-mass galaxies, whereas CO emissivity and excitation effects become more important in higher-mass and more actively star-forming galaxies, respectively. We compare our estimated $\\alpha_\\mathrm{CO}$ to observed galaxy-integrated SFR to CO luminosity ratio as a function of $M_\\star$.

Naidu, Minghao Yue 17 pages, 8 Figures, Submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate the association between galaxies and neutral OI absorption systems at z~6, which trace metal-enriched gas during the epoch of reionization. We identify 40 galaxies across six quasar fields, residing in 15 overdensities within 300 kpc of the background sightlines. Five OI absorption systems are associated with five of these overdensities, yielding a covering fraction of $0.27^{+0.13}_{-0.10}$ within 300 kpc. The absorption occurs beyond typical virial radii, indicating that the gas traces extended overdensity environments rather than individual galaxy halos, unlike the z~0 CGM which is largely bound to halos. These galaxy-associated absorbers account for $\\sim35\\%$ of all OI systems seen in blind quasar surveys, implying the remainder arise in lower-mass galaxies below our detection threshold or in dense neutral IGM pockets. The CGM around these galaxies contains $\\gtrsim 2\\times10^6~M_{\\odot}$ of oxygen, comparable to the ISM oxygen mass of the galaxies themselves, suggesting that the surrounding environment holds as much metal mass as the galaxies. All five galaxy-associated systems show significantly higher $\\log(N_{\\rm CII}/N_{\\rm OI})$ ratios than absorbers lacking galaxy associations. Furthermore, relative abundance ratios ([Si/O], [C/O]) reveal that four of the five exhibit enrichment patterns consistent with Population III nucleosynthesis. These rare systems offer a unique window into the role of first-generation stars in shaping the early metal enrichment of galaxies and their environments.",

      "abstract": "Constraints on Radial Gas Flows in the Milky Way Disk Revealed by Large Stellar Age Catalogs James W. Johnson 15 figures, 29 pages, 1 appendix. Submitted to AAS Journals. Comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Disk galaxies like the Milky Way are expected to experience gas flows carrying matter toward their centers. This paper investigates the role of these radial gas flows in models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). We follow five different parameterizations of the Galactocentric radial velocity, $v_{r,g}$, of the interstellar medium (ISM). Relative to the $v_{r,g}=0$ limit, all models predict stellar metallicity to decline less significantly with age in the outer disk and more significantly in the inner disk. This outcome arises because radial flows cannot remove gas from one region of the Galaxy without placing it elsewhere, leading to opposing effects on enrichment timescales between the inner and outer Galaxy. This prediction is at odds with recent observational constraints, which indicate remarkably minimal decline in metallicity ($\\lesssim$$0.1$ dex) between young ($\\sim$$0-2$ Gyr) and old populations ($\\sim$$8-10$ Gyr) across the \\textit{entire} Galactic disk. Radial gas flows cannot be the sole explanation of this result at all Galactocentric radii. Our models reproduce this result at $R\\gtrsim6$ kpc if the flow velocity is relatively constant in both radius and time near $v_{r,g}\\approx-1$ km/s. In agreement with previous GCE models, all of our flow prescriptions lead to lower metallicities and steeper radial gradients relative to static models. Exploiting this universal outcome, we identify mixing effects and the relative rates of star formation and metal-poor accretion as the processes that establish the ISM metallicity at low redshift. We provide a suite of analytic formulae describing radial metallicity gradient evolution based on this connection.",

Reines, Alberto Sesana, Jong-Hak Woo, Jianfeng Wu 27 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables, accepted for publication in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The black-hole occupation fraction ($f_\\mathrm{occ}$) defines the fraction of galaxies that harbor central massive black holes (MBHs), irrespective of their accretion activity level. While it is widely accepted that $f_\\mathrm{occ}$ is nearly 100% in local massive galaxies with stellar masses $M_\\star \\gtrsim 10^{10}~M_\\odot$, it is not yet clear whether MBHs are ubiquitous in less-massive galaxies. In this work, we present new constraints on $f_\\mathrm{occ}$ based on over 20 years of Chandra imaging data for 1606 galaxies within 50 Mpc. We employ a Bayesian model to simultaneously constrain $f_\\mathrm{occ}$ and the specific accretion-rate distribution function, $p(\\lambda)$, where the specific accretion rate is defined as $\\lambda=L_\\mathrm{X}/M_\\star$, and $L_\\mathrm{X}$ is the MBH accretion luminosity in the 2-10 keV range. Notably, we find that $p(\\lambda)$ peaks around $10^{28}~\\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}~M_\\odot^{-1}$; above this value, $p(\\lambda)$ decreases with increasing $\\lambda$, following a power-law that smoothly connects with the probability distribution of bona-fide active galactic nuclei. We also find that the occupation fraction decreases dramatically with decreasing $M_\\star$: in high mass galaxies ($M_\\star \\approx 10^{11-12}M_\\odot$), the occupation fraction is $>93\\%$ (a $2\\sigma$ lower limit), and then declines to $66_{-7}^{+8}\\%$ ($1\\sigma$ errors) between $M_\\star\\approx10^{9-10}M_\\odot$, and to $33_{-9}^{+13}\\%$ in the dwarf galaxy regime between $M_\\star\\approx10^{8-9}~M_\\odot$. Our results have significant implications for the normalization of the MBH mass function over the mass range most relevant for tidal disruption events, extreme mass ratio inspirals, and MBH merger rates that upcoming facilities are poised to explore.",

Gutcke, Giulia Despali, Stephanie O'Neil, Mark Vogelsberger, Azadeh Fattahi, David B.

Both simulations are run with the high-resolution, hydrodynamical LYRA galaxy formation model, allowing us to explore the global and substructure properties of the dwarf in a consistent context. While the overall halo growth, final mass, and subhalo mass functions remain largely unchanged across models, SIDM produces a central dark matter core extending to $\\sim$1 kpc, which does not significantly vary with the inclusion of baryons. Baryonic properties, however, differ notably. The SIDM model leads to a 25% reduction in stellar mass and retains more gas within the stellar half-mass radius due to a prolonged quiescent phase in star formation. The stellar distribution is less centrally concentrated, and a population of in-situ star clusters form at late times. Substructure analysis reveals fewer luminous satellites and more stellar-only systems in SIDM, driven in part by tidal stripping that affects the dark matter more than the stars. A subset of satellites undergoes tidal-triggered core collapse after infall, enhancing the diversity of SIDM satellite rotation curves. These differences offer potential observational signatures of SIDM in low-mass galaxies.",

Line emission (170-912A) from highly ionized metals (Fe, Ne, Mg) in million-degree LHB plasma may be responsible for the elevated ionization fractions of helium ($n_{\\rm HeII}/n_{\\rm He} \\approx 0.4$) compared to hydrogen ($n_{\\rm HII} / n_{\\rm H} \\approx 0.2$) in the local clouds. We update the stellar parameters and ionizing flux for $\\beta$ CMa, after correcting the EUV spectra for intervening HI column density, $N_{\\rm HI} = 1.9\\pm0.1\\times10^{18}~{\\rm cm}^{-2}$, and its hotter effective temperature, $T_{\\rm eff} \\approx 25,000$K vs. 21,000K for $\\epsilon$ CMa. These two stars produce a combined H-ionizing photon flux $\\Phi_{\\rm H} \\approx 6800\\pm1400$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at the external surface of the local clouds. The hot bubble could produce comparable fluxes, $\\Phi_{\\rm H} =$ 2000-9000 cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, depending on the amount of metal depletion into dust grains that survive sputtering. The radial velocities and proper motions of $\\beta$ CMa and $\\epsilon$ CMa indicate that both stars passed within $10\\pm1$ pc of the Sun $4.4\\pm0.1$ Myr ago, with 100-200 times higher local ionizing fluxes. At that time, the local clouds were likely farther from the Sun, owing to their transverse motion. Over the last few Myr, EUV radiation from these two stars left a wake of highly ionized gas in a hot, low-density cavity produced by past supernova explosions in the Sco-Cen OB association and connected with the LHB.",

      "abstract": "Galaxy sizes and compactness at Cosmic Dawn P. Cataldi, S. Pedrosa, L. J. Pellizza, D. Ceverino, L. A. Bignone Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The James Webb Space Telescope has found an unexpected population of high-mass galaxies ($\\log (M^\\star / {\\rm M} _\\odot) \\gtrsim 10$) with extremely small effective radii ($\\sim 100\\,\\rm pc$) at $z \\gtrsim 6$. Also, the existence of an unusual size--mass relation has been claimed. These observations are only partially reproduced by current models, and the physics responsible for the observed relations is still under debate. We expect to unveil the formation channels of the observed compact galaxies. We analyse 7605 snapshots for 169 galaxies of the state-of-the-art cosmological simulation suite FirstLight. We find that galaxies undergo an expansion--compaction--re-expansion process. This process operates in a specific mass range; compaction starts at $\\log (M^\\star_ {\\rm on} / {\\rm M}_\\odot) \\sim 8.5$ and ends at $\\log (M^\\star_{\\rm off} / \\mathrm{M}_\\odot) \\sim 9.5$. In between these masses, the size--mass relation becomes inverted, with a negative slope. The physical mechanism driving this process in our simulations involves a self-reinforced inflow of gas from the outer regions, that triggers a strong, localised starburst at the centre (within $1\\, {\\rm kpc}$). This contraction continues until conditions favour star formation in a broader area, and the normal inside-out growth pattern resumes. We present evidence for the existence of a universal wet compaction operating at Cosmic Dawn. This mechanism is driven by spherical accretion triggered by the change of the state of the central matter of galaxies, from dark matter- to baryon-dominated. We also propose an analytical expression for the infall process, suitable for use in semi-analytic models. Contrary to low-redshift galaxies, in high-redshift systems compaction ends without gas depletion and star-formation quenching.",

Beasley Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The properties of massive and compact early-type galaxies provide important constraints on early galaxy formation. Among these, massive relic galaxies, characterized by old stellar populations and minimal late-time accretion, are considered preserved compact galaxies from the high-$z$ Universe. We investigate compact and massive galaxies (CMGs) using the TNG50 cosmological simulation, applying uniform selection criteria matching observational surveys at $z=0$, $z=0.3$, and $z=0.7$, enabling direct comparisons with observed compact galaxies. CMGs are classified according to their stellar mass assembly histories to examine how compactness relates to dynamical properties and chemical enrichment across cosmic time. Our results show that simulated CMGs follow the observed mass-size relation, with the number of objects increasing at higher redshifts, in line with observational trends. Dynamically, while observations suggest relic galaxies are outliers in the stellar mass-velocity dispersion plane, simulated compacts show relatively uniform velocity dispersions across different accretion histories. Observed relics are more metal-rich than other compact galaxies with extended star formation, deviating from the local mass-metallicity relation. In contrast, simulated CMGs are overall more metal-rich than the quiescent population, regardless of accretion history. The deviation from the mass-metallicity relation decreases with redshift. These results suggest that the extreme characteristics of CMGs in TNG50, particularly in metallicity and dynamics, are less pronounced than in observed relics. Nonetheless, these results offer a theoretical framework to assess the properties of such extreme objects from different epochs, highlighting both alignment with and deviations between the models.",

Using direct-method oxygen abundances, we find a complex metallicity profile that generally declines with distance, decreasing by 0.37 dex from the galaxy center out to 2.4 kpc into the outflow. This implies a metal-loading factor roughly an order of magnitude lower than predictions based on the mass-metallicity relation for low-mass galaxies. We also detect extended HeII emission, including a broad, redshifted component beyond 2 kpc, distinct from narrow emission associated with star clusters. No H$\\beta$ emission is detected associated with the broad redshifted component, implying extremely high HeII/H$\\beta$ ratios (0.7--4.8). Such extreme values, combined with the decreasing metallicity, challenge current models for stellar feedback. The contribution of an intermediate-mass black hole could simultaneously account for the declining metallicity and the unusually extended HeII emission.",

We analyze the correlation of star-formation rate vs. stellar mass (the star-forming main sequence, SFMS) for our sample and find no significant difference between the intrinsic scatter in the H$\\alpha$-based SFMS and the UV-continuum-based SFMS. However, the diagnostic power of the SFMS is limited at high redshift and low stellar mass due to observational biases that exclude faint, quenched galaxies. To more directly probe star-formation variability, we examine the dust-corrected H$\\alpha$-to-UV ratio, which is assumed to trace deviations a from constant SFH over the past $\\sim100$ Myr. In our sample, $73^{+4}_{-4}$% of galaxies exhibit H$\\alpha$-to-UV ratios inconsistent with a constant SFH. We do not observe any statistically significant evolution in the H$\\alpha$-to-UV ratio with redshift. Additionally, lower-mass galaxies ($7\\leq\\text{log}(M_*/M_{\\odot})<8.5$) are $30 \\pm 1$% more likely to lie above this equilibrium range -- indicative of a recent ($\\lesssim 100$ Myr) burst of star formation -- compared to higher-mass systems ($8.5\\leq\\text{log}(M_*/M_{\\odot})\\leq10.9$).

The IRAM measurements from 2006 to 2024 show that the total flux of 3C 286 is stable within measurement uncertainties, indicating long-term stability up to 229 GHz, when applying a fixed Kelvin-to-Jansky conversion factor throughout its dataset. ALMA data from 2018 to 2024 exhibit a decrease in flux, which up to 4% could be attributed to an apparent increase in the absolute brightness of Uranus, the primary flux calibrator for ALMA with the ESA4 model. Taken together, these results suggest that the intrinsic total flux of 3C 286 has remained stable up to 229 GHz over the monitoring period. The polarization properties of 3C 286 are stable across all observing frequencies. The electric vector position angle (EVPA) gradually rotates as a function of wavelength squared, which is well described by a single power-law over the full frequency range. We therefore propose using the theoretical EVPA values from this model curve for absolute EVPA calibration between 5 and 343.4 GHz. The Faraday rotation measure increases as a function of frequency up to (3.2+/-1.5)x10^4 rad m^-2, following RM proportional to nu^alpha with alpha = 2.05+/-0.06. This trend is consistent with the core-shift effect expected in a conical jet.",

Accepted by ApJL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) GW231123 is a binary black hole merger whose primary component lies within or above the pair-instability mass gap, while the secondary component falls within this gap. The standard theory of stellar evolution is significantly challenged by this event. We investigate the formation of candidate progenitors of GW231123 in Population III (Pop3) star clusters. We find that they could form through stellar mergers, binary black hole mergers, and mixed mergers. The mass distribution of these candidate progenitors covers the component masses of GW231123. Their predicted merger rate density spans the range of $0.001{\\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}-0.26{\\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$, encompassing that of GW231123. These findings suggest that GW231123 may originate from Pop3 star clusters. Furthermore, such candidate progenitors are expected to be detectable by future gravitational wave detectors LISA/Taiji/TianQin/DECIGO/CE/ET, which would provide valuable insights into the formation scenarios of events like GW231123.",

Additionally, our findings revealed robust correlations between SFRs and specific SFRs (sSFRs) with Eddington ratios. Eddington ratio exhibited gradual transitions in the (s)SFRs-stellar mass diagrams. Galaxies with high Eddington ratios displayed high star formation activity, similar to blue SF galaxies. Furthermore, we observed decreasing sSFR trends from SF galaxies to composite, Seyfert, and LINER galaxies.

      "abstract": "The effect of extended radio emission on SMBH accretion rate estimates Stergios Amarantidis, Duncan Farrah, Nick Seymour, Mark Lacy, Iris Breda, Bodo Ziegler, Olmo Piana, Miguel Sánchez-Portal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Accretion rates in radio galaxies are typically estimated from optical and total radio flux measurements, incorporating emission from the core, jets, and lobes. These estimates can be used to investigate the link between observed Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) emission properties and the underlying accretion physics of their Super-Massive Black Holes (SMBHs). However, while optical and core radio emission trace the ongoing accretion episode, extended jet and lobe structures may result from past AGN activity. Therefore, accretion rates inferred from spatially unresolved radio observations may be systematically overestimated, a bias whose prevalence and extent have yet to be thoroughly explored. In this study, using a sample of 121 local radio-loud galaxies with spatially resolved radio components, we assess this effect by estimating their \\textit{Eddington}-scaled accretion rates ($\\lambda$) using both the common methodology which considers total radio fluxes and a simple but novel approach that treats core and extended emission as signatures of distinct accretion phases. Our results show that the former method systematically overestimates the $\\lambda$ by a factor of $\\sim 3$, affecting the accretion mode classification in approximately $11\\%$ of sources. This discrepancy appears to correlate with radio size, with the most extended galaxies indicating a transition in accretion disk mode. Such a bias could affect AGN classification in unresolved high-redshift radio surveys. Our results motivate re-examining accretion rate calculations from AGN radio surveys and align with the AGN unification model for radio galaxies, revealing a clearer link between accretion disk physics and optical spectral properties.",

Guzman, Alyssa Goodman, Takayoshi Kusune, Miaomiao Zhang, Nicole Karnath, Jessy Marin Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Stars primarily form in galactic spiral arms within dense, filamentary molecular clouds. The largest and most elongated of these molecular clouds are referred to as ``bones,\" which are massive, velocity-coherent filaments (lengths ~20 to >100 pc, widths ~1-2 pc) that run approximately parallel and in close proximity to the Galactic plane. While these bones have been generally well characterized, the importance and structure of their magnetic fields (B-fields) remain largely unconstrained. Through the SOFIA Legacy program FIELDMAPS, we mapped the B-fields of 10 bones in the Milky Way. We found that their B-fields are varied, with no single preferred alignment along the entire spine of the bones. At higher column densities, the spines of the bones are more likely to align perpendicularly to the B-fields, although this is not ubiquitous, and the alignment shows no strong correlation with the locations of identified young stellar objects. We estimated the B-field strengths across the bones and found them to be ~30-150 $\\mu$G at pc scales. Despite the generally low virial parameters, the B-fields are strong compared to the local gravity, suggesting that B-fields play a significant role in resisting global collapse. Moreover, the B-fields may slow and guide gas flow during dissipation. Recent star formation within the bones may be due to high-density pockets at smaller scales, which could have formed before or simultaneously with the bones.",

Submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Infrared emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) play a major role in determining the charge balance of their host environments that include photo-dissociation regions (PDRs) in galaxies, planetary nebulae, and rims of molecular clouds. We aim to investigate the distribution and sizes of charged PAHs across the key zones of the Orion Bar PDR. We employ JWST MIRI-MRS observations of the Orion Bar from the Early Release Science program ''PDRs4All'' and synthetic images in the JWST MIRI filters. We investigate the spatial morphology of the AIBs at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.0 $\\mu$m that commonly trace PAH cations, and the neutral PAH-tracing 11.2 $\\mu$m AIB, their (relative) correlations, and the relationship with existing empirical prescriptions for AIBs. The 6.2. 7.7, 8.6, 11.0, and 11.2 $\\mu$m AIBs are similar in spatial morphology, on larger scales. Analyzing three-feature intensity correlations, two distinct groups emerge: the 8.6 and 11.0 $\\mu$m vs. the 6.2 and 7.7 $\\mu$m AIBs. We attribute these correlations to PAH size. The 6.2 and 7.7 $\\mu$m AIBs trace cationic, medium-sized PAHs. Quantum chemical calculations reveal that the 8.6 $\\mu$m AIB is carried by large, compact, cationic PAHs, and the 11.0 $\\mu$m AIB's correlation to it implies, so is this band. The 6.2/8.6 and 7.7/8.6 PAH band ratios thus probe PAH size. We conclude that the 6.2/11.2 AIB ratio is the most reliable proxy for charged PAHs, within the cohort. We outline JWST MIRI imaging prescriptions that serve as effective tracers of the PAH ionization fraction as traced. This study showcases the efficacy of the 6-9 $\\mu$m AIBs to probe the charge state and size distribution of the emitting PAHs, offering insights into the physical conditions of their host environments. JWST MIRI photometry offers a viable alternative to IFU spectroscopy for characterizing this emission in extended objects.",

The software is publicly available at this https URL Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The increasing use of ML in astronomy introduces important questions about interpretability. Due to their complexity and non-linear nature, it can be challenging to understand their decision-making process. While these models can effectively identify unusual spectra, interpreting the physical nature of the flagged outliers remains a major challenge. We aim to bridge the gap between anomaly detection and physical understanding by combining deep learning with interpretable ML (iML) techniques to identify and explain anomalous galaxy spectra from SDSS data. We present a flexible framework that uses a variational autoencoder to compute multiple anomaly scores, including physically-motivated variants of the mean squared error. We adapt the iML LIME algorithm to spectroscopic data, systematically explore segmentation and perturbation strategies, and compute explanation weights that identify the features most responsible for each detection. To uncover population-level trends, we normalize the LIME weights and apply clustering to the top 1\\% most anomalous spectra. Our approach successfully separates instrumental artifacts from physically meaningful outliers and groups anomalous spectra into astrophysically coherent categories. These include dusty, metal-rich starbursts; chemically-enriched H\\,II regions with moderate excitation; and extreme emission-line galaxies with low metallicity and hard ionizing spectra. The explanation weights align with established emission-line diagnostics, enabling a physically-grounded taxonomy of spectroscopic anomalies. Our work shows that interpretable anomaly detection provides a scalable, transparent, and physically meaningful approach to exploring large spectroscopic datasets. Our framework opens the door for incorporating interpretability tools into quality control, follow-up targeting, and discovery pipelines in current and future surveys.",

By applying Bayesian inference to the analysis of abundance patterns of these ancient stars, this study presents a systematic investigation into the properties and explosion mechanism of Pop III stars. We apply NLTE corrections to enhance the reliability of abundance measurements, which significantly reduces the discrepancies in abundances between observations and theoretical yields for odd-Z elements, such as Na and Al. Our Bayesian framework also enables the incorporation of explodability and effectively mitigates biases introduced by varying resolutions across different supernova model grids. In addition to confirming a top-heavy ($\\alpha=0.54$) initial mass function for massive Pop III stars, we derive a robust mass--energy relation ($E\\propto M^2$) of the first supernovae. These findings demonstrate that stellar abundance analysis provides a powerful and independent approach for probing early supernova physics and the fundamental nature of the first stars.",

Towards characterising the history of the Hubble sequence, we perform a morphological analysis of 2445 and 12,786 galaxies with $I_E < 21$ and $I_E < 23$, respectively. We use single-Sérsic profiles and the sums of a Sérsic bulge and an exponential disc to model these galaxies with SourceXtractor++ and analyse their parameters in order to assess their consistencies and discrepancies. The fitted galaxies to $I_E < 21$ span the various Hubble types with ubiquitous bulge and disc components, and a bulge-to-total light ratio B/T taking all values from 0 to 1. The effective radius of the single-Sérsic profile is an intermediate estimate of galaxy size, between the bulge and disc effective radii, depending on B/T. The axis ratio of the single-Sérsic profile is higher than the disc axis ratio, increasingly so with B/T. The model impacts the photometry with -0.08 to 0.01 mag median systematic $I_E$ offsets between single-Sérsic and bulge+disc total magnitudes, and a 0.05 to 0.15 mag dispersion, from low to high B/T. We measure a median 0.3 mag bulge-disk colour difference in rest-frame $M_g - M_i$ that originates from the disc-dominated galaxies, whereas bulge-dominated galaxies have similar median colours of their components. Remarkably, we also measure redder-inside disc colour gradients, based on 5 to 10% systematic variations of disc effective radii between the optical and near-IR bands. This analysis demonstrates the usefulness and limitations of single-Sérsic profile modelling, and the power of bulge-disc decomposition for reliably characterising the morphology of lenticulars and spirals in Euclid images.",

Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We use intergalactic medium (IGM) metallicity distributions from several state-of-the-art cosmological simulations of Milky Way analogs and a semi-analytic model of ultra-faint dwarf galaxy (UFD) formation to model the stellar metallicities of UFDs in MW-like environments. We study simulations with different treatments of star formation, stellar feedback, and Population III enrichment, and in all cases, we find that only a few percent of the IGM accretable by UFD progenitors is enriched to metallicities $\\rm [Fe/H]\\ge-4$. When the metallicity of accreted IGM in the semi-analytic galaxy formation model is set using these IGM metallicity distributions, the model underpredicts UFD metallicities and their scatter compared to the observed luminosity--metallicity relation. Our results indicate that IGM enrichment is not the dominant mechanism setting metallicities of UFD stars. Instead, UFD stellar metallicity is determined primarily by the interplay between internal enrichment and metal loss through feedback-driven outflows. We examine models with different values of the maximum outflow mass loading factor $\\eta_{\\rm max}$ and show that the full range of average stellar metallicities of UFDs at $M_V<-7$ can be reproduced if the maximum mass loading factor varies in the range $200\\lesssim\\eta_{\\rm max}\\lesssim 2000$. We also consider stellar metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) within individual model galaxies with different assumptions about IGM enrichment and $\\eta_{\\rm max}$. We find that all considered models are in reasonable agreement with observed UFD MDFs, with model differences less than the uncertainties of current metallicity measurements.",

Leitinger, Holger Baumgardt, Alexey Bobrick, Ivan Cabrera-Ziri, Michael Hilker, Andrew J. Winter 12 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The majority of Galactic globular star clusters (GCs) have been reported to contain at least two populations of stars (we use P1 for the primordial and P2 for the chemically-enriched population). Recent observational studies found that dynamically-old GCs have P1 and P2 spatially mixed due to relaxation processes. However, in dynamically-young GCs, where P2 is expected to be more centrally concentrated from birth, the spatial distributions of P1 and P2 are sometimes very different from system to system. This suggests that more complex dynamical processes specific to certain GCs might have shaped those distributions. We aim to investigate the discrepancies between the spatial concentration of P1 and P2 stars in dynamically-young GCs. Our focus is to evaluate whether massive binary stars (e.g. BHs) can cause the expansion of the P2 stars through binary-single interactions in the core, and whether they can mix or even radially invert the P1 and P2 distributions. We use a set of theoretical and empirical arguments to evaluate the effectiveness of binary-single star scattering. We then construct a set of direct N-body models with massive primordial binaries to verify our estimates further and gain more insights into the dynamical processes in GCs. We find that binary-single star scatterings can push the central P2 stars outwards within a few relaxation times. While we do not produce radial inversion of P1 and P2 for any initial conditions we tested, this mechanism systematically produces clusters where P1 and P2 look fully mixed even in projection. The mixing is enhanced 1) in denser GCs, 2) in GCs containing more binary stars, and 3) when the mass ratio between the binary components and the cluster members is higher. Binary-single star interactions seem able to explain the observable properties of some dynamically-young GCs (e.g. NGC4590 or NGC5904) where P1 and P2 are fully radially mixed.",

Catalogue will be available at CDS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Context: This research presents unsupervised machine learning and statistical methods to identify and analyze tidal tails in open star clusters using data from the Gaia-DR3 catalog. Aims: We aim to identify member stars, detect and analyze tidal tails in five open clusters, BH 164, Alessi 2, NGC 2281, NGC 2354, and M67, of ages between 60 Myr and 4 Gyr. These clusters were selected based on the previous evidence of extended tidal structures. Methods: We utilized machine learning algorithms such as Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), along with statistical methods to analyze the kinematic, photometric, and astrometric properties of stars. Key characteristics of tidal tails, including radial velocity, color-magnitude diagram, and spatial projections in the tangent plane beyond the cluster's Jacobi radius ($r_J$), were used to detect them. We used N-body simulations to visualize and compare the observables with real data. Further analysis was done on the detected cluster and tail stars to study their internal dynamics and populations, including binary fraction. We also applied the residual velocity method to detect rotational patterns in the clusters and their tails. Results: We identified tidal tails in all five clusters, with detected tails extending farther in some clusters and containing significantly more stars than previously reported (tails ranging from 40 to 100 pc, one to four times the Jacobi radius, with 100 - 200 tail stars). The luminosity functions of the tails and their parent clusters were generally consistent, and tails lacked massive stars. In general, the binary fraction was found to be higher in the tidal tails. Significant rotation was detected in M67 and NGC 2281 for the first time.",

We analyze HMI and EUV images and found that this event involved two filament eruptions ~8 hours apart from two different active region closed to each other. We produce 3D magnetic field configurations for the active regions that are consistent with the observations and employ numerical models to track the CME/ICME propagation up to 1\\,au. From our, magnetic models we found that the nearby coronal hole reduced the stability threshold of the flux ropes, with axial flux values approximately three times lower than in comparable cases without coronal holes. A derivative analysis applied to STEREO coronagraph and OMNI database in situ data revealed no evidence of CME-CME interaction during the early stages of their evolution and identified distinct signatures of two CMEs, along with the interacting flow associated with the nearby coronal hole at 1 au. Moreover, we used hydrodynamic simulations constrained by remote sensing and in situ data to track the different structures in the solar wind. We found a good agreement between data and the models. Additionally, we found that the presence of the coronal hole may have suppressed interactions between CMEs, with the transients subsequently propagating along the solar wind streams emerging from the coronal hole.",

Tiwari, David Berghmans, Andrei Zhukov, Marilena Mierla, Cis Verbeeck, Koen Stegen 18 pages, 11 figures, Accepted for publication in ApJ September 2025 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present detailed analysis of an active region coronal jet accompanying a minifilament eruption that is fully captured and well-resolved in high spatial resolution 174A coronal images from Solar Orbiters Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI). The active region jet is simultaneously observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). An erupting minifilament is rooted at the edge of an active region where mixed-polarity magnetic flux is present. Minority-polarity positive flux merges and cancels with the active regions dominant negative flux at an average rate of 1019 Mx/hr, building a minifilament-holding flux rope and triggering its eruption. The eruption shows a slow rise followed by a fast rise, akin to large-scale filament eruptions. EUI images and Mg II k spectra, displaying simultaneously blueshifts and redshifts at the opposite edges of the spire, indicate counterclockwise untwisting of the jet spire. This jet is the clearest, most comprehensively observed active-region jet with this instrument set, displaying striking similarities with quiet Sun and coronal hole jets. Its magnetic, thermal, and kinetic energies suggest a significant contribution to local coronal heating. We conclude that magnetic flux cancelation builds a minifilament-carrying twisted flux rope and also eventually triggers the flux ropes eruption that makes the coronal jet, in line with our recent results on the buildup and explosion of solar coronal jets in quiet Sun and coronal holes. That is, this active region jet clearly works the same way as the vast majority of quiet Sun and coronal hole jets.",

The only free parameter in the PFSS method is the source-surface height ($R_{\\rm SS}$), beyond which all field lines are open. Although $R_{\\rm SS}$ is known to vary with solar activity, there is no consensus on how to determine it for a given surface magnetic field distribution. In this study, we investigate the nature of $R_{\\rm SS}$ using a long-period (2006-2023) data, covering two solar minima and one maximum. We adopt ADAPT-GONG magnetograms and determine $R_{\\rm SS}$ by matching the open flux estimated from observations at 1 au with that calculated using the PFSS method. Our analysis reveals that $R_{\\rm SS}$ increases slightly after the solar minima and around the solar maximum, and that it can be characterized by both the mean unsigned photospheric magnetic field strength and the dipolarity parameter $f_{\\rm dip}$, defined as $f_{\\rm dip} = B_{\\rm dip}^2/(B_{\\rm dip}^2 + B_{\\rm quad}^2 + B_{\\rm oct}^2)$, with $B_{\\rm dip}$, $B_{\\rm quad}$, and $B_{\\rm oct}$ denoting the magnitudes of dipolar, quadrupolar, and octupolar components of photospheric radial magnetic field, respectively. Our results suggest that $R_{\\rm SS}$ does not exhibit a simple monotonic dependence on the solar activity and must be determined by properly considering both surface magnetic field strength and global field structure.",

Hayes, Emil Kraaikamp, Aadish Joshi, Konstantina Loumou, Cis Verbeeck, David Berghmans, Krzysztof Barczynski 17 pages, 16 figures, accepted for publication in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Small scale extreme ultraviolet (EUV) transient brightenings are observationally abundant and critically important to investigate. Determining whether they share the same physical mechanisms as larger scale flares would have significant implications for the coronal heating problem. A recent study has revealed that quasi periodic pulsations (QPPs), a common feature in both solar and stellar flares, may also be present in EUV brightenings in the quiet Sun (QS). We aim to characterise the properties of EUV brightenings and their associated QPPs in both QS and active regions (ARs) using unprecedented 1 s cadence observations from Solar Orbiter/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI). We applied an automated detection algorithm to analyse statistical properties of EUV brightenings. QPPs were identified using complementary techniques optimised for both stationary and non stationary signals, including a Fourier based method, ensemble empirical mode decomposition, and wavelet analysis. Over 500000 and 300000 brightenings were detected in ARs and QS regions, respectively. Brightenings with lifetimes shorter than 3 s were detected, demonstrating the importance of high temporal resolution. QPP periods span from 5 to over 500 s and show similar distributions between AR and QS. We found a consistent power law scaling, with a weak correlation and a large spread, between QPP period and lifetime in EUV brightenings, solar, and stellar flares. The results support the interpretation that EUV brightenings may represent a small scale manifestation of the same physical mechanisms driving larger solar and stellar flares. Furthermore, the similarity in the statistical properties of EUV brightenings and their associated QPPs between AR and QS regions suggests that the underlying generation mechanisms may not strongly depend on the large scale magnetic environment.",

Priolet 25 pages, 21 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The mid-infrared (MIR) emitting regions of the individual protoplanetary disks in the binary system Z CMa are resolved by MATISSE/VLTI. The observations were obtained during a serendipitous large outburst of the HBe star that lasted more than 100 days, while the FUor companion is presumed to be in quiescence. The size of the MIR-emitting disk region of the more massive HBe star increases toward longer wavelengths from $<14$ mas at 3.5$\\mu m$ to $\\ll 50$ mas at 11.5$\\mu m$ . The lack of substructures in the HBe disk might suggest that it is a continuous disk; however, this could be due to observational constraints. We also note a radial variation of the silicate absorption feature over the disk, where the optical depth increases inwards of $<$40~au radii. This contradicts the scenario of a carved, dusty cocoon surrounding the HBe star. In the case of the less massive FUor companion, the MIR-emitting region is much smaller with an angular size $\\leq$15 mas (or else a physical radius $<9$ au) in all bands, suggesting a compact disk. Both disks are aligned within uncertainties, and their orientation agrees with that of the known jets. Furthermore, MATISSE data place the binary's separation at $117.88 \\pm 0.73$ mas and a position angle of $139.16^o\\,\\pm\\,0.29^o$ east of north. Our estimates for the orbital elements gave an eccentric orbit ($e\\sim0.17$) with a moderate inclination ($i\\sim 66$\\degr). The derived total mass is $M_{\\rm total} = 16.4^{+2.1}_{-2.3}$ M$_\\odot$, while the period is approximately 950 years. Our MATISSE imaging of the Herbig disk during outburst indicates a temperature gradient for the disk, while imaging of the FUor companion's disk corroborates previous studies showing that FUor disks are rather compact in the MIR. We cannot infer any misalignment between the MATISSE results and earlier ALMA/JVLA data, nor can we infer any influence from the alleged flyby event.",

This so-called BD desert may result from the transition between two different dominant formation processes occurring for different mass regimes. While the BD mass derived from radial-velocity measurements helps confirm the nature of the analyzed objects, the BD radius obtained from transits is important to better constrain the BD age, as BDs are believed to contract with age. Such objects with well-constrained parameters, although in small number, are of prime interest for deeper investigations of BD structure and chemical composition. The present document aims at presenting the first results of a search for BD transits among a sample of approximately 3300 host star candidates observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite during Cycle 6.",

Processes Geophys., 32, 309-327, 2025 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) In this paper we use statistical complexity and information theory metrics to study structure within solar wind time series. We explore this using entropy-complexity and information planes, where the measure for entropy is formed using either permutation entropy or the degree distribution of a horizontal visibility graph (HVG). The entropy is then compared to the Jensen complexity (Jensen-Shannon complexity plane) and Fisher information measure (Fisher-Shannon information plane), formed both from permutations and the HVG approach. Additionally we characterise the solar wind time series by studying the properties of the HVG degree distribution. Four types of solar wind intervals have been analysed, namely fast streams, slow streams, magnetic clouds and sheath regions, all of which have distinct origins and interplanetary characteristics. Our results show that, overall, different metrics give similar results but Fisher-Shannon, which gives a more local measure of complexity, leads to a larger spread of values in the entropy-complexity plane. Magnetic cloud intervals stood out in all approaches, in particular when analysing the magnetic field magnitude. Differences between solar wind types (except for magnetic clouds) were typically more distinct for larger time lags, suggesting universality in fluctuations for small scales. The fluctuations within the solar wind time series were generally found to be stochastic, in agreement with previous studies. The use of information theory tools in the analysis of solar wind time series can help to identify structures and provide insight into their origin and formation.",

Final version to appear in Solar Physics Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We report on the characterization of a coronal mass ejection (CME) observed on 22 October 2003 by the LASCO-C2 and C3 coronagraphs over a time interval of 6 hours. This CME clearly appears as an asymmetric flux-rope in self-similar expansion and in spite of having a single vantage point, this relatively simple morphology and the geometry of the observations allow us to reconstruct its shape and its trajectory. The images are first processed in order to remove most of the background or foreground coronal structures (essentially streamers) which are superimposed on the CME. The analysis is based on forward modeling of an asymmetric structure where the plasma is homogeneously distributed in a thin shell and synthetic images are calculated from Thomson scattering by the electrons. They are best fitted to the images to determine the exact shape of the flux rope, and to track its evolution characterized by a radial propagation in self-similar expansion. The analysis supports the forward propagation (over the backward one) characterized by constant accelerations of 76 and 46 m/sec^2 for the front and rear parts of the CME, respectively. The respective velocities at 20 Rsun reach 2000 and 1100 km/s, and its mass unbiased by projection effects is estimated at 1.7x10^16 g. Altogether, these are quite exceptionally large values among CMEs and imply a very energetic event. No erupting event could be identified at or near the calculated initial location of the CME. It lies 25° west of the active region NOAA 10484, the site of contemporary, violent, and recurrent solar eruptions (the ``Halloween event'') and a putative connection would require a strong deflection over a very short path. Therefore, the origin of this CME remains unclear.",

Heating occurs intermittently at discrete locations on the chromospheric surface, modeled through a surface coarse-graining procedure that produces non-thermal boundary conditions for the Vlasov equation. The resulting stationary distribution functions generate suprathermal particle populations and naturally lead to a temperature inversion via gravitational filtering, without any local coronal heating. The model reproduces realistic temperature and density profiles with a thin transition region and a hot corona, consistent with solar observations. These results demonstrate that the spatial intermittency of heating at the chromospheric interface is sufficient to account for the formation of the transition region and the high-temperature corona.",

However, their tracking is typically limited to about half a solar rotation when relying on single-vantage-point observations. Combining observations from both the Earth-facing and far side of the Sun, we monitored the magnetic and coronal evolution and characterised the non-potentiality of one of the most complex and eruptive regions of the past two decades, over more than three full solar rotations. We used photospheric magnetograms and EUV filtergrams from the Solar Orbiter and the Solar Dynamics Observatory along with flare detections from the GOES and the STIX instrument on board the Solar Orbiter. All images were deprojected into a common coordinate system and merged into a unified dataset. We tracked the evolution of magnetic flux and EUV emission and computed magnetic field parameters from the line-of-sight magnetograms to quantify the region's non-potentiality. We identified the region's initial emergence and followed its evolution through to its decay. The region developed through successive flux emergence episodes over a period of 20 days, reached its peak complexity one month after the first emergence, and gradually decayed over the subsequent two months. Unlike many complex regions, it consistently maintained high levels of non-potentiality for most of its lifetime, sustaining equally strong flaring activity. The derived time series of non-potentiality parameters, the first of their kind, far exceeded the typical 14-day window imposed by solar rotation and were remarkably consistent, exhibiting strong correlation with the flaring activity of the region. Multi-vantage-point observations can significantly improve our understanding of how magnetic flux emerges, evolves, and drives solar activity, beyond the two-week limit imposed by solar rotation on observations along the Sun-Earth line.",

      "abstract": "Dormant BH candidates from Gaia DR3 summary diagnostics Johanna Müller-Horn, Hans-Walter Rix, Kareem El-Badry, Ben Pennell, Matthew Green, Jiadong Li, Rhys Seeburger 17 pages, 15 figures, submitted to A&A, comments welcome, catalogues are available here: this https URL Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present a rigorous identification of candidates for dormant black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs) in binaries using summary statistics from Gaia DR3, rather than full orbital solutions. Although Gaia astrometric orbits have already revealed a small sample of compact object binaries, many systems remain undetected due to stringent quality cuts imposed on the published orbits. Using a forward-modelling framework that simulates Gaia observables, in particular the renormalised unit weight error (ruwe) and radial velocity (RV) scatter, we infer posterior distributions for companion mass and orbital period via MCMC sampling, marginalising over nuisance orbital parameters. We validate our approach by comparing the predicted masses and periods against full orbit solutions from DR3, and by successfully recovering known compact object binaries as promising candidates. The method is best suited for systems with red giant primaries, which have more reliable Gaia RV scatter and a light centroid more likely dominated by one component, compared to main-sequence stars. And they are less likely to be triples with short-period inner binaries, which produce confounding signatures. We apply the method to three million giants and identify 556 systems with best-fit companion masses $\\gtrsim 3\\,M_\\odot$. Recovery simulations suggest our selection method is substantially more sensitive than the DR3 non-single-star catalogue, particularly for binaries with periods below 1 year and above $\\sim 6$ years. These candidates represent promising targets for spectroscopic follow-up and Gaia DR4 analysis to confirm the presence of compact objects. Candidate main-sequence stars with massive companions face a larger set of confounding effects. Therefore, we present an analogous catalogue of 279 additional `main sequence' candidates only as an appendix.",

Proceeding of the Annual meeting of the French Society of Astronomy and Astrophysics (Journées SF2A 2025) Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Gamma Dor stars are ideal targets for studies of the innermost dynamical properties of stars, due to their rich frequency spectrum of gravito-inertial modes propagating in the radiative envelope. Recent studies found that these modes could couple at the core-to-envelope interface with pure inertial modes in their sub-inertial regime, forming the so-called inertial dip in the period-spacing pattern of these stars. The inertial dip, as formed by core modes, stands out as a unique probe of core properties. We aim in this work to explore the effect of core magnetism on its structure, property of key relevance in modern stellar physics. We describe the outlines of our model and the geometry of the considered field. We give the coupling equation and the variation of the dip shape and location with increasing magnetic contrast between the core and the envelope. We compare our findings to the ones obtained in a hydrodynamical, differentially-rotating case. We show hints at potentially lifting the degeneracy between the signatures of core-to-envelope differential rotation and core magnetic fields. Together, these two cases can be considered as an exploration of different magnetic regimes potentially reached in the core of gamma Dor stars.",

The traditional evaluation criterion $\\xi_{2.5}$ $=$ 0.45, primarily established using non-rotating progenitor models, suffers from significant inaccuracies when applied to rotating pre-supernova systems. The effects of metallicity and rotation on the explodability landscapes of massive stars lack robust quantification. We aim to investigate how rotation and metallicity influence the explodability of massive stars. We investigate how rotation and metallicity affect stellar explodability using MESA simulations with initial rotational velocities of $0$, $300$, and $600~\\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$ at three metallicities ($Z_{\\odot}$, $1/10,Z_{\\odot}$, $1/50,Z_{\\odot}$). Core-collapse phases are simulated with GR1D to determine critical heating efficiencies. Our results yield revised $\\xi_{2.5}$ criteria: 0.45 for non-rotating models; 0.48 for $300~\\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$; 0.47 for $600~\\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$ at solar metallicity; and 0.59 for low-metallicity models. Chemically homogeneous evolution in rapidly rotating low-metallicity stars significantly raises the compactness limit for successful explosions and narrows the zero-age main sequence mass range for failed supernovae. Rotation substantially affects the explodability of low-metallicity massive stars, underscoring the importance of incorporating rotational effects in models of core-collapse supernova progenitors.",

Shah, Dennis Wu, Adam A. Miller, Han Liu Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are increasingly being adopted as highly-capable general-purpose time series representation learners. Although their training corpora are vast, they exclude astronomical time series data. Observations of stars produce peta-scale time series with unique challenges including irregular sampling and heteroskedasticity. We introduce StarEmbed, the first public benchmark for rigorous and standardized evaluation of state-of-the-art TSFMs on stellar time series observations (``light curves''). We benchmark on three scientifically-motivated downstream tasks: unsupervised clustering, supervised classification, and out-of-distribution source detection. StarEmbed integrates a catalog of expert-vetted labels with multi-variate light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility, yielding ~40k hand-labeled light curves spread across seven astrophysical classes. We evaluate the zero-shot representation capabilities of three TSFMs (MOIRAI, Chronos, Chronos-Bolt) and a domain-specific transformer (Astromer) against handcrafted feature extraction, the long-standing baseline in the astrophysics literature. Our results demonstrate that these TSFMs, especially the Chronos models, which are trained on data completely unlike the astronomical observations, can outperform established astrophysics-specific baselines in some tasks and effectively generalize to entirely new data. In particular, TSFMs deliver state-of-the-art performance on our out-of-distribution source detection benchmark. With the first benchmark of TSFMs on astronomical time series data, we test the limits of their generalization and motivate a paradigm shift in time-domain astronomy from using task-specific, fully supervised pipelines toward adopting generic foundation model representations for the analysis of peta-scale datasets from forthcoming observatories.",

In this paper we used 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics and radiative transfer simulations to study the kinematic perturbations induced in disks by infalling material. We found that deviations from Keplerian rotation are predominantly in the radial and vertical velocity components, spatially correlated with spiral arms in the gas surface density. The infall produces observable wiggles in the channel maps, analogous to those produce by the gravitational instability (GI), along with large-scale arcs and filaments. GI induced spiral arms produce radial velocity perturbations that point towards the center of the spiral arm owing to their higher self-gravity. We found a similar signature from infall-induced spiral arms, despite not including self-gravity in our simulation. Our study suggests that recent evidence of GI in the kinematics of the disk around AB Aur may instead be due to the observed infall, without the need for invoking GI.",

Davenport, Jeffery Cooke, Sara Webb, Igor Andreoni, Tyler Pritchard, Aaron Roodman 16 pages, 7 figures. Accepted in ApJL Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present the first derivation of a stellar flare temperature profile from single-band photometry. Stellar flare DWF030225.574-545707.45129 was detected in 2015 by the Dark Energy Camera as part of the Deeper, Wider, Faster Programme. The brightness ($\\Delta m_g = -6.12$) of this flare, combined with the high air mass ($1.45 \\lesssim X \\lesssim 1.75$) and blue filter (DES $g$, 398-548 nm) in which it was observed, provided ideal conditions to measure the zenith-ward apparent motion of the source due to differential chromatic refraction (DCR) and, from that, infer the effective temperature of the event. We model the flare's spectral energy distribution as a blackbody to produce the constraints on flare temperature and geometric properties derived from single-band photometry. We additionally demonstrate how simplistic assumptions on the flaring spectrum, as well as on the evolution of flare geometry, can result in solutions that overestimate effective temperature. Exploiting DCR enables studying chromatic phenomena with ground-based astrophysical surveys and stellar flares on M-dwarfs are a particularly enticing target for such studies due to their ubiquity across the sky, and the heightened color contrast between their red quiescent photospheres and the blue flare emission. Our novel method will enable similar temperature constraints for large sample of objects in upcoming photometric surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time.",

      "abstract": "Land use and anisotropy of artificial light observed by night time satellite Kai Pong Tong Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Upward emission of artificial light has been investigated by researchers since the commissioning of the Visible/Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) in 2011, with applications ranging from night time light mapping to quantifying socio-economical development. The wide swath of the VIIRS-DNB sensor enables detection of artificial light at multiple angles and was utilized to study emission of artificial light from cities at different angles as well as atmospheric properties. Existing studies of the relationship between the directionality and land surface features are not available for most of the Earth's surface due to the use of space-borne LiDAR as a source of proxy. To solve this problem, we compared the land use data published under the Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) against the fit parameters of radiance of upward artificial light. In general, the quadratic term of the fit, which quantifies how the brightness changes when viewing closer from the horizon at a point on the Earth, is negative when the area is \"Continuous urban fabric\" or \"Sparsely vegetated areas\", and vice versa for all other investigated land use classes. However the quadratic term shifts towards negative values for brighter areas. These results indicate that while densely built areas emit more light towards the zenith than sideways, the VIIRS-DNB is unable to distinguish small densely built areas scattered around larger unbuilt areas. Therefore, sensors with higher spatial resolution will be required to resolve the light emission patterns of areas with complicated combinations of land uses.",

SPIE 13627, Techniques and Instrumentation for Detection of Exoplanets XII, 136270L (18 September 2025) Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The James Webb Space Telescope is orders of magnitude more sensitive than any other facility across the near to mid-infrared wavelengths. Many approved programs take advantage of its highly stable point spread function (PSF) to directly detect faint companions using diverse high-contrast imaging (HCI) techniques. However, periodic re-phasing of the Optical Telescope Element (OTE) is required due to slow thermal drifts distorting to the primary mirror backplane along with stochastic tilt events on individual mirror segments. Many programs utilize observations of a reference star to remove the stellar contribution within an image which can typically take half of the total allocated time. We present a high-contrast imaging technique for the NIRISS instrument that uses the measured wavefront error (WFE) from a phase calibration observation (performed roughly every 48 hours) as prior information in a Bayesian analysis with nested sampling. This technique estimates the WFE of a given observation and simultaneously searches for faint companions, without using a reference star. We estimate the wavefront error for both full aperture and aperture masking interferometry (AMI) imaging modes using three low order Zernike coefficients per mirror segment, using the Hexike basis, to generate synthetic PSFs and compare to simulations. We compare our technique to traditional interferometric analysis in realistic NIRISS F430M simulations both relative to the photon noise limit, and through recovering an injected companion with $\\Delta$F430M= 8 mag at 0.2''. With future testing, this technique may save significant amounts of observing time given the results of our current implementation on NIRISS simulations.",

This book is not merely a collection of biographies; it is a tapestry of resilience, passion, and scientific excellence woven through the lives of women who have ventured into the cosmos from the African continent. The primary aim of this book is twofold. Firstly, it seeks to bring greater visibility to women astronomers in Africa, highlighting their groundbreaking research and the personal stories that have shaped their careers. By shining a light on their achievements and awards, we hope to acknowledge their contributions to the field of astronomy and underscore the importance of diversity in science. Secondly, this book aspires to inspire and empower the next generation of scientists, particularly young women and girls across Africa. Through the personal narratives and professional achievements of these trailblazing astronomers and students in astronomy, we aim to spark curiosity, foster a love for science, and demonstrate that the sky is not the limit but just the beginning for those who dare to dream. As you delve into the stories within these pages, you will encounter a rich array of experiences and insights that reflect the unique challenges and triumphs women face in astronomy.

      "abstract": "The impact of the point spread function fitting radius on photometric uncertainty based on the Fisher information matrix Sebastian Espinosa, Mario L.Vicuña, Rene A. Mendez, Jorge F. Silva, Marcos Orchard Accepted by A&A, 14 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) In point spread function (PSF) photometry, the selection of the fitting aperture radius plays a critical role in determining the precision of flux and background estimations. Traditional methods often rely on maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) as a criterion for aperture selection. However, S/N-based approaches do not necessarily provide the optimal precision for joint estimation problems as they do not account for the statistical limits imposed by the Fisher information in the context of the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB). This study aims to establish an alternative criterion for selecting the optimal fitting radius based on Fisher information rather than S/N. Fisher information serves as a fundamental measure of estimation precision, providing theoretical guarantees on the achievable accuracy for parameter estimation. By leveraging Fisher information, we seek to define an aperture selection strategy that minimizes the loss of precision. We conducted a series of numerical experiments that analyze the behavior of Fisher information and estimator performance as a function of the PSF aperture radius. Specifically, we revisited fundamental photometric models and explored the relationship between aperture size and information content. We compared the empirical variance of classical estimators, such as maximum likelihood and stochastic weighted least squares, against the theoretical CRLB derived from the Fisher information matrix. Our results indicate that aperture selection based on the Fisher information provides a more robust framework for achieving optimal estimation precision.",

CCAT features the 6-meter Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST), which will cover frequency bands from 210 GHz to 850 GHz using its first-generation science instrument, Prime-Cam. The detectors used in Prime-Cam are feedhorn-coupled, lumped-element superconducting microwave kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). The telescope will perform wide-area surveys at speeds on the order of degrees per second. During telescope operation, the KIDs are exposed to changes in the magnetic field caused by the telescope's movement through Earth's magnetic field and internal sources within the telescope. We present and compare measurements of the magnetic sensitivity of three different CCAT KID designs at 100 mK. The measurements are conducted in a dilution refrigerator (DR) with a set of room temperature Helmholtz coils positioned around the DR.

Reproducibility details can be found at: this https URL Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computation and Language (cs.CL) While task-specific demonstrations show early success in applying large language models (LLMs) to automate some astronomical research tasks, they only provide incomplete views of all necessary capabilities in solving astronomy problems, calling for more thorough understanding of LLMs' strengths and limitations. So far, existing benchmarks and evaluations focus on simple question-answering that primarily tests astronomical knowledge and fails to evaluate the complex reasoning required for real-world research in the discipline. Here, we address this gap by systematically benchmarking five state-of-the-art LLMs on the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics (IOAA) exams, which are designed to examine deep conceptual understanding, multi-step derivations, and multimodal analysis. With average scores of 85.6% and 84.2%, Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 (the two top-performing models) not only achieve gold medal level performance but also rank in the top two among ~200-300 participants in all four IOAA theory exams evaluated (2022-2025). In comparison, results on the data analysis exams show more divergence. GPT-5 still excels in the exams with an 88.5% average score, ranking top 10 among the participants in the four most recent IOAAs, while other models' performances drop to 48-76%. Furthermore, our in-depth error analysis underscores conceptual reasoning, geometric reasoning, and spatial visualization (52-79% accuracy) as consistent weaknesses among all LLMs. Hence, although LLMs approach peak human performance in theory exams, critical gaps must be addressed before they can serve as autonomous research agents in astronomy.",

Winn (Princeton University), Guðmundur Stefánsson (University of Amsterdam) 13 pages, submitted to AAS Journals Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The fate of hot Jupiters is thought to be engulfment by their host stars, the outcome of tidal orbital decay. Transit timing has revealed a few systems with apparently shrinking orbital periods, but such signals can be mimicked by light travel-time effects (LTTE) of a distant companion. Combining transit timings with precise radial-velocity data, including new data, we reassessed three reported cases of orbital decay: WASP-4, WASP-12, and Kepler-1658. For WASP-4, the period change is best explained by LTTE due to a 10-Jupiter-mass companion at 4 AU, with no need to invoke orbital decay. For WASP-12, in contrast, the data firmly exclude LTTE and confirm genuine orbital decay. For Kepler-1658, spectroscopic and photometric anomalies reveal the \"planet\" to be an eclipsing K/M binary bound to the F-type primary, with LTTE explaining the observed period change. Thus, among the known hot Jupiters, only WASP-12 b currently shows compelling evidence for orbital decay.",

Garrett Levine, Carlos Gascón, Morgan MacLeod, Haedam Im, Nick Tusay Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Hydrodynamic escape can strip the envelopes of close-in exoplanets, but most observations of atmospheric mass loss to date have been confined to planets orbiting K and M dwarfs. A growing body of detections of atmospheric escape from planets orbiting early-type stars indicates that they may have significantly stronger and more extended outflows than planets orbiting cooler stars. However, it is unclear whether this limited sample of planets is representative of all gas giants orbiting early-type stars. Motivated by this question, we initiated the first dedicated survey of atmospheric escape from gas giants orbiting F stars in order to understand how their distinct radiation environments shape planetary outflows. We observed ten transits of six planets in an ultra-narrowband filter centered on the metastable helium line using Palomar/WIRC. We report strong ($>3\\sigma$) detections of atmospheric escape for WASP-12~b and WASP-180~A~b, tentative ($>2\\sigma$) detections for WASP-93~b and HAT-P-8~b, and non-detections for WASP-103~b and KELT-7~b. We fit these measurements with a 1D Parker wind model to derive corresponding mass-loss rates, and combine our results with literature measurements to obtain an updated picture of mass loss from planets orbiting early-type stars. Our results indicate that the observed variation in mass-loss rates can be explained by a combination of Roche filling factor and XUV luminosity, and disfavors NUV-driven escape models.",

Bower, Anat Shahar, Christian Liebske, Julien Allaz 12 pages, 6 figures, published in Chemical Geology Chemical Geology Volume 695, 5 November 2025, 123048 Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Rocky planet atmospheres form and evolve through interactions between the planet's surface and interior. If a growing rocky planet acquires enough mass prior to the dissipation of the nebular gas disk, it can gravitationally capture a `primary' atmosphere dominated by H2. At the same time, these young, rocky bodies are likely to have partial or global magma oceans as a result of the heat from accretion, core formation and radioactive decay of short-lived major element isotopes. During this magma ocean stage, the dissolution of volatile, life-essential elements, such as hydrogen in the form of water or H2, into the magma is critical in determining the extent to which a rocky planet can maintain these elements over time. However, our ability to quantify the amount of hydrogen dissolved in the magma oceans of rocky planets is limited by the lack of experimental constraints on H-bearing species' solubilities at relevant pressure and temperature conditions, including those expected for the early Earth. Here we experimentally determine the solubility of water in silicate melts of various compositions in the Ca-Mg-Al-Si-Fe-O system at a total pressure of 1 bar and temperatures from 1673-1823 K, synthesized in a H2-CO2 gas-mixing furnace. We use Bayesian parameter estimation to derive a robust water solubility law that includes the effects of melt composition and temperature. Using this solubility law, we estimate that ~100 ppm of hydrogen can dissolve into a 1 MEarth planet with a surface pressure of ~300 bars set by accretion of solar-like nebular gas. For rocky planets in general, ingassing of a primary atmosphere may be an important source and initial storage mechanism for hydrogen-bearing species in a planet's interior, provided it grew to a sufficient mass within the lifetime of the solar nebula.",

Esposito Accepted for publication in A&A Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We report a successful observation of a stellar occultation by asteroid (16583) Oersted, enabling a detailed physical characterization of its shape, spin state, and surface properties. Our goal is to determine the physical parameters of Oersted by combining multi-chord occultation timing, sparse optical photometry, and thermal infrared observations. Such asteroids (size$\\sim$20 km) are rarely modeled in this detail due to observational limitations, making Oersted a valuable case study. We applied convex lightcurve inversion to sparse photometric data to derive an initial shape and spin state. This model was then refined and scaled using non-convex shape modeling with the ADAM algorithm, incorporating constraints from the occultation chord profile. Thermophysical modeling based on WISE thermal infrared fluxes was used to determine the asteroid's effective diameter, geometric albedo, and thermal inertia. The non-convex shape model reveals localized surface concavities and provides a size estimate consistent with radiometric measurements. The derived thermal inertia is typical for asteroids of comparable size. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining stellar occultations, photometry, and thermal infrared data for asteroid modeling and highlights the valuable contributions of citizen scientists, who played a key role in capturing the occultation and constraining the asteroid's profile.",

Wicht Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Hot Jupiters are Jupiter-sized exoplanets with close-in orbits, characterized by extreme day-night temperature contrasts due to synchronous rotation. These planets offer unique observational opportunities through transit photometry, transmission spectroscopy, and infrared (IR) phase curve analysis, which reveal information about heat redistribution and atmospheric dynamics. Complementary to common generalized circulation models (GCMs), we introduce a more comprehensive approach using the anelastic fluid equations that fully capture the three-dimensional nature of the emerging non-linear flows. We identify various non-linear flow regimes and analyze the heat distribution when irradiation and thermal advection reach equilibrium. Eastward zonal winds can reach velocities comparable to the planetary rotation (up to several kilometers per second), while slower radial flows, though less prominent, contribute significantly to heat advection and can cause both eastward and westward hotspot shifts. The efficiency of day-to-night heat redistribution and the positioning of brightness maxima are shown to depend strongly on pressure and the interplay of advective and radiative processes. These findings improve our understanding of the diversity observed in the IR phase curves and suggest a non-magnetic mechanism for retrograde hotspot shifts. By extending the scope of traditional GCM models, our work demonstrates the usefulness of anelastic models in capturing the complex, multidimensional dynamics of irradiated exoplanetary atmospheres.",

We introduce the concept of $Q^\\star_\\text{TD}$, the specific energy required to disperse half of the total mass involved in a collision, accounting for the tidal potential of a central body. We derive a simple scaling relation for $Q^\\star_\\text{TD}$ and demonstrate that for close-in planetary or asteroidal satellites, the tides from the central body can significantly reduce their catastrophic disruption threshold. We show that many satellites in the Solar System are in such a regime, where their disruption threshold should be much lower than that predicted by classical scaling laws which neglect tidal effects. Some notable examples include Mars' Phobos, Jupiter's Metis and Adrastea, Saturn's ring moons, Uranus' Ophelia, and Neptune's Naiad and Thalassa, among others. We argue that traditional impact scaling laws should be modified to account for tides when modeling the formation and evolution of these close-in satellites.

Application to the Formation of Gullies Lucas Lange, Francois Forget Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The formation of gullies on Mars has often been attributed to the melting of (sub)surface water ice. However, melting-based hypotheses generally overlook key processes: (1) sublimation cooling by latent heat absorption, (2) the non-stability of ice where melting conditions can be reached, and (3) the particular microclimates of gullied slopes. Using state-of-the-art climate simulations, we reassess ice melting scenarios over the past four million years (obliquity $\\le$35\\textdegree)), beyond the estimated period of gully formation. We find that surface melting is impossible anywhere due to sublimation cooling, while (quasi-) stable subsurface ice is typically too deep to reach melting temperatures. We propose an alternative mechanism in which seasonal CO$_2$ frost sublimation destabilizes the regolith and brings the underlying water ice close to the surface, allowing rapid heating. Even under these optimal conditions, melting requires unrealistic assumptions. The only remaining possibility is solar absorption in dusty ice, though its occurrence remains uncertain.",

Here we apply the PIE technique to a combination of JWST NIRSpec G395H transit and eclipse measurements of WASP-17b, a hot Jupiter orbiting an F-type star, obtained consecutively (0.5 phase or 1.8 days apart) as part of the JWST-TST program to perform Deep Reconnaissance of Exoplanet Atmospheres through Multi-instrument Spectroscopy (DREAMS). Using the in-eclipse measured stellar spectrum to circumvent the need for ultra-precise stellar models, we extract the first JWST nightside emission spectrum of WASP-17b using only transit and eclipse data thereby performing a controlled test of the PIE technique. From the WASP-17b nightside spectrum, we measure a nightside equilibrium temperature of $1005 \\pm 256$ K and find tentative evidence for nightside SO2 absorption ($\\ln B = 1.45$, $2.3\\sigma$). In context with the dayside, the temperature of the nightside is consistent with (1) previous eclipse mapping findings that suggest relatively inefficient day-night heat transport, and (2) a non-zero bond albedo of $0.42^{+0.06}_{-0.10}$. SO2 on the nightside, if confirmed, would represent the first direct evidence for transport-induced chemistry, matching previous model predictions, and opening a new door into the 3D nature of giant exoplanets. Our results suggest that PIE is feasible with JWST/NIRSpec for two epochs separated in time by significantly less than the rotation period of the host star.",

No further change from the last version Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) In spite of their long detection history, the origin of hot Jupiters remains to be resolved. While multiple dynamical evidence suggests high-eccentricity migration is most likely, conflicts remain when considering hot Jupiters as a population in the context of warm and cold Jupiters. Here, we turn to atmospheric signatures as an alternative mean to test the origin theory of hot Jupiters, focusing on population level trends that arise from post-formation pollution, motivated by the upcoming Ariel space mission whose goal is to deliver a uniform sample of exoplanet atmospheric constraints. We experiment with post-formation pollution by planetesimal accretion, pebble accretion, and disk-induced migration and find that an observable signature of post-formation pollution is only possible under pebble accretion in metal-heavy disks. If most hot Jupiters arrive at their present orbit by high-eccentricity migration while warm Jupiters emerge largely in situ, we expect the atmospheric water abundance of hot Jupiters to be significantly elevated compared to warm Jupiters. We report on the detectability of such signatures and further provide suggestions for future comparative atmospheric characterization between hot Jupiters and wide-orbit directly imaged planets to elucidate the properties of the dust substructures in protoplanetary disks.",
