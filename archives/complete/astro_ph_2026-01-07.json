Code and data available at this https URL Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The detection and characterization of post-merger gravitational wave signals from binary neutron star mergers remains challenging with current ground-based detectors. We present a convolutional neural network framework designed for real-time detection and multi-mode frequency extraction of post-merger signals, achieving an inference latency of 3.0 ms and a frequency accuracy of 48.6 Hz on the direct-comparison subsets (53 Hz on the comprehensive test set). The framework is validated on realistic LIGO O4 detector noise including authentic GravitySpy glitch morphologies, demonstrating ROC AUC of 0.999999 and 99.998% detection efficiency at 1% false alarm rate. These exceptional performance metrics arise from an aggressive training augmentation strategy that exposes the network to artificially challenging conditions, enabling robust generalization to our synthetic O4 detector noise model. We compare performance against a simplified matched filtering baseline using Lorentzian templates (23x more accurate despite a 4.7x computational overhead) and Bayesian parameter estimation (1.2 million times faster), establishing complementary trade-offs in the analysis landscape. While current O4 sensitivity limits post-merger detections to ~20 Mpc (~1 detection per century), this methodology provides essential infrastructure for third-generation detectors (Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer) where post-merger detection will become routine with annual detection rates exceeding 100 events. Our validation framework identifies expected behavior in uncertainty scaling that reflects realistic training constraints rather than idealized Fisher information limits, demonstrating honest assessment practices for machine learning applications in gravitational wave astronomy.",

In the ground state, the MOND potential supports bound states only in the deep-MOND regime, where the condensate becomes significantly larger than its Newtonian counterpart. The size increases with repulsive coupling parameter $\\beta$ in both potentials. A clear scaling law of the size with $\\beta^{1/3}$ emerges in the MOND case and is confirmed numerically over a wide parameter range, while for the Newtonian potential no simple scaling law exists as the Thomas-Fermi approximation ceases to be valid. For the dynamics, we derive and solve equations for the monopole collective mode. The larger MOND-bound condensate oscillates at a lower frequency, which scales as $\\beta^{-1/3}$ in the strong-interaction limit. These scaling laws provide insights for quantum-simulation experiments aiming to probe modified-gravity scenarios with cold atoms.",

In view of the upcoming next generation of ground-based detectors, it is crucial to keep improving theoretical predictions to harvest the full scientific returns from these investments. We introduce here a substantial update of our Lagrangian numerical relativity code SPHINCS_BSSN. Apart from changing our unit system, we add constraint damping terms to the BSSN spacetime evolution equations. We demonstrate that this measure reduces, without noteworthy computational cost, the Hamiltonian constraint violations by more than an order of magnitude. We further implement contributions to thermal energy and pressure that are based on Fermi liquid theory and contain a parametrization of the Dirac effective mass. These terms can be combined with any cold equation of state, and they enhance the physical realism of our simulations and introduce a physics-based concept of a temperature. In a set of merger simulations, we demonstrate good agreement with other temperature-dependent numerical relativity simulations. We find that different parametrizations of the Dirac effective mass can translate into shifts of $\\sim 150$ Hz in the dominant post-merger gravitational wave peak frequency.",

We propose that this dynamics arises from a fundamental symmetry principle: the Spontaneous Breaking of Scale Invariance. We introduce the Dilaton ($\\chi$), a Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson (PNGB) associated with dilatation symmetry breaking. We demonstrate that a simple quadratic mass term in the fundamental theory transforms, via conformal coupling to gravity, into a ''thawing'' exponential potential $V(\\phi) \\propto e^{-\\lambda\\phi}$ in the Einstein frame. Using recent Bayesian reconstructions of dark energy dynamics from Planck, Pantheon+, and SH0ES data, we constrain the potential slope to be $\\lambda \\approx 0.056$. We show that this observational value is not arbitrary but corresponds to a fundamental non-minimal coupling strength of $\\xi \\approx 7.8 \\times 10^{-4}$. The Dilaton mechanism naturally generates the late-time equation of state evolution ($w_0 \\approx -0.85$) required to alleviate the Hubble tension while protecting the field mass $m \\sim H_0$ through approximate shift symmetry.",

Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) The \\(w_{\\dagger}\\)VCDM framework provides a theoretically well-controlled extension of \\(\\Lambda\\)CDM within the class of minimally modified gravity theories, allowing for flexible cosmological background evolution and linear perturbation dynamics while remaining free of pathological instabilities. In this work, we have shown that this scenario remains robust when confronted with current cosmological observations, even in the presence of an extended neutrino sector. Combining \\textit{Planck} CMB data with DESI DR2 BAO and DESY5 supernovae, we obtain stringent constraints on neutrino physics, including \\(\\sum m_\\nu < 0.11~\\mathrm{eV}\\) (95\\% CL) and \\(N_{\\rm eff} = 2.98^{+0.13}_{-0.14}\\), fully consistent with Standard Model expectations. Crucially, the data exhibit a statistically significant preference for a late-time dark-energy transition, characterized by a robust quintessence--phantom crossing that remains stable across all dataset combinations and neutrino-sector extensions, including the presence of a sterile neutrino. The combined effects of modified late-time expansion and additional relativistic degrees of freedom systematically raise the inferred Hubble constant, substantially alleviating the \\(H_0\\) tension without invoking early dark energy or introducing theoretical instabilities. Overall, the \\(w_{\\dagger}\\)VCDM scenario emerges as a compelling phenomenological framework that simultaneously accommodates current constraints on neutrino physics, provides an excellent fit to recent BAO and supernovae data, and offers a viable pathway toward resolving persistent tensions in the standard cosmological model.",

The fields are minimally coupled to gravity and uncoupled at the level of the potential, with the quintessence sector governed by an exponential potential and the phantom sector by an inverse power-law potential. By reformulating the background equations as a five-dimensional autonomous dynamical system, we identify and analyze the fixed points and their stability properties, revealing stable late-time attractors corresponding to phantom-dominated accelerated expansion. We confront the model with observations through a Bayesian parameter estimation performed using the \\textsc{Cobaya} framework, employing several combinations of recent cosmological data sets, including Pantheon+ supernovae, compressed cosmic microwave background distance priors, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, and DES Year-5 supernova data. The observational constraints favor a dynamical dark energy sector moderately and are consistent with deviations from a cosmological constant at the present epoch. The regions of parameter space preferred by the data are compatible with the stable accelerating solutions identified in the dynamical analysis, establishing a direct connection between phase-space stability and observational viability. A notable feature of the model is that the effective dark energy equation of state undergoes phantom divide crossing in a gradual and asymptotic manner, rather than as a sharp transition.",

In this model, three parameters determine the characteristic frequency and strength of the induced gravitational waves (GWs). Considering the impact of particle production on inflation, we identify the parameter values that generate the strongest GWs without violating the slow-roll mechanism at the CMB scale. However, even with such extreme parameters, the power spectrum of induced GWs is only about $0.3\\%$ of that of vacuum GWs. This contribution remains insignificant when identifying the primary source of the detected CMB B-mode polarization. Furthermore, when our results are integrated with the constraints driven by P+ACT+LB+BK18, the contribution of induced GWs at CMB scales becomes negligible. In contrast, their impact on the scalar spectral index $n_s$ proves significant. For a range of parameter values, the Starobinsky inflation model yields predictions for $n_s$ that are consistent with the measurements obtained from P+ACT+LB+BK18.",

Updated version to reflect changes made for publication Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We study the dynamics of Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker models where a dark energy component with a quadratic equation of state (EoS) nonlinearly interacts with cold dark matter. Thus, two energy scales naturally come into play: $\\rho_*$ is the scale at which the nonlinearity of the EoS becomes relevant; $\\rho_i$ is the energy scale around which the interaction starts to play an important role in the dynamics. Our focus is to understand whether there are parameter ranges for this system that can produce non-singular bouncing and emergent cosmologies for any initial condition. We complete a dynamical systems analysis, and find the parameter range such that trajectories always expand from a high energy non-singular de Sitter state. For flat and negative curvature models this de Sitter state is represented by a fixed point, the asymptotic past from which the universe emerges from. We find a subset of positive curvature models that during contraction get arbitrarily close to the de Sitter state, thus having a quasi-de Sitter bounce, then emerge from the bounce and expand, evolving toward spatial flatness. We find that the dimensionless parameter $q\\equiv \\rho_*/\\rho_i$, which measures the relative strength of the nonlinear terms in the system, plays a crucial role in the topology of the phase space. When $q < 3$, some trajectories expand toward a singularity, while others evolve toward a low energy cosmological constant at late-times, with a subset going through a decelerated matter dominate era before the final acceleration. When $q > 3$, all trajectories are non-singular, and evolve toward a late-time cosmological constant. We find a subclass in this case in which all trajectories have at least one decelerated matter dominated phase, and accelerate at late-times.",

Comments welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We present a parameter survey of fragmentation in collapsar disks, using a revised version of the Chen & Beloborodov (2007) model that determines the structure of steady state hyperaccretion disks in a general relativistic and neutrino cooled framework. We map out the range of disk conditions leading to gravitational instability alongside an exploration of the dimensionless cooling time $\\beta$, which together determine whether fragmentation is likely to occur. We estimate the initial mass and density of fragments, finding that they occupy a unique region in the space of self-gravitating compact objects, with masses $M_{\\rm f} \\sim 10^{-3} M_\\odot -10^{-1} M_\\odot$ and densities $\\rho_{\\rm f}\\sim 10^8-10^{11}~{\\rm g~cm}^{-3}$. We then calculate their migration and mass growth (via Bondi-Hoyle accretion) as they inspiral through the collapsar disk. During a fragment's migration to the central black hole, it can grow its mass up to a range $M_{\\rm f}\\sim 10^{-1} M_\\odot - 1 M_\\odot$. In most cases, the final fragment mass is larger than the minimum cold stable neutron star mass but much smaller than any observed neutron star. The fragment briefly achieves peak accretion rates comparable to (or even larger than) that of the central engine. We propose that these bound fragments may give rise to observable astrophysical phenomena, and we approximately model two of these: (i) gamma ray burst variability produced by a secondary, fragment-launched jet; (ii) the generation of non-vacuum gravitational waveforms accompanied by electromagnetic counterparts.",

However, all galaxy catalogs are incomplete, i.e. they only include a subset of all galaxies, typically being biased towards the bright end of the luminosity distribution. This sub-selection systematically affects the dark siren inference of the Hubble constant $H_0$, so a completeness relation has to be introduced that accounts for the missing objects. In the literature it is standard to assume that the missing galaxies are uniformly distributed across the sky and that the galaxy magnitude distribution is known. In this work we develop a novel method which improves upon these assumptions and reconstructs the underlying true galaxy field, respecting the spatial correlation of galaxies on large scales. In our method the true magnitude distribution of galaxies is inferred alongside the spatial galaxy distribution. Our method results in an improved three-dimensional prior in redshift and sky position for the host galaxy of a GW event, which is expected to make the resulting $H_0$ posterior more robust. Building on our previous work, we make a number of improvements, and validate our method on simulated data based on the Millennium simulation.

By providing direct and calibration-free measurements of luminosity distances through waveform analysis, GWs provide a fundamentally different and potentially more robust approach to measuring cosmic-scale distances compared to traditional electromagnetic (EM) observations, which is known as the standard siren method. In this review, we present an overview of recent developments in GW standard siren cosmology, including up-to-date $H_0$ constraints, and prospects for constraining cosmological parameters using future GW detections. A central focus of this review is the unique ability of GW observations to break cosmological parameter degeneracies inherent in the EM observations. We also briefly highlight the impact of systematic uncertainties, such as detector calibration, weak lensing, peculiar velocities, and host-galaxy catalog completeness, and corresponding potential mitigation strategies, which currently limit the constraint precision of cosmological parameters. Looking forward, we highlight the importance of combining GW standard sirens with other emerging late-universe cosmological probes such as fast radio bursts, 21 cm intensity mapping, and strong gravitational lensing to forge a precise cosmological probe for exploring the late universe.",

However, such a phantom-crossing dark energy evolution further exacerbates the already severe Hubble tension in the $\\Lambda$CDM model. Moreover, there exists a $\\sim2\\sigma$ tension between the DESI DR2 BAO and CMB datasets. Therefore, it is essential to measure the Hubble constant and dark-energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameters using only late-universe observations. In this work, we investigate a novel late-universe data combination: gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens, BAO, and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). This combination provides a fully distance-ladder- and CMB-independent determination of the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS. Using 47 GW standard sirens from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog, the DESI DR2 BAO data, and DESY5 SNe Ia data, in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, we obtain $H_0=74.8^{+6.3}_{-8.9}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $\\Omega_{\\rm m}=0.320^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$, $w_0=-0.775^{+0.072}_{-0.074}$, and $w_a=-0.80\\pm0.47$, indicating a mild phantom-crossing behavior within the $1\\sigma$ credible interval with an $H_0$ value consistent with the distance ladder measurements. Our analysis demonstrates the power of GW standard sirens in breaking parameter degeneracies, and this novel data combination provides joint constraints on the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS parameters.",

White paper submitted to ESO Expanding Horizons call Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th) Understanding dense matter under extreme conditions is one of the most fundamental puzzles in modern physics. Complex interactions give rise to emergent, collective phenomena. While nuclear experiments and Earth - based colliders provide valuable insights, much of the quantum chromodynamics phase diagram at high density and low temperature remains accessible only through astrophysical observations of neutron stars, neutron star mergers, and stellar collapse. Astronomical observations thus offer a direct window to the physics on subatomic scales with gravitational waves presenting an especially clean channel. Next-generation gravitational - wave observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, would serve as unparalleled instruments to transform our understanding of neutron star matter. They will enable the detection of up to tens of thousands of binary neutron star and neutron star - black hole mergers per year, a dramatic increase over the few events accessible with current detectors. They will provide an unprecedented precision in probing cold, dense matter during the binary inspiral, exceeding by at least an order of magnitude what current facilities can achieve. Moreover, these observatories will allow us to explore uncharted regimes of dense matter at finite temperatures produced in a subset of neutron star mergers, areas that remain entirely inaccessible to current instruments. Together with multimessenger observations, these measurements will significantly deepen our knowledge of dense nuclear matter.",

      "abstract": "Testing supermassive primordial black holes with lensing signals of binary black hole merges Huan Zhou, Bin Liu, Zheng-Xiang Li, Xi-Jing Wang, Kai Liao Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Next-generation ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors are expected to observe millions of binary black hole mergers, a fraction of which will be strongly lensed by intervening galaxies or clusters, producing multiple images with characteristic distribution of time delay. Importantly, the predicted rate and properties of such events are sensitive to the abundance and distribution of strong lensing objects which directly depends on cosmological models. One such scenario posits the existence of supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) in the early universe, which would enhance the formation of dark matter halos. This mechanism has been proposed to explain the abundance of high-redshift galaxies observed by James Webb Space Telescope. Crucially, the same cosmological model with SMPBHs would also leave a distinct imprint on the population of strongly lensed GWs. It predicts both an increased event rate and a modified distribution of time delays between the multiple images. Therefore, we propose statistical measurements of the rate and time delay distribution of strong lensing GW events as a powerful probe to directly constrain the abundance of SMPBHs. Considering $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology with (non-)clustered SMPBHs, we find that the abundance of SMPBHs $f_{\\rm PBH}$ with masses above $10^8~M_{\\odot}$ is constrained to be $\\sim10^{-4}$ at $95\\%$ confidence level. It will be comparable and complementary to the currently available constraint from large scale structure observations.",

Dux, F. Courbin, M.M. Muminov 7 pages, 8 figures. Accepted for publication in MNRAS Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present results from a seven-season (2018-2024) monitoring campaign of the gravitationally lensed quasar system PS J2305+3714 using the 1.5-m Maidanak Telescope in the optical R-band. From these data, the amplitude of possible microlensing variability does not exceed 10 mmag on a 7-yr timescale. Additionally, we measure a time delay of $t_{AB}$ = 52.2$\\pm$2.5 days, with the brighter image A leading. Long-slit \\WHT spectroscopy refines the quasar redshift to $z_s$ = 1.791 and provides the first measurement of the lens redshift, $z_d$ = 0.473. The flux ratios of the quasar images in the MgII $\\lambda$2800 emission line and in the adjacent continuum are nearly identical, indicating minimal microlensing effects in the spectral domain, which is consistent with the very weak microlensing signal in the time domain. Using precise astrometry from recent HST imaging and the MgII flux ratio, we also built two simple mass models for the lens system. The close agreement between the measured delay and those predicted by the mass models, measured redshifts, and a concordance $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, confirms the robustness of our results and highlights PS J2305+3714 as a promising system for future time-delay cosmography.",

      "abstract": "Effective dark matter component presents a robust signature of negative pressure by the DESI observations Hao Xu, Xinhe Meng Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Comprehensive cosmological analysis of an effective non-standard dark matter(NSDM) model, characterized by an equation of state $w_{\\mathrm{dm}} = w_2 a^2$, which allows for mild deviations from the previously assumed pressureless cold dark matter, is elaborated in the present work. This effective description framework is the scenarios that matter contents coupled to three distinct single-parameter dynamical dark energy models: i.e, the thawing scalar field, the Modified Emergent Dark Energy(MEDE) scenario, and the constant-$w$ model. We constrain these frameworks by using the latest cosmological probes, including the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background(CMB) distance priors, the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation(BAO) measurements from the Data Release 2 of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument(DESI), and three compilations of Type Ia Supernovae(SN Ia) namely the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) compilation, the Union3 compilation, and the PantheonPlus (PP) sample. Across all three dark energy scenarios and all dataset combinations, we find a consistent preference for negative values of the parameter $w_2$. Furthermore, this result is robust against the choice of dark energy parametrization, suggesting a model-independent deviation from \"standard\" cold dark matter. This result indicates that the dark matter fluid possesses a small but non-vanishing negative pressure, meaning a non-cold nature. While the inferred Hubble constant $H_0$ remains consistent with the Planck $\\Lambda$CDM value and does not fully alleviate the $H_0$ tension with local measurements, the persistent detection of $w_2 < 0$ across a wide range of independent cosmological probes provides compelling evidence for new physics in the dark matter sector -- suggesting that dark matter may be better described as an effective fluid endowed with a mild negative pressure, rather than as a perfectly cold, pressureless substance.",

Although the model remains highly successful when confronted with individual datasets, joint analyses expose a network of tensions involving the Hubble constant, CMB lensing, curvature, neutrino masses, and the nature of dark energy. In this contribution to the 3rd General Meeting of the COST Action COSMIC WISPers (CA21106), within the context of Working Group~2, we critically assess these discrepancies, emphasizing the role of model assumptions, parameter degeneracies, and dataset consistency. We review proposed early- and late-time solutions, discuss how recent DESI BAO results alter the viability of late-time extensions, and explore interacting dark-sector scenarios. Our analysis highlights the need for caution in interpreting cosmological measurements and underscores the importance of internal consistency among cosmological probes before claiming percent-level accuracy or invoking new physics.",

Gorenstein Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) In gravitational lensing, the Mass-Sheet Transformation (MST)-or mass-sheet degeneracy-leaves image positions unchanged while scaling magnifications and time delays. The transformation scales the lens mass distribution and superposes a uniform mass sheet, but this formulation offers no clear physical interpretation. Here I show that the MST follows directly from a scaling symmetry that becomes apparent when the ray-trace relation is written in proper-distance coordinates. In this form, the ray-trace relation isolates a geometric focusing term. Subtracting this term from the deflection law defines the Image-Selection Relation (ISR), which determines image positions, magnifications, and differential time delays. The ISR exhibits a scaling symmetry that leaves image positions unchanged while scaling magnifications and time delays. Restoring the geometric focusing term then gives a ray-trace relation related to the original one by the Mass-Sheet Transformation.",

Marggraf Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The Euclid mission seeks to understand the Universe expansion history and the nature of dark energy, which requires a very accurate estimate of redshift distribution. Achieving this accuracy relies on reference samples with spectroscopic redshifts, together with a procedure to match them to survey sources for which only photometric redshifts are available. One important source of systematic uncertainty is the mismatch in photometric properties between galaxies in the Euclid survey and the reference objects. We develop a method to degrade the photometry of objects with deep photometry to match the properties of any shallower survey in the multi-band photometric space, preserving all the correlations between the fluxes and their uncertainties. We compare our transfer method with more demanding image-based methods, such as Balrog from the Dark Energy Survey Collaboration. According to metrics, our method outperforms Balrog. We implement it in the redshift distribution reconstruction, based on the self-organising map approach of arXiv:1509.03318, and test it using a realistic sample from the Euclid Flagship Simulation. We find that the key ingredient is to ensure that the reference objects are distributed in the colour space the same way as the wide-survey objects, which can be efficiently achieved with our transfer method. In our best implementation, the mean redshift biases are consistently reduced across the tomographic bins, bringing a significant fraction of them within the Euclid accuracy requirements in all tomographic bins. Equally importantly, the tests allow us to pinpoint which step in the calibration pipeline has the strongest impact on achieving the required accuracy. Our approach also reproduces the overall redshift distributions, which are crucial for applications such as angular clustering.",

We compute the critical and virial overdensities and use these to evaluate the halo mass function within several commonly employed formalisms. Building on the reaction method, we develop a flexible and accurate framework for computing the nonlinear matter power spectrum across a broad class of viable modified gravity models within luminal Horndeski theories. The framework interfaces seamlessly with EFTCAMB and is applicable to both covariant Horndeski models and effective field theory descriptions of dark energy, allowing for a range of background cosmologies. This approach enables systematic exploration of a wide space of theories and cosmological parameters, with the goal of informing future analyses of upcoming large-scale structure surveys.",

Such UDMH can result from rare curvature fluctuations on small scales whose amplitude is still well below the current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectral distortion limits. Gas accreted by the UDMH is heated to virial temperatures above which atomic cooling is efficient, cools rapidly to about $\\sim 8000$ K and collapses on the free fall time of few $10^4$ yr to the halo core, until supported by rotation. Further fragmentation due to molecular cooling is prevented by the suppression of $H_2$ molecule formation by the CMB photons at redshifts $z> 200-400$. We find that the rotationally supported gas disk will be compact and massive enough to undergo self-gravitational instability in some cases, plausibly where accretion is into a nearly spherical UDMH which has formed from a rare peak in the density field. This results in a further, rapid transfer of mass inwards due to viscous forces and gravitational torques leading to the formation of a supermassive star and/or black hole of about $10^3 M_\\odot$ at redshifts of a few hundred, with abundances comparable to galaxies. Such intermediate mass black holes formed at high redshifts can seed the first super massive black holes and help explain the abundance of active galaxies detected now at increasingly larger redshifts by the James Webb Space Telescope.",

Accepted for publication in PASJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Galaxy clusters provide an ideal laboratory for investigating the chemical enrichment history of the universe because they host the hot intracluster medium (ICM), which contains various chemical elements. The X-ray observations have constituted a unique way to measure the element abundance and composition of the ICM due to their prominent emission lines in the 0.1-10 keV range. We explore the metal abundances and chemical enrichment in the cool-core galaxy cluster, Ophiuchus, by using a 217 ks XRISM data set. The abundances of Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni are accurately determined using high-resolution spectroscopy. We find that the average uncertainties of chemical composition, which are reported as X/Fe ratios, are only 10-20%. The X/Fe abundance pattern of the Ophiuchus centre is remarkably consistent with solar, which is reminiscent of the Hitomi constraint on the Perseus core. The observed abundance pattern can be replicated globally by linear combination models of core-collapse, including massive progenitors, and Type Ia supernovae. While nucleosynthesis models typically underestimate the Ca/Fe ratio, a substantial contribution of Ca-rich gap transients may help improve the deficit of Ca. High-resolution spectroscopic data can enable us to estimate the underlying impact on the chemical enrichment from subclasses of Type Ia supernovae.",

Our approach combines information about primordial non-Gaussianity contained in the squeezed bispectrum and the collapsed trispectrum of large-scale structure together in a computationally amenable and consistent way, while avoiding the need to model complicated covariances of higher $N$-point functions. This work generalizes our recent work, which used a neural network estimate of local power, to the more conventional local power spectrum statistics, and explores using both matter field and halo catalogues from the Quijote simulations. We find that higher $N$-point functions of the matter field can provide strong constraints on $f_{NL}$, but higher $N$-point functions of the halo field, at the halo density of Quijote, only marginally improve constraints from the two-point function.",

Clues about their fundamental properties may emerge from discrepancies in cosmological measurements across different epochs of cosmic history. Possible interactions between them could leave distinctive imprints on cosmological observables, offering a rare window into dark sector physics beyond the standard $\\Lambda$CDM framework. We present compelling evidence that DM-neutrino interactions can resolve the persistent structure growth parameter discrepancy, $S_8 = \\sigma_8\\,\\sqrt{\\Omega_m/0.3}$, between early and late universe observations. By incorporating cosmic shear measurements from current Weak Lensing surveys, we demonstrate that an interaction strength of $u \\sim 10^{-4}$ not only provides a coherent explanation for the high-multipole observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (\\texttt{ACT}), but also alleviates the $S_8$ discrepancy. Combining early universe constraints with \\texttt{DES Y3 cosmic shear} data yields a nearly $3\\sigma$ preference for non-zero DM neutrino interactions. This strengthens previous observational claims and provides a clear path toward a significant breakthrough in cosmological research. Our findings challenge the standard $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm and highlight the potential of future large-scale structure surveys, which can rigorously test this interaction and unveil the fundamental properties of DM.",

Considerably Revised version with experimental data fitting Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Magnetic reconnection in magnetized wakes of cosmic strings results in the release of a large amount of energy. This energy is released in a short period of time. In this work, we show that this sudden release of energy can result in a Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) of short duration. The magnetic reconnection occurs at several points of the cosmic string wake. The emerging shocks from these points have different velocities. These shocks will collide with each other and give rise to short bursts of energy. The emitted pulse of energy depends on the background magnetic field and the timescale associated with the magnetic reconnection in the cosmic string wake. We also obtain the synthetic lightcurve that occurs from multiple collisions of the shock waves that are emitted from the multiple points of magnetic reconnection in the wake region. Finally, we fit the current experimental data of short GRB which are in the same energy range as the ones predicted from our model.",

Blending introduces a challenge to weak-lensing cosmology probes since such blends are subject to shear signals from multiple redshifts. This effect can be described by joining shear bias and redshift characterisation in the effective redshift distribution, $n_{\\gamma}(z)$, which includes the response of apparent shapes of detected objects to shear of galaxies at redshift, $z$. In this work, we propose a novel method to correct $n_{\\gamma}(z)$ for redshift-mixed blending by emulating the shear response to neighbouring galaxies. We designed a `half-sky-shearing' simulation with Subaru Hyper Suprime Cam (HSC) wide-like specifications, which allowed us to extract the response of a detected object's measured ellipticity to the shearing of neighbouring galaxies among numerous galaxy pairs. We demonstrate the feasibility of accurately emulating these pairwise responses and validate the robustness of our approach under varying observing conditions and galaxy population uncertainties. We find that the effective redshift of sources at the high-redshift tail of the distribution is about 0.05 lower than expected when the effect is not modelled. Given adequately processed image simulations, our correction method can be readily incorporated into future cosmological analyses to mitigate this source of systematic error.",

Lindholm Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) This is the second paper in the HOWLS (higher-order weak lensing statistics) series exploring the usage of non-Gaussian statistics for cosmology inference within Euclid. With respect to our first paper, we develop a full tomographic analysis based on realistic photometric redshifts that allows us to derive Fisher forecasts in the ($\\sigma_8$, $w_0$) plane for a Euclid-like data release 1 (DR1) setup. We find that the five higher-order statistics (HOS) that satisfy the Gaussian likelihood assumption of the Fisher formalism (one-point probability distribution function, $\\ell$1-norm, peak counts, Minkowski functionals, and Betti numbers) each outperform the shear two-point correlation functions by a factor of $2.5$ on the $w_0$ forecasts, with only marginal improvement when used in combination with two-point estimators, suggesting that every HOS is able to retrieve both the non-Gaussian and Gaussian information of the matter density field. The similar performance of the different estimators is explained by a homogeneous use of multi-scale and tomographic information, optimized to lower computational costs. These results hold for the three mass mapping techniques of the Euclid pipeline, aperture mass, Kaiser--Squires, and Kaiser--Squires plus, and they are unaffected by the application of realistic star masks. Finally, we explored the use of HOS with the Bernardeau--Nishimichi--Taruya (BNT) nulling scheme approach, finding promising results toward applying physical scale cuts to HOS.",

By numerically solving the multifield background and linear perturbation equations, we identify distinct dynamical regimes controlled by the Higgs non-minimal coupling $\\xi_h$. For $\\xi_h \\sim \\mathcal{O}(0.1)$, transient turning of the inflationary trajectory leads to a transfer between adiabatic and isocurvature modes, generating localized features in the primordial curvature power spectrum. In contrast, in the weak-coupling regime $\\xi_h \\ll 1$, the curvature spectrum remains nearly featureless while isocurvature perturbations do not fully decay, resulting in a residual isocurvature component at the end of inflation. We compute the associated CMB angular power spectra and discuss the observational implications of these regimes. Our results highlight the role of multifield dynamics in shaping primordial perturbations and provide constraints on viable realizations of Higgs--$R^2$ inflation.",

Previous works considered only intact low-mass galaxies in the MW and LG, neglecting disrupted galaxies such as stellar streams and phase-mixed objects. Using the FIRE-2 simulations, we show that these disrupted galaxies contribute up to $\\sim50\\%$ of the total stellar mass budget of the proto-MW/LG at $z =6-9$. Including all the progenitors of these disrupted galaxies improves the normalization of the recovered SMFs/UVLFs by factors of $\\sim2-3$ and reduces the halo-to-halo variation in the slope by $\\sim20-40\\%$. This enables robust constraints down to at least the resolution limit of the simulations, near $M_\\star$ $\\sim$ $10^{5}$ $M_\\odot$ or $M_{\\mathrm{UV}} \\sim -10$ at $z \\gtrsim 6$. We also show that `fossil record' reconstructions - which assume each present-day system descends from a single reionization-era progenitor - are sensitive to the stellar mass/UV magnitude thresholds, which introduces bias in the inferred low-mass/faint-end slopes. Additionally, we demonstrate that neglecting disrupted systems underestimates the contribution of galaxies with $M_{\\mathrm{UV}} \\lesssim -15$ to the reionization-era UV luminosity density. Finally, we estimate that a significant fraction ($\\sim50\\%$) of streams with $M_\\star$ $\\gtrsim$ $10^{6}$ $M_\\odot$ at $z=0$ should be detectable from upcoming Rubin Observatory and Roman Space Telescope observations.",

Roberts, R. van Weeren 13 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The environment plays an important role in shaping the evolution of cluster galaxies through mechanisms such as ram pressure stripping (RPS), whose effect may be enhanced in merging clusters. We investigate a complex of three galaxies UGC 6697, CGCG 097-073, and CGCG 097-079, that are currently undergoing extreme RPS, as evident from their multi-wavelength-detected tails. The galaxies are members of the nearby ($d=92$ Mpc) merging cluster Abell 1367 and are located in proximity to an intracluster medium (ICM) shock that is traced by X-ray observations and the presence of a radio relic. We analyzed LOFAR and MeerKAT observations at frequencies of 54, 144, 817, and 1270 MHz to perform a detailed spectral analysis of the tails. We found that all three tails are significantly more extended than in previous radio studies, with lengths of $\\geq70$ kpc. For UGC 6697, we detected a tail of 300 kpc, making it the longest known RPS tail of a star-forming galaxy at any wavelength. The length and spectral variations of the tail cannot be explained purely by the spectral aging of stripped cosmic rays. We construct a model of the tail that includes compression and re-acceleration due to the encounter with the nearby ICM shock, which can plausibly account for the extreme RPS as well as the length and spectral variation of the tail. We further discover a radio plume at the leading edge of UGC 6697 that connects to a narrow filament. These sources exhibit extremely steep ($\\alpha\\approx-1.7$) and highly curved spectra. We speculate that this emission arises from cosmic rays re-energized by UGC 6697's rapid infall that propagate along magnetic filaments in the cluster center. Our findings represent direct evidence of a cluster merger shock impacting the evolution of member galaxies. Furthermore, we report the first tentative detection of particle acceleration at the leading edge of an infalling galaxy.",

These particle showers broadly exhibit universality across diverse media, including air, water, ice, and other materials, with their development governed by the Standard Model. Full Monte Carlo simulation of particle showers, where each secondary is individually tracked and propagated, can be a computational challenge to perform at scale. Experiments thus resort to parametrized approximations when efficient simulation becomes necessary. Here, we construct distributions of parameters capable of describing the Cherenkov light yield from particle showers in ice, and extensible to other, similar media. Sampling from the distributions allows for a much improved description of event-to-event fluctuations, in amplitude and shape, along the shower axis. Including these effects is essential for a more accurate simulation of signal and background events in current and next-generation neutrino telescopes.",

We describe the landscape of source and gas properties that are expected to form H, He I and He II emission lines, and map spectral types to the parameter space of luminosity and system radius. Using one-dimensional radiative transfer calculations, we show that high source luminosities ($L > 10^{44}\\,\\rm erg~s^{-1}$) and compact ejecta radii ($r < 10^{14}\\,\\rm cm$) produce featureless spectra due to the high temperature and ionization state of the emitting medium. Intermediate luminosities and moderately compact systems can generate He II-dominated spectra, while lower luminosities and more extended atmospheres result in conspicuous H and He I emission. Large expansion velocities ($v \\geq 0.1c$) can further broaden lines such that they blend into the continuum. Featureless UV spectra may require even more extreme ionization conditions or velocities to suppress the many intrinsically strong metal lines at those wavelengths. Applying this framework to understand the absence of features observed in LFBOTs and featureless TDEs, we find that non-homologous, compact outflows are likely necessary for featurelessness to persist in optical and UV spectra.",

Ultra heavy ions ($Z \\gg 26$) can be accelerated to cosmic ray energies by the reverse shock as the ejecta decelerates by interacting with the ambient environment. We investigate the contribution of magnetars to the local ultra heavy cosmic ray flux using semi-analytic Galactic transport calculations, demonstrating that they may be significant contributors throughout Galactic history depending on the giant flare rate and ion acceleration efficiency. Although neutron star mergers inject orders of magnitude more energy into cosmic rays, they rarely occur within the spallation-limited propagation horizon for ultra heavy species, reducing their local contributions. As compared to lighter nuclei which are dominantly accelerated by supernovae, the SuperTIGER experiment has presented tentative evidence for a distinct contribution to the cosmic ray abundances near and above the first $r$-process peak ($Z \\approx 35\\text{--}56$). We argue that current abundance data are consistent with either a magnetar giant flare or neutron star merger origin for these species. Measurements with single element resolution through the third $r$-process peak, expected from the upcoming TIGERISS experiment, may discriminate between these sources for the heaviest cosmic rays.",

In this system, two distinct modes of density fluctuations, referred to as the charged mode and the neutral mode, are theoretically expected to arise through parametric instabilities. Our simulations confirm these predictions: in the charged mode, the electron and positron densities fluctuate oppositely (Langmuir-like), while in the neutral mode, the charge is Debye-screened and both species fluctuate in phase (acoustic-like). The linear growth rates obtained from the simulations are in good agreement with analytical estimates for both modes. We also find that, in some cases, the linear growth saturates before full scattering occurs, allowing the incident wave to propagate without significant attenuation. Our results allow us to determine whether induced Compton scattering grows linearly in magnetized pair plasmas, offering a foundation for studies of fast radio bursts and laser-plasma experiments.",

Filippenko, Thomas G. Brink, Liyang Chen, Ruifeng Huang, Lifan Wang High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present multiband photometric and spectroscopic observations of supernova (SN) 2024abvb, which exhibits early-time prominent photoionized narrow emission lines of C II superposed on a blue continuum. The absence of Balmer features indicates that the SN exploded within hydrogen-poor circumstellar matter (CSM). Together with the lack of explicit evidence of helium signatures, we tentatively identify SN 2024abvb as a Type Icn SN (SN Icn). After correcting for extinction, we estimate an r-band peak absolute magnitude of -19.7, placing SN 2024abvb in the luminous regime of SNe Icn. We adopted a hybrid model that accounts for both the energy released by the ejecta-CSM interaction and the radioactive decay of nickel synthesized in the SN ejecta to fit the light curve of SN 2024abvb. The best-fit model to the multiband light curves within the first ~ 40 days after explosion suggests that the CSM, radioactive nickel, and ejecta masses to be 0.28 Msun, 3.54 * 10-3 Msun, and 0.12 Msun, respectively. Such a low ejecta mass indicates that the progenitor star of SN 2024abvb experienced a significant mass-stripping process, consistent with the hydrogen-poor and helium-poor spectral features. SN 2024abvb provides important insights into the physical origins of the rare subclass of SNe Icn.",

To be published in the Journal Universe High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Ejecta from core-collapse supernovae interact with the circumstellar medium shed by the progenitor star, producing X-ray emission. Previous studies analyzed the X-ray spectrum of the Type IIb supernova SN 2011dh up to 500 days after explosion. Long-term monitoring of X-ray emission provides valuable constraints on supernova evolution and progenitor systems, yet such studies remain rare for Type IIb events due to limited data. Here we present the most comprehensive X-ray light curve of SN 2011dh to date, combining all available Chandra and XMM-Newton data with previously published and newly released Swift observations, extending coverage to 5100 days. We measure a luminosity decline proportional to t$^{-0.74 \\pm 0.04}$ and infer a mass-loss rate of $(1.0-2.2) \\times 10^{-6}$ solar masses per year for $v_w = 10$ km/s, or $(2.0-4.4) \\times 10^{-6} $ solar masses per year for $v_w = 20$ km/s. These estimates agree with earlier results, supporting the interpretation that the X-ray emission has been dominated by an adiabatic reverse shock. The consistency of our late-time results with previous studies demonstrates that SN 2011dh has evolved steadily for nearly 14 years.",

In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework utilizing a ResNet-50 encoder pre-trained via supervised contrastive learning to classify CCSN signals and distinguish them from instrumental noise artifacts. Our approach explicitly optimizes the feature space to maximize intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Using a simulated four-detector network (LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston, Virgo, and KAGRA) and realistic datasets injecting magnetorotational and neutrino-driven waveforms, we demonstrate that the contrastive learning paradigm establishes a superior metric structure within the embedding space, significantly enhancing detection efficiency. At a false positive rate of $10^{-4}$, our method achieves a true positive rate (TPR) of nearly $100\\%$ for both rotational and neutrino-driven signals within a distance range of $10$--$200$~kpc, while maintaining a TPR of approximately $80\\%$ at $1200$~kpc. In contrast, traditional end-to-end methods yield a TPR below $20\\%$ for rotational signals at distances $\\geq 200$~kpc, and fail to exceed $60\\%$ for neutrino-driven signals even at a close proximity of $10$~kpc.",

Extending our previous work that highlighted the significance of secondary inverse Compton (IC) emission from annihilation-produced electrons, we expand the analysis to a broader range of WIMP masses and introduce a more realistic spatially-dependent modelling framework for the GC environment. This approach incorporates complexities such as the three-dimensional DM distribution, spatially varying radiation and magnetic fields, and electron transport mechanisms like Galactic winds and diffusion. We assess the impact of these environmental factors on both the spatial and spectral characteristics of the resulting secondary emissions. Our results demonstrate the robustness and necessity of incorporating this emission, and highlight its role in enhancing the prospects for detecting heavy WIMPs through observations of the inner Galaxy.

Archival XMM-Newton observations of 12 active galactic nuclei were analyzed to constrain properties of these absorbers. Our analysis demonstrates that the soft X-ray variability is primarily governed by fluctuation of the partial covering fraction of mildly ionized clumpy clouds. In particular, for Mrk 335, PDS 456, and 1H 0707-495, outflow velocities of the clumpy absorbers are constrained from the blue-shifts of the Fe-L edge structure. The blue-shifted Fe-L edge successfully reproduces the well-known complex spectral feature near 1 keV in 1H 0707--495, which was often explained by invoking an ad hoc absorption structure. Notably, the inferred outflow velocities of the clumpy absorbers are comparable to, or even exceed, those associated with the Ultra-Fast Outflows (UFOs). Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between the outflow velocities and the intrinsic X-ray fluxes in two of four data sets, and the remaining two datasets also agree with this positive correlation, which supports a radiative-driven wind scenario that the X-ray/UV emission from the central black holes is causing the UFOs and the outflowing clumpy absorbers. In addition, the line-driven acceleration is likely playing a significant role, since the line opacities of the clumpy absorbers are highly sensitive to the flux changes. These findings provide a robust observational support for the ``hot inner and clumpy outer wind'' paradigm, suggesting a common origin for both the UFOs and the clumpy absorbers.",

Under review in A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) IceCube observations point to Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) as promising contributors to the observed astrophysical neutrino flux. Close to the central black hole, protons can be accelerated through magnetic reconnection to very high energies and subsequently interact with abundant X-ray photons in the source, leading to neutrino production. We investigate whether the diffuse neutrino flux observed by IceCube can originate, via proton acceleration, in reconnection-powered coronae of non-jetted AGN. We create a library of neutrino spectral templates, over a large grid of values for the three key model parameters: the proton plasma magnetization of the corona $\\sigma_{\\rm p}$, the X-ray coronal luminosity, and the black hole mass. Synchrotron cooling of pions and muons plays a significant role due to the large coronal magnetic fields. We couple the single-source model with a mock AGN catalog, consistent with the observed X-ray and mid-infrared AGN samples at redshifts $z=0-4$, to infer the diffuse neutrino flux. Coronal emission satisfactorily explains the most recent IceCube measurements of the diffuse neutrino flux up to energies of $\\sim 1$~PeV, provided that $\\sim$10\\% of the AGN coronae have $\\sigma_{\\rm p} \\sim 10^5$, while the rest are distributed over a range of lower magnetizations.

We identified 21 such objects by crossmatching a ULX catalog with the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) and Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). They may have a diverse population. (i) Three have a double lobed radio structure with a compact core found in two of them, and could be quasars. (ii) Five are associated with extended radio structure and star forming regions in optical, where the radio emission is likely due to star forming activities, although the steep radio spectrum up to several GHz casts doubt on that. Two of them show X-ray variability suggesting that they are ULXs embedded in star forming regions. (iii) Thirteen are associated with an unresolved radio source, with a steep spectrum seen in eight, a flat or inverted spectrum seen in two. Those with a steep spectrum are arguably candidates for SS 433/W50 like objects, with radio emission due to optically thin synchrotron radiation in a surrounding jet/wind powered nebula. Remarkable cases include NGC 925 ULX1 and NGC 6946 ULX1, which are associated with an optical nebula. Those with a flat or inverted spectrum could be accreting black holes with a compact jet, while the black hole mass is estimated to be several $10^6 - 10^8$ $M_\\odot$ based on the fundamental plane.

Submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We report the discovery of giant pulse (GP) emission from the transitional millisecond pulsar (tMSP) PSR J1227$-$4853, using 174 hours of single-pulse data from the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). This marks the first detection of GPs from a transitional MSP and adds to the small number of millisecond pulsars known to exhibit such extreme variability. A total of 235 GPs were detected across observations at 550-750 MHz, with widths as narrow as $1.28~\\mu s$ and flux densities up to $\\sim 10^4$ times the pulsar's mean flux density. The GPs are strongly localized in pulse phase, originating predominantly from the second and third main-pulse components, and are absent in the inter-pulse region. The arrival times of the GPs deviate significantly from Poisson statistics, with the waiting-time distribution well described by a Weibull model having a shape parameter of $k = 0.30$, indicative of strong temporal clustering. During an epoch of enhanced activity, the GP rate increased by nearly two orders of magnitude to $124~\\mathrm{hr}^{-1}$, with a corresponding shape parameter of $k = 0.47$. This value is similar to that reported for a burst storm from the repeating fast radio burst FRB 20200120E, suggesting possible phenomenological parallels between GPs from compact binary systems and repeating FRBs.",

In this work, we compile a sample of 124 GRBs with known redshifts and simultaneous X-ray and optical afterglow observations. We categorize them into four subsets based on the existence of plateaus and the bands in which they appear. Namely, Dataset 1: plateaus are detected simultaneously in both X-ray and optical bands (75 bursts); Dataset 2: plateaus are only in X-rays (15 bursts); Dataset 3: plateaus appear only in the optical (17 bursts); Dataset 4: no plateaus in either band (17 bursts). We employ these datasets to test the applicability of the energy-injection model by examining whether the temporal decay index $\\alpha$ and the spectral index $\\beta$ of GRB afterglows simultaneously satisfy the closure relations in X-ray and optical bands. We find that 47 bursts of Dataset 1 simultaneously obey the closure relations in both bands under the conditions of the electron spectral index $p>2$ and the injection parameter $q\\in (0, 0.5)$, and 69 of the dataset for $p>1$ and $q\\in (0, 0.8)$, providing a strong support for the energy-injection interpretation. However, for Datasets 2 and 3, although $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ of the plateaus mostly satisfy the closure relations, those in the other band show significant deviations, which implies that bursts with a single-band plateau are inconsistent with the interpretation of energy injection. Furthermore, we also compare the isotropic X-ray energy of plateaus with the rotational energy budget of millisecond magnetars.",

We measure the hard X-ray polarization angle and find it to be consistent with the previously measured position angle of the radio jet. Leveraging NuSTAR's detection of both the relativistic Fe K emission line and the Compton hump, we constrain the flux contribution of the reflected emission from the inner accretion disk to be 10% of the total X-ray flux in the IXPE energy band. Unlike previous studies that modeled only the Fe K emission line, we fit the full-band reflection spectrum using a fully relativistic disk model. There is strong degeneracy between the Comptonized and reflection components. Given that the Comptonized component is not expected to be highly polarized, a polarization degree of approximately 20% for the reflection component could explain the X-ray polarization data from IXPE. We also discuss the disk inclination angle inferred from our spectro-polarimetric modeling, as well as other possible explanations for the data.",

The ergostar hypothesis, that a rapidly rotating star with an ergoregion drives the relativistic jet, offers an alternative explanation to the black hole-accretion disk paradigm. However, previous studies based on conventional neutron star equations of state (EOSs) have shown that dynamically stable ergostars do not exist unless very extreme EOS or rotation are adopted, casting significant doubt on their astrophysical viability in reality. In this work, however, we examine this hypothesis using a phenomenological EOS of strangeon matter, i.e., condensed matter with nucleon-like units for three flavors of quarks. By constructing a large suite of uniformly rotating equilibrium models, we systematically investigate the parameter space of the stable ergostars and calculate their maximum extractable energy. In contrast to the case of conventional EOSs, we demonstrate that strangeon matter supports a vast and robust parameter space for dynamically stable ergostars, even without requiring differential rotation. We find that the extractable rotational energy from these configurations can be on the order of $0.01 M_\\odot$, a reservoir sufficient to power a typical sGRB. Our results revitalize the ergostar as a viable central engine for sGRB, suggesting that BNS merger remnants composed of exotic matter could play a crucial, previously underestimated role in high-energy astrophysics.",

This suggests that neutrinos are produced via hadronic interactions in a region opaque to gamma-rays, likely a hot corona surrounding the central supermassive black hole. However, the mechanism responsible for accelerating the parent protons to the required energies ($\\sim 100$ TeV) remains an open question. In this study, we investigate diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in active galactic nucleus (AGN) coronae using a suite of one-dimensional Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations spanning a broad range of plasma parameters. We find that DSA is a robust and efficient mechanism for proton acceleration, consistently channeling approximately 10\\% of the shock's kinetic energy into non-thermal ions, even for shocks with sonic Mach number as low as $ M_s \\approx 2$. In contrast, the efficiency of electron acceleration is highly variable and less efficient ($<1\\%$) in our parameter survey. These findings provide strong, first-principles support for the hadronic models of neutrino production in AGN and offer quantitative constraints that can explain the observed gamma-ray deficit.",

Coppejans, Domitilla de Martino, Simone Scaringi Submitted to the ESO Expanding Horizons Call for White Papers: Transforming Astronomy in the 2040s High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) What does the temporal evolution of disc winds tell us about accreting systems and the accretion process? Studies of accretion-disc outflows across all mass scales, including accreting white dwarfs, X-ray binaries, and active galactic nuclei, have shown that winds play a key role in regulating both the accretion flow and the surrounding environment. Disc winds therefore provide a common thread linking a broad range of scientific topics, from the microphysics of accretion to galaxy-scale feedback and evolution, as well as binary evolution and the predicted rates of energetic (multi-messenger) transient phenomena. Yet we still lack a comprehensive picture of the accretion-feedback process. Optical spectroscopy has revealed striking similarities across mass scales, hinting at common production mechanisms, and has shown that winds can evolve on timescales of only minutes. Progress, however, has been limited by their transient nature, sparse time coverage, and the lack of simultaneous, high-resolution spectroscopy. Time-domain facilities with high temporal and spectral resolution will allow us to track these events in high accretion-rate systems, constrain their launching mechanisms, and measure the mass, energy, and angular momentum they carry. This will provide crucial input for binary evolution models, wind feedback, and a unified view of accreting systems across mass scales.",

The recently observed Tayler-Spruit dynamo has been invoked to explain angular momentum transport in stellar radiative zones and magnetar formation in a proto-neutron star spun-up by fallback accretion. Whether this dynamo mechanism can lead to different dynamical regimes remains an open question. Using three-dimensional direct numerical simulations, we model the dynamics of a stably stratified spherical Couette flow, with the outer sphere rotating faster than the inner one. While the generation of strong stationary and hemispherical dynamos has been observed in our previous studies, we report for the first time the existence of reversals and complex temporal dynamics. We observe that the dynamics is strongly correlated with the equatorial symmetry breaking of the flow. Focusing on a fiducial dynamo simulation, we propose a simple interpretation of its dynamics, which consists in the coupling of two large-scale magnetic modes with two opposite equatorial symmetries by the flow symmetry breaking. While this interpretation captures the simplest observed dynamics, the nonlinear interaction between a higher number of magnetic modes is certainly required to describe some of the more complex regimes. The wide diversity of dynamical regimes generated by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo may have interesting implications for the geometry of the neutron star magnetic fields, and therefore neutron star emissions.",

Our selection yields a sample of 2372 sources, from which we construct a gold sample of 7 sources that have relatively well-constrained astrometry and confident optical counterparts.

A lot of recent studies have focused on the observables associated with near merger binary black-holes (BBHs) embedded in a circumbinary disk (CBD) but we still we lack knowledge of observables of BBHs in their early stage. In that stage the separation between the two black holes is so large that both black holes could potentially retain their individual accretion disk existing before the creation of the BBH. For such early BBH systems, it is interesting to look for observables originating in those individual disks whose structure is likely to differ from mini-disks often observed in simulations of later stages of BBHs. Aims. In a companion paper we presented a set of hydrodynamical simulations of an individual disk surrounding a primary black hole while being impacted by the presence of a secondary black-hole in an early BBH system, leading to the creation of three well-known characteristic features in the disk's structure. Here we explore the imprints of these three features on the observables associated with the thermal emission of the pre-existing black hole disk. The aim is two-fold, first to see which observables are best suited for detecting those early systems and, secondly, what could be extrapolated about these systems from observations. Methods. We used general relativistic ray-tracing in order to produce synthetic observations of the thermal emission emitted by early BBHs with different mass ratio and separations in order to search for distinctive observational features of early systems. Results. We found that in the case of early BBH with pre-existing disk(s) a necessary, although not unique, observational feature is the truncation of their disk(s). Conclusions. Such observable could be used for automated search of potential BBHs and discriminate some existing candidates.",

This finding has motivated the search for nearby neutron stars in the Solar neighborhood. In a recent study, a candidate for one of the closest neutron stars to Earth, LAMOST J235456.73+335625.9 (hereafter J2354), was reported. Based on dynamical mass measurements under different inclination angle assumptions, the inferred mass range for the unseen compact companion in the system is $1.4$--$1.6$ $M_{\\odot}$. Hence, the unseen companion in J2354 is either a massive cold white dwarf or a neutron star. Here we model the flux variations of J2354 as a combination of ellipsoidal modulation and surface spots. We test both cold spot and hot spot models, setting the number of spots to two in each case, and constrain the spot properties through light curve fitting. In the cold spot scenario, the spots are mostly visible at phases $0.5$--$0.75$, whereas in the hot spot scenario, the spots appear predominantly at phases $0.25$--$0.5$. The hot spot model shows better agreement with the observed H$\\alpha$ phase variation than the cold spot model. Furthermore, the thermal radiation of a massive but cold white dwarf cannot produce the level of localized heating required to explain the hot spot unless additional heating mechanisms are involved; in contrast, a neutron star can naturally provide such heating through energetic winds. Our results are consistent with the neutron star interpretation of the compact object in J2354.",

In a previous paper, we analyzed the NuSTAR observations of six X-ray binaries to obtain constraints on the deformation parameter $\\alpha_{13}$ using a state-of-the-art relativistic model. In this work, we continue analyzing NuSTAR observations of four more X-ray Binaries; two of which, namely Swift~J174540.7--290015 and Swift~J174540.2--290037 are X-ray Transients very close to the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy. The other two sources have complicated absorption, which is accounted for by time- and flux-resolved spectroscopy. The observation of MAXI J1631-479 is divided into two parts to account for the sudden increase in flux. The V404 Cygni spectra, obtained by combining two consecutive observations, are divided into 5 flux states and also account for absorption by quantifying the excess flux in the energy range of 6.5-7.0 keV. The constraints obtained are consistent with the Kerr hypothesis and are comparable with those obtained in previous studies and those from gravitational events. This work shows that even highly absorbed sources can be used for testing the Kerr hypothesis, which is possible with careful data reduction and subsequent data analysis.",

This work focuses on Wolf-Rayet stars as progenitors. The magnetic field amplification in the free wind region (shock upstream region) is not considered in this work. Test particle simulations show that particles escaped from the core-collapse SNR reach and move along the WTS, and eventually return to the SNR shock from the poles or equator of the WTS. The particle attainable energy can be boosted by this cyclic motion between the SNR shock and WTS and can be larger than the particle energy that is limited by escape from the SNR shock. The particle energy limited by the cyclic motion between the SNR shock and WTS is about $10-100~{\\rm TeV}$.

However, pulse profile models have often required an unwieldy number of parameters to account for complex surface emission geometries, introducing the risk of overfitting and degeneracies. To explore the number of model parameters that can be inferred uniquely, we perform a quantitative assessment of the information content in X-ray pulse profiles by applying Fourier methods. We determine the number of independent observables that can be reliably extracted from the pulse shapes, as well as from complementary X-ray spectral data obtained with XMM-Newton, for key NICER targets. Our analysis provides a framework for evaluating the match between model complexity and data constraints. It also demonstrates the importance of incorporating in the model the pulsed components of the magnetospheric non-thermal emission, which may often contribute significantly to the observed spectra. Our results highlight limitations in previous inferences of neutron-star radii from NICER observations, which may have incorporated model complexity not supported by the data.",

Accepted for publication in A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs) are rare extragalactic events of unknown origin. Tidal disruptions of white dwarfs by intermediate mass black holes (BHs), mergers of BHs and Wolf-Rayet stars, and failed supernovae are among the suggestions. We explore the viability of very massive star core-collapse events as the origin of LFBOTs. The appeal of such a model is that the formation of massive BHs via core collapse may yield observational signatures that can match the disparate lines of evidence that point towards both core-collapse and tidal disruption origins. We explore the formation rate of massive BH in population synthesis models, and compare the metallicities of their progenitors with the observed metallicities of LFBOT host galaxies. We further examine the composition, mass loss rates and fallback masses of these stars, placing them in the context of LFBOT observations. The formation rate of BHs with mass greater than ~30-40Msol is similar to the observed LFBOT rate. The stars producing these BHs are biased to low metallicity (Z<0.3Zsol), are H and He-poor and have dense circumstellar media. However, some LFBOTs have host galaxies with higher metallicities than predicted, and others have denser environments (plausibly due to late mass loss not captured in the models). We find that long-lived emission from an accretion disc (as implicated in the LFBOT AT 2018cow) can only be produce in these events under maximal disc mass and angular momentum conditions. We conclude that (very) massive star core-collapse is a plausible explanation for at least some LFBOTs, but faces challenges. The preferred progenitors for LFBOTs in the failed supernova interpretation overlap with those predicted to produce super-kilonovae. We therefore suggest that LFBOTs are promising targets to search for super-kilonovae, and that they may contribute to the r-process enrichment of galaxies.",

Rastinejad 15 pages, 4 figures, Accepted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) In addition to a $\\gamma$-ray burst (GRB), the merger of two neutron stars may produce a temporarily or indefinitely stable neutron star remnant with a strong magnetic field (a \"magnetar\"). As this magnetar remnant spins down, it can deposit its rotational energy into the surrounding kilonova ejecta, producing synchrotron emission that peaks in the radio bands $\\sim$months-years after the merger (\"boosted kilonova\"). The nearby ($z=0.0763$) long-duration GRB 211211A, which has an apparent kilonova counterpart and likely neutron star merger progenitor, may have produced such a remnant. We observed the location of GRB 211211A at 6 GHz with the NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) spanning $\\approx 0.54$-$1.7~$years after the burst. We do not detect any radio emission, placing strong limits on the energy deposited into the ejecta by any remnant to $\\lesssim 4.4 \\times 10^{52}~{\\rm erg}$. Due to the proximity of the event, we are also able to place limits on a kilonova afterglow that did not receive any additional energy deposition, though it is possible such emission will be suppressed until $\\sim 4~{\\rm years}$ after the burst, when the kilonova is expected to overtake the forward shock of the GRB. Future observations with the VLA and next-generation radio facilities will be able to further constrain the magnetar-boosted kilonova and kilonova afterglow scenarios, as well as directly constrain models in the scenario that GRB 211211A was instead produced by a collapsar.",

Extending the pulse width range of the FRB search by 3 orders of magnitude, the NSFRB search is sensitive to the recently-discovered Galactic Long Period Radio Transients (LPRTs or LPTs). The NSFRB search operates in real-time, utilizing a custom GPU-accelerated search code, \\texttt{cerberus}, implemented in Python with JAX. We summarize successful commissioning sensitivity tests with continuum sources and pulsar B0329+54, estimating the 90% completeness $25\\sigma$ flux (fluence) limit to be ~1200mJy (~160Jy ms). Future tests of recovery of longer timescale transients, e.g. CHIME J1634+44, are planned to supplement injection testing and B0329+54 observations. An offline DSA-110 NSFRB Galactic Plane Survey was conducted to search for LPRTs, covering $-3.5^\\circ<b<5.7^\\circ$ and $141^\\circ<l<225^\\circ$ (~770 square degrees) in Galactic coordinates. We estimate an upper limit Poissonian burst rate ~2 hr$^{-1}$ per square degree (~17 hr$^{-1}$} per $3^\\circ\\times3^\\circ$ survey grid cell) maximized across the inner $|b|<0.25^\\circ$ of the surveyed region. By imposing the ~1200mJy flux limit on two representative models (the magnetar plastic flow model and the White Dwarf-M Dwarf binary model), we reject with 95% confidence the presence of White Dwarf-M Dwarf binary LPRTs (beamed in a detectable direction) with periods between ~10-50s within ~95% of the surveyed region. Combined with the prevalence of LPRTs in the Galactic Plane, our results motivate further consideration of both White Dwarf-M Dwarf binary models and isolated magnetar models. We will continue to explore novel LPRT search strategies during real-time operations, such as triggered periodicity searches and additional targeted surveys.",

Dewangan 25 pages, 8 figures and 7 tables, Accepted for publication in the Journal of High Energy Astrophysics High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We report on the results obtained by the analysis of persistent and type-I thermonuclear X-ray burst emission observed from the periodic burster 4U 1323-62. These analyses are based on the NuSTAR observation performed on 2024 August 7 for a total exposure of around 90 ks. The persistent emission is well described by an absorbed thermal Comptonization model. An absorption edge is also detected at an energy of approximately 7.42 keV, which indicates the presence of absorbing material in the vicinity of this system. Six bursts have been observed during this observation, wherein we find the burst recurrence time to be approximately 4.52 hr. All the bursts exhibit the characteristics of a sharp rise and exponential decay. We perform the time-resolved spectroscopy of the burst spectra described by a model consisting of thermal emission from the neutron star surface and a varying persistent emission component to study the evolution of burst parameters. The enhancement of the persistent emission during burst exposure is characterized by the scaling parameter f a, which reflects the increasing strength of the burst-disc interaction with burst intensity, likely driven by Poynting-Robertson drag. The spectral analysis of bursts estimate the average apparent blackbody emitting radius of the neutron star to lie within 1.5-3.5 km. The ignition depths computed from the burst parameters indicate short Type-I thermonuclear bursts from a mixed hydrogen-helium fuel layer.",

A 113, 013307 (2026) Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th) The Gross-Pitaevskii equation is widely used for vortex dynamics, but finite domains with hard walls or confining potentials distort bulk behavior through vortex-image effects or induced flows. Periodic boundaries reduce wall artifacts yet cannot realize finite net vorticity because of topological obstruction, so bulk simulations with non-zero circulation are typically unavailable. Hence, we impose quasi-periodic boundary conditions that keep the superfluid's density periodic while enforcing phase windings consistent with a net prescribed total vorticity. This setting conserves the net number of vortices and enables long-time tracking of vortex trajectories in settings that finite containers cannot capture. This allows us to study vortex depinning and nucleation leading to the creation of Kármán vortex streets and perfectly periodic vortex arrays. The framework also provides a toy model for studying vortex dynamics in the bulk of neutron stars, free of possible limitations induced by confining potentials.",

Submitted to ApJ, comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The SMC orbits within the LMC's dark matter (DM) halo in a $\\sim$1:10 mass-ratio encounter. The LMC:Milky Way (MW) interaction is also $\\sim$1:10, and is expected to perturb the MW's DM distribution. However, no framework exists to quantify the severity of these perturbations over multiple pericenters and longer periods of time, such as the LMC-SMC interaction history. We construct basis function expansions of a high-resolution N-body simulation of the Clouds interacting in isolation and analyze their DM distributions at an epoch approximating the time of infall to the MW. Our goal is to quantify how the Clouds distort each other's DM distributions without the MW. The LMC halo's response to the SMC includes a $\\sim 20$ kpc-long dynamical friction wake and the displacement of the LMC's density center during each SMC pericenter, which produces two overdensities in the LMC halo (at $\\sim$60 and $\\sim$100 kpc) at MW infall. The SMC's tidal radius at infall is just $\\sim4$ kpc, at which point the SMC has lost two-thirds of its initial DM mass to the LMC. The distortions to the Clouds' halos produce a highly asymmetric acceleration field. Accurate orbit integration in the LMC-SMC system must account for the time-dependent shapes of both halos. The SMC-induced perturbations in the LMC DM halo resemble the MW-LMC system, and persist over multiple SMC pericenters. We conclude that 1:10 satellite:host encounters induce characteristic deformations in both DM halos across all host mass scales, with implications for merger rates and tests of DM models.",

Faisst, Claude-André Faucher-Giguère, Adam Lidz 26 pages, 16 figures, 1 table; submitted to ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Recent ALMA observations reveal diffuse [CII] emission (``[CII] halos\") extending to $\\sim 10\\,$kpc in galaxies at $4 < z < 6$. These measurements provide new insights into high-redshift galactic ecosystems and processes that drive metal enrichment on circumgalactic scales. To better understand the nature of [CII] halos, we analyze a suite of high-redshift FIRE-2 simulations at $5 \\leq z \\leq 6$ in the stellar mass range of $10^{9}$--$10^{10.5}\\,M_{\\odot}$. By post-processing these simulations with three-dimensional dust radiative transfer and photoionization modeling, we generate synthetic images of [CII] and UV continuum emission, from which we extract one-dimensional surface brightness profiles. Our results reproduce both the galaxy-integrated and spatial distribution of [CII] and UV emission, capturing in particular the more extended profile of [CII] emission. Comparing the time evolution of [CII] halos with bursty star formation histories of the simulated galaxies, we find that [CII] emission becomes more spatially extended following the decline of star formation rate in recent starburst episodes. This implies a strong correlation between extended [CII] emission and bursty star formation, consistent with a key role for star formation-driven outflows in producing [CII] halos -- though the kinematics of [CII]-emitting gas suggest that inflows and turbulent motions are also significant contributors. We also find a modest contribution from satellite galaxies to extended [CII] emission. Our framework can be readily applied to predict the observability of [CII] halos at higher redshifts and extended to create spatially resolved synthetic observations of other important emission lines, such as [OIII] and H$\\alpha$.",

The quiescent galaxy GS10578 at z=3.1 is a key example of this population. Previous JWST/NIRSpec IFU data revealed an AGN outflow and uncovered a compact pair of AGN separated by ~5 kpc. In addition, VLT/MUSE spectroscopy has identified a third AGN candidate at a projected distance of ~30 kpc, associated with a luminous Lya emitter (LAE2) characterised by high-ionisation UV lines, although rest-frame optical diagnostics were not previously available. We aim to confirm the nature of LAE2 using rest-frame optical diagnostics enabled by new JWST data, and to characterise the physical and ionisation properties of both LAE2 and a distinct nearby Lya emitter (LAE1) that lacks any detectable continuum counterpart. We analyse new NIRSpec IFU observations targeting the optical nebular lines of LAE1 and LAE2, complemented with MUSE data, as part of the GA-NIFS project. We extract integrated and spatially resolved spectra, construct emission-line maps, and use standard diagnostic diagrams to determine ionisation sources and kinematics. LAE2 exhibits line ratios fully consistent with an embedded AGN. Its optical lines display a clumpy morphology and irregular kinematics on sub-kpc scales. Except for Lya, LAE1 remains undetected in all nebular lines and in JWST imaging. The similarity of the LAE1 and LAE2 Lya profiles in both velocity and flux suggests that LAE1 traces resonantly scattered emission rather than in-situ star formation. Our analysis reveals that the environment of GS10578 contains both multi-black-hole activity and gas structures on tens-of-kpc scales, offering new insights into how feedback and satellite interactions influence the late evolutionary stages of quenched massive galaxies.",

The local (<200 pc away) young (<50 Myr old) stellar associations (LYSA) provide fundamental evidence for the study of the star formation process in the local neighbourhood. Aims. We aim at exploring robust statistical correlations in the internal kinematics of LYSAs and of these with age. Methods. We analyse a public data set containing the linear velocity field parameters and expansion ages of 18 LYSAs. We identify the most robust correlations using frequentist and Bayesian methods. Results. Among the 45 correlations, we identify only four that passed both frequentist and Bayesian criteria, with these four related to radial motions in the Galactic Z direction. We hypothesise several origins for these four correlations and identify the gravitational potential of the Galactic disk as the most likely driving element. It imprinted the observed motions in the parent molecular clouds, and once the stars were formed, it also damped these motions on a timescale shorter than the LYSAs' ages. Conclusions. The internal kinematics of local young stellar associations contain fundamental information about the star-formation process that is not fully addressed by star-formation theories, in particular, rotation and shear. Although the Galactic potential appears to be the driving force of these correlations, we urge the theoretical community to provide predictions about the internal motions of expansion, rotation, and shear of stellar associations.",

Using wide-field imaging data from the DESI Legacy Survey combined with a color-magnitude matched-filter technique, we perform a systematic analysis of extra-tidal features in 28 Galactic globular clusters of likely extragalactic origin, representing the largest homogeneous sample examined in this context to date. The clusters display diverse morphologies: 12 exhibit tidal tails, 9 show diffuse envelopes, and 7 reveal no clear extra-tidal features. Notably, we report the first detection of an extended tidal structure around the Sagittarius-associated cluster Terzan 7. To explore the underlying drivers, we compare intrinsic properties, orbital dynamics, and possible accretion associations across morphological groups. From the parameter distributions, complemented by Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, we find that total mass, escape velocity, concentration, tidal filling factor, pericentric radius, eccentricity and radial angle in action-angle coordinates are all likely group-sensitive parameters. These results suggest that both internal cluster properties and orbital configurations play important roles in shaping extra-tidal morphologies. In addition, the cluster's accretion history shows no clear correlation with the presence of tidal features, indicating that it is not a direct driver of outer structure formation. Overall, the diversity of tidal structures is unlikely to be governed by a single factor, but instead reflects the interplay between internal dynamical evolution and the external Galactic environment. This study provides the most comprehensive constraints so far on the physical processes driving extra-tidal structures in accreted globular clusters.",

However, their behaviour in the highly compressible regimes characteristic of the interstellar medium (ISM) remains incompletely understood. Using high-resolution 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of supersonic turbulence with rms Mach number $\\mathcal{M}_{\\rm rms} \\approx 11$, we explore fluctuation dynamos across magnetic Prandtl numbers ${\\rm Pm} = 1-10$. At ${\\rm Pm} = 1$, dynamo growth is slower and saturates at lower magnetic-to-kinetic energy ratios, with amplification in the kinematic phase dominated by compression rather than line stretching. In contrast, at ${\\rm Pm} = 10$, vortical stretching emerges as the dominant mechanism, yielding faster growth, higher saturation levels, and stronger suppression of density-magnetic field correlations by magnetic pressure. This transition is reflected in the correlation coefficient between density and magnetic field strength, which is strongly positive at ${\\rm Pm} = 1$ but decreases significantly at higher ${\\rm Pm}$. Across all runs, the ratio of velocity-to-magnetic integral scales is $\\sim 3.4$, independent of ${\\rm Pm}$, while the ratio of viscous to resistive dissipation scales increase with the increase in ${\\rm Pm}$. Synthetic Faraday rotation measures (RM) reveal coherence lengths of $\\sim (1/4-1/3)$ of the forcing scale across the range of ${\\rm Pm}$ explored. Using these coherence scales, we discuss the potential contribution of fluctuation dynamos to Faraday rotation expected from turbulent, gas rich young disk galaxies.",

Complex physical processes, including supernova (SN) explosions, shear, and gravitational collapse, drive and maintain turbulence, but it is still an open question what turbulence driving mode is primarily excited by these different mechanisms. The turbulence driving parameter, b, can be used to quantify the ratio of solenoidal to compressive modes in the acceleration field that drives the turbulence. Compressive driving is characterised by b ~ 1, while purely solenoidal driving gives b ~ 0.3. To quantify the turbulence in the galactic ISM, we investigate the time evolution of b, as well as the turbulent Mach number, and plasma beta (thermal-to-magnetic pressure ratio), and its correlation with star formation in the magnetised warm neutral medium (WNM) of the TIGRESS shearing-box simulations of a kpc-sized patch of a Milky-Way-like galaxy, over a 100 Myr time period (~ half an orbital time). In this simulation the turbulence is driven by a combination of shear, gravitational collapse, and star formation feedback in the form of radiation and SNe. We find that the turbulence driving parameter fluctuates in time between b ~ 0.4 and b ~ 1. We find a time-dependent correlation of b with star formation activity, such that high star formation rates follow about one turbulent turnover time (~ 10 Myr) after phases of highly compressive driving (b > 0.5). About 20 Myr after the peak in star formation, type-B SN feedback drives up the WNM fraction and turbulent Mach numbers, and reduces plasma beta and the driving to b ~ 0.4-0.5.",

Where possible analytical methods are therefore to be preferred. We provide an analytical tool to derive the optical properties of mantled spheroidal particles, of arbitrary axis ratio, in the long wavelength limit (a << lambda), where the mantle form may be confocal, co-axial or of constant depth with respect to the particle core. We have developed an analytical approach to spheroidal core/mantle particle optical property calculations. The analytical method compares well with DDSCAT numerical calculations and, under limited circumstances, with those made using the Bruggemann effective medium theory (EMT).The analytical method presented here provides a useful tool to explore the optical and polarisation properties of core/mantle spheroidal particles at long wavelengths (lambda >~ 8mu) and is simpler and faster to implement than corresponding numerical methods. We caution against the use of EMT methods in approximating the optical properties of core/mantle particles.",

      "abstract": "The effects of star-gas interactions on binary evolution in open clusters Jixuan Yang, Lile Wang, Xinyu Li, Meng Sun, Rainer Spurzem Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Star-gas interactions can provide gravitational feedback that influences the dynamical evolution of stellar clusters, through processes such as dynamical friction (DF) and its non-dissipative counterpart, negative dynamical friction (NDF). Using the \\texttt{PeTar} code, we perform direct $N$-body simulations of an open cluster initially containing $10^4$ stars, evolving within a gaseous medium spanning a range of ambient densities. Our results demonstrate that NDF associated with stellar outflows interacting with the surrounding gas can enhance the rate of cluster expansion, preferentially transporting stars toward the cluster outskirts. This behavior is accompanied by a more rapid decline in the number of binaries composed of a neutron star and a main-sequence star. A statistical analysis of binary orbital parameters further indicates that, compared to DF-dominated evolution, NDF tends to retain systems with larger semi-major axes and lower eccentricities. Outflow-ambient gas interactions can modify the dynamical processing of binaries in star clusters, leading to changes in the survival fraction and composition of the remaining binary population.",

Our analysis reveals that galaxies at $z = 10.6$ reside in dark matter halos over an order of magnitude less massive ($M_{\\rm{h}} \\sim 10^{10.12} M_{\\odot}$) than their counterparts at $z = 5.5$ ($M_{\\rm{h}} \\sim 10^{11.45} M_{\\odot}$), while exhibiting correspondingly higher effective bias values ($b_{\\rm{g}}^{\\rm{eff}} = 8.13^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ compared to $5.64^{+0.10}_{-0.13}$). Correspondingly, the satellite galaxy fraction hints at a declining trend with decreasing redshift, reaching $<1\\%$ by $z \\sim 5-6$. However, the significant systematic and random uncertainties in the data-model comparison prevent us from drawing robust conclusions on the evolution - if any - of the satellite fraction during the epoch of reionization.

Shapley 10 pages, 7 figures, 1 table + Appendix. submitted to A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present the spectroscopic confirmation and in-depth analysis of AURORA-LQG1, a low-mass quiescent galaxy at $z_{\\rm spec}=2.0834$ with $\\log(M_\\star/M_\\odot)=9.6$ observed with medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy. The deep medium-resolution spectrum enables the measurement of its stellar velocity dispersion ($\\sigma_\\star = 95_{-33}^{+38}\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$), the smallest value recorded among spectroscopically confirmed quiescent galaxies at $z\\sim2$. Coupled with a compact size ($0.41\\pm0.03\\, {\\rm kpc}$), it yields a dynamical mass estimate of $\\log(M_{\\rm dyn}/M_\\odot)=9.75_{-0.38}^{+0.29}$. Its star formation history suggests that half of the stellar mass was in place $\\sim1\\,{\\rm Gyr}$ before the observed epoch, with quenching occurring $\\sim0.2\\,{\\rm Gyr}$ prior to $z=2.08$. These results confirm that AURORA-LQG1 is genuinely quenched, rather than in a temporary phase of suppressed star formation rate. AURORA-LQG1 is consistent with the mass fundamental plane at $z\\sim2$, previously constrained only by massive quiescent systems. Compared with more massive counterparts at the same epoch observed with NIRSpec grating spectroscopy, the time since quenching for AURORA-LQG1 is among the shortest observed. The galaxy resides in a possible dense group-scale ($\\sim50$ kpc) environment containing one companion with tentative spectroscopic redshift and five companion candidates, and it is embedded in a known protocluster on Mpc scales. A potential environmental influence on its evolution could explain the outside-in quenching suggested by the positive gradient of size with wavelength. This study demonstrates that deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy enables low-mass quiescent galaxies at Cosmic Noon to be characterized with a level of detail long reserved for massive systems, offering valuable new insights into how quenching operates in these underexplored low-mass systems.

Pandian, Y. Gong, I. Barlach Christensen, K. M. Menten 21 pages, 18 figures, Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We aim to constrain the kinetic temperature and H$_2$ volume density of massive star-forming clumps associated with HII regions using multiple para-H$_2$CO transitions. In addition, we investigate the interplay between ionized gas, molecular gas, and dust to probe how massive stars influence their parental clumps. We observed the $J_{K_aK_c}$ transitions of para-H2CO (within its J = 3-2 and 4-3 states) with the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) 12 m submillimeter telescope using the nFLASH230 and SEPIA345 receivers towards a sample of 61 HII regions. Spectral line parameters are derived via multi-component Gaussian fitting, which was then used to constrain the physical conditions determined using PyRADEX, a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) radiative transfer code in combination with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. The non-LTE analysis yielded kinetic temperatures ($T_{kin}$) ranging from 33.7 K to 265 K and H2 densities (n(H$_2$)) between 0.8 X $10^4$ to 1.05 X $10^7$ cm$^{-3}$, providing a detailed characterization of the dense molecular gas contained in these clumps. In addition to the para-H$_2$CO emission arising from the targeted clump a large fraction (57%) of the sources exhibit multiple para-H$_2$CO components, with the secondary components being characterized by higher $T_{kin}$ and broader linewidths. Investigating the nature of the secondary component revealed its association with supersonic non-thermal motions and turbulent gas. When comparing the physical properties of the molecular gas and dust components with those of the ionizing gas, we find that parameters directly linked to the central high-mass star such as bolometric luminosity and Lyman continuum photon rate, show stronger and more systematic correlations.

Bower Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) AGN hosting water megamaser disks enable exceptionally precise geometric determinations of Black Hole (BH) mass, distance, inclination, and dynamical center. In anticipation of upcoming space-based very long baseline Interferometry (SVLBI) missions, megamaser disk AGN offer a uniquely valuable probe of strong-gravity regimes through black hole shadow (BHS) imaging beyond Sgr~A* and M87*. In this work, we (1) map the predicted BHS diameters of twenty-one of the most precisely characterized megamaser disk AGN to submillimeter-millimeter (submm-mm) interferometric baseline requirements, (2) estimate their respective AGN-core flux densities at submm-mm wavelengths, accounting for thermal-dust contamination, extended-jet emission, and intrinsic variability, and (3) determine the astrometric precision required to detect spin-dependent positional offsets between the BHS and the megamaser disk dynamical center. NGC~4258 stands out as the only megamaser disk AGN detectable on Earth-L2 baselines in the submm-mm regime, while other megamaser disk AGN in the sample would require baselines approaching Earth-L4/L5 distances; moreover, only a handful exhibit flux densities above $\\sim$10~mJy. Our results further indicate a submillimeter excess in NGC~4258, suggesting that the accretion disk remains thin down to a transitional radius of $\\lesssim 100$~Schwarzschild radii, within which the flow becomes advection dominated. For a maximally spinning supermassive black hole in NGC~4258, we show that the astrometric precision of the BHS centroid necessary to detect the BHS-dynamical center offset could, in principle, be achieved with Earth-Moon baselines; however, it would also demand astrometric precision of the water maser dynamical center roughly fifty times better than what is currently attainable.",

Panamarev Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate the accretion of globular cluster stars on early cosmological timescales through detailed N-body simulations of theoretical GC models to assess the role of this mechanism in Milky Way-like galaxies. For the dynamical modelling, we used the updated parallel N-body code phi-GPU, including stellar evolution. We prepared three sets of GC models with different half-mass radii (r_hm), each consisting of 50 full N-body GC models, and integrated these models in an external, time-variable MW-like potential taken from the cosmological database IllustrisTNG-100. The simulations cover the time interval from -10 Gyr to -5 Gyr, enabling us to assess the rate of early stellar accretion onto the proto-NSC. We find that GC models with average orbital eccentricities of 0.4-0.5 and orbits oriented perpendicular to the galactic disc contribute most significantly to the mass of the proto-NSC formation. Accretion is especially efficient in the first billion years and in compact GC models with r_hm = 1 pc. In all sets, the dominant accreted stellar population consists of low-mass stars (~0.33 Msun). However, the accreted mass alone is insufficient to fully account for the current NSC mass. Based on our extended set of numerical simulations, we obtained an average lower limit of mass contribution (~6 percent) to the NSC from investigated GCs. The fraction of mass contribution from individual disrupted GCs can significantly vary from 0.1 percent up to 90 percent. Generally, we conclude that the GC stellar accretion channel alone might not be sufficient to ensure the present-day MW galaxy NSC mass budget.",

In contrast, the H$^{13}$CO$^+$ (1$-$0) emission appears more clumpy and localized. The non-thermal motion in the filament is predominantly subsonic to transonic. We detect 13 dense cores in NH$_2$D (1$_{11}-1_{01}$), three of which coincide with continuum peaks; virial analysis suggests most are gravitationally bound. Using a friend-of-friend algorithm, we identify 32, 34, and 22 velocity-coherent fibers from the CS, HCO$^+$, and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ data, respectively. Compared to fibers traced by CS and HCO$^+$, H$^{13}$CO$^+$ fibers are more frequently associated with NH$_2$D cold cores and exhibit higher average mass-per-unit-length values. Differences among CS, HCO$^+$, and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ emissions likely arise from variations in effective critical densities.

However, their dark matter halo properties (e.g., halo mass) are still uncertain due to their rarity and strong field-to-field variation. The One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey has discovered 103 and 112 LABs in the extended ($\\sim$9~\\sqdeg) COSMOS field at $z\\sim2.4$ and 3.1, respectively, enabling estimation of their bias and host halo masses through clustering analysis. We measure the angular auto-correlation functions (ACFs) of LABs and derive galaxy bias factors of $b$ = $4.0\\pm0.8$ and $3.8\\pm0.7$, corresponding to minimum halo masses of $2.8^{+3.0}_{-1.8}$ and $0.7^{+0.8}_{-0.5}\\times10^{12}~M_\\odot$ and median halo masses of $4.2^{+3.8}_{-2.5}$ and $1.1^{+1.1}_{-0.7}\\times10^{12}~M_\\odot$ at $z\\sim2.4$ and 3.1, respectively. LABs occupy $\\sim$11$^{+39}_{-8}$\\% and $\\sim$3$^{+9}_{-2}$\\% of all dark matter halos above these minimum halo masses. These findings suggest that LABs inhabit massive dark matter halos, likely tracing proto-group environments that evolve into present-day massive halos ($\\sim$10$^{13}~M_\\odot$), where massive elliptical galaxies or galaxy groups reside, by $z=0$.",

      "abstract": "Converging on the eccentricity of massive black hole binaries in galactic mergers Alessia Gualandris, Justin Read, Federica Fastidio, Julian Chan, Thibaut François, Nader Khonji, Walter Dehnen 10 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Binaries of supermassive black holes (MBHBs) represent the primary sources of the gravitational wave background (GWB) detectable by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). The eccentricity with which binaries form in galactic mergers is the key parameter determining their evolutionary timescale from pairing to coalescence. However, accurately determining the binary eccentricity at formation is difficult in simulations due to stochastic effects. We present a numerical study of the formation and evolution of MBHBs that are potential PTA sources. We simulate mergers of equal-mass galaxies on different initial orbits and follow the dynamics of the MBHBs through the hardening phase. We find that low-resolution simulations are affected by stochasticity due to torques from the stellar distribution acting at pericentre passages. The dispersion in binary eccentricity decreases with increasing central resolution, as expected for a Poisson process. We provide a fitting formula for the resolution requirement of an N-body simulation of MBHB formation and evolution as a function of the initial eccentricity of the merger, e0, and the required accuracy in the binary eccentricity, eb. We find that binaries experience a torque at first pericentre that is approximately independent of initial eccentricity, producing a general trend in which the binary eccentricity decreases above sufficiently large initial orbital eccentricities. While this behaviour is generic, the precise cross-over eccentricity (e0~0.97 in our models) and the sharpness of the drop-off depend on the galaxy initial conditions. We provide a fitting formula for eb(e0) that can be used in semi-analytical models to determine the merger timescales of MBHBs as well as the amplitude and slope of the GWB.",

PASSAGE is a JWST Cycle 1 Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) wide-field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) pure-parallel survey, obtaining near-infrared spectra of thousands of extragalactic sources. 15 out of 63 PASSAGE fields fall within the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) COSMOS footprint, of which 11 overlap with COSMOS-Web, a JWST treasury survey providing additional space-based photometry. We present our custom line-finding algorithm and visual inspection effort used to identify emission lines and derive the spectroscopic redshifts for line-emitting sources in PASSAGE. The line-finding algorithm identifies between ~200 and 950 line-emitting candidates per field, of which typically 47% were identified as true emission lines post visual inspection. We identify 2183 emission line sources at 0.08<z<4.7, 1896 of which have available COSMOS photometric redshifts. We find excellent redshift agreement between the COSMOS photometric redshifts and the PASSAGE spectroscopic redshifts for strong (S/N>5), multi-line emitting sources. This agreement weakens for PASSAGE single-line emitters with ambiguous identities. These single-line emitters are likely mis-identified around 18% of the time based on comparisons to photometric redshifts. We derive stellar masses using PASSAGE photometry and spectroscopic redshifts, in broad agreement with existing COSMOS-Web stellar masses, but with some discrepancy driven by redshift disagreements. We publicly release this spectroscopic redshift catalog, which will enable community-led science in prime extragalactic fields and serve as a crucial dataset for validating Euclid and Roman spectroscopy.",

McLeod, Kate Rowlands, Ryan L. Sanders, Dirk Scholte, Maya Skarbinski, Thomas M. Stanton 20 pages, 9 figures. Submitted to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate the presence and origin of neutral gas outflows and inflows in 13 post-starburst (PSB) and quiescent galaxies at redshifts 1.8 $\\leq$ z $\\leq$ 4.6, using JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy from the EXCELS survey. NaD absorption profiles reveal that 3 out of 13 exhibit blueshifted absorption indicative of outflows, and a further 2 objects show signs of inflowing gas. Outflow velocities range from $\\approx$ 300 - 1200 kms$^{-1}$, and we find gas flows are detected exclusively in objects that quenched $\\lt$ 600 Myr ago. This result holds when we include comparable objects from recent literature. We derive mass outflow rates over two orders of magnitude higher than current levels of star formation in our sample, indicating that the winds are unlikely to be driven by supernovae, and likely play a significant role in keeping the galaxies quenched. The majority of the outflow sample have anomalously high energy and momentum outflow rates compared to those predicted for current levels of star formation or AGN activity. We conclude that we are likely observing fossil outflows driven by previous, more luminous AGN activity which has since faded. We then compare with the EAGLE simulation to explore a potential 'outflow cycle', finding that our observations are consistent with a model in which z $\\sim$ 3 quiescent galaxies undergo short $\\simeq$ 5 Myr periods of AGN activity strong enough to drive outflows, which occur every $\\simeq$ 40 Myr on average. This AGN activity drives observable outflows that persist for up to $\\simeq$ 10 Myr after the AGN fades, followed by a $\\simeq$ 20 Myr lull, and a subsequent short inflow, which eventually re-ignites AGN activity, and the cycle repeats.",

Le Gouellec Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The unique Galactic Center non-thermal filaments (NTFs) have been a focus of investigations for over 40 years. The most prominent manifestation of the NTFs is a bundle of parallel filaments known as the Radio Arc. Radio polarimetric observations made with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 10 GHz have revealed an alternating magnetic field pattern in the Radio Arc that could either be a result of multiple field systems being encountered along the line of sight or an intrinsic feature of the Radio Arc. These VLA observations were not able to distinguish between these possibilities due to the large rotation measures encountered towards the source. We present ALMA 100 GHz observations of the Radio Arc that are not impacted by significant Faraday effects. The observations reported here represent both the first time that ALMA has been used to study the NTFs and the first time 100 GHz polarimetric observations have been conducted on the Radio Arc. We find a uniformly rotated magnetic field with respect to the NTF filament orientation, with the angle of rotation being constant along the length of each filament. However, we find a systematically different magnetic field orientation in different Radio Arc filaments. We use this field pattern to update our understanding of the line-of-sight structures local to the Radio Arc. We find that the magnetic field inferred from our ALMA observations is likely a result either of confusion from multiple magnetic field systems or because the polarization is centrally concentrated within the NTF filaments.",

Christopher Howk Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Understanding the thermodynamic properties of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) is key to uncovering the baryon cycle in galaxies. Here we present spatial and kinematic relationships between Mg II and O VI as representatives for low and high ion-bearing gas, in the cosmological zoom-in galaxy simulation suite FOGGIE, a set of Milky-way-like galaxy simulations with high CGM resolution. We find the O VI-bearing gas exists as a diffuse halo around the galactic disk, while the Mg II-bearing gas is more centrally located. We investigate the covering fraction, probability of co-observation, co-kinematic correspondence of these ions using two different analysis methods. We make both mock sightlines using two-dimensional projections of our simulations treating these cells as integrated lines of sight and we create one-dimensional ray objects and use the SALSA (Boyd et al. 2020) code to investigate individual gas structures that contribute most to the line of sight column densities, which we call mock absorbers. We explore the relative kinematics of these mock absorbers and find Mg II and O VI appear to have a co-kinematic relationship when looking at absorber pairs with the closest relative velocity like in Werk et al. (2016). However, this does not necessarily correspond with a close spatial separation meaning many O VI and Mg II absorber pairs only appear to be co-kinematic but are physically unrelated. Taking a more holistic look at Mg II and O VI absorber pairs reveals a much weaker correlation between these two ions.",

An integral field unit (IFU) in the ultraviolet on Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) could be used to quickly map extended objects like supernova remnants or galaxies and their surroundings, but there are technical challenges to an ultraviolet IFU. The INtegral Field Ultraviolet Spectrographic Experiment (INFUSE), a sounding rocket project, is the first static configuration far ultraviolet integral field spectrograph. INFUSE features an f/16, 0.49m Cassegrain telescope and a 26-element image slicer feeding 26 replica holographic gratings, with spectra imaged by the largest cross-strip microchannel plate detector flown in space. The first launch of INFUSE occurred from White Sands Missile Range on October 29th, 2023, and demonstrated spectral multiplexing, successfully detecting ionizing gas emission in the XA region of the Cygnus Loop. INFUSE will launch again in fall 2025 to observe NGC 2366, a local analog for Green Pea type galaxies, with several enhancements including a xenon-enhanced lithium fluoride + aluminum coated grating, testing the leading flight coating for HWO for the first time.

Aims: We introduce MAUI (Machine-learning Assisted Uncertainty Inference), a statistical framework designed for efficient Bayesian inference of stellar parameters using emulator-based spectral models. Methods: MAUI employs Gaussian-process-based emulators trained on a limited set of non-LTE simulations, combined with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to explore posterior distributions. We validate the approach with recovery experiments and demonstrate it on Galactic late-type O dwarf and early-type B dwarf/subgiant stars. Results: The emulator reproduces the predictions of full atmosphere models within quoted uncertainties while reducing computational cost by orders of magnitude. Posterior distributions are well calibrated, with conservative coverage across all stellar parameters. Conclusions: Emulator-driven Bayesian inference retains the accuracy of classical analyses at a fraction of the computational expense, enabling posterior sampling that would be prohibitive with direct model evaluations. This positions emulators as a practical tool for high-fidelity spectroscopy of massive stars as atmosphere models grow more demanding.",

The Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) has been used to conduct a medium-resolution spectroscopic survey of 697 helium-rich hot subdwarfs and related stars. Using 587 stars from the full SALT sample, we define an unsupervised data-led classification system based on Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Spectral Clustering (SC), designed as a data-discovery tool to identify possible new groups and sequences within the data. Using the first 3 principal components (PCs), we identify 6 major clusters of hot subdwarf spectra, identified with the traditional spectral classes of classical sdB and sdO stars, helium-rich He-sdO stars and very hot subdwarfs. Two clusters covering large volumes of PC space include a) He-sdB and He-sdOB stars and b) intermediate iHe-sdB and iHe-sdOB stars. Most spectra in these major clusters form connected sequences in PC space. Using a second stage of PCA and SC, we identify sub-clusters within 4 major clusters, particularly in the He-sdB/OB and iHe-sdB/OB clusters. In comparison with traditional MK-like classification, we find that the PC clusters are reasonably well separated, with some overlap at cluster boundaries. For very hot sdOs, where the number of standards is small, PC classification has led to a revision of the Drilling MK-like system. Gaia DR3 measurements have been used to determine kinematic parameters for the PC-defined classes. Although disk stars account for a significant fraction of all classes, He-sdOs and Hot-sdOs include a higher fraction of halo stars.",

Utilizing the JWST NIRCam wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS), we analyze emission line fluxes, star formation rates (SFRs), and spatially resolved flux distributions of 97 Pa$\\alpha$ emitters at $1<z<1.6$. To assess dust extinction within our sample, we combine Pa$\\alpha$ fluxes with archival H$\\alpha$ data taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 G141 grism. Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between dust extinction and galaxy stellar mass, where more massive galaxies exhibit greater dust extinction. We employ two-dimensional Pa$\\alpha$ and F444W mapping to trace the distributions of star formation and stellar mass, respectively. Our observations indicate that lower mass galaxies are almost dust free in Pa$\\alpha$ and exhibit smaller sizes both in star formation and underlying stellar continuum. In contrast, galaxies with a stellar mass greater than $10^{9.5}M_\\odot$ display diverse dust extinction and star formation patterns. This variation suggests that the structures and properties of massive galaxies evolve through different phases, which involve, e.g., star formation in massive clumps, compaction, and inside-out quenching. This study demonstrates the capabilities of JWST WFSS in conducting systematic investigations of emission line galaxies and highlights the pivotal role of Pa$\\alpha$ in advancing our understanding of dust extinction and obscured star formation in the early universe.",

Accepted version, published in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present new results on the rest-frame UV luminosity function (UVLF) and stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratio of bright (M$_{\\rm UV}\\lesssim-20$ mag) spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at $z=7-9$ derived from the BoRG-$JWST$ survey, a unique data set of NIRSpec prism follow up of $HST$-selected sources from random-pointing imaging. By selecting galaxies from over 200 independent sight lines, the survey minimizes cosmic variance ensuring a statistically robust sample of the bright-galaxy population during the epoch of reionization. The data is used to constrain, for the first time, the bright end of the UVLF at $z=7-9$ from spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies over eight independent fields. We find that the bright end of the UVLF is higher than found using imaging over $JWST$ legacy fields, suggesting the latter may be significantly affected by cosmic variance, and thus reducing the tension with recent findings from $JWST$ at $z>10$ and comparable to models invoking little dust attenuation and bursty star formation. Additionally, we use the galaxies' $JWST$ spectra to infer their stellar masses and M/L ratios relative to other $HST$ and $JWST$ studies. We show that the stellar mass scales almost linearly with UV luminosity (M$_* \\propto L_{\\rm UV}^{0.85\\pm0.12}$), albeit with large ($\\sim0.5$ dex) intrinsic scatter, consistent with stochastic bursts of star formation in early galaxy formation.",

We use archival DESI Legacy Survey imaging data and perform an extensive search for dwarf satellites, extending out to a radius of 150~kpc ($\\sim$$R_{vir}$). We identify 355 candidate satellite galaxies, including 264 new discoveries. Extensive tests with injected galaxies demonstrate that the survey is complete down to $M_V\\sim-$9.0 (assuming the distance of the host) and $\\mu_{0,V}\\sim$26 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ (assuming a n$=$1 Sérsic profile). We perform consistent photometry, via Sérsic profile fitting, on all candidates and have initiated a comprehensive follow-up campaign to confirm and characterize candidates. Through a systematic visual inspection campaign, we classify the top candidates as high-likelihood satellites. On average, we find 4.0$\\pm$1.4 high-likelihood candidate satellites per LMC-mass host and 2.1$\\pm$0.6 per SMC-mass host which is within the range predicted by cosmological models. We use this sample to establish upper and lower estimates on the satellite luminosity function of LMC/SMC-mass galaxies. ID-MAGE nearly triples the number of low-mass galaxies surveyed for satellites with well-characterized completeness limits, providing a unique dataset to explore small-scale structure and dwarf galaxy evolution around low-mass hosts in diverse environments.",

Published in ApJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) A systematic search for HI 21-cm absorption in Quasar-Galaxy Pairs (QGPs) provides a powerful means to map the distribution of cold gas around high-redshift star-forming galaxies. Fiber spectroscopy of high-redshift quasars enables the serendipitous detection of foreground star-forming galaxies at extremely small impact parameters, forming a unique subset of QGPs known as Galaxies On Top Of Quasars (GOTOQs). In this study, we present results from a pilot upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) survey of three GOTOQs, where we achieved a remarkable 100% detection rate of HI 21-cm absorption. By combining our findings with existing literature, we establish that GOTOQs constitute a distinct population in terms of HI 21-cm absorption, with significantly higher detection rates than those observed in Damped Lyman-$\\alpha$ (DLA)-based or metal absorption-based searches. For the GOTOQs, we find a strong correlation between the line-of-sight reddening and the HI 21-cm optical depth, characterized by $\\int \\tau\\, dv\\, (\\rm{km\\,s^{-1}}) = 13.58^{+2.75}_{-2.35} E(B-V) + 0.68^{+1.06}_{-1.27}$, consistent with the Milky Way sightlines. We also show that the HI 21-cm detection rates and optical depth declines rapidly with the impact parameter. With upcoming wide-field spectroscopic surveys expected to substantially expand the catalog of known GOTOQs, the success of this pilot survey lays the foundation for constructing a statistically significant sample of intervening HI 21-cm absorbers.",

Aaron Yung Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present AGNBoost, a machine learning framework utilizing XGBoostLSS to identify AGN and estimate redshifts from JWST NIRCam and MIRI photometry. AGNBoost constructs 66 input features from 7 NIRCam and 4 MIRI bands to predict the fraction of mid-IR $3$--$30\\,\\mu$m emission attributable to an AGN power law ($\\text{frac}_{\\text{AGN}}$) and photometric redshift. Each model is trained on $10^6$ simulated galaxies from CIGALE. Models are tested on mock CIGALE galaxies, an independent set of empirically-derived templates, and 748 observations from the JWST MIRI EGS Galaxy and AGN (MEGA) survey. On idealized noise-free mock CIGALE galaxies, AGNBoost achieves $15\\%$ outlier fractions of $1.63\\%$ ($\\text{frac}_{\\text{AGN}}$) and $0.15\\%$ (redshift), with $\\sigma_{\\text{RMSE}} = 0.045$ for $\\text{frac}_{\\text{AGN}}$ and $\\sigma_{\\text{NMAD}} = 0.004$ for redshift. When realistic photometric uncertainties are introduced, performance remains robust with median predictions on the 1:1 relation, though outlier fractions increase to $4.38\\%$ and $3.35\\%$, respectively. On the independent template set, AGNBoost identifies $92.6\\%$ of AGN candidates with $\\text{frac}_{\\text{AGN}} > 0.3$ and $100\\%$ with $\\text{frac}_{\\text{AGN}} > 0.5$, demonstrating generalization beyond the training distribution. On MEGA galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, AGNBoost achieves $\\sigma_{\\text{NMAD}} = 0.056$ and $19.79\\%$ outliers. AGNBoost $\\text{frac}_{\\text{AGN}}$ estimates broadly agree with CIGALE fitting ($\\sigma_{\\text{RMSE}} = 0.178$, $11.96\\%$ outliers). The flexible framework allows straightforward incorporation of additional photometric bands and re-training for other variables. AGNBoost's computational efficiency makes it well-suited for wide-sky surveys requiring rapid AGN identification and redshift estimation.",

Main revision in the black hole mass upper limits estimation (Section 4.2.1 and Figure 13). All data products and analysis codes to reproduce the work are available in this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of red and compact objects with a unique V-shape SED at z >= 4 known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Most of the LRDs with existing spectral observations exhibit broad Balmer lines and are thus likely to host active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we present a study of LRDs with no broad H-alpha component. Our sample consists of five LRDs at z~5 with H-alpha line widths of about 250 km/s. They are selected from 32 LRDs that have NIRSpec high- or medium-resolution grating spectra covering H-alpha. During our construction of the sample, we find that approximately 20 percent of the LRD candidates previously selected do not show red continuum emission but resemble the V-shape spectra due to strong line emission. Compared to normal star-forming galaxies, narrow-line LRDs tend to have relatively higher H-alpha line widths and luminosities. If these LRDs are dominated by galaxies, our SED modeling suggests that they are dusty, compact star-forming galaxies with high stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs). Alternatively, if their SEDs are produced by AGNs, the inferred central black hole masses (MBH) are in the range of 10^5 to 10^6 solar masses, placing them at the low-mass end of the AGN population. They may represent an early stage of super-Eddington growth, where the black holes have yet to accumulate significant masses. With large measurement uncertainties, these black holes appear slightly overmassive relative to the local MBH-Mstar relation, but consistent or undermassive with respect to the MBH-sigma and MBH-Mdyn relations. We further find that nearly half of the high-redshift broad-line AGNs exhibit V-shape SEDs. (abridged)",

Mann, Vivienne Wild Accepted for publication in MNRAS. Comments welcome. 15 pages, 8 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Galaxy mergers and interactions have long been suggested as a significant driver of galaxy evolution. However, the exact extent to which mergers enhance star formation and AGN activity has been challenging to establish observationally. In previous work, we visually classified a sample of galaxies with various types of faint tidal features in DECaLS images. In this paper, we cross-correlate this sample with a principal component analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey data to investigate how the presence of these features, as well as their specific nature, correlates with intense star formation and AGN activity. Averaged over all tidal classes, we find that tidal feature galaxies are 10.3$\\pm$1.5 times more likely to be in a starburst phase, and 24.3$\\pm$5.0 times more likely to have rapidly quenched (post-starbursts), than those in a mass-matched control sample. Examining differences between tidal classes, galaxies with \\textit{arm} features are 1.4$\\pm$0.2 times more likely to be starbursting than the other categories, while those with \\textit{shell} features are 2.7$\\pm$0.6 times more likely to be in a quiescent state. In a similar analysis, we identify which galaxies show evidence of AGN activity and find no significant difference between the fraction of those with or without tidal features. Overall, our results reinforce the notion that mergers play an important role in driving star formation and rapid quenching in galaxies, and provide some of the first empirical evidence that the strength of this effect has a dependence on the detailed nature of the interaction, as traced by the tidal feature morphology.",

These phenomena are intrinsically linked to the physical conditions of the medium, which is permeated by magnetic (B) fields affecting its transport and dynamics. Here, we spatially resolve, $0.24$\" (96 pc), the B-fields in the dusty and molecular outflows of Arp 220, the closest ($78$ Mpc) Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxy hosting two interacting nuclei, denoted as East and West. We perform ALMA $870~\\mu$m dust continuum polarization and CO(3-2) emission line polarization, and report the first detection of CO(3-2) emission line polarization through the Goldreich-Kylafis effect in an outflow. Dust polarization shows that Arp 220 E has a spiral-like B-field on the disk with a linear polarization fraction of $0.4\\pm0.1$% that may produce the detected circular polarization passing through foreground aligned dust grains. Arp 220 W reveals a B-field parallel to the red- and blueshifted outflows in both the dust and emission line polarization maps. The outflows show a dust polarization of $0.2$%, while the CO(3-2) emission line polarization is $1-2$% at $4-6\\sigma$ significance across independent velocity channels. A highly polarized ($3-5$%) dusty bridge has a B-field orientation of $\\sim110^{\\circ}$ connecting both nuclei. Mean B-field strengths of $1.6$ mG and $8$ mG for the blue- and redshifted outflows, respectively, are estimated. These strong B-fields are attributed to amplification by compression in nuclear clouds and supernova remnants. This amplified B-field is likely sustained by the turbulent kinetic energy in the outflow and may be critical in directing the transport of metals and cosmic rays into the circumgalactic medium.",

The short-lived, sporadic, and anisotropic nature of radio activities, coupled with the detection of abundant cold gas around some massive quiescent galaxies, raise questions about the efficiency of radio feedback in massive galaxies. Here we present an innovative method rooted in artificial intelligence to separate galaxies in which radio feedback is effective (RFE), regardless of current radio emission, from those in which radio feedback is ineffective (RFI), according to their optical images. Galaxies categorized as RFE are all dynamically hot, whereas quiescent RFI (RFI-Q) galaxies usually have extended cold-disk components. At given stellar mass, dark matter halos hosting RFE galaxies are between four to ten times more massive than those of RFI-Q galaxies. We find, for the first time, that almost all RFE galaxies have scant cold gas, irrespective of AGN activity. In contrast, many RFI-Q galaxies are surrounded by substantial amounts of condensed atomic gas, indicating a different evolutionary path from RFE galaxies. Our finding provides direct and compelling evidence that a radio AGN has gone through about 300 on-off cycles and that radio feedback can prevent gas cooling over a timescale much longer than that of radio activity. Contrary to general belief, our analysis shows that only a small fraction of massive galaxies are influenced by strong radio AGNs, suggesting that current galaxy formation models need serious revision.",

Observed SEDs are compared with theoretical models to characterize the central stars and their circumstellar dust envelopes and to estimate distances. For the LMC, a set of best-fitting CAGB models is derived by fitting observed SEDs with radiative transfer models, utilizing the galaxy's well-established distance. For Galactic CAGB stars, where Gaia DR3 parallaxes are uncertain, we estimate distances by fitting observed SEDs with the CAGB models validated against LMC stars, and for Mira variables, from the period-magnitude relation calibrated with LMC Miras. A comparison of these approaches demonstrates that the SED-based distances are both reliable and practical for a large sample of Galactic CAGB stars. We find that CAGB stars in both galaxies show broadly similar infrared properties, although the LMC sample lacks stars with extremely thick dust envelopes.",

Data at this https URL Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present JWST/NIRSpec high-cadence infrared spectroscopy of three long-period, eclipsing AM CVn binaries, Gaia14aae, SRGeJ0453, and ZTFJ1637. These systems have orbital periods of 50-62 minutes and cool donors that are undetectable in the optical. The data cover a wavelength range of 1.6-5.2 $\\mu$m at resolution $R=1000-2000$. We obtained 150-200 spectra of each system over two orbits, split between the G235M and G395M gratings. All three systems show strong, double-peaked He I emission lines dominated by an accretion disk. These lines are nearly stationary but contain radial velocity (RV) variable sub-components that trace stream-disk interactions. In Gaia14aae and SRGeJ0453, we detect two Na I doublets in emission whose RVs track the irradiated face of the donor, marking the first direct detection of the donors of long-period AM CVns. No absorption lines from the donors are detected, implying that the IR excesses observed in many long-period AM CVns primarily trace disks, not donors. The He I emission profiles in all systems lack high-velocity wings and show no emission beyond $\\approx 1500,\\rm km,s^{-1}$. The morphology of the disk eclipses and Doppler tomograms are best reproduced by models in which the disk is truncated well outside the white dwarf and only material at $r \\gtrsim 0.07,R_{\\odot}$ contributes to the disk emission. We interpret this as possible evidence of magnetized white dwarf accretors. For plausible mass transfer rates, the truncation radii imply surface magnetic fields of $B = 30-100$ kG, consistent with recent constraints based on X-ray periodicity. The absence of cyclotron humps out to 5 $\\mu$m rules out stronger MG-level fields. We make the data from the program publicly available to the community.",

Saleem Khan Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Context. Different modes of oscillations are frequently observed in solar prominences/filaments, and prominence seismology helps estimate important physical parameters like the magnetic field strength. Although the simultaneous detection of longitudinal and transverse oscillations in the same filament is not common, such rare observations provide a unique opportunity to constrain the physical parameters of interest. Aims. In this study, we aim to estimate the physical parameters of prominences undergoing simultaneous longitudinal and transverse oscillations. Methods. We apply Bayesian seismology techniques to observations of longitudinal and transverse filament oscillations to infer the magnetic field strength, the length, and the number of twists in the flux tube holding the prominence plasma. We first use the observations of longitudinal oscillations and the pendulum model to infer the posterior probability density for the magnetic field strength. The obtained marginal posterior of the magnetic field, combined with the observations of the transverse oscillations, is then used to estimate the probable values of the length of the magnetic flux tube that supports the filament material using Bayesian inference. This estimated length is used to compute the number of twists in the flux tube. Results. For the prominences under study, we find that the length of the flux tubes supporting the quiescent prominences can be very large (from 100 to 1000 Mm) and the number of twists in the flux tube are not more than three. Conclusions. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian analysis offers valuable methods to perform parameter inference in the context of prominence seismology.",

To understand what determines the timing of such a secondary peak in the H$\\alpha$ light curve associated with postflare loops, we must quantitatively identify the key physical processes controlling the appearance of H$\\alpha$ postflare loops. Previous case studies have indicated that the appearance timing of H$\\alpha$ postflare loops is likely governed by radiative cooling. However, the statistical characteristics of the timing of H$\\alpha$ postflare loops appearance remain insufficiently investigated. In this study, we statistically investigated the appearance timing of H$\\alpha$ postflare loops to quantify their cooling processes. As a result, we found a negative correlation between the time difference between the soft X-ray peak and the appearance of the H$\\alpha$ postflare loops ($\\Delta t$) and the soft X-ray peak flux ($F_\\mathrm{X}$). This relationship is consistent with the theoretical scaling between radiative cooling timescale ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}}$) and $F_\\mathrm{X}$, where $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}} \\propto~F_\\mathrm{X}^{-1/2}$. This statistical result indicates that the appearance timing of H$\\alpha$ postflare loops relative to the soft X-ray peak is primarily controlled by radiative cooling. Furthermore, we examined the dependence of the scaling law on flare spatial scales ($L$). Consequently, we demonstrated that spatial scale of unresolved stellar flares can be estimated using the following scaling law: $L\\propto F_\\mathrm{X}^{1/3}\\Delta t^{2/3}$. Our results are useful for interpreting secondary peaks in the H$\\alpha$ data of stellar flares and provide new method to estimate spatial scale of unresolved stellar flares.",

Starting in October 2019, Betelgeuse underwent a striking dimming event, fading from magnitude 0.5 to 1.7 by mid February 2020 a threefold decrease in brightness This gave rise to a number of speculative debates that the star was on the verge of a supernova, a moment of eerie quiet before the cosmic outburst. In a previous article, the author discussed the most accepted explanation to the dimming caused by episodic mass loss that released large dust grains, which obscured Betelgeuse's light and made it appear fainter. This interpretation suggested that the dimming was not a precursor to a supernova, as Betelgeuse is likely still far from reaching that stage. On 21 July 2025, the existence of the companion star was confirmed with direct imaging, for the first time, by the alopeke instrument on the 8.1 m Gemini North telescope. The companion is 6 magnitudes fainter than Betelgeuse and orbits close to Betelgeuse itself, within the supergiant star's extended outer atmosphere. The stellar companion was detected at an angular separation of 52 mas and a position angle of 115 deg east of north. These measurements, along with its brightness, being roughly 6 magnitudes fainter than Betelgeuse at 466 nm, are in excellent agreement with dynamical predictions. Although this was only a 1.5 sigma detection, the agreement in the companion's appearance, separation, position angle, magnitude difference, and estimated mass is reasonable, making the result tentatively acceptable. The next optimum period for observations is November 2027, when we hope to get better observations. This article describes the interesting twists and turns of this study and what lies in the future for Betelgeuse and its companion, Betelbuddy or Siwarha.",

However, in a matter of years it has faded, its pulsations have become suppressed and the spectrum has become dominated by emission lines from ionised gas, a far cry from the Mira-like pulsation and late M-type spectrum it used to display. Around the same time, a hot dust cloud was discovered using the VLT interferometer. WOH G64 has been claimed to have turned into a yellow hypergiant, which could signal a pre-supernova post-red supergiant evolution. Here we present spectra of WOH G64 obtained with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) between November 2024 and December 2025. Molecular absorption bands from TiO are seen at all times. This implies that WOH G64 is currently a red supergiant, and may never have ceased to be. However, the shallow, resolved bands and possible detection of VO hint at a highly extended atmosphere. The continuum appears to be varying, while the line emission shows a different behaviour, suggesting two separate components in the system. Meanwhile, atomic absorption lines are deepening. This places important constraints on scenarios for the dramatic events that are unfolding.",

This suggests the absence of one or several unidentified angular momentum transport processes in these models. Transport by large-scale and strong magnetic fields in the radiative zone is a promising candidate to explain the observations. While these fields may have a fossil origin, a dynamo driven by the Tayler instability in a shear flow constitute a primary mechanism to form the necessary magnetic fields. Despite recent numerical studies, this mechanism remains poorly known. Motivated by this, we investigate the Tayler-Spruit dynamo through a new set of three-dimensional direct numerical simulations. We model the radiative zone as a Boussinesq stably stratified fluid whose differential rotation is maintained by a volumetric body force. We report for the first time the existence of two bistable dynamo branches, which mainly differ by the magnetic field location (near the equator and the polar axis). While the equatorial branch is driven by the magnetorotational instability, we mainly investigate the newly identified polar branch, which is driven by the Tayler instability. We show that this branch can still operate and transport angular momentum efficiently in a very strong stratification regime. We extract new scaling laws for the different magnetic field components, transports processes, and the minimum shear to trigger the Tayler instability-driven dynamo. Finally, we roughly constrain the signature of the generated magnetic fields on asteroseismic modes propagating in main-sequence and evolved stars. Thus, our results fosters new studies using stellar evolution models including our prescriptions and the search of asteroseismic signals impacted by large-scale azimuthal magnetic fields.",

Hale, Emily J. Hatt, Eleanor Murray, Martin B. Nielsen Accepted for publication in MNRAS (9 pages, 7 figures) Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Frequencies of low-degree solar p modes are sensitive to activity over the entire Sun, including the unobservable far-side hemisphere. When frequency shifts extracted from week-long BiSON datasets are fitted to a linear combination of observed near-side activity and a far-side proxy made from the near-side measures shifted by half the solar rotation period, the solution favours a slightly higher weighting from the far-side contribution. Here, we demonstrate that this unphysical mismatch is due to the inherent inaccuracy of the far-side proxy, which fails to capture active regions that evolve fully on the solar far side, or that evolve (or have evolved) significantly as they rotate off (or onto) the visible disc. By simulating the evolution of sunspot group areas over time, which act as a suitable measure of solar activity, we show that the solution is sensitive to the lifetime of the activity. Assuming an underlying mapping from maximum group areas $A_{\\rm max}$ (measured in millionths of the solar hemispheric area, MSH) to group lifetimes $\\tau$ (measured in days) of the form $\\tau = \\alpha A_{\\rm max}$, we find that $\\alpha \\simeq 0.025^{+0.055}_{-0.016}\\,\\rm d\\,MSH^{-1}$ gives results consistent with the BiSON finding. This is to be compared with the value of $\\alpha = 0.1\\,\\rm d\\,MSH^{-1}$ implied by the well-known Gnevyshev-Waldmeier rule. While our best-fitting $\\alpha$ maps to an average group lifetime of $\\tau \\simeq 5^{+10}_{-3}\\,\\rm d$, the best-fitting distribution includes a reasonable fraction of groups with lifetimes longer than the solar rotation period, which is essential to reproducing the mismatch.",

However, little work has been done to study the effects of spatial resolution on the dynamical processes occurring in the Sun's atmosphere. In this work, owing to the availability of high-resolution observations of a magnetic pore captured with the Interferometric BIdimensional Spectrometer mounted at the Dunn Solar Telescope, we studied the impact of the diffraction limit and the sampling of an instrument on line-of-sight Doppler velocity oscillations. We reported a noticeable shift in the dominant frequency band from $5$ to $3$ mHz, as both the angular and detector resolutions of the instruments were degraded. We argue that the observed behaviour is a result of the increased contamination of straylight from neighbouring quiet Sun regions, masking the true behaviour of umbral oscillations. These results suggest that the wave energy contributions reported in the literature and based on low-resolution instrumentation may be fundamentally underestimated. As we move into the era of high-resolution instrumentation such as DKIST and MUSE, this work will offer a critical baseline for interpreting new observations, especially in terms of distinguishing true dynamic behaviours from artefacts introduced by instrument-related limitations.",

Udnæs, Tiago M.D. Pereira 11 pages, 8 figures, plus appendices, accepted for publication in A&A, abstract shortened for Arxiv Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Chromospheric heating is an important ingredient in the energy budget of the solar atmosphere, which is challenging to quantify from observations. By using 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar atmosphere combined with non-LTE spectral synthesis, we estimated chromospheric heating from synthetic spectra and studied the spectral and temporal signatures of heating events. We performed k-means clustering on the Mg II h, Ca II H, and Ca II 8542 Å lines to identify representative profiles associated with elevated chromospheric heating and studied their atmospheric stratification. We find that locations with the strongest chromospheric heating show spectral signatures with strong emission. Profiles with strong emission in the blue wing of the lines (blue grains) are created by upward-propagating shock waves and have an order of magnitude higher heating in the chromosphere than the ambient heating. Profiles with strong emission in the red wing (red grains) also display heating that is an order of magnitude stronger than the baseline, but these spectra do not show a characteristic atmospheric stratification. Spectra classified as blue grains have a consistent temporal evolution, which is an oscillating sawtooth pattern in the line core and emission in the blue wing. However, spectra classified as red grains did not show a consistent temporal signature: Red wing emission from the simulations can appear spontaneously or be associated with an oscillation. While red and blue grain profiles account for around 3% of our synthetic spectra, they account for more than 12% of the total chromospheric heating in these simulations. By comparing two quiet Sun simulations, we find that the prevalence of bright grains is influenced by the magnetic field configuration, with a unipolar configuration showing fewer bright grains and consequently a lower share of heating from such events.",

Elms 21 pages, 10 figures, accepted in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present a quantitative spectroscopic and kinematic analysis of a volume-complete sample of hot subluminous stars within 500 pc of the Sun, assembled using accurate parallax measurements from Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3). In total, 3226 spectra of 253 hot subdwarf stars were analysed to derive atmospheric parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity, and helium abundance) and radial velocities. Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) combined with Gaia parallaxes were used to measure stellar radii, luminosities, and masses. The derived atmospheric parameters reveal a consistent alignment between sdB and sdO stars in the Kiel diagram when compared to theoretical evolutionary models. We identify a population (about 10%) of hot subdwarfs located below the 0.45 Msun zero-age EHB in both the Kiel and Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams, which likely originate from intermediate-mass progenitors (1.8-8 Msun). The overall mass distribution peaks at 0.48 pm 0.12 Msun, while hot subdwarfs below the EHB peak at 0.43 pm 0.10 Msun, supporting non- or semi-degenerate helium ignition characteristic of intermediate-mass stars. Interpolation of EHB and post-EHB tracks yields mass distributions consistent with those derived from SEDs and parallaxes. Assuming a mass range between 0.40 and 0.50 Msun, we find that the post-EHB birthrate is 2-3 times higher than the EHB birthrate, suggesting overestimated EHB lifetimes or contamination from additional formation channels. Our kinematic analysis shows that 86 pm 2% of the stars belong to the Galactic thin disk, with 13 pm 1% and 1 pm 1% associated with the thick disk and halo. The below-EHB population is found exclusively in the thin disk, the only Galactic component young enough to host intermediate-mass progenitors. Its absence from other large samples suggests that non-degenerate formation channels play a more prominent role in the Galactic disk.",

Gormaz-Matamala Submitted to The Open Journal of Astrophysics. We welcome and encourage recommendations on stellar wind models to cite in Table 2, as long as they represent a different model from the others that are already shown Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Stellar winds are a major source of uncertainty in understanding the life and deaths of massive stars. Across studies in the field, prescriptions for stellar winds differ substantially in both their physical assumptions and implementation, making them a dominant contributor to model-to-model variation. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of the physical assumptions underlying commonly adopted wind prescriptions for optically thin and optically thick winds of hot stars, as well as the winds of cool supergiants. Our analysis reveals substantial discrepancies across all regimes: predicted mass-loss rates for optically thin winds differ by more than an order of magnitude, while rates for cool supergiants vary by several orders of magnitude, with even wider uncertainties arising in extrapolation regimes beyond the Humphreys-Davidson limit. These disparities introduce significant ambiguity into the predicted formation of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, a problem further compounded by the inconsistent application of transition criteria. A central issue is the \"cool Wolf-Rayet problem\", a temperature regime where the classical electron-scattering Eddington factor ($\\Gamma_{\\rm e}$) loses physical consistency. Because this factor is widely used to determine WR mass-loss rates, its failure forces models to rely on uncertain extrapolations and ad-hoc corrections. We conclude that the dominant stellar wind uncertainties arise from a mismatch between the physical assumptions in stellar wind models and the structure of the stars to which they are applied. Our framework clarifies the origins of current theoretical discrepancies and identifies the key physical bottlenecks that must be addressed to improve mass-loss modeling for massive stars.",

Stephan, Melinda Soares-Furtado, Keivan G. Stassun, Ricardo Yarza 15 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables, submitted to ApJ Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The engulfment of planets by their host stars is an expected outcome of various dynamical processes and has been invoked to explain a variety of observed stellar properties, such as rapid rotation, chemical abundance abnormalities, and other transient phenomena. Recent observations support engulfment as the cause of such signatures; however, many engulfment process details remain uncertain. Here, we present a model for determining the chemical signatures produced due to the pollution of main sequence stars by rocky planets, a common engulfment scenario due to the high frequency of observed short-period rocky exoplanets. A key novel element of our model is that we calculate the gradual evaporation of the planet due to drag interactions with the stellar envelope, which can lead to observable pollution on the stellar surface even if the bulk of the planet is only destroyed below the star's outer convective zone. Our results indicate that rocky planet pollution is most easily measurable for stars in the $1.0$ to $1.4$ M$_\\odot$ range and that elements such as aluminium, calcium, and vanadium, in addition to lithium, are most suited to detect pollution. We predict that it is also possible to differentiate between the engulfment of one large planet versus several small planets, for the same total pollution mass, for some stellar hosts. We find that rocky planet engulfment events generally take years to decades for most stars. Our results can guide future observational campaigns that may search for sites of past or current engulfment events.",

There is growing evidence that it is also valid for smaller hot planets, but it is not clear whether elements other than iron also influence the properties of planetary systems. To investigate this, we determined the abundances of 13 chemical elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni and Cu) for a sample of 561 Kepler exoplanet-hosting stars using high-resolution Keck/HIRES spectra. We find that stars in systems having only large or hot planets are enriched in some elements relative to those having only small or warm planets, respectively, with this signature being related to the underlying stellar metallicity. This Kepler sample is composed of stars belonging to the Galactic low- and high-$\\alpha$ sequences, corresponding to the chemical thin and thick disks. Our results reveal that stars enhanced in $\\alpha$-elements may facilitate the formation of large planets in metal-poor environments although the iron abundance is still a limiting factor. We also investigated chemical abundances as a function of elemental condensation temperatures and found that there is a diversity of slopes of regardless of the exoplanetary systems hosted by the star. We confirmed that the Sun is depleted in refractory elements relative to the solar twins in our sample, all of which host a diversity of exoplanets, suggesting that this depletion is caused by processes not related to planet formation.",

The properties of the low-frequency fluctuations are of relevance to turbulent energy injection into the plasma and the transport of high-energy cosmic rays. Correlation analysis of decade-long intervals of interplanetary data permits study of fluctuations at time scales much longer than suitably defined correlation times, and therefore at frequencies well below those associated with the Kolmogorov inertial range of {\\it in situ} turbulence. At the frequencies of interest, we study the familiar occurrence of the $1/f$ spectral signature. We also study point spectral features due to solar rotation and their relation with the $1/f$ signal. We report novel properties at timescales ranging from minutes up to years, using data selected by wind speed, phase of solar cycle, and cartesian components of the magnetic field. A surprising finding is that the power in solar rotation harmonics is consistent with an extension of the $1/f$ spectrum, down to frequencies as low as around $\\unit[5 \\times 10^{-7}]{Hz}$. The presence of a broadband $1/f$ spectrum across different wind types supports the interpretation that $1/f$ signals may be related to or even originate from the solar dynamo.",

Utilizing the trained deep learning models and low-resolution spectra from LAMOST DR12, we confirm 1512 hot subdwarfs from the catalog of hot subdwarf candidates, of which 291 are newly identified. Our results demonstrate that the deep learning model not only achieves accuracy comparable to traditional methods in obtaining hot subdwarf atmospheric parameters, but also far exceeds them in speed and efficiency, making it particularly suitable for the analysis of large datasets of hot subdwarf spectra.",

Willcox Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph) We present neutrino-transport algorithms implemented in the toolkit for high-order neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics (thornado) and their coupling to self-gravitating hydrodynamics within the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)-based multiphysics simulation framework Flash-X. thornado, developed primarily for simulations of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), employs a spectral, six-species two-moment formulation with algebraic closure and special-relativistic observer corrections accurate to $O(v/c)$, and uses discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for phase-space discretization combined with implicit-explicit time stepping. A key development is a nonlinear neutrino-matter coupling algorithm based on nested fixed-point iteration with Anderson acceleration, enabling fully implicit treatment of collisional processes, including energy-coupling interactions such as neutrino-electron scattering and pair production. Coupling to finite-volume (FV) hydrodynamics is achieved with a hybrid DG-FV representation of the fluid variables and operator-split evolution in Flash-X. The implementation is verified using basic transport tests with idealized opacities and relaxation and deleptonization problems with tabulated microphysics. Spherically symmetric CCSN simulations demonstrate accuracy and robustness of the coupled scheme, including close agreement with the CCSN simulation code Chimera. An axisymmetric CCSN simulation further demonstrates the viability of DG-based neutrino transport for multidimensional supernova modeling within Flash-X. thornado's neutrino-transport solver is GPU-enabled using OpenMP offloading or OpenACC, and all CCSN applications included in this work use the GPU implementation. Together, these results establish a foundation for future enhancements in physics fidelity, numerical algorithms, and computational performance, for increasingly realistic large-scale CCSN simulations.",

The rising energy consumption of supercomputing facilities poses a significant environmental and financial challenge. In this work, we build upon a recently developed GPU implementation of pinocchio, a widely-used tool for the fast generation of dark matter (DM) halo catalogues, to investigate energy consumption. Using a different resource configuration, we confirmed the time-to-solution behavior observed in a companion study, and we use these runs to compare time-to-solution with energy-to-solution. By profiling the code on various HPC platforms with a newly developed implementation of the Power Measurement Toolkit (PMT), we demonstrate an 8x reduction in energy-to-solution and 8x speed-up in time-to-solution compared to the CPU-only version. Taken together, these gains translate into an overall efficiency improvement of up to 64x. Our results show that the GPU-accelerated pinocchio not only achieves substantial speed-up, making the generation of large-scale mock catalogues more tractable, but also significantly reduces the energy footprint of the simulations. This work represents an step towards ``green-aware\" scientific computing in cosmology, proving that performance and sustainability can be simultaneously achieved.",

Building on this technique, the present study simulates a pulsar population using the PsrPopPy Python module to investigate the technique's limitations and detection capabilities. Among pulsars detectable exclusively by this technique, 50% have duty cycles exceeding the mean value of 0.09 observed in time-domain detections. Our pulsar population simulations revealed a set of observational parameters that optimize pulsar detection. An observation frequency of ~ 1420 MHz and a channel width of ~10 kHz emerge as the optimal configuration to maximize the pulsar detection efficiency. By applying a scintillation-based technique to future radio telescopes like DSA-2000, we can detect 56% of normal pulsars and 84% of MSPs in addition to those detected using non-imaging, time-domain surveys.

Brewer, Joe Llama Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We identify and correct for small but coherent instrumental drifts in seven years of radial velocity data from the EXtreme PREcision Spectrograph (EXPRES). The systematics are most notable for the six months before and after 2022 January, when EXPRES experienced larger temperature variations, and we see a systematic trough-to-peak amplitude of 2.8 m/s in the radial velocities. This is large enough to mimic or obscure planetary signatures. To isolate and correct these effects, we develop a suite of diagnostics that track two-dimensional échellogram shifts, scalings, and rotation, as well as line bisector spans (LBS) derived from laser frequency comb (LFC) lines. By combining these empirical tracers with instrument telemetry in a multi-dimensional regression, we reduce the EXPRES instrument trend traced with solar RVs from an RMS of 1.32 m/s to 0.43 m/s, a 67% improvement, and the aggregate of twelve chromospherically quiet stars show a 26% reduction in velocity scatter. Our injection-recovery simulations further demonstrate a doubling in sensitivity to low-amplitude planetary signals after correction. When applied to the stellar time series of $\\rho$ Coronae Borealis ($\\rho$CrB), the correction removes a spurious planet d signal, restoring the integrity of the data. These results highlight the need for long-term monitoring and multi-dimensional calibration diagnostics on the path toward true centimeter-per-second precision in next-generation EPRV instruments.",

(2023) Vol 127 Issue 40, 20106-20112 Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Surface thermodynamics of minerals influence their properties and occurrence in both terrestrial and planetary systems. Using high-temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry, we report the first direct measurement of the surface energy of enstatite, MgSiO$_3$. Enstatite nanoparticles of different sizes were synthesized using the sol-gel method, characterized with X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, infrared spectroscopy, surface area measurements, and electron microscopy. The materials consist of crystallites with sizes of $\\sim $10 - 20 nm, which are agglomerated into larger nanoparticles. Thus, both surface and interface terms contribute to the measured enthalpies. Analysis based on calorimetry and calculated surface and interface areas gives the surface enthalpy of enstatite as 4.79 $\\pm$ 0.45 J m$^{-2}$. This value is comparable to that of forsterite (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$) and larger than those of many nonsilicate oxide materials. This large surface energy may present a barrier to the nucleation of enstatite in planetary atmospheres and other geochemical and planetary environments. The interfacial energy of enstatite appears to be close to zero. The transition enthalpy from bulk orthoenstatite to bulk clinoenstatite is 0.34 $\\pm$ 0.93 kJ mol$^{-1}$, which is in agreement with earlier reports. The methodology developed here can be extended to other materials having complex structures and morphologies to separate surface and interfacial contributions to energetics.",

Forestano, Eyup B. Unlu, Katia Matcheva, Konstantin T. Matchev Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Machine Learning (cs.LG) This study explores the application of autoencoder-based machine learning techniques for anomaly detection to identify exoplanet atmospheres with unconventional chemical signatures using a low-dimensional data representation. We use the Atmospheric Big Challenge (ABC) database, a publicly available dataset with over 100,000 simulated exoplanet spectra, to construct an anomaly detection scenario by defining CO2-rich atmospheres as anomalies and CO2-poor atmospheres as the normal class. We benchmarked four different anomaly detection strategies: Autoencoder Reconstruction Loss, One-Class Support Vector Machine (1 class-SVM), K-means Clustering, and Local Outlier Factor (LOF). Each method was evaluated in both the original spectral space and the autoencoder's latent space using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics. To test the performance of the different methods under realistic conditions, we introduced Gaussian noise levels ranging from 10 to 50 ppm. Our results indicate that anomaly detection is consistently more effective when performed within the latent space across all noise levels. Specifically, K-means clustering in the latent space emerged as a stable and high-performing method. We demonstrate that this anomaly detection approach is robust to noise levels up to 30 ppm (consistent with realistic space-based observations) and remains viable even at 50 ppm when leveraging latent space representations. On the other hand, the performance of the anomaly detection methods applied directly in the raw spectral space degrades significantly with increasing the level of noise. This suggests that autoencoder-driven dimensionality reduction offers a robust methodology for flagging chemically anomalous targets in large-scale surveys where exhaustive retrievals are computationally prohibitive.",

Minor updates to Findings 7, 8, and Recommendations 4, 6 in v2 Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) In August 2025 a workshop was convened to bring together experts to better understand steps that can be taken to mitigate the impact of satellite constellations on astronomical observations. At the time, just over 12,000 operational satellites were in low-Earth orbit (LEO). Although reflected sunlight and emissions all across the electromagnetic spectrum from artificial satellites impact scientific observations and the sky, the workshop focused on reflected sunlight in the wavelength range 330 nm to 1100 nm. This aligns with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) planned imaging observations over the coming decade. Among other conclusions, we affirm previous recommendations that tracked satellite apparent magnitudes should be no brighter than 7th AB mag. The workshop participants discussed over 30 publications, reports, and presentations, and arrived at the Findings and Recommendations presented here. During the workshop, in addition to affirming many existing recommendations and best practices, the group discovered new issues and devised possible mitigations. These were nearly equally divided between advice to satellite builders and operators and to the observational astronomy community. While the workshop prioritized considerations for LSST, our hope is that many of the Findings and Recommendations will also apply to other observatories and constellations, and that all satellite companies will continue to engage in dialog with sky observers across the globe.",

John Tomsick accepted by ApJ the 30th of december 2025 Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a Compton telescope designed to survey the 0.2 - 5 MeV sky, consisting of a compact array of cross-strip germanium detectors. It is planned to be launched in 2027 into an equatorial low-Earth (530 km) orbit with a prime mission duration of 2 years. The observation of MeV gamma rays is dominated by background, mostly from extragalactic and atmospheric photon but also from the activation of the detector materials induced by cosmic-ray interactions. Thus, background simulation and identification are crucial for the data analysis. In this work we perform Monte Carlo simulations of the background for the first 3 months in orbit, and we extrapolate the results to 2 years in orbit, in order to determine the build-up of the activation due to long-lived isotopes. We determine the rates of events induced by the background that are reconstructed as Compton events in the simulated COSI data. We find that the extragalactic background photons dominate at low energies (<660 keV), while delayed activation from cosmic-ray primaries (proton/alpha) and albedo photons dominate at higher energies. As part of this work, a comparison at low latitude (<1 deg) between recent measurement of the SAA by the High-Energy Particle Detector (HEPD-01) on board the China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES-01) and the AP9/AE9 model has been made, showing an overestimation of the flux by a factor 9 by the model. The systematic uncertainties associated with these components are quantified. This work marks a major step forward in estimating and understanding the expected background rates for the COSI satellite mission.",

Accepted to PASP Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Ground-based astronomy suffers from strong atmospheric line- and thermal continuum emission, at the near infrared (NIR, 0.7-1.1$\\mu$m), and short-wave infrared (SWIR, 1.1-2.5$\\mu$m) wavelengths. The thermal continuum emission increases exponentially towards the red sensitivity cutoff of the state-of-the-art 2.5$\\mu$m cutoff SWIR detectors. Given availability of an optical quality shortpass filter material with strong blocking density in the SWIR, lower cost instrumentation, and higher performance filters could be designed. We demonstrate monopotassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP, chemical formula KH$_2$PO$_4$) as a strong candidate for this purpose. KDP is fully transparent at wavelengths from ultraviolet to 1.3$\\mu$m, but becomes highly opaque at wavelengths >2$\\mu$m. We demonstrate on-sky use of KDP by improving performance of a cryogenic broadband filter with known off-band thermal leak, and using a non-cryogenic narrow band filter for deep observation. KDP reduces the sky background by 4.5 magnitudes in the leaky Z-band filter we use. Our 4nm wide, central wavelength 1.191$\\mu$m narrowband filter in combination with KDP reduces the sky surface brightness by three magnitudes compared to a J broadband, although the effect of KDP is minor due to high blocking density of the broadband filter. We find a sky surface brightness of 18.5 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in our bandpass at 1.191$\\mu$m. KDP is an excellent thermal blocker, when its temperature is maintained above its Curie point at 123K. Below Curie point, KDP transforms its crystal structure, degrading its otherwise good imaging properties.",

We examine the possible roles of planetary interiors, tectonic regimes, continental coverage, volatile cycling, magnetic fields, and atmospheric composition and evolution in shaping long-term climate stability and biospheric potential. Comparisons with Earth and other planets in the Solar System highlight the diversity of planetary conditions and the rarity of conditions relevant to life. We also discuss contingency and convergence in planetary and biological evolution as they relate to the spread of life in the universe. The observational limits of current and planned missions are assessed, emphasizing the need for models that connect internal dynamics to detectable atmospheric and surface signatures as well as the need for laboratory measurements of planetary properties under a wide range of conditions. The large number of exoplanets promises opportunities for empirical and statistical studies of processes that may have occurred earlier in Earth's history, as well as of the other pathways rocky planets and biospheres may take. Thus, exo-geoscience provides a framework for interpreting exoplanet diversity and refining strategies for detecting life beyond the Solar System.",

      "abstract": "Trajectory-Based Dust Evolution in Disks: First Results from the RAPID Simulation Code D. Tarczay-Nehéz Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The rapid depletion of dust particles in protoplanetary disks limits the time available for planetesimal formation, as solids are typically accreted onto the central star before dust particles can undergo substantial growth. Dust traps formed at sharp viscosity transitions $-$ such as at the edges of the accretionally inactive dead zones $-$ can halt radial drift and enhance dust coagulation. In this study, dust dynamics is investigated using \\texttt{RAPID}, a one-dimensional Lagrangian-Eulerian simulation code that tracks representative particle trajectories over time. In order to explore the effect of physical parameters on dust evolution, a grid of 243 models was run. The simulation grid covers a range of parameters such as viscosity, width of the transition region at the edges of the dead zone, disk surface density exponent, and the collisional fragmentation velocity of the dust particles. The computational domain extends from 1 to 50 AU and covers $5\\times10^5$ years of disk evolution, assuming a disk mass of $\\sim 0.005\\,M_\\odot$. The results show that pressure maxima can trap up to $3-10\\,M_\\oplus$ of dust, depending on the local disk conditions. However, increasing the fragmentation velocity, decreasing the viscosity, or widening the dead zone transition width tends to reduce the effectiveness of dust trapping. The simulation results with \\texttt{RAPID} reveal that dust evolution is highly sensitive to the physical conditions of the disk, which governs the early stages of planetesimal growth.",

It is the primary factor limiting the accuracy of orbit determination for such satellites. Up to now, numerous SRP models have been proposed for artificial satellites close to the Earth, but these models have their shortcomings when applied to satellites in the cislunar space. In this study, we concentrate on various scenarios of cislunar satellites in periodic or quasi-periodic orbits. We first employ the box-wing model to simulate the SRP effects and then propose an appropriate general SRP model based on these simulations, termed Empirical NJU Cislunar Model (ENCM). Additionally, several scenario-specific sub-models suited to different mission profiles are developed. Furthermore, the proposed model is verified in the orbit determination process. Comparisons with the conventional cannonball and ECOM models demonstrate that the ENCM model yields a significant improvement in orbit determination accuracy, showing promising potential for future cislunar missions.",

Zurlo 23 pages, 10 figures, Accepted for publication in MNRAS Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Over the past decade, ALMA has uncovered a range of substructures within exoKuiper belts, pointing to a population of undetected planets. With JWST's sensitivity, we now have the opportunity to identify these planets thought to be responsible for the observed substructures in debris discs. We present Cycle 1 JWST/MIRI 11.4 {\\mu}m coronagraphic observations of three exoKuiper belts that exhibit gaps in their radial structures: HD 92945, HD 107146, and HD 206893, to determine whether planets are responsible for carving these structures, as seen in our Solar System with the gas giants. We reduce the JWST/MIRI data using spaceKLIP, and introduce new routines to mitigate the Brighter-Fatter effect and persistence. We do not detect any planet candidates, and all detected objects in the field-of-view are consistent with background stars or galaxies. However, by combining JWST mass limits, archival observational constraints, and astrometric accelerations, we rule out a significant portion of planet parameter space, placing tight constraints on the planets possibly responsible for these gaps. To interpret these results, we explore multiple gap-carving scenarios in discs, either massless or with non-zero mass, including clearing by in-situ planet(s), as well as shaping by inner planets through mean-motion or secular apsidal resonances. Finally, we conclude that the planets causing the proper motion anomaly in these systems must reside within the inner 20 au.",

The absence of such variations in the TESS photometry ($< 200$ ppm limit) physically precludes stellar binary scenarios. We derive a planetary radius of $R_p \\approx 0.55 R_\\oplus$, confirming TOI 864.01 as a physically vetted ultra-short-period sub-Earth.",

Ballering, Minjae Kim, the JDISCS Collaboration Accepted for publication on the Astrophysical Journal Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The evolution of planet-forming regions in protoplanetary disks is of fundamental importance to understanding planet formation. Disks with a central deficit in dust emission, a \"cavity\", have long attracted interest as potential evidence for advanced disk clearing by protoplanets and/or winds. Before JWST, infrared spectra showed that these disks typically lack the strong molecular emission observed in full disks. In this work, we combine a sample of 12 disks with millimeter cavities of a range of sizes ($\\sim2$-70 au) and different levels of millimeter and infrared continuum deficits. We analyze their molecular spectra as observed with MIRI on JWST, homogeneously reduced with the new JDISCS pipeline. This analysis demonstrates a stark dichotomy in molecular emission where \"molecule-rich\" (MR) cavities follow global trends between water, CO, and OH luminosity and accretion luminosity as in full disks, while \"molecule-poor\" (MP) cavities are significantly sub-luminous in all molecules except sometimes OH. Disk cavities generally show sub-luminous organic emission, higher OH/H$_2$O ratios, and suggest a lower water column density. The sub-thermal excitation of CO and water vibrational lines suggests a decreased gas density in the emitting layer in all cavities, supporting model expectations for C$_2$H$_2$ photodissociation. We discover a bifurcation in infrared index (lower in MR cavities) suggesting that the molecular dichotomy is linked to residual $\\mu$m-size dust within millimeter disk cavities. Put together, these results suggest a feedback process between dust depletion, gas density decrease, and molecule dissociation. Disk cavities may have a common evolutionary sequence where MR switch into MP over time.",

While such a trend was anticipated by planetesimal-based planet formation models, it remains unclear what kind of atmospheric metallicity trends emerge from pebble-based planet formation. Moreover, while recent studies of solar system Jupiter suggest that uppermost observable atmosphere may not represent the bulk envelope composition, it remains uncertain how the envelope inhomogeneity influences the atmospheric metallicity trend. In this study, we develop disk evolution and planet formation models to investigate the possible atmospheric metallicity trends of giant exoplanets formed via pebble accretion and how they depend on the metallicity inhomogeneity within the envelope. We find that pebble-based planet formation produces two distinct mass-metallicity relations depending on planetary birthplace. Planets formed beyond the H2O snowline exhibit a mass-metallicity anti-correlation similar to that predicted by planetesimal-based models if their atmospheres are fully convective. This anti-correlation disappears if the convective mixing is inefficient. In contrast, planets formed inside the H2O snowline show a shallower mass-metallicity anti-correlation, regardless of the efficiency of atmospheric mixing. Many gas giants observed by JWST observations lie around the mass-metallicity relation predicted for formation at close-in orbits, although some planets with sub-stellar atmospheric metallicity appear to require unmixed envelopes and formation beyond the H2O snowline. We also examine the relationship between bulk and atmospheric metallicity and find a clear correlation that closely follows atmospheric metallicity that is comparable to bulk metallicity.",

While cometary comae have been studied thoroughly in the pertinent literature, cometary tails have remained less explored. Comparing these regions can reveal differences in the size, structure, and composition of their dust. The goal of this study is to examine the size, structure and composition of the dust particles in the coma and in particular in the tail of the bright comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) and to infer possible differences. For this purpose, we rely on the method of telescopic wide-field polarimetric imaging of the comet in the visible to near-infrared domain in order to obtain the dependence of the degree of linear polarization (DoLP) of the coma and tail on the phase angle across a broad range. An off-the-shelf industrial grade polarization camera was used in combination with a telescope of short aperture ratio. These observations are complemented by T-matrix and Discrete Dipole Approximation modeling using the MSTM5 and DDSCAT software framework, respectively, for simulation of light scattering by dust particles of fractal agglomerate and agglomerate debris morphology. Our observations indicate that the coma exhibits a high maximum DoLP of 0.34, which is further exceeded by a factor of about two by the DoLP of the comet's tail. Our modeling results suggest a 50:50 olivine-carbon composition. The fraction of agglomerate debris was found to be 50% in the coma and possibly higher in the tail. The differences between coma and tail in the observed maximum DoLP and the phase angle at which it occurs can be explained by a predominance of particles with radii larger than 0.6 micrometer in the coma vs. smaller sub-micrometer particles close to the Rayleigh limit in the tail [...]",

The most common method is to perform a systematic search of a database of observed orbits using an orbit dissimilarity criterion (D-criterion) and an algorithm. D-criteria compare the result of an orbit dissimilarity function (D-function) and a threshold. These D-functions associate one value to two meteoroids orbits. If this value is lower than the threshold, the meteoroids' orbits are considered similar. Group of meteors are thus formed. However, not all D-criteria have been evaluated, and their high number makes it hard to know which should be prioritised. This paper presents a review of each D-function, the tests they passed, the threshold choice, and the algorithms they are used with. We show what methods are currently used in the search for meteor showers, presenting statistics based on papers justifying the existence of established meteor showers. We review D-functions from eight different papers. We describe how thresholds and clustering algorithms are usually chosen. We also analyse tests that were performed on D-criteria. We discover that most of those criteria were not properly tested, and that some have been criticised for their theoretical background. Thus, we recommend performing a post-search analysis of the groups found, both in a statistical sense (to make sure the groups formed could not have been formed randomly) and an orbital dynamics sense (to check whether the group could indeed come from a singular parent body), to present the findings as potential meteor showers.",

In particular, the low bulk densities of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, compared to terrestrial planets in our solar system, require either substantial amount of volatiles to be present or a corefree scenario where the metallic core is fully oxidised. Here, using an updated metal-silicate partitioning model, we show that during core-mantle differentiation oxygen becomes more siderophile (iron-loving) implying larger planet radii. For the seven TRAPPIST-1 planets, however, we find that they are not sufficiently large to oxidise all the iron in the core, if they differentiate from an Earth-like composition. Oxygen partitioning in rocky worlds precludes coreless planets up to about 4 Earth masses. The observed density deficit in the TRAPPIST-1 planets, and more generally in M dwarf systems if confirmed by future observations, may be explained by system-dependent element budgets during planet formation, which are intrinsically linked to their stellar metallicity.",

Waite 53 pages, 29 figures, published in JGR:Planets Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets, 131, e2025JE009315 Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Sprawling, turbulent cloud formations dominate the meteorology of Jupiter's mid-to-high latitudes, known as Folded Filamentary Regions (FFRs). A multi-wavelength characterisation by Juno reveals the spatial distribution, vertical structure, and energetics of the FFRs. The cloud tops display multiple lobes of stratiform aerosols, separated by darker, cloud-free lanes, and embedded with smaller eddies and high-altitude cumulus clouds. These cyclonic FFRs are microwave-bright in shallow-sounding wavelengths ($p<5$ bars) and microwave-dark in deep-sounding wavelengths ($p>10$ bars), with the transition potentially associated with the water condensation layer (6-7 bars). Associating microwave contrasts with temperature anomalies, this implies despinning of cyclonic eddies above/below their mid-planes. Despite deep roots (being detectable in wavelengths sounding $\\sim100$ bars), they are ``pancake vortices'' with horizontal extents at least an order of magnitude larger than their depth. In the northern hemisphere, FFRs are most common in cyclonic belts poleward of $40^\\circ$N (all latitudes are planetocentric), particularly a North Polar Filamentary Belt (NPFB) near $66-70^\\circ$N that defines the transition from organised belts/zones to the chaotic polar domain. This distribution explains the high lightning rates from $45-80^\\circ$N, peaking in a belt poleward of $52.3^\\circ$N, which may trace the availability of water for moist convection. Many observed lightning flashes can be associated to specific FFRs containing bright storms, but some FFRs display no activity, suggesting quiescent periods during storm evolution. Analogies to Earth's oceanic eddies suggest that cyclones deform isentropic surfaces at their midplanes, raising deep water-rich layers upwards to promote moist convection, release latent heat, and inject clouds into the upper troposphere.",

This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach's assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.",
