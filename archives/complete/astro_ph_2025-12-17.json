As these binaries inspiral due to gravitational-wave radiation, they can reach contact and begin mass transfer in the millihertz band. Gravitational-wave detectors like LISA will survey such compact binaries across the Milky Way, yielding samples numbering in the tens of thousands, with essentially complete sensitivity to orbital periods shorter than ~10-20 min (e.g. Lamberts et al. 2019). Assessing the nature of the binary components - and deriving masses, temperatures and compositions - requires systematic electromagnetic characterisation that breaks gravitational-wave degeneracies and enables full atmospheric and orbital solutions. At present, no dedicated facility or coordinated survey is planned to deliver electromagnetic follow-up at the scale necessary to maximise the science return of the millihertz gravitational-wave data; this white paper discusses the need and requirements of such a capability.",

      "abstract": "The Effect of a Self-bound Equation of State on the Structure of Rotating Compact Stars Andreas Konstantinou High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) This paper investigates how a self bound equation of state (EOS), which describes strange quark stars, affects the rotational properties of compact stars, focusing on deviations from universal relations governing gravitational mass and radius changes due to rotation. The analysis reveals significant deviations in stars with higher surface-to-center total energy-density ratios, $\\frac{\\epsilon_s}{\\epsilon_c+c^2P_c}$, challenging the established universal relations. For Newtonian stars, hydrostatic equilibrium ensures that the difference between the gravitational potential at the center, $\\Phi_c$, and at the poles, $\\Phi_p$, remains constant within sequences of rotating neutron stars characterized by the same central and polar specific enthalpy ($\\Phi_c - \\Phi_p = -h_c +h_p$). Combined with the scaling $\\Phi \\propto R_e^2$, where $R_e$ denotes the equatorial radius, this condition naturally leads to a quasi-universal behavior in the rotational change of radius within these sequences. Similarly, in general relativistic stars, the hydrostatic equilibrium maintains that $\\Phi^{GR}_{p} - \\Phi^{GR}_{c}$ remains unchanged within these sequences, where $\\Phi^{GR}$ is one of the metric potentials. Inspired by this theoretical framework, a toy model has been developed to capture the dependence of gravitational mass and radius deviations on the surface-to-central total energy density ratio. Subsequently, an improved set of empirical universal relations has been proposed, for accurately modeling rapidly rotating compact stars with self-bound EOSs.",

AttenGW combines a per-detector hierarchical dilated convolutional network with an attention-based aggregation module that enforces cross-detector coherence, providing an alternative to graph-based aggregation schemes used in previous work. The pipeline adopts a LIGO-style preprocessing and data-loading workflow based on GWOSC time series, with standard whitening and filtering, and is released as a documented Python/PyTorch package. We benchmark AttenGW using simulated injections to estimate sensitive volume and on real O3 data, focusing on the February 2020 segment previously used to evaluate a spatiotemporal graph ensemble. On this month of data, a single AttenGW model reduces the false-positive rate relative to a single graph-based detector by a factor of a few, and an ensemble of three AttenGW models matches the performance of the corresponding six-model ensemble. Injection studies on real LIGO noise further indicate that attention-based aggregation yields stable performance on non-Gaussian backgrounds.",

The constraints are given by using $\\chi^2$ analysis combined with high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (HFQPO) data observed from three microquasars: GRS 1915+105, XTE 1550-564, and GRO J1655-40. The results indicate that the magnetic field significantly influences the position of the innermost stable circular orbit of charged particle and frequency distribution of epicyclic motion, which excites more resonance model variants, enhancing observational effects. Additionally, we employ the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to evaluate resonance model and its various variants. The support for different models from observational data shows significant variation: $E R_8$ as the best model is supported strongly, $ER_3$ model has moderate evidence of support, $ER_6$ and $ER_7$ models are considerably less support, while other resonance models have essentially no support. For models more supported by the observational data, the allowed ranges of the regularization parameter: $0\\leq a<0.736$ ($68\\%$ confidence level) suggests that HFQPOs data support the magnetized black bounce spacetime as a regular black hole, and the smaller value of the regularization parameter indicates a possibility of the presence of quantum effects. According to the constraint results, we get the best-fit values of magnetic field strength around $10^{-5}\\sim 10^{-4}$ GS for electrons and around $10^{-2}\\sim 10^{-1}$ GS for protons. Finally, as a comparison, we test the SV spacetime without a magnetic field using microquasar observational data, and the calculated results of AIC show that this case is incompatible with the HFQPOs data, further supporting the existence of a magnetic field in SV spacetime.",

This paper is related to our two earlier papers: 1. arXiv:2412.19665, 2. arXiv:2506.17422 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been studied as alternate probes in cosmology due to their large and stable luminosities and broad redshift range. Previously it was shown that higher-redshift AGN that were reverberation-mapped (RM) using broad Mg\\,\\textsc{ii} and C\\,\\textsc{iv} lines are standardizable and yield weak cosmological constraints that are consistent with those from better-established probes. In contrast, lower-redshift AGN that were reverberation-mapped using the broad H$\\beta$ line exhibited tensions with the standard cosmological model, in particular they preferred currently decelerating cosmological expansion. Here we study the standardizability of a homogeneous RM H$\\beta$ sample of $\\sim 100$ AGN (over redshifts $0.00308 \\leq z \\leq 0.8429$), whose H$\\beta$ time delays and three luminosity tracers (at 5100\\,Å\\,, broad H$\\beta$, and narrow [O\\,\\textsc{iii}]) are averaged over several epochs. We find that this averaged sample is standardizable using three $R-L$ relations. While for luminosities corresponding to 5100\\,Å\\, and the broad H$\\beta$ line the cosmological constraints prefer currently decelerating cosmological expansion, the cosmological parameters for the narrow [O\\,\\textsc{iii}] luminosity are more consistent with those from better-established probes and they are in agreement with currently accelerating cosmological expansion. This demonstrates for the first time that narrow-line region [O\\,\\textsc{iii}] can be utilized for AGN standardization and cosmological constraints. Selecting proper photoionizing flux proxies for the broad-line region is thus crucial in studies of RM AGN standardizability.",

Burgess, Eleonora Di Valentino Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Axio-dilaton cosmology provides a minimal benchmark model for both Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE) that is well motivated by fundamental physics. The axion and dilaton arise as pseudo-Goldstone modes of symmetries that predict particle masses depend on the dilaton, and therefore to evolve cosmologically, leading to correlated modifications of recombination physics, the sound horizon, and late-time expansion and growth histories. We confront this model with Planck 2018 temperature, polarisation, and lensing data, SPT-3G high-$\\ell$ measurements, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon$+$ supernovae, assuming that the axion makes up all of the dark matter and that the dilaton plays the role of a dark energy field. We find that it fits the data somewhat better than $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, with the $\\chi^2$ lowered by $\\simeq 7$ for three additional parameters, and significantly raises the inferred Hubble constant to $H_0 \\simeq 69.2\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the Hubble tension to $\\lesssim 3\\sigma$ and thereby allowing a joint fit of CMB and SH0ES data. The model fits this enlarged data set as well as the $w_0w_a$ model with an electron mass modified by hand at recombination, though it does so with calculable dynamics. Axio-dilaton self-interactions robustly fake a phantom equation of state in DESI measurements. There is a sting: cosmology prefers dilaton-matter couplings $|\\mathbf{g}|\\sim 10^{-2}$-$10^{-1}$, which are large enough to have been detected in solar-system tests of General Relativity. These results show how axio-dilatons can provide a viable cosmology preferred by current data at surprisingly large couplings, within a framework that links dark energy, dark matter, and time-dependent particle masses in a coherent way. They suggest both new observable signals and new theoretical directions, aimed at resolving the apparent inconsistency with non-cosmological observations.",

In standard scenarios, failing to detect a scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) background would exclude the last viable window for PBH DM formed through critical collapse. We show that this conclusion becomes much weaker in the presence of astrophysical foregrounds and strongly non-Gaussian primordial density perturbations, by studying how these phenomena affect the link between SIGWs and PBHs, and reevaluate LISA's sensitivity to asteroid-mass PBHs. In addition, we analyse the interplay between PBHs and SIGWs to gain further insights into the nature of primordial non-Gaussianity. We find that uncertainties in $f_{\\rm NL}$ can induce substantial uncertainties in the PBH abundance, which ultimately limits LISA's capacity to fully probe the asteroid-mass PBH DM window.",

In this work, we investigate the viability of polynomial potential inflation in light of the latest ACT data, systematically analyzing cases from $n=2$ to $n=5$. By exploring the parameter space and deriving constraints on the model coefficients, we find that the cubic to quintic models can provide a good fit to the data, while the quadratic model struggles to simultaneously accommodate the ACT data and the requirement of sufficient inflation. Notably, the quintic case ($n=5$) not only matches cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations but also produces an inflection point that simultaneously triggers primordial black hole formation and generates a scalar-induced gravitational wave. These findings establish higher-order polynomial potentials as compelling frameworks and reconcile precision CMB measurements with multi-messenger probes of early-universe physics.",

In this work, we develop a general framework for the study of Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ gravity, a theory that was proven to successfully realise inflation and quintessence, and consider the case of the Starobinsky-like model as an example. A regime of radiation domination with a subdominant matter component is assumed, allowing for a well-motivated perturbative approach to the gravity modifications. We calculate the kernel function and the density spectrum numerically and find accurate analytical expressions. The spectral density, which may be tested across a wide range of frequencies by upcoming Gravitational Wave experiments, is shown to differ from the General Relativity and metric $f(R)$ gravity predictions under certain conditions. We comment on previous results in the literature regarding the metric formulation and make special emphasis on the potential of these distinctive features of the spectrum to probe the two formalisms of gravity.",

We also derive angular correlation curves of the timing residuals.

Their extreme luminosities cannot be explained by the radioactive decay of $^{56}\\mathrm{Ni}$ and its daughter $^{56}\\mathrm{Co}$ alone. Consequently, models invoking newly formed millisecond magnetars have been widely proposed, capable of supplying additional energy through magnetic dipole radiation. For these rapidly rotating magnetars, however, gravitational-wave (GW) emission may also contribute significantly to the spin-down, particularly during their early evolutionary stages. While high-energy photons initially remain trapped within the optically thick ejecta, they will eventually escape as the ejecta becomes transparent during the expansion, thereby influencing the late-time lightcurve. In this work, we adopt an analytical framework to systematically explore the combined effects of GW emission and high-energy leakage on the lightcurve of SLSNe. Compared to scenarios that neglect these processes, we find that for magnetars with initial spin periods of millisecond, the combined influence suppresses early-time luminosities but enhances late-time emission. We further investigate the effects of the neutron-star equation of state to the lightcurve, GW emission efficiency, ejecta mass, and other relevant quantities. Our results highlight the complex interplay between GW-driven spin-down and radiative transport in shaping the observable features of SLSNe, offering new insights into diagnosing the nature of their central engines.",

Although this approximation is valid in most cases, it has been recently pointed out that it breaks down during transition periods between attractor and non-attractor phases. Such transitions are ubiquitous in single-field models giving rise to enhanced perturbations at small scales, that are required to form primordial black holes. The current inability to apply the stochastic-inflation program in such models is therefore one of the main obstacles to investigating the role of backreaction in primordial-black-hole scenarios. In this work, we show how gradient interactions can be incorporated in stochastic inflation, via a set of Langevin equations of higher dimension. We apply our formalism to a few cases of interest, including one with a sharp transition. In all cases, in the classical limit we show that gradient corrections as predicted from cosmological perturbation theory are properly recovered. We uncover the existence of a \"pullback\" effect by which the tails of the first-passage-time distributions are dampened by gradient interactions. We finally discuss the role of backreaction in the presence of gradient interactions.",

Along with presenting the complete analytic expression and corresponding numerical results, we also derive simplified formulas valid in the large- and small-$k$ limits, as well as in the Minkovski limit. The latter expansion reveals that the Minkovski approximation breaks down for $\\beta / H_* \\lesssim 10$, where $\\beta$ denotes the inverse duration of the phase transition and $H_*$ the Hubble parameter at its completion. Furthermore, the next-to-leading-order term contributes about a $10\\%$ correction for $\\beta / H_* \\sim 140$, a typical value for the electroweak phase transition.",

Accepted to ApJ. Comments welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (LVK) Collaboration has detected numerous binary black hole mergers with properties that challenge standard binary evolution scenarios, such as component masses above the pair-instability gap and high spin magnitudes. Dense stellar environments such as globular clusters provide a natural channel for producing such systems through hierarchical mergers, where black hole remnants formed in earlier mergers are retained in the cluster and undergo successive mergers. However, gravitational-wave recoil kicks often eject merger remnants from typical globular clusters, which limits hierarchical growth. Massive clusters with deeper potential wells, such as those found in giant elliptical galaxies like M87, may overcome this barrier, but direct simulations of such massive globular clusters remains computationally challenging. In this study, we present a 10-million-body cluster simulation performed with the $\\texttt{Cluster Monte Carlo}$ ($\\texttt{CMC}$) code, referred to as $\\texttt{colossus}$, which serves as a proxy for the most massive low-metallicity globular clusters observed in the local Universe. This simulation demonstrates that extended chains of hierarchical mergers can occur in massive globular clusters, producing black holes up to fifth generation with masses approaching $250\\,M_\\odot$, comparable to the most massive LVK events observed to date (e.g., GW231123). Combining the $\\texttt{colossus}$ simulation with the previous $\\texttt{CMC Cluster Catalog}$, we develop a framework to extrapolate binary black hole merger predictions for the thousands of globular clusters seen in the Virgo Supercluster.",

Medeiros Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We analyze the Starobinsky inflation model and the impact of curvature corrections, particularly a cubic $R^3$ term, to assess their behavior in light of the latest observational results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). With the recent sixth data release (DR6), the scalar spectral index was measured to be $n_s=0.9743 \\pm 0.0034$, which appears to exclude the pure Starobinsky model at approximately the $2\\sigma$ level. In this paper, we implement the Starobinsky inflationary potential directly into the CLASS code, without relying on the slow-roll approximation, and we constrain the number of e-folds of inflation $N_k$ using a theoretically motivated range derived from reheating considerations and standard couplings between matter fields and gravity. We show that it is still possible to identify a significant region of parameter space where the Starobinsky model remains highly consistent with the latest observational data. While the pure Starobinsky model remains a compelling candidate for cosmic inflation, we explore how including a cubic $R^3$ term can shift its predictions to better align with the Planck and ACT measurements.",

A central result is that these power spectra can directly capture the local primordial non-Gaussianity imprinted in large-scale structure.

The hadronic matter equation of state (EoS) is modeled using a relativistic mean-field approach, constrained by chiral effective field theory ($\\chi$EFT) calculations at low densities, finite nuclei and heavy-ion collision data at intermediate densities, and neutron star (NS) observations at high densities. For the dark sector, we consider fermionic dark matter (FDM) interacting via a dark vector meson, and two bosonic dark matter models (BDM1 and BDM2) characterized by self-interacting scalar fields. Bayesian inference is employed to constrain the model parameters, including the dark matter mass, coupling strength, and dark matter fraction within NSs. Our analysis finds that all models yield consistent nuclear matter parameters, allowing a small dark matter fraction under 10%. The presence of dark matter slightly softens the EoS, leading to a modest reduction in NS mass, radius, and tidal deformability, though all models remain compatible with NICER and GW170817 observations. The log-evidence and likelihood analyses reveal no statistical preference among the FDM and BDM models, indicating that current astrophysical data cannot decisively distinguish between fermionic and bosonic dark matter scenarios. This study provides a unified statistical framework to constrain dark matter properties using NS observables.",

To be submitted to MNRAS Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present a quadratic estimator that detects and reconstructs spatially-varying multiplicative ($m-$) bias in weak lensing shear measurements, by exploiting the $EB$ mode coupling that it generates. The method combines $E$ and $B$ modes with inverse-variance weights, to yield an unbiased reconstruction of $m(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ to first order. We study the ability of future Stage IV surveys to obtain an unbiased reconstruction of the $m$-bias in differing scenarios, considering differing bias morphologies, and characteristic scales, as well as differing metrics to quantify the signal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed map. Considering an $m$ pattern repeating on $\\sim 1^\\circ\\times1^\\circ$ sky patches, as might be the case for an $m$ field caused by focal-plane systematics. With a Euclid-like redshift distribution, we find that $\\sim5\\%$ rms variations in $m$-bias may be detected at the 20$\\sigma$ level, after stacking between $\\sim400$ and $\\sim1000$ patches (rising to between $\\sim2800$ and $\\sim7600$ for $1\\%$ rms variations, data volumes that are becoming available with upcoming surveys), depending on the morphology of the $m$ pattern. We show that these results are robust against the cosmological model assumed in the reconstruction, as well as the presence of intrinsic alignments or baryonic effects, and that the method shows no spurious response to additive ($c-$) bias. These results demonstrate that percent-level, spatially-varying $m-$bias can be detected at high significance, enabling diagnosis and mitigation in the Stage IV weak lensing era.",

The statistical power of the ongoing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) demands precise theoretical tools to model the Lya forest. We present a hybrid effective field theory (HEFT) forward model in redshift space that leverages the accuracy of non-linear particle displacements computed using the N-body simulation suite AbacusSummit with the predictive power of an analytical, perturbative bias forward model in the framework of the effective field theory (EFT). The residual noise between the model and the simulated Lya field has a nearly white (scale-and orientation-independent) power spectrum on quasi-linear scales, substantially simplifying its modeling compared to a purely perturbative description. As a consequence of the improved control over the 3D Lya forest stochasticity, we find agreement between the modeled and the true power spectra at the 5 per cent level down to scales of k <= 1 h/Mpc. This procedure offers a promising path toward constructing efficient and accurate emulators to predict large-scale clustering summary statistics for full-shape cosmological analyses of Lya forest data from both DESI and its successor, DESI-II.",

We test this interpretation by performing a non-parametric exploration of the minimally coupled, luminal Horndeski subclass known as kinetic gravity braiding (KGB). Using mochi_class and its manifestly stable effective field theory (EFT) basis implementation, we efficiently scan a broad class of models in which the EFT functions are allowed to vary freely in time, while enforcing the absence of ghost and gradient instabilities from the outset. We identify a set of KGB models that realize phantom crossing and remain broadly consistent with current probes of the background and linear large-scale structure, including CMB temperature and lensing power spectra, redshift-space distortions, cosmic shear, and the cross-correlation between galaxies and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. Our results demonstrate that viable phantom-crossing solutions exist without conformal coupling, motivating future full Bayesian analyses of this model class with non-parametric EFT priors.",

We describe the data processing pipeline developed to calibrate and image these fast-scanning observations, producing high-fidelity continuum images at a central frequency of 816 MHz. The resulting mosaic reaches an RMS sensitivity of $\\sim$35 $\\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ in its deepest regions, with a typical angular resolution of $\\sim32'' \\times 17''$. In these images, we identify $95483$ radio sources. We validate the catalogue through cross-matching with external surveys, confirming sub-arcsecond astrometric accuracy and a robust flux density scale. We compute the differential source counts, finding excellent agreement with existing measurements and validating our end-to-end processing.

We present the design and first results of the MeerKLASS On-the-Fly (OTF) continuum data, which exploits the visibilities recorded during fast, constant-elevation scans. This observing mode enables fast commensal imaging over several hundred of square degrees on a nightly basis. We describe the OTF survey strategy and pipeline, focusing on handling challenges introduced by the current MeerKAT fixed-delay correlation observing mode, which causes decorrelation (smearing). We implement a correction scheme based on time-dependent phase rotation, direction-dependent PSF modeling, and wide-band faceted deconvolution with \\texttt{DDFacet}. Using UHF-band and pilot L-band data, we demonstrate the recovery of high-quality 2-second snapshot images and deep mosaics over hundreds of square degrees. After smearing correction we are able to achieve a resolution of $23.3$arcsec and $14$ arcsec with an rms sensitivity of $35 \\mu {\\rm Jy\\,beam}^{-1}$ and $ 33 \\mu {\\rm Jy\\,beam}^{-1}$ in the UHF and L-band respectively.

Furtak, Masamune Oguri Submitted to ApJ; 18 pages, 8 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present a catalog of 57 high-redshift $z>6$ galaxy candidates, including 14 spectroscopic confirmations ($z = 6.10$ -- 9.25), 2 Little Red Dots ($z = 4.77$, 5.81), and 2 interlopers ($z = 3.23$, 3.72), based on \\JWST\\ NIRCam imaging (7 filters), NIRSpec spectroscopy (PRISM and G395H), and archival \\HST\\ imaging (17 filters) of the strong lensing galaxy cluster MACS0647. Our highest redshift confirmation ($z = 9.25$) is an Extremely Blue Galaxy (presented in~\\citealt{Yanagisawa2024}), and here we identify a spectral turnover likely due to damped Lyman-$\\alpha$. We identify an overdensity of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts $z = 6.1$, confirming the $z \\sim 6$ overdensity identified in \\HST\\ images. In one of these galaxies, our high-resolution G395H spectroscopy reveals two spatially resolved components with a velocity difference of $\\sim$90 km/s; if these components are gravitationally bound, this would imply a dynamical mass on the order of $\\sim 10^8\\ M_\\odot$ given their projected separation. We present spectral line fluxes, widths, and derived physical properties, including stellar masses ($10^8 - 10^9 \\ \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$) and metallicities ($10\\% - 40\\% \\ \\mathrm{Z}_{\\odot}$) for our spectroscopic sample.

Johnson Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Numerical methods for radiative transfer play a key role in modern-day astrophysics and cosmology, including study of the inhomogeneous reionization process. In this context, ray tracing methods are well-regarded for accuracy but notorious for high computational cost. In this work, we extend the capabilities of the Nyx N-body / hydrodynamics code, coupling radiation to gravitational and gas dynamics. We formulate adaptive ray tracing as a novel series of filters and transformations that can be used with AMReX particle abstractions, simplifying implementation and enabling portability across Exascale GPU architectures. To address computational cost, we present a new algorithm for merging sources, which significantly accelerates computation once reionization is well underway. Furthermore, we develop a novel prescription for geometric overlap correction with low-density neighbor cells. We perform verification and validation against standard analytic and numerical test problems. Finally, we demonstrate scaling to up to 1024 nodes and 4096 GPUs running multiphysics cosmological simulations, with 4096^3 Eulerian gas cells, 4096^3 dark matter particles, and ray tracing on a 1024^3 coarse grid.

This cluster located at $z=0.0556$ hosts prominent radio relics associated with merger-driven shocks, suggesting the presence of relativistic electrons capable of producing inverse-Compton (IC) emission in the 30--300~keV band. Using standard OSA~11.2 imaging and spectral pipelines and a total effective exposure of 2506~s, we find no significant emission at the cluster position in any energy interval. The extracted ISGRI spectrum is consistent with pure background, and no physically meaningful model parameters can be constrained. From the mosaic variance maps, we derive a conservative $3\\sigma$ upper limit of $F_{30-300\\,\\mathrm{keV}} < 6.9 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,cm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$ assuming a power-law spectrum with $\\Gamma = 2$.

In terms of scalability, the multi-level PM spatial decomposition reduces the computational complexity to nearly linear. Precision is ensured by the optimized Green's function that seamlessly bridges gravitational interactions between multi-level PM and Particle-Particle (PP) calculations. The program design enhances per-core/node efficiency in processing $N$-body particles, while a fixed-point data storage format addresses memory constraints for large particle counts.

We aim to measure the inter-band continuum time delays through photometric monitoring of Seyfert galaxy Fairall~9 to construct the lag-spectrum. Additionally, we explain the observed features in the Fairall~9 lag-spectrum and discuss the potential drivers behind them, based on our newly collected data from the Obserwatorium Cerro Murphy (OCM) telescope. We initiated a long-term, continuous AGN photometric monitoring program in 2024, titled 'Hubble constant constraints through AGN Light curve Observations' (HALO) using intermediate and broad band filters. Here, we present the first results from HALO, focusing on photometric light curves and continuum time-delay measurements for Fairall~9. To complement these observations and extend the wavelength coverage of the lag-spectrum, we also reanalyzed archival Swift light curves and spectroscopic data available in the literature. Using HALO and Swift light curves, we measured inter-band continuum delays to construct the lag-spectrum of Fairall~9. Excess lags appear in the $u$ and $U$ bands (Balmer continuum contamination) and in the $I$ band (Paschen jump/dust emission from the torus). Overall, the lag-spectrum deviates significantly from standard disk model predictions. We find that inter-band delays deviate from the power-law, $\\tau_{\\lambda} \\propto \\lambda^{\\beta}$ due to BLR scattering, reprocessing, and dust contributions at longer wavelengths. Power-law fits are therefore not well suited for characterizing the nature of the time delays.",

Marked Correlation Functions (MCFs) extend information beyond the two-point correlation. For the first time, this study integrated the tomographic AP test with MCFs to constrain the flat $w$CDM cosmology model. Our findings show that multiple density weights in MCFs outperform the traditional two-point correlation function, reducing the uncertainties of the matter density parameter $\\Omega_m$ and dark energy equation of state $w$ by 48\\% and 45\\%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce a novel principal component analysis (PCA) compression scheme that efficiently projects high-dimensional statistical measurements into a compact set of eigenmodes while preserving most of the cosmological information. This approach retains significantly more information than traditional coarse binning methods, which simply average adjacent bins in a lossy manner, yielding an additional $\\sim 40\\%$ reduction in error margins. To assess robustness, we incorporate realistic redshift errors expected in future spectroscopic surveys. While these errors modestly degrade cosmological constraints, our combined framework, which utilizes MCFs and PCA compression within tomographic AP tests, is less affected and always yields tight cosmological constraints. This scheme remains highly promising for upcoming slitless spectroscopic surveys, such as the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST).",

Johnson, Moritz Münchmeyer 28+7 pages, 18 figures; revised Introduction, Section 7, and added an appendix, results unchanged Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) For many analyses in cosmology it is necessary to reconstruct the likely distribution of unobserved fields, such as dark matter or non-luminous baryons, from observed luminous tracers. The dominant approach in cosmology has been to use the so-called halo model, which assumes radially symmetric profiles centered around luminous tracers such as galaxies. More recently, field-level machine learning methods have been proposed that can learn to estimate the unobserved field after being trained on simulations. However, it is unclear whether machine learning methods indeed significantly improve over linear methods or the halo model. In this paper we make a systematic comparison of different approaches to reconstruct dark matter and non-luminous baryons, from galaxy data using the CAMELS simulations. These simulations are in a $25\\ \\texttt{Mpc/h}$ box, allowing us to compare performance on the mildly non-linear scales $(k\\sim 0.4\\ \\mathrm{h/Mpc})$ down to the size of individual halos. We find the best results using a combined GNN-CNN approach. We also provide a general analysis and visualization of the relationship of matter, non-luminous baryons, halos, and galaxies in these simulations to interpret our results.",

Published in JCAP J. Cosmol. Astropart. Phys. 12 (2025) 009 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Subhalos play a crucial role in accurately modeling galaxy formation and galaxy-based cosmological probes within the highly nonlinear, virialized regime. However, numerical convergence of subhalo evolution is difficult to achieve, especially in the inner regions of host halos where tidal forces are strongest. I investigate the numerical convergence and correction methods for the abundance, spatial, and velocity distributions of subhalos using two $6144^3$-particle cosmological N-body simulations with different mass resolutions -- Jiutian-300 ($1.0 \\times 10^{7}\\,h^{-1}M_{\\odot}$) and Jiutian-1G ($3.7 \\times 10^{8}\\,h^{-1}M_{\\odot}$) -- with subhalos identified by HBT+. My study shows that the Surviving subhalo Peak Mass Function (SPMF) converges only for subhalos with $m_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ above $5000$ particles but can be accurately recovered by including orphan subhalos that survive according to the merger timescale model of Jiang et al., which outperforms other models. Including orphan subhalos also enables recovery of the real-space spatial and velocity distributions to $5$--$10\\%$ accuracy down to scales of $0.1$--$0.2\\,h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$. The remaining differences are likely due to cosmic variance and finite-box effects in the smaller Jiutian-300 simulation. Convergence below $0.1\\,h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$ remains challenging and requires more sophisticated modeling of orphan subhalos. I further highlight that redshift-space multipoles are more difficult to recover even at larger scales because unreliable small-scale pairs at $r_{\\mathrm{p}} < 0.1\\,h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$ in real space affect scales of tens of $\\mathrm{Mpc}$ in redshift space due to elongated Fingers-of-God effects. Therefore, for redshift-space statistics, I recommend using modified or alternative measures that reduce sensitivity to small projected separations in subhalo-based studies.",

We explore a range of initial conditions and potential configurations that facilitate such a phantom-to-quintessence-like crossing, and find that this can be naturally realised with hill-top or cliff-face potentials bound from above. We study how varying these conditions affects the dynamics of the system, calculate the background observables and compare them with DESI, CMB, and Type Ia supernova data, identifying a viable parameter space for our model. In particular, we find that a potential featuring a hyperbolic tangent form can successfully reproduce the desired phantom crossing, although such models can suffer from fine-tuning effects. Finally, we discuss prospects for distinguishing such models with upcoming state-of-the-art cosmological observations.",

Karachentsev 15 pages + appendix, 9 figures, 4 tables, accepted for publication in A&A Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) This study of the M81 complex and its Hubble flow delivers new and improved Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB)-based distances for nine member galaxies, yielding a total of 58 galaxies with high-precision TRGB distances. With those, we perform a systematic analysis of the group's dynamics in the core and its embedding in the local cosmic environment. Our analysis confirms that the satellite galaxies of the M81 complex exhibit a flattened, planar distribution almost perpendicular to the supergalactic pole and thus aligned with a larger-scale filamentary structure in the Local Universe. We demonstrate that the properties of the group's barycentre are robustly constrained by the two brightest members, M81 and M82, and that correcting heliocentric velocities for the solar motion in the Local Group decreases the velocity dispersion of the group. Then applying minor and major infall models, we fit the local Hubble flow to constrain the Hubble Constant and the total mass of the M81 complex. The joint best-fit parameters from both models yield $H_0 = \\left(63 \\pm 6 \\right)$ km/s/Mpc and total mass of $(2.28\\pm 0.49) \\times 10^{12} M_{\\odot}$. We thus arrive at an increased mass estimate compared to prior work but reach a higher consistency with virial, $(2.74 \\pm 0.36)\\times 10^{12}\\,M_\\odot$, and projected-mass estimates, $(3.11 \\pm 0.69)\\times 10^{12} M_\\odot$. Moreover, our $H_0$ estimate shows an agreement with Planck, consistent with other TRGB-based Local-Universe inferences of $H_0$ and still within a 2-$\\sigma$ agreement with Cepheid-based Local-Universe probes.",

Accepted by Astrophysical Journal on 9 December 2025 Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) SPHEREx, a NASA explorer satellite launched on 11 March 2025, is carrying out the first all-sky near-infrared spectral survey. The satellite observes in 102 spectral bands from 0.75 to 5.0 um with a resolving power ranging from 35 to 130 in 6.2 arcsecond pixels. The observatory obtains a 5-sigma depth of 19.5 - 19.9 AB mag for 0.75 to 3.8 um and 17.8 - 18.8 AB mag for 3.8 to 5.0 um after mapping the full sky four times over two years. Scientifically, SPHEREx will produce a large galaxy redshift survey over the full sky, intended to constrain the amplitude of inflationary non-Gaussianity. The observations will produce two deep spectral maps near the ecliptic poles that will use intensity mapping to probe the evolution of galaxies over cosmic history. By mapping the depth of infrared absorption features over the Galactic plane, SPHEREx will comprehensively survey the abundance and composition of water and other biogenic ice species in the interstellar medium. The initial data are rapidly released in the form of spectral images to the public. The project will release specialized data products over the life of the mission as the surveys proceed. The science team will also produce specialized spectral catalogs on planet-bearing and low-mass stars, solar system objects, and galaxy clusters 3 years after launch. We describe the design of the instrument and spacecraft, which flow from the core science requirements. Finally, we present an initial evaluation of the in-flight performance and key characteristics.",

Gamma-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offers the opportunity to indirectly probe such an intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), as gamma rays interact with cosmic radiation fields, producing electron-positron pairs, and initiate an electromagnetic cascade. The deflection of the pairs in the IGMF results in a time-delayed signal at GeV energies. Using observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope of the GRB 221009A, we are able to derive the most stringent constraints to date from the non-observation of the cascade and rule out magnetic fields B < 2.5 x 10^{-17} G at 95% confidence level for a coherence length larger than 1 Mpc. Our results are comparable to limits obtained from blazar observations but do not suffer from assumptions on the duty cycle of the gamma-ray source or whether inverse-Compton scattering losses dominate over the development of plasma instabilities.",

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy of GLIMPSE-16043, a promising $z\\sim6$ Pop III candidate originally identified through NIRCam photometry as having weak [OIII]$\\lambda\\lambda4959,5007$ emission. Our follow-up reveals clear [OIII] emission, ruling out a genuine zero-metallicity nature. However, the combination of the measured line fluxes and photometry indicates that its spectral energy distribution requires an extraordinarily strong Balmer jump ($-1.66 \\pm 0.47$ mag) and H$\\alpha$ equivalent width ($3750\\pm1800$ Å), features that cannot be reproduced by current stellar+nebular or pure nebular photoionization models. The only models approaching the observations to almost within $1\\sigma$ involve a hot ($T_{\\rm eff}\\!\\simeq\\!10^{4.7}$ K) single blackbody embedded in a low-$T_{\\rm e}$ nebular environment, suggestive of scenarios such as a tidal-disruption event or a microquasar with strong disk winds. This cautions that photometric Pop~III selections are vulnerable to contamination when the rest-frame optical continuum is undetected. Motivated by this, we refine the photometric Pop III selection criteria to exclude the locus of extreme Balmer-jump objects. The revised criteria also recover the recently reported spectroscopic candidate AMORE6, demonstrating that the updated selection preserves sensitivity to genuine Pop III-like sources while removing key contaminants. Applying the refined criteria across legacy survey fields and five newly released CANUCS lensing cluster fields, we revisit the Pop III UV luminosity function and estimate the Pop III cosmic star-formation rate density to be $\\approx[10^{-6}$--$10^{-4}]$~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$~cMpc$^{-3}$ at $z\\simeq6$--7, falling in the range of current theoretical predictions.",

Using Zwicky Transient Facility light curves, we measure fractional variability ($F_{\\rm var}$) and rest-frame structure functions (SFs) to test whether short-term jet-linked variability is reflected in long-term behaviour. $\\gamma$-ray detected RL-NLSy1s and HPQs show steeply rising SFs, revealing strong long-term coherence despite modest $F_{\\rm var}$, consistent with Doppler-boosted synchrotron emission from relativistic jets. Non-jetted RL-NLSy1s exhibit the highest $F_{\\rm var}$ but plateauing SFs, indicative of stochastic, disc-driven fluctuations lacking long-term coherence. $\\gamma$-ray undetected RL-NLSy1s show the lowest $F_{\\rm var}$ and nearly flat SFs, consistent with weak or absent jet activity across all timescales. Colour-magnitude trends show that jet-dominated sources exhibit redder-when-brighter behaviour, whereas disc-dominated systems exhibit bluer-when-brighter trends. These results show that SF-derived temporal coherence, rather than variability amplitude alone, is a promising diagnostic of jet dominance and orientation, offering a framework for interpreting AGN variability in forthcoming time-domain surveys.",

Masui, Kenzie Nimmo, Ue-Li Pen, Mawson Sammons High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a $\\sim$ millisecond-long transient phenomenon that propagate across extragalactic distances and are effectively a point source. Radio wave propagation through inhomogeneous distributions of plasma can act as a lens, generating multiple images of the emitted electric field. A lens can produce images of a point source where the phase of the electric field between images remains coherent when observed by a radio telescope. FRB 20220413B shows a complicated pulse structure with time separated components that may be image copies of the main components due to plasma lensing. We perform several analyses to determine if FRB 20220413B is consistent with expectations of a plasma lensed FRB. We analyze and fit the morphology of the burst to a plasma lens model and find consistency in the spectro-temporal profile but not the observed flux. Using the complex-valued channelized voltage data from the CHIME telescope, we perform a time-lag correlation analysis and report correlation signatures present in the electric field of FRB 20220413B. We find that there exists an excess correlation signature only in absolute power and not in phase. We perform a frequency-lag correlation analysis on the spectra of all subcomponents of the burst and find a consistent scintillation bandwidth across all components. We find the scintillation bandwidth is consistent with expectations of scattering due to the Milky Way. We interpret this as all burst components propagating through the same scintillation screen located in the Milky Way, which would generate the excess variance signature observed, even in the absence of phase coherence between burst components. We find that while the burst morphology can be modeled by a plasma lens, the coherent signature present in the time-lag correlation is consistent with the expectations of a common scattering screen, but not coherent plasma lensing.",

Taylor, Cayenne Matt, Kayhan Gultekin High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) By inferring the gravitational wave background (GWB) from a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) enable the study of massive black holes. In many ways, PTAs manifest the promise of a multimessenger approach to astronomy: they can constrain SMBHB population characteristics that are otherwise difficult to constrain using electromagnetic observations, such as hardening mechanisms at sub-parsec separations. In this work, we quantify this multimessenger promise using Bayesian inference of many realizations of simulated PTA data, while adopting a model for the SMBHBs that has been successfully applied to the 15-year data set of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav). Our analyses of 200 realistic, simulated NANOGrav data sets show that there is a greater than 50\\% chance of reducing the prior uncertainty in the SMBHB hardening rate by more than 50\\%, and in the SMBHB evolutionary lifetime by 25--75\\%. Additionally, there is an 88\\% chance that PTA data can reduce the prior uncertainty in the characteristic mass variable of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) by 25--50\\%. For $M_{\\text{BH}}$--$M_{\\text{Bulge}}$ parameters (in a model without redshift evolution) and the overall normalization parameter of the GSMF, PTA data can provide only marginal information gain beyond the constraints from electromagnetic observations. Our work delineates the domains over which electromagnetic and gravitational-wave data constrain the demographics and dynamics of the supermassive black-hole binary population, offering a clearer picture of the impact of population multi-messenger astrophysics probes with PTAs.",

Steiner, Richard O'Shaughnessy To be submitted to the Astrophysical Journal; contains 17 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We construct a combined model to incorporate neutron star (NS) mass measurements with electromagnetic mass-radius constraints and gravitational-wave observations using Bayesian inference. We use different mass distributions for three populations depending on the companion stars: double neutron stars, NS - white dwarfs, and low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). To observe the effects of different parametrizations, we use two equation of state (EoS) models: a piecewise polytrope and a fixed sound-speed model at high densities in combination with a low-density EoS. Our results show that the mass distributions of these NS populations are distinct and sensitive to the EoS prior choices. In addition, using a uniform prior on the observable NS maximum mass rather than a nuisance parameter from the unknown high-density EoS, shifts the posterior maximum mass to larger values. For polytrope-like EoSs, the maximum mass posterior shifts from $M_\\mathrm{max}=2.09_{-0.07}^{+0.18} M_\\odot$ to $2.15_{-0.10}^{+0.19} M_\\odot$ at the 90% confidence level.

In the literature, the PBH merger rate is calculated analytically, assuming that PBH binaries stay in isolation (i.e. are unperturbed) and evolve solely via GW emission during their entire lifetime. However, if some or all of dark matter consists of PBHs, then as cosmic structures grow, PBH binaries and single PBHs fall inside dark matter halos. In those halos, the PBH binaries' interactions with their environment significantly affect the subsequent evolution of their orbital properties. In this paper, we present a numerical framework that accurately calculates the total PBH merger rate by combining the evolution of isolated binaries outside halos with the dynamics of binaries inside halos. In our work we have found that the isolated binary channel is suppressed at low redshifts and dynamical interactions in halos reshape the merger rate evolution with time, accelerating some mergers. At redshifts of $\\lesssim 2$ the total merger rate is a factor of $\\simeq 50 \\%$ higher than the results assuming that all PBH binaries effectively stay unperturbed until their merger. Our simulations provide a definitive calculation on the total PBH merger rates, that are currently being probed and constrained from gravitational-wave observations. We make our merger rates publicly available at Zenodo",

A total of 1130 bursts were identified, making this the largest magnetar burst catalog to date. The sample is dominated by SGR 1935+2154, which contributes 76% of all detected bursts. We analyzed burst durations, spectral properties, and their correlations across multiple sources. Bursts from SGR 1935+2154 exhibit significantly longer durations, with a mean of 317 ms, compared to a mean of 23 ms for bursts from other magnetars. Two microsecond-scale bursts were detected for the first time, originating from 1E 1048.1-5937 and CXOU J010043.1-721134. Spectral analysis in the 0.5--8 keV range using both blackbody and power-law models shows that bursts with higher fluences have harder spectra. In contrast, correlations between burst duration and spectral parameters are weak or absent. This catalog provides a valuable dataset for studying magnetar short bursts, enabling future modeling efforts and improving our understanding of the diversity and physical mechanisms of magnetar bursts.",

R. Kulkarni, Jean Somalwar, Ryan Chornock, Ilfan Bikmaev, Mark A. Gorbachev High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We select seventy tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates among X-ray transients discovered during the eROSITA all-sky surveys in the Eastern Galactic hemisphere between December 2020 and February 2022 (eRASS1--5). We cross-match each X-ray source to a host galaxy in archival optical surveys using Bayesian likelihood-ratio techniques and obtain Keck/LRIS spectroscopy for all 70 host galaxies. Host properties are inferred through SED fitting with Prospector and emission line analysis with pPXF. We develop a robust classification scheme using X-ray and broad line luminosities, narrow-line ionization diagnostics, and optical variability to identify high-confidence TDEs, for which we analyze optical spectral features, light curve properties, and host galaxy demographics. Our final sample contains 52 TDEs with redshifts of $0.018 \\leq z\\leq0.714$, comprising 41 gold (high-confidence) and 11 silver (lower-confidence) events. The vast majority (93\\%) of gold TDEs are intrinsically brighter in the X-ray band, with $L_{\\rm X,peak} > L_{\\rm opt,peak}$.

Host galaxy demographics reveal modest over-representation in green valley ($\\times1.8$) and quiescent Balmer-strong ($\\times5.3$) galaxies, significantly weaker than previous TDE samples, demonstrating greater diversity in star formation histories than previously recognized.

Submitted to Phys. Rev. D High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) The indirect ground-based observations of cosmic rays through extensive air showers in modern experiments typically involve the use of Monte Carlo simulations to determine the characteristics of the primary particles. These simulations necessitate assumptions about particle interactions at energies that have not yet been experimentally probed, which introduces systematic uncertainties in key observables, particularly the number of muons. Current research on this uncertainty primarily focuses on hadronic interaction models, the dominant source of muon production. This study presents an approach that takes into account another significant mechanism for muon generation: photonuclear reactions. A robust heuristic technique has been developed to estimate the contribution of these interactions to the total number of muons over a wide range of extensive air shower parameters (including primary particle type, energy, and slant atmospheric depth) and photonuclear interaction models, with an absolute percentage error on the order of $10\\%$ in the estimated number of muons. Furthermore, several potential applications of the suggested method in relation to modern challenges in extensive air shower physics are discussed.",

Accretion solutions that involve the formation of shocks are particularly intriguing, as they are expected to naturally produce observable variability features. However, despite their theoretical significance, time-dependent studies exploring the stability and evolution of such shocked solutions remain relatively scarce. To address this gap, we perform simulations of transonic accretion flows around a black hole in ideal magneto-hydrodynamic framework. Our simulations are initialized using boundary conditions derived from semi-analytical hydrodynamical models, allowing us to explore the stability of these flows under varying magnetic field strengths. The presence of magnetic fields modifies the dynamics of the accretion flow through magnetic pressure, and the resulting force imbalance induces oscillations in the position of shock front. Our results show that variations in the emitted luminosity arising from shock oscillations appear as quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), a characteristic feature commonly observed in accreting black holes. We find that the QPO frequency is determined by the radial position of the shock front: oscillations occurring closer to the black hole produce frequencies of tens of hertz, whereas shocks located farther out yield sub-hertz frequencies",

We identify flares in 24 sources in M31, 5 in M81, and 26 in Cen~A; several display recurrent events. Flare durations span from tens of seconds to a few $10^{4}$ s, with peak luminosities of $10^{37}$-$10^{40}\\ \\mathrm{erg\\ s^{-1}}$ and low flare duty cycles of $4.9\\times10^{-6}$-$3.5\\times10^{-2}$. Dipping events are found in 8 sources in M31, 1 in M81, and 5 in Cen A, including two repeaters. On multi-epoch baselines, the standard deviation of the source luminosity correlates linearly with the mean luminosity, with a coefficient of 0.49 (M31), 0.30 (M81), and 0.67 (Cen A), indicating galaxy-to-galaxy diversity. No statistically significant periodic signals are detected in M81 or Cen A, which, along with several periodic signals previously found among the M31 sources, can be understood considering a joint effect of our detection sensitivity and intrinsic distributions of the orbital period and X-ray luminosity of LMXBs. The ensemble of short-duty-cycle flares, a mix of recurrent and isolated dips, and galaxy-dependent rms--flux factor, supports a picture in which stochastic accretion-rate fluctuations modulate luminosity on $\\sim$10-$10^{4}$ s. Conducted at known distances and across distinct host environments, this extragalactic survey provides uniform flare/dip samples and rms-flux scalings for bulge-dominated fields, offering empirical constraints for accretion physics and illustrating the promise of timing analyses in external galaxies using the Chandra archive.",

Submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Shear flows, ubiquitous in space and astrophysical plasmas, can accelerate particles through turbulence excited by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We present the first numerical study of particle acceleration in non-relativistic, magnetized, and purely shear-driven turbulence that includes full particle backreaction. Using two-dimensional MHD-PIC simulations with an initially uniform flow-aligned magnetic field and external stirring force, we demonstrate that sustained particle acceleration requires continuously driven turbulence, whereas freely decaying turbulence rapidly depletes its energy reservoirs and halts the acceleration. The acceleration mechanism operates through the systematic distortion of gyro-orbits by turbulent electric fields: acceleration phases extend the particle trajectory along the electric force, increasing the energy gain, while deceleration phases shorten the trajectory, reducing the energy loss. This asymmetry produces net energy gain despite stochastic fluctuations, with the mean energy change scaling quadratically with shear velocity, characteristic of second-order Fermi acceleration. Initially monoenergetic particles develop substantial non-thermal tails after the turbulence onset. For particles repeatedly crossing shear layers, their energization follows geometric Brownian motion with weak systematic drift, yielding a log-normal distribution. High-energy particles exhibit pitch-angle anisotropy, becoming preferentially perpendicular to the flow-aligned magnetic field as their gyroradii exceed the turbulent layer width. These results establish shear-driven turbulence as a viable particle acceleration mechanism, providing a general model for particle energization in shear flows.",

Code available at this https URL High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present a new non-relativistic reflection model, DAO, designed to calculate reflection spectra in the rest frame of accretion disks in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei. The model couples the XSTAR code, which treats atomic processes, with the Feautrier method for solving the radiative transfer equation. A key feature of DAO is the incorporation of a high-temperature corrected cross section and an exact redistribution function to accurately treat Compton scattering. Furthermore, the model accommodates arbitrary illuminating spectra, enabling applications across diverse physical conditions. We investigate the spectral dependence on key physical parameters and benchmark the results against the widely used reflionx and xillver codes.",

To further explore this conclusion, we perform a suite of idealized, controlled simulations targeting the relative roles of merger-induced sloshing and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. Our models systematically isolate and combine these mechanisms to predict observable velocity profiles and X-ray line shapes, providing direct comparison to XRISM and Hitomi data. We find that neither sloshing nor AGN activity alone can reproduce the observed velocity dispersion profile; only their combined action matches the elevated dispersions both at the cluster core and outskirts. Power-spectrum analysis reveals distinct spatial signatures: sloshing generates large-scale coherent motions, while AGN feedback injects turbulence and broadens the velocity spectrum at small scales, especially in the core. By forward-modeling spectral line profiles, we show how these dynamics imprint unique observational signatures on X-ray emission. Our results underscore the necessity of accounting for both large-scale and small-scale drivers of gas motions in the ICM when interpreting high-resolution spectroscopic data, and provide guidance for the analysis of forthcoming XRISM observations.",

These pulsars, discovered in 18 new pointings with 2\\,hour integration times, bring the total number of pulsars identified by this ongoing survey to 19 (yielding a total of 44 LMC radio pulsars now known), representing an 80 per cent increase in the LMC radio pulsar population to date. These include PSR\\,J0454$-$6927, the slowest extragalactic radio pulsar discovered to date, with a spin period of 2238\\,ms, and PSR\\,J0452$-$6921, which exhibits the highest dispersion measure (DM) among extragalactic radio pulsars, at 326\\,pc\\,cm$^{-3}$. The fastest spin period among the new discoveries is 245\\,ms, and the lowest DM is 62\\,pc\\,cm$^{-3}$. We also present timing results for our first pulsar discoveries with MeerKAT and the Murriyang radio telescope, obtaining phase-connected solutions for seven pulsars in the LMC. These results indicate that the pulsars are isolated, canonical radio pulsars with characteristic ages up to 8.8\\,Myr",

We find the polarization degree of $ 21.2 \\pm 0.4 \\% $ and polarization angle of $ 92.2 \\pm 0.5^\\circ $, well compatible with the first hard-state IXPE observation in 2022. As the observed polarization depends on both the accretion geometry and the X-ray emission mechanism, which we attribute to reflection from the optically thick envelope surrounding the central source, our result indicates that both are very stable on year-long timescale. We discuss time- and energy-dependent polarization properties and their implications for the geometry and stability of the accretion funnel.",

Davis, Yan-fei Jiang 18 figures, comments are welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The early time emission in tidal disruption events (TDEs) originates from both accretion and shocks, which produce photons that eventually emerge from an inhomogeneous photosphere. In this work, we model the disk formation following the debris stream self-intersection in a TDE. We track the multi-band emission using three-dimensional, frequency-integrated and multi-group radiation hydrodynamic simulations. We find a more circularized disk forms about 24 days following the initial stream-stream collision, after the mass fallback rate peaks and once the debris stream density decreases. Despite the absence of a circularized disk at early times, various shocks and the asymmetric photosphere are sufficient to drive a wide range of optical-to-X-ray ratios and soft-X-ray variability. We find that with strong apsidal precession, the first light is from the stream-stream collision. It launches an optically-thick outflow, but only produces modest prompt emission. The subsequent optical and ultraviolet (UV) light curve rise is mainly powered by shocks in the turbulent accretion flow close to the black hole. The optical-UV luminosity peaks roughly when the disk forms and shock-driven outflows subside. The disk is optically and geometrically thick, extending well beyond the circularization radius. Radiation pressure clears the polar region and leaves optically-thin channels. We obtain the broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) directly from multi-group simulations with 16-20 frequency groups. The SED has a black body component that peaks in the extreme UV. The soft X-ray component either resembles a thermal tail, or can be described by a shallower power law associated with bulk Compton scattering. The blackbody parameters are broadly consistent with observed optical TDEs and vary weakly with viewing angle. In contrast, soft X-ray emission is highly angle-dependent.",

Most FRB sources are detected only once, while some are repeaters. Variation patterns observed in the rotation measure (RM) of some repeaters -- indicate that the local magneto-ionic environments of these FRB sources are highly dynamic. It has been suggested that a Be star-magnetar binary system is a possible origin for such variation. FRB 20201124A is notable among these sources since it is the most active one and exhibits substantial temporal variations of RM measured by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The physics behind this long-term behavior is poorly understood. Here we propose that, within the framework of the Be star-magnetar binary scenario, the observed variation of RM is attributed to a combination of orbital motion and the precession of the circumstellar disk of the Be star. While a ~785-day precession of the disk contributes to the observed decrease in the amplitude of the variation, our model predicts that the amplitude oscillates with this period.",

Accepted for publication in A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) MAXI J1957+032 is an accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar that shows brief, recurrent outbursts in an ultra-compact ~1 h orbit. We characterise the 2025 outburst using X-ray timing and spectroscopy from XMM-Newton and Swift (and a late-time NuSTAR observation), together with contemporaneous optical photometry from LCO, and compare the spin frequency with the 2022 outburst. Timing searches detect coherent pulsations at ~313.6 Hz with no measurable frequency derivative during the XMM-Newton exposure. Relative to its 2022 outburst, we measure a long-term spin-down of ~-2x10^-14 Hz s^-1, consistent with magnetic-dipole braking in quiescence. The pulse profile is nearly sinusoidal, with significant power at the fundamental, second, and fifth harmonics; the fractional amplitude decreases with increasing flux and shows soft lags up to a few keV. The 0.5-10 keV spectrum is well described by absorbed thermal Comptonisation (photon index ~2.4) plus a cool blackbody (kT ~0.23 keV) consistent with emission from a surface hotspot; no reflection or Fe-line features are detected. Requiring R_m \\leq R_co implies B_s ~(0.5-3)x10^8 G for d=(5 \\pm 2) kpc and {\\xi}=0.3-0.5, below the upper limit from the secular spin-down (B_p \\leq 10^9 G), possibly indicating a mildly leaky propeller. The optical emission lies on the neutron-star branch of the L_OIR-L_X relation, consistent with reprocessing in a compact disc. The optical SEDs are broadly flat, while an early red excess suggests a transient jet contribution during the initial hard X-ray phase; an optical peak delayed relative to the X-rays may trace an outward-propagating heating front and rapid disc evolution in these short-lived outbursts.",

Xavier Prochaska 39 pages, 18 figures, 7 Tables, Under Review at JHEAP High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most luminous explosions in the Universe and serve as powerful probes of the early cosmos. However, the rapid fading of their afterglows and the scarcity of spectroscopic measurements make photometric classification crucial for timely high-redshift identification. We present an ensemble machine learning framework for redshift classification of GRBs based solely on their optical plateau and prompt emission properties. Our dataset comprises 171 long GRBs observed by the Swift UVOT and more than 450 ground-based telescopes. The analysis pipeline integrates robust statistical techniques, including M-estimator outlier rejection, multivariate imputation using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations, and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator feature selection, followed by a SuperLearner ensemble combining parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric algorithms. The optimal model, trained on raw optical data with outlier removal at a redshift threshold of z equals 2.0, achieves a true positive rate of 74 percent and an area under the curve of 0.84, maintaining balanced generalization between training and test sets. At higher thresholds, such as z equals 3.0, the classifier sustains strong discriminative power with an area under the curve of 0.88. Validation on an independent GRB sample yields 97 percent overall accuracy, perfect specificity, and an ensemble area under the curve of 0.93. Compared to previous prompt- and X-ray-based classifiers, our optical framework offers enhanced sensitivity to high-redshift events, improved robustness against data incompleteness, and greater applicability to ground-based follow-up. We also publicly release a web application that enables real-time redshift classification, facilitating rapid identification of candidate high-redshift GRBs for cosmological studies.",

Specifically, the two QPO types were detected simultaneously but exhibited distinct energy dependencies: the type-C QPO was dominant in the hard X-ray band (10-30 keV), while the type-B QPO was more prominent in the soft X-ray band (1-10 keV). Further analysis reveals that the emergence of the type-C QPO suppresses the strength of the type-B QPO, particularly above 10 keV. Tracking the detailed evolution of these QPOs, we find that the weakening of the type-B QPO coincides with the strengthening of the type-C QPO, indicating a competitive interaction between them. These findings reveal a more complex relationship between type-B and type-C QPOs than previously recognized, suggesting they originate from distinct but interacting physical components within the accretion flow and/or jet, and providing new insights into the dynamics of accretion state transitions.",

One of these is the subject of the present study, namely, an explanation of the recently discovered spectral hardening at $\\sim 300$ GeV with self-consistently treated cosmic-ray diffusion, where self-generated waves resulting from the streaming instability impact the diffusion of high-energy particles. We revisit the corresponding model by Blasi et al. (2012), perform an extensive parameter study, and determine an optimal range of parameters that best fit the cosmic-ray data.

These sBBHs can retain detectable eccentricities when they enter the sensitivity bands of low-frequency GW observatories. We study multiband GW observations of eccentric sBBHs that escape from GC models simulated with the MOCCA code, focusing on how low- and middle-frequency detectors can constrain their eccentricities and other parameters. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we generate ten realizations of cosmic sBBHs by combining the MOCCA sample with a cosmological model for GC formation and evolution. We then assess their detectability and the precision of parameter estimation. Our results show that LISA, Taiji, the LISA-Taiji network (LT), and AMIGO could detect $0.8\\pm0.7$, $11.6\\pm2.0$, $15.4\\pm2.7$, and $7.9\\pm1.3$ escaping sBBHs, respectively, over four years, while LT-AMIGO could detect $20.6\\pm3.0$ multiband sBBHs in the same period. LT and AMIGO can measure initial eccentricities with relative errors of approximately $10^{-6}-2\\times10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}-0.7$, respectively. Joint LT-AMIGO observations have a similar ability to estimate eccentricities as LT alone.",

This candidate implies an exceptionally large $J$-factor of $\\sim 10^{23}\\,{\\rm GeV^2\\,cm^{-5}}$, exceeding that of known classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies by orders of magnitude and rivaling the Galactic Center. In this work, we utilize more than 17 years of $\\textit{Fermi}$-LAT data to search for gamma-ray emission from this subhalo. We identify a tentative excess in the region with ambiguous origin. Adopting a conservative strategy, we retain this excess without modeling additional astrophysical components, treating it instead as unmodeled background to derive upper limits on the dark matter annihilation cross-section for the $b\\bar{b}$ and $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ channels. Despite this conservative treatment, the resulting limits remain stringent due to the exceptionally large $J$-factor. Subject to the dynamical confirmation of the subhalo, these constraints are potentially orders of magnitude stronger than those obtained from combined analyses of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and blind subhalo searches.",

Skene, Rainer Hollerbach 33 pages, 36 figures, submitted to ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn) Magnetic field evolution in neutron star cores is not fully understood. We describe the field evolution both for one barotropic fluid as well as two collisionally coupled barotropic fluids with different density profiles using the anelastic approximation and the Navier-Stokes equations to simulate the evolution in three dimensions. In the one-fluid case, a single fluid describes the motion of the charged particles. In the two-fluid model, the neutral fluid is coupled to the electrically conductive fluid by collisions, the latter being dragged by the magnetic field. In this model, both fluids have distinct density profiles. This forces them to move at slightly different velocities, resulting in a relative motion between the two barotropic fluids -- ambipolar diffusion. We develop a code based on Dedalus and study the evolution of simple poloidal dipolar and toroidal magnetic fields. Previous 2D studies found that poloidal magnetic fields evolve towards a stable Grad-Shafranov equilibrium. In our 3D simulations we find an instability of the two-fluid system similar to the one in the barotropic fluid system. After the instability saturates, a highly non-linear Lorentz force introduces small-scale fluid motion that leads to turbulence, development of a cascade and significant, non-axially symmetric changes in the magnetic field configuration. Fluid viscosity plays an essential role in regularizing the small-scale fluid motion, providing an energy drain.",

García, S. del Palacio High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Pulsar glitches are unresolved increments of the rotation rate that sometimes trigger an enhancement of the spin-down rate. On occasions, the augmented spin-down decays gradually in an exponential manner, particularly after the largest glitch events. The young pulsar PSR J0537-6910 exhibits the highest known glitching rate, with 60 events detected in nearly 18 years of monitoring. Despite most PSR J0537-6910 glitches being large, only one exponential recovery has been reported, following its first discovered glitch. This is puzzling, as pulsars of similar characteristics typically present significant exponential recoveries. We aim to determine whether this reflects an intrinsic difference in PSR J0537-6910 or a detectability issue, for example due to its high glitch frequency. The full dataset, including recent NICER observations, was systematically searched for exponential relaxations. Each glitch was tested for evidence of a recovery over a broad range of trial timescales. Promising candidates were investigated further by comparing recovery models with and without an exponential term using Bayesian evidence. We discovered six new glitches, bringing the total to 66. Our criteria strongly indicates the presence of 11 previously undetected exponential recoveries. We presente updated glitch and timing solutions. Exponential recoveries are detected only for the largest glitches, though not all of them. The inferred timescales range from 4 to 37 d, with the decaying frequency increment generally below $1\\%$ of the total. We find that $\\ddot\\nu$ can remain stable across several glitches, with persistent changes associated with only some events. In particular, it tends to be lowest after glitches with exponential recoveries, yielding inter-glitch braking indices between 6 and 9. Following glitches without recoveries, $\\ddot\\nu$ is higher, leading to braking indices between 10 and 35.",

These pulsars were initially discovered through their single-pulse emission and therefore designated as rotating radio transients (RRATs). Follow-up timing campaigns yielded a number of higher signal-to-noise summed pulse profiles for each pulsar, allowing us to obtain timing solutions both through single pulses as well as the standard method of time-integrating the pulsar's emission. We find that the two methods return timing parameters which are usually in agreement within two standard deviations, and have similar sized error bars. The single-pulse timing solutions have significantly higher RMS errors and reduced chi-squared values, likely due to pulse jitter. The distribution of wait times between detected single pulses indicates a significant amount of pulse clustering in time on short timescales from all three sources. For all sources, the presence of low-level emission outside of the sparse bright pulses and lack of giant pulses is more reminiscent of highly nulling canonical radio pulsars than extremely transient RRATs, highlighting the diversity of emission behavior observed from sources published as RRATs.",

In this paper, we develop self-consistent leptonic, hadronic, and leptohadronic models that reproduce both the observed spectrum and morphology of the source. Purely leptonic models are energetically more favorable yet they require rather specific morphological assumptions. The gamma-ray morphology of the source can be better explained within a hadronic scenario based on the identification of cold gas structures spatially correlated with the observed gamma-ray emission. However, a purely hadronic model for the source emission requires a substantial energy reservoir in protons and fails to reproduce the extended X-ray emission recently detected by XRISM. We show that emission including a combination of leptonic and hadronic components can reproduce both the spectral and morphological properties of the source. We provide predictions for the X-ray and neutrino spectra of~the~nebula that can discriminate the hadronic and leptonic contributions to the overall source signal.",

Comments welcome Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Circumbinary disks crucially affect the orbital and electromagnetic properties of binary systems across the universe, from stars in our galactic neighborhood to supermassive black hole binaries formed as the result of tumultuous galactic mergers. Previous simulations have focused nearly exclusively on thick accretion disks, appropriate for studying stellar binaries, and have found encouraging agreement with observations thereof. We present herein the first systematic study of eccentric binary systems accreting from thin disks, focusing on binary orbital evolution. Our main results are that (1) thinner disk not only drive binaries to rapidly inspiral, but also excite binary eccentricities at much higher rates; (2) while thick disks may drive binaries to a stable fixed point of $e\\approx0.425$, thinner disks pump binary eccentricities to $e\\gtrsim0.6$; (3) the range of near-zero eccentricities that are damped towards zero depends on both disk thickness and viscosity, thinner disks and those with $\\alpha$ viscosities driving binaries towards circularity over a much narrower range of eccentricities. These differences follow largely from the effects of pressure support on accretion streams and shocks within the inner regions of the accretion flow. Our results suggest that accreting binary black holes should have high eccentricities well into the frequency range probed by pulsar timing arrays and space-based gravitational wave interferometers, affecting the spectrum and isotropy of the gravitational wave background. Our results also suggest that circumbinary disks may play an important role in shaping the orbits of close binary stars, but much less so those of wider binaries.",

The workflows for discovering and classifying transients in survey data streams have become increasingly automated over decades of development. The recent integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence tools has produced major milestones, including the fully automated end-to-end discovery and classification of an optical transient, and has enabled automated rapid-response space-based follow-up. The now-operational Vera C. Rubin Observatory and its Legacy Survey of Space and Time are accelerating the rate of transient discovery and producing large volumes of data at incredible rates. Given the expected order-of-magnitude increase in transient discoveries, one promising path forwards for optical time-domain astronomy is heavily investing in accelerating the automation of our workflows. Here we review the current paradigm of real-time transient workflows, project their evolution during the Rubin era and present recommendations for accelerating transient astronomy with automation.",

However, physical characteristics of these transients (e.g. energy and temperature) and their spectra remain ill-constrained due to limitations in cadence and magnitude access of current spectroscopic facilities.

Accepted for publication in ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Common envelope evolution is a critical but still poorly understood phase in binary evolution. It plays a key role in forming close binaries such as hot subdwarfs, double white dwarfs, X-ray binaries, and double neutron stars. However, its outcomes remain highly uncertain. Depending on the efficiency of envelope ejection, a system may either survive as a close binary or undergo a complete merger. In this work, we investigate the post merger evolution of systems where a CO WD mergers with the core of an AGB star. A grid of merger remnant models with various core and envelope masses is constructed. At the onset of evolution, the CO core contracts and undergoes off-center carbon ignition, producing an inwardly propagating carbon flame. For remnants with relatively low mass of CO core, the flame phase is followed by core contraction and subsequent H-shell burning. For more massive CO cores, the carbon flame reaches the center and is soon followed by off-center neon burning, which is expected to eventually lead to core-collapse supernovae. The merger remnants occupy nearly the same region on HR diagram as ordinary AGB or super-AGB stars, exhibiting similar surface properties. Although their surface abundance may differ slightly from those of normal AGB stars depending on the initial core and envelope masses, these differences are strongly reduced once mass-loss is taken into account. We suggest that some giant-like stars, including candidates for Thorne-Zytkow objects (e.g., HV 2112), might alternatively be explained as AGB-WD merger remnants.",

The Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time will be capable of discovering thousands of TDEs each year, allowing for a dramatic increase in the number of discovered TDEs. The optical light curves from TDEs can be used to model the physical parameters of the black hole and disrupted star, but the sampling and photometric uncertainty of the real data will couple with model degeneracies to limit our ability to recover these parameters. In this work, we aim to model the impact of the Rubin survey strategy on simulated TDE light curves to quantify the typical errors in the recovered parameters. Black hole masses $5.5< \\log M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\odot < 8.2$ can be recovered with typical errors of 0.26 dex, with early coverage removing large outliers. Recovery of the mass of the disrupted star is difficult, limited by the degeneracy with the accretion efficiency. Only 57\\% of the cases have accurate recovery of whether the events are full or partial, so we caution the use this method to assess whether TDEs are partially or fully disrupted systems. Black hole mass measurements obtained from Rubin observations of TDEs will provide powerful constraints on the black hole mass function, black hole -- galaxy co-evolution, and the population of black hole spins, though continued work to understand the origin of TDE observables and how the TDE rate varies among galaxies will be necessarily to fully utilize the upcoming rich data set from Rubin.",

The rapid variability observed in the X-ray signal from accreting black holes provides a powerful diagnostic to indirectly map the ultra-compact region in the vicinity of the black hole horizon. X-ray reverberation mapping exploits the light crossing delay between X-rays that reach us directly from the hard X-ray emitting 'corona', and those that first reflect off the accretion disc. Here we build upon a previous reverberation mass measurement of Cygnus X-1 that used the RELTRANS software package. Our new analysis enhances signal to noise with an improved treatment of the statistics, and implements new RELTRANS models that are sensitive to distance. The reduced uncertainties uncover evidence of mass accretion rate variability in the inner region of the disc that propagates towards the corona, which we approximate as a point-like 'lamppost' source. Our best fitting model returns a mass of $M=15\\pm 4 ~M_\\odot$ and a distance of $D=3.4_{-1.2}^{+1.6}$ kpc (90 per cent uncertainties), which are consistent with the most recent dynamical and parallax measurements respectively.",

Fragile 10 pages, 6 figures, A&A accepted High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Orbiting matter misaligned with a spinning black hole undergoes Lense-Thirring precession, due to the frame-dragging effect. This phenomenon is particularly relevant for type-C QPOs observed in the hard states of low-mass X-ray binaries. However, the accretion flow in these hard states is complex, consisting of a geometrically thick, hot corona surrounded by a geometrically thin, cold disk. Recent simulations have demonstrated that, in such a truncated disk scenario, the precession of the inner hot corona slows due to its interaction with the outer cold disk. This paper aims to provide an analytical description of the precession of an inner (hot) torus in the presence of accretion torques exerted by the outer (cold) disk. Using the angular momentum conservation equation, we investigate the evolution of the torus angular momentum vector for various models of accretion torque. We find that, in general, an accretion torque tilts the axis of precession away from the black hole spin axis. In all models, if the accretion torque is sufficiently strong, it can halt the precession; any perturbation from this stalled state will cause the torus to precess around an axis that is misaligned with the black hole spin axis. The accretion torque exerted by the outer thin disk can cause precession around an axis that is neither aligned with the black hole spin axis nor perpendicular to the plane of the disk. This finding may have significant observational implications, as the jet direction, if aligned with the angular momentum axis of the torus, may no longer reliably indicate the black hole spin axis or the orientation of the outer accretion disk",

The X-ray spectra corresponding to all objects are well-fitted with a power-law spectral model, and a strong \"redder-when-brighter\" trend is seen, which is mostly seen in Blazars. The X-ray light curves were produced for all the available observations, and the F$_{var}$ is estimated. In 1H 0323+342, we found that F$_{var}$ lies between 9$\\%$ to 22$\\%$, suggesting significant variability in the source. Similarly, for PKS 2004-447, we found F$_{var}$ lies between 10$\\%$ to 21$\\%$. We see a strong X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray spectral index correlation among these objects, suggesting that these are produced through a similar process. Comparing the X-ray spectral index with other class objects, we see that NLSy1 galaxies are similar to LBL and IBL types. We see a negative trend of X-ray flux with the $\\gamma$-ray luminosity in these objects, suggesting an anti-correlation between them. A similar trend is seen between the X-ray flux, total jet power, and disk luminosity. The X-ray spectral index also shows a negative trend with total jet power and disk luminosity. The optical variability amplitude (in magnitude) lies between 0.90 to 2.32, and the fractional variability varies from 13\\% to 40\\%. The color-magnitude plot shows mostly the redder-when-brighter (RWB) trend, suggesting $\\gamma$-NLSy1 are much closer to FSRQs than BL Lacs.

Zdziarski, Gregoire Marcel, Alexandra Veledina, Aleksandra Olejak, Debora Lancova Resubmitted to New Astronomy Review High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We review current challenges in understanding the values and origin of the spins of black holes in binaries. Thanks to recent advances in astrophysical instrumentation, the spins can now be measured using both gravitational waves emitted by merging black holes and electromagnetic radiation from accreting X-ray binaries containing black holes. A key finding of the gravitational-wave observatories is that premerger black holes in binaries have low spin values, with an average dimensionless spin parameter of $a_*\\sim$0.1--0.2, with 90\\% having $a_*\\lesssim 0.6$. This implies that the natal spins of black holes are generally low, and the angular momentum transport in massive stars is efficient. On the other hand, most of the published spins in X-ray binaries are very high. In particular, this is the case for binaries with high-mass donors (potential progenitors of mergers), where their published spins range from 0.8 to 1.0. At the same time, their short lifetimes prevent significant spin-up by accretion. Those with low-mass donors could be spun-up to $a_*\\gtrsim 0.7$ by accretion only if the donor initial masses were more than several solar masses, which remains unproven. However, the existing methods of spin measurements suffer from significant systematic errors. The method relying on relativistic X-ray line broadening is based on the separation of the observed spectra into incident and reflected ones, which is highly uncertain. The method relying on spectral fitting of accretion disk continua uses models that predict the disk to be highly unstable, while stability is observed. Improved stable models predict lower spins. The published spin measurements in X-ray binaries are uncertain. The spins of the binaries with high-mass donors may be low, while those with low-mass donors have a broader spin distribution, ranging from low to high.",

However, the emitted spectrum from a GRB photosphere, which includes prior dissipation of energy by radiation-mediated shocks (RMSs), can also produce such spectral features. Here, we analyze the bright GRB 211211A using the Kompaneets RMS Approximation (KRA). We find that the KRA can fit the time-resolved spectra well, significantly better than the traditionally used Band function in all studied time bins. The analysis of GRB 211211A reveals a jet with a typical Lorentz factor ($\\Gamma \\sim 300$), and a strong RMS (upstream dimensionless specific momentum, $\\gamma_u \\beta_u \\sim 3$) occurring at a moderate optical depth ($\\tau \\sim 35$) in a relatively cold upstream ($\\theta_u = k_{\\rm B} T_u / m_e c^2 \\sim 10^{-4}$). We conclude that broad GRB spectra that exhibit two breaks can also be well explained by photospheric emission. This implies that, {in such cases}, the spectral shape in the MeV-band alone is not enough to determine the emission mechanism during the prompt phase in GRBs.",

Published in A&A (this https URL) A&A, Volume 704, December 2025, A135 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Identifying the progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae (Type Ia supernovae; SNe Ia) remains a key objective in contemporary astronomy. The rare subclass of SNe Ia that interacts with circumstellar material (Type Ia-CSM) allows for studies of the progenitor's environment before explosion, and generally favours single-degenerate progenitor channels. The case of SN Ia-CSM PTF11kx clearly connected thermonuclear explosions with hydrogen-rich CSM-interacting events, and the more recent SN 2020eyj connected SNe Ia with helum-rich companion progenitors. Here we present a study of SN 2020aeuh, a Type Ia-CSM with delayed interaction. We analyse photometric and spectroscopic data that monitor the evolution of SN 2020aeuh and compare its properties with those of peculiar SNe Ia and core-collapse SNe. At early times, the evolution of SN 2020aeuh resembles a slightly overluminous SN Ia. Later, the interaction-dominated spectra develop the same pseudocontinuum seen in Type Ia-CSM PTF11kx and SN 2020eyj. However, the later-time spectra of SN 2020aeuh lack hydrogen and helium narrow lines. Instead, a few narrow lines could be attributed to carbon and oxygen. We fit the pseudobolometric light curve with a CSM-interaction mode, yielding a CSM mass of 1-2 M$_{\\odot}$. We propose that SN 2020aeuh was a Type Ia supernova that eventually interacted with a dense medium which was deficient in both hydrogen and helium. Whereas previous SNe Ia-CSM constitute our best evidence for nondegenerate companion progenitors, the CSM around SN 2020aeuh is more difficult to understand. We include a hydrodynamical simulation for a double-degenerate system to showcase how the dynamical evolution of such a progenitor scenario could produce the CSM observed around SN 2020aeuh. It is clear that SN 2020aeuh challenges current models for stellar evolution leading up to a SN Ia explosion.",

Takahashi 22 pages, 9 figures, accepted by ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Central compact objects (CCOs) are a subclass of neutron stars with a dipole magnetic field strength considerably weaker than those of radio pulsars and magnetars. One possible explanation for such weak magnetic fields in the CCOs is the hidden magnetic field scenario, in which supernova fallback submerges the magnetosphere of a proto-neutron star beneath a newly formed crust. However, the fallback mass and timescale required for this submergence process remain uncertain. We perform one-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the supernova fallback onto a magnetized proto-neutron star, while considering neutrino cooling. In our simulations, the infalling material compresses the magnetic field and drives a strong shock. The shock initially expands outward, but eventually stalls and recedes as neutrino cooling becomes significant. After the shock stalls, the gas density above the magnetosphere increases rapidly, potentially leading to the formation of a new crust. To understand the shock dynamics, we develop semi-analytic models that describe the resulting magnetospheric and shock radii when the shock stalls. By comparing the fallback time scale with the shock stalling time scale, corresponding to the waiting time for the new crust formation, we derive a necessary condition for the submergence of the PNS magnetic field. Our results will provide guidance for investigating the diversity of young isolated neutron stars through multidimensional simulations.",

Sanchez Accepted for publication in MNRAS on 2025-11-21 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present an analysis of twenty tidal disruption event (TDE) host galaxies observed with the MUSE integral-field spectrograph on ESO VLT. We investigate the presence of extended emission line regions (EELRs) and study stellar populations mostly at sub-kpc scale around the host nuclei. EELRs are detected in 5/20 hosts, including two unreported systems. All EELRs are found at z<0.045, suggesting a distance bias and faint EELRs may be missed at higher redshift. EELRs only appear in post-merger systems and all such hosts at z<0.045 show them. Thus, we conclude that TDEs and galaxy mergers have a strong relation, and >45% of post-merger hosts in the sample exhibit EELRs. Furthermore, we constrained the distributions of stellar masses near the central black holes (BHs), using the spectral synthesis code Starlight and BPASS stellar evolution models. The youngest nuclear populations have typical ages of 1 Gyr and stellar masses below 2.5MSun. The populations that can produce observable TDEs around non-rotating BHs are dominated by subsolar-mass stars. 3/4 TDEs requiring larger stellar masses exhibit multi-peaked light curves, possibly implying relation to repeated partial disruptions of high-mass stars. The found distributions are in tension with the masses of the stars derived using light curve models. Mass segregation of the disrupted stars can enhance the rate of TDEs from supersolar-mass stars but our study implies that low-mass TDEs should still be abundant and even dominate the distribution, unless there is a mechanism that prohibits low-mass TDEs or their detection.",

An emerging structure in the mass distribution indicates the presence of multiple peaks around chirp masses of $8M_\\odot$, $14M_\\odot$, and $27M_\\odot$. In particular, there is a lack of observations between chirp masses of 10 and 12 $M_\\odot$. In this article, we report that observations significantly favour the model supporting suppression of the rate in a narrow chirp mass range compared to the model that doesn't include suppression at a confidence greater than 99.5\\%. Using another test, which measures the deviation between the inferred chirp mass distributions from the two models, we conservatively estimate a 95\\% confidence in the presence of a feature. A lack of confidence has been reported in the presence of a gap around a comparable location in the component mass distribution. The differing conclusions are due to a unique correlation between the primary~(heavier of the two masses) and the secondary~(lighter of the two masses) masses of binary black holes. This correlation results in increased clustering of measured chirp masses around specific values.",

The component spins are both exceptionally high ($a_1 = 0.90^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$, $a_2 = 0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.51}$), which is difficult to explain with repeated mergers. Here we show that the black hole spin vectors are closely aligned with each other while significantly tilted relative to the binary's orbital angular momentum, pointing to a common accretion-driven origin. We examine astrophysical formation channels capable of producing near-equal, high-mass, and mutually aligned spins consistent with GW231123 -- particularly binaries embedded in AGN disks and Pop~III remnants, which grew via coherent misaligned gas accretion. We further argue that other high-mass, high-spin events, e.g., GW190521 may share a similar evolutionary pathway.

A slab corona may not explain the hard state observations of X-ray binaries (XRBs). We incorporate energy feedback to the accretion disk resulting from illumination by an extended corona, and vice versa. The interaction between these two components allows for the possibility of finding an energetically self-consistent equilibrium solution for a given disk-corona system. We have upgraded the existing Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, MONK, to incorporate the interaction between the disk and the extended corona within the general relativistic framework. We introduce an albedo parameter to specify the fraction of the incident flux that is reflected by the disk, while the remainder is absorbed and added to the intrinsic dissipation. Reflection is modeled assuming a semi-infinite electron atmosphere. We find global equilibrium solutions by iterating interaction between disk and extended slab corona. A higher black hole spin, higher coronal temperature, and higher albedo all lead to harder spectra. For typical coronal temperatures and disk albedo, the lowest achievable photon index with a static slab corona fully covering the disk is approximately 1.7-1.8. With the upgraded version of MONK, we are now able to achieve global energy equilibrium for a given disk-corona system. This approach holds significant potential for constraining the coronal geometry using not only the observed flux but also polarization. A static slab does not appear to be a favorable coronal geometry for the hard state of XRBs, even when global energy balance is taken into account. In future work, we will explore truncated disk geometries and outflowing coronae as potential alternatives. (shortened)",

      "abstract": "On Atomic Line Opacities for Modeling Astrophysical Radiative Transfer Jonathan Morag High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) In astrophysics, atomic transition line opacity is a primary source of uncertainty in theoretical calculations of radiative transfer. Much of this uncertainty is dominated by the inability to resolve the lines in frequency, leading to the use of approximate frequency-averaged treatments, often employing the `line-expansion formalism'. In this short paper we assess the usage of this formalism in simulations, specifically the prominent Eastman \\& Pinto 1993 formula (hereafter EP93). As a case study, we reproduce EP93 opacities from the commonly-used STELLA simulations. The latter previously yielded orders of magnitude discrepancy in observed emission relative to similar simulations from our group. The discrepancy is due to differences in line opacity treatment. We show that the widely used EP93 expansion opacity substantially underestimates photon emissivity and reprocessing rates, even when it correctly captures photon mean-free-paths. We also highlight the importance of introducing micro-plasma electron excitation level cutoffs in the equation of state (EOS) for calculating opacity. We propose a new method for calculating emissivity, based on a modification of the simple frequency-bin averaged opacity method, in a way that incorporates the effect of expansion on effective line strength. This formulation should reduce the overestimation of the opacity that may occur with the simple averaging method. To our knowledge, no fully-consistent coarse-frequency solution currently exists for line modeling in these systems. Finally, we describe new features in our updated publicly available high-resolution frequency-dependent opacity table.",

To date, PPM and EOS inference have been carried out as two separate steps, with the former using EOS-agnostic priors. This approach has several drawbacks. Ideally, one would perform a fully hierarchical Bayesian inference where the pulse profile and EOS model parameters are jointly fit, but implementing such a framework is complex and computationally demanding. Here, we present an intermediate solution introducing an EOS-informed prior on mass-radius into the existing PPM pipeline using normalizing flows. By focusing on the parameter space consistent with certain EOSs, this approach both tightens constraints on neutron star parameters while reducing computational costs and requiring minimal additional implementation effort. We test this approach on two pulsars, PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0437-4715, and with two EOS model families: a model based on the speed of sound inside the neutron star interior (CS) and a piecewise-polytropic (PP) model. Both EOS models implement constraints from chiral effective field theory calculations of dense matter. For both pulsar datasets, the inferred radius credible intervals are narrower than in the EOS-agnostic case, with CS favoring smaller radii and PP favoring larger radii. For PSR J0437-4715, the EOS-informed priors reveal a new, more extreme geometric mode that is statistically favored but physically questionable. Including the PPM posteriors in the subsequent EOS inference further tightens the mass-radius posteriors through the chiral effective field theory constraints. However, there is also a sensitivity to the high-density extensions, where the PP (CS) model produces a shift towards larger (smaller) radii and corresponding stiffening (softening) of the pressure-energy density relation.",

Most theories of dust formation in SNe heavily rely only on SN 1987A. In the last two years, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled us to probe the dust evolution in decades-old SNe, such as SN 2004et, SN 2005ip, and SN 1980K. In this paper, we present two decades of dust evolution in SN 2005af, combining early-time infrared observations with Spitzer Space Telescope and recent detections by JWST. We have used a chemical kinetic model of dust synthesis in SN ejecta to develop a template of dust evolution in SN 2005af. Moreover, using this approach, for the first time, we have separately quantified the dust formed in the pre-explosion wind that survived after the explosion, and the dust formed in the metal-rich SN ejecta post-explosion. We report that in SN 2005af, predominantly carbon-rich dust formed in the ejecta, with a total mass of at least 0.02 Msun. In the circumstellar medium, the surviving oxygen-rich dust amounts to about 0.003-0.006 Msun, yielding a total dust mass of at least 0.025 Msun.",

Coleman Miller, Jean-Michel Desert Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) A handful of enigmatic Jupiter-mass objects have been discovered orbiting pulsars. One such object, PSR\\,J2322-2650b, uniquely resembles a hot Jupiter exoplanet due to its minimum density of 1.8 g/cm^3 and its ~1900 K equilibrium temperature. We use JWST to observe PSR J2322-2650b's emission spectrum across an entire orbit. In stark contrast to every known exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star, we find an atmosphere rich in molecular carbon (C3, C2) with strong westward winds. Our observations open up new exoplanetary chemical (ultra-high C/O and C/N ratios of >100 and >10,000, respectively) and dynamical regimes (ultra-fast rotation with external irradiation) to observational study. The extreme carbon enrichment poses a severe challenge to the current understanding of ``black widow'' companions, which were expected to consist of a wider range of elements due to their origins as stripped stellar cores.",

Comments welcome. Significant additions since the last upload. Some relevant movies here this https URL Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn) The sources of turbulence in our Galaxy may be diverse, but core-collapse supernovae (SNe) alone provide enough energy to sustain a steady-state galactic turbulence cascade at the observed velocity dispersion. By localizing and analyzing supernova remnants (SNRs) in high-resolution SN-driven galactic disk cut-out simulations from Beattie et al. (2025), I show that isolated SNRs source incompressible turbulence through baroclinic vorticity generation localized at the unstable contact discontinuity. Through the spherical harmonic power spectrum of the corrugations, I provide evidence that this process is seeded by surface instabilities and 2D turbulence on the shell, which corrugates and folds the interface, becoming the strongest source of baroclinicity in the simulations. I present an analytical relation for a baroclinicity-fed incompressible mode (co)spectrum, which matches that observed in the simulated SNRs, and reveals a $k^{-17/20}$ spectrum that drives the turbulence. I show that vortex stretching allows for modes to be shed from the contact discontinuity into the surrounding medium and derive a timescale criteria for this process, revealing that young SNR with radii close to the cooling radius are efficient at radiating turbulence. The unstable layer produces a spectrum of incompressible modes $\\propto k^{-3/2}$ locally within the SNRs. Through the inverse cascade mechanism revealed in Beattie et al. (2025), this opens the possibility that the $k^{-3/2}$ spectrum, arising from corrugated folds in the unstable layer, imprints itself on kiloparsec scales, thereby connecting small-scale structure in the layer to the large-scale incompressible turbulence cascade.",

This development enables efficient neutron tagging via the large capture cross section of gadolinium, greatly improving the identification of inverse beta decay events, the primary channel for detecting the diffuse supernova neutrino background [DSNB]. The upgrade also enhances sensitivity to galactic and pre-supernova neutrinos, as well as atmospheric neutrino interactions. To realize this capability, extensive work was performed, including the construction and operation of the EGADS demonstrator, the refurbishment of the SK tank, the development of radiopure gadolinium production methods, and the validation of the loading and uniformity of gadolinium in solution. Early SK-Gd operation has demonstrated high neutron-tagging efficiency, reduced backgrounds, and world-leading limits on the DSNB flux.

Existing models of the CND commonly use one circular orbit to describe the motion of its gas. Here, we explore a much broader range of models. In the combined potential of Sgr A* and the NSC, we consider non-Keplerian rosette orbits as well as a circular disk, which is formed using a finely-spaced set of concentric rings. For both systems, we test various inner/outer radii, inclinations, and position angles, sampling a total of $\\sim3.3 \\times 10^{5}$ models. We then conduct mock observations of all models to construct velocity maps, which we compare with HCN ($J=1{-}0$) observations of the CND.

Volonteri Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present the first-year results of the MUSE Large Program \"Cosmic Duets\", aimed at obtaining adaptive-optics assisted MUSE observations with an angular resolution of 0.1\"-0.2\", providing integral-field spectroscopy of sub-arcsec separation dual and lensed active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates. These observations reveal previously unexplored properties of dual and lensed systems, key to understanding galaxy evolution, black hole mergers, and strong-lensing modeling. Targets were selected using the Gaia Multi-Peak (GMP) technique, which identifies pairs of point-like sources with separations below 0.8\" in the Gaia catalog. MUSE spatially resolved spectroscopy provides redshifts, ionization diagnostics, and absorption systems along the line of sight. We report results for 30 GMP-selected targets at z=0.5-3.5. All systems show at least two spatially resolved components. Nineteen objects are confirmed as AGN multiplets, including 6 dual AGN, 10 doubly-lensed quasars, and 3 quadruply-lensed systems, while the remaining 11 correspond to alignments with foreground stars. Among spectroscopically confirmed dual AGN in the literature, 24 pairs have separations below 7 kpc, and our sample accounts for 25% of them. We study dual and lensed AGN distributions as a function of redshift, magnitude, and projected separation, and find that bright systems (J<16.5) are dominated by lensed quasars, whereas the fraction of dual AGN increases at fainter magnitudes. This first-year sample demonstrates the high efficiency of GMP pre-selection combined with MUSE spectroscopy. The full program, targeting 150 systems, will enable statistical studies of dual AGN incidence and detailed constraints on mass distribution in strong-lensing galaxies.",

Koekemoer, Micaela B. Bagley, Steven L. Finkelstein, Casey Papovich, Nor Pirzkal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We introduce a new non-parametric technique to quantify the spatially-resolved relationship between the local star-formation rate (SFR) and dust attenuation. We then apply it to 14 star-forming galaxies at $1.0<z<2.5$ using JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopy from the NGDEEP survey. First, we construct spatially resolved ($\\sim$1~kpc per pixel) Balmer decrement ($H\\alpha/H\\beta$) maps of these galaxies and derive their corresponding dust attenuation and intrinsic SFR maps. We then rank-order the map pixels by attenuation and construct a cumulative distribution curve of the total SFR as a function of increasing attenuation. We define $\\mathrm{A}^{\\mathrm{SFR}}_{10\\%}$, $\\mathrm{A}^{\\mathrm{SFR}}_{50\\%}$, and $\\mathrm{A}^{\\mathrm{SFR}}_{90\\%}$ as the dust attenuation levels behind which 10\\%, 50\\%, and 90\\% of the total integrated SFR is screened, respectively. These metrics quantify the probability that a given star-forming region lies behind a given level of attenuation. Across the full sample, 50\\% of the local star formation occurs behind an attenuation of 3.41 mag or higher ($\\mathrm{A}^{\\mathrm{SFR}}_{50\\%}$). This indicates that the bulk of star formation in these galaxies is significantly attenuated by dust. The value of $\\mathrm{A}^{\\mathrm{SFR}}_{10\\%}$ equals 1.45 for the average profile, indicating that even the least attenuated star-forming regions are still highly attenuated. The globally measured attenuation more closely matches $\\mathrm{A}^{\\mathrm{SFR}}_{10\\%}$ than $\\mathrm{A}^{\\mathrm{SFR}}_{50\\%}$. This suggests that the global value is weighted toward the least dust-obscured star-forming regions and significantly underestimates the typical attenuation a star-forming region encounters. Our results demonstrate a new approach for understanding the extremely dusty local conditions of the star-forming interstellar medium in SF galaxies at cosmic noon.",

Many AGN show a narrow Fe K-alpha line at 6.4 keV and associated Compton-scattered continua, produced by primary continuum scattering in cold, neutral material far from the central supermassive black hole. We present a novel approach based on Simulation-Based Inference with Neural Posterior Estimation (SBI-NPE) to train a machine-learning (ML) model using NuSTAR spectral fitting results from the literature, adopting the physically motivated MYTORUS-decoupled model, which separates line-of-sight and global equivalent hydrogen column densities (NH_Z and NH_S). To overcome limitations of traditional frequentist fitting such as local minima, limited automation, reproducibility, and computational cost, we employ normalizing flows and autoregressive networks to learn flexible posterior distributions from simulated spectra. From 34 NuSTAR spectral fits, we generate 34,000 synthetic spectra using uniform and Gaussian parameter distributions, showing that the latter is more strongly observationally driven. The network is trained to infer four MYTORUS parameters: NH_Z, NH_S, the photon index Gamma, and the relative normalization AS. Mutual information analysis identifies optimal spectral regions and motivates the inclusion of redshift, exposure time, and Galactic absorption. The observation-based grid significantly outperforms uniform sampling, achieving predictive accuracies above 90 percent for NH_S and AS, 89 percent for NH_Z, and 82 percent for Gamma within one sigma, with a joint accuracy of 70 percent for all parameters. We publicly release ML MYTORUS with a web interface enabling fast, reproducible inference from NuSTAR spectra. An application to NGC 4388 illustrates the promise of this approach.",

The 2$_{0,2}$-1$_{0,1}$ line at 127 GHz was mapped with 20\" resolution ($\\sim$2800 au), revealing extended CH2NH emission across the core. The peak line intensity coincides with the well-known c-C3H2 peak, while the integrated intensity peaks between the HNCO and dust continuum peaks due to broader linewidths in the latter region. Column densities of CH2NH are $\\sim$(0.5-1.4$\\times$)10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, corresponding to fractional abundances of $5\\times10^{-11}$-$1\\times10^{-10}$, with a trend decreasing from the southern, carbon-chain rich region to the dust and HNCO peak in the north. Comparison with complementary molecular maps and the gas-grain chemical model of Sipilä et al. suggests that neutral-neutral gas-phase reactions and dissociative recombination dominate in the outer carbon-chain shell. This study demonstrates that CH2NH, a simple nitrogen- and carbon-bearing molecule previously detected with pointed observations in other cold cores, is present and spatially extended in the evolved pre-stellar core L1544. This indicates that prebiotic nitrogen-carbon chemistry continues efficiently up to the onset of gravitational collapse, providing key constraints for astrochemical models and the early stages of chemical complexity leading to amino acids.",

Further developments started from HBT experiments to exploit quantum bunching of photons in incoherent light sources played foundational role in the development of quantum optics. When the two detectors in an HBT experiment are co-located, typically implemented using a beam splitter, a zero-baseline intensity correlation is obtained, which after deconvolution of the detector response function, yields the temporal component of the second-order coherence function. Unlike spatial correlations, this function is independent of the source brightness distribution, or its size, giving direct insight into the properties of the source's emission process itself - photon statistics. Along with photometric and spectral information, the second order coherence function can be used to constrain the emission mechanisms and discriminate between thermal, synchrotron, bremsstrahlung and stimulated emission processes. Evolution of the emission processes would likewise drive changes in the second order coherence. Light coherence information along with multi-wavelength observations, can become a complementary \"messenger\", carrying internal information about the astronomical source.",

What is needed are higher-resolution spectra at deeper depths to study these sources in detail. We present The High-(Redshift+Ionization) Line Search (THRILS) program: deep (>8 hr) observations in two pointings of JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy to 1) probe high ionization spectral features in z>8 galaxies that are indicative of top-heavy initial mass functions or growing massive black holes, 2) search for accreting supermassive black holes in typical galaxies at z~4-9 through broad Balmer line emission, and 3) probe the stellar-mass growth histories of massive galaxies. We include spectroscopic redshift measurements for 89 sources from the THRILS data, as well as a detection threshold for the full and half depth integration times of the program.",

Despite its importance, the statistical properties of the turbulent fluctuations generated by collisionless reconnection, which are essential for understanding how this energy conversion proceeds, remain poorly understood. Here, we employ large-scale 3D particle-in-cell simulations to investigate the turbulence characteristics of velocity and magnetic field fluctuations generated by collisionless reconnection in a magnetically dominated plasma. We characterize their statistical properties by computing structure functions along different directions within the reconnection layer. We find that the square root of the second-order velocity structure function follows a power-law scaling with a slope near $\\sim1/3$ at intermediate to large scales, consistent with Kolmogorov-like turbulence, a behavior robust along the inflow, outflow, and guide-field directions. The square root of the second-order magnetic structure function consistently exhibits a steeper slope, in the range $\\sim 0.6 - 0.8$. The presence of a finite guide field does not systematically modify the slope of the velocity fluctuations, while it progressively steepens the scaling of the magnetic fluctuations in the guide-field and inflow directions. We also measure higher-order structure functions, which reveal strong magnetic intermittency along the outflow direction and weaker intermittency in the inflow and guide-field directions. In addition, the local anisotropies of both velocity and magnetic field fluctuations are greater for stronger guide fields. These results provide a first systematic characterization of the multiscale nature of turbulence in collisionless reconnection layers, with important implications for plasma heating and particle acceleration.",

      "abstract": "Mode Energy Partition in Partially Ionized Compressible MHD Turbulence Yue Hu Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate how neutral-ion collisional damping modifies the spectral properties and energy partition of compressible MHD turbulence using a suite of 3D two-fluid simulations. By systematically varying the neutral-ion coupling strength and decomposing the turbulent velocity field into Alfvén, slow, and fast modes, we quantify how each mode responds to the transition from strong to weak coupling. In the strong-coupling regime, the Alfvén and slow modes follow nearly Kolmogorov $k^{-5/3}$ spectra and dominate the kinetic energy budget, while fast modes exhibit a steeper spectrum and contribute $\\sim$10\\% of the total energy. As the coupling weakens and neutral-ion damping becomes significant, all mode spectra steepen, with the Alfvén mode approaching a dissipation-dominated $k^{-4}$ spectrum. The slow-mode energy fraction increases substantially toward small scales, reaching up to $\\sim$70\\% near the damping scale, whereas the Alfvén-mode fraction decreases correspondingly. In contrast, the fast-mode energy fraction remains largely insensitive to coupling strength. These results demonstrate that partial ionization not only steepens the turbulent spectra but also reshapes the mode energy distribution, enhancing the relative importance of the slow mode while suppressing Alfvén mode in the damping regime. Our findings have important implications for turbulence-driven processes in the partially ionized interstellar medium, including cosmic-ray transport and acceleration.",

Bobylev Astrophysical Bulletin, 2025, Vol. 80, No. 3, pp. 369-393 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The regularity/chaoticity of orbits of 45 globular clusters in the central region of the Galaxy with a radius of 3.5 kpc, which are subject to the greatest influence of the elongated rotating bar, is analyzed. Various methods of analysis are used, namely, the methods of calculating the maximum characteristic Lyapunov exponents (MCLE), MEGNO (Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits), the Poincaré section method, the frequency method based on calculating fundamental frequencies, and a new method is proposed based on calculating the orbit amplitude spectrum as a function of time and calculating the entropy of the amplitude spectrum as a measure of orbital chaos. Bimodality is found in the histogram of the distribution of positive Lyapunov exponents calculated in the classical version, without renormalizing the shadow orbit, which allows implementing a probabilistic method for GC classification, which is also a new approach. To construct the orbits of globular clusters, we used the gravitational potential model with a bar in the form of a triaxial ellipsoid. The following bar parameters were adopted: mass $10^{10} M_\\odot$, length of the semi-major axis 5 kpc, angle of rotation of the bar axis 25$^o$, rotation velocity 40 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. To form the 6D-phase space required for integrating the orbits, we used the most accurate astrometric data to date from the Gaia satellite (EDR3), as well as new refined average distances to globular clusters. Globular clusters with regular and chaotic dynamics were classified.",

The historical record of the flux variations of the monitored stars by EROS-2 will be a unique asset for time domain astronomy and to complement current and future searches of transient sources. We describe the set of light curves obtained by EROS-2 program over the years 1996 to 2003, monitoring more than 86 million stars, which is publicly released through the Centre de Données de Strasbourg (CDS). The numbers of light curves in this data set are 28.7 and 4.0 million in LMC, respectively SMC, 42.9 million in the Galactic Bulge and 10.4 million towards the Galactic spiral arms, with several hundred measurements for each object.

With CAPOS, we can mitigate the observational difficulties limiting access to bulge globular clusters in the optical and investigate them in more detail in the near-IR. Aims. To perform a rigorous abundance analysis of the metal-rich bulge globular cluster NGC 6304, in order to determine its detailed chemical composition and identify multiple populations. Methods. We analyzed APOGEE-2 near-IR spectra of 27 giant members. The abundances of 17 elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Ce) were derived using the BACCHUS code, using atmospheric parameters from both ASPCAP and photometry (Gaia and 2MASS). Results. We derived $[{\\rm Fe/H}] = -0.45\\pm0.05$ using the ASPCAP parameters, and $[{\\rm Fe/H}] = -0.45\\pm0.08$ when using photometric parameters, with no evidence of an intrinsic metallicity spread. NGC 6304 shows $[\\alpha/{\\rm Fe}]_{\\rm spec} = 0.24\\pm0.07$ and $[\\alpha/{\\rm Fe}]_{\\rm phot} = 0.23\\pm0.08$. We find a significant spread in $[{\\rm N/Fe}]$, with $\\sigma_{\\rm spec} = 0.54$ and $\\sigma_{\\rm phot} = 0.46$, along with a C-N anticorrelation. Furthermore, we detect a correlation of Ce with both N and Al, consistent with patterns observed in some metal-rich bulge globular clusters. Conclusions. We find a significant star-to-star variation in Na, but a minimal variation in O. The absence of the Mg-Al anticorrelation supports the evidence that the MgAl cycle is not active in globular clusters at high metallicity. The observed correlation between Ce and both N and Al suggests that the enrichment of these elements may be driven by asymptotic giant branch stars, positioning Ce as an element involved in multiple populations in metal-rich globular clusters. We find that abundances are consistent with those of bulge field stars of similar metallicity, suggesting a similar origin and chemical evolution.",

NIRSpec spectra imply that many of these systems underwent intense starburst episodes (SFR$\\,\\gtrsim300M_\\odot$/yr), though direct evidence of such starbursts in the Gyr largely comes from exceptionally rare dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) selected in the far-infrared. Here, we report the discovery of an extremely red ($\\beta=-0.6$) yet UV-bright (F115W = 26.0 mag) $z\\sim6$ star-forming system selected as a Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) over $\\approx$500 arcmin$^2$ of deep NIRCam imaging. This galaxy (UDS_43065) shows photometric colors implying a prominent Balmer break and strong H$\\alpha$ emission, consistent with a dramatic burst of star formation (SFR$\\,\\approx\\,500-1000\\,M_\\odot$/yr) occurring 5-10 Myr ago that formed 20-40% of its total stellar mass ($\\approx1.5\\times10^{10}M_\\odot$) with little activity since. This galaxy is one of only two objects with $M_\\ast>10^{10}M_\\odot$ across our full sample of 813 $z\\sim6$ star-forming LBGs, and the only galaxy with a confident extremely-red UV slope ($\\beta>-1$). UDS_43065 is clearly resolved yet compact in F444W ($r_e=400\\pm10$ pc) indicating a very high stellar mass surface density of log$(\\Sigma_\\mathrm{eff}/(M_\\odot\\,\\mathrm{kpc}^{-2}))=10.25\\pm0.13$ comparable to quenched $z\\sim2-7$ galaxies. If the inferred star formation history (SFH) of UDS_43065 is corroborated with further observations, this object would seemingly represent a rarely-seen transitional phase between massive DSFGs and passive systems in the first Gyr, helping resolve the puzzling abundance of early massive quenched galaxies.",

Using photometric selection -- including magnitude, color, angular size, photometric redshift, and size-mass cuts -- we identify 793 satellite candidates around these 393 hosts. Our selection leverages two medium-band filters targeting H$\\alpha$ and [O \\textsc{iii}] emission, enabling a nearly complete sample of star-forming, Magellanic Clouds-like satellites with $M_{\\star, \\rm sat} \\gtrsim 10^{8} M_\\odot$.

Submitted to AAS journals Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We investigate large-scale gas kinematics in the multiphase circumgalactic medium (CGM) using the observed correlation between line width and column density for H I and O VI absorbers. Leveraging extensive public galaxy survey data at $z\\lesssim0.1$, we construct a new galaxy sample based on the availability of background QSOs with far-ultraviolet spectra from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). By combining this FUSE-galaxy sample with literature collections, we find that H I absorbers exhibit a clear inverse correlation between Doppler width and column density over nearly five orders of magnitude in $N_{\\rm HI}$, from $N_{\\rm HI} \\approx 10^{13}\\rm~{cm^{-2}}$ to $N_{\\rm HI} \\approx 10^{18}\\rm~{cm^{-2}}$, while O VI absorption follows a positive correlation across $N_{\\rm OVI}\\approx 3\\times10^{13}$-$10^{15}\\rm~{cm^{-2}}$. We develop a model framework to interpret these contrasting trends and show that H I absorbers are best described as systems of approximately constant total column density ($N_{\\rm H}$), whereas O VI traces regions of roughly constant spatial density ($n_{\\rm H}$ and $n_{\\rm OVI}$). Under the latter scenario, the observed $b_{\\rm OVI}$-$N_{\\rm OVI}$ relation maps directly to a velocity-size relation consistent with a Kolmogorov-like turbulent spectrum. Together, these findings reveal a coherent physical picture in which H I and O VI trace a continuous turbulent cascade spanning more than five orders of magnitude in spatial scale-from cool, photoionized clumps to warm, highly ionized halo gas--with accretion in the halo outskirts likely driving the turbulent energy injection that sustains the multiphase CGM.",

To remove systematics caused by stellar mass (M*) and star formation rate (SFR), we construct stacked spectra binned by redshift within fixed M* and SFR ranges, as well as across the full ranges. We find that the [OII]3727/Hb ratio drops by a factor of five from z~3 to 8 at fixed M* and SFR, in contrast to the nearly constant [OIII]5007/Hb ratio. We derive metallicities via the direct Te method using the [OIII]4363 line, and identify that high-z galaxies lie on the low-metallicity end of the anti-correlation between ionization parameter and metallicity at z~0. Photoionization modeling demonstrates that the redshift evolution, where metallicity decreases and ionization parameter increases, self-consistently explains the observed line ratios. We then examine the mass-metallicity (MZ) and fundamental (MZ-SFR) relations. Including additional galaxies at z~10-12, we find that the MZ relation monotonically decreases from z~3 to 10 at fixed M*, while the MZ-SFR relation shows a significant decline at z>8. Based on the ChemicalUniverseMachine model, this evolutionary trend can be explained by enhanced gas inflow (outflow) by a factor of ~5 (~1.7) at z>8.",

Sasmal, Soumen Bera, Sabyasachi Pal, Soumen Mondal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The head--tail (HT) morphology of radio galaxies is seen for a class of radio sources where the primary lobes are being bent in the intercluster weather due to strong interactions between the radio jets and their respective intracluster medium. A systematic search has been carried out for new HT radio galaxies from the Very Large Array Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters survey database at $1400\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$. Here, we present a catalog of 717 new HT sources, among which 287 are narrow-angle tail (NAT) sources whose opening angle between the two lobes is less than $90^\\circ$, and 430 are wide-angle tail (WAT) whose opening angle between the two lobes is greater than $90^\\circ$. NAT radio sources are characterized by tails bent in a narrow ``V''-like shape; the jet bending in the case of WAT radio galaxies are such that the WATs exhibit wide ``C''-like morphologies. Optical counterparts are found for 359 HT sources. We report HT sources with luminosity ranges $10^{38} \\lesssim L_{1.4\\,\\mathrm{GHz}} \\lesssim 10^{45}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$ and redshifts up to 2.01. The various physical properties of these HT sources are mentioned here. Some statistical studies have been done for this large number of newly discovered HT sources.",

Shimonishi 25 pages, 18 figures, published in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Recent observations have revealed significant variations in the abundances of gas- and ice-phase molecules in galaxies with different luminosities and types. In order to discuss the physical origins of these variations, we incorporate gas- and dust-phase interstellar chemistry into galaxy-scale simulations with various baryonic physics including dust formation, evolution, and destruction, all of which are essential for the calculations of 400 interstellar molecule species. The new simulations can accordingly predict the abundances of gas- and ice-phase molecular species such as H_2O and CO_2 ice within individual molecular gas cloud of galaxies based on gas density and temperature, dust temperature (T_dust), elemental abundances (e.g., CHNOPS), UV radiation strength (F_UV), and cosmic ray ionisation rate (zeta_CR) within the clouds. Since this is the first of the series of papers, we describe the details of the new simulations and present the preliminary results focused on the spatial distributions of H_2O, CO, CO_2, and CH_3OH ice species in a disk galaxy similar to the Milky Way. We particularly discuss how T_dust and gas-phase elemental abundances can control the spatial distributions of the above molecules in galaxies. We briefly discuss the total amount of H_2O and CO_2 ices and radial distributions of PN and PO molecules in the Galaxy.",

Submitted to ESO White Papers - Expanding Horizons Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Chemical clocks, based on age-sensitive stellar abundance ratios, offer a powerful and scalable approach to reconstruct the formation history of the Milky Way. This white paper outlines how wide-field, high-resolution spectroscopy can transform chemical clocks into precise and broadly applicable stellar age estimators when combined with astrometry and asteroseismology. We summarize the current limitations, including calibration across Galactic environments and the impact of internal stellar evolution, and define the observational requirements needed to overcome them. The Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST), with its large field of view, high multiplex, and broad wavelength coverage at high spectral resolution, is uniquely suited to deliver the homogeneous datasets required to map the age structure of the Galaxy at unprecedented scale. Such a capability will enable decisive progress in Galactic archaeology and stellar evolution studies.",

Ysard Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Dust is an important tracer of the structure of interstellar clouds, as well as a central factor in the thermal balance and chemistry of the clouds. Our knowledge of the dust properties is nevertheless incomplete, especially regarding the dense star-forming clouds. The aim is to study dust evolution in the Orion Molecular Cloud 3 (OMC-3) and how uncertainty regarding dust properties affects estimates of the radiation field and the cloud mass. We constructed three-dimensional radiative transfer (RT) models to fit the far-infrared (FIR) observations of dust emission in the OMC-3 field and used near-infrared (NIR) extinction measurements as additional constraints. We examined fits to the dense star-forming filaments and to the surrounding cloud, including some tests with spatial dust property this http URL 160-250 $\\mu$m observations of dust emission could be fitted moderately well with any of the dust models tested, but few models are consistent with the measured NIR extinction. The best match to observations is found with dust models such as the THEMIS model of large porous grains, with or without ice mantles, and with mean grain sizes up to ~ 0.3$\\mu$m. The flattening of the NIR extinction curve excludes larger grain sizes, except possibly in the central ridge. Compared to models of lower column density clouds, the results were relatively insensitive to the line-of-sight (LOS) cloud size and the spectral shape of the heating radiation field. In addition, the effect of embedded stars remained very localised in OMC-3. The results suggest that the dust in the OMC-3 region is evolved with a grain of average size $a$=0.1-0.3 $\\mu$m, potentially with ice mantles.",

I exploited the APOGEE DR17 data base and selected highly confident tidal tails members of 17 Milky Way globular clusters, for which the above four properties were computed for the first time. From all possible paired property combinations, I found that $\\sigma$$_{\\rm V_{LOS}}$ and $\\sigma$$_{\\rm V_{Tan}}$ resulted to be highly correlated, nearly to the identity relationship. This observation-based correlation resulted to be in an overall very good agreement with that arising from the aforementioned predictions. Additionally, when the four analyzed properties are linked to the accretion groups of the Milky way to which the globular clusters are meant to be associated, I found kinematically cold and hot tidal tails pertaining to globular clusters distributed in all the considered accretion groups. This outcome could be an evidence that globular clusters form in galaxies within a wide variety of dark matter halos, with different masses and profiles.",

These models provide an idealised description of globular clusters that rotate asynchronously with respect to their orbital motion around a host galaxy. Model construction proceeds by extension of the truncated King models, using a newly defined asynchronicity parameter to couple the tidal and rotational perturbations. The method of matched asymptotic expansion is used to derive a global solution to the free boundary problem posed by the corresponding set of Poisson-Laplace equations. We explore the relevant parameter space and outline the intrinsic properties of the resulting models, both structural and kinematic. Their triaxial configuration, characterised by extension in the direction of the galactic centre and flattening toward the orbital plane, is found to depart further from spherical symmetry for larger values of the asynchronicity parameter. We hope that these simplified analytical models serve as useful tools for investigating the interplay of tidal and rotational effects, providing an equilibrium description that complements, and may serve as a basis for, more realistic numerical simulations.",

Prior-driven deblending techniques require extensive fine-tuning and struggle to process large fields. This work aims to develop a fast, reliable deep-learning based deconvolution and denoising super-resolution (SR) technique. We employ a transformer neural network to improve the resolution of Herschel/SPIRE 500 $\\mu$m observations by a factor 4.5, using Spitzer/MIPS 24$\\mu$m and Herschel/SPIRE 250, 350, 500$\\mu$m images. Trained on SIDES and SHARK simulations, we injected instrumental noise into the input simulated images, while keeping the target images noise-free to enhance de-noising capabilities of our method. We evaluated the performance on simulated test sets and real JCMT/SCUBA-2 450 $\\mu$m observations in the COSMOS field which have superior resolution compared to Herschel. Our SR method achieves an inference time of $1s/deg^2$ on consumer GPUs, much faster than traditional deblending techniques. Using the simulation test sets, we show that fluxes of the extracted sources from the super-resolved image are accurate to within 5% for sources with an intrinsic flux $\\gtrsim$ 8 mJy, which is a substantial improvement compared to blind extraction on the native images. Astrometric error is low ($\\lesssim$ 1\" vs 12\" pixel scale). Reliability is $\\gtrsim$ 90% for sources $>$3 mJy and $>$90% of sources with intrinsic fluxes $\\gtrsim5$ mJy are recovered. Applied to real 500 $\\mu$m observations, fluxes of the extracted sources from the super-resolved map agree well with SCUBA-2 measured fluxes for sources $\\geq$10 mJy. Our technique enables SR over hundreds of $deg^2$ without the need for fine-tuning, facilitating statistical analysis of DSFGs.",

To investigate the nature of compact continuum sources that have been previously identified in this region, we analyzed 1.3 mm dust continuum and molecular line emission. The central millimeter peak MM1 coincides with the centimeter source VLA 2, has a complex molecular spectrum, and is identified as a hot molecular core. Molecular emission of SiO and CH3CN in the vicinity of MM1 reveals kinematics consistent with wide-angle outflow structures and a possible rotating disk in the source. VLA sources 1A, 1B, and 3 are lacking compact millimeter counterparts and trace shocked regions where the outflow interacts with the surrounding material. In particular, VLA 1A, the site of H2O maser super flares, is interpreted as a shock interface that exhibits developed turbulent movements seen in the SiO molecular line. The observed turbulence creates conditions required for H2O maser action, directly linking the nature of VLA 1A to the origin of the H2O maser super flares.",

We present a new approach using symbolic regression trained on a simulation to derive simple, explicit mathematical expressions that estimate galaxy stellar masses from basic observables: photometry and redshift. Using a mock catalogue from the GALFORM semi-analytical model that reproduces the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS), we show that a linear combination of just four observables -- minimally processed $u$- and $i$- band magnitudes, observed $(g-r)$ colour, and redshift -- can recover stellar masses with accuracy comparable to traditional spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, but with negligible computational cost. Our expressions can be evaluated instantaneously for millions of galaxies, making them ideal for next-generation surveys like LSST and Euclid. When observational errors are included, symbolic regression achieves a similar accuracy to deep neural networks while maintaining transparency. Validation against CIGALE SED fitting on PAUS data shows agreement within 0.13 dex for galaxies with $M_{*} > 10^8 M_{\\odot}$. We demonstrate that the stellar mass function can be recovered at $z < 0.5$, though with distortions at the extremes: the high-mass end is overestimated by a factor of $\\sim 3$ at $10^{11.5} h^{-1} M_{\\odot}$ due to scatter.

This is common practice in simulations of galaxy formation in which following the non-equilibrium abundances of additional elements is computationally expensive. We define the $\\mathrm{H}_2$ excess as the shift in density of the \\ion{H}{I}-$\\mathrm{H}_2$ transition in the reduced network compared to the full chemical network (30 elements). The strength of the $\\mathrm{H}_2$ excess generally increases both with temperature and metallicity, is largely independent of the radiation field strength, and persists across a large range of assumed shielding column densities. For warm gas, with $T\\approx1000~\\mathrm{K}$, the HI-$\\mathrm{H}_2$ transition is shifted by up to 1 dex to lower densities in primordial chemistry networks already for extremely low metallicities ($Z\\geq 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{Z}_{\\odot}$). We confirm our earlier findings that missing reactions with oxygen are largely responsible for this $\\mathrm{H}_2$ excess. A reduced chemical network of hydrogen, helium, and oxygen recovers the molecular hydrogen fractions from a full network and we therefore recommend to include destruction of molecular hydrogen by oxygen in a minimal chemical network for accurate molecular hydrogen abundances.",

Periodicities may originate from different physical processes, including the intermittent gas feeding of the black holes caused by the time-varying non-axisymmetric binary potential, the Doppler boosting of the flux emitted by individual accretion discs bound to the orbiting BHs, and the gravitational lensing of the accretion disc of one black hole due to the presence of the other. Only the Doppler boost scenario applied to circular binaries with non-modulated accretion predicts a sinusoidal light curve, while in the general case, binary signals are expected to show more complex periodic patterns. Current searches for massive black hole binaries rely on techniques tailored to quasi-sinusoidal light curves, but fail to identify the more complex periodicities predicted. We present an alternative method that leverages Gaussian processes, making use of a generic periodic kernel flexible enough for the identification of arbitrary periodicities in unevenly sampled light curves with realistic quasar noise. We demonstrate that it outperforms previously proposed strategies in identifying general periodicities by analysing mock light curves with different baselines. Specifically, we find that our analysis can detect non-sinusoidal periodicities (e.g., sawtooth-shaped) and retrieves a higher fraction of true periodicities when compared to periodogram analysis or Gaussian processes analysis with less flexible periodic kernels. Furthermore, by comparing the retrieved fraction of periodicities between mock PTF light curves and mock LSST light curves, we find that our analysis is most sensitive to the number of observed cycles. The application of this analysis has the potential to greatly increase the scientific return of current and upcoming large time-domain photometric surveys.",

Submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM) survey is an ESO large programme designed to obtain multi-epoch spectroscopy for 929 massive stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). It will provide binary fractions and orbital configurations of binary systems, and search for dormant black-hole binary candidates (OB+BH). Here we present projected rotational velocities (vsini) of all sources and, using the multiplicity properties presented in previous papers, we derive the vsini distributions of apparent single stars, single lined spectroscopic (SB1) binaries, and SB2 systems. We identify a locus in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram where rotational velocities decrease significantly; we interpret this feature as broadly corresponding to the terminal-age main sequence. The main sequence cohort is distinguished by a broad range of vsini values, but with a strong peak in the distribution in the range 30-60 km/s, close to the resolution limit of 30 km/s. Sources in this low vsini peak are distributed throughout the main sequence, and are also present in the SB1 sample, though less prominent than in the single star distribution. A preliminary analysis of the lowest vsini cohort, that includes SB1 systems, implies that roughly one third may be nitrogen rich and we speculate that this cohort is a mix of pristine single stars, long period binaries, and merger products. The SB2 systems appear to be mostly short period binaries in synchronous rotation and have vsini estimates distributed around a mean value of approximately 140 km/s . Higher vsini sources are also present in the single and SB1 systems, all of which have tail to higher vsini values, consistent with tidal and mass-transfer effects. The supergiants, with a few exceptions, have low vsini, the bulk of these systems being essentially unresolved at current spectral resolution.",

Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Mega-MUSE Nearby Galaxy Serendipity Survey is a White Paper in response to the ESO Expanding Horizons Call for Ideas. It is based on the notion that novel observing facilities for astronomy almost always make discoveries that were not anticipated at the time of planning and conceptual design. Unlike other surveys it is not targeting the solution of a single specific astrophysical problem, but enables the exploitation of data obtained from other surveys in Local Group and Local Volume galaxies to clarify open science questions that cannot be solved otherwise. The most prominent objectives are to obtain solid statistics of rare stars and gaseous nebulae as well as their properties that are not accessible in the Milky Way disk due to extinction and selection effects, and the discovery of as yet unknown phenomena.",

Alarcon Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present observations of the detection of a faint high-latitude jet in the inner coma of comet 3I/ATLAS that coincides with the broad plume detected in visible images along PA $280 \\pm 10^{\\circ}$. A detailed analysis shows that the jet was clearly detected on seven nights (2025, August~3, 5, 18, 19, 21, 24, and~29). The jet maintains an almost, though not perfectly, constant position angle (PA) throughout these epochs. High-precision PA measurements at a projected distance of 6000~km from the cometary optocenter reveal a periodic modulation centered at ~ 280 degrees, consistent with a high-latitude jet undergoing precessional motion around the sky-projected spin axis of the nucleus. This is the first periodic jet-angle modulation detected in an interstellar comet. The derived periodicity of $7.74 \\pm 0.35$ h may imply a nucleus rotation period of $P_{\\mathrm{rot}} = 15.48 \\pm 0.70$ h if the jet originates from a single active source near one of the poles. This value is slightly shorter than the period of $P_{\\mathrm{rot}} = 16.79 \\pm 0.23$ h derived from the photometric time series. From the measured PA range, the sky-projected orientation of the spin axis is derived as $\\mathrm{PA} = 280.7 \\pm 0.2^{\\circ}$",

While radio stars offer a potential link between these frames, their utility has been restricted by the scarcity of precise Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) astrometry. In this study, we present new VLBI astrometry of 11 radio stars using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), expanding the existing sample with positions, parallaxes, and proper motions measured. All 11 radio stars were detected, for 10 of which parallaxes and proper motions can be estimated, reaching a precision level of <1% in the best cases. These new samples greatly contribute to the link between ICRF and Gaia-CRF at the optical bright end.",

Accepted for publication on A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Context: The study of the Globular Cluster 47 Tuc offers the opportunity to shed new light on the debated issue on the presence of multiple populations in Globular Clusters, as recent results from HST photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy outlined star-to-star differences in the surface chemical composition. Aims: The goal of the present investigation is the interpretation of recent JWST data of the low main sequence of 47 Tuc, in order to explore the stellar to sub-stellar transition, to derive the mass distribution of the individual sources and to disentangle stars from different populations. Methods: Stellar evolution modelling of low-mass stars of metallicity [Fe/H]=-0.78 and oxygen content [O/Fe]=+0.4 and [O/Fe]=0 is used to simulate the evolution of the first and the second generation of the cluster. The comparison between the calculated sequences with the data points is used to characterize the individual objects, to split the different stellar components and to infer the current mass function of the cluster. Results: The first generation of 47 Tuc harbours 45 % of the overall population of the cluster, the remaining 55 % making up the second generation. The transition from the stellar to the sub-stellar domain is found at $0.074 M_{\\odot}$ and $0.07 M_{\\odot}$ for the first and second generations, respectively. The mass function of both the stellar generations are consistent with a Kroupa-like profile down to $0.22 M_\\odot$.",

They formed in diverse environments-including both our Galaxy and dwarf galaxies- retaining chemical and dynamical signatures that encode their origins and the merger history of the Galaxy. Although significant progress has been made in characterising GC chemistry, most studies have focused on light, $\\alpha$-, and iron-peak elements. In contrast, neutron-capture (n-capture) elements remain sparsely investigated across the GC system, despite their unique ability to trace nucleosynthetic channels and star-formation timescales. A homogeneous and statistically robust mapping of n-process elements in a large sample of GCs would provide powerful constraints on their formation environments, chemical signatures of in situ and accreted systems, and refine our understanding of the early chemical evolution of the MW halo. Addressing this gap requires high-resolution, multiplexing, and blue-sensitive spectroscopy capable of accessing the full suite of n-capture diagnostics in several tens of stars per GC.",

Zylka Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) As part of the N2CLS Survey, we have identified a remarkable overdensity of eight bright dusty star-forming galaxies at z$\\sim$5.2 in the GOODS-N field. Three of these galaxies, N2GN_1_01, 06, and 23 (known as GN10, HDF850.1, and S3, respectively), had previously been spectroscopically confirmed as members of the exceptional large-scale structure at z$\\sim$5.1-5.3, which is notably elongated along the line of sight, spanning 30 cMpc. We present the spectroscopic confirmation of N2GN_1_13 at z$_{\\rm spec}$=5.182, a massive dusty star-forming galaxy identified through targeted NOEMA observations, and N2GN_1_61 at z$_{\\rm spec}$=5.201, revealed using JWST/FRESCO data. In addition to these five spectroscopically confirmed members, we identify three further candidates with photometric redshifts consistent with the overdense structure. These galaxies are massive (with a median stellar mass of 9x 10$^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$) and highly obscured (with a median A$_V$ of 3.3), caught in a short-lived yet extreme starburst phase at z$\\sim$5.2. Their high SFRs (with a median of 590 M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$), efficient baryon to stellar mass conversion ($\\epsilon_{\\star}>$20%), substantial gas reservoir and dust content, suggest rapid evolution and imminent quenching. Six of these galaxies reside in overdense filaments; the remaining two may trace new distinct structures which will have to be spectroscopically confirmed. These few dusty galaxies dominate the star formation within the overdensity, contributing more than the numerous H$_{\\alpha}$ emitters, and surpassing the cosmic average star formation rate density for this epoch. Their properties suggest an accelerated evolution that current models and simulations have difficulty reproducing.",

Queiroz, Stefano Souza, Matthias Steinmetz, Friedrich Anders, Arman Khalatyan, Beatriz Barbuy, Guillaume Guiglion Accepted for publication in A&A on 25-Nov-2025. Abstract abridged Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Studying the composition and origin of the inner region of our Galaxy -- the \"Galactic bulge\" -- is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of the Milky Way and other galaxies. We present new observational constraints based on a sample of around 18,000 stars in the inner Galaxy, combining Gaia DR3 RVS and APOGEE DR17 spectroscopy. Gaia-RVS complements APOGEE by improving sampling of the metallicity, [Fe/H] in the -2.0 to -0.5 dex range. This work marks the first application of Gaia-RVS spectroscopy to the bulge region, enabled by a novel machine learning approach (hybrid-CNN) that derives stellar parameters from intermediate-resolution spectra with precision comparable to APOGEE's infrared data. We performed full orbit integrations using a barred Galactic potential and applied orbital frequency analysis to disentangle the stellar populations in the inner Milky Way. For the first time, traced by the field stars, we are able to robustly identify the long-sought pressure supported bulge. We show this stellar population to be chemically and kinematically distinct from the other main components co-existing in the same region. The spheroidal bulge has a metallicity distribution function (MDF) peak at around -0.70 dex extending to solar value, is dominated by a high-[alpha/Fe] population with almost no dependency on metallicity, consistent with very rapid early formation, predating the thick disc and the bar. We find evidence that the bar has influenced the dynamics of the spheroidal bulge, introducing a mild triaxiality and radial extension. We identify a group of stars on X4 orbits, likely native to the early spheroid, as this population mimics the chemistry of the spheroidal bulge, with a minor contamination from the more metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -1.0) halo. We find the inner-thick disc to be kinematically hotter (mean Vphi ~125 km/s) than the local-thick disc. ...",

We analyze a spectroscopic sample of 34 Type 1 AGNs from the JWST Advanced Deep Survey (JADES) survey, spanning redshifts 1.7 < z < 9, to constrain the physical nature of the accretion flows powering these sources with broad-line diagnostics statistically for the first time. At z > 5, we find a marked suppression of high-ionization emission lines (HeII, CIV, NV) relative to prominent broad Halpha and narrow [OIII] features. This contrast places strong constraints on the shape of the ionizing spectral energy distribution (SED) and on the physical conditions in the broad-line region (BLR). By comparing the observations to photoionization models based on SEDs of black holes accreting at sub-Eddington ratios, we show that standard AGN continua struggle to reproduce the observed broad line ratios and equivalent widths across a wide ionization parameter range. These results suggest the need for modified SEDs -- either intrinsically softened due to super-Eddington accretion or radiative inefficiencies in the innermost disk, or externally filtered by intervening optically thick gas that absorbs or scatters the highest-energy photons before they reach the BLR.",

The accretion of the SMBHs is expected to release energy under the form of AGNs. This energy is believed to impact the star formation activity and contribute to the quenching of galaxies. Here, we address this key unsolved issue with our cosmological semi-empirical model DECODE. In DECODE, we grow galaxies with their SFR linked to halo accretion rate distributions via abundance matching. SMBHs are evolved following the stellar mass growth of their host galaxies by assigning an accretion rate at each redshift from the empirical Eddington ratio distributions and duty cycles. We test the assumption that galaxies permanently quench when their central SMBHs approach the limit imposed by the observed $M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma_\\star$ relation, as a proxy of SMBH disruptive feedback. We find that simply imposing the $M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma_\\star$ condition is sufficient to generate a fraction of quenched galaxies consistent with current data, including the newest ones from Euclid. In addition, our minimal, data-driven model, also predicts SMBH scaling relations consistent in slope and normalisation with those observed, and an $M_{\\rm BH} - M_\\star$ relation weakly evolving with redshift. The model also naturally generates SMBH accretion rates peaking within 1 Gyr of their host SFHs. We note that all the main predictions on galaxy quenched fractions and SMBH growth histories and scaling relations are degenerate with those expected in a halo quenching model. The comprehensive data-driven model presented in this work represents an invaluable tool to investigate SMBH demography across time and environments in an accurate, physically motivated manner, ideally suited to rapidly explore the implications from large surveys, such as Euclid and Rubin-LSST.",

Bell, Francesco D'Eugenio, Anna R. Gallazzi, Joel Leja, Stefano Zibetti, Sandro Tacchella Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We analyzed the sizes and star-formation histories (SFHs) of 2908 galaxies with $M_\\star \\geq 10^9$ M$_\\odot$ at $0.6 < z < 1.0$, drawn from the LEGA-C survey. The goal is to investigate the connection between galaxy sizes with SFH, stellar age, and metallicity. SFHs were derived with Prospector by fitting the high signal-to-noise, high spectral resolution spectroscopy drawn from the LEGA-C DR3 together with the broadband photometry from the UltraVISTA catalog. Galaxy sizes were measured by fitting a 2D S{é}rsic profile to the HST ACS~F814W images. We find diverse SFHs and quenching timescales ($\\tau_\\rm{q}$). The main quiescent population quenched over $\\tau_\\rm{q}=1.23\\pm0.04$ Gyr, whereas compact post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) quenched much faster, $\\tau_\\rm{q}=0.13\\pm0.03$ Gyr. At fixed stellar mass, smaller quiescent galaxies quenched more rapidly than larger ones; at fixed size, the dependence on stellar mass is weak. Larger quiescent galaxies are marginally younger, quenched more slowly, and have near-solar metallicities, while compact quiescent galaxies are older, metal-rich, and quenched faster. PSBs formed half their mass later ($z_\\rm{form}\\sim1.9$) and quenched on the shortest timescales. The general trends with galaxy size, $Z_\\star$, and $z_\\rm{form}$ for the quiescent populations remain consistent regardless of the method used to derive the stellar properties. We conclude that compact quiescent galaxies are consistent with both early, moderately fast quenching and with more rapid, late quenching. While this may suggest the existence of multiple quenching channels, our data are also compatible with a continuous distribution of quenching timescales. These findings suggest that different physical mechanisms may drive quenching across galaxy populations, potentially leading to similar morphological outcomes despite differing evolutionary histories.",

Millar Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The recent observation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar ices by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), along with previous gas-phase detections, underscores the importance of grain surface and ice mantle chemistry in the synthesis of COMs. In this study, we investigate the formation and carbon isotope fractionation of COMs by constructing a new astrochemical reaction network that distinguishes the position of $^{13}$C within species (e.g., H$^{13}$COOCH$_3$ and HCOO$^{13}$CH$_3$ are distinguished). We take into account the position of $^{13}$C in each species in gas and solid phase chemistry. This new model allows us to resolve isotopomer-specific $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs formed in the star-forming cores. We consider thermal diffusion-driven radical-radical reactions on the ice surface and non-thermal radiolysis chemistry in the bulk (surface + mantle) ice. We find that carbon isotope fractionation of the functional groups in COMs appears through both non-thermal radiolysis in cold environments and thermal diffusion in warm environments, depending on the COMs. In particular, COMs containing methyl groups show isotopomer differences in $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios that reflect their formation pathways and environments. These isotopomer-resolved fractionation patterns provide a diagnostic tool to probe the origins of COMs in star-forming cores. Our results suggest that future comparisons between high-sensitivity isotopic observations and isotopomer-specific models will be helpful for constraining the relative contributions of thermal and non-thermal formation processes of COMs.",

We find a characteristic $e$-folding radius of $593.7\\pm14.8$ km for Ni and $841.0\\pm15.4$ km for CN; this suggests that the Ni emission is more centrally concentrated in the nucleus of the comet and favors hypotheses involving easily dissociated species such as metal carbonyls or metal-polycyclic-aromatic-hydrocarbon molecules.

Hopkins Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph) The energy distribution is a fundamental property of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. In strongly magnetized turbulence energy imbalances can arise, quantified by the so-called residual energy: $E_r~=~(E_{kin}~ - ~E_{mag})$; $E_{kin}$ and $E_{mag}$ stand for the volume-averaged kinetic and magnetic energy, respectively. Numerical simulations of incompressible turbulence yield $E_r < 0$, which is consistent with Solar wind observations, while in highly compressible turbulence simulations $E_r > $ 0. Differences arise in the cascade of $E_r$ between the two regimes. We explore the properties of $E_r$ in weakly compressible MHD turbulence in the presence of an initially strong (guide) magnetic field. We study the influence of different driving mechanisms and field strengths on the cascade of $E_r$. We run a suite of direct numerical simulations with the PENCIL code. All simulations are maintained through forcing in a quasi-static regime with sonic Mach numbers close to 0.1. We solely change the Alfvén Mach number, or equivalently the plasma beta ($\\beta$) of the simulations. We drive turbulence by either injecting velocity or magnetic fluctuations at large scales and study the power spectra of kinetic, magnetic, density, and $E_r$. Magnetically-driven simulations show locally imbalanced Alfvénic fluctuations and a $\\propto k^{-3/2}$ cascade, consistent with the dynamic alignment theory. Kinetically-driven simulations give rise to a $\\propto k^{-1}$ scaling, consistent with interactions between Alfvén waves scattered by density inhomogeneities -- a hallmark of reflection-driven turbulence. Residual energy is positive with a spectral slope ($\\alpha$) depending on $\\beta$ as: for $\\beta = 4.0$, $-2 \\lesssim \\alpha \\lesssim -5/3$, for $\\beta = 1.0$, $-5/3 \\lesssim \\alpha \\lesssim -3/2$, and for $\\beta = 0.3$, $\\alpha \\approx -1$.",

Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal, December 12, 2025 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) emission from young stars plays a critical role in shaping the evolution of planetary atmospheres and the conditions for habitability. To assess the long-term impact of high-energy stellar radiation, it is essential to empirically trace how X-ray luminosities and spectral hardness evolve during the first ~<1 Gyr, when atmospheric loss and chemical processing are most active. This study extends the X-ray activity-mass-age analysis of <25 Myr stars by Getman et al. (2022) to ages up to 750 Myr, using Gaia-based cluster memberships, new Chandra observations of five rich open clusters (~45--100 Myr), and archival ROSAT and Chandra data for three older clusters (~220--750 Myr). We find a mass-dependent decay in X-ray luminosity: solar-mass stars undergo a far more rapid and sustained decline, accompanied by coronal softening and the disappearance of hot plasma by ~100 Myr, compared to their lower-mass siblings. These trends in solar-mass stars are likely linked to reduced magnetic dynamo efficiency and diminished ability to sustain large-scale, high-temperature coronal structures. The trends are significantly stronger than predicted by widely used XUV-rotation-age relations. The revised trends imply systematically lower rates of atmospheric mass loss and water photolysis, as well as altered ionization environments and chemical pathways relevant to the formation of prebiotic molecules, for planets in close orbits around solar analogs. These effects persist throughout at least the ~<750 Myr interval probed in this study.",

We generated and evaluated a series of hierarchical random forest models to distinguish spectral blends from single very low-mass dwarfs, and to classify their primary and secondary components. Models were trained on a sample of single and synthesized binary templates generated from empirical spectra. We explored various aspects of the design of our models, and find that models trained on a full range of single and binary combinations have the best performance for identification and component classification. These models achieve binary identification recall and precision of $\\gtrsim$85%, median component classification errors of $\\lesssim$0.1 subtypes, and systematic classification uncertainties of $\\lesssim$1 subtype, outperforming index-based methods in terms of fidelity, range, and speed. Optimal performance is achieved for binaries composed of L and T dwarf primaries and late-L and T dwarf secondaries. When applied to the spectra of previously confirmed very low-mass binaries, model performance is degraded due to the prevalence of systems with similar component types, but remains high in the optimal performance range. We propose potential improvements to these models, which can be used to explore binary populations among the thousands to millions of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs anticipated with large-scale spectral surveys such as SPHEREx and Euclid.",

Utilizing TESS's short-cadence (SC) and full-frame image (FFI) photometry, along with Gaia parallaxes and temperatures derived from the Extended Stellar Parametrizer for Hot Stars (ESP-HS) pipeline, we identify 88 new BCEP stars and candidates--85 from SC data and 3 from SPOC-processed FFI observations. These targets exhibit visual magnitudes ranging from 8.0 to 12.0 mag, parallaxes between 0.11 and 1.74 mas, effective temperatures of 18,000 to 30,000 K, and luminosities from 1,500--38,000 $L_\\odot$, consistent with previously cataloged BCEP populations, thereby demonstrating the robustness of our classification criteria. Key findings include: (1) a significant detection disparity between SC and FFI datasets, with 30\\% of SC targets exceeding 18,000 K compared to only 0.7\\% in FFI, reflecting observational biases toward high-luminosity, hotter stars in SC data; (2) four samples near the red edge of the theoretical instability strip, exhibiting sparse pulsation modes that are important samples for testing pulsation models under low-mass, low-temperature conditions; and (3) spatial clustering within the Galactic disk ($|b| < 20^\\circ$), with two high-latitude outliers likely representing runaway stars ejected from disk environments. Our analysis underscores the critical role of space-based photometry in detecting low-amplitude pulsators and the transformative potential of multi-survey integration in the era of time-domain astronomy.

Only one source, OGLE-BLG-RRLYR-00252, appears to be a plausible RR Lyrae detection, potentially representing the first observational evidence of X-ray emission from a star of this type. Its inferred luminosity suggests that RR Lyrae stars are intrinsically at least two orders of magnitude fainter in X-rays than the brightest Cepheids. We also observe a tentative increase in X-ray luminosity with pulsation period among classical Cepheids, and higher luminosities in type II Cepheids at comparable periods.

We confirm that the hemispheric magnetic asymmetry determines the amplitude and direction of such flows. Additionally, we find that these flows turn over and change direction at depths below 0.97R, forming circulation cells with lifetimes dictated again by the hemispheric magnetic imbalance, which is dominated by the occurrences of large sunspots. We also examine connections between cross-equatorial magnetic flux plumes and the flows, and discuss their implications for the equatorial flux cancellation/submergence and the poleward transport of flux.",

      "abstract": "A multi-viewpoint comparison of the velocity field of coronal propagating disturbances Nina Stankovic, Huw Morgan, Marilena Mierla, Nancy Narang, Luciano Rodriguez, David Berghmans Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Small-scale propagating disturbances (PD) are ubiquitous in the solar corona. Time-Normalised Optical Flow (TNOF) is a method developed for mapping PD velocity fields in time series of Extreme-Ultraviolet (EUV) images. We show PD velocity fields of a quiet Sun (QS) region containing a small coronal hole (CH) and filament channel (FC) jointly observed by Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) aboard the Solar Orbiter and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The QS observations acquired on 28 October 2023 in 174A channel of High Resolution EUV Imager (HRIEUV) of EUI and 171A channel of AIA are used. During the time of the observations, the separation angle between Solar Orbiter and SDO was approximately 26\\de. A novel image alignment analysis shows that the dominant formation heights are 11.4Mm for HRIEUV and 4Mm for AIA. Despite this height difference, the PD velocity fields obtained from the observations from the two instruments are in good agreement across the region. In the QS the median PD speed is around 6.7 and 7.4\\kms\\ for HRIEUV and AIA respectively, with maximum speeds of around 40\\kms. The small equatorial CH is a region dominated by a low temperature of $\\approx$0.8MK and is host to high PD speeds, with a median speed of 17\\kms. The velocity field bridges coherently across the CH from neighbouring QS regions from east to west, thus the CH must be overlaid by a system of long, low-lying closed magnetic loops. This unexpected configuration is supported by a potential field (PF) magnetic model and may be due to the longevity of the CH, allowing time for interchange reconnection with neighbouring closed-field regions. The FC is observed to be multithermal, with a narrow central strip of high emission at both low (0.8MK) and high (2.5MK) temperatures and low emission at warm (1.2MK) temperature. The FC has PD speeds similar to those of the QS.",

Rajaguru, Abhinav Govindan Iyer, Ruizhu Chen, Junwei Zhao, Shukur Kholikov The Astrophysical Journal Letters, 984:L1 (8pp), 2025 May 1 Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Using solar-cycle long helioseismic measurements of meridional and zonal flows in the near-surface shear layer (NSSL) of the Sun, we study their spatio-temporal variations and connections to active regions. We find that near-surface inflows towards active latitudes are part of a local circulation with an outflow away from them at depths around 0.97 R, which is also the location where the deviations in the radial gradient of rotation change sign. These results, together with opposite-signed changes over latitude and depth in the above quantities observed during the solar minimum period, point to the action of the Coriolis force on large-scale flows as the primary cause of changes in the rotation gradient within the NSSL. We also find that such Coriolis force-mediated changes in near-surface flows towards active latitudes only marginally change the amplitude of zonal flow and hence are not likely to be its driving force. Our measurements typically achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio ($>$5$\\sigma$) for near-surface flows but can drop to 3$\\sigma$ near the base (0.95 R) of the NSSL. Close agreements between the depth profiles of changes in rotation gradient and in meridional flows measured from quite different global and local helioseismic techniques, respectively, show that the results are not dependent on the analysis techniques.",

Animations available form the authors Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The theoretical expectation that coronal loops should expand with height contrasts with observations that typically show constant cross-sections. We investigate the idea that this discrepancy results from loops being composed of fine threads whose expansion occurs below the resolution limits of instruments like SDO/AIA. In this paper, we present two significant findings: (1) several extended loops exhibit measurable expansion, suggesting length as a critical factor in detection capability, and (2) high-resolution Solar Orbiter/EUI observations have captured expanding loops in active regions. For both AIA and EUI data, we observe cases where thread separation is directly visible as the loops evolve. These findings complement our previous work indicating AIA loops may consist of relatively few threads. Collectively, these observations provide compeling evidence supporting the multi-thread model and offer a potential resolution to the long-standing loop expansion problem in solar coronal physics. However, the high densities and narrow temperature distributions of observed coronal loops remain unresolved.",

The coupling of these modes to the radiative interior is yet to be discussed. We aim to understand the dependence of the modes on the uniformly rotating subadiabatic region below the convection zone, and whether this leads to measurable changes at the surface. We used the Dedalus code to compute the linear eigenmodes in the inertial frequency range in a setup including both the convection zone and the radiative interior down to $0.5 R_\\odot$. We imposed free-surface boundary conditions at both radial boundaries. For comparison, we also computed the eigenmodes in a setup restricted to the convection zone. We find that the inclusion of the radiative zone only slightly modifies the frequencies and the eigenfunctions at the surface, excluding some modes with significant radial motions (high-frequency retrograde and prograde columnar modes). On the other hand, most modes penetrate significantly into the overshooting layer below the convection zone, which significantly reduces the growth rate of the modes and distorts their eigenfunctions near the base of the convection zone. Furthermore, the uniformly rotating subadiabatic radiative zone supports oscillations due to Rossby modes of all possible spherical harmonics and radial nodes. In particular, when the nearest inertial mode in frequency space lies within around 10 nHz and shares the same north-south symmetry, these Rossby modes evolve into mixed modes characterized by significant motions within both the radiative and convection zones. However, such mixed modes have a large mode mass in the radiative interior and thus will be difficult to excite stochastically by convection.",

Lanzafame Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) In recent years, ground- and space-based photometric surveys have characterized the rotational evolution of solar-like stars to an unprecedented level of detail. In this work we focus on the slow-rotator sequence, an emergent feature recognizable in the color-period diagram of Galactic open clusters. Understanding the evolution of this sequence is a promising avenue to formulate a robust rotation period-mass-age relation, which can be used to estimate stellar ages. Our model of the rotational evolution of stars on the slow-rotator sequence takes into account magnetized wind braking and the rotational decoupling between the radiative interior and the convective envelope. This decoupling naturally develops as the internal redistribution of angular momentum lags behind the loss of angular momentum at the stellar surface, and is parameterized in the model by a rotational coupling timescale. Using literature data on rotation and membership of stars in a selection of open clusters of age between 100 Myr and 4 Gyr, we constrain the mass dependence of the two competing processes of wind braking at the surface and angular momentum transport in the interior. Consistently with our previous findings, our best-fitting model requires a mass-dependent coupling timescale; this result is insensitive to the details of the wind braking model used. We show that the mass dependence of the coupling timescale follows a broken power-law in the entire solar-like mass range (0.4-1.25 Msun), with the exponent change occurring at ~ 0.6 Msun. At the same time, our approach can be used to infer semi-empirically the mass dependence of the wind braking model that best fits the observational constraints. Based on our findings, we propose a novel wind braking law with a particularly simple mass term, directly proportional to the moment of inertia of the convective envelope of the star.",

It has been accepted and will be published in the Proceedings of Science this https URL Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) WZ Sge-type dwarf novae form one of the most intriguing classes of compact accreting binaries. They are recognized as the most evolved population of hydrogen-rich cataclysmic variables. Yet they exhibit energetic disk-powered outbursts with an amplitude of 6-9 mag, duration of a month, and decade-long outburst cycles. Despite the dramatic increase in the number of WZ Sge stars over the last decades, there are many unresolved questions, both in terms of their binary evolution and outburst mechanism. In this proceeding paper, I review the recent studies on WZ Sge stars, focusing on their outbursts. Recent observations, both photometrically and spectroscopically, have found the absence of enhanced emission from the hotspot during the early outburst rise in WZ Sge stars, casting doubt on the occurrence of the enhanced mass transfer. Meanwhile, several WZ Sge stars are newly suggested to harbor a magnetic white dwarf, inferring an inner disk truncation in quiescence. Diversity among systems has been discovered: a WZ Sge star with superoutbursts both accompanying and lacking an early superhump phase, one possibly harboring an ONe and massive white dwarf, and one showing optical spectra strongly affected by disk winds. I introduce the connections of WZ Sge stars to period bouncers, helium-rich AM CVn stars, and low-mass X-ray binaries. Finally, prospects of WZ Sge stars in the upcoming time-domain surveys, such as the Rubin Observatory LSST, are presented.",

Three of five previously considered links are revisited here: extended features in M22 in BC48, Te-11 in 483, and AT Cnc in 1645. We aim to develop a procedure to check whether these links are credible. Literal translations of the Chinese texts, historically based arguments, and close readings are combined with astrophysics, (peak brightness, decay time estimate, shell age expansion model calculation, etc.). (a) Nandou's second star, near which the BC48 `guest star' was reported, is identified as tau Sgr, not lambda Sgr, far from the M22 location. A nova in M22 would peak at only m=6.4 \\pm 1.4 mag, and thus a description as a `blue-white' `melon' does not fit; it was likely a comet. (b) The imprecise position (`Shen['s] east') of the `guest star' in 483, its extended (dipper-like) radiance, and the context speak for a bolide. Considering the new (larger) Gaia distance and small extinction towards Te-11 (outside a cloud), its bi-polar morphology and current expansion velocity point to a planetary nebula; as a nova, the shell expansion age is 1100-2000 yr from detailed supersonic expansion calculations. (c) Most certainly, Mars was meant when the source for 1645 reported `a large star entered Yugui'; the verb implies motion. AT Cnc lies neither in Yugui's asterism box nor in the eponymous lunar mansion range. The fluid drag expansion age of AT Cancri's ejecta is 128-631 yr. All three exact ages are unsubstantiated.

Many aspects of these interaction processes are not well-understood till date. Using the energy spectra measured in two mutually orthogonal top hat analyzers (THA 1 and 2), which are part of the Solar Wind Ion Spectrometer (SWIS) subsystem of the Aditya Solar Wind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) on board India's Aditya L1 mission, we gain insights into intricate features of ICME ICME interactions during May 2024 solar event. We report here an unprecedented two-orthogonal-plane perspective of ICME ICME interactions for the first time from the L1 point. The investigation reveals a special interaction region formed by the propagation of the forward shock driven by complex ejecta in the preceding ICME. The interaction causes the formation of a downstream region spanning over 13 hours, which propagates in the interplanetary medium. The observations reveal that this region serves as a site for proton and alpha particle energization, and the particles within this region get distributed from one plane to the other. The presence of forward shock and particle energization is confirmed by the energetic particle flux measurements by the SupraThermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of ASPEX. These observations provide an unprecedented perspective on how solar wind ions become energized and distributed in an ICME-ICME interaction region.",

Two types of spicules, referred to as types I and II, have been identified in observations and studied in previous numerical works. The statistics of type II spicules in 3D numerical simulations have not yet been studied. We aim to compare the statistics of properties such as lengths, lifetimes, widths, heights, inclinations, and maximum velocities of self-consistently formed spicules in a MURaM-ChE simulation with observations. We employ a H$\\alpha$ proxy to identify fine-scale structures at the solar limb resembling spicules in a simulation of an enhanced network region. We track the evolution of 58 such features found in a 21-minute time sequence, and compare their dynamical and morphological properties with those derived from quiet-Sun observations using the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) onboard the Hinode mission in the Ca II H spectral line. Previous studies have shown that spicules show very similar properties in Ca II H and H$\\alpha$. The spicule-like structures found in the simulation have statistical properties which are broadly consistent with those observed with Hinode/SOT. In particular, we find evidence for the self-consistent formation of both type I and type II spicules within the simulation, even in the absence of ambipolar diffusion. We also investigate the properties of rapid blueshifted and redshifted excursions (RBEs and RREs) in the simulation in relation to the spicules.",

Previous work revealed that a strong ambient guide field strongly impacts particle energy gain during reconnection, suppressing energy gain from Fermi reflection by increasing the radius of curvature of reconnected field lines. However, previous simulations have also shown that the maximum energy gain increases with the system size. The physical basis for this result has not been explored. We perform simulations that vary the effective system size over a large range to isolate the processes determining the maximum energy gain. The maximum energy $W_{max}$ is regulated by the number of magnetic-island mergers that occur, as multiple flux ropes that form at early time repeatedly merge until the largest approaches the system scale. Fermi reflection in these repeated mergers dominates particle energy gain. The number of mergers is linked to the effective system size -- larger systems produce a larger number of flux ropes and more mergers. That $W_{max}$ is linked to the number of flux rope mergers has implications for understanding why particle-in-cell simulations only produce powerlaw distributions of energetic particles with a limited range in energy.",

Fleming Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) The Citizen CATE 2024 next-generation experiment placed 43 identical telescope and camera setups along the path of totality during the total solar eclipse (TSE) on 8 April 2024 to capture a 60-minute movie of the inner and middle solar corona in polarized visible light. The 2024 TSE path covered a large geographic swath of North America and we recruited and trained 36 teams of community participants (\"citizen scientists\") representative of the various communities along the path of totality. Afterwards, these teams retained the equipment in their communities for ongoing education and public engagement activities. Participants ranged from students (K12, undergraduate, and graduate), educators, and adult learners to amateur and professional astronomers. In addition to equipment for their communities, CATE 2024 teams received hands-on telescope training, educational and learning materials, and instruction on data analysis techniques. CATE 2024 used high-cadence, high-dynamic-range (HDR) polarimetric observations of the solar corona to characterize the physical processes that shape its heating, structure, and evolution at scales and sensitivities that cannot be studied outside of a TSE. Conventional eclipse observations do not span sufficient time to capture changing coronal topology, but the extended observation from CATE 2024 does. Analysis of the fully calibrated dataset will provide deeper insight and understanding into these critical physical processes. We present an overview of the CATE 2024 project, including how we engaged local communities along the path of totality, and the first look at CATE 2024 data products from the 2024 TSE.",

Typically, data from these sources is minimally processed before being used to train and validate a forecasting model. However, predictive performance can be impaired if defects in and inconsistencies between these data sources are ignored. For a number of commonly used data sources, together with softwares that query and then output processed data, we identify their respective defects and inconsistencies, quantify their extent, and show how they can affect the predictions produced by data-driven machine learning forecasting models. We also outline procedures for fixing these issues or at least mitigating their impacts. Finally, based on our thorough comparisons of the impacts of data sources on the trained forecasting model in terms of predictive skill scores, we offer recommendations for the use of different data products in operational forecasting.",

Roepke, Ruediger Pakmor, Philipp Podsiadlowski, Volker Springel Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Magnetic fields are found in many astrophysical objects, ranging from galaxy clusters to the interstellar medium of galaxies and magnetars. Strong magnetic fields are also observed in massive stars, but it is still unclear how they are generated. There are different theories for their origin: the magnetic fields could be fossil fields from star formation, they could be generated in dynamo processes during stellar evolution, or they could be generated during a merger of two stars. Here, we show how magnetic fields are generated in simulations of mergers of massive main-sequence stars, conducted with the 3D magnetohydrodynamics code AREPO. In these simulations, a $9\\,M_\\odot$ and a $8\\,M_\\odot$ main sequence star merge, whereby the more massive star transfers mass to the less massive one until it is finally disrupted, forming a core--disk structure. During the initial mass transfer, magnetic fields start to be amplified in the accretion stream, saturating after the disruption at an equipartition level. Correspondingly, the magnetic energy starts being present at small scales, growing to larger scales during the merger. During the merger, the magnetic pressure is much smaller than the gas pressure, thus the dynamical impact of the magnetic fields on the merger is small. After the merger, both are similar in some regions and the magnetic field shows a large-scale structure that is mostly toroidal and that is expected to be stable. Thus, our simulations show that magnetic fields in massive stars can originate from a merger of two main sequence stars.",

The observations were performed during a low state, permitting us for the first time to determine the contact points of the white dwarf. Using LCURVE we could determine its size, and hence mass, with a direct method and with unprecedented accuracy. We determined the mass of the white dwarf as 0.78 +- 0.02 Msun, the mass ratio Q= MWD / Msec = 4.59, and the orbital inclination i=87.4 +- 0.9. An extended warm region with a central temperature of ~33,000 K was observed in the u-band at the location of the previous high-state accretion spot. Weak accretion was ongoing in the low state that led to cyclotron emission that could best be studied with the r-band data. It has a diameter of only 3deg to 4deg and is located much closer to the binary meridian than the accretion-heated region studied in the u-band. The longitudinal shift of the two accretion regions is of order 30deg, due to early and late coupling of accreted matter onto the magnetic field lines in low and high accretion states, respectively. The low-state cyclotron-emitting region has a vertical extent of 0.005 - 0.016 Rwd, a value that seems to be correlated to the instantaneous accretion rate.",

Townsend, Emmanouil Zapartas 24 pages, 10 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present a systematic comparison between the tidal secular evolution timescales predicted by the direct numerical method and those given by the commonly used semi-analytic prescriptions implemented in 1-D hydrostatic binary evolution codes. Our study focuses on binary systems with intermediate- to high-mass primaries ($M_1 = 5$-$50\\,M_\\odot$), companion masses between $1.4\\,M_\\odot$ and $10\\,M_\\odot$, and orbital periods ranging from 0.5 to 50 days. Before mass transfer, both approaches predict synchronization and orbital decay timescales that agree within $\\sim$2 orders of magnitude and typically exceed the stellar main sequence lifetime, implying negligible tidal impact on secular orbital evolution. However, the implied dissipation channels differ, and the differences become more pronounced once mass transfer begins. To test the theoretical predictions against observations, we apply both approaches to the well-characterized PSR J0045--7319 system, which has an orbital decay timescale of 0.5 Myr. The numerical solution reveals strong resonances with internal gravity waves, bringing the predicted orbital period change rate close to the observed value. In contrast, the semi-analytic prescriptions predict orbital decay timescales longer than the Hubble time. These results suggest that for population studies, modestly calibrated parameterized equations may suffice, but for individual systems, reliable interpretation requires direct numerical approaches.",

      "abstract": "Tales of stellar and binary co-evolution, told by stellar oscillations - Binary demographics and their impact on stellar mass, orbits, and age estimates in main-sequence and red-giant stars Paul G. Beck Accepted for publication in Astronomy&Astrophysics (14 pages, 9 Figures, 2 online tables) Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Red giants are increasingly used as stellar population tracers due to their well-understood evolution and the availability of asteroseismic observables. However, stellar binarity can alter observable properties and introduce strong biases. We aim to provide a holistic picture of the binary population and its evolution in the red giant phase by characterizing a sample of binaries hosting oscillating red giants from a combination of extensive asteroseismic, spectroscopic, and astrometric surveys. We investigate the binary properties of evolved stars in the APOKASC3 and APO-K2 catalogs, leveraging asteroseismic constraints and Gaia DR3 non-single-star solutions. We explore the mass distribution of red-giant binary systems and analyze the evolution of their binary fraction. For stars with M$\\leq$1.8M$_\\odot$, we find binary fractions $\\sim$31% and $\\sim$41% for oscillating and non-oscillating solar-like stars on the main-sequence (MS). By the power excess ($\\nu_\\mathrm{max}$) as luminosity proxy, we detect a binary attrition of $\\sim$69% and $\\sim$81% on the low- and high-luminosity red-giant branch (RGB) and an additional $\\sim$38% to the red clump (RC), with respect to the MS. Binaries hosting RC and secondary clump stars (2RC) stars are largely depleted at $P_\\mathrm{orb}\\lesssim$500 and $\\lesssim$200 days, respectively. Mass-dependent differences in binary fractions and orbital properties point to more substantial binary attrition for stars with M $\\leq$1.8 M$_\\odot$. The distinct mass distributions and the depletion of short-period binaries during the red-giant phase underscore the impact of stellar expansion and binary interactions on stellar evolution. RC systems with $P_\\mathrm{orb}\\lesssim$800 to 1,000 days are likely shaped by past interactions, such as mass transfer or loss, which can lead to significantly biased age estimates if not accounted for.",

Magneto-convection drives the complexity of magnetic fields that emerge above the photosphere. This complexity is dissipated, together with that of the overlying pre-existing fields, through dynamic events such as flares. A period of stable \"ordinary\" coronal heating ensues, before the concentrated fields are dissipated through interactions with the surrounding environment. The evolution of coronal abundances can be explained by the First Ionisation Potential (FIP) effect operating within this framework. We extend the discussion from magnetic activity on timescales of active region lifetimes (months), to the solar cycle (years), and stellar evolution (eons). The broad picture shows intriguing similarities that may prompt new investigations.",

Comments welcome Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Sun-like stars are known to host a paucity of brown dwarf companions at close separations. Direct imaging surveys of intermediate-mass stars have suggested that the brown dwarf desert may be fundamentally a feature in the mass ratio. Microlensing surveys provide a unique opportunity to investigate the nature of this desert around low mass stars, as microlensing hosts have typical masses of 0.05-0.8 $M_\\odot$. Here, we perform a statistical analysis of homogeneously selected binary-lens microlensing events in the literature, and identify a companion mass-ratio desert at $0.02\\lesssim q\\lesssim0.05$ and projected separations around 1-5 au. We derive a statistically significant truncation to the giant-planet mass-ratio distribution at $q\\simeq0.02$, above which the occurrence rate density drops by approximately an order of magnitude. Due to the possibility that the small number of detected companions in this desert orbit white dwarfs, this mass-ratio desert may be closer to being completely dry around main-sequence stars. Below this desert, we derive a giant-planet ($q>4\\times10^{-4}$) occurrence rate density of $5.8\\pm0.8$% per decade of projected separation. Our analysis furthers the hypothesis that the brown dwarf desert is fundamentally a feature in the mass ratio, separating distinct populations of planetary and non-planetary companions that are likely formed via core accretion and gravitational instability, respectively. The persistence of this desert across stellar types suggests that both gas-giant planets and sub-stellar companions form in a scale-invariant fashion, with planets growing to a maximum of approximately 2% their host masses.",

The discovery of warm, fluorescent gas in a debris disk is the first such detection ever made. The detection of warm CO raises the possibility of unseen molecules (H$_2$O, H$_2$, etc) as collisional partners to excite the warm gas. We estimated a lower mass limit for CO of $1.25\\times 10^{-7}\\text{M}_{\\oplus}$, which is $10^{-5}$ of the cold CO mass detected with ALMA and HST. We demonstrate that UV fluorescence emerges as a promising avenue for detecting tenuous gas at $10^{-7}$ Earth-mass level in debris disks with JWST.",

Thermal emission spectropolarimetry offers complementary sensitivity to these atmospheric characteristics. Previous studies have shown that linear polarization in fixed bandpasses depends on emission angle, temperature profile, and cloud scattering. In this study, we revisit these dependencies, emphasizing the wavelength-dependent effects that shape polarized spectra. We show that thermal polarization spectrum is primarily governed by: (1) a combination of temperature, temperature gradient, and wavelength; (2) cloud particle size; and (3) cloud optical thickness. Using the 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code ARTES, we simulate polarization spectra from a modeled 1D atmosphere. We find that, for a fixed cloud optical thickness, the polarization exhibits peaks at size parameters near 0.2 and 1. However, the dependence on cloud optical thickness is more pronounced and tends to dominate the broadband polarization. We further show that much narrower polarization features in molecular absorption band, can in principle trace the local temperature gradient at the photosphere of each wavelength. Future low-resolution (resolving power around 100) spectropolarimeter operating at 1-2 micron with sensitivities of 1e-5 would be able to capture these polarization features, and may provide a new diagnostic for breaking degeneracies that commonly affect flux-only retrievals. This work represents an incremental step toward the challenging goal of jointly interpreting atmosphere from both intensity and polarization spectra.",

Their formation involves dust grain growth of many orders of magnitude and a myriad of processes operating at time scales from a few tens to millions of years. Thus, investigating the formation and evolution of young stellar objects (YSOs) is of great importance in modern astronomy. Addressing this goal requires overcoming long-standing challenges in characterizing multifaceted phenomena that span a broad range of astrophysical processes (from protoplanetary disk evolution and planet formation to accretion dynamics and transient stellar events). Also, YSOs are complex systems that consist of several components: a central forming object, surrounded by a medium or disk from which the accretion process is at work, supersonic ejection of plasma in the form of collimated bipolar jets (which interact with the ambient medium through which they propagate) and all these components emit in a wide range of wavelengths. A facility capable of simultaneously tackling these diverse questions must deliver long-term, high-cadence spectroscopic monitoring of YSOs over time spans of at least a decade; especially because accretion/ejection processes in YSOs are characterized by a wide range of temporal variability: from short-term (hours-days) to long-term (months-years) variability due to rotation, accretion, magnetic activity, etc. Such a mission demands a spectroscopic platform considering a solid time-domain astronomy framework, providing repeated observations over wide fields and supporting multiple cadence strategies tailored to distinct scientific objectives.",

Phase-folded light curve images and period information were used from five different variable star types: Classical and Type II Cepheids, {\\delta} Scuti stars, eclipsing binaries, and RR Lyrae stars. The data is taken from the 17th data release of ZTF, from which we used two passbands, g and r in this project. The periods were calculated from the raw data and this information was used as an additional numerical input in the neural network. For the training and testing process a supervised machine learning method was created, the neural network contains Convolutional Neural Networks concatenated with Fully Connected Layers. During the training-validation process the training accuracy reached 99% and the validation accuracy peaked at 95.6%.

Their supposed progenitors are either $\\simeq 0.3M_{\\odot}$ shell H-burning stars or $\\simeq 1.0M_{\\odot}$ core He-burning stars, both relying on mass loss or a merger event in a (rarely observed) close interacting binary system. With the goal to understand the stellar masses of BLAPs, we therefore carried out a linear non-adiabatic analysis of a grid of models computed using mesa-rsp, with appropriate input stellar parameters $ZXMLT_{\\rm eff}$ and convection parameter sets. We discuss the impact of stellar mass, metallicity, helium abundance and convection parameters on the theoretical instability regions of BLAPs. We also derive new theoretical period relations; our theoretical period relations using low stellar masses seem to be in better agreement with the observed period relations. Although only two BLAPS have been observed to be multi-periodic oscillator so far, we analyse theoretical $P_{1O}/P_F$ ratios and compare these values with other classical pulsators. Furthermore, we provide the first asteroseismic mass estimate for the triple-mode pulsator, OGLE-BLAP-030 which seems to be well-constrained in the range of $0.62-0.64 M_{\\odot}$ with a high metallicity of $Z=0.07$, albeit with a few sources of uncertainty involved. This would place the BLAP star intermediate to the two proposed mass scenarios so far.",

Accepted for publication in ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Coronagraph observations provide key information about the orientation of the Sun's magnetic field. Previous studies used various algorithms to segment quasi-radial features in coronagraph images and approximate their local plane-of-sky geometry and orientation which can be used as input for optimizing and constraining coronal magnetic field models. We present a new framework that allows for further quantitative evaluations of image-based coronal segmentation methods against magnetic field models, and vice-versa. We compare quasi-radial features identified from QRaFT, a global coronal feature tracing algorithm, in white-light coronagraph images to outputs of MAS, an advanced magnetohydrodynamic model. We use the FORWARD toolset to produce synthetic polarized brightness images co-aligned to real coronagraph observations, segment features in these images, and quantify the difference between the inferred and model magnetic field. This approach allows us to geometrically compare features segmented in artificial images to those segmented in white-light coronagraph observations against the plane-of-sky projected MAS coronal magnetic field. We quantify QRaFT's performance in the artificial images and observational data, and perform statistical analyses that measure the accuracy and uncertainty of the model output to the observational data. The results demonstrate that a coronal segmentation method identifies the global large-scale orientation of the coronal magnetic field within $\\sim\\pm10^\\circ$ of the plane-of-sky projected MAS magnetic field.",

      "abstract": "On the origin of the dominant waves in the extended solar corona Forrest Mozer, Oleksiy Agapitov, Orlando Romeo, Vadim Roytershteyn, Andrii Voshchepynets Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) The extended solar corona at 10-30 solar radii is essentially devoid of all waves below 100 kHz other than triggered ion acoustic waves (TIAW), which consist of a low frequency electromagnetic wave at a frequency of a few Hz coupled to one or more electrostatic waves at a few hundred Hz, such that the amplitudes of the higher frequency waves peak at a fixed phase of each low frequency wave period. All the waves in a TIAW event travel at the same phase speed, which is found to be 150 km/sec (the ion acoustic speed was about 100 km/sec). It has not been possible to explain the TIAW as a resonant wave-wave interaction, so a non-resonant interaction has been considered in which the loss of energy by the low frequency wave is used to both heat the electrons and grow the higher frequency waves. Evidence in support of this explanation is described and a PIC simulation that discusses this process is summarized. This simulation demonstrates wave-particle interactions driven by the enhanced LF fluctuations, which subsequently modify the proton VDF and create conditions favorable for the growth of HF waves. This interplay between a pair of waves, mediated by modifications of plasma parameters and energy conversion, represents a significant nonlinear process in plasma physics, the study of which will deepen the understanding of energy transfer, wave generation, and plasma dynamics in diverse astrophysical environments.",

Wong, Gonzalo Holgado, Matteo Cantiello Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) High-resolution spectroscopic measurements of OB stars are important for understanding processes like stellar evolution, but require labor-intensive observations. In contrast, photometric missions like the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) can monitor hundreds of thousands of stars with a range of temporal resolutions, but do not provide such detailed measurements. With surveys like the Legacy Survey of Space and Time promising unprecedented photometric coverage over the next ten years, it is increasingly important to develop methods that connect large-scale time-series photometry with the detailed stellar parameter measurements typically derived from spectroscopy. In this paper, we test whether machine learning can recover such parameters by combining TESS light curves with spectroscopic measurements from the IACOB project, using a sample of 285 light curves from 106 unique O stars. Using both multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate that (1) O star light curves contain sufficient information to meaningfully infer stellar parameters and (2) periodograms derived from light curves capture substantially more information than previously identified correlation parameters. Our best model achieves moderate success in predicting both spectroscopic luminosity ($R^2 = 0.641_{-0.167}^{+0.107}$) and effective temperature ($R^2 = 0.443_{-0.234}^{+0.056}$), key stellar parameters for determining positions of stars on the spectroscopic Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, despite the small dataset size. Further progress will require expanded datasets of matched photometric and spectroscopic observations.",

Slight increase in obliquity from initial arXiv submission Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Thousands of tight ($<1$ AU) main sequence binaries have been discovered, but it is uncertain how they formed. There is likely too much angular momentum in a collapsing, fragmenting protostellar cloud to form such binaries in situ, suggesting some post processing. One probe of a binary's dynamical history is the angle between the stellar spin and orbital axes -- its obliquity. The classical method for determining stellar obliquity is the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. It has been applied to over 100 hot Jupiters, but less than a dozen stellar binaries. In this paper, we present the Rossiter-McLaughlin measurement of EBLM J0021-16, a $0.19M_\\odot$ M-dwarf eclipsing a $1.05M_\\odot$ G-dwarf on a 5.97 day, almost-circular orbit. We combine CORALIE spectroscopy with TESS photometry and a measured primary star rotation period of 7.04 days, according to star spot modulation. We show that the orbital axis is misaligned with the primary star's spin axis, with a true 3D obliquity of $\\psi=28.9\\pm2.1^{\\circ}$. EBLM J0021-16, being neither spin-orbit aligned nor synchronized, yet with an almost circular orbit, is a curious case for tidal evolution in tight binaries. It becomes one of a handful of eclipsing binaries with true obliquity measurements. Finally, we derive the M-dwarf's mass and radius to a fractional precision better than 1\\%. The radius of the M-dwarf is inflated by 6\\% ($7.4\\sigma$) with respect to stellar models, consistent with many other M-dwarfs in the literature.",

      "abstract": "A Correlation Between the Final Separation and Mass Ratio from Common Envelope Simulations Sarah V. Borges 18 pages, 7 figures, accepted to ApJ Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Analytical models for common envelope evolution (CEE), particularly the energy formalism, are used in binary population synthesis to predict post-CEE configurations. This formalism is based on an efficiency parameter alpha, which relates the orbital energy released during CEE to that required to unbind the envelope of the giant. However, one of the main challenges is that CEE is a multiscale, multiphysics process. As a result, there may not be a universal value for alpha, or even a general expression. Using 13 3D simulations of CEE with RGBs (1 and 2 M$_\\odot$ primary; four mass ratios; with and without corotation), we present an empirical linear correlation between the post-plunge-in separation and the mass ratio, normalized by the giant radius. This trend for the plunge-in phase of CEE persists across RGB, AGB, and supergiant simulations in the literature, even for partially bound envelopes. Therefore, alpha from simulations should not be used to predict the final separation, but rather as a diagnostic of whether sufficient orbital energy has been liberated to completely eject the envelope immediately after the radial plunge. If this condition is not met, further in-spiral is expected in later stages of CEE, which may explain why the final separation of post-CEE observations is generally smaller than those predicted by the linear fit. Our results reinforce the idea that a better description could emerge if CEE is treated as a sequence of distinct phases, rather than treating it as a single event governed by alpha.",

Simulations are carried out with the kglobal model, which produces bulk heating and the extended powerlaw distributions of both species that have been documented in observations. The simulations have been carried out with a range of proton-to-electron mass ratios and upstream temperatures to isolate the factors that control energy gain. The simulations reveal that when the upstream temperatures of the two species are equal, the proton heating and energization exceeds that of electrons and that this is a consequence of the much larger energy gain of protons on their first entry into the reconnection exhaust. The effective energy gain of protons on exhaust entry scales as $m_iC_A^2$ since the protons counterstream at the Alfvén speed $C_A$ while the initial electron energy gain is smaller by the factor $(\\beta_{e0}m_e/m_i)^{1/2}$. Since Fermi reflection during flux rope merger dominates energy gain in large-scale reconnecting systems and the rate of energy gain is proportional to energy, protons continue to gain energy faster than electrons for the duration of the simulations, leading to temperature increments of protons exceeding that of electrons and the non-thermal energy content of protons also exceeding that of electrons.",

Jones et al 2025 ApJL 995 L41 Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present confirmation of HD 143811 AB b, a substellar companion to spectroscopic binary HD 143811 AB through direct imaging with the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) and Keck NIRC2. HD 143811 AB was observed as a part of the Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet Survey (GPIES) in 2016 and 2019 and is a member of the Sco-Cen star formation region. The exoplanet is detected $\\sim 430$ mas from the host star by GPI. With two GPI epochs and one from Keck/NIRC2 in 2022, we confirm through common proper motion analysis that the object is bound to its host star. We derive an orbit with a semi-major axis of $64 ^{+32}_{-14}$ au and eccentricity ${0.23 ^{+0.24}_{-0.16}}$. Spectral analysis of the GPI $H$-band spectrum and NIRC2 \\textit{L'} photometry provides additional proof that this object is a substellar companion. We compare the spectrum of HD 143811 AB b to PHOENIX stellar models and Exo-REM exoplanet atmosphere models and find that Exo-REM models provide the best fits to the data. From the Exo-REM models, we derive an effective temperature of $1042^{+178}_{-132}$ K for the planet and translate the derived luminosity of the planet to a mass of $5.6 \\pm 1.1~M_\\textrm{Jup}$ assuming hot-start evolutionary models. HD 143811 AB b is the first directly imaged planet around a binary that is not on an ultra-wide orbit. Future characterization of this object will shed light on the formation of planets around binary star systems.",

Patchy clouds, auroral processes, stratospheric hot spots, and complex carbon chemistry have all been proposed as potential sources of this variability. Using time-resolved, low-to-mid-resolution spectroscopy collected with the JWST/NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments, we apply harmonic analysis to SIMP J013656.5+093347, a highly variable, young, isolated planetary-mass object. Odd harmonics (k = 3) at pressure levels ~ 1 bar, corresponding to iron and forsterite cloud formation, suggest a potential North-South hemispheric asymmetry in the cloudy, and likely equatorial, regions. We use the inferred harmonics, along with 1-D substellar atmospheric models, to map the flux variability by atmospheric pressure level. We identify distinct time-varying structures in the near-infrared that we interpret as planetary-scale wave (e.g., Rossby or Kelvin)-associated cloud modulation. We detect deviations from bulk (composite) variability in water (S/N = 14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands, providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the lowest pressures (< 100 mbar), we find mapped methane lines transition from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral heating via electron precipitation.",

Kasliwal Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) Modern wide-field time-domain surveys facilitate the study of transient, variable and moving phenomena by conducting image differencing and relaying alerts to their communities. Machine learning tools have been used on data from these surveys and their precursors for more than a decade, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which make predictions directly from input images, saw particularly broad adoption through the 2010s. Since then, continually rapid advances in computer vision have transformed the standard practices around using such models. It is now commonplace to use standardized architectures pre-trained on large corpora of everyday images (e.g., ImageNet). In contrast, time-domain astronomy studies still typically design custom CNN architectures and train them from scratch. Here, we explore the affects of adopting various pre-training regimens and standardized model architectures on the performance of alert classification. We find that the resulting models match or outperform a custom, specialized CNN like what is typically used for filtering alerts. Moreover, our results show that pre-training on galaxy images from Galaxy Zoo tends to yield better performance than pre-training on ImageNet or training from scratch. We observe that the design of standardized architectures are much better optimized than the custom CNN baseline, requiring significantly less time and memory for inference despite having more trainable parameters. On the eve of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time and other image-differencing surveys, these findings advocate for a paradigm shift in the creation of vision models for alerts, demonstrating that greater performance and efficiency, in time and in data, can be achieved by adopting the latest practices from the computer vision field.",

In this work, we develop a pipeline to create a semantic search engine from completely unlabeled image data. Our method leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate descriptions for galaxy images, then contrastively aligns a pre-trained multimodal astronomy foundation model with these embedded descriptions to produce searchable embeddings at scale. We find that current VLMs provide descriptions that are sufficiently informative to train a semantic search model that outperforms direct image similarity search. Our model, AION-Search, achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on finding rare phenomena despite training on randomly selected images with no deliberate curation for rare cases. Furthermore, we introduce a VLM-based re-ranking method that nearly doubles the recall for our most challenging targets in the top-100 results. For the first time, AION-Search enables flexible semantic search scalable to 140 million galaxy images, enabling discovery from previously infeasible searches. More broadly, our work provides an approach for making large, unlabeled scientific image archives semantically searchable, expanding data exploration capabilities in fields from Earth observation to microscopy.

      "abstract": "34 pages, 28 figures, and 4 tables. Simple PDF file from Microsoft WORD Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Most discussion of charge-transfer-efficiency (CTE) losses involves the parallel transfer of charge in the y-direction down the chip columns (y-CTE). Serial charge-transfer efficiency (x-CTE) refers to the horizontal transer of charge. Serial CTE losses were first assessed in WFC3/UVIS in 2014 (WFC3/ISR 2014-02), where it was found that bright stars were shifted by roughly 0.0015 pixel away from the readout amplifier. Now that the WFC3/UVIS CCD has spent more than three times as long in space, imperfect serial CTE should have three times the impact on the images, so we revisit the effect and characterize serial CTE in a similar manner to our models for parallel-CTE by using a combination of warm pixels, cosmic rays, saturated stars, and overscan pixels. Overall, serial CTE has a much smaller impact on images than does parallel CTE. As of 2023, parallel CTE can have a roughly 5 percent impact on bright sources and a greater than 50 percent impact on faint sources, and serial CTE can have a roughly 1% impact on bright sources and a roughly 3 percent impact on fainter sources. The first few pixels in the serial CTE trails are much sharper than the parallel trails, but there is a very faint component to the serial trails that extends much farther than the parallel trails, even wrapping around to the next row. We develop a pixel-based model for the trapping and release of charge in the serial register and release a stand-alone beta-version of this pixel-based serial-CTE correction. Most images are not significantly impacted by the x-CTE effect, however HST users that require high-precision astrometry could benefit from this correction. At the very least, curious users can quantify its potential impact on their science.",

The age profiles reveal a characteristic knowledge-use cycle: citations rise over $\\sim$2--4 years, approach saturation by $\\sim$10--12 years, underscoring limits of short-window impact metrics. Journals published by European and North American astronomical organizations sustain higher impact, whereas PASJ generally lies below the world baseline. In parallel, PASJ shows episodic above-baseline impact through facility- or mission-driven special issues and features that, given the journal's modest annual volume, can materially shift year-level metrics. These patterns point to two potential avenues for PASJ: well-timed, thoughtfully organized special issues and features that highlight high-impact results, and continued strengthening of international collaboration.",

The Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (SCT) is a dual-mirror candidate design for a CTAO Medium-Sized Telescope (MST). The prototype Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (pSCT) was inaugurated in 2019 at Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO) in Arizona and observed significant gamma-ray emission from the Crab Nebula with a partially populated camera. The pSCT camera is currently being upgraded to fully instrument the focal plane with 11,328 silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) pixels split between 177 camera modules. Additionally, the modules will feature upgraded electronics designed to reduce electronics crosstalk and noise. A module calibration procedure has been developed using a preproduction test module. Following this calibration procedure, performance testing shows that the upgrade module has low noise, minimal electronics crosstalk, and excellent charge resolution. After calibration and optimization, the 177 production modules will be installed in the pSCT camera for commissioning. This will be followed by observations of known VHE gamma-ray sources for camera performance validation.",

While already established in amplitude interferometry, for the recently expanding field of intensity interferometers the closure phase enables recovering information of the interferometric phases that are otherwise inaccessible with this technique. To extract the (cosine of) the closure phase ($\\cos \\phi$) in intensity interferometry, third-order correlations between three simultaneously measuring telescopes have to be computed. As the signal-to-noise of such three-photon correlations is too small for current generation intensity interferometers, no third-order correlations of astrophysical targets have been recorded so far. In this paper we present the first measurements of third order correlation functions of two stellar systems, Nunki ($\\sigma $ Sgr) and Dschubba ($\\delta$ Sco), observed with the H.E.S.S. intensity interferometer in 2023. We show how to isolate the three-photon contribution term from the two-photon contributions, in order to access $\\cos \\phi$. For the observed stellar targets the sensitivity is not high enough to extract closure phase information. To demonstrate that the analysis works well we further extract $\\cos \\phi$ in a laboratory experiment, using the H.E.S.S. intensity interferometer and a pseudo-thermal light source.",

Comments welcome! 20 pages, 16 figures Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics concept aims to map large areas with spectral coverage and sensitivities inaccessible to previous FIR space telescopes, covering 25-235um. We synthesise images representing a deep imaging survey, with realistic instrumental and confusion noise, reflecting the latest PRIMAger instrument specifications. We present a new Bayesian modelling approach XID+stepwise that exploits PRIMAger's hyperspectral imaging to derive self-consistent, informative flux priors by sequentially propagating constraints from short to long wavelengths. With Euclid-like prior source positions, this method recovers fluxes to within 20% to 0.2-0.7 mJy across 45-84 um, which correspond to factors of 1.3-3.4 fainter than the confusion limit. For the most confusion-dominated channels, accurate fluxes are measured to 0.9, 2.5, 7.6 and 14.8 mJy at 92, 126, 183 and 235 um, respectively, which are factors of 3-5 better than the confusion limit. Using a deeper Euclid-based prior catalogue and weak ancillary flux priors at 25 um yields further improvements, reaching up to a factor ~7 fainter than the confusion limit at 96 um. Additionally, we demonstrate that positional priors from blind source detection followed by deblending via XID+ enables PRIMAger to achieve sensitivity beyond the confusion limits using PRIMAger data alone. We show that IR-luminous galaxies at z~2 are robustly detected in a large fraction of the PRIMAger channels (>98% in 12 out of the 16 considered channels), providing dense sampling of the FIR SED even for sources several factors below the confusion limit. We explore the impact on our results for a range of systematic effects, including cirrus contamination, optical degradation, and calibration uncertainties. These findings indicate that confusion noise will not limit the key science from PRIMA extragalactic imaging surveys when employing XID+.",

B. Rimmer, Liton Majumdar Submitted to The Astrophysical Journal (ApJ). 25 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Sulfur chemistry is fundamental to understanding the structure, cloud formation, and atmospheric composition of Venus and Venus-like exoplanets. However, many key reactions involving ground- and excited-state sulfur species remain poorly characterized, and current photochemical models rely on networks that lack accurate kinetic data under high-temperature, high-CO2 conditions. We compute kinetic parameters for reactions of ground-state S(3P) and excited-state S(1D) with CO2 under Venus-like conditions. These reactions form SO(3Sigma), SO(1Delta), and CO. The potential energy surfaces reveal intermediates, and temperature-dependent rate coefficients are obtained using a master-equation approach based on the chemically significant eigenvalue method. NASA 7-term polynomial coefficients are also derived for ground- and excited-state S and SO for consistent use in photochemical models. Incorporating these data into the one-dimensional photochemical model XODIAC shows that these reactions exert only a minor influence above 60 km in the Venus atmosphere due to competing pathways. The model agrees with observations for most sulfur-bearing species except S3 and S4. Introducing a 1 ppm near-surface atomic sulfur mixing ratio, representing a possible deep-atmosphere or surface source or accounting for missing sulfur processes, increases S3 and S4 by 1-2 orders of magnitude and improves agreement with measurements. For exo-Venus analogs with stratospheric isotherms and strong stellar irradiation, the new reactions significantly modify the vertical profiles of major sulfur species above 30 km and enhance S(1D) and SO(1Delta) more strongly than in scenarios with only isotherms or only irradiation. These results underscore the importance of accurate excited-state sulfur kinetics and the need for updated reaction networks when modeling Venus and exo-Venus atmospheres.",

Conclusive observation of IMBHs remained elusive until the detection of gravitational-wave (GW) signal GW190521, which lies with high confidence in the mass gap predicted by the pair-instability mechanism. Despite falling in the sensitivity band of current GW detectors, IMBH searches are challenging due to their similarity to transient bursts of detector noise, known as glitches. In this proof-of-concept work, we combine a matched-filter algorithm with a Machine Learning (ML) method to differentiate IMBH signals from non-transient burst noise, known as glitches. In particular, we build a multi-layer perceptron network to perform a multi-class classification of the output triggers of matched-filter. In this way we are able to distinguish simulated GW IMBH signals from different classes of glitches that occurred during the third observing run (O3) {in single detector data}. {We train, validate, and test our model on O3a data, reaching a true positive rate of over $90\\%$ for simulated IMBH signals. To test the generalization ability over the evolutionary observing run, we test on the useen data of O3b, which yields a true positive rate of over $70\\%$} . We also combine data from multiple detectors to search for simulated IMBH signals in real detector noise, providing a significance measure for the output of our ML method.",

Here, we statistically validate five new transiting Earth and super-Earth sized planets orbiting M dwarf stars using a combination of light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, multi-color observations from Palomar and Las Cumbres Observatory, high-resolution imaging, and stellar spectroscopy. The sample includes: TOI-5716 b, an Earth-sized planet (R_p = 0.96 $\\pm$ 0.05 Rearth) with a 6.766-day orbit around a metal-poor thin-disk star ([Fe/H] = -0.54 $\\pm$ 0.10); TOI-5728 b, a super-Earth (R_p = 1.31 $\\pm$ 0.05 Rearth) on an 11.497-day orbit; and TOI-5736 b, a larger planet (R_p = 1.56 $\\pm$ 0.07 Rearth) with an ultra-short period of just 0.649 days. We also statistically validate a multi-planet system, TOI-5489, hosting two similarly-sized super-Earths: TOI-5489 b (R_p = 1.40 $\\pm$ 0.05 R_earth) and TOI-5489 c (R_p = 1.28 $\\pm$ 0.07 R_earth) with orbital periods of 3.152 and 4.921 days, respectively. Due to their longer orbital periods, TOI-5716 b and TOI-5728 b both have equilibrium temperatures $\\leq$ 400 K, making them useful test cases for studies of atmospheric mass loss. If TOI-5728 b is confirmed to have an Earth-like bulk composition, it would join the very small sample of rocky planets orbiting mid- to late-M dwarfs that lie below the cosmic shoreline and therefore may have retained high mean molecular weight atmospheres.",

Rotational instability of rubble-pile asteroids can trigger mass shedding, forming transient debris clouds that may provide the initial conditions for secondary formation in binary systems. Aims. We investigate the dynamical and collisional evolution of a debris cloud numerically generated around a Didymos-like progenitor, as a representative case for the early formation of Dimorphos. The analysis focuses on the growth and structural properties of clusters composed of centimetre- to decimetre-scale particles. Methods. We perform full-scale simulations of debris evolution around a near-critically rotating asteroid using a cross-spatial-scale approach combined with the discrete element method (DEM). To overcome computational timescale limitations, an equivalent cluster-scale simulation framework is introduced to capture the essential collisional growth processes efficiently. These simulations quantify the efficiency of cluster growth and the structural evoution within the debris cloud. Results. Our simulations reveal that particles shed from a rotationally unstable asteroid exhibit a consistent migration pattern toward low-geopotential regions, which governs the mass distribution and dynamical structure of the debris cloud. The collisional velocity are well described by a Weibull distribution (lambda = 0.0642, k = 1.8349), where low-velocity impacts favor accretion. These collisions enable clusters to grow from centimeter-decimeter scales to meter-sized bodies, developing compact, moderately porous structures (Delta I \\approx 0.8, phi \\approx 0.52). Collisions between meter-sized clusters do not exhibit a bouncing barrier: low-velocity impacts yield Dinkinesh-like shapes, while moderate velocities promote plastic merging and continued growth.",

This study aims to investigate the distribution of micron-sized dust particles in the Flying Saucer (BKLT J162813-243139) in Rho Ophiuchi, leveraging the unique observational conditions of a bright infrared background that enables the edge-on disc to be seen in both silhouette and scattered light at certain, specific wavelengths. As part of the JWST Edge-on Disc Ice program ('JEDIce'), we use NIRSpec IFU observations of the Flying Saucer, serendipitously observed against a PAH-emitting background, to constrain the dust distribution and grain sizes through radiative transfer modelling. Observation of the Flying Saucer in silhouette at 3.29 microns reveals that the midplane radial extent of small dust grains is ~235 au, larger than the large-grain disc extent previously determined to be 190 au from millimetre data. The scattered light observed in emission probes micron sized icy grains at large vertical distances above the midplane. The vertical extent of the disc silhouette is similar at visible, near-IR, and mid-IR wavelengths, corroborating the conclusion that dust settling is inefficient for grains as large as tens of microns, vertically and radially.",

Kempton 21 pages, 8 figures, Accepted by Astrophysical Journal Letters Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Some low-density exoplanets are thought to be water-rich worlds that formed beyond the snow line of their protoplanetary disc, possibly accreting coequal portions of rock and water. However, the compositions of bodies within the Solar System and the stability of volatile-rich solids in accretionary disks suggest that a planet rich in water should also acquire as much as 40% refractory organic carbon (``soot''). This would reduce the water mass fraction well below 50%, making the composition of these planets similar to those of Solar System comets. Here we show that soot-rich planets, with or without water, can account for the low average densities of exoplanets that were previously attributed to a binary combination of rock and water. Formed in locations beyond the soot and/or snow lines in disks, these planets are likely common in our galaxy and already observed by JWST. The surfaces and interiors of soot-rich planets will be influenced by the chemical and physical properties of carbonaceous phases, and the atmospheres of such planets may contain plentiful methane and other hydrocarbons, with implications for photochemical haze generation and habitability.",

Comments still welcome! Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Far fewer gas giants have been caught in their accretion phase than mature ones are known. Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) instruments will have a higher sensitivity and a smaller inner working angle than instruments up to now, which should allow more productive searches and detailed characterisation. We study the observability of accreting gas giants with METIS, the first-generation ELT spectrograph. We focus on the accretion-tracing hydrogen recombination lines accessible at a resolution R=1e5, mainly Brackett alpha and Pfund-series lines. Our approach is general but we take PDS 70 b as a fiducial case. To calculate high-resolution line profiles, we combine a semianalytical multidimensional description of the flow onto an accreting planet and its circumplanetary disc (CPD) with local non-equilibrium shock-emission models. We assume the limiting scenario of no extinction appropriate for gas giants in gaps and negligible contribution from magnetospheric accretion columns. We use simulated detector sensitivities to compute required observing times. Both the planet surface and the CPD surface shocks contribute to the total line profile, which is non-Gaussian and much narrower than the free-fall velocity. For the adopted baseline accretion rate onto PDS 70 b, the Br alpha line peak is equal to the photospheric continuum modulated mostly by water features. However, the rotation of the planet broadens the features, helping the shock excess stand out. At Br alpha, already the continuum of PDS 70 b should yield SNR=12 in 4 h. The peak excess should require only about 15 min to reach SNR=3. Br alpha is a potent planet formation tracer accessible to METIS in little integration time. Resolved line profiles will place independent constraints especially on the mass and radius of an accreting planet, and help identify the accretion mechanism(s) at work.",

Kobayashi, P. Scicluna, S. T. Zeegers 14 pages, 9 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in MNRAS Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Determination of the composition and size distribution of dust grains in debris discs is strongly dependent on constraining the underlying spatial distribution of that dust through multi-wavelength, spatially resolved imaging spanning near-infrared to millimetre wavelengths. To date, spatially resolved imaging exists for well over a hundred debris disc systems. Simple analytical radiative transfer models of debris dust emission can reveal trends in disc properties as a function of their host stars' luminosities. Here we present such an analysis for 133 debris discs, calculating the dust grain minimum sizes ($s_{\\rm min}$), dust masses ($M_{\\rm dust}$), and exponents of the size distribution ($q$) in conjunction with their architectures determined at far-infrared or millimetre wavelengths. The distribution of $q$ at far-infrared to millimetre wavelengths is characterised for the first time, finding a value of $3.49^{+0.38}_{-0.33}$. We further newly identify a trend between $q$ and $R_{\\rm disc}$, which may be indicative of velocity dependent fragmentation, or grain growth at large radii. We find the disc masses inferred from this analysis are consistent with those of protoplanetary discs. Finally, we identify samples of debris discs suitable for further characterisation at millimetre and centimetre wavelengths, expanding the number of spatially resolved systems upon which future studies of these statistics can be based.",
